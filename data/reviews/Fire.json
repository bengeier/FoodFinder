{"text":"Their porkchop and brussel sprouts are to die for! I've only been here once, but, the selection seemed vast, the prices seemed fair and the entrees were delectable. I would recommend this to those who enjoy good food and an awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fire has never disappointed before, and our most recent visit was no exception. My wife and I went for a late brunch on a snowy Sunday a few weeks ago. Even with a lower energy level and smaller crowd of diners given the hour of our meal, the place still had a warm feel to it. I was very pleased with my selection of the pastrami hash - tasty and filling, but not too heavy. The service experience (from valet parking to seating to the wait staff) was strong as usual. Two thumbs up for this Shaker Square gem."}
{"text":"Fire Food & Drink is superb! I've been here for brunch and for dinner and both were fantastic. The service is great, the restaurant decor and overall ambience is so warm and stylish, and the menu is quite diverse. You'll have little problem finding something delicious and exciting to eat if you're a carnivore or a GF vegan. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I had not been here for a few years because I had a terrible experience the last time with service. This was restaurant week, and we decided to try this restaurant again to give it the benefit of doubt since so many people seem to love it. We ordered the small plate menu and I have to say, the first course of arugula  salad with mushrooms and the second course of crab cake with brussels sprouts was fairly good. However, the time between getting our drinks, getting our food and get our courses was extremely long, despite the emptiness of the restaurant. We then waited over 30 minutes to get our dessert and, when we inquired, only one was almost ready. Unfortunately, our waitress had very poor customer service skills and was a bit militant when we asked her about our desserts. We left after paying our entire bill, never receiving the desserts and never receiving any refunds. I didn't hate the food, but I did not care for the service at all, and Fire has now closed for me."}
{"text":"Bad service.  Inexperienced waitress.  Messed up credit card transaction and charged the bill but told us the card did not work but it actually did work. Female Manager wouldnt give us the time of day.  Bad service.  Better restaurants in cleveland hts.  Not going back."}
{"text":"The whole family went to brunch here!  The shrimp fried rice, fire Benedict, and almond strawberry French toast were all great dishes!  The coffee was rich and flavorful.  Our waiter, Christopher, was spot on!  The restaurant was quite busy and crowded and we did not wait at all.  Every employee was helpful, courteous, and friendly.  Only one disappointment - the breakfast pizza was way too heavy, too laden with cheese and too oily in the center.  Lighten up on the ingredients and we would give the pizza another try!"}
{"text":"Quality food, good location, great portions, but only decent service. It probably was just our server, but for a 4 top it took 2 1/2 hrs for dinner."}
{"text":"A quiet corner of a big city. 
A changing menu with a unique blend of flavors (yet keeping they keep the favorites) - keeps me returning for something new yet comfortably familiar. 
A knowledgable friendly staff with an excellent service-oriented style & grace. 
A popular place after a hard work week, but retains a courteous friendly in-rushed flavor."}
{"text":"A+++

First time here and we decided to come for brunch. It was busy!

Food and drink were delicious. I had their Champagne Fire (cava, bitters, sugar cube, etc.) and my partner had their version of an amaretto sour. Both were great.

We started with the cinnamon sugar bread. It was pretty much naan coated in cinnamon sugar. Very good. For my entree I had the duck confit--served with grits, an egg, and arugula. The duck fell right off the bone (as it should) and the grits were cooked perfectly. My partner had the wagyu hash. We both were in love with our entrees and agreed they were the best brunch entrees we have had anywhere.

Fire is pretty affordable too. Four drinks, one starter, and two entrees all for $71. Not bad!

The best part? Doug Katz himself! Katz was actually in the dining room mingling with customers. He looked genuinely happy to be talking with everyone. He even refilled my partner's coffee! Never seen a chef do that!

Will definitely be back to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. Was there twice in two days. One - dinner. We had chicken livers and French buns for appetizers, and walleye and burger for main course. The cocktails were very good too. Sunday brunch was amazing too. We were four people. We had Bloody Mary, smoothie, mimosa and bellini, then fish sandwich, chopped salad, burger and Cesar salad. Soooooo good. I have not lived in Cleveland for 12 years, and was so happy to find the Fire!"}
{"text":"Perfection and Disappointment:  My two visits to Fire.   In the last 6 months I have been to Fire twice, once for dinner and once for Brunch.  My experiences at the restaurant could not have been more different in terms of the quality of the food.  First, let me say that I think that Fire has cornered the market on service.  On each visit, my table was served by an attentive and knowledgeable server who made that experience very nice.  The food, however, was at opposite ends of the spectrum.  
On my first visit, I ordered a duck confit dish (I can't remember the name) that was just fabulous.  I savored each and every bite.  It had been quite awhile since I had eaten something that delectable.  It was just that good.
My second visit was for Brunch this past weekend and I ordered the Fire Benedict (Eggs Benedict).  The hollandaise sauce was nice, but the two eggs were cooked differently:  one had the expected luscious runny yolk and the other was almost completely hard-cooked.  However, it was the ham that was almost comical.  The slice on each egg muffin was what can only be described as wafer-thin - as my mother would have said if she was still alive, \"I could have read the newspaper through it.\"  I don't expect a slab of ham draped over my english muffin, but for $14.00, I would like a bit more than the \"essence of ham\" that I actually had on my eggs benedict.  On the other hand, at that same meal, one of my friends ordered the lemon souffle pancakes and the dish looked and tasted fantastic."}
{"text":"Top quality food. We had the popular lemon soufflé pancakes, eggs, and pastrami hash - all were great. I would also recommend the cappuccino. The hash, as expected, was rich and having some blueberries from the pancakes helped keep the meal from becoming overly so."}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week, and again a week later. In neither case did I pay \"full price\" since it was prix-fixe the first time and a company dinner the next. So, my rating would probably be different if I paid full price here (which is a lot, AKA too much).

The food, wine, and beer were all EXCELLENT. Very nicely done, fairly straightforward dishes with nice accents and very tasty. I had the hangar steak - I normally loathe hangar steak - and it was very good. I had fish the next time, was not as impressed but nothing wrong with it per se. Olive appetizer was fantastic. Dessert (apple crisp) also fantastic.

I liked the atmosphere - open and modern and nicely appointed.

The service was NOT excellent. Our waitress seemed mad at us for no apparent reason...and I think if I'm gonna wear a tie and most in the building are wearing sport jackets then the waitstaff can pony up for nice pants than jeans. WTF?

I WOULD come back if someone else was paying but I think there are other, less rude choices for what ends up being $50-70/pp."}
{"text":"Fire is my favorite Cleveland restaurant. Chef Doug Katz always impresses and often dazzles. And often he even stops by your table. Clearly he loves what he does, and it shows in the imaginative, high-quality food. Expect seasonally appropriate ingredients, locally sourced when possible. The menu is fairly typical \"New American.\" Again, Katz has made this a real institution for foodies, and I suggest signing up for the email list because he offers many special events."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch; fantastic French toast, and very good service. I'm pretty picky about my coffee and thought the coffee was outstanding. One thing I wasn't crazy about was the homemade breakfast sausage but overall my family and I thought the brunch was very nicely done and a good value. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We found Fire when we first moved to Cleveland and it's been a favorite ever since. I had a tandoor-cooked hangar steak that was the best hangar steak I've had. My fiancé swears by the chicken livers.

Aside from the food, the service here has always been stellar."}
{"text":"Mussels.  Probably the best mussels I've ever had.  I've only been to Fire twice, and both times the mussels were absolutely heavenly!  Went on Friday for girls night out and the food was great.  We started with those fabulous mussels, which are bathed in a tomato, fennel and garlic broth.  I would drink that broth with a straw if I could.  We ate so much bread soaking up the broth that I was almost full before my salad came!  I followed up with the mushroom salad, which was perfectly dressed.  You could hardly tell there was any dressing on it, but the braised leek vinaigrette flavor really came through.  I went with the crispy duck confit for my entree and it was also delicious, a must-try for sure.  

Service was attentive but on the slow side, which was fine for us but if you're trying to catch a movie or something you might want to go afterwards.  I've had two great experiences here and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Very solid experience. And, I know it is a small thing, but the valet parking was easy."}
{"text":"It's my husband's birthday and we decided to stop in at one of our favorite restaurants, Fire. Intending to have a quick salad and head out for a movie, we were waylaid by the new menu and great drink menu. I knew my husband would like the Peruvian chicken thighs. It was a toss up for me between the tandoor oven pork chops and the sirloin. I went with the sirloin for a change of pace. The snow peas were prepared perfectly. Sirloin delicious and prepared medium rare as requested. 

Food is always delicious here and the wait staff is professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. 

If you are looking for a great Cleveland dining experience, put Fire Food and Drink on your list."}
{"text":"Great brunch environment.  Pastrami hash was good but covered with way too much cheese.  Dish was not pleasing to the eye and cheese took away from enjoying all of the ingredients.  Good Bloody Mary.  Beware the basic Bloody Mary has lots of horseradish.  I'll go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Impressive! I highly recommend the sticky buns at brunch. Above and beyond service. The brunch menu is out of this world! So many options that it was hard to decide. Everyone in my group was extremely happy with their food and overall experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I were checking out the Shaker/Cleveland Heights area as a possible community to relocate to and we just happened to stop into Fire. The place was packed for Saturday Brunch. One of the beautiful things about the restaurant (besides the DELICIOUS food) is the cross section of patrons that frequent the restaurant. Several different languages could be heard around the tables near us which well represents the culture and diversity of the Shaker/Cleveland Heights area. Prior to our meal, the executive chef came over and introduced himself. We told him we were house hunting and he gave us the name and number of a fabulous real estate agent as well as his personal number with an invitation to contact him if we had additional questions about the area. Prior to even enjoying our scrumptious meal, Fire earned 5 stars for their atmosphere and special attention we received by the executive chef. The food? Oh yeah that was fabulous too. My wife enjoyed the pastrami hash which was out of this world, knock your socks off fantastic. I enjoyed the fish marsala sandwich which was also very tasty. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal and a representation of what the Shaker Heights area has to offer."}
{"text":"I live close to this restaurant, so it's a surprise that I haven't been here until a few weeks ago.  Friends were in town from Columbus and had heard about Fire's brunch so we all decided this would be something to check out.  SO glad we did because it was to die for!  

I can already foresee this review going of FOREVER so I'll try and keep it short!

The bloody mary's are one of the best I've ever had.  If you happen to be a fan of these, don't pass this one up (it comes with a dr. katz's pickle - I'm not sure what that means but I know that it's damn good!). 

Order the sticky buns and the clay oven bread (comes with cinnamon sugar) for an appetizer.  Your mouth will thank you.

As for the main dish, here's what our table ordered:  3 shrimp fried rices (each were part of the clean plate club), lemon souffle pancakes (also part of the clean plate club), and the breakfast pizza (I was part of the clean plate club after I ate the rest of this for a late lunch that day).  All were totally amazing.

So my recommendation is that you brunch it up at Fire.  Oh, and remember to pay the parking meter because if you don't you'll end up with a parting gift of a parking ticket on your windshield like me."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my best friend on a rainy morning, and it really cheered me right up! I got their corned beef hash and it was exactly what my palate was craving. The egg was a tad overcooked, but the flavors were spot on. Cheesy, meaty, a touch of mustard, pepper, potato, onion. I finished my entire dish plus half an order of their lemon souffle pancakes with blueberry compote. I do love a good pancake and they make a mean one. I don't think it's a good entree because it's really just the pancake and the compote, but it's a fantastic dish to share with the table. 
The ambiance is bright and modern, and I'd love to come here to try lunch or dinner sometimes, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent. Tandoor whole fish and pork outstanding. Doug Katz is a great chef."}
{"text":"This was our second visit since they switched to the winter menu and it was excellent.  Service was prompt and all of our meals were prepared as requested.

Much appreciated was the way fire dealt with our son's peanut allergy to set him at ease that everything was safe for him to eat. Between our server and the availability of the executive chef, we were able to confirm any concerns.

We enjoy eating at local places and fire is a favorite. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch. I had the shrimp fried rice and it was so yummy. I also like its location shaker has it ups and downs but this restaurant and food is consistanly good. Great job Fire. Stay in the square you are an anchor!"}
{"text":"We had a most wonderful brunch at this delightful place today! The food was rapturously good: the lemon pancakes were dreamy, with a blueberry compote and dollop of cream: YUM! My husband had the vegan dish, which was also delicious, and he reported it was loaded with robust flavor. We started the meal with the most awesome cinnamon bread...(don't miss it!)..tasted like fragrant cinnamon toast with the best bread ever. My cousins also had wondrous dishes....the croque madame and the almond french toast. We also did a side of (very fresh) fruits and a creamy bowl of goat cheese grits. All in all, a very special meal. The ambience was also crisp, friendly and warmly inviting, and the waiters were attentive and really knowledgeable (helping us to decide WHAT to get from the generous menu.) We even got two chopped salads to go for we had a long ride ahead of us on this day, and when I opened my goody bag later and ate my salad, it was a total treat. Fresh veggies, tender chicken, and delicious cheese. Wow! We all give Fire a THUMBS UP! Two of us are New Yorkers and we will be dreaming of Cleveland and Fire!"}
{"text":"After a snowy Vday, it was nice to have a chance to drive to a quaint restaurant that provides free valet. The hostesses were attentive and courteous. We did not have reservations but she offered to sit us at the counter facing the kitchen. Not a bad location if you didn't mind zero wait time. The only negative was the server helping us. He took 10 minutes to ask us if we wanted a drink and then the drink I ordered never came. When I finally asked another sever to cancel my drink, he pulls up with my drink and says it's on the house. Touché. The brunch menu was exquisite and the variety gave you a hard time to choose. My gf had the Madame and I had the pastrami hash. Both were prepared well and tasted as good as it looked. I recommend the sticky bun for starters. Lovely place to take any love one."}
{"text":"Not crazy about the Lemon Pancakes. Went for brunch on Sunday.  Service was not so great but I really like the decor and ambiance of the restaurant.  It's a great location and I'll be sure to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Best advice: eat before you go. Sometimes you need to go back to a place to remember why you stopped going. We ordered and forty minutes passed...the bartender told us, \"sorry for the wait, we had a power outage and are trying to catch up,\" and we told him it was no problem, and yet the chef/owner was calmly chit chatting with tables like he was the belle of the ball, rather than helping his underwater staff. The food was so bad we laughed uncontrollably. Cheesy grits had no trace of salt and pepper, were very much undercooked and had an uncomfortable gritty yet thin texture much like prison gruel. A positive note, my husband remarked the cereal would aid in peristalsis. Fried rice was like it had been left out in the parking lot overnight and then microwaved. French toast was great, but did not make up for the debacle that Fire Food and Drink remains to be."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to Fire. I visited for Sunday dinner. 

Overall, wonderful atmosphere and service. Food, on the other hand, is very overpriced and overrated. To give them some credit, their brunch is far superior to dinner. 

We came as a party of five. We ordered a bottle of the featured red blend for about $65. I tried some chickpea fritters ($14) and I got the grilled Hawaiian blue marlin ($31). 

The red blend was bland. Chickpea fritters didn't have much flavor and wasn't fried well. The Marlin was way too dry. All the items should cost about half of what they charged. The only compliments regarding the food is the the pickled vegetables on the side of the fritters were tasty. 

Overall - this was a low value, high cost meal. Mediocre food."}
{"text":"We've been to fire before for dinner (always enjoyed it) and decided to try their Sunday brunch this morning.  The mimosas are great (tangy and refreshing) and the breakfast pizza ($9), which is topped with two slices of bacon and two eggs with breakfast potatoes, is fantastic!  The housemade sausage ($4) is lean and pleasantly spicy without feeling greasy.  It's certainly unique and should definitely be tried.

The table next to us was raving over the lemon souffle pancakes with blueberry compote - we'll be sure to try that next time.

The coffee with Bailey's is wicked good, although expensive ($10)

Reservations recommended for the brunch."}
{"text":"The pastrami hash, duck confeit, masala wrap - all wonderful. Combined with great service. Silverware switchover between courses. White table cloth. Cocktails are not watered down. Oh I forgot, the sticky buns are to die for. Mousse is light and delicious. Love the restaurant. And the owner came by to say hello. A true honor. Great restaurant. Great location, tasteful decor."}
{"text":"Came here for a drink while visiting some friends in Cleveland. We'd planned to go for dinner at a different restaurant, but once I saw the menu at Fire I asked if we could stay and eat there. I had the goat cheese, arugula, and fig pizza and the popcorn ice cream sundae for dessert. Outdoor seating in Shaker Square was awesome for people watching and enjoying the evening. I was impressed at the number of vegetarian options on the menu, I'd like to come back again to try some other entrees that sounded delicious."}
{"text":"As always, Fire was terrific. The food, staff and owner, who truly understands excellence, provided a wonderful experience. He and his team are always welcoming and accommodating. A must stop whenever we are visiting Cleveland...they never miss!"}
{"text":"I went in for dinner at Fire last night and loved the vegan entrée! It's absolutely delicious.  Our server and the hostess could not have been more accommodating and pleasant.  Even our busser was cheerful!  And don't get me started about how great the Fire split is!  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"At first I was a bit worried after looking over the menu, it seemed very pretentious and all I really wanted was something easy. But we were meeting my boyfriends family here for their last night in town and this was what they wanted.

I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good the food was and it wasn't all that pretentious after all. I ordered the wild mushroom agnolotti with green garlic, english peas, cippolini onion and lemon basil. This is a ravioli like pasta stuffed with mushrooms and cheese (ricotta, I think). The serving was quite large and filling. Tons of tasty mushrooms.

My boyfriend ordered the tandoor roasted local pork chop with cheese grits, goat cheese, arugula and strawberry-mustard vinaigrette. When he ordered we were told it was the best item on the menu (according to the server). The chop was extremely large, enough to feed two people in my opinion. He was able to share many bites with me and the others dining with us. It was recommended to order medium and it was cooked perfectly. He absolutely loved it and felt the server was correct in saying it was the best item. I was impartial to my pasta. The cheese grits were really good they came with a few slivers of goat cheese, which we both felt could have used more. 

The only thing I would have to complain about was that by the time the food got to our table a layer of skin had formed over the grits as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long. This was extremely disappointing coming from a restaurant of this caliber (expensive) and should have never been permitted to come to a customers table like that.

A few of the other diners with us also ordered appetizers...the bison meatballs (3 per order) and the claybread (kind of like a flatbread with parmesan, red pepper and garlic aioli). I didn't try the apps but was told that the meatballs were a bit on the dry side and that the bread was pretty good.

We ordered a bottle of wine for the table (Pinot Noir -Ken Wright, Willamette Valley, Oregon 2011). Excellent choice!

Overall the service was great, our server was very attentive and friendly and the food and drink were excellent. I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the film on the grits and the dry meatballs, otherwise a great experience. This place is a bit on the pricey side but we will definitely go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is wonderful. You walk into a hip decor and friendly hostess area. We requested a table by the window and they gave us the nicest one in the house - a really, really nice touch. Service is absolutely impeccable and very friendly. The waiter answers all of our questions, had a great sense of humor, but also kept water and bread/olive oil refilled all night and was able to pace our meal so that we could linger over each dish. The food was great but not outstanding, if such a distinction was possible. Chicken liver and mussels apps were satisfactory, but I have had better fried chicken livers elsewhere that just had more flavor. We had the Caesar salad (Karen's) and the soup du jour - I thought the soup had way too much bean flavor but it had many levels of complexity which made up for that. For mains we had the duck (a classic, but if I'm being honest; somewhat overrated so I don't order that anymore), pork, fish, and burger for myself. The pork and fish were gobbled up and got rave reviews. The burger was great too and a huge kudos to the kitchen for cooking it extra rare for me, but again, I've had more flavorful beef. The mustard aioli was a miss for me - I like my aioli to be on the mayo, not mustard side. There was a really interesting compote or something similar on the burger which made it though. Also, I hate to say that the homemade or artisan bun was the best I ever had, but I much prefer a softer, more brioche-y bun instead. Perhaps this makes me somewhat unrefined. French fries were superb though. After dinner we were too stuffed for desert but did get some coffee which was refilled for free whenever we wanted it. Smiling hostess took our picture on the way out. It's just a very, very fun place and for the outstanding service, hip decor, and far above average food we will definitely be back. Thanks for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here before and had a good experience.  This past visit we took out of town guests out to eat. Food was horrible.  Service was horrible. I wrote a private review to Doug Katz detailing our experience. I never heard back which is making this experience even more annoying. Atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"As a vegan living in Cleveland, I've had many disappointing meals in high-end restaurants in this city. It's as if the top chefs don't believe that vegans like good food. Thank you Chef Doug Katz for understanding that texture, taste and esthetics are important to your vegan clientele. Wonderful food, service, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Had the lemon pancakes, sausage, and home fries. Everything was fantastic. Its not my first time here and I will go back again soon. I would suggest this place to anyone who wants some good food."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly & efficient service. Everything is locally sourced, fresh, and carefully prepared. I was there with several family members and our usual assortment of allergies. We need to ask a lot of questions about ingredients and preparation of the food. Our server was knowledgeable and helpful. Our special orders were beautifully prepared."}
{"text":"One of the places that proves Cleveland has a real food scene.  I am a beer guy so rather than recommend a wine, they sent over their beer buyer who was able to recommend an \"Edmund Fitzgerald\".  It made a perfect match to the steak I had for dinner.

The food, from appetizer to desert was fun, well presented, and delicious."}
{"text":"fire: local, great ambiance, interesting

My boyfriend and I split these two appetizers:

*popovers whipped local honey butter
*\"country fried\" sweetbreads mashed potatoes, braised greens and tomato gravy

*housemade butternut squash cavatelli grass fed beef shank ragout, wild mushrooms and shaved pecorino

*Mexican chocolate bread pudding (with a candle because it was my birthday) :)"}
{"text":"I came here on recommendation from a friend. The presentation of the establishment is very good: clean, professional, nice décor, and at a good location. Their menu is diverse. I am a huge fan of duck and chose the duck confit (again recommended). 

Unfortunately, the duck was VERY sub-par. I have never had such low-quality duck before. It is presented with two wings, the worst part of the bird (we're not having chicken wings here...). It was way overcooked and the skin much too crispy. The accompanying food consisted of spinach and an unknown product (seemed like a mix between potatoes and rice). I've had my share of duck, to include the delicious \"magret de canard\" (the breast meat) dribbled in orange sauce. Why are we getting \"duck wings\" at an \"upscale\" establishment so many people are raving about? 

I am willing to give this place one more try. However, for the price, I expect much better food quality. Perhaps the restaurant should not try so hard to change classic plates to a modern style and taste.

Summary: Nice area/establishment, customer service average, food quality poor."}
{"text":"Lunched here and had a great meal.  Started with the cheese & tomato soup. They start separately and are each so thick that when mixed in your serving cup, they don't actually mix.  It's a neat presentation.  Oh, and outstandingly delicious. 

I also had a blackened chicken wrap.  It's on the menu as the steak wrap, but they swapped the chicken for me based on the recommendation of someone at our table.  It too was outstanding.  It came with a field greens salad that wasn't necessary but was also good with their house dressing.  

None of the four of us had dessert.   

The service was great - highly attentive when needed but not over bearing at all. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best fried rice ever! Everything is good here, and can't remember ever having a bad meal. The service is always top-notch, too."}
{"text":"We always go to Fire at least once each summer to enjoy dinner on the patio and last night was the night. We had a great time as always. 

You can't make a reservation for the patio so you just never know if a table will be available. We got lucky...thank you hostess. They have a wonderful wine list so we started with a delicious Nickel and Nickel wine. Our server, Mark, was fabulous about nicely spacing out everything. Our starters were the heavenly squash blossoms that were probably the best we've had. And, the amazing 18 hour pork which was a party in your mouth. 

I enjoyed the whole fish for my entree and it was wonderful. Unfortunately my husband's pork chop was very well done and needed to be sent back. We never send food back, but it was way too cooked. They graciously brought another which was tasty. 

It was nice to see Chef Katz chatting with everyone- those who he knew and everyone else. He was very concerned about getting the pork chop right. It is so nice to see that level of caring and service. 

We were quite surprised to see the chop removed from the bill. Our server said there was just too much hoopla that he removed it. Unexpected, but certainly nice. 

All in all a delightful evening at Fire. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Food and service were both terrific. Hanger steak was delicious! Jennifer was a fantastic server. 
The chocolate cookies were a nice surprise and tasted great. Coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"ive never actually been here for dinner, so this review is just about their brunch offerings, but when i lived in cleveland, this was one of my favorite brunch spots.

the service is wonderful, the atmostphere casually elegant, and the food...oh, the food...so good.  i can say that i probably had everything on the brunch menu at some point or another, even if just a bite stolen off the plate next to me...and never was i unhappy.  the lemon souffle pancakes are still the best ive ever had (and ive had many a wonderful pancake)...and the chef was kind enough to give me the basic idea behind how they are made (you need to beat your egg whites separately until soft peaks form, then fold them into the pancake batter, a trick i now always use!) though mine never turn out exactly as light and fluffy, these things are superb!  

but for as much as i love the pancakes, i almost always ordered the breakfast pizza, a crispy crust, topped with bacon and gruyere, tomatoes and poached eggs, it was something that almost called to me on sunday mornings.  the steel cut oatmeal was even a treat, here, being served with all kinds of different toppings each in its own little bowl, dried apricots, house made granola...and there was more, i just cant remember now (its been a while since ive dined there!).

if i ever make it back to cleveland, they are on top of my dinner list!"}
{"text":"Best brunch ever.  We tried to breakfast pizza and the cinnamon roll to start.  The pizza is perfect for sharing and so delish - not heavy at all!  The cinna bun is good but not a good choice for sharing between 6 people. It's a single bun!  My friend and I ended up splitting the egg sandwich and the lemon blueberry pancakes.  Egg sandwich naan bread was good, otherwise nothing out of the ordinary.  The pancakes, however, are just out of this world!!! So light and slightly fried or something... absolutely delicious!!!! everyone was happy, lots of options which was great. We all got \"man-mosas\" which is we just ordered draft beers and OJ & mixed ourselves.  Waiter was nice too.  I will definitely return and do highly recommend reservations!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about the place. We went there for dinner twice and the food was ...ehh. The green beans were over done. We went a 2nd time with the same problems...food being just mediocre. Sad. It's right around  the corner from our place."}
{"text":"Great Food...Wow a must try is the Pork Chop which to me is second to none...Great atmosphere and service..our server Christine was very attentive and recommended our dinner experience as well as our dessert.. Popcorn ice cream..... The only complaint I have is we sat at the table in front at the restaurant by the window and the heater is under table which there should be NO table there...overall a great experience and a must try.!! Def be back..."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!!  First off, Lemon soufflé pancakes! And then, in house made breakfast sausage! It just doesn't get any better. We came for Sunday brunch, yes we had a wait, the place was slammed, but it was so worth it! We will be coming back, soon!"}
{"text":"Went as part of the independent restaurant week.  Ordered the 3-course price fix for $30.  I quickly devoured the local beet salad (which I thought was too chilled), the steak and eggs (tandoor hangar steak with english muffin and poached egg), and cinnamon ice cream with chocolate sauce.  The food was good to very good.  I thought the service was just okay which was a bummer.  The bathrooms are uber cool.  Would I go back?  Eh, maybe.  I am such a fan of Flying Fig in Ohio City and I think the Fig has it all over Fire.  Plus, I live downtown, and it's much closer to go to the Fig.  So, in other words, Fire would have to be outstanding for me to make the trek to Shaker Heights and it doesn't fit into the outstanding category for me."}
{"text":"Exquisite brunch options and a lovely fine dining experience in the heart of Shaker Heights!
From the moment you walk into Fire for a weekend brunch, it's a white-tablecloth-view-meets-fresh-bread-aroma type of place. I came here with 3 friends to try out the infamous sticky bun and to explore the brunch entrees (see pictures of duck confit, Fire Benedict, and pastrami hash). We were not disappointed, to say the least! Food was absolutely delicious and the perfect proportion to avoid post-brunch food coma. Service was excellent and our waitress was super knowledgeable about the menu and very interactive with our table. Cleanliness of the restaurant is 5/5. In terms of brunch, the atmosphere is perfect for family get-togethers, dates with your significant other, or even some fancy roommate bonding when the refrigerator is empty. Will be returning to try out the dinner experience at Fire, and looking forward to seeing what this fantastic restaurant has to offer!"}
{"text":"The food was meh. The ono  -- recommended by the server -- was bad. The manager was rude. The wait staff was pleasant enough, besides the bad recommendation. And the salad -- the mushroom salad -- was different from anything I've ever had and quite good. All the salads looked beautiful. The bread was cold. I'd give 3 stars, but only once have i dealt witb such a rude manager. Coincidentally, in cleveland."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch last Sunday. I had the Crocque Madame, which was pretty darn good. My parents had the eggs Benedict. They loved it. The place was packed. You definitely need to have a reservation for brunch. We didn't, so we sat at the bar. The staff was incredibly friendly. The executive chef even came out and treated us. He even refilled my Diet Coke for me. Very nice guy. I would definitely like to go again, maybe for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"If I could give it more stars I would. Lemon soufflé pancakes haunt my dreams. My dad ordered fried chicken livers and thoroughly enjoyed those golden nuggets. Sticky buns were on point and great for sharing. Monte Cristo was well executed and did not disappoint. The French toast was a little overly sweet for some of us. We will find reasons to make the trek into Shaker to brunch here often."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Sunday. Ended up sitting at the bar as we got there at 11ish and were told that they had reservations for two booked til 1:30. The bar was a good atmosphere but the service was awful. There was only one person tending to a packed bar and mixing drinks at the same time. The bartender needed more help and it really hurt the experience. Drinks were not refilled and then we ended up waiting for a half hour to pay after the check was received. So when you sit at the bar be prepared for subpar service.

The food was pretty good. The homemade sausage, fruit smoothie, and sticky buns were all good. My gf got the almond stuffed French toast which was really good. I ended up getting the breakfast pizza which was a little underwhelming. It had a ton of cheese which really overpowered what little other toppings there were. 

I assume this was just a one off bad experience so I will be going back again but making a reservation next time."}
{"text":"Updating my review after another recent visit. The service was pretty on top of things, we even had two waiters come to take our drink orders within a couple of minutes after sitting down. This was a much different experience than last time. The almond stuffed french toast was delicious and we had no problems with our orders.  I always appreciate the free valet here as well."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  Always fantastic in every way! Always enjoy the vegan options"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend for brunch - we didn't realize you can make reservations directly through their website so when we arrived on a Sunday at prime brunch time, we were told there was a 2 hour wait. Luckily seats opened up at the bar so we sat there instead! I sent my bloody mary back because it tasted like cocktail sauce (reason for 4 stars instead of 5), but the bartender was understanding and quickly let me switch it out for a bellini. The Fire Benedict and egg sandwich were both great. We wish we would have saved room for the housemade sticky buns - would definitely split them as a starter next time!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood fine dining.  Wonderful romantic location.  Great staff.  Delicious food.  What more can I say - it's a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning. I was a little overwhelmed by the menu since so many things looked good. What I really loved was the service here. Our waitress was very helpful for making my brunch decision easy.

I wanted pancakes, duck, but also that rice that seemed pretty interesting. I was not about to order 3 entrees though. I'm trying to lose weight for a wedding so I could only do two entrees max. What was I to do?

Our waitress let us know that you could get the pancakes as a side. Also one pro tip is you can add a side of duck confit leg to anything for 11 bucks. 

I quickly made the only correct decision and ordered myself a side of lemon soufflé pancakes and the rice entree with a duck addition. 

The pancakes came out first. They were moist and fluffy and deserving of the soufflé moniker. I really enjoyed how the blueberry component was not too sweet or tart. Usually it's kinda overpowering in some way. The combo was very well balanced. I loved the  texture and flavor of this dish so much. 

I was overjoyed when my vegan rice came with the duck. (I fixed the vegan component) The duck confit was really really good. Super savory, a lot of crispy skin. Love it. I think it helped having the duck with the rice. I liked the idea of the rice a lot, but personally found it to be under seasoned. I think a little more coconut and cumin would have really brought it up for me. Thankfully I had some dank duck to liven up the dish. 

Also all the food here looks pretty too, just FYI. 

This is a great spot for brunch in most cities. Considering it's in Cleveland, I think it far exceeds the average."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch here is great. Yesterday, I had the lemon souffle pancakes with blueberry compote, and the housemade sausage. Excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat, not only for the food but because it is run by some really nice people.  We had brunch here today, but have had dinner here many times in the past.  It's a little bit pricey, but the menu selections definitely justify.

For brunch today we had the eggs benedict and the egg sandwich.  The benedict were cooked perfectly and the sauce was spot on.  My egg sandwich has redefined what I consider a good egg sandwich.  It was wrapped in what they call \"clay\" bread which is like a more firm flatbread and had eggs, bacon, cheese, lettuce and tomato.  There was some radicchio in there which added a really nice bitterness and the fresh tomato really elevated the whole experience.  I tried the house made sausage as well which tasted like it had Indian spice in there somewhere.  The bellini my wife had was great and my bloody Mary was spicy and delicious.  The pickle was a nice addition which I will continue moving forward.

For dinner sample from any of the flatbreads  or other options- just about anything that you try will be outstanding.  We were here a couple years ago for a special dining event where they were serving goat and it was absolutely fantastic.  Any special events that are thrown here should be a must-go evening."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. Weekend brunch. What a great find! While visiting my mom we had a chance to get breakfast together. 

My waitress, Amelia, was informative, funny and eager to help! She shared a suggestion, \"everything is great\". 

The frittata was my choice along with a side of Lemon soufflé pancakes!! I'm getting the full order next time. I also enjoyed the Filbert. Everyday should start with this adult French press coffee. 

This is a great place for families and would like to get a chance to enjoy the night life here."}
{"text":"Our party of 6 was received cordially and on time.
Our waitress came to take our drink orders returned with our drinks. One of the wines was \"on the edge\" but quickly replaced.
From that point the waitress disappeared for a long time. 
Our food arrived and was excellent in all cases. 
Our checks were delivered and we had to ask for coffee.
At this price point $$$, the service should be impeccable."}
{"text":"Their brunch is to die for!! We had the breakfast pizza, almond French toast, and egg sandwich. The ambiance was great - I loveeeee their brunch! It's a must try for anyone living in CLE"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch. We sat outside, which is a nice option in the summertime months. Our server was knowledgeable and made great recommendations. The house made sticky bun is delicious and the definition of a guilty pleasure. The pastrami hash was unique. It was a bit on the greasy side for my taste, but the bf loved it. Man food for sure. 

Overall, we had heard great things about Fire for brunch and it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Contemporary comfort food served in a beautiful space.  Attentive and personal service.  Not a place for intimate conversation but a great place to go with another couple.  Lovely patio in a classic setting."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! Amazing food and drinks! Best manhattan I've ever had and great local and fresh food. We love the cozy atmosphere! Favorite restaurant in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Just because a restaurant is expensive doesn't mean it's good, and this place proves it! I got a steak- about a quarter of it was inedible because it was just gristle and fat. My companion got the cod, which was bland. 

Towards the end of our meal some guy- maybe the chef?- came out to greet a couple of people sitting near us, then whisked them off to another table in a quiet corner. Guess I'm not important enough to get that kind of treatment."}
{"text":"Everytime someone makes a comment that Cleveland lacks good food, I find it hard not to laugh in their face. 

Fire is a prime example. 

I scour Yelp for dinner reviews so before I go somewhere I know pretty well what we should expect. However, my friend picked this place last minute for her dinner meal so I had no idea what it was. Wow, was I happy we went here. The atmosphere is excellent, casual mixed with upscale dinner that draws a large range of people. 

We had a mix of everything at our table. I had the pork chop, my fiance the duck, also a steak was ordered and the chicken. Everyone was absolutely raving about their food which made the price totally worth it. 

The portions here are huge and we all had a hard time finishing. The pork chop was seriously out of this world! 

Definitely splurge and go, it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"This is the best brunch in Cleveland. I had the croque Madame, delicious. My friend had an amazing steel cut oatmeal brûlée. Another friend had stuffed Apple French toast with toasted almonds. Each meal was about $10-15, amazing for the quality. The bloody Mary's were delicious but quite spicy"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Great ambiance. To start I had the chicken livers with the house made bacon which was fantastic. My entrée was the duck confit and it was excellent. I also sampled some other dishes at the table which were the cheese pizza, great crust, the bison meatballs are to die for. I love that you can see the full line of the kitchen. Great restaurant. Great whisky list. Would recommend."}
{"text":"First,  get a reservation for the weekend brunch.  We lucked out with a spot at the bar.  The 2 bartenders/ servers were extremely nice and helpful. 

I got a coffee and hubby got water, but they misunderstood him and gave him a coffee too. Ok, a little annoying but not too bad. The coffee was good, so whatever.

We got a sticky bun, the croque madam, and breakfast pizza. THAT STICKY BUN IS AWESOME. I've made tons of sticky buns in the life, and I approve that message. Our food comes out and hubby hoovers the croque. He even ate some of the salad that comes with it. My pizza was not up to my par. (go look at the photos others had posted... I wish I had seen them) First, there are 2 eggs sunny side up on the pizza, which is in 4 slices. So 2 slices get no egg. Second- sunny side up eggs on pizza? Whaaaaa? Then there's some bacon and a couple pieces of potato (like 6) and a CRAPTON of cheese. Most bites are going to only be cheese and that's it. I like my breakfast pizzas to have a little bit of everything in almost every bite. There's no cheese sauce, at least that I can tell. I like cheese, but this was drowning in cheese oil on the top. Eww This was not a $13 breakfast pizza. I was going to just not eat it, but apparently it looked like I would cry any second and the waiter noticed and offered to get me something else. HE FUCKING NOTICED MY SAD FACE AND DIDN'T LET ME STAY SAD! This is awesome. Normally, waiters don't give a fuck if you hate your food. 

I got the steel cut oatmeal brûlée and hubby got another sticky bun. That brûlée was pretty damn good. I'd definitely order it again. Having the vanilla whipped cream on top and letting it melt in was just heavenly. 

We'd definitely go back again and try other things- after looking at all the photos!"}
{"text":"I have heard plenty of hype around Fire, but every time I am interested in brunch, I'm usually not interested in looking my best, with a trendy scarf and well done hair, and have subsequently always passed.

But this Saturday we were at the tail end of the farmer's market, and my husband suggested at least stopping in for some coffee at the bar. We were former regulars at Katz's Diner on Lee Rd, and they always had the most amazing coffee (which is a Katz custom blend from Rising Star Coffee Roasters). I agreed, despite my jeans and puffy vest attire.

We opted to sit at the bar, which is our usual M.O., and I didn't feel too under-dressed or unwelcome. The bartender was extremely nice and helpful, and we got a pair of hot, steaming coffees and settled in for the full spread, since we were both starving. 

Although everything on the menu looked amazing, my stomach wanted something on the simple side. I went for the eggs and potatoes, but not before asking the bartender about how it came. I was concerned that $10 is a lot of pay for just eggs and potatoes (no meat, no toast, no fruit, no salad), but I was pleasantly surprised. Server said 3 eggs, but its more like 4 eggs, and light, fluffy, perfectly done (attributable to the butter I'm sure). Potatoes were also fabulous, and I got a side of house made breakfast sausage. The sausage was a little dense for my liking, but the flavor was outstanding. Husband got the chicken livers dish (totally not my thing), and he said they were the best he'd ever had. 

I can't wait to bring my friends from Columbus here on their next visit!"}
{"text":"Just fabulous, totally enjoyed the whole experience last night, food, decor and service second to none.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The Lemon Soufflé pancakes my fav. Made with ricotta . Very light. Served with a blueberry sauce. 
Carly our server is always wonderful too."}
{"text":"The sinks are ok hanger steak is amazing. I like the Mack and cheese. Jennifer was nice she gave us chocolate chip cookies"}
{"text":"We were pleased to find that a restaurant we frequented before we became vegan had several appetizers and a vegan specific entree (a rice bowl with cashew labneh). The Indian chickpea fritters with green bean and red onion pickle and almond milk-based cumin cabbage slaw with a side of warm olives and homemade dill pickles were delicious. The entree was delicious as well...green rice, roasted beets, baby carrots and onions and the labneh came with crushed hazelnuts. We finished it off with a cardamom mango pate with caramalized grapefruit sorbet  and pomegranate syrup. A delightful experience all the way around. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. The Pizza with Gruyere and Mushrooms is awesome and that is just for starters (ok you can share it with the table). The Vegetarian options have been consistently delicious and watching my wife eat the Tandoor Rib Eye sourced locally from Miller's Farm I am often jealous.

The atmosphere is casual for fine dining. Like Phil Collins said, \"No Jackets Required.\" The servers are friendly and unpretentious, the wine list has improved over the last year and the environment is comfortable. It is typical expensive for Cleveland, but I eat a lot and have been known to drink my fair share of wine. Free Valet the last year has made going to Fire easy.

People love Sunday Brunch and I can tell you why. The food is light, flavorful and delicious. I find myself ordering the pesto pasta with a side of potatoes. Why? Because I ama Carboholic and the pasta is delicious (McKenzie Goat Cheese Bombs help). 

My favorite meal of the year is the Indian Dinner. The restaurant opens on a Monday night and a feast is served family style. A locally raised goat is used several different ways, each more tender than the next. The sauces vary from spicy to sweet, but they are all bound by an elegance you wish all Indian Restaurants had. Fire is not an Indian Restaurant, but for one night a year I feel like I am eating in the finest restaurant in India. 

Always end with a sweet, save room for dessert. The desserts at Fire are some of the best in Cleveland. Sometimes we skip dessert and head over to Fire to finish on a high note. They have been serving delicious cookies with the bill for the last year. These cookies are small scrumptious bites, good enough to stand on their own. 
See you at Fire!

{"text":"Overpriced, small potions, Loud atmosphere.. food not that good.."}
{"text":"Ok...... This place rocks. Late in the evening, we sat at bar near the kitchen and were impressed. Chefs were a pleasure to talk to and were proud and willing to share their secrets. The chilled grilled vegetable soup was excellent. We were a bit hesitant to order as it was a bit unfamiliar but we were glad we did. Looking forward to trying it at home from the recipe we got. The steak was amazing. Grilled over fire. Duh. With an amazing smoke and first bite that just totally got you ATTENTION. the seafood chowder was excellent. Nice portions. Outstanding service. Great wine selection. Definitely a must go back. Oh. And at the end as we were finishing up the whole kitchen was CLEANED -COMPLETELY. kudos to the pride and caring of the team.  Congratualtuons!"}
{"text":"I went for brunch on Sunday. Even though we didn't have a reservation they were able to get us a table. Plenty of room at the bar for walk ins. I had the mimosa, eggs Benedict and a side of their Yukon gold home fries. Everything was good. Not my favorite eggs Benedict. Needed some more salt and a little thin but still good. Their duck confit brunch dish is one of my favorites. We had great service like always. The owner was making rounds to tables which was nice. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I've lived near Shaker Square for more than 2 years and I've never made my way over to Fire. I came here with my parents for Sunday brunch (to celebrate my birthday). This review is going to include my parents' opinion too! :P

\"Speechless\" - Dad, as he had his Fire Benedict
\"Yum!\" - Mom, as she had her Crispy Chicken Livers
\" \" - Me. I just wanted to finish my vegetable frittata


My mom had loose leaf chai, which she enjoyed. My hot chocolate was very rich and tasty.  We started off with the clay oven bread with cinnamon - a nice start to the meal. I think my favorite was the crispy chicken livers - great mix of flavors (savory and sweet) and very crave-worthy for a breakfast. Delicious! My vegetable frittata included fresh vegetables (eggplant) and was served along with greens. I appreciated the use of local & fresh ingredients, but wasn't necessarily blown away. My dad's fire benedict was pretty ok. 

We enjoyed the decor - very simple, modern. The service was great - complimentary valet (on Sun at least) and the waiter gave us some helpful suggestions for our meal. Unfortunately, we miscalculated the tip and it ended up being a little skimpy. Sorry David! Your service was great."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner here and was pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh, simple and delicious. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully prepared food, romantic atmosphere, outdoor dining and Helpful staff. I called to change our reservation time due to getting last minute tickets for the theater.  everyone took it in stride!  We had a delightful evening."}
{"text":"The perfect brunch spot. Lovely patio. Very friendly service. Decent prices. Lemon souffle pancakes are stunning - flavor and texture. Sticky buns were equally remarkable - the subtle yet glorious caramel sauce combined with the soft yet slightly crunchy bun was delightful. An A+ for both dishes. Superb!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous decor -- but uninspired food calls Fire's purported identity into question.

I'll say up front, I look forward to giving Fire another -- and the third -- chance to properly cook my meat order. I have always seen (and written favorably on) the good and the unique flare of our city's wonderful independents. For now, however, I regretfully write this review based on my latest dining experience.

Indeed, the decor is chic, if not Village-esque. (I couldn't help but feel a connection to Mario Batali's Babbo in the Village, but oh, what a strikingly unfair subconscious expectation that set up....) The service was also fine, though our waiter had no understanding of which alcohol brands were available for order. The menu *looked* right -- the choices were finely crafted and the food descriptions inspired thoughts of delicious, creative cuisine.

However. Yet again, the meat at Fire was improperly cooked. All of it. My pork chop was dry. (Surprisingly, my poor side dishes -- the cheddar grits and the greens -- we're also cooked to the point of inedible filmy/flakiness.) My one friend's hamburger was red, despite a medium-well request. My second friend? The toughest walleye you've never had, and hopefully never will have. 

Grade: C-. Overall, for the price, the chic, upscale, hip identity Fire purports, and for the dishes that Fire attempts to deliver, I could never ever recommend this over the well-executed creations of Symon, Bruell, Sawyer, Crop, and so many other Cleveland A-Listers.

...Yet every restaurant deserves a third chance."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a sunday. Boy the place was packed! Seated at the bar. Yummy bloody maries. food was delicious. highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I lived in Cleveland Heights for a year before moving back to Minneapolis. This place was a favorite for lunches, dinners, and an occasional brunch. Now that I've moved back to the area, I'm in Chippewa Lake, which is a few miles South of Medina. So Fire now falls into my new category: \"restaurants that are worth quite a bit of a drive\"(in their case, about 45 minutes). This really works as I can come up on Saturday AM, go to the Shaker Farmers Market, do some shopping at \"Elegant Extras\" and have lunch or dinner at Fire. The mussels are the best I've ever had, and even something as ordinary as a Hamburger is a delight, especially with the best fries I've ever had!! The pork chop is huge and Doug Katz, (owner/chef), has a great touch with chicken and fish as well as exceptional steaks.
The menu changes so there is always something new to try and the service is attentive and friendly. One of my only complaints is really not their fault: sitting by the huge windows looking out on Shaker Square in the winter can get a bit drafty. My other complaint is nothing about the food or table service: the hosts, male and female seem to be pretty full of themselves and are not welcoming. Tip to both of you: being friendly works.
Good tip: eat at the bar after a movie at the Square. They have special events and their New Years seating is a great way to say goodbye to the year!!"}
{"text":"The best Sunday Brunch in town!

THE UP-SIDE:  Sunday Brunch - the only time I've been lucky enough to eat here so far - is phenomenal!  The selection is out of this world and each item was really delicious.  Try the lemon souffle pancakes with blueberry compote ($10) and the hand-prepared sausage ($4).  Yum.  Our group of 14 reserved the back room just off the main dining area.  It was just private enough to provide a cozy and very satisfying experience.

THE DOWN-SIDE:  It's a little pricey.  Brunch for two came to about $40.  However, it was superior to any brunch I've ever eaten.

THE SUM-IT-UP:  Go here for some amazing food in a clean, hip atmosphere.  The Sunday Brunch is simply perfect.  None of our 14 people were disappointed, and neither will you be."}
{"text":"We went to Fire for a friend's birthday brunch and I have to say, I was very pleased.  We sat on the patio, and it was the perfect Spring day for it.  We also went on a Saturday around noon, and it wasn't too crowded.  Our waiter was fantastic and very attentive.  The food is good, very solid.  In terms of portions size, I think they are just right.  I think too many people are used to the Friday's treatment anymore of a ten pound plate.  My husband had the french toast and a side of bacon and he was full and pleased.  Between the food and mimosas, our bill wasn't terrible.  All in all, I would go back, it was a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"If I could have picked up the bowl and drank the liquid left from the Pei Mussels appetizer, I would have. It was absolutely incredible! They came in a big bowl with about 20 mussels and a large toasted piece of bread. But the real star, was the broth! Seriously. It was delicious. 

I also really enjoyed the warm Chai Bourbon cocktail. After coming in from the cold, it was the perfect way to warm up my stomach for food. It also wasn't too \"alcoholy\" or overwhelming. 

For the main course I had the Crispy Duck Confit. The duck was good. The crispy skin was the best part. It said it came with mushrooms and spaetzle, but if it did it was almost nonexistent. Same for the promised red wine jus. The dish definitely could have used some kind of sauce. Actually if I could have saved some of the juice from the earlier mussels dish that would have been perfect!

The atmosphere of this place was really lovely. Classy and intimate, yet not intimidating. The windows are also a really nice way of enjoying Shaker Square. Parking is a nightmare though."}
{"text":"This place at Shaker Square is THE place for Sunday brunch in Cleveland. I can't imagine there being a better place in the city. It's so good, you don't even realize you're in Cleveland!
Six of us went for the Sunday brunch and the ambiance, service and food presentation were all excellent. Some of the best items were the French toast, home made sausage, and lemon souffle pancake.
It is not that expensive considering the quality, and they have free valet parking, to boot. A very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch options.  French, Asian, and American influences. Trendy spot in shaker square.  Head chef comes to each table to say hello. Informed wait staff. Parking is bad, but there is valet on weekends."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food here always tastes amazing. I've had the duck a few times and it's always delicious and this past week I tried the corn beef hash and it was out of this world. Cool atmosphere in a good location and definitely a little more upscale be prepared to spend a little more if you are going in hungry."}
{"text":"Party of 4 on July 26, overall conclusion nothing special. I would give it 3 1/2 stars. We shared 3 appetizers, a cheese board which was quite good with interesting cheeses, nuts, berries and crackers, an arugula and cheese pizza which was ok and stuffed sausage banana pepper with red sauce which was good if you like spice.
The two couples had different salads, the Caesar was quite good with different accompaniments.  The arugula with cheese salad was bland.
Each couple split their own main dish. My wife and I had what I think was described as a \"cowboy steak\" I think it was something akin to a skirt steak or flank steak. It was prepared well from a temperature standpoint but was a little on the tough side and didn't have much flavor.
The other couple had the duck and thought it was good but pretty greasy, 
Deserts were the high point of the evening,
The Fire Split was delicious. Try it you'll like it.
The other desert was carrot cake which was good but not in the same class as the Fire Split.
The service was so so, our server disappeared for long periods of time and we waited about 15 minutes after receiving our check before our server returned to take our credit cards.
I will try some of the other highly rated restaurants in the Cleveland area before I return to Fire."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Fire Food and Drink for Brunch.  I still haven't been there for dinner.  Brunch, on this visit was just as good as the first time.  My teenage daughter and I dined here, after church and before heading to an early afternoon performance at Playhouse Square.  We had a 10:30 reservation, we arrived to a pretty full restaurant and patio.   We were seated immediately and our server approached our table in order to take our beverage order and recite the daily specials.  We ordered the sticky bun to share and I ordered the Fire Benedict and my daughter ordered the breakfast pizza.  As per the Yelp reviews, the sticky bun was AWESOME, warm, fresh and large enough to share.  The entrees arrived shortly thereafter.  The Fire Benedict consisted of a split homemade english muffin layered with ham, topped with 2 perfectly poached eggs and warm cream hollandaise sauce and accompanied by a simply dressed salad of mixed greens.   My daughter had the breakfast pizza, which consisted of a thin, slightly chewy crust, topped with 2 types of cheese, bacon and breakfast potatoes.   This was a great mid-morning meal.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Fire is truly one of the best-kept secrets in Cleveland, When you find a restaurant that has good food, exceptional service, and a commitment to sustainable practices such as from farm to table, it's hard to keep it a secret for long. Chef Doug Katz provides all that and then some. Brunch is one of the best in the city,  Just go. You won't be disappointed. Great place, good people, good food.  Parking is sometimes tough if you don't want to valet, but don't let that stop you."}
{"text":"Ok, I admit I live in San Francisco, but I'm Cleveland born and raised, and by god I can tell a community gem when I see one.  

Or is it, taste one?  

Home for the hols this past weekend, I enjoyed perhaps my best meal at Fire.  Delicious food, warm, relaxing atmosphere.  QT with my mom, great service, no distractions, only embellishments.  

I was *especially* impressed with the reuse holiday decorations (seriously f-ing kudos to you guys) and the \"air blade\" hand washer in the bathroom.  Ok, ok, I'm really into the green...  I swear the food was also terrific!

It's not so much that I'm looking for San Francisco in Cleveland; frankly, Cleveland's got its own style and when SF's dying of thirst Cleveburg will be enjoying a symphony at their world class orchestra.  

Nevertheless, I have eaten at a lot of soul-less restaurants.  At Fire, I felt absolutely soul-filled.  And in true SF fashion, the only way to repay an establishment for a priceless experience is to compose a 5-star yelp. ;)"}
{"text":"Fancy shmancy.  I really liked this restaurant.  I came here with my husband for our first valentine's day . The brunch menu had wonderful options varying from sandwich to pizza and even pancakes and French Toast . Customer service is just as well as the food . The lady who server our table was wonderful and very welcoming.  Great ambiance,  food and place . I'd recommend this place anyone who is living or planning a trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fire was FIRE. We came on a beautiful Summer evening and got to enjoy the outdoor seating, which I loved. The drink menu is great and they had the yummiest brut champagne. I had the caesar salad as an appy and it was a really good one. I am super picky about my caesars. They even serve a little side plate of additions you can put on the salad- very unique!  After reading the reviews, my husband and I both opted for the duck confit. SO PERFECT. The other reviews about it are spot on--tender & juicy. I want it again, soon. We also had a side of fries (yum) and dessert. ALL delicious. 

Our server didn't have much of a personality and at times was borderline rude. My husband had to hunt her down so we could leave because she literally pulled a harry houdini towards the end. But other than that. no complaints."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere.  The brunch is excellent.  The breakfast pizza is all you would want from a brunch menu."}
{"text":"Came for brunch after hearing great reviews online and from friends. Fire did not disappoint, and I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, even though I wouldn't say it's in the top tier of restaurant brunches I've had in Cleveland. The place was absolutely packed, but we found seats at the bar  and the service was really quick and efficient. I tried the croque madame and the pastrami hash, both of which were really good, but I preferred the rich, buttery sandwich. The portions will leave you full and I really enjoyed the open yet inviting atmosphere of this place."}
{"text":"I am so impressed with Chef Doug Katz's fire restaurant. I went on a date for brunch last Saturday and truly enjoyed the experience. The food was great and the service was excellent. I ordered the pastrami hash, which was really good minus the overload of cheese. I avoid dairy when possible so I would've asked the waitress to hold the gruyere had I remembered. But it was easy to pick out the cheese so no biggie. I also ordered extra potatoes for the hash, which were also really good, and a side of the grits, which were divine (i am a big fan of quality grits). At the end of our meal Chef Katz asked us how the food was. I thought that was a nice touch. This place is truly fine dining at an affordable price. Also, I like how Chef Katz recently donated food prepared for the Cavs (that they no longer needed because the Finals ended prematurely...) to the men at 2100 Lakeside."}
{"text":"I have been here sooo many times but I keep forgetting to post a review...Shame shame shame on me!!! Chef Katz deserves his recognition time and time again!

No matter the meal, no matter the dish...your taste buds are in for a real tantalizing treat!  He uses the best ingredients with the most creatively amazing recipes!

Today, for the first time, I tried Brunch.  Sat at the bar with my Bestie and enjoyed the company of so many unique people there for the very same reason... dine exquisitely!

So after I mulled over the menu selection for at least 20 minutes...all sounding so very delish... I decided on the Pastrami Hash...was I in very a very special Hash! Delicately shredded meat and cooked with a bit of crunch...just enough to make it crispy... sitting on top of little potatoes cooked perfectly as well... all of this topped with gooey, rich cheese, a fried egg, a couple slices of tart apple and fresh field greens (because this makes it a healthy meal :~D)...

I wish Yelp had \"scratch and taste\" so you could taste my meal!
OH, and I took home a Sticky Bun... because I feel that the calories do not count if I take it home and enjoy it!!!"}
{"text":"This is a place even a prejudiced NewYawker like me can appreciate: a loft like setting with trendy yet laid back dining room with an open kitchen with a view of the restaurant's shrine to slow cooking: a proper clay oven (tandoor.)  A party of six and EVERYTHING each of us ordered was outstanding: savory scallops, buttery polenta with smoked sausage and shrimps, the absolutely melt in your mouth slow cooked pork chop, Tandoor oven cooked trout, yum yum yum.  Even the chef himself came out and helped me debone my whole fish, because I guess I looked like I needed help (I didnt, I was just less than coordinated after multiple glasses of wine.)  Speaking of which, to a wine snob like me, that's where Fire falls short.  The bottle of Domaine Drouhin Pinot from Oregan (Willamette Valley, in the Burgundian style of the Domaine Drouhin) was served at room temperature, which is a big NO NO.  Cave temperature, like 55 maybe up to 60 degrees, man.  Esp since I was drinking it to go w/ my shrimp n sausage dish.  And then I ordered a bottle of CA chardonnay (Kistler from Sonoma) which I figured was rich and bold enough to stand up to post-Pinot drinking and go w/ my boldly smokey Tandoor cooked trout and my wife's asian style duck, but the wine was served icy cold, right out of the fridge.  This aint no Italian prosecco!  It was way too cold for us to appreciate anything but the alcohol and acid.  These aint no minor mistakes but they are fixable: I had the waiter rest the pinot in an ice-bucket (he looked at me like this Asian boy doesnt know his wine from miller light) and when the Chardonnay came, it stayed OUT of the ice-bucket and I cupped the glass in my hand until it reached proper temperature.  Because the food was so perfect, all this bother w/ wine was worth it.  At least the wine list was reasonably priced and quite well chosen."}
{"text":"Delicious, gourmet, well-executed comfort food.  The relativley small menu changes often, and I've always been pleasantly surprised when dining here.  Usually a great crowd, and the atmosphere is contemporary but cozy.  The kitchen is open to the dining room.  From time to time, I feel like I pay too much for what I get here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Mussels are the thing to eat along with the mushroom and gruyere  pizza here. So glad I found this place. The honey and lavender ice cream was delish but the popcorn ice cream is amazing. Sounds weird but tastes like kettle corn flavored heaven. The ambience and decor reminds me of SF restaurants. I wouldn't bring kids here as its more of an adult vibe. Our waitress said that kids are more welcome on the weekend. Go try it!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Cleveland.  Nothing is less than excellent - drinks, food, and service (whether brunch or dinner) are consistently the best around.  Would return often."}
{"text":"Yum! Cleveland has a much better food scene than most people realize and Fire is a prime example of that. Not only is the restaurant based on sustainable/local principles, but the food is great. The mushroom pizza alone is enough to rank this place 5 stars but I took one star off for the noise level/ambiance (not always enough space in the aisles and my boyfriend got knocked in the head a few times by waiters). 

Also loved my burger. You may judge me for ordering a burger when there are so many more inventive items on the menu, but I am a burger connoisseur  and the waiter couldn't say enough good things about it. He was right, it was amazing. One of the best I've had! And I eat a lot of burgers."}
{"text":"I had duck confit. The meat was fall-off-the bone tender. Skin was crispy and the fat under the skin was perfectly rendered. Done by the book. Perfect. One of the best meals I've ever had.

My dinner date ordered the pork chop. I had a taste of it. It was a thick-cut, had a good char and very tender. It was seasoned in a way that enhanced the sweatness of the pork. Again, a winner.

The server was knowledgeable of the menu, including the source of meats and produce. Apparently, this restaurant goes to great lengths to ensure sustainable sourcing.

This ranks as my top 3 favorite places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant, one of the tops on the east side. Service can be a bit slow when they get crowded, but the food usually worth the wait. Sunday brunch has a nice menu and is a local favorite."}
{"text":"Not my favorite brunch spot. French toast was soggy and filled with a pudding substance and lemon pancakes were too different for my liking."}
{"text":"We went here for a culinary experience and a professional chef was in our party. It was a great atmosphere and the staff was good to us. We must have ordered everything on the menu! We went all out and our chef was recommending things and asking questions we would have never. I honestly can't remember each dish and all the things we enjoyed. What I do recall is the duck. We were skeptical and our chef buddy said that if they can nail a duck dish, they are golden! It was awesome. It was the crispy duck confit. Served with red wine jus and spaetzle. It was perfectly cooked and a great piece of meat. 

The night contained with more great food and drink but that duck was the highlight. The service was ok but nothing great. They were knowledgable about the food but couldn't really talk to much more than what the main ingredients were. Our chef friend was asking very technical questions to be fair. Overall a cool restaurant with interesting dishes and a cool oven."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 stars. Came here for brunch, definitely make a reservation ahead of time - it was packed. We ordered the duck confit and the blueberry lemon compote pancakes. 

Duck confit was solid (4/5). The jam plus smoky flavor of the duck went well together. The pancakes let down the meal (2.5/5). They were just way too sweet - cloying. Would definitely NOT order again. Overall, food was okay, service was good, as was ambience. A solid restaurant. Nothing blew me away, however."}
{"text":"I read a lot about this place before I got here. The First time was for dinner. Great Service and good food. But the second time, for brunch, was a disappointment. My husband ordered the almond french toast which was really nice but a but too sweet. I dont consume eggs and I was unable to order a single thing. Except a plate of fruits. There was one vegan croquette option. That was it. I was quite disappointed. Guess American brunches anywhere cant do without egg."}
{"text":"My first Sunday brunch in Cleveland. Fire's food was tasty, but the service lacked. 

My girlyfriend ordered the lemon pancakes with blueberries (light, so tasty, not too much fruit, pretty perfect). As she made her order, our server casually asked, \"would you like bread, home fries or [something I forget] with that?\" and she answered with \"home fries\". My turn, the beloved eggs benedict. The hollandaise was sort of thick and the Canadian bacon pretty thin, but it was tasty. I asked if it came with anything and he said a light rocket salad so I also ordered the home fries.

The food arrived, we ate and enjoyed. I had to wait (and ask) for my coffee to be refilled and when the bill came, we found that my friend's pancakes didn't, in fact, come with a side. The server asked in such a way which implied that they did, and all she had to do was pick one. For that price point, it was a definite bottom line bump. Sneaky, Fire.

I would like to return for dinner since it gets such high reviews, but based on my first experience it won't be terribly soon."}
{"text":"I'm sad to give this place 3 stars because my food was very good. Our sticky bun appetizer was amazing. It wasn't overly glazed and the dough was warm and cooked perfectly.  I ordered the almond stuffed French toast. It also had sliced almonds on the top and baked apples. My friend who does not like French toast actually said she wished she would've ordered that instead of her lemon pancakes (although she said that was good too).  The French toast wasn't cooked just enough so the edges were crispy but not burnt. They definitely were not stingy with the maple syrup either.  So why the 3 stars?

Our server was very nice, but forgot my friend's tea altogether. My husband's breakfast pizza had eggs that were not cooked thoroughly. Again, we had difficulty finding our server. It seems like he had tables in different sections of the restaurant rather than one area so we barely saw him.  They did make him another breakfast pizza but instead of making it with the eggs cooked in the oven with the rest of the toppings, they fried the egg and put it on top instead. 

The executive chef actually came to our table to greet us which was nice. The ambience of the restaurant is lovely and there is free valet parking. So I will be returning for brunch or maybe even dinner. However, I'm hoping the service will improve a bit before my next visit."}
{"text":"One word: burger 

Yes, I am a huge fan of chef Katz. Though many may perceive the venue as a little upscale, I'm always at home sitting at the bar there. Yes, there are many great things on fire's menus, especially brunch (pastrami hash, lemon souffle pancakes, breakfast pizza are all well above average). Oh and those popovers are not to be missed! 

However, it all comes down to the burger, cooked medium rare. If I had to have a last meal,  this burger would make the shortlist. It's one of the best bites in Cleveland; and as burgers go, it's not just the best in Cleveland or Ohio, but definitely ranks among the best in the nation. The firm bun with the dijon aioli perfectly compliment the meaty beefy juices seeping from the patty. I suggest a side of greens to balance the richness of the burger, but to each his own.

#bestburger"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and thought that the food was good but not great. Maybe its that Fire tries to do too much--offering an extensive menu. These are my takes on the dishes I got:

The breakfast pizza was my least favorite item--it came out kinda cold and the egg on top was overdone and wasn't runny at all. What is the point of having an egg on top of a pizza if it isn't runny!!?!!? just kidding... but seriously.

The duck confit was crispy and was pretty good, if not a little heavy for a brunch item. But hey that was my decision to undertake such a big dish. T

he lemon soufle pancakes, i'd say was probably the most successful dish, it was light and fluffy and not too sweet. 

I suppose the one thing about Fire is that each dish is good, but there wasn't a dish that really stuck with me--that I dream about coming back for another bite."}
{"text":"Fire is a great spot - and though I love it for the evening setting - I must say I love it most for the Brunch. 

My family has recently moved to Cleveland, and our one tradition so far is that we spend each Easter at Fire.  This is year two, and it's one we'll continue.  This morning I had the quiche :)

Very good, every time!"}
{"text":"When my parents visited me from California, I brought them here for Sunday brunch.  The food is very nicely presented with an expert combination of flavors ...portions are not big which I find sometimes makes the food actually better, but I can understand why some people may shy away due to the prices here.

The space is light and open and located in the quaint little neighborhood of Shaker Square."}
{"text":"Best cheese burger...... Just a hint of cumin and a dab of aoli and the right amount of cheese!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years but their breakfast pizza is my favorite things pretty much ever! I've been all over the world and this is the best! I've had other breakfast pizzas and none can compare. I would go to Cleveland just to be able to eat this pizza if the opportunity presents itself. My husband had the burger with a fried egg and loved it. Their hot chocolate is amazing. It's real Chocolate and milk. If you are in the area and can eat a breakfast pizza for me! I know when things are hyped too much you can be disappointed so go with no expectations and hopefully you will love it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Lentil soup special, beet salad, great, followed by fall-off-the-bone duck confit and creme brûlée oatmeal with fruit - outstanding."}
{"text":"Not impressed AT ALL. I wanted to take my wife there for her birthday. I invited some friends to join us - it was a decent sized group. After 40 minutes we still weren't seated and this was a reservation I had made over a week before. When we finally got to our seats our group wasn't seated together. The service was very VERY slow. The food was decent but nothing spectaular - and it is pretty pricey. The wait staff was pretty unfriendly - I would not recommend this place to anyone. Will NOT go back"}
{"text":"This is one of the best brunches I've ever had.

I called ahead about twenty minutes before we headed over for breakfast and a table was waiting for us when we arrived. 

I never saw the bottom of my coffee mug, and the lemon souffle pancakes with blueberry compote were hands-down the best pancakes I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"The service was amazing, the food was amazing.. i mean what else could you want for a nice meal.. I mean super meal ..!!! 

The steak was perfect and so was the pork chop my husband had, The dessert was so amazing and lets take a moment for the staff they are on it!"}
{"text":"High-end food (read: expensive).  
Creative and arty (read:  small portions, stack high so it looks pretty). 
I will admit, my order was tasty. 
I got the pork chop; the meat was a generous cut, very tender, and superbly done. 
I enjoy a balanced meal, and a nutritious set-up.  the corn fritter, brussel sprout, and other accompaniment were nice touches.  
I sat at the bar, and watched a lot of the food come out.  A lot of it looked delicious, but I think I would have still be hungry after the meal."}
{"text":"Brunch heaven! Loved the pulled pork crepes chock full of cheese! Perfectly sweet and savory

Also had some of the sticky bread which wasn't overly sweet.. Just right. I'll be returning soon to try the duck confit, which some of my friends got and loved. Breakfast pizza also looked delicious, so many options for next time!!"}
{"text":"I love their brunch menu! I also love the bread that they give out before we get our foods. It's better to make a reservation because this place is packed on weekends! Definitely try their blueberry lemon pancake if you are indecisive as to what to get for brunch!!"}
{"text":"I came into town and took my brother in law his wife and children out to Fire, heard great things about the restaurant from them. I can tell you that the food was very good, but why i am giving them only three stars is that our server Emily was rather slow and really not attentive to our needs. And while i generally tip according to the service, i had no choice in the matter because Emily gave herself 20% tip on my bill, i am glad she think so highly about her service capability, i however do not and frankly having traveled on business/personal around the world i can assure you i have seen far better service else where. So if you do happen to go to Fire and you want to have an enjoyable evening and you happen to have several people with you, please do not ask for Emily, her self-esteem will cost you. ."}
{"text":"Last week, I went to Fire for brunch to celebrate a friend's birthday with 5 other women. We were seated and served our coffee and water within minutes. From then on...we never saw our waitress again. After 20 minutes we asked Doug Katz, the owner who was standing behind me, if he could get our waitress so that we could order. She returned 5 minutes later. She took our order and one of the women asked for another cup of coffee because her's was cold. Almost 30 minutes later, when our waitress just happen to walk by, we asked when our food would be coming. Within seconds, Doug came to our table and said the following \"We take special care and time in making our food and if you don't like it, then don't come back. You ladies have done nothing but complain so don't come back.\" He repeated that atleast 2 more times and then said \"It's obvious you're not enjoying each other's company or else you wouldn't have noticed that the food was taking so long\". We indicated to him that we were hungry and then he said, \"then you should have eaten before you came here\"!! WE THOUGHT HE WAS KIDDING, BUT HE WASN'T. We were speechless! 
Asking for someone to take our order after 20 minutes, asking for a hot cup of coffee and asking where our food is after 30 minutes is hardly a reason to insult you customers. His behavior was shocking, insulting and extremely unprofessional. For someone who has been in the restaurant business for as long as he has, I would hardly call this a reason to behave like a child. Don't worry Mr. Katz, you don't have to ask us twice. We won't come back. SHAME ON YOU!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate there 11/05/14 for a mini celebration, but,  unfortunately the meal was not an addition to the festivities.  Bland orecchiette pasta. Hangar steak was requested medium...more than half was rare....deep red and cold. 

The only bright spot was our server. She was attentive and enthusiastic.  Don't get the hype and won't return."}
{"text":"The breakfast pizza was really good. Fruit was a bit unripe though."}
{"text":"This is a very belated valentine's day review, but better late than never, right?
Fire is a place I had been to for brunch a few times and loved it, but finally got to try out for dinner this time.  

Overall the experience was really nice.  The service is always excellent, with the chef/owner greeting each table every time I've been there.  That matters, and he clearly knows. The decor and ambiance is warm, lively, and inviting. Its a nice and elegant place that still makes you feel comfortable and at home.

The food was a bit underwhelming though.  I ordered the moroccan hot fish which was good but just good- 3 stars.  It wasn't bursting with flavors and the description was far more interesting than the delivery, unfortunately.  My boyfriend loved his dish, the goat cheese agnolotti with added braised local lamb, which left me with some real food envy after trying a couple bites. 

To me, Fire is a solid and reliable place to take a date, your parents, or friends from out of town.  It didn't blow me away this time around, but its a place you can never really go wrong.

..and if nothing else, you must come for the sticky buns at brunch. I think about them (too) often."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for years, and in spite of the fact I don't live too far away, I have never been there to eat.  Nice location on Shaker Square with free valet parking.  Nice touch, since parking can be an issue.  Trendy ambience, and we were pleased to be seated in a room away from the main dining room.  It was much quieter and more personal.  Interesting menu, with many items based upon locally available produce.  Server was very attentive and helpful.  Good wine list with several interesting features.  Full bar with nice pours.  Nice touch with non alcoholic beverages, serving fresh apple cider spiced with a hint of cinnamon as a seasonal beverage.  Appetizers were very interesting and good.  Mussels were awesome.  Never would have thought that a pizza would make a good app to share.  Had the burrata just to be adventurous.  Simply amazing!  Light and flavorful.  Entree were very good.  Pork chop was well sized and extremely flavorful.  Salmon was cooked well and tasty.  Pasta dish was tasty and well sized.  Two in our party had burgers, which were good sized and tasty.  Save room for dessert.  The popcorn ice cream is to die for.  Light, flavorful and made to share.  Overall this is a great local gem and one of the finest restaurants in the area.  Would highly recommend.  Will try to find a way to make it to their Sunday brunch.  If it is as good as our meal, it will be amazing."}
{"text":"Mushroom pizza is amazing.  Rising star coffee.
I hadn't been here for dinner before only brunch.  But i will be back.  Mushroom arugula salad fantastic.  The pork chop was a generous portion well prepared.  The mushroom pizza is what will keep me coming back, that and the lemon soufflé pancakes."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and stopped by this restaurant b/c it was in walking distance to where I was and had decent yelp reviews; plus the menu had some things I liked.  
Here's the breakdown: 
HOST: He gets a 3.  The restaurant was relatively empty when my guest and I arrived to eat.  I don't particularly like to sit really close to people when I eat, if I don't have to.  So I made a simple joke to him about it, and requested one of the many tables that appeared to have a bit of space between them.  This kid acted like it was the night the POTUS was coming and was taking soooo long to 'figure out' where to seat us.  His first thought was to squeeze us in a table right by the bar, in front of a swinging door that looked like it went to the back or kitchen :( Really guy?  I told him, 'look, I tip very well, we can do better than that, right?  He looked lost.  Until finally I pointed to a table and said, how about that empty one.  He acted like it magically appeared there and then promptly seated us.  
Now on to the good:
AMBIENCE: Nice.  Nice lighting.  Quaint.  Great vibe.  
WAITRESS: (CHRISTINE)  She was fantastic!! Very knowledgeable, personable and was top notch.  Our food was spaced out perfectly, truly.  We had enough time to enjoy each item, let it settle for a bit, and before we could even think to ask about our next item, it was being placed in front of us.  She came to the table just enough, at just the right time; while leaving us alone perfectly at well.  I made sure to give her, I believe a 30 or 35% tip b/c she was that wonderful.  She truly made the experience even better in addition to the food.  THANK YOU CHRISTINE!!
FOOD:  Excellent.  And I'm coming from LA where we have a plethora of options and types of cuisine.  Not one thing we ordered was bad.  
Mussels: 5 stars
We had something I forget the name now, it was shaped like patties, with a slaw (appetizer), with an Indian flair.  5 stars
Caesar Salad: my cousin loved it gave it 4 stars
I believe I had the wedge: 5 stars
Burger: top notch! 5 stars needed nothing added to it.  Was great.  
Salmon: 5 stars
We shared 2 different desserts, one was the banana split/chocolate cake w caramel I believe.  TO DIE FOR.  Great, great, great!  
I was definitely happy and the price for the bill afterward was shockingly low.  Just another sign of how overpriced and ridiculous living in LA is.  The same meal would have cost me at least $250.  And we didn't even drink alcohol.  
Thanks Fire, for an awesome dining experience!"}
{"text":"This place would be a nightmare for a PETA activist.  I counted at least 4 fur coats while dining here.  I felt a little under dressed with my shirt I got for 10 bucks cause there's a rip in it and my 1.99 thriftstore slippers that I try to pass off as shoes.  Oh well.  Not gonna let my low self-esteem stop me from getting an amazing meal.  Went here for Sunday brunch.  This is not a place where Saturday night partiers go to recover from hangovers.  It looked like the afterchurch crowd, or for family get togethers.  
Our server was nice but you could tell he wanted us to order quickly.  I felt like Ralphie in the Christmas Story when Santa keeps asking him what he wants and out of sheer anxiety he settles for tinker toys. Oooewww.  I hear myself yelling out mocha.  I don't drink coffee, let alone mochas.  Shoot.  As soon as I said it I wanted to change my answer but swoosh he was gone.  Oh well.  It actually wasn't too bad.  It wasn't sweet at all which was nice and I rather enjoyed it.  My friend had the fresh squeezed OJ but I didn't really think it tasted fresh squeezed.  We shared the sticky bun and I had the egg sandwich while she had the fire benedict.  The sticky bun was a perfect sharing size and had just the right amount of stickiness, not too sweet.
I loved the egg sandwich and potatoes.  The potatoes were greasy, salty and delicious.  The bacon was thick and crispy.  The clay bread tasted like naan so yup liked that too.  The egg was actually the only part that was just ok.  (I could live my life without ever eating an egg and be perfectly satisfied).  I just started growing my adult tastebuds a few years ago after hating eggs for years but still am not a big fan of them.  However, the server confidently stated it was one of the best on the menu and I pretty much did whatever he said.
My friend loved her fire benedict.  I tried the arugala salad that came with it and it was awesome.  I would definitely come back to try dinner."}
{"text":"Great food, great waiter, terrible hostess. We arrived to an empty restaurant with all open tables and were forced to sit at the worst table in the restaurant, a table in the middle by a pole. I will stress again that every single table in this restaurant was open at this time. When I asked her this table, she said yes. Perhaps they need to work on their hostess to keep up with the superb quality of every bring else, including the service and the food. If you come for anything, make it he sticky buns and lemon soufflé pancakes!"}
{"text":"Amazing!

I'm from Chicago, and we're proud of our restaurant scene here.  Chef Doug has a meisterwerk that would rise to the top in our little ville, too!  

His creations are phenomenal!  Uses locally sourced ingredients, which is really cool, too.  

The duck is out of this world.  Duck is one of the things I really like to order.  Fantastic!

I'm not a dessert person, but I did try a spoonful, and it was amazing.

My wife had the walleye (IIRC), which was also out of this world.

The staff was completely on task - professional, polite, and very friendly.  

The decor is really neat.  They did a good job

Outdoor seating looked good, and the windows give a good view of Shaker square and the streetcars dinging on by.

For Clevelanders - bravo!  This is top shelf dining in ANY city in the world.  If you haven't been, yet, please go! Out of towners: you'll see from this experience that Cleveland does indeed ROCK.

Thank you Chef Doug!"}
{"text":"We had an incredible experience this afternoon during Brunch. It was a little busy but, we were seated right away. Our server was polite and was on top of things. The atmosphere was bright and cheerful. We ordered a Mocha and coffee and that came out quickly. They were both hot and delicious. For our starter, we had the sticky bun. Wow! Seriously, the server said it would make our day and she was right. It was amazing. While we were enjoying it. Chef came out and said I had a look of bliss on my face. He's right, I did. Lol! For our main course. We had the lemon soufflé pancakes and the pastrami hash. The blue berry puree and lemon were a pretty spectacular combination. The hash was sinful, the mix of greens, egg, cheese, hash and sauce plus the apples was quite simply the best combination I've had, hash wise. We also split the Masala fried fish sandwich. Lord! That was a great Sandwich. We also left with a jar of Cats famous pickles. We will most definitely be back. Chef is an evil Genius."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Fire.  The first visit was almost three years ago for dinner and I remember it being pretty good, but don't remember enough details to lump it into this review.  So, instead, I'll focus on the post-Baptism brunch we had there on a recent Sunday morning.  Despite the repeated inability of the hostess to count to 11 (coincidentally, the number of people in our party), we had a pretty good meal.  Their brunch menu was good - full of many enticing options, including a few non-breakfast items like cavatapi pasta.   I had the oatmeal \"brulee\" appetizer, which was a nice size for an app.  By the way, the \"brulee\" is just a fancy way to say \"sugar on top.\"  The oatmeal was good, but the hot chocolate I ordered tasted like Swiss Miss.  The breakfast sausage side I ordered seemed housemade and was good.  Everyone else seemed pleased with their selections as well.  I'd go back to Fire for brunch and for dinner too, maybe even just to remember why I liked it the first time."}
{"text":"I went to Fire for brunch and I thought the food was just OK. Definitely good, but I don't think I would go again. I am vegetarian, so my choices were limited and what was there was not too unique or flavorful. I had the vegetarian frittata and it was tasty, but I believe I could have made something equally good at home. I also ordered a side of toast and jam and I have to say, the jam was incredible. By far, the best part of my fire experience. It was a tomato jam that was unique, unusual, and well worth the money!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Fire, I finally got the chance to go for Restaurant Week.  I ordered off the special Restaurant Week menu (3 courses for $33), and was unfortunately very disappointed.  For the first course, you could pick from a green salad or lobster bisque.  I opted for the lobster bisque and it was pretty downright awful and most of my fellow diners at the table felt the same way.  I did not find a single piece of lobster in the soup.  In addition, it tasted like butternut squash soup which is not anywhere the neighborhood of lobster bisque.  The bread at the table was cold, though the olive oil was delicious.  Some of the bread had such huge bubbles in it that some pieces were literally just a piece of crust.  For the entrée, I ordered the hanger steak.  The other option was a vegan stuffed eggplant.  My steak was full of fat and gristle.  I was only able to chew about 50-60% of it.  It was served with a patty-like creation of sweet potatoes.  The potatoes were pretty tasty but somehow in the process of turning it into a patty, got pretty burnt on one side.  It also came with kale.  I will eat almost anything but this kale, oh this kale.  Bad.  It tasted like it had been soaked in a bottle of vinegar and was nothing other than bitter.  There was a little bit of sweet relish over the steak which was overall pretty tasty.  The best part of the meal was dessert.  They had two options, apple crisp and banana split.  I ordered the banana split which included a piece of banana coated in a thin layer of crunchy caramel, salted caramel ice cream and a ganache brownie.  It was very delicious and ended the meal on a high note for sure.

The service was excellent throughout the meal.  For my fellow diners who ordered wine, the server was very thoughtful with her suggestions.  She was very quick to fill up my non-alcoholic beverage when it was running low as well.  The restaurant is very open inside and has a nice ambiance, not too loud but not stuffy feeling either.

Overall, I'm glad I finally got to check out what everyone was talking about, but I won't be headed back for sure."}
{"text":"We went today for Sunday brunch - delicious!!!!!!  
We sat outside - lovely environment.
Our waitress was kind, very attentive, and provided GREAT service!
The food was AMAZING!  We highly recommend the sticky buns, the seasonal soup was curry eggplant w dates (yummy) and the entrees that we recommend are the BBQ pork crepes and shrimp fried rice. We highly recommend the Sunday brunch!!!!"}
{"text":"I was back in Cleveland and felt compelled to update this review.  I brought my girlfriend with me from Jacksonville for a long weekend at some of Greater Cleveland's best establishments.  Museum of Art, Indians Game, Rock Hall, Chinato, Tango Room, Red, 2AM Guy's Pizza... we covered the bases.

For Sunday Brunch, I chose Fire.  Mainly because we were already going to be in the Heights area.  It was a tough call... I generally prefer Nighttown.  Roll of the dice basically.

So glad I chose Fire.  I had the Croque Madame, which was one of the greatest things I have ever eaten in my life.  Without a doubt, if someone asked me what the best thing I've ever eaten was, I'd have a hard time deciding, but this would be on a list of 3-4 things I'd consider.

Don't try to make this at home.  I am an excellent cook and will try just about anything, but I know not to try to duplicate this.  Because everything was perfect, and most components of this dish were simply things I wouldn't want to try to perfect.

The bread was the perfect texture, and was cooked perfectly.  Almost charred on the very edges, fully cooked and sealed off on all surfaces so as to not get soggy, but soft, chewy, and delightful inside.

Fire's house-made ham was a perfect complement to the gruyere, which, with a touch of dijon mustard, made for a great hot sandwich.

Then, this was all covered in creamed leeks, which, I'm telling you right now, were amazing.  My girlfriend described them as \"leek chowder\" (she's from New England, so this makes sense).  Now, we have taken a perfect sandwich and then launched it into the stratosphere.

Only one thing left to do . . . put a perfectly fried, farm fresh egg on top.  Because it's been a long time since I've done the Meg Ryan fake orgasm thing at a nice restaurant, and frankly, I was due.

Lucky for me, they put a little pile of arugula and pickled red onions next to the tower of awesome so I could occasionally reset my palate and be blown away several more times.

Also, awesome service, excellent French Press coffee (the Guatemala variety), and assorted Champagne cocktails.  An entirely different experience than when I was last here a couple of years ago.  I'm so happy to report this."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that the food at Fire was 4 - 4.5 stars.  But, I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars because of our server's terrible communication skills.  

First, I worked as a server for many years, so, I'm not super duper hard to please.  I just like my water glass filled and appreciate good communication.  But alack, and alas, while my water glass was well-filled during my meal at Fire, the communication left much to be desired.

We arrived a few weeks ago for a Sunday brunch.  We were seated and promptly greeted by our server.  While perusing the menu, we asked the server about his favorite menu items and also asked about the breakfast and mushroom pizzas.  He responded by highlighting some of his favorites (e.g. the pork crepes) and then also said that he would \"never order something so pedestrian as a breakfast pizza when going out to brunch.\"  I was a little flabbergasted; it would have been one thing if I wouldn't have mentioned that I was interested in the breakfast pizza, but quite another thing when some rudely tells you that your choice is \"pedestrian.\"

I decided to let it go.  Next, when our server came back to take our order, I asked if I could add an egg to the mushroom pizza.  Without even hesitating, the server said if he could bring the egg on the side.  I said no, because the whole point of a breakfast-ey type of pizza is to have the runny egg cooked ON the pizza.  Plus, Fire appears to have a breakfast pizza anyways.  Consequently, it didn't appear to be a big deal to modify the mushroom pizza in this way.  However, the server said that the \"chef would be super mad\" if he ordered it that way.  I just stared at him.   A few moments of uncomfortable staring later, he said that he would go ask the chef and see if that would be ok.  Unfortunately, he never came back to advise me about what the chef had said.

When our entrees came out, our food looked delicious, but the egg was definitely not cooked on the pizza.  It appeared to have been poached separately and then placed on top of the pizza prior to being served.  Needless to say, I was annoyed.  The server could have let me know earlier that cooking the mushroom pizza with an egg would've been a problem; I would've gladly changed my order to the more \"pedestrian\" breakfast pizza.  

Nevertheless, my friend and I were starving and we devoured the delicious food; no complaints there.  I honestly should've spoken to the manager before I left, but it was a busy Sunday brunch and I was already in a bad mood, so I let it go.

However, I do think that if Fire is a \"white linen\" type of place, guests should be accommodated.  At the very least, if no accommodation is available, it should be clearly explained to the guests."}
{"text":"If you're looking for amazing, you'll find it here. In need of a nice Saturday morning brunch place around Shaker Square that took reservations, we didn't have many options...and that's how we landed here. 

We sat on the patio, which was an enjoyable atmosphere with good people watching. Immediately, two house sticky buns were ordered for the table to share. O.M.G.  (a much more appropriate \"o\" word to say than the alternative). Heaven in your mouth is all I can say. Worth every bite and every single calorie consumed. I may not be able to share next time!

I tried a little of everything at the table- which may have been half the menu. Here's a short breakdown:

Lemon soufflé pancakes- light and fluffy, perfectly paired with a blueberry compote. Excellent.
Vegetable frittata- very good, full of lots of veggies (mostly spinach if I remember correctly)
Crispy duck confit- not oily like I expected, but rich (as duck is). \"One of the best cooked ducks,\" coming from the table's duck connoisseur. The grits and side salad were both pretty yummy, too.
BBQ beef crepes- hands down my favorite. Also pretty rich, but oh so good. Aaaand I even ate some of the beans. This is a big deal people. I don't touch beans. Ever.
Croque Madame- maybe my least favorite of everything. Not because it wasn't good, it was. There was something that threw me off a little, and I'm thinking it was the creamed leeks. Regardless, it was devoured by the person that ordered it.
Almond stuffed French toast- wish I could have gotten my hands on more than one bite. If you like marzipan or almond extract this one's for you. 

This quaint restaurant surely proved my doubts wrong! Easily my favorite breakfast in Cleveland...for now!"}
{"text":"I have ventured to Fire, Food and Drink three times now-(My big sis lives in Cleveland Heights) and have loved every visit. The attention to detail is fantastic. The atmosphere is clean and modern. The exposed heat ducts are a nice touch. The open kitchen affords each guest the opportunity to see all the action.  The wine list always has some hidden gems- and the bar carries Hangar One Vodka (Yes I am biased since I work at the Hangar!) Our server was fun and friendly. Fire is delightfully one of the Cleveland Originals!!! Support your locally owned and operated restaurants.
 I look forward to visiting often and enjoying a cocktail or two!

Update- 2008 March. Just visited the Fire for the 4th time. It has become one of the many things I look forward to when I visit good ol' Cleveland Ohio. I ordered the Barrimundi for my main and the Aged Gouda and fried sage flat/bread as a starter. Service here is always great. I will be more than happy to visit again when I come back in November."}
{"text":"One of the great places in NE Ohio. My go to restaurant when out of town guests visit or special occasions, but also for brunch. For me the pork chop is one of the finest plates in Cleveland. I also recommend the PEI mussels and the burger. Everything I've eaten on the brunch menu is fantastic, especially the fish sandwich. Great beer and wine selection and an excellent Manhattan. Can't go wrong. Expect at least $50 per person with drinks. Free valet."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, and it was pretty good! The decor was pretty awesome, and service was quite good despite the crowd. Clay-oven bread with cinnamon sugar was a guilty pleasure. I wasn't as impressed with the pastrami hash, it was just a bit more greasy and salty than I like (if I order it again, I'll ask for a poached egg instead of fried, I think that would be a better contrast). I just had a taste of the burger, but it was excellent.

So while I wasn't quite rocketed to \"best ever\", I do want to go back. I need to try the lemon pancakes, and I have yet to check out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Finally got here with our family for brunch. While everything was very good the Hash was outstanding as were the lemon pancakes. 
Valet parking, great service and will be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Nice place in Shaker Square.  Brunch menu had a variety of offerings.  It was kind of difficult to decide on just one thing, however I was pleased with my selection: Duck Confit w/ Grits.  The dish had a lot of different things going on, but the flavors all came together and complimented each other....who knew blackberry preserves would go so well with pickled onions, grits, eggs, and duck? The Breakfast Pizza was pretty good too.  The crust was cooked perfectly (I believe it was baked in a brick oven?) Perfect for a hangover...if you have one.
Fire definitely intrigued me enough to want to come back for dinner"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by Fire. Took a lyft here for dinner on a Saturday night. Had a good cocktail and a glass of wine. We shared a \"pick 3\" cheese board; there were some tasty and interesting offerings to choose from. I decided on the pork chop for dinner which was very good, thick cut, cooked very well, surprisingly not dry at all in the middle. He had the whole branzino which was a little fishy for me (i know, it's weird criticizing a fish for being \"fishy\") but he really enjoyed it. We'll be back here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Fire for brunch, dinner, a drink, whatever. The food is nice (great to split) and the bar is fantastic. It's a fairly lively crowd and everyone I've interacted with his jovial.  They had a great kale salad (hard to do), but it's off the menu now.  I'd also recommend not going for the pizza, there are much better options!"}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland from out of town, and decided to dine here based on positive reviews.  The menu looked nice, and the atmosphere was comfortable.  The staff was nice, but not overly friendly.  Service was good, but at times lacking for this price point.  Now, let's get to the food.  This is after all the reason to dine out.  Let me first say that I am a private chef, so I understand my standards might be higher than the average guest.  Regardless, execution on the plate is vital when charging premium prices.  My wife and I decided to share each course, which turned out to be a good idea.  Even sharing an appetizer, salad, and entree....and sharing two glasses of wine....our bill was around $100

The first thing we ate was the cheese plate with a glass of Riesling.  One of the cheeses on the plate was off...off in a bad way.  Also, no one came to explain which cheeses were what...we were left to decide on our own.  Of course we knew what cheese was what, but with four different cheeses on a plate, someone should explain what they are and where they are from.  The best part of the cheese plate were the 3 blackberries that were there.  After that we shared a beet and chickpea salad.  The salad was underseasoned, boring, and lacking flavor.  The other problem with the salad was the type of greens used.  I believe it was Romaine or something simple like green leaf.  At this type of restaurant I would expect Mache, Baby Greens, or some interesting type of green.  I felt the salad could have been better with more acidity, more tender greens, and possibly some shaved fennel.  The main course was duck confit on a spaetzle with sauteed spinach.  The spinach was good, but the spaetzle was almost inedible due to over salting.  The duck was very dry, and I cannot understand how a duck confit can come out dry?  The skin on the duck was by far the best part, but the dish was not successful because of execution mistakes.

I don't think the restaurant is terrible, but certainly nothing special.  If you are prepared to charge these prices you need to execute better and wow me with some great cooking - otherwise I would rather have a sandwich at home."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, cheese board  is a little pricey, but the chicken thigh  was local, fresh and top notch. Great date location."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a few weekends ago and had a wonderful meal. Our server was Amelia, she was wonderful, attentive and very funny. We started off we the sticky buns as appetizer. If you come here for brunch I highly suggest getting them. The menu has a lot of options and everything looked so good. Since I already had the sticky bun I decided not to get anything sweet and went with the egg sandwich it was delicious. The next time I come back I plan on getting the vanilla mascarpone french toast. They also have a wonderful selection of drinks from boozy brunch cocktails, coffee and an assortment of teas. I loved the vibe of the restaurant and plan to come back for brunch and would love to try dinner here."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends here last night for the first time.  We have been for brunch several times before (get the lemon ricotta pancakes!), but never for dinner.  Glad we did.  We started with some Indian fritters and mussels, both of which were fantastic.  I had a vegan dish for my entree which wasn't that good, but I wasn't expecting much.  My husband had the pan seared tile fish which was outstanding.  Our friends ordered the trout and the chicken.  They seemed pleased.  We had their homemade sorbets for dessert.  One was grapefruit and the other was coconut.  The coconut was so good that I asked if they would sell me a pint.  They did not.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and new, which was very surprising.  The atmosphere is great.  Overall, a fantastic experience and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Went on for a Sunday brunch. I tried I call ahead but they said they were fill until 1pm but patio is first come first served. I got there at around 10:20 (opens at 10) and this patio is already full. When we went in, they were still able to seat us. 
I ordered a crispy duck confit and the bf had a lemon soufflé pancake with sausage. It was awesome.  My duck was crispy and delicious, a little bit on the salty side but good in general. The lemon soufflé pancake is absolutely amazing. Delicious lemon taste and was not too sweet and pancake is perfect amount of crisp. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Fire had excellent service, delicious and beautifully plated food and a lovely ambiance. Everything we had was excellent.  I would absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Perfect way for us to wrap up a visit to my home town...made me proud."}
{"text":"We went for a special occasion Sunday brunch since Fire was highly recommended. The sticky buns were amazing, but the Hollandaise had way too much lemon and was very sharp. The service was generally okay, although waiters did brush our heads with trays more than once in the too-narrow aisles. The atmosphere was attractive and clean, but the noise level made it a little hard to have a conversation. If I'm in the area, I might stop again, but I won't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"I expected to love Fire but my experience really was just ok.  I mean, the service was good, and my Dark and Stormy drink was good, but for the price point, I expected mind blowing, out of this world food and service.  The service was really good except for our server scolding me when I accidentally reached for the bread plate he'd brought for dipping oil.  My bad, guy.  No need to make me feel dumb about it.

There was nothing wrong with my meal or my boyfriend's meal - I had the winter vegan special which consisted of tofu, small pancakes, and a smattering of vegetables.  Although I'm a vegetarian, I eat plenty of vegan food, and really expected this dish to be better.  I don't normally care about price, but $23 for a vegan entree?  C'mon, man.  Has the bad economy hurt the price of tofu in Cleveland?

My boyfriend had clam pasta.  It didn't seem all that special to me.  And he said it was good, but not something he'd make an effort to get again.

Overall, this was a kind of disappointing experience.  I'd been looking forward to a fancy date night with my boyfriend but what I got was what seemed like an overpriced, average meal."}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to try this amazing restaurant a couple of weeks ago and all I can say I was very impressed from beginning to end. 

As soon as I pulled up I took advantage of the valet parking which. The young men were polite and friendly. We where fortunate enough to be seated in the small room towards the right rear which only contained 3 couples when we walked in. I liked that because it made it more personal and out of the way from the main dinning area. I told the waiter (Chris if I can remember) that this was my first visit to Fire and also I was from out of town. Chris was very helpful and he actually sat down while he explained the menu to us. I like it when a waiter/waitress takes the time to actually sit down and talk to you about your meal especially when it's your first visit. 

We started with the crispy chicken livers sautéed spinach, house made bacon and dried cherry compote. I'll have to say that I thought my grandmother who was born and raised in Georgia in the 1920's could make some good fried chicken livers back in the day was good but these would give hers a run for her money in a sophisticated sort of way. Don't be afraid to try them, I promise you'll like them.

I originally viewed Rachel Ray on the Foodnetwork a few years ago dine at Fire and she was impressed with the Tantandoor new creations pork chop, split pea hash, sweet pepper coulis and pickled ramp slaw so I've always said that was the entrée I was going to try and I'll tell you right now God as my witness that was the best pork chop I've ever had in my life. I wanted to suck the bone when I was finished. 

Since it was our first visit Chris rewarded us with desert on the house of his choice. He brought us popcorn ice cream sundae caramel sauce and candied pecans. All I can say is OMG! OH MY GOD! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE TRY THIS. I almost started crying when I finished!

Overall I was very impressed with Fire Food & Drink and when I'm back in the Cleveland area I will be dinning there again."}
{"text":"Big fan of this in Cleveland.

We went with about 18 people from work.  Spent some time in the bar and had a room in back.  This was some dynamite food!

Sample of pizza and stuffed peppers for appetizers.  We have a running search for the best stuffed hot pepper.  Mafioso's, Delmonico's, - nope.  The best stuffed pepper was here.  He cooks where less equals more.  the individual flavors come through.  Pepper is just spicy enough, the stuffing was light and fluffy, not dense, the sauce was simple and not leftover marinara.  Wow that was good.

Had a steak with a port demi glaze, yep, that was awful good also.    Really this was a great treat.  I would put this alongside anything I have eaten in Cleveland.  An absolute must try."}
{"text":"The food is superb - only the highest-quality, freshest stuff available. Doug does a great job incorporating as much locally-sourced and seasonally-available food into the menu as possible. I've never had a bad meal here -

Definitely splurge on the Fire Split for dessert!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Fire better than I thought I would. It was a friend's birthday choice, but some lousy recent reviews made me skeptical that we would get overpriced, heavy food with mediocre service. In fact, the service was five-star - a welcoming and well-informed waitress more interested in making sure we had a great meal than in the up-sell. 

The spaetzel was the standout side I tried, and was light, crispy, chewy, and buttery.  The delicious pork chop was perfectly seasoned amd cooked, and would have fed two.  The sauteed spinach/kale mix was too salty.  Mac and cheese was plain enough for our group's picky eater and interesting enough foor the rest of us.

It was still a relatively pricey meal with too-big portions, but the flavors and service exceeded expectations and left us warm and fuzzy. Don't miss out on the seasonal cocktails, either!"}
{"text":"Have been many times for brunch and dinner. Brunch is definitely my favorite. This visit I ordered the shrimp fried rice which they I guess ran out of shrimp so they offered chicken instead. Absolutely everything you would want out of a fried rice. 
My friend got the beef crepes. A must have if you come for brunch served in a hot dish and baked to perfection and topped with a fried egg and a side of black beans. You will not be disappointed. 
The service is always excellent as well as their knowledge of everything on the menu. 
I have gotten traditional breakfast here as well. My top must haves are the cinnamon rolls (good to share) oatmeal, clay bread egg Sammy and croque Madame. 
They also have a great drink and coffee menu. Never been disappointed here, great for families too!"}
{"text":"The best brunch in Cleveland, hands down. Consistently excellent, with a menu that is sophisticated yet approachable at the same time. The flavors are wonderful, and there is something for everyone on the menu. I also feel full-but-not-stuffed after eating here, a definite testament to how well-balanced the food is.

Everything is amazing here, but a few standouts to recommend - the oatmeal (seriously amazing), sticky buns, confit duck and the eggs benedict. The pancakes and stuffed french toast are also incredible.

Beautiful restaurant, beautiful and delicious food. Definitely recommend 100%."}
{"text":"My only complaint is how busy they are. We came for brunch on Sunday. We arrived at about 1145... They told us they didn't have an open seat till 1:45... For future reference make a reservation.. We did however grab 2 seats at the bar and enjoyed our meal. I had the duck confit... The duck was great and the poached egg was perfect. I wish it had come with potatoes but next time i will order them... I also had the breakfast sausage which was homemade and very flavorful. My wife had the lemon pancakes. They were fluffy and lemony and the only complaint was the blueberry complaint was just ok... We will be back for brunch with reservations this time.. May also try dinner soon, will update if we do!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week.  The portions for restaurant week, I have noticed, are smaller than the portions you would get for a regular entree, since some of my friends got normal entrees and glancing at their meals, theirs were probably 2 times bigger.  I had the halibut, which tasted OK, but was a very tiny piece of fish surrounded by some lukewarm parsnip puree and caesar salad.  Considering that I just ate a different salad as part of the three course meal, I'm not sure why I would need more?  The sauce that came with the meal was firmly congealed to the plate, and I wouldn't really call it a sauce, more like a sticky mass that you can't really eat with the fish, for it's even hard to scrape it off with a fork.  I also tried some pork chop.  The meat was tender and was flavorful, but the outside was entirely coated with cancerous char.

Would I eat here again?  Well, I'm not so sure.  We got here at 5:30 on a Sunday night and service was pretty slow.  And, for some reason they were pouring the olive oil out on plates for bread for a completely empty table that wouldn't have people seated on it until an hour later, yet we weren't even offered olive oil/bread yet.  The entrees I tried weren't really ones that would entice me to go here again.  I do like the notion of a restaurant that relies on sustainable methods for their ingredients, but I wasn't really wowed by the food itself, especially at the prices they charge normally."}
{"text":"I've been to Fire Food and Drink twice for brunch and once for dinner. This review is based on the collective experience of all my visits, but it will focus on the dinner service in the food section. Reservations are recommended especially for weekend dinner. 

Overall: highly recommended 

Service: Highly attentive staff. Servers periodically check-in with you while bussers waltz around the restaurant clearing empty dishes and refilling glasses. This is a place where your water glass never gets a chance to be empty. In fact, the one time I was close to finishing my drink the owner, Doug Katz, calmly stepped in and refilled my glass. During both brunch visits, Mr. Katz was at the restaurant greeting guests, asking about the food and service, and assisting the bus staff. I found his presence to bring a warmness and confidence to the restaurant. Wait staff was very helpful with dietary restrictions, taking the menu back to the chef to confirm potential allergens. Servers were able to make food and drink recommendations based on specific individual tastes within my party.

Ambience: upscale bistro elegance - white tablecloth, candles, black chairs, exposed brick with white wood trim. Upon walking into Fire you will see a hostess table in front of you. There is a small bar area to the right and a dining area to the left. Open kitchen that you can view from your dining room seat. The dining room can be a bit loud during brunch and dinner, but never too loud that it distracts from the experience. Outdoor seating is also available in the summer.   

Product: I started dinner with the House Manhattan which is rye based. The \"house\" twists were the substitution of orange bitters for Angostura, and the addition of Amaro Averna (an Italian digestif) which add bitterness and body to the drink. The table shared a clay bread, fried pickles, and a meat & cheese board to start the evening. The clay bread is a flat bread similar to Naan in thickness and chew. Our server mentioned that the dough included yogurt. The fried pickles came with a cool, creamy Russian dressing sauce which was the perfect accompaniment to the warm, salty pickles. We selected a sheep cheese with peppercorns and two types of ham for the meat & cheese board. The hams came from a local butcher shop in Geneva, OH. We originally only ordered the pickles and flat bread for six of us, but the waitress suggested adding another starter. She was spot on with her recommendation. I had a 2-inch thick, bone-in pork chop from New Creation Farm as my entrée. The pork was cooked in a tandoor which produced a crispy exterior with a melt-in-your-mouth juicy center. Per the recommendation of the staff, my pork was cooked medium. The pork chop came with spring pea succotash, bacon lardons, and jus. The lardons and jus were both rich, and they brought salty, smoky flavors to the meat. The succotash was bright and fresh which helped to cut the richness of the rest of the dish. Texturally, the crispy lardons and snappy succotash were very welcome additions. I finished the meal with house made ice cream (goat cheese flavored) and a cup of espresso. I would consider ordering everything I tried again during my next visit, but the pork chop entrée was something special."}
{"text":"This is how meat was meant to be cooked!  Appetizers were light and flavorful. The meatballs have a nice herby flavor with a tang from the goat cheese. The real prize was the tandoori cooked ribeye. Perfectly seasoned, fat rendered to a crispness on the outside and melted in your mouth. However the pork chop my wife had was not far behind it. It was at least two inches thick, moist and with a saltiness to it. The parsnips and frizzy with it could be a meal itself. Great service from the greater to the complimentary valet. Our waitress clearly had tried everything on the menu and was very helpful picking the right courses and wine!"}
{"text":"I had heard this was a great brunch place, and I'm glad to report it does live up to its hype! My friend and I arrived around 12:15 pm on a Sunday and were told that without reservations, it would probably be 1:30 or so before we'd be seated. We chose to sit at the bar instead (which is first come, first serve) so if you don't have reservations and don't want to wait too long for a table, I recommend you consider sitting at the bar! It was little crowded but we didn't have to wait at all, and you can order from the full brunch menu from there :)

I ended up ordering the croque madame and a peach bellini. Honestly, there were so many entrees on the menu I wanted to try, I feel like I have to come back to try some of the other items! The croque madame turned out to be flavorful and very satisfying. My friend ordered the egg sandwich and a tea cocktail, which reminds me that Fire also has some really unique cocktails on their brunch menu which are worth checking out!

I have no complaints about the service here - our server was friendly, and our food came out quickly. Fire also has really cute decorations set up outside their restaurant (not sure if this is a winter seasonal thing), but it's a nice touch haha. Overall, my friend and I agree that this is a brunch place worth coming back to!"}
{"text":"I've eaten dinner here three times.  Each was incredible.  The soups are awesome, the pizza appetizer was extremely flavorful and each entree has been perfectly prepared.

Fire is big on flavor.  There isn't much here that will disappoint.

Who knew?  Apparently everyone.  The last two times I tried to eat here I couldn't get a seat.  Oh well... I'm glad high quality is being rewarded with success."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch here on Sunday at the recommendation of a friend who lives in Cleveland. The dark chocolate latte and vanilla latte were both amazing...and so beautiful! My husband got the Eggs Benedict, I got the vegetable frittata and we split a bowl of breakfast potatoes (Yukon Gold fries). The chef (and owner?) even stopped by our table to see how we liked everything. He popped out several times to chat with patrons; very nice to see. We sat inside because the weather was a little chilly yesterday however several patrons sat on the beautiful patio. We will absolutely be back to Fire!!!!"}
{"text":"Among the best restaurants in town, no doubt about it. They have a tandoor and use it to good effect for what you might expect (delicious flatbreads) and what you might not (meats). Speaking of meats, there's a refreshing level of attention here to the provenance of the beef, lamb and pork on the menu -- where it's from and how it was raised -- which I know I'm looking for more and more when I go out to eat (especially at the higher end). The dinner menu usually features two or three fish entrees as well. And I second the earlier reviewer's comments on Sunday brunch -- possibly the best upscale brunch in town. Try the lemon souffle pancakes or breakfast pizza (tandoor-made). The oatmeal comes with several cute little spoons for toppings, a presentation repeated with the caesar salad at dinnertime."}
{"text":"De-freakin-lightful. 

Yes, Fire was en fuego! My family and I dined here a few weeks back and enjoyed quite a variety of dishes. We enjoyed the patio, so I can't speak much to the interior - but it looked lovely from the window. Simple and clean. The service was great - a bit formal at times, but efficient and friendly, nonetheless. 

With a party of six, I was able to taste quite a few menu items...

Cheese Bouratta: 4/5: Melty cheese on bread and crackers. Need I say more?! 

Popovers: 5/5: They ran out of bread during our visit. Yes, ran out of bread. Odd as it was, they kindly offered our tables some popovers on the house and I was over the moon about them. Light, fluffy with a hint o'buttery flavor - spread on some of that local honey butter and these little nuggets of carb didn't have a chance. Gone. 

Claybread: 4/5: Very flavorful with a nice texture. It was a baby pizza in the making. 

Squash blossoms: 4/5: I love the idea of squash blossoms and while these were tasty, the actual blossoms could have used a brighter punch of flavor. I loved the boursin cheese addition, though. 

Crispy duck confit: 4/5: I rarely (read: never) order duck because I fear for its greasy factor. However, this duck was crispy, well prepared and delicious with the side of spaetzle. Some of the leg meat was a bit on the oily side, but the flavor was fantastic. 

Strawberry rhubarb crisp: 5/5: Who knew I even liked rhubarb?! This crisp was just about perfect. And the Greek yogurt topped it off beautifully.

Truffle brownie sundae with espresso ice cream: 4/5: The brownie sundae was also a delight. The only other thing I can recall about the sundae was that the espresso ice cream was a bit strong and overpowered the flaky brownie. 

So, hell yeah I enjoyed Fire. It was a really great meal with outstanding company."}
{"text":"I was pretty bummed about this place.  They claim a vegan entree but were all out. The waitress seemed overwhelmed and not very excited about being my server.  The food was just ok (I wound up with potatoes and avocado). The manager was nice so I'm giving 2 stars for him.  The rest of the staff was incredibly rude though. I won't come back, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Just the best place you can go!  We had a table of 18 and could not have enjoyed it more.  Usually a big table is a nightmare and we were prepared for that, but Fire made it so nice for us - amazing service and fabulous food!  Will go again any and every time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Fire.  After seeing the restaurant featured on several Cleveland area articles, we decided to try it out.  Walking in on Saturday evening around 9pm, we were surprised to find the restaurant mostly empty - it must be more popular during earlier hours.  The restaurant features a nice main dining room facing the kitchen, bar area, and outdoor seating.  Overall very nice environment and interior.  

Upon being seated we were promptly greeted by our waitress.  There were service service related issues during the start of the meal.  (1) Firstly, and above all the waitress had a very cold and impatient demeanor which was noted by all guests.  We asked several times that we would like take our order but was told to hold on, this occurred 3-4 times between placing our appetizer order and placing our main order.  This is a first for me.  Overall we got the feeling we were being a nuisance.  (2) bread came significantly after the appetizers were finished.  Bread should have been served before or shortly after appetizers had arrived.  (3) significant time between noting a cocktail was empty and asking if another drink was required.  

In terms of the cocktails, I ordered the sangria and manhattan.  The sangria was way too sweet and for 10 dollars way too small.  I do not recommend the sangria unless you are looking something super sweet.  Manhattan was well done.

For appetizers, we ordered the mussels and decided to share a pizza.  The mussels were cooked well and the accompanying sauce was very good.  The pizza was average with the crust a bit thicker than expected.

We ordered a mix of main entrees between the table to share - the tandoori pork chops, rainbow trout, duck, and the hamburger.  The sides we ordered were French fries, scallop potatoes, and green beens.  The tandoori pork chops was the best by far - i would recommend topping it with the fried egg as it really added to the flavor.  Hamburger was average as the amount of meat was overwhelming compared to the bread and toppings.  Sides were pretty good and would recommend the green beans.

For the price point, the environment and food was on point, however, the service was severely lacking.  The restaurant needs to reevaluate the service level during evening hours.  The automatic tip percentage does not warrant bad service.  Once we left we understood why this place may be so empty on a Saturday night.  Hope this is just a case of a bad waiter versus a wider issue."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed 2 trips to Fire, both on more professional work-related dinners.  Highly recommended, solid eatery.  4 vs. 5 stars only because, while the food was excellent, it was expensive.
--parking: free valet - yes please!
--staff: professional and friendly, nothing legendary, and just a tad on the slow side.  On both occasions, Chef Katz personally welcomed us at the table.  
--ambiance: very pretty, more upscale vibe but jeans are totally acceptable (don't need to dress up)
--food: AWESOME!  High quality meat plate offerings and excellent vegetarian options, each time there were 2 entrees offered.  My favorite on this trip was a chilled beet soup.  Mmmm!  Make sure to order a side with your meat entree, otherwise you might still be hungry."}
{"text":"Most of the 5 star reviews here are for brunch.  After our dinner last night, that makes sense. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't awful. Just really was not 30 bucks a plate good. 

The atmosphere was nice. Not too dark, and they actually had the sense to put some sound-absorbing material on the high ceilings. Most places don't do this and it gets WAY too loud so I appreciated that.  I did find it a bit weird that they're trying to have a real upscale type of place, but the waiters are still really casual and wearing jeans. But on to the food....

Went with my husband and a friend of ours. They both got the shortrib. I was going to go for the trout but in the end, the grass-fed burger just sounded awesome and I couldn't pass it up. Well......I should have gone with the trout I think. 

For me, a burger has to have good flavor ON ITS OWN before you add toppings. This was not really the case here. It was just ok. It was an extremely thick patty too and I couldn't really even taste the toppings because there was just so much meat in each bite. It wasn't balanced enough. It was also overcooked. No pink - completely well done which is not how I ordered it. So it was kind of dry and bland for me. The 'bun' was a bit different too. Very thin and crispy with a bunch of fennel cooked into the top. It wasn't really bad it just really didn't work with the extremely thick, overdone meat. If I cooked this in my backyard, it would have been good. But it wasn't close to good enough to be 21 dollars. 

The shortrib was tender and did have a decent amount of flavor. The desserts we tried were also good but not great. The sticky toffee pudding cake Sean ordered wasn't really sticky or toffee. It reminded me of a muffin - it had that texture.

Aside from my burger, I can't really put my finger on it but I just wasn't that impressed with this place. When the bill comes to more than 120 dollars, It's nice to look at the check and think 'ah who cares, it was frickin' AMAZING!' I just didn't get that feeling. I might go back and try the brunch because both on Yelp and from friends, I've heard good things. Probably not for dinner again unless it's somebody else's idea."}
{"text":"Great brunch place! I tried the Indian style Masala Fish Sandwich, it had great flavor, and I really liked the spices. The fries were also great, crispy and seasoned well. Also tried the sticky buns as dessert, it was very good, definitely recommend! The only downside is they only had one vegan option, which was a bit limiting for my friend following a vegan diet."}
{"text":"Take this review with a grain of well, fiber. As a recently committed vegetarian this was my first foray into the wild outside the confines of my own safe plant strong fridge. A social dinner with friends to test my resolve.

Glancing thru the menu Fire Food and Drink gets brownie points for supporting local farmers and organic produce. Even offering a single vegan main entree. Which i decided to try. 

Unfortunately it was quite the forgettable, overpriced dish. Mixture/confection of quinoa carrots spinach and a vegan egg substitute on top? It was bland and tasteless. And I was so ready to fall in love with this restaurant. Great open kitchen vibe and their suggested hibernation draft brew was just the right mixture of grainy maltiness and tipsy smile producing headiness. Noticed the detail from the starting bread filler with EVOO dip. Nice crisp fresh baked bread with a unique apple cripsness to the EVOO sauce i had never had before. It was quite unfortunate that the main entree failed me so spectacularly. 

My friends speak highly of this restaurant. So who knows, maybe i'll give it another chance and devour one of their fish dishes next time i'm back.

But in the mean time. Strict vegans. Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came to Fire with my dad and sister to have a birthday brunch with my dad. I found Fire through Yelp and decided to make a reservation for Sunday at 10:00 am. I definitely recommend making a reservation because by the time we left they were PACKED! 

This was a delicious dining experience!

To start, we ordered the homemade sticky buns and they were absolutely amazing!! I don't usually like sticky buns, but these had a caramel sauce that was perfect. Our waitress also recommended ordering the lemon souffle pancakes (blueberry compote and whipped butter) to share and I'm so happy we listened to her suggestion! These pancakes were just the right amount of sweetness with an amazing blueberry sauce. 

My sister ordered the almond stuffed french toast (rittman orchard apples, toasted almonds and local maple syrup), my dad ordered the bbq pork crepes (housemade crepes, cilantro crema, local egg and black bean stew), and I ordered the crispy duck confit (southern stone ground grits, poached local egg, jam and arugula). Every single dish was AH-MAZE-ING!! This restaurant has definitely learned how to load the menu up with a diverse selection of brunch items. There are just enough savory dishes and sweet dishes to balance each other. 

If you are looking for a great brunch in a cute restaurant, go to Fire! Their menu items are so unique and the flavors were perfect!"}
{"text":"A gem located in Shaker Square.  It had been a couple of years since I had been there. Complimentary valet parking is available, otherwise there is ample street parking. We were seated in the patio on a beautiful summer night. Our server was fabulous and her recommendations were spot on. 


I ordered the Tandoori Ribeye - Medium-rare was just awesome and I loved it. It was an intriguing combo of Tandoor cooking and a steak, a genius idea as far as I am concerned. I would go back again just for the rib eye. Other entree I tried was Peruvian Chicken Thighs - was pretty darn good. 

A + experience. A must go if you are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Everyone was very pleased with their meal at our brunch at Fire. We ordered the eggs Benedict, the oatmeal, which had delicious caramelized bananas, and the simple egg and potatoes dish...eggs any way that you like, with crisp home style potatoes. We did have to order a side of toast. The meal was good, the service was not so much. Our server was really too slow. He took 20 minutes to come take our order, another 20 minutes to bring coffee... another 10 to bring us our bill after clearing our plates. All this and since we just caught the end of the brunch service, the restaurant was empty. (One tip: If you go late in the day and you want something specific, like the house made sticky buns, be sure to ask them to put it aside for you.  They may or they may not do it.  However they will definately be out of the byns by the time that you get there.  In our case they were out of the buns and also the sausages.)  All in all, we missed out on a few menu items and not that we were in a rush, but the service was far too slow and inefficient."}
{"text":"This place is great. This is my favorite place to go for brunch. I recommend the tandoor smoked pastrami hash and get a sticky bun too."}
{"text":"BRUNCH REVIEW FROM 2/24/18 experience: Lovely restaurant, they accepted our 11am reservation we put in earlier that morning, our waitress Amelia was extremely friendly and very attentive to us. Additionally she was really good about recommendations and really showed us she knew the menu and could provide recommendations based on what she liked and what we expressed we were looking to have. I appreciated that they made it so easy for my friend and I to split a meal (delicious French toast). The dark chocolate mocha latter was AMAZING! Only thing that could have made the brunch experience a 5 Star would be if they offered breakfast meat that wasn't pork. Great brunch spot and I looked forward to returning to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the salmon here. My husband got the duck and didn't really like it but it was probably a personal preference thing. It was a pretty good experience overall. The service was quick, maybe even a little too quick, and this was on a Saturday night. The parking was pretty convenient as well as we parked right out front."}
{"text":"Good food but slightly over priced. We've eaten here several times for brunch and once for dinner. Brunch is 50 / 50 if the plate will be great or average. Dinner plates were all great, but I've eaten at better restaurants in Chicago that are cheaper overall."}
{"text":"Had brunch here this morning and it didn't disappoint. The service was great and the tandoor smoked pastrami hash was worth coming back for. I can still taste it in my mind later in the day."}
{"text":"Brunch was decent. Sat outside on the patio on one of the last nice fall weekends.

Lemon Souffle Pancakes (with Blueberry Compote) were good - fluffy, flavorful & filling. 

Fire Benedict was good, rich and full of texture (followed the waiter's recommendation).

Sticky bun was good - fresh and just sweet enough with coffee (which could have been refilled more often).

Service was sub par in our experience...given the price tag of the meal and the stature of the joint....left a lot to be desired (pleasant enough but slow or less than attentive to our entire section.)

Total bill $50 + tip. Not sure if we'll go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Attentive staff.  Interesting atmosphere.  Noisy.  Simple presentation with fresh local ingredients.  Overpriced menu.  I'd go back but some other day."}
{"text":"Usually happy here.  Not this time.  The fried rice entree was dry and not edible.  The side of mac and cheese at $9 was also much less than adequate.
Stouffers frozen is way better.
Nice server, but a desert is not compensation for food that could not be eaten.
Getting lazy?"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried out Fire this morning for brunch after hearing it was pretty good. We had a 10am reservation and when we got there people were already quickly filing in. We tried the almond French toast topped with strawberries and the breakfast pizza. Both were delicious. The breakfast pizza had cheese, potatoes, bacon and 2 sunny side up eggs. It was delicious and had good flavor, but was a bit greasy. The French toast filling had a strong almond flavor. On top it had sliced almonds, sliced strawberries and maple syrup. We enjoyed both very much. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our meal was very good except for the curry vege meal. We had to send that back but they were nice and replaced it. The pizza was great as well as the steak. Really nice modern space, a little loud."}
{"text":"I came to Cleveland for an interview and decided to check out a nice restaurant while I was there.  The obvious choice would have been to go to Lola but I decided to go to Fire instead after hearing good things about it.

The decor was pretty trendy and nice.  The food was a little disappointing however.  While the meal started off on a high note with the popovers, the entrees seemed a little inconsistent.  For example, one of my dining companions and I ordered the same entree.  However, mine was extremely salty whereas hers was well-seasoned (we tasted both).  While mistakes do occur, I feel that its unacceptable for a pricey, fine-dining restaurant to make a mistake like that."}
{"text":"Duck confit for brunch was to die for. Absolutely stunning! As you bite, u hear a crunch thru the crispy skin, with a rush of moist juice n rich flavor. Then spooon the grits with runny yolk, flying thru the creamy dreamy richness. Finally fork the greens w pickled veggies in grape jamm, refreshing acid to pull u out of the dream, but the new sweetnes of the jam will take you on yet another cognitive journey, a nirvana making you wonder if you are in colorado."}
{"text":"Fire is truly a great place to get some food in town.  It is a great place to take a date and spend an evening, and the atmosphere inside is just incredible.  The head chef and owner, Doug Katz, is incredible and really concentrates on using only the best ingredients, especially products that are grown and produced locally.

If you are looking for a quality meal in a nice part of town (and don't mind the minor inconvenience of location) give Fire a try.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Woot! I like Fire.

Jumping on the restaurant week specials, I called up some people I met in my apartment building to go out for restaurant week. They're new to the area as well, so they're like me- pretty much every restaurant is new! We settled on Fire.

Fire has nice decor. You walk in, and you're greeted to a darker restaurant, with tables lit by candles, and a type of old fashioned look-there's a pipe running along the type of the ceiling, and a big giant mirror on the wall (which one of my apartment mates kept people watching in). We all ordered off the restaurant week menu.

Appetizers: Fried green tomatoes or beet salad. I've never had beets before, so I settled on the tomatoes. The tomato dish had some tomatoes, jalapenos, and a crispy goat cheese and okra and corn. It was pretty good. The beet salad looked good as well, and I had a bite of a beet...and it was interesting? Not sure if I'm a beet fan.

Entrees: All came out a good size. There was the seafood vera cruz- a mix of scallops, mussels, clams, etc, all over a bed of rice. Others got the whole wheat tagliatelle with pesto and parmesan dish, which they claimed was good as well. I ordered the \"steak and eggs\"- hanger steak with a poached egg, spinach, and sauce...oh man, it was heavy, but soo good. The steak was just right at medium rare, and the marinade was amazing. The popovers accompanied our meal, and they were great. They were so hot right out of the oven, and with their local honey butter? omg, so good!

Dessert: I got the plum upside down cake. Very moist and very good..and heavy. My friend got the cinnamon hot fudge ice cream.. Also looked good.

My only gripe of this place was the service. it was SLOW. REALLY SLOW. I mean, we were the only ones in the restaurant at the end...where in the world was our waitress? Also, the valet guy didn't even wait for us to finish...instead came over to our table and handed us the keys. Since when can valet guys do that?

Besides the service, the food was great. :)"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review for this place, and finally getting around to it. First, I had a coupon from Travelzoo... 2 alcoholic drinks, 1 side, 2 entrees for Saturday brunch all for $29. Not bad. Bf had a mimosa, and I had a bellini; not bad. Ordered an additional appetizer.. the home made sausages. Now, I am not a sausage fan, but these were SO delectable, that I had to go back for a few more bites. The only gripe is that the sausages cost $5, but they come out as two small circles on a small plate. Could have done more with that plating. Entrees... ordered the duck and the croque madame. The duck was so tasty, tender, melt in your mouth. My bf loved the grits that came underneath the duck. The croque madame was not the least bit dry for being a large sandwich. Very very tasty. 

But the best part? Those sticky buns. I don't even like sweets, but mmmmm. SO tasty. Still dreaming of them to this very day. Definitely looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of Shaker Square sits a lovely little restaurant known as Fire. I've only been here once but per friend reviews the brunch is even better than the food we got (how could this be!?). Simple and unique flavors blend to create culinary delights! I tried the pizza with gruyere cheese (the creamy bubbly cheese most commonly used on french onion soup), mushrooms, and caramelized onions. Plate sizes are manageable-  unlike chain restaurants, you go there to enjoy quality food, not quantity of food. Simply fantastic and I hope to return to try the brunch soon with another mimosa."}
{"text":"Best brunch I have had in Cleveland! We came up here on a whim because we saw that the pictures looked amazing, and the pictures do not lie! When we got there it was about noon on an Sunday and the line was about out the door. If you are going on a Sunday be prepared to wait (our wait time was about 45 minutes) unless you make a reservation. After we got seated, everything was perfect. I ordered a coffee and a starlight mint cocktail- I recommend this cocktail if you are looking for a drink that its not too sweet (price: $11). For brunch, I got a sticky bun and the masala fish sandwich and the eggs benedict. Every single meal was perfect in their own way. The sticky bun was sweet but had that perfect bun consistency and was not dry at all (price: $4). The masala fish sandwich was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and it was amazing - I highly recommend this dish (price: $14 I think). The eggs benedict were also very well cooked and tasted amazing! The service was on point too! The hostess told us the right wait time and was friendly. Our server was very helpful and really polite (she also gave me the drink recommendation) and the runners were happy to help as well. My favorite part of the service was that the Chef Douglas Katz also came out to see how everything was, which made the meal seem more personal too! I am dying to go back to this place for dinner but I feel as if there is no way to go wrong on their brunch!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with my friends and got the breakfast pizza.  I am a fan.  I might up this to 5 stars after I get a chance to go a few more times.  I really liked the bloody mary but it does have spiciness that sneaks up on you so keep that in mind if you don't like heat.  It's not the cheapest place but it is a good value for what you're getting.  High quality organic and local ingredients in unique dishes.  Also they have a patio and we had some great weather.  I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic birthday dinner for first timers in the place like us. We loved everything we ordered--the trout and ribeye were exceptional. Chef Katz even took his time in explaining the menu for the night since we have someone who has food allergies. This would have been a 5-star if it wasn't for the loudness of the place, and that they served one of our appetizers way late than the rest. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly service, AMAZING eggs benedict (my wife's blueberry lemon pancakes were awesome as well) and a seat at the window was a lovely setting for Sunday brunch.  Nicest brunch I've had in a while.  Food presentation was a little lacking and I wasn't really into the greens side salad (it's eggs benedict, gets some potatoes on there!) but all in all, great brunch.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Nice location. Decent service. Very average food. I went for dinner with a group of 7.  For the price of the dishes, the food was not extraordinary.  My GF had their duck dish and it was too oily for her palate. I had the walleye.... again nothing extraordinary.  I think I've had better walleye at The Tavern (a gastropub in Cleveland Heights).

I've heard that their brunch is very good, but I haven't had the courage to try it yet. It's a very nice looking interior/ambience, but unfortunately that may be the best thing going for it."}
{"text":"SInce our move to the east side, we've been trying to find places close to home to enjoy.  Fire has been fitting that bill for us with one exception - we really only enjoy sitting at the bar.  

The main restaurant has a bit of a snobby atmosphere that I don't enjoy. The menu is always delicious and tries to be as organic and sustainable as possible, which I appreciate.  The steak is delicious, especially, but they also have a few bar snack type items (pizzas, cheese plates) that make it easier to sit at the bar.  

They have also either hired a new bar manager or just revamped their cocktail menus - I don't remember their drinks being this good when we visited a few years ago.  Nothing is overly inventive but all of their syrups and infusions are done in-house and that does add an extra something to the drinks.  The wine list here is also outstanding with lots of different regions represented in the glass pours.

Next step, brunch."}
{"text":"We had a perfect night here. The food was amazing. We had the duck fritters and the pork chips which were divine. The thyme Moscow mule was the best I have ever had. Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I can only speak to brunch at Fire, but this is an excellent brunch option if you're keeping local to Cleveland. This is a brunch place where you will experience some new takes on brunch and flavors.

I have to echo other reviews about the sticky buns as they are just incredible in flavor and texture. Definitely order a few of these to start for the table (especially because they are hard to share, they're just that good). The mimosa options are unique and an excellent touch to the menu. The french press was also enjoyable offering a range of intensity and flavors.

We've been through most of the menu through our many visits. Some of our favorites are the lemon souffle pancakes which are so light and flavorful, the fire benedict made with in house muffin that makes the difference, and surprisingly the masala fried fish sandwich which is perfectly fried and has a great finish with the mint. 

So look over the menu and the descriptions. If it sounds like something you would try, definitely go and check this place out."}
{"text":"I think this is such a cool place to be. It's modern, yet so homey feeling. I love the seasonally changing food menu and have never had an issue here to date. The servers are friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. I just went again for restaurant week and definitely recommend both of the items being offered as mains - I've had them both over the course of various seasons and the steak last night and they are always great. Reservations definitely needed as both the restaurant and bar will fill up on weekend evenings. Free parking behind Dave's supermarket or complimentary valet at certain times in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The best meal I've had from a restaurant in a very long time.

The meat is cooked so well, it's always tender and seasoned well. I had the Pork Chop and the sides made it all come together. 

The menu is pricy but it's well worth it. Atmosphere was nice and warm. I would love to go back! Try their homemade lemonade, too!"}
{"text":"The bf and I went for a late night dinner on Sunday -- got there 1 hour before closing.  We sat through a very nice meal, lots of talking, had great service, and were never rushed, even at the end of the night.  I hate it when places start vacuuming while customers are still eating.

Food: We started with the mussels, they were delicious.  It was a good large sized portion, more than enough for up to a table of 4 to share for a few each as an appetizer.  I got the pork chops, yumm! It came with butternut squash puree, bread pudding, and brussel sprouts.  The whole plate was perfect.  He ordered duck confit and appeared to like it enough.  I took a bite and thought it was too salty.

Overall, it was a good evening with good food.  Would def go back.
-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"We have tried brunch 4 times already! I wish they change the menu though for new treats but the hash, pancakes and the toast are my top choices! 
We did a dinner and it was great! I would recommend this any time!! Dinner portions are decent but overpriced. Flavors are great"}
{"text":"Arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation during Restaurant Week. Place was packed, but we were seated within a few minutes. Had a table by the window. Romantic!  First thing we were told was that portions would be smaller than the regular menu. We had looked at the limited menu online. Everything we ordered was delicious. Pollack was fresh and tender. Chicken kielbasa was smoked perfectly, and wonderfully. The tiny salads and garnishes added to the presentation and the tastes. The popcorn ice cream with pralines dessert tasted buttery yum. The chocolate and berries were refreshing. Portions were smaller, but we were comfortably full. The price was perfect. Service great. We enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"A perfect night for an anniversary dinner. The food is simple but delicious and we couldn't stop eating the food. AND the portions are a good size, won't leave you hungry. Our dinner that night: crispy chicken livers, mushroom arugula salad, tandoor roasted fish (YUM), and miller farm steak. 

As the website states, this is simple, good food. And I love that they support local farmers. This place is great if you want a relaxed, unpretentious night with good food."}
{"text":"Fire Food and Drink is one of my favorite restaurants for both brunch and dinner. Owner Doug Katz's devotion to fresh, quality ingredients and sustainable seafood make it easy to enjoy. They were easily able to accommodate my mother's many food allergies, which she appreciated. I think I've had almost every brunch item on the menu, but my favorites are the pastrami hash, the egg sandwich on fry bread, the smoked salmon plate, and the lemon souffle pancakes. The tandoor oven makes the food roasted in there delicious - whether it is the pork chop, steak or fish. The steaks are definitely worth the steep price!! They melt in your mouth. For those on a budget, Doug's PEI mussels are amazing, and I have been known to come here for just the mussels, a salad and popovers. The drinks are unique, and the attention to detail is apparent in little things like the tea brewing contraption they use. The free valet parking is also a nice plus on Shaker Square."}
{"text":"Fire really is as good as it gets, Yelp! 5 stars!

Since our first visit, my husband and I have returned to Fire on two more special occasions: to celebrate getting our marriage license and, more recently, on my birthday. 

We have now had three different Fire experiences: dinner, brunch, and cocktails/appetizers, and for each, Fire is the best of the best.

The most important thing that you need to know about Fire is that they have the absolute BEST BURGER in Cleveland, if not the world! The garlic fries alone are a borderline erotic experience. 

I recommend the brunch here wholeheartedly for an affordable way to experience this incredible culinary gem. The BBQ beef crepe was to die for! 

Looking forward to our next special occasion to visit Fire again! (Veteran's Day is right around the corner!)"}
{"text":"We stopped in on the recommendation of a New York friend.  So there a recommendation to start with, New York recommending Cleveland.  

 They took our reservation and were ready when we walked in the door.  We almost always share so the decisions were diverse.  Chilled Noodles and Mussels.  Two dishes.  The Noodles were great, a touch of ginger to brighten the flavor.  Mmmm.  The Mussels came at the same time so we were reaching over each other to taste the other appetizer.  To be way cliche....the broth with the Mussels may be 'to die for'.  Tomato and garlic and bears oh MY.  I told the waiter I might consider moving to Cleveland for the mussels and garlic toast. 

I had roasted chicken with fried green tomatoes and succotash, which I normally don't eat (lima beans... shudder!) but was delicious.  My husband had tuna over asparagus and lentils.  They were both incredibly good (especially the chicken for breakfast the next morning).

We had a lovely lemon tart with lemonade  sorbet.  The coffee was hot and fresh and perfect. 

So, now not only does New York recommend Cleveland and FIRE, but Philadelphia does, too!"}
{"text":"My favorite fancy brunch! Every item was delicious! Had to try the cinnamon roll! The breads are home made. A lot of times I don't like \"fancy\" food bc it's over priced and over rated in the flavor department. The food here was flavorful and savory! Got the breakfast pizza and was so in love with it. Service was also very good!"}
{"text":"Their brunch is delectable! Never been here for any other meal but I'm sure that they wouldn't disappoint. The servers are always really nice and informative--never overly attentive to your table. The server we had last we was really great with our son and gave us suggestions as to what he may like off the menu, even taking off some things that might not be appetizing for him. I recommend this hot spot to families or even for a nice date. Great food and experience for a price that's affordable"}
{"text":"I'm such a atmosphere person and Fire has it for me! The tables are close to each other but great vibes. The waitress kept our water filled and Chef Katz came to the table to greet us on a Sunday afternoon brunch! It was nice to see Chef helping with dishes and filling water very humbling! It was a bit pricey, our brunch was $78.00! Whoa, wasn't expecting that hahaha. Sis had the shrimp and grits and it was a skimpy portion expected more. Overall excellent restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been to fire twice for brunch and once for dinner and every time the meal is amazing!  

First of all, the place is beautiful.   The high ceilings give it a sophistication and the decor is casual but elegant.  All the servers are friendly and knowledgable and the wine list is comprehensive.  All the food is fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend anyone come here for brunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"One of my very favorite restaurants. The Caesar salad and duck confit are out of this world."}
{"text":"With Fire's reputation and prices, I was expecting to have an experience that I'd remember.  Well, I did not.  Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad, it was good.  It just didn't blow me away, and for the price, I was expecting it to.  The restaurant is gorgeous and the staff is friendly and professional.  The owner came to our table and thanked us for coming, I thought that was classy.  I would return, maybe if they have a happy hour or I had a coupon."}
{"text":"Um... Yum!!? I've only had brunch here, but it's fabulous!! Came here on a Saturday, so of course Shaker Square was packed, but I took advantage of the free valet (you should too, awesome perk!) I want to come for dinner soon, they recently changed their menu to their fall menu (I love this they change their food menu every season, indicating they use the freshest of ingredients!)

I just HAD to order the sticky buns for the table... they were AMAZING!! If they're on the menu, I highly recommend them! Perfect amount of sweetness and ... stickiness? For my entree, I got the breakfast pizza - eggs, home fries, (bacon), home fries, and farmers cheese. It was wonderful! I found it a bit salty, but that clearly didn't prevent me from eating almost the entire thing!! I also tried their bloody mary (they have a spicier option and a spicy but not as spicy as the spicier option and I opted for the not so spicy). It still had a perfect amount of spice and was delish. I like my bloody marys more pickly- although this was a good BM, it didn't satisfy me on that note.

The service was great. There was an issue with my friends side dish and it was immediately taken back to fix (it took a while to get back out, but he had his entree so we weren't complaining). The manager was also walking around talking to all of the tables, and I love when they do that!! 

I will definitely be back for brunch and want to try the dinner (although reviews suggest that brunch is really where it's at at fire)"}
{"text":"I always love dining at Fire. It is one of my favorite places in Cleveland.

Yes, it's on the upscale side, so it's somewhere I'd got more for a special occasion. But the food is always impeccable, and the service is always attentive.

This time around, I went to brunch, and I had delicious lemon blueberry pancakes and a side of bacon.

My only complaint is that the Bellini I ordered was not available, since they were out of peach puree (who doesn't have Bellini mix for Sunday brunch?!). The server brought me one made with mango instead (without checking first), which I, unfortunately, had to turn away, since I am actually allergic to mango (weird, I know, but it's true!).

The best part was that the chef actually came out to greet all the patrons and ensure everything was to their expectations. He even cleared away some dishes as he went, which I would never expect of a chef! It really showed he cared!"}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday for a spontaneous brunch. My wife and I shared the shrimp fried rice and beef crepes....both were great. We sat in the bar where the bartender was really helpful with the menu and very friendly. The dining room looked a bit un-private and the tables were real close together, so I will likely choose a bar table if available. The bar area was very lively and the chef made rounds to assure satisfaction. Nice clean restrooms which is always a give away of a restaurant that really cares about its patrons. This is a great place with really tasty food, fair prices and caring staff."}
