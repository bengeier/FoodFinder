{"text":"A great new restaurant in our neighbourhood, have been few times now. The cobb salad is my favourite along with the chicken meatballs and sandwich and the mashed potatoes. All the meals I have had were excellent. Their house sangria is also fab. Not a great selection of wines (and a little pricey for the location) or beer, but I think the plan is to add more. They opened for brunch first time last week but I didn't get to go, but hope that will continue.  A must visit."}
{"text":"I have been twice now.  First time was for drinks, (their ceasar is amazing) and the second was for dinner with two other couples.   I got the basa entr√©e and it was incredible.  My husband got the grilled chicken salad and it was HUGE.  I couldn't believe it.  Everytime we leave restaurants he usually says he is still hungry.  Not this time!  Actually all 6 of us raved about our food.  Id def recommend the tiramisu for dessert as well. 

The owners and staff are extremely friendly.  Great neighborhood spot. Very cozy on a cold winter night."}
{"text":"Have been here twice, one for beers and once for some food & cocktails.  The drinks and service was outstanding both times.  Plan on heading back once their little patio opens up!"}
{"text":"THIS IS BY FAR MY MOST HORRENDOUS RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE.

To sum up for those who won't read my essay of a review: we arrived at 8, our mains came at 10:45 we tried to leave because the food was taking too long the manger promised to comp our drinks if we stayed for mains and then refused to do so once we ate and then threatened to call the police when we argued that they had lied to us to get us to stay and eat. 

So the essy begins...

Myself and 7 other friends made a reservation over the phone on Tuesday to go to King Rustic on the same Friday at 8 for a small celebratory dinner.

We arrived promptly at 8 and notified the hostess that we had a reservation, we were met with blank stares and then asked when we made the reservation and if we made it over the phone. it was clear they did not have a table ready for us so we waited about 5 minutes while they scrambled to push tables together to accommodate us which was fine it wasn't a very big deal. 

we then ordered drink and appetizers. The drinks came in a reasonable amount of time but the appetizers took about 45 minutes ... Yes FORTY-FIVE MInutes! 

The Sangria tasted like watered down fruitopia, we ordered 3 pitchers and between 3 girls we had 6 glasses each. My friend who is under 5 feet, under 100lbs didnt even have a buzz she  would normally be pissed drunk after that many drinks. so Im summary there was little if any alcohol in out Sangria. 

For appetizers we ordered 1 fried chicken, 1 cheese dip and 1 nacho. the friend chicken was very nice (my favourite thing), cheese dip was pleasant, the nachos were mediocre as best some of the chips were soggy. 

we then placed out main orders, after I kid you not another 45 mins of waiting we flagged down our waitress to see what was going on it was now 10:30 and we did not have main courses. She said she could check and get back to us. She returned to our table to inform us that they were out of beef burgers which 2 of us had ordered but that they have chicken or turkey burgers available (cant remember which) we agreed to the substitution 

about 10 mins she started bringing two main courses out. The burgers that were ordered we ordered with cajun fries they came with mashed potatoes, we informed the waitress we ordered Cajun fries and she said the kitchen was out of cajun fries. So at this point the only thing on my plate that was not a substitution was the burger buns. She asked if i wanted to order something else, I said okay.... I said \"I'll have the fish tacos\" she said \" sorry we're out of fish tacos\". I said \"okay, I will have the friend chicken\" she replied \"I'm so sorry we're out of friend chicken\" At this point I was obviously frustrated. So we said you know what we're just gonna get the bills for the apps and the drinks and go.

The manager then came carrying in his hand two new burgers WITH the cajun fries we were told just 5 minutes ago they were out of. We explained our situation and that we would simply pay and leave. He apologized and said he really wanted us to have our main courses because they were ready and that he would comp our drinks. We were reluctant but he insisted so we decided to stay. at this point 2 of the 8 who couldn't wait any longer had left. They brought all 8 main courses anyways. The food was mediocre it was simply edible. 

When the bill came none of the drinks we comped we asked why the manager then said he would only comp 4 beers. The table drank 4 bottles of wine, 3 pitchers of Sangria in addition to the 4 beer and this was all before the offered to comp us so we were prepared to pay for everything we consumed. But they refused and when my friend and I went up to explain that we completely understand why they won't comp the bottles of wine as we expected that they wouldnt and that they are making us pay for food we didnt even want to eat, we basically did them a favour by staying and paying for food that took an hour to come the least they can do is comp the sangria and beers like promised, the female manager said if we did not pay our bills and leave she was going to call the police.

IT WAS A HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE. I WOULD NEVER IN MY LIFE SET FOOT BACK INTO THIS RESTAURANT!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here from my bday with 12 friends. I had left it pretty late on finding a place to make a reservation, but had no problem booking here.  The food was really good, great selection for drinks and the server was great too. Only down side is that they don't split bills.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Kind Rustic's new location doesn't have the same charm as the original establishment but its not for a lack of trying. While the owner's have done a great job to maintain the look and feel of the restaurant, the industrial architecture of the new building just doesn't blend well with the distressed wood theme....for this reason I wouldn't plan on coming here on a first date or anything. 

That aside, I would come here if you are looking for a quick bite with a variety of food options. If you are in the mood for some gluttony or are watching your waistline, I'd say there is something for everyone here. Specifically, I really liked the baked brie with honey, cajun chicken, and manchego burger . The only downside with the food is that they do tend to over season with salt IMO. I definitely plan on ordering from here again but it'll likely be via uber eats."}
{"text":"The Good:
Original menu.
Consistent quality.
Nice decor.
 
The Bad:
90% of the time, the service is excruciatingly slow. 
The \"side\" consists of 8-10 potato chips. 
Not particularly affordable. 

Overall: 
If you have some time to kill, and you're in the mood for something a little different from normal pub fare, King Rustic is worth a try."}
{"text":"While we were staying at the Thompson hotel last week in Downtown Toronto, i asked one of the staff if there was a place around the area that me and my friends can go and have a great time. They recommended us  King Rustic, we went there we were astounded, it reminded us of a  place that we always go in New York City. We sat down, the waiter took care of us right away with a big smile, we felt so welcoming. We look at the menu and is great, their food selection gives everything from Perogies to Spanish Adobe meatballs. It was hard for and my friends to decide what to order because everything sounded exquisite.     

I personally started with the spinach dip and then i ordered the Grilled Chicken Cajun style, so delicious and to drink i had a Vodka Martini on the rocks with three olives  which it was perfectly made by the bartender. In our opinion between fusion foods is one of the hottest trends in the world, and i've been to a lot of places.

By the way if anyone who doesn't understand what fusion inspired cooking  means, it's the combination of elements from different culinary traditions. My friends and i are more than happy with the service, the drinks and the food. We're definitely visit King Rustic again, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Went to the King Rustic on Valentine's (it's right now)  and had to rush to post this review. The staff there is amazing, my one server Veronica was absolutely wonderful. I was recommended the kale salad with salmon, which I don't remember the name, and it was absolutely incredible. It hit ever taste bud. They also had live jazz music that really set a beautiful tone. Everyone was having a blast. 

10/10 would visit again."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious. We shared the fried chicken and the perogies. The chicken was flavourful, the fries were well spiced but the salad was kind of boring. The perogies were massive! They were full of flavour. I wasn't overly keen on the turkey bacon but that's just personal preference. Also the ginger haste was refreshing. All in all I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is fine - nothing great - but the service is abysmal. The last time I went there, I ordered the salmon salad. When my salmon salad came out, the salmon wasn't in a solid piece - it looked like they had broken it (dropped it?) in the kitchen and then just scooped it on top of the salad anyway. There were a lot of wait staff working, but they were mostly talking to each other or behind the bar. I finally got someone's attention, and she told me they could remake it for me if I was really unhappy \"but sometimes it just comes out as one piece, and sometimes it comes out as a lot of little pieces.\" Ridiculous. She should have just apologized and taken it away - or not brought it out in the first place."}
{"text":"Maybe I was expected too much, but I was completely disappointed. The southern chicken was dry and tasteless, the seasoned fries, even though I requested well done fries they where mostly limp and mushy. 

I'm not sure I'd give this place a second look, the only thing they got right was my drink but it's hard to screw that up. The atmosphere was fine no worries there, service acceptable, I just had the wrong cook on the wrong day, but it certainly was not worth the money. 

Very disappointing!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to King Rustic twice. The first time was pretty good but the second time not so much. We ordered the guacamole and the chips were chewy and soaked in oil. The fish tacos were also pretty dry. I believe there was only one server working, which isn't fair but service was quite slow/inattentive."}
{"text":"One of my favourite old fashioneds in the city. I got three with dinner. I got the burger but found it pretty dry. The service was pretty slow for a Saturday especially considering it wasn't very crowded. They had a live band so that made up for it.

I'd come here again for drinks in an instant but would only try the food again if someone else wanted it. 

Three stars for the old fashioned and the live band."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special and don't think they deserve such a high overall score. My friend suggested going to this place because she lived nearby and wanted to support a local business.

Their menu wasn't too big but half the items were crossed out. I ordered a draft beer and when the waiter brought it, it wasn't filled to the top. He said they ran out and couldn't fill up the entire glass (which was smaller than a pint) and said they would take $1 off the beer. He didn't even ask if I wanted to have a different beer.

I ordered a hangar steak with a side of brussel sprouts. The hangar steak doesn't come with any sides at all. Both dishes were over-salted and portions are tiny. I think I got a total of 8 brussel sprouts. 

It must have been the server's first day because he meticulously wrote down my order but had to double check again on what drink I ordered within 2 minutes. The waiter brought our food but didn't give us cutlery until we flagged him down. Then he brought forks and knives without napkins even though his platter had napkins on them. He came back with napkins but essentially threw them on the table.

When we got our check, he forgot about the \"discount\" on my beer and was confused about splitting the cheque. He was also waiting right over your shoulder so I guess he's pretty desperate for tips.

I wouldn't go out of my way to dine at this restaurant. If you're in the area and want salty food but in small portions, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Some very tasty - albeit rich - dishes, like their baked camembert. Decor is fun, bar stock is good.  But it is way way way too noisy to bear!   Can't go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, partially because it's about a block from where I live. The food has been consistently good every time I've been there. The first time I ordered the lamb chops, and I cleaned my plate at a frankly uncivilized speed, apparently to the amazement of the chef when it came back. The brussel sprouts were great for some reason. Brussel sprouts never taste that good when I cook them. I call black magic.

Since then I've had the cajun style grilled chicken, the penne alla vodka and the rustic cobb salad, and they were all pretty top notch. Another reviewer complained about portion size, but the portions always seemed pretty good to me.

Service is mostly okay, but they do seem a bit slow and forgetful from time to time, even when the place is only moderately busy."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Cool environment that is great for a date. Try their infused alcohol - pear and fig bourbon and jalape√±o tequila to name a few."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was really cool. Good decor and good vibes. The food was pretty good too. My wife and I had the perogies, the guac and both the chicken dishes. Not sure if they were understaffed or if it was just an off night but food came out super slow and took forever for us to get out of there. Would like to give it another shot one day."}
{"text":"I'm actually shocked this place does not have any reviews yet.

I normally wouldn't eat anywhere that has NO reviews but our friends swore by it and convinced us to join them

Really, from start to finish, it was a fabulous meal: the service was great; the food was very tasty and well presented; and the drinks were boozy.

We shared the baked brie and meatballs to start, I had the hanger steak and my wife had the salmon, we shared the tiramisu for dessert. Everything was cooked perfectly and really quite enjoyable

Check it out, it's a fun neighbourhood place with good food and drinks"}
{"text":"Get a seat by the window to watch the transients from the halfway house next door walk by.  The entertainment is endless. 

That being said, the turkey sandwich is fantastic. A nice ratio of protein to bread. 

My girlfriends shepherds pie looked great, but when I tasted it all I got was rosemary.  No beef or potato taste, only the herb.  

It was good, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I had the penne ala vodka and it was amazing! The servers were also really friendly and informative. The ambiance is perfect for a get together with friends over some beer and shareables. Great food, great service, great vibes."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. If you are looking for fantastic comfort food this is your place. We have walked by so many times and the perogies caught our eye. The sauce on the Swedish meatballs rocked. As do the garlic mashed potatoes.  No need to head to the local pubs - this is way better bang for your buck. Seriously give it a try."}
{"text":"King Rustic is one of the newest spots on King West, and I was super duper excited to check it out after drooling over the yummy looking fusion menu.

I came here on a Thursday evening and this place was dead. I think maybe one or two other small parties the entire time we were there came in and out. However, even though there were not many customers, service was painfully slow. From refilling water, to getting dishes out, slow slow slow all around. Super friendly, though. The staff even gave us a free, and EXTREMELY delicious tiramisu to share (and I am quite picky when it comes to tiramisu!)

Food was decent, but not outstanding. The prices are a bit weird. Apps are very similar in price to mains which can be a bit of a deterrent when considering an app. I did steal some of the brie app and it was quite tasty! Melty, gooey goodness, paired with their AMAZING bread (I think it's a grilled focaccia? Whatever it is, their bread is out of this world.)

Outside of the brie, bread, and tiramisu, other items around the table were good, but nothing to write home about.

I was a little underwhelmed in the end, but definitely wasn't a bad experience! I think with some service & menu tweaks, King Rustic would be a place I'd definitely return to."}
{"text":"Came with kind of low expectations due to the last merchant that was in this space. The decor was proper I was surprised once I got in there. The server was extra nice and you could tell she cared. I feel like the cocktails were the real highlight which isn't broadcasted enough on the website and in the marketing. Love dem King Cubes. The meatball sub was real good and the cajun chicken wasnt all that. I feel like it was lacking a bit of flavour. I love brussel sprouts and I thoroughly enjoyed King Rustics. Overall I am glad this spot is in my hood now. Def made it in the roto. One small suggestion would be fresh ground pepper. Holler."}
{"text":"I can't put into words how absolutely delicious King Rustic has been, each and every visit. I live quite close so there has been many occasions where I have gone in for lunch and dinner both by myself and with a group of friends. 

The atmosphere-from the dim lights and candles, to the music and rustic feel, has been completely enjoyable. The staff is very accommodating and the owners even go out of their way to ensure your experience has been everything you expected and more.

I've ordered a variety of different dishes but some of my favourites include the meatballs, perogies, steak, manchego burger, turkey club, butternut squash soup and cobb salad. Each dish has been packed with flavour with exquisite presentations. A lot of the times it's hard to find a place downtown that's affordable and also a bang for your money, but King Rustic has very tasty foods for relatively good prices and not to mention great portion sizes.

I definitely recommend trying this place out! Always an amazing experience"}
{"text":"Always enjoy our meals at the Rustic: personable staff that can help out with choices, and great food too!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place, it's perfect for catching up with an old friend, or perfect for a more intimate setting. It lives up to its name for the ambiance.
We tried the servers suggestions; lamb sliders, chicken meatballs and the burger. A good selection of beers and cocktails. 
My favourite was the lamb sliders they were dressed perfectly.
My friend loved the meatballs as an app. it was very generous portion and something a little different.
The burger was served med rare quite red which would alarm some people, but also dressed well. 
They were out of the perogies, so I would try those next time.
 Our server doubled as a bartender that night and made a mean Old Fashion"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Underrated, we were in town from California, and they had the best menu I've ever seen. I got the shephards pie, and it was great, served in a little cast iron, it stayed hot the whole time."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at King Rustic.  They just opened a couple weeks ago and used to be located kitty-corner to their new location (King Street W/Strachan Avenue).

Gord ordered the Herb Fried Chicken Dinner.  He said it was good and he'd get it again.  I tried a piece of his chicken and it was delicious, especially when dipped in the accompanying sauce.
  
I ordered the Sicilian Lasagna.  The salad that came with it was delightful.  The lasagna was a large serving but it wasn't great.  It could have used more meat/tomato sauce and less ricotta cheese (or whatever the white stuff was in the middle) ... I ended up digging it out and putting it aside.  I wouldn't get this again.
 
We both ordered dessert ... all they had was chocolate cake.  It was just okay.

Adam was our server.  He was really friendly.

It was jammed when we left with people waiting for tables."}
{"text":"Came with a group of about 7 on a Sunday evening. True to its name the restaurant has a very nice rustic feel - a great place to bring a date. It is dimly lit and well decorated. Between the 7 of us we ordered the perogies, the lamb sliders, the lasagna, the Cajun chicken, herbed chicken and steak. Everyone was very pleased with both the service and the meal. The sangria was also delicious. The menu has a nice selection of options - something for everyone. I personally would highly recommend the lamb sliders they were great! Overall I had a great dining experience and would recommend."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood place with surprisingly good food (and sizable portions) and bartenders that take the time to think about their beer list and curated cocktails. Never seems as busy as it should be, so please Yelp'ers keep this place in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"The 5 stars are for the staff, the food, and the drinks. I had the salmon with kale and it was terrific! There was a perfect blend of flavors but even more importantly than the food, the staff were so warm and friendly and gave terrific suggestions. I'm new to the neighborhood but I will DEFINITELY be back. 

go to the bar and sit with Lauren. He's great!"}
{"text":"Lived in the area for years, first time coming in. So glad we did. Both had burgers and they were awesome! West Avenue cider was the best damn thing.  Server was Jason, attentive and fun. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and my old office used to be right across the street. Safe to say it was one of the frequent watering holes after work. Usually here for good craft beer on tap, and a small snack the odd time. Had the Cobb salad(Huge!), and the burgers which were decent too. They do have infused spirits in-house which I've dabbled in a few times. Cool spot if your close by and lazy to walk a couple blocks."}
{"text":"Everything I have had here is excellent. And the menu says all the produce are organic."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 12 for a birthday on a Friday night. I understand we were a big group and a fair wait for our food is reasonable, but it took us an hour and a half for our food to arrive!!!! We ordered at 8:30pm, and food was served at 10pm. I've never had dinner this late. The worst part is they didn't even come check up on us in between letting us know the status of our food, instead they only kept asking if we wanted more drinks. When I asked the waitress if our food was ever going to come, she says \"yes it's on its way, there's only 2 people working in the kitchen and we did order a lot of food\". Really? You would only have 2 people working in your kitchen on a Friday night? 
It sucks because I kept seeing them take food out from the kitchen, but it went to all the other tables except us - which makes no sense to me since we were there before those other tables. When the food arrived, I was pretty much hangry (hungry + angry). 

My friends and I just ordered a bunch of appetizers to share.
Don't get the tacos. Saw the $5 taco deal and seeing other people's plates it did look good, but it was a disappointment. The fish taco is not the usual fried fish kind of taco. it was just grilled,

Mama's Perogie ($13)
This was one of the top recommended items at this restaurant. Comes with 3 large pieces. Essentially it's dumplings filled with garlic mash, mushrooms, and caramelized onions, topped with sour cream, bacon and fried onions. It was tasty but lacked a bit of flavor - needed the sour cream and bacon bits, I personally prefer dumpling skin that is not as thick but I believe that is the style of perogies. 

Fried Chicken ($14)
Comes with 3 large pieces (boneless and skinless chicken breast and thighs), a salad and fries. The chicken were deep fried in herbs to add some flavor, they were nice and crispy. Nothing special in my opinion.

Signature Chicken Meatballs ($12)
It comes with 3 large meatballs. Was actually pretty tasty, the texture of the meat was nice and soft, slightly juicy which was good considering it was chicken meat. The sauce was really good - the dish came with bread for you to dip in the sauce so both went really well together. 

Lasagna ($16)
Comes with a salad on the side. I personally enjoyed the lasagna the most. It was cooked just right and not overly done - I liked how the layers of pasta were still slightly chewy and not mushy like typical restaurants. You actually couldn't slice the lasagna with just the side of the fork and would need a knife. Loved the flavor. It had a decent amount of cheese, meat and sauce - even spread of each and it didn't taste heavy at all.

I really like the atmosphere and deco of this restaurant - has a real rustic, wooden vintage kind of look. They even serve their food on wooden plates. Some of their drinks are served in like King's cup/medieval looking cups which is cook. Food is ok, but I don't think I'd go back. There are better restaurants in downtown toronto. I would say it's a chill place to go, but don't go in groups considering how slow they serve their food."}
{"text":"*** 3-1/2 STARS ***

I was here with a group of 7 people last week for dinner. 
I was also surprised there hasn't been any reviews anywhere and I was even more surprised that I live a couple blocks away often get takeout at Sushi 930 next door and never knew this place existed -- it has been open since the beginning of last December. The space was once Saviari Tea & Cocktail Lounge, which was an interesting concept, but was plagued by a rather cheap and uninviting atmosphere and always lacking in customers. 

I had my doubts about this restaurant when I first saw their menu online. Their food is claimed to be rustic fusion, which sounds rather like a cop out and their dishes sounded lack-lustre with nothing that really stands out.
When I arrived at the restaurant I noticed they did a good job in transforming the once bleak space into a place that is much more warm and welcoming. In keeping with the rustic theme, there is lots of rustic wood furniture and paneling, rustic nik-naks, and the proverbial Edison bulb light fixtures everywhere. While the space is much improved, however the restaurant feels a bit odd, as the floor was dominated by a couple rows of large bar-height tables down the middle of the restaurant with dining tables on either side. This lack of room and flow seemed to make it difficult for the servers to attend to their diners and it makes walking to the bar or bathroom more cumbersome. The TV sitting at the end of the bar was on the Rogers channel preview channel and was very distracting. The rustic themed effort of the restaurant felt almost like a Lone Star restaurant trying to be hipster, which the atmosphere seemed to be a bit off or not quite put together.
The music was a mix of electronic and funk, which I liked but was played way too loud, especially when there were not that many people there.

I started off with their Apple Crown cocktail which on the menu said it was a must try, which I did and it was very tasty. It was Crown Royal with lemon tea, infused honey, house made bitters, dusted with cinnamon with a dried apple slice on top of a large cube of ice. It wasn't overly sweet and had enough booze which I really liked. I would order this again, though they had a nice and interesting cocktail menu selection.

My table had a couple orders of the brie appetizer which was baked brie topped with toasted pine nuts and drizzled with honey and served with slices of ciabatta, they all really liked it.
I had a really hard time ordering my main course as nothing really stood out and many of the dishes were either very simple or served with tomato sauce which seemed like a very easy and had potential of being bad (at least in my experience). The menu was a mix of Italian, English pub, Mediterranean, and bits of other cuisines, so it really had no focus which was why I was having trouble ordering something I would really like -- everything felt really safe.

I went with the hangar steak as I was craving steak. I wanted their perogie dish, but they didn't have any that night.
I requested the steak be cooked medium-rare but more on the rare side. I found the beef on the tough side despite being perfectly cooked, but it was well seasoned and nice flavor. The sides of mashed potatoes tasted creamy and buttery good, the asparagus was tender, however the side salad was barely dressed and dry and the odd side of guacamole didn't go with anything on this dish and I didn't care for it. A salsa verde or chimichurri sauce would be much more welcomed here.

Every else in my party seemed to like their dishes, though someone had a side of brussel sprouts which arrived cold and was overcooked and too soft.
One dish that looked really impressive was their Double Grilled Cheese Beef Sliders. The dish came with two sliders and they were much larger and substantial than your typical slider. It was essentially a burger inside a grilled cheese sandwich, brilliant! I will definitely order that next time. 
The waiter was nice enough to give us a complementary sample of tiramisu for dessert as we were all too full from dinner. Even though I am not a big dessert person I really liked the tiramisu and would order it if I was hungry enough for dessert.

Overall I thought my dinner experience was good, but it still needs improvement which is understandable as this restaurant has only been open for less than two months with little business or publicity. Also there was only one person working the front of house -- he was the waiter and bartender for the entire restaurant when we were there which made for slow and spotty service, but he was very nice and courteous and greatly appreciated our patronage. An extra wait staff would definitely improve things.
I'm sure they will iron things out with their service as they get more customers and experience. I will definitely check back in a few months."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat not far from where we were staying after a long day of walking and a bike tour throughout downtown Toronto. During our search on yelp we found the Rustic King. After a quick look at the menu and the libations offered, we began our short walk over.

When you walk in you are greeted with long wood tables in the center of the dinning area with smaller tables to the sides for small groups of people.

After we were sat, we decided to choose three items from the menu to eat. The lamb sliders, a cheese board and the Cajun chicken.

The lamb sliders are absolutely amazing, I did not know until after I ate one and a half of them that each slider had different toping, I was so mad with myself that I missed out on chimichuri slider. However, the tzatziki slider and the goat cheese slider were some of the best lamb burgers I've had. Grilled to a light char with the center still juicy. The toping just added to the flavor. I kept looking at the board for more to appear. 

If you are in the area, do your taste buds a favor and stop in."}
