{"text":"I work near by at Wellington and university, which is about 5 minutes or less from the food court the restaurant is located. I have been to this restaurant many times despite the many options I have nearby. I always come back for their spicy fish and finger beef, their food is always fresh, tasty and inexpensive! Expect line-ups during lunch hour but they move really fast and it would be your turn to order before you know it. Not like some other snail-paced restaurants in the same food court. My friend is a vegetarian, and she always comes for their veggie combo. Me as the meat lover, always get the 2 meat combo and you will be surprised how much options they have. I briefly counted their menu once and they had around 25 items to pick from., buffet anyone? Anyway, enough said, definitely worth a try if you happen to be near by or if you want to venture out of your community during lunch time on weekdays. They are closed on weekends like other restaurants in the food court."}
{"text":"This is a great place for convenient Chinese food. They are less greasy. I feel more healthier."}
{"text":"Generic westernized Chinese food. But if  you're in the mood for such meals then this is pretty good choice by food court standards"}
{"text":"A very decent option if you're looking for Chinese takeout in the Financial District. The food here is fresh and tasty, and I don't have that greasy aftertaste after eating here, unlike some other Chinese takeout places in the area. I wouldn't go so far as to call it 'authentic' Chinese food but for what it is, it's pretty good.

$10 for a two meat combo with rices and veggies/salad is pretty reasonable in terms of price, and there is PLENTY of food. I ate from here today and will have enough for lunch tomorrow too."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced considering the location and the food is freshly made. The biggest issue is how little meat is provided when compared to similar food outlets (Wiki-hut, Schwan etc)."}
{"text":"This has to be the best fast food/ westernized Chinese that I've had. It's a few dollars more than most, but it's worth the premium.

Ordered the 2 meat/ 1 veggies/ noodle combo, which came out a little over $10 after tax. 

Big portions. I was stuffed (and I have a big appetite) 
Great taste
Fresh ingredients 

It's busy at lunch, but line goes really fast"}
{"text":"You're in Downtown. You're craving chinese food. Good. Let's go to EAT Canteen!

I found out this place on my first day here in Toronto, while casually strolling in the PATH (and getting lost, twice, obviously). I was hungry and it looked tasty so I said, yeah, why not.

Oh my goodness! This place is great! For like 7$ you get a huge serving of meat, veggies and either noodles or rice, which is pretty cool. I definitely wasn't hungry after!

It's probably not the best Chinese joint in town, but hell, it's great fast food and I will not be picky in a food court! Try it!"}
{"text":"I picked up take-away from Eat Canteen today and it was really good.  I had the noodles, broccoli and general tao chicken - yummy!!!  Service is quick, portions are big and prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"+ Tasty ginger beef and rice
-  Lines can be busy at lunch

This is a new chinese place in the Food Court.  It's pretty basic as far as menu options go.  A few combos, the standard being Combo #1 for $6.99 for one meat item, one veggie item, rice/salad/noodles. I chose the ginger beef with green beans and chicken fried rice.  All the food here looks pretty fresh and prepared well.  My green beans were crispy, rice had good flavor, and the ginger beef was perfectly spiced.

The lines at lunch, like most places here, can get a little long but they move along pretty fast at this place.  The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Everything here is so fresh and great! The staff are always pleasant. They count tofu as a veg, a lot of other places would charge more and consider that a meat. For about $8 you can get a meat, veg and rice or noodle, which is cheaper than most places in the path! Love their eggplant tofu and pineapple chicken!!!"}
