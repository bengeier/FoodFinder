{"text":"Lunch...Fresh. Ordered a sandwich, fresh bread that is light and fluffy with all the right condiments and options. 4.25 for a great sandwich that is fresh and quality ingredients. It is not busy because people are busy going to Tim Hortons or subway and this place is hidden. Very pleasent couple that were working there (probably the owners). Fresh, good service and insanely cheap. Strange it is not busier. It is old decor but it is a old bakery look that has not been updated.  If you need Italian tiles and granite counters to enjoy a meal, not the right place"}
{"text":"I had a few minutes in my lunch hour to spare so I ducked into this inviting little spot to try some of their European themed food. I ordered carrot cream soup and a white bun with butter. The bun melted in my mouth - so good and fresh. The soup was rich, tasty and SPICY! I wasn't expecting the cumin, and it warmed me nicely. I'd like to return for the perogies and/or cabbage rolls. The selection of pastry looked authentic including rum balls."}
{"text":"When interviewing for a job, they say the interviewer makes a decision in the first 5 seconds. First impressions are likewise important with food, I'm sorry but pastries and cookies sometimes just look good, and sometimes just don't. The presentation of pastries here was underwhelming, nothing \"looked\" good, and the decor was subpar (I'm not a big decor guy, but it does leave an impression).    Der Brokorb is a small tucked away bakery and sandwich place in Woodchester mall.  A selection of freshly baked breads ($3 per loaf) lines the wall behind the counter which has a small selection of pastries, homemade cookies and desserts.  I stopped by for breakfast, but not a whole lot looked especially appetizing. The only thing that quirked my interest was this chocolate almond cookie thing  ($1.50, see the picture), but it wasn't very tasty. There wasn't another person in the place, so I'm questioning whether turnover is a problem and how fresh the pastries are.   Individual apple pies ($3 each), homemade cookies ($3 per box) looked fairly average.  On the positive side of things, when I walked in through the door I was hit with the smell of freshly baking bread so maybe their breads are pretty good. I wouldn't mind trying a sandwich, but the pastries and cookies didn't leave a good impression.    Not much of a place for decor, had a few tables for sit down as they serve sandwiches and soups during lunch."}
{"text":"I work nearby and this place is a great option to pick up lunch... Quick, fresh, yummy and very cheap! They make their own bread daily and offer a variety of sandwiches and breads, I've had roast beef, turkey, and tuna salad... you can add cheese, lettuce, tomato, and condiments... $4.25 for a pretty decently sized (big!) sandwich. They also have 3-4 different types of soup every day, about $2 for a cup.  They offer breakfasts, hot foods for lunch, pastries and fresh loafs of bread, but I've only tried the soup & sandwich.  The place is very plain looking but I don't mind, I always take my food to go."}
