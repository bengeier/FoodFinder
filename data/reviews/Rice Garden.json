{"text":"Small little to-go place inside of Basha's.  It is set up similar to Panda Express where you either get rice or chow mein and pick your entrees.  Inexpensive and delicious.  About $5 for a 2-entree plate and $7 for a 3-entree plate.  I recommend it for take-out."}
{"text":"Not bad for something quick and convenient as you're leaving Basha's, but this place is far from tasty or delicious.  Food tends to sit for too long leaving dishes both luke warm and soggy.  Soup is watery and egg rolls are tasteless.  Panda express is far from fine dining and this place is several steps below that chain."}
{"text":"The Chow Mien has very little if any green onion, no celery, no carrots.  I have been there twice and they have run out of the barbecue chicken.  Also the fried rice on the hot line appeared to be from lunch being served during the dinner hour.  It used to be a better place to grab some take out, but since  the owners are not there they have some younger cooks who are not qualified to keep the trays full of fresh foods.  I might try them one more time, if I see no improvement I will find another place to take my business."}
{"text":"Food is great and the people working there are very nice. They always give me large portions and the entrees always taste fresh. Joe, one of their employees, is super nice and customer service oriented. I define fly recommend this place! Don't get turned off just because it's in a bashas supermarket, the food is great!"}
{"text":"Hello, 
We had just visited old town $$$$cottsdale, AZ for souvenirs. 
It was 97 degrees F. 
We were craving good inexpensive take out. 
My Garmin pointed out 
Rice Garden 
8035 East Indian School Road 
Scottsdale, AZ 85251-2617 
(480) 990-8801. 
I called and they gave me a list of entrees. I then inquired about price. 
They serve food with single, 2 and 3 combos. 
The 3 combos for less than $8.00. 
We drove to the address and found Basha's supermarket. 
I called and they stated that they were inside the supermarket. 
We entered the left entrance and turned right. 
They had the usual faire of Kungpow chicken, beef and brochili, fried rice, egg rolls, hot and sour soup, egg drop soup and chow mein noodles. 
We had the 3 combo with half/half rice and noodles, Kungpow chicken, Teriyaki chicken and BBQ pork and the 2 combo with fried rice, vegetable mix and spicy chicken mix with one large drink for less than $20.00. 
We drove back to our hotel and ate. 
The food was delicious. 
I will definitely return. 
Note: the prices are very,  very low. Quality is excellent. Cheap is a poor description.
Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"It's pretty much a Panda Express inside Bashas. If there's a line in front of you, expect to wait a while since there's only 2 workers and one cooks while the other gets food for you. The food's pretty standard American-Chinese takeout, nothing special there but nothing to complain too much about either. They're often out of food though, so you may have to wait a bit before they restock it or you have to get something else.

The good news is that they send out buy-one-get-one coupons pretty often in the mail so it's pretty cheap if you split it with someone or save the other combo for lunch the next day. Personally I'd never go there if I didn't have a coupon with me though."}
{"text":"Planned on a family lunch at The Red Herring but it was unfortunately closed due to some sort of emergency. Went to the Illini Union instead since we did not have much time to eat. From the poor restaurant selection in the Union, three of us chose Rice Garden and ordered the lunch special -- one entree, rice, an egg roll and a soda. However, when we ordered we were told that the only rice we could have was the white rice, not the fried rice and that although teriyaki chicken was there, it was not included in the lunch special. Two of us had kung pao chicken, the other orange sesame chicken.

Portions of the entree were small. The food, regrettably, was bland. My wife said nothing about her sesame chicken and the kung pao I had was flavorless and had none of the heat usually associated with the dish.

Bland food, small portions, and menu items excluded from the lunch special. Never again. If we had had a little more time we would have ventured into any one of several restaurants on Green Street which would have unquestionably provided us a better lunch."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood market.  The employees are all so considerate and kind.  They even know my family by name.  The produce is always spectacular and it's a joy to go in and see such happy faces everywhere you turn."}
{"text":"Rice garden inside basha's on Indian school rd is very good.  Dishes are hot & very fresh.  The volume of food they give u lasts for at least 2 or 3 meals, they DON'T stint.....  Zack is especially people friendly and always has a smile and is Eagar to serve u.  The prices are at least 1/3\"LESS than most Chinese restaurant's I have eaten at in the valley....   VERY GOOD!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for awesome atmosphere, heathy food & great service come here! Ideal for lunch or dinner. My wife on a recent trip to Scottsdale went 3 times in 4 days! Loved the fresh Salad & all the different subs. Awesome outdoor patio too"}
{"text":"Inside the Bashas is a secret- a good chinese restaurant. It is buffet style and you pack it up and go home, but it is bettter than the chain and cheaper!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Orange Chicken, but there is Little to no Chicken inside. Such a shame it use to love going there."}
{"text":"Convenient, that's good, but omg, loose the bitchy attitude!!! Don't lie and say your combo special side order doesn't count if I use a coupon. Don't bitch because I called you out on serving beef broccoli with 3 pieces of beef and 9 pieces of broccoli and dont offer  onine coupons if you don't want a customer to use one. Lose the attitude, lady. Ordering with you shouldn't be painful. I only shop with you because you are lucky to be located in my supermarket!  Your food ain't that great. But hey, $5 coupon. Just saying."}
{"text":"The line to get food was long. Very disorganized but worth the wait the food was great!! Will go back! I travel so it was nice to get good food and then get some snacks in the grocery store."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to cheap Chinese spot for years. I loved how their food was similar to panda express but cheaper and tastier. Unfortunately now the quality has gone down, maybe there was a change in management or something (there used to be mostly Asian workers, now it's all white teenagers who are literally the slowest people on earth when it comes to putting your food in a box omg). The last time I went there the chow mein was mushy and flavorless, the orange chicken was drowning in sauce, and the fried rice just tasted off. Guess I'll have to find a new Chinese takeout spot."}
{"text":"It's ghetto. Not fabulous. 

Certainly not ghetto fabulous. I've been here a couple times, but a heads up...it is the Chinese joint inside Basha's. 

Think of this as a Panda Express type establishment. Same concept. Start with either rice or noodles, and get a couple heaping scoops of some sort of chicken, beef or shrimp dish. 

It's not the worst place in the world, but certainly not the best. I find the food to be less greasy than a Panda. Thank God. 

Also, they tend to bring in a couple of random dishes from time to time. I once had the glass noodles, it was quite good.

Again, this isn't the best or worst place in the world. If you happen to be in the area and feel Asian for some reason, this is an ok choice."}
{"text":"What a complete ripoff.  Obviously I should've checked my box before I got home.  I ordered a single entree of Orange Chicken with steamed rice.  Well I had tons of rice in the box, maybe 20 cents worth in food cost and all six tiny chunks of Orange Chicken, maybe 40 cents in food cost.  Wow....Paid $7.00 for a half pint of steamed rice and maybe 1oz of chicken...Never Again!!!!"}
{"text":"Nasty!!!! Never will I try this place again. Rice was barely cooked and customer service sucks! I should have known not to go from the way the guy talked to me on the phone. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Id like to give this zero stars, I ordered the combo BBQ pork and kung pao chicken..The worse stuff I ever put in my mouth...it was greasy and had no flavor! terrible food...never going back"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food! The Thai noodles are my official new favorite noodles. A little bit pricey but for the taste, worth it for quick Chinese food."}
{"text":"Got a coupon in the mail for bygo. Showed the coupon to the employee prior to ordering to make sure it was valid. Employee said it was. We ordered two dinners and when we paid the coupon wasn't processing in their system. The employee apologized for the coupons not working, but still wouldn't honor them after I mentioned she said they were valid. Paid for the food and not a big deal just a little annoyed. The food was horrible though. We eat a lot of Asian food and this by far was the worst. The sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken tasted like frozen supper marked chicken. The crab rangoons were definitely previously frozen, and still cold in the middle, and the egg rolls tasted like paper. I had the worst upset stomach after, but I guess I shouldn't of expected much for Asian fast food. Next time I'll just order from a real Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Food's pretty good. Tastes different from Panda Express, though not necessarily worse. In fact I sometimes prefer Rice Garden's flavor.

Service, on the other hand, is poor and has only gone down over the years, as have the portion sizes. Employees are incredibly stingy about the quantity of food they will serve you. Often, in a serious customer service faux pas, they'll take food off your plate after they've already served it, apparently after deciding that your serving size is one piece of chicken too much. Come on, really?!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. When I miss moms home cooked Meals, this is the go to place! And they give you large portions!! 
I recommend the pork, chicken, and the rice noodles!
Staff is always very friendly as well.
Very convenient since it is in Bashas."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place, but it has taken a nose dive in quality in last few years."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worse Chinese I've EVER had!!! Food is cold and not good at all!! And the service is BAD!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and the lady is really nice !  She always says hello when i pass by.  I Recommend to everyone.   :)"}
{"text":"I ordered this through door dash. I didn't get my second order of crab Rangoon and the BBQ chicken meat was disgusting. Way to much fat. I kept having to spit pieces out it was so bad. The fried rice was dried out to the point that the peas were like leather.

Never again!"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed 

Rice Garden is located inside the Bashas shopping cente and is similar to Panda Express, you 
 Select premade entrée's items .  

I have to admit Chiense Food is one of my favorites and I have eaten a lot of Chinese food over the years of varying quality. However, Rice Garden is one of  the worst Chiense eateries I have ever come across.

 The Beef and Broccoli was inedible. The beef was overcooked and very fatty and the broccoli was undercooked. My second entree selection was Orange Chicken, and it wasn't any better. The Orange Chicken was soggy and bitter. The steamed rice was just that steamed rice, however,  even the rice was a little on the gooey side. 

I wasn't expecting the best Chinese meal I have ever eaten, and I definitely was not expecting one of the worst."}
{"text":"Fast food is rarely going to be epic.  Tonight was my first time eating there in a LONG time.  The staff was nice.  7 bucks for 2 entrees and some spring rolls was a pretty good deal.

The spicy chicken was overall good.  Overall the batter was crispy, though a few pieces were not.  The spring rolls were mediocre.  They were not the worst I've ever had, but I've had better.  The lo mien tasted doey like it wasn't all the way cooked or something.  

To be honest, there are better places out there, but if you're in a pinch and hankering for chinese it's better than nothing.  The chicken and the service saved what otherwise would have been a 1 * rating."}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious food, much better side options than Panda Express and the owners are appreciative. Good value for the money."}
{"text":"The closer to dinner time you go, the better the food (5-7). If you go after 7pm or so the chicken is pretty dried out from sitting under those lamps and can taste like beef jerky. We've learned 6pm is when you get the food fresh, & when it's fresh, it's GREAT. Otherwise, a let down. Choose your meal at prime lunch or dinner time & you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Fast, excellent food, great counter staff. As good as any regular Chinese place. Zack (I think that's his name) who works the front counter is friendly and helpful. Wish they had a tip-jar for him, as he's pretty hard working. Whenever I'm in the area (maybe 1-2 times a month) in late afternoon I always stop by and get the Family Feast to take home for dinner. Wife and kids love it."}
{"text":"Great food if I had to choice between this or panda I would choose this I would recommend this to anyone who looking for something to eat at cheap price"}
{"text":"Horrible, seriously worst Chinese business I've been too, very disappointed! I had a coupon and young lady was very rude. Made us feel extremely stupid and couldn't understand her! Highly recommend any other place than this. Had to wait on food and didn't feel important at all. I will not be giving my money to this place again."}
{"text":"Girl behind the counter was worthless. With one person In front of me I managed to wait 15 minutes without even being acknowledged before finally walking out. Their mediocre food wasn't worth the wait. Fine dining is faster than this place."}
{"text":"HELLO GROCERY STORE CHINESE PLACE!!  OK, so this sounds weird, right?  I thought it was strange when I saw the mini-restaurant inside Basha's.  Normally you see an overused Subway or McDonalds, or at least back in North Carolina that is completely expected.  A Chinese place would be next door in the shopping mall, but not in the grocery store.  WASSSSUP BASHA'S!!  You have created a masterpiece.  Fresh Chinese with Chinese workers, yea, I'd say it's fabulous.  I could have eaten an entire plate of rice alone.  It was that good.  I also ordered the orange chicken and the spicy chicken (general tsao's), which were exceptionally good too.   If you like Chinese food and if you enjoy saving money, I highly suggest Rice Garden.  Your taste buds will thank you later."}
{"text":"Food is bland, chewy, and lukewarm. Staff unfriendly and only want to get you out of their hair. This is across three different experiences. I thought I'd give it a third chance because of its convenient location. I won't give it a fourth."}
{"text":"This place is awful! The lady who is there a majority of the time is RUDE, RUDE, RUDE and VERY  skimpy with the portions.  I paid close to $7.00 for dried out noodles and a spoonful of Kung Pao chicken (see picture). I am beyond disappointed that I didn't go to Panda Express instead which was my first inkling,  but figured since I was at Bashas, why not? So I send my son to get my food while I am checking out, get home, open the box, and all I can say is \"they ought to be ashamed of themselves!!!\" When I called to complain,  the lady was uber RUDE and did not care.  Based upon my experience,  this place is a definite no go. If I could give them 0 stars, I would!"}
{"text":"It's kind of odd that a Chinese place in Bashas is worth writing a review about...but I have to say, it is delicious. I haven't had any Chinese food around here that I've really loved but one day I had a coupon for this place and decided to check it out. It's dirt cheap- with or without a coupon, and you get a TON of food. I think it's something like 6 bucks for 2 entrees and fried rice. Also, you will be in and out of Bashas in under 5 minutes. Seriously, they are really fast. Orange chicken is the bomb. Be prepared for leftovers or plan on getting this when you really wanna pig out."}
{"text":"They get 2 stars only because of excellent service, Mai was great.  The food though... Let's talk food.  It wasn't good.  I can't find one good thing to say about that.  The rice was very dry and the noodles undercooked.  They no longer have lemon chicken  but even worse....(did I mention it wasn't good?) The chicken in the Kung Pao chicken tasted like an ashtray, that's the only way to describe it.  So I tried the mushroom chicken and same thing.  I admit I threw it all out...I couldn't do it not even if it meant wasting $10."}
{"text":"If you sign up for email offers from The Rice garden you get really great coupons that make it very inexpensive to get a lot of food. The quality is ok even though the selection is limited
Try to get their around noon or around 5 because that is when food is the freshest."}
{"text":"This fast-food Americanized Chinese cuisine wants to be as good as Panda Express. And I'm saying that knowing full well that Panda Express isn't that great either. The convenience factor (buying a quick to-go meal in the grocery store) is the biggest draw of this establishment.

Cafeteria-style serving, the food is generally not very hot, the portions are small for an extremely high price ($8+ for a 3-item entree consists of a small scoop of each of your entrees and not that much rice, either), and the staff is often rude. If you question the portion size, they'll add a little more and say something in another language to whoever's in the back that usually elicits laughter. I don't mind people communicating in their preferred language, but the timing and the laughter makes me uncomfortable.

I used to be a big fan of this place, until the pricing went up and the portions went down - along with the service. They charge extra for shrimp or BBQ pork ($1.50 upcharge why? - the items aren't that special). The worst part was that the next day the leftovers made me incredibly sick (after being stored in the fridge and reheated properly) which did not happen on previous trips. 

Skip Rice Garden even if you're in Bashas' and hungry - there's a few other places in the strip mall and a freezer section in the grocery store. They're not open very late, the food is likely to not be hot enough anyway, and the price does not reflect the quality."}
{"text":"When I am in the mood for Chinese takeout and pressed for time (a case of food poisoning which sent me to the hospital keeps me from stepping foot inside a Panda), I head to Rice Garden inside Bashes. 

Open at 11am, I know I can quickly head over, grab lunch, and get back to work within 15 minutes. My order is usually the same every time - Rice Noodles, Lemon Chicken, and BBQ Pork! 

They have a free combo punch card, buy 9 combos and get a Free 2 item combo on your next visit. 2 more punches and HELLO free Lemon Chicken and BBQ Pork!!! 

Now, back to work and my lunch from Rice Garden!! YUM!"}
{"text":"Love BBQ pork !!!"}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful--wish I could give zero. Just tried to have lunch from this place and am regretting. Used to be good, their lemon chicken was the best. Now I don't know what has happened. The side of rice noodles used to be great, now they pretend angel hair pasta is made from rice...no, it's just pasta. Each time I tried to eat a piece of the Fusion Chicken I had to spit it out, super stringy and fatty. Disgusting. Don't eat here it is terrible."}
{"text":"Located inside Bashas, this \"Panda Express\" fast food clone offers decent Chinese food. The food usually looks pretty fresh anytime of the day or night. 

There is extra charge for certain items, like Lemon Chicken or the BBQ meats. 

It's a bit on the pricey side...2 item combo was almost $8 bucks??? WTH? I could had grabbed a whole roasted chicken or an oven baked Large Cheese Pizza from the Bashas Deli for $5!!!

Make sure they don't charge you an extra .50 cents in addition to the \"additional BBQ\" price...I wonder how many other customers they are doing this to that didn't notice they were being overcharged, bad business practice!

There's another fast food Chinese place across the street called \"Chop-Chop\" or a really good sit-down Chinese place next door, \"Tasty-Asian\" if you want other Asian options."}
{"text":"Food has always been fresh and soooooo good !!! I love the orange chicken and chicken and mushroom... eggrolls better than spring rolls ... spring rolls are mushy :( .. they hook up the plates to go !!"}
{"text":"Not very good... I ordered the 2 item combo with fried rice, orange chicken, and teriyaki chicken for $6.80 after tax.  For my $6.80 I got small 1 cup portions of some overly salty orange chicken and bland teriyaki chicken (all of which was low quality meat) and a hefty portion of cold (okay... maybe not cold, but it definitely wouldn't qualify as warm) fried rice.  Overall this place is way less than mediocre foods at relatively high prices.  I'd say avoid this place and go to Cravings just a block away!"}
{"text":"It's convenient to grab something quick for dinner on your way out of Bashas. It's really a great value for your money too. I like just about everything here but especially the egg drop soup and the fried rice."}
{"text":"Convenient that this place is inside a Bashas. Surprisingly, this place is pretty good, service isn't. The orange chicken and chow mein are my favorite items. Place is affordable, too."}
{"text":"This is the second time in a row I didn't get credit, points, for my purchase and I purposely pointed out the points credit. The lady simply crumpled up my information card and when asked where my information card was and did she give me points credit she said \"next time\". 

There will never be another next time. Hell they can't even do it right this time!!

You gotta be kidding...WONT BE BACK, poor poor poor customer service!!!!!


07-17-15 update
Corporate office was contacted and responded appropriately. I hope this employee will become a better customer service rep. Thank you Corporate office. Wish your firm all the good will and success."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken I've ever had! Favorite Chinese food place in the Old Town Scottsdale area"}
{"text":"Good food ,good portions my favorite Asian restaurant not pricey orange chicken the best"}
{"text":"We have had very good food and service here. They cook small batches so the food in the trays always looks fresh, sometimes you even have to wait a minute or two as food is being replenished often. The BBQ pork is very good, and we have no problem eating gluten-free here. There is a lot of competition in the area, and we have found this to be consistent and convenient for take-home food."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! I've had Chinese thought the globe and I'd say this is pretty darn good for something where it's quick. My most favorite Chinese would be in NJ and NY area but this one is not too bad. The server is always friendly and fast. Just point at what you want and you're good to go!  I've only had chicken, pork bbq, Thai noodles, fried rice, orange chicken and they've been very good. I did, however, disliked the cream puffs. They were kind of chewy. I'll come back for more and I suggest to others to give it a try!"}
