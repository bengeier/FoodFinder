{"text":"Food is good but the service is horrible. Employees eating wings as they are cooking them... I had to wait 15 minutes over my expected time only to find out that my order was just sitting there.. Apparently too busy stuffing their own faces to call out my name.."}
{"text":"Whaatt??  why does this place have a single dollar sign to indicate their pricing?  this is NOT inexpensive.  Firstly.. if you have tables for people to dine in, why are there no napkins on the table? It's a wing joint..people need napkins, unless you're a neanderthal.  Second..no wetnaps? Every wing place in town has wetnaps available.  Next on the list? if your establishment isn't set to close for a few more hours, and you have patrons sitting at tables, that's a pretty inopportune time to go deckscrub the bathroom floors.  I wanted to go and wash my hands (since all you get is crappy paper towels and no wetnaps) but the cashier that helped us initially (who also wanted our name as we walked in the door and before we even placed an order).. was busy scrubbing away at the women's room floor... with posted hours of a midnight close time. I get wanting to get sidework and cleaning done early, but restrooms should be available if you have people still sitting in your tables.  Wait till everyone's gone to do that.. or better yet, wait till closing time.   We were not wholly impressed with paying 24 dollars for two 8pc combos and a side of veggie sticks (again, no place in town charges for carrots and celery, regardless).. It's a shame though, because the wings were good.  Wait times are horrible, though.  18 minutes even when you're slammed is too long. The only thing I can think of is that their kitchen guy isn't able to handle multiple orders of deep fried items.  Definitely not going to be back.  Not worth the money you spend there."}
{"text":"Horrible service DONT GO to this location on Decatur and Tropicana they are horrible. I got wing with no season on them. And fries the were size of peas. Then I give them another chance. I get off work put I. A order drive out my way I get there. And They have no idea about my Order!!! Funny! so I say I called here.. then call the number again. Guess who answer the girl on the register next to me.. ha ha bullshit. I eat wing stop 1 a week and this location make wing stop look like amateurs!"}
{"text":"I give up on this location worst customer service from julio on back to back to back visits always gives an attitude like it isn't his job to take my order and get it correct if you're in the mood for wingstop i recommend the one on Maryland good customer service the place is a lot bigger or just go to buffalo wild wings really. (to julio if anyone from wingstop reads this please inform) better attitude with customers our money pays your bills if you are not happy making low income and living at moms please find another job don't take it out on us"}
{"text":"The skin of the wings were rubber texture and not good.  Took a bite and literally spit it out.  Threw the rest away.  There are several other places that have much better wings and wings are not there top menu item.  Not sure how this place is still in business..."}
{"text":"OK...I'm not a real connoisseur of chicken wings, and I probably wouldn't choose to eat at a wing joint of my own volition. That being said, Wingstop gets a three and a half.  The wings are excellently crispy--a must for tasty chicken wings that B-Dub's consistently falls flat on.  Good sauces: the BF and I got atomic, and the awesome new mango haba√±ero.  Lots of napkins required.  The place has a definite starving-college-student vibe, which is not my scene...but the place was clean and bright.  As far as wingerias go, this gets thumbs up."}
{"text":"A new Wingstop, awesome service fantastic wings Julie is the general manager she has great customer skills."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is everything is made 
fresh no heat lamps no microwaves just hot fresh wings and hand cut fries. Service is friendly and welcoming. The price is right compared to other places"}
{"text":"I walked in and was greeted by Melvin, he asked if I needed help understanding the menu? I let him know it was my first time in. He let me know how the menu read, and I made my order with no confusion. (The combo numbers equate to the #of wings you get in the combo) 
Easy enough.... He gave me a first time vist discount also...  After I received my meal he asked and made sure all was good with the meal. Even came and cleaned up after I was done, didn't wait till after I left, and asked if their was anything else I needed... The filling was,  I was at a full service restaurant? Most important the wings were very good not over cooked (hard and dry).
Very good experience there at this particular Wingstop on W Thunderbird and N 59th ave.
Don't know if all wingstops are like this one!

He would fit right in, in my line of business, as well as any other busines owner would say. Bty the other person working with Melvin was equally customer service oriented. Wingstop hold on to Melvin he is very valuebale!!

{"text":"If you love chicken wings, then this is the place to go!
They make your wings fresh right when you order it.
I always get the Lemon pepper and garlic parmesan chicken wings.  I usually ask for some hot sauce on the side to dip my garlic parmesan in. 

Everytime I go in, its not very busy at all.  I always get my wings within 15 minutes.  

Now that I'm writing this review, I think i'm going to go there tonight to get some wings."}
{"text":"I like it when people i am ordering from are friendlly. One girl at the counter was very rude and the place seems to be pinching pennies. They do not give out water or ranch with the order which was the first let down. So i spent 2 dollars for water and 89 cents for ranch (bummer) it's not the money... it's the point of good service if you order hot wings they should include sauce with the order and charge more not make me add it on .... The girl at the front was rude and kept answering my questions with attitude all the while my Togo took 30 minutes (another bummer). The sauces are good but the manager and food chain needs to have a talk with the people who work at this location (one girl impaticular) As well as including ranch in my order.   

On a side note only 1 girl was rude but 2 others made up for it at the end. The wings were also really good which is why I'm changing from 2 stars to 3. Drink machine was also a plus"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, they got my order wrong. Luckily I checked before I got to far. The lady on the phone doesn't under stand English. Poor service bad wings nothing like Bay Area wingstop more pricier less quality dry like Nevada desert"}
{"text":"I will not eat wings from anywhere else, I love Wingstop so much. Lemon pepper and Teriyaki wings are so yummy. Me and my family always order the family pack which has 35 wings, large fries, veggies and dips for a good price."}
{"text":"I enjoy wing stop and even more at this location. Great customer service, food is done in a great time and always clean."}
{"text":"i ate at this wing stop and just a few wings into my meal i got noxious and light headed, so i went outside to get some air. as soon as i stepped outside i threw my food up.with vomit on me i went home and showered. by the time i called they had already closed for the day so i called the next day to inform them of what happened and that id like a refund and that the wings could be bad only to have lilly the manager brush me of like i was trying to scam them and not paying much attention the to telling her about a possible food contamination,till this day there has been no resolution ...                                                                                                                                   wow, im updating this to inform  that the owner called me and basically said i was wrong and that there is nothing wrong with the food! THE OWNER HERSELF!!! im sure she was in that kitchen that night and oversaw the entire shift to be able to call me and inform me that there is no way the food was maybe handled improperly or maybe the oil was changed daily, unreal!! i would never recommend this place to anyone, if you have an unpleasant time or maybe even food poisoning(as i did) there will be no solution or maybe a sad(insulting) attempt at it .."}
{"text":"Food here is usually pretty good but the service sucks. When something was wrong with my order the guy at the counter seemed to busy texting than helping me out. Probably won't be coming back here after that experience."}
{"text":"I get to Wingstop about once a month, as there are not many fast, casual restaurants in N Las Vegas where I feel comfortable eating alone. I usually get a 10 piece boneless wings with the garlic and tangy barbecue flavors. The boneless wings run the gauntlet from big, juicy pieces to small, gristly pieces, and you never really know what you are going to get. I like the french fries, but again, there is very little consistency in quality. I never know if I am going to leave happy or hungry. 

I will continue to rotate my eating out at Wingstop, as the food is good when the quality is there."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I continue to come to this place is because it's literally around the corner from my house and I've always loved the wings. But their inability to complete an order with the time frame given is soooooo frustrating. I'm in their restaurant as I write this. I made an online order with a 30 minute time frame. My order would be ready by 130. I arrived a few minutes late. I ended up still waiting another 30 minutes for my order. Funny enough there was another gentleman there as I was paying complaining about the same thing. I've refrained many times from writing a negative review about this place. But come on. EVERY TIME, EVERY SINGLE TIME. This seems to be a common complaint from numerous customers posting on Yelp. Isn't it time to rally your team together and make some changes?!?!?"}
{"text":"Invest in some real napkins and wet naps you cheap bastards.  Take the music programming seriously (I'm not 12 and either are most of the people paying).  Stop drenching your wings in sauce that tastes like its from a bottle.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience here. The sauces are all at least good tasting (some of them a bit thick for my tastes), my favorite being the Atomic. Haven't actually had the bone-in chicken wings, but between the tenders and the boneless wings, the tenders are definitely my favorite. 

This seems like they may use a higher caliber of chicken (or maybe just cook it better) than some of the other wing places, because their boneless wings definitely seem juicier and less stringy than some of the other wing places on Carson. The breading is great, too - just the right amount of crunch, not too thick, and not too floury. They manage to get the chicken to stay crispy despite being doused in sauce, something not too many places seem to get right for boneless wings.

The interior of the restaurant isn't much to talk about; just a counter where you order your food, then a seating area where you can wait for them to bring it out. We placed an online order for carry-out last time and it worked perfectly, phone ordering is an option as well.

Delivery would be the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"it's been a while since my last time visit this place (when they still have that 50Cents each wing deal) honestly, this place is pretty price. and sometimes the wings they serve a so TINY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Jesus, last time i got a few pieces boneless wings they are the size of a quail egg!!! i mean srsly, i just need bigger wings! wat can i say, im a meat lover. heeheee :p"}
{"text":"I dont know if someone at the location hates my love of cheese, but when ever my fat self orders cheese fries, they always forget the cheese. Dont do delivery. They'll forget something. If you takeout, make sure to check your items."}
{"text":"I always take the wings here to-go. This branch here in The Santa Fe is closest to my house, and I've always had a good experience ordering from here. Usually when I come in though, it's not busy, so I can't attest much for the quality during busy hours, but I never have had issues from the food. The other reviews I've read about this location give it an average rating, so perhaps the dine-in and take-out quality is different? I will keep coming back, due to the convenience and my experiences here. I don't like eating in casino food courts anyways, so I'll keep carrying-out. Friendly staff. Great wings."}
{"text":"Literally didn't believe all the stuff people wrote about day of Super Bowl w/ the service being that terrible. But no, now I believe it. I am so infuriated and I haven't even left the cashier to start telling you about how negative my experience here was! Girl was literally hiding in the bathroom to not have to work. Other lady who was at the front cashier was very unhelpful and had to call her manager for anything I asked for and very unprofessional. Laughing at nothing while I was ordering. Manager seemed very inadequate to run the place properly, and was seen bouncing around from kitchen to lady's bathroom to yell through the door to ask if his employee was alright and why she wasn't coming out. hope that tells you enough about how this place is run."}
{"text":"Great location better than other wingstops beer on tap, more than two tvs (big tvs not small), great customer service(katie is the best), big dine-in area, and food is delicious compliments to the cooks definitely my favorite wingstop to go to"}
{"text":"Just called to place a phone order and the lady that answered burped on the phone and laughed about it right before taking my order. Didn't even get her name because she was having side conversations and laughing while attempting to take my order the whole time. We also saw an ad on the wingstop website which she was not willing to honor for us. I ended up just canceling my order because the service was completely terrible and the employee who answered the phone was rude and didn't care to help us at all."}
{"text":"Bad experience first visit but decided to try again. Very good customer service this time and my food tasted fresh and properly cooked this time."}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars i would. 1 star is too many. My and my sister went here today. We made a phone call order. I spoke with this lady who must of been new because she had no idea what the hell she was doing. Like WHY PUT SOMEONE NEW ON THE PHONE? Anyways. i specifically told her the order was separate and she still made it all together. But wait theres more. Everytime i go to the location on  dunlap they never give me a hard time when i want to upgrade my drink to a large. But this lady made it seem like it was a huge deal and that the system didnt allow her to. So instead of just giving me 1 large drink she rang me for two. AFTER i paid for everything she then decided to tell me that she rang me for the two larges . but wait THERES MORE. after we were waiting for like 5 mins there was one of the employees sitting next to the bathroom on her phone talking to her long lost sister or something . Just being so loud and obnoxious. I had the WORST experience here. NEVER in ur life come here. I live 10 miles away from this location and i am willing to drive another 10 just for better service. Get your shit together Thunderbird. Hire employees employees that arent just on there phone. maybe youll get more customers ."}
{"text":"Wing stop chicken is delicious as always, but the service at this location is awful. Tried to call in an order and was put on hold for 10 min. When the employee finally answered, she asked if I could continue holding, I was going to tell her that I was already near the location so it didn't matter but she didn't even wait for a reply before the holding music was playing again. Super rude! When we walked inside there were 3 employees at the register only 2 people in line, only one employee on the phone, no reason why I should've been on hold for that long. Multiple customers kept coming up to the counter with their orders wrong and the employee that took my order had to re-enter my order on the computer 3 times before she got it right. Just an overall unfriendly staff, but no disrespect to the cooks. I've never been unhappy with the food here, just the rude service that never changes."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Called to place and order and was asked to hold for a moment I was on hold for 25 minutes no one came back and after 15 minutes of holding they picked up and hung up"}
{"text":"Deplorable...Horrible service. Sucked, big time for me to even consider taking time out of my schedule to write this review. (I never write reviews!)

Tried to call in an order and was literally placed on hold for over 15 minutes. I purposely waited patiently thinking, \"Ok, they must be busy. Someone will pick up and courteously ask me to remain on hold for a bit longer.\" NO, didn't happen. Not even once. 

I hung up and called right back, and before I could greet her again I was getting ready to be automatically placed on hold again until I yelled out, \"Wait! I've already been on hold for 15 minutes. Can you please just take my order real quick. I know what I want. It's simple.\" Angela said she was the only one there with a line out the door. Well, if she had taken my order over the phone within the first 5 minutes of holding, or told me that they couldn't take phone orders at that time, I could have driven over & had my food within the same time frame that I was placed on hold. She wanted to place me on hold for another 15 minutes until she got her line taken care of. WTH!

They need to have more cashiers during rush hour or close phone hours during that time. Something has to give in the name of Customer Service. How many orders did they miss by not having someone there to take phone orders only during rush hour, 5pm on a Monday? Many!

As far as food...
Tried the Atomic Hot, and those are just ridiculously hot for no reason. No flavor...just way beyond habanero spicy, like they picked every possible super spicy herb & said \"Just throw it on there\". Sauce dropped on my arm and literally whelped my skin. Even my finger tips burned from the sauce. o.O No Bueno!

Tried the Chile Lime...tastes like they just used Taco Seasonings with a splash of lime. They were okay, but I was in the mood for chicken wings, not tacos. Palette was confused.

I guess the best thing to do is to Keep It Simple...Lemon Pepper & Original Hot...Plus choose a location that has better customer service. Which means, I probably won't be eating Wingstop anytime soon because I'm not driving across town to another location. My hubby's homemade Lemon Pepper & Hot Wings are AWESOME! We just didn't feel like greasing up the kitchen this evening."}
{"text":"DON'T DO IT!

Let me save you the wasted time and dinning dollars

Every Sunday our family has what we call \"hot wings Sunday\". Normally we order take out from Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub & Restaurant, on Camelback Road but because of the storm this weekend they lost powers and were not serving food as a second choice I called Long Wongs but they weren't answering their phones so as a last choice I called Wingstop hoping against my better judgement that the food might be ok. 

Our normal order is 20 med, 10 BBQ and 6 hot. Because their wings only come on orders of 10 we ordered 40 wings at $33. In my book that's pretty steep for wings. Imagine my surprise when I arrived home and discovered with much disappointed that our order did not come with ranch, blue cheese or even a single sliver of celery - REALLY? Wingstop???  Sauce and veggies are considers extra sides? PATHETIC! 

Now as far as the quality of the food- it's glorified fast food- and that's probably too nice. I would put it in the ranks of McDonald's- it's terrible!

The wings were greasy and tasted terrible. Soggy chicken skin with a flavorless buffalo sauce. The boneless wings were bad too- it's about what you would find in a grocery store quick serve hot food section. I expect more from an establishment that calls its self a restaurant. 

Save yourself the disappointment- DON'T GO THERE!

Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub
Long Wongs
Even Streets the of New York (while not my favorite) all have real hot wings worth eating."}
{"text":"The best wings in Charlotte!! Louisiana rub flavor to die for. It is a dry rub creole oil based seasoning that will make your lip smacking!! They have fresh cut fries everyday. Do not forget their 50 cents boneless wings on Monday and Tuesday!"}
{"text":"I ordered online it said 23 minutes the order was placed at 7:15 pm I arrived to pick up my order 25 minutes later and they haven't even started cooking my meal yet. So 10 minutes later I'm still here wtf I have things to do smh."}
{"text":"Love the wings and French fries, but don't come after 5pm otherwise you'll most likely get the worst customer service you've ever received. I can understand the frustration of working fast food, but when I have to greet them first to make them even look at me it's a little ridiculous"}
{"text":"Ate inside. I was quoted 11 min from when I ordered. 25 min later I asked about my order and she brought it to me. Wings weren't hot anymore (temperature). 

I saw the wings finished sitting in the kitchen and nobody was doing anything. 

Won't return."}
{"text":"Food wasnt that great. Everytime I come here the quality of food and taste keeps getting worse. Nothing beats canes"}
{"text":"Food was good but,  I asked for a band aid and the employers said that they didn't have any. I've been In the food and beverage industry for 4 years and I'm pretty sure it's  health code to have band-AIDS and or a health kit In the kitchen. I'm was just baffled that they didn't have any. I'm pretty confident that the lady was lying to me. All I need were 2 band aids."}
{"text":"Got real bad food poisoning!

On a visit to Las Vegas I stopped here for 10 lemon pepper wings, fries and beans.  Later that night I started feeling the chills and ended up vomiting 9 times and had multiple rounds of diarrhoea throughout the night. Was bed ridden and severely dehydrated the next day.  I hadn't eaten anything else prior to arriving at Wingstop other than some fruit. A friend I was with had also come down sick too.  I have a strong stomach but this experience really left me not wanting to come back. Buffalo Wild Wings it is!  I won't be coming back. 

On a side not, the raspberry-lime juice was very good."}
{"text":"I kind of get the impression that the other two reviews were written by friends of the establishment, because I do not share their sentiments at all. Every now and then I get cravings for wings. And I'm talking standard, blue-collar, messy, ready to be dipped in bleu cheese chicken wings. I got excited when I moved to the area a few months ago and noticed a location called \"wing stop\", thinking I had found my home. Unfortunately, a friend that was with me shared the same underwhelming feeling that I did. 

When you walk in, the place has the feel of the bad chains you see in airports. The menu is limited, and kind of odd in the sauce and choices, and this is a wing place that charges extra for extra sauce, carrots, and celery. I mean, who charges for celery (except hooters, and that's a whole other rant)? The wings were, however, made to order, so despite an apprehensive first impression we were still optimistic. 

The first sight of the wings didn't prove to be a turn in the right direction, they were pretty standard, maybe even a little undersized...kind of disappointing for the wing stop, you know? The flavor and taste was good, but nothing more special than that $4 dozen you can get at the vine on Tuesday's (ahhh college memories). These were standard bar fare appetizer wings at quality wing prices. The fries that came with them were probably the best part, so needless to say, I'm glad I satisfied my curiosities but will not be returning. 

I don't write reviews to bash an establishment, but felt I needed to add my opinion, because the first two seem very misleading compared to the experience I had."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this a 1 is for the customer service.  I ordered my wings well done extra crispy they are regular cooked.  The manager Amanda told me I have to bring the wings back to get any credit.  Lol i asked if I could eat a couple because this was my lunch driving to get them.  She said no if they are edible then they wouldn't credit me and all had to be returned. 

I love wing stop but her attitude I don't."}
{"text":"Awesome wings and cheese fries! Definitely better than Buffalo Wild Wings. I will never go back to BWW. This place has fast service and is small and cozy. Great customer service as well, the associate explained everything in detail when I went for the first time."}
{"text":"The best I can get living up north for wings. I wish they added more fries.... they are sooo good. And what's even better is I can order online and beat the wait when getting there on tues. Wings ain't that bad my fav is mild."}
{"text":"So happy they opened one up in the area, about time! Good wings, reasonable prices, good stuff!"}
{"text":"My first time to any Wing Stop. Menu confusing & most useless cashier(Nataly?) that I've ever dealt with. Complete blank stare from the her & doesn't help with the place being loud and she basically whispers. Disappointing to me was this same cashier looking at my customized debit card and then going & stopping the other workers to come look at my card. Uhhhh privacy issue? Quite a bit I'd say...have they never seen a dog in their life? Would appreciate my money back... Waited 49 mins for 8 wings and frys. Not to mention the cashier didn't give me my drink until I walked up and asked if I could get it before my order comes out, only 107 degrees outside and walk there from my job. Get back to work with my Togo order & my requested \"ketchup\" ended up being hot sauce that broke open and is over everything in my bag. Don't think I'll be back. 



Just tried for a second time because I was given $15 in gift cards. Still not impressed, even with technically free food. Disappointing"}
{"text":"Alright, I might be biased. 
But after my previous bad experience with another wing store, Wing Stop seem like the best thing anyone can have when craving wings. 
Friendly service, decent price (compare to other store, but not compare to frozen wings), great flavor. 
My first choice when it comes to wings!"}
{"text":"I like their fries! I like their wings!!
I am not a fast food/ chain restaurant type of person and have been trying to eat healthier. But, if I am craving wings, this is the place to get my craving satisfied! (Lemon pepper and garlic Parmesan are my favorite!!)"}
{"text":"These chicken wings are addicting. I've had them three times the past couple of weeks. I get the ten plain, because I'm not a huge fan of hot wings. They take a bit of time to cook fresh, so be patient or order online beforehand."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the service was horrible. The cashier forgot my name 3 times then people who ordered way after I did were somehow getting their food before me then when I finally get my order they didn't include my ranch that I ordered with the food and so now they want to recharge me for it.. never again will I come here"}
{"text":"Lexia charged me for everything separate instead of a package meal,  even the sauces and fries,20 wings instead of 24, the manager would not even come out to talk with me, Lorraine. Paid more for a lot less,  went to Pizza Hut for Wing Wednesday to make up for what I was shorted, then accidentally placed a great review for Pizza Hut here, trying to get removed."}
{"text":"I called to place an order and was placed on hold. Once someone got back on the phone she tells me to hold. I inform her I was already on hold & she hangs up on me. When I call back she doesn't even say anything once she answers the phone so I ask to speak to a manager. I explain to the manager what happened and she starts laughing. Then goes on to tell me \"we encourage people to place orders online\". It shouldn't matter how I place an order. Very rude and I will be reporting!"}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting a wingstop location in about a year. I was excited about this new location because it is close to my home. I orders a 6 piece mild wings with fries and a drink. The fries were warm and tasty just how I remembered. It took a long time to get our wings (about 20 min). When I did receive them they were cold and TASTELESS. I took them to the counter and expressed this to a worker who told me it was my fault for letting them sit when I literally took them back 2min after I got them. She was rude and refused to give me another order at first. She rudly took the plate and got me a new order. Not coming back again. Bad customer service"}
{"text":"Walked in around 12:45 pm for lunch  and was Greating a smile..( was not that Busy). I told them that i Never been to wings stop before that it was myfirst time and what would they recommened?  They offered combo with fires and drinks so I Had the Cajun Chicken Wings was very Good.....My friend Atomic -was very Hot spicy ( i could not eat that) ...:) All around was Good .... Only down Fall was they had NO garbage can anywhere...I watched a customers put there dirty tray on where we picked up our food. I dont think customers knows to leave there empty dirty tray on the table . 

Recommendation- put a garbage can out and you will have more clean table to seat on rather than a customer complaing to have someone clean the table. Within 10-15 minutes the place was busy, this must be a popular place ...:)"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, tried to phone in my order and was put on hold before I could even say a single word. Waited for 40 minutes with not a single word or anything being said and then they hung up on me. Called again same thing on hold for quite sometime. After over an hour on hold  while I was driving, i was already almost there at the store and decided to walk in and put in my order. Based on the time I was on hold I was expecting a line out the door, that was definitely not the case, I told the lady at the register about being on hold and all they said was wellll..... I put in my order anyways and waited almost an hour for 12 wings. I heard my name called once and walked up to the register and stood there aimlessly, being completely ignored for 5-10 minutes as the lady was standing right there. And she hands me my order that was just sitting there ready for me as if I wasn't waiting there right in front of her. On top of everything else there was another lady that walked in to order some food who said she was trying to call for the past 20 minutes to phone in an order and she was standing there completely ignored and once someone who finally approached her who wasn't even working the register who seemed to be the cook told her they were closed and aren't taking any more orders. She was standing there for at least 15 minutes and not a single word was said to her. Horrible customer service, need better staff who can handle the pressure of working Saturday nights. I love wingstop but I will never visit this specific store ever again I will gladly go out of my way to go somewhere else. If I could give them less than 1 star I would because they don't even deserve that just ridiculous."}

{"text":"My first time here, wings were excellent. The most recent time (yesterday) not so much. Skin was not crispy, but soggy. Not good. Fries had a good flavor but were not crispy either. Mango habanero wings were all sugar with no discernable habanero heat. Blue cheese dressing it less than optimal. Ranch dressing is excellent. We ordered with their online app and that was very, very good. Excellent way to order. But, when we arrived at about 6pm on Saturday night, the place was empty. That is always concerning. I wish the best for this place as it is an excellent concept and the flavors are really very, very good. They just need to stary focused in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love this location.  Went in yesterday, had ordered with the app earlier in the day.  Wings were hot and ready at the time I had requested.  Always get great, friendly service from this location"}
{"text":"We live close and have been here maybe about 6 times. Each time we ask them to cook our order well done and they never do. We heard one of the girls tell the cook in Spanish to not pay attention to the special instructions
We will now travel to another location just so we don't have to deal with the service at this site. We let It slide until always saying maybe because they were busy but after hearing her say that remark we realize that they have so much business they just don't care"}
{"text":"Horrible.. Horrific.. horrid..
Three words that describes my most recent visit to this establishment. Calling is a restaurant would give it way more credit than it deserves.
Over priced.. over cooked..
We called to complain and were told that even if we brought the wings back all we'd get is the wings replaced with more wings.
Yeah, as if I'd waste more gas just to get more awful \"food\".
 Refusing to refund a customer for wretched, burned up, tiny wings is ridiculous.
SO.. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE."}
{"text":"Food- Wings are delicious, but the chicken fingers were very salty...high blood pressure salty. 

Cleanliness - tile walls need to be cleaned, grout."}
{"text":"extremely poor service. have come here three times and orders are wrong every time but food tastes fine. Today order wasn't even close so manager (who had poor phone etiquette)said to bring food in to get it fixed. upon coming in manager proceeded to laugh and didn't understand the issue. continued to laugh at myself and my wife then took someeone else's order. Then he got cold wings put sauce on and handed them. Do not go here under any circumstances."}
{"text":"Quand je regarde des parties des Canadiens, souvent je me fais mes propres ailes de poulet. J'ai une excellente recette, et c'est rare que je vais en trouver des aussi bonnes ailleurs dans un restaurant. Chez Serge, un bar sportif √† Montr√©al, ils font des excellentes ailes de poulet, mais une seule vari√©t√©, qui n'est pas assez piquante √† mon go√ªt. 

Je n'aime pas les ailes de poussin trop cuites des Cages aux Sports; trop petites, trop cuites et les sauces ne sont pas assez go√ªteuses. 

Je n'aime pas plus les ailes des Buffalo Bill. 

Mais ici, chez Wingstop, les ailes sont EXCELLENTES. La qualit√© de la cuisson, la grosseur des ailes, le go√ªt des sauces, j'ai ADOR√â! Tellement que s'il y en avait un proche de chez moi, je ne m'en ferais plus, j'irais chez Wingstop. 

Donc si vous √™tes √† Las Vegas et que vous cherchez des ailes de poulet pas trop loin de la 'strip', c'est l√† place!"}
{"text":"First time ever at the wing stop and to me first impression is everything especially when it comes to my food. Three star greeting. Everyone looks too tired to work. I placed my order and waited for 20 minutes to get 7 boneless wings. Horrible! My mom showed up after me to place her order 4 minutes after me along with 2 other customers and they got their order before me. At that point I'm hangry. Never again. I rather go elsewhere. That's pitiful for a new restaurant."}
{"text":"For the most part, this place runs pretty smooth. Fast, easy & if you get addicted to their wings...ummm. Yummm"}
{"text":"If this was the first time something ridiculous happened at this location it wouldn't be as bad... But honestly, this seems to be an ongoing thing where their registers have issues and it cannot be just bad luck on my account LOL... My card has been declined when I have plenty of money in my checking account, my card was approved for only $7 another time, \"the register says your card is expired\" when none of those things were legitimate issues?
The first time I was completely freaked out, thinking someone drained everything out of my bank account some how, since I gave the Wingstop girl my debit card... I drove right over to Bank of America and checked my balance... Nope! The money is still in my account... So I got cash, drove back over and paid... Then left, extremely stressed out... The second time I experienced issues with their register I actually had cash on me so it wasn't a big deal... However this time I went in unprepared (totally my fault I guess? Never mind that they should have reliable registers that accept all VISA cards in the year 2016...) since it has been probably 6 months or more that I have refused to spend money there... I have friends coming into town late who will be extremely hungry no doubt after an 8 hour drive from California and I worked late SO I decided to order out from this Wingstop when nothing else was really open at this hour... BIG MISTAKE! I get there and the little girl behind the counter proudly states to the whole restaurant that my card was declined... I tell her that is impossible, what did your register actually tell you. \"Oh well it says your card is expired\" so... 1. It's telling you my card is expired not declined and 2. It is clearly not expired as per the date ON my card? I dunno... Maybe a lot of people come in there and order food who don't really have money to pay for it and that gets irritating? But maybe... Just MAYBE you guys need to get a clue and realize it is your register since twice now, I had to drive myself over to a bank and retrieve cash?! Never coming to this location again. Honestly so ridiculous and annoying.

\"VISA, it's everywhere you want to be.\"
I guess I don't want to be at Wingstop ever again..."}
{"text":"Wing stop very clean and employees where very sweet and helpful since It was the first time me and my fianc√© walked in there. We went ahead and order and the food was just awful the French fries where covered in salt the wings where not even wings it looked like a chicken nugget with sauce on the bottom of the plate. It was horrible.!!!!"}
{"text":"This past Friday the 27th was the first time trying Wingstop, it was excellent! I had the boneless 15 piece split with different flavors both great, mango habanero & mild. The fries are great as well as the cole slaw. But even better was the customer service, CJ was the awesome young lady who took my order. I could see she was busy but still took the time to help me with my order. As I waited for my order I sat back & listened to her handle other customers, she went above and beyond with every person she help weather in person or on the phone. Whomever CJ's boss is needs to give her a huge raise, employees like her are hard to find......."}
{"text":"The wings were very dry. And they did not put much dry rub on the wings so they tasted like plain. Next time I want wings,  I'll just get hooter wings to go."}
{"text":"I just left the wing stop and my experience was horrible!  I'm from Georgia and the Wing stop in Georgia  is 100% better. It was seven of us and each one of our orders was wrong. Fries was very salty my wings was light skinned not dark.  They had to do my order over and it took them 45 mins."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was great had a good time. The inside was clean  I like that there is a ample space and not super packed but still enough people. The staff was friendly and had a good meal"}
{"text":"Well. I gave this place a shot ...
And I was warned but I didn't listen ... and ordered 'boneless wings' which are basically breaded chunks of chicken breast. They were to greasy and breading was soggy by the time we got back to the house. Fries were not that great either. 
This kind of food should probably be eaten right at the establishment otherwise it will turn into greasy soggy mess. 
So 3* for now but I might stop by again sometime and try their 'real' chicken wings to see if they live up to promise."}
{"text":"Just order wings to go, got them back to my office and started to eat when I pulled a hair out of my mouth---gross---! called the store spoke to Jorge/George the manager and he said and I quote \"There is NO way there was a hair in your food\"! \"I have really short hair and there is just no way that could happen\". I asked him if he was calling me a lair? He said \"No, you said that not me\". I asked for the general manager and he gave me the name Rachel and said she would be in at 5:00 pm. I will be calling back today and I will happily update this post as things progress."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place with reasonably priced wings and I've finally found it. They have a wide delivery range which came in handy since I usually can't get anything I want brought to my door! The food was excellent. I got Smokey BBQ and Mango Habanero bone in wings and was utterly ecstatic with the flavor and quality of the meat.

If I remain in their delivery area, I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Okay, so you know this place is pretty darn tight.  Locals and hood rats find their way here. Oh you know it, my crew was itching for some hot wings and I say, wing a ding stop. Rolling to the grub joint. I told my boy DJ what's ur name to chill wit  us.  Wing a ding we were sweaingt like 2 rats in a wool sock, know what I mean. Anyway it's all good here,  4 thumbs up cuz the other was to sticky to reply. Lates.."}
{"text":"I freagin' love this  place. The fries are super salty and great with  ranch.  The wings  are always  great. I dont think the atomic is  really spicey. I prefer the taste of the buffalo hot.  I get all flats, no legs. 
I dont like the wait time or the lack  of space but thats fjne."}
{"text":"Love this place!! There wings are delicious!! so many different flavors to choose from!! Even tried there fries they are yummy!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered from them and I have to say it's some of the best customer service I've ever received.  She helped me so much with my order and they got it out and ready to go in 5 min. I'm going here from now on instead of Buffalo Wild wings."}
{"text":"Love this place , you can not find better wings nowhere else . It's a lil busy but it means people want to eat there , no wonder. Thank you guys for your service!"}
{"text":"This place gets worse and worse every time. Throwing wings in a fryer isn't that hard. Why have I been sitting here for 45 minutes. I only ordered 16 wings  They already took my money"}
{"text":"I tried to Make it to go order at 11 PM but I have to pay over the phone and give my credit card information to someone I don't know. I've been to plenty of wing stops all across the country and I always make a to go order and pay when I get to the store and that is the professional way of doing business. But given my credit card to strangers over the phone who could quit their job tomorrow and have my information is completely unheard of and unprofessional and very dangerous. On the other hand the sink in the men's bathroom doesn't even stay on for two seconds for me to be able to wash my hands and that is a health if you specially when you eat chicken and someone should report it to the food department or health department. This location is below negative and I will send an email wings stop head quarters. This location is terrible and makes wing stop look bad.i love wing stop but this place drops it status"}
{"text":"I love Wing Stop wings but I will NEVER go to this location again. I was so happy when this store arrived in our neighborhood, it is so much closer to us than 59th Ave and T-Bird where we have always had great food and perfect service. However our first time to this store, they messed up our to-go order 3 times! We were ordering bone in wings and every time got boneless..  Each time we did not know it was wrong until we got the food home... so back and forth! Our original order was placed at 6pm, and we finally ate dinner at 9:00!
The second time it was wrong they refunded our price and sent us home with what would turn out to be another wrong order. I called and said enough is enough and asked them to please deliver the correct order, they said they could not deliver but offered we come back in that night for the correct order and they would \"Put another 24 piece family meal in the book for next time\"
We tried them again last night, I ordered on-line so the cashier could not mess it up again and when I went to pick it up they did not have me in their \"book\" and \"Angela\" treated me like a conniving thief. After some arguing \"Angela\" told me this would be the last time they would do it, as if I was trying to get something for nothing! 
 \"Hey Wing Stop, I can pay for my food but I can't afford your aggravation!\"
PS-  
Last night our wings did have the bones in but were ALL drumlettes... WTF?
PS- 
loose Angela"}
{"text":"There wings are to die for. Louisiana rub is the flavor to get. They are always moist in the inside and full of meat"}
{"text":"Awful. Everything is awful from the staff to the food. Flew back in to town landed and went there because it was the only thing open. The lady who took our order was incredibly rude. They asked us when we ordered if we wanted ranch - we said yes. When we got our order (after people who ordered more than us and were behind us in line) they told us they didn't have ranch. The manager listened to this lady speak rudely to us when we asked why we did not get our order. This is the third time I have had an awful experience there. The first time they gave us our food and half of the order was wrong. I would NOT recommend this wing stop to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been to a few of the various Wing Stop locations around Vegas and Henderson, and this is definitely my favorite one so far.  

--This one isn't located right next to a donut shop, so there's no temptation for dessert afterwards!
--The tables and restaurant are always pretty clean.
--The usual guy, Steve, is a total hoot.  He's a great dynamic guy and encourages his team to be friendly, fun, personable folks instead of fast food zombies.
--THE WINGS!  They are so are SO good.  They make your wings fresh to  order, so you have to wait but it's completely worth it!
--They have the best fast food french fries in the world.  No seriously.  No really.  YES!
--Most of their business is take-out, so the small place can always easily accommodate it's dine in customers.
--Customers have the option to order their wings online or over the phone for pick up.

A few tips:
Unless you like soggy chicken, I wouldn't recommend the boneless wings or boneless strips.  They are great chunks of chicken breast, but the sauces really sogg up the breading and just sort of cause them to bleh out.
Atomic should come with a surgeon general's warning.  I love hot spicy foods, but these are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Here for the first time. Seriously disappointed on the prep time; did not expect to wait 20 minutes to get my food at 10:53PM. I'll leave it at this...your night shift men are seriously slacking. The women were running the front AND back of the house. I haven't even eaten yet and I'm not too impressed. I know they say not to judge a book by its covers, but even if the food is outstanding, I've already been turned off by the work ethic and customer service."}
{"text":"If you need real wings then stop having red bull and halt at Wingstop. Try the atomic if you are into SPICYness . All the flavors are ok except the mango which is way too sweet."}
{"text":"my fries were horrible they were stale no seasoning whatsoever. They didn't care about my food  Really disappointed tonight...
Wing stop is my Spot but you guys let me down tonight"}
{"text":"I'm a usual customer here. But I will no longer be coming after today's horrible service. I made an order online and came into the store to pick up and there was a huge line (customers that eat in). I went to the guys up at the cashier and told him if I had to make line for my pick up and he said 'yes'. I could see my wing order ready to go right behind him, all he had to do was grab it and charge my card. The whole reason why I made an online order was for fast service. The obviously do not understand that."}
{"text":"The food is decent, ita wingstop so it pretty uniform no matter which location you go to. We walked on and order and it took 45 minutes to get our fiod and there were only three cusotmers in the entire place. Also the clerk was very rude and even after telling her we didnt want cheese with our fries she still asded it on the order. Also rhere is no changing table in  the bathrooms.  Its 110 outside so changing a baby in a car not exactly easy and im not changing him on the floor."}
{"text":"To me definitely the best and at this location always a pleasant and welcome atmosphere. Like the variety of the wing sauces Atomic and Mango Habanero great if u love spicy wings.. Plus 2 dlls. Beers domestic and premiun great... Will most definitely keep coming back .."}
{"text":"Im giving this a one star because the chicken needs to be fried crispy. The skin was rubbery and the seasoning was light. The location was clean but had a weird smell."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday to try out as I have a store near here. Store is new and clean with plenty of help in kitchen. Customer ahead of me made order and girl on cash draw had to go in kitchen for help. Then when my turn she did not know what was even on their menu board, had to go in kitchen again to get clarified. Made my order for some wings , paid for them then she told me it would be 18 minutes. Told her I was not waiting 18 minutes for wings. This brought another trip to kitchen.came back and told me they could do in 8 minutes. Decided wanted my money back instead, which caused another trip to kitchen. Manager came back and refunded me. Went next door  and got my usual wings in 5 minutes. 
  Do not mind waiting some but have problem with putting people on cash draw that are not trained."}
{"text":"It took 25 minutes to put together basic wings and fries when there were only 3 people waiting. The service at this place is terrible. The food was cold. DO NOT GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Garlic parm is moist and cheesy garlicky! I love it! The bbq sauce is pretty ordinary, didnt meet my expectations. The wings are medium sized and I would say 8pcs is enough for me while the hubs is 12pcs. The seasoned fries are so damn good , large is enough to share with two people."}
{"text":"Wings are excellent we always get the  Louisiana & Atomic wings in the 50 wing Family Meal.   The rolls are like homemade you can't get enough of them.  I recommend this wing stop highly."}
{"text":"my experience here was okay. the girls that worked here gave okay service. they weren't sassy or anything.
I'd give this location a 5-stars, but I'm bringing it down to 4-stars instead because of the quality of their food.
so I ordered 8 piece wings and fries. I fricken love how the Wing Stop by unlv fries are!!!! How flavorful and seasoned theirs is! But THIS location?! Hell no! By the time I got my food, the first thing I ate were the fries. And it tasted like its been sitting on the kitchen counter for a good 20 minutes. it wasn't fresh anymore. but my hungry ass wanted to just eat.
maybe I'll come back here,
I just hope their food is more fresh!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of wings. I don't think wing stops wings were a disappointment. Although the wings were good customer service is not. I had to wait in like for about 10 mins just to get a refill of water. Came in one night at about 7 and they were out of fries which seemed odd and a big let down. I recommend the boneless bbq."}
{"text":"Even though the winds I get are super spicy, the ladies are always nice with giving me extra water or asking if I need anything. They are nice and charismatic, I always visit this place when I am around the area."}
{"text":"We normally love Wingstop! We have always eaten here in every major city we have lived in that had one. 
I've been pleased with them until today!

It's Friday evening and we ordered our food which went smoothly and went to look for a table. 
We walk around and there is a worker on her phone eating her meal at the big round table up front all by herself!
Our family has multiple small children and could benefit from sitting at this table. 
She then left all her food and belongings at the table to go make a phone call and smoke out front. 
We fit our family at a tiny table until the worker went back to work. 

I then had to go get our cups because they never gave them to me. 
I asked for cups for water for our kids!
The worker proceeded to tell me that it would cost me money for the cup. 
When we got our food they didn't put the extra seasoning that I had asked for. And they said that would cost more money. 
My husband had to go up and argue with them that I told them I wanted extra seasoning. They finally gave us some. 
Are you kidding me......... 

At this point if I would have known this would all happen before ordering I would not have had my family eat here. 
And if we were close to home I would just get it as take-out and not even sit here. 

My family will never come back here agin!"}
{"text":"This location has got to be #1 not only In food quality, but customer service. I am always greeted with a smile as soon as I walk through the doors. The food is always hot and ready to go when I go pick it up and the flavors are always so savory. I've been going to this Wingstop location for almost about three years now and let me tell you they never disappoint. Every employee, from the cashiers to the manager, have always been so polite and welcoming to me . AND DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE VOODO FRIES. THEY ARE TO DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"This place blows! They are slow and the always get my order wrong, seriously how hard is it to get an order right? 
It's been 3 times in a row now."}
{"text":"Super slow. 7 customers and all waiting in line for about 20 to 30 min. Do t know if it was the manager but the 2 lady's In the back talking the phone"}
{"text":"Over priced for what they offer. Not only did their wings taste like a stick of butter but their associates failed to mention that thier cheesy fries arnt made with melted cheese they give you a side of nacho cheese.  When my fiance called to ask about the fries cause the side looked more like mustard the girl who answered the phone called him a ma'am... he has a deep voice so this just goes to show that she was paying him no mind. Highly disopointed with the food and servuce and we do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"Very efficient! I ordered online, went right in and got my food. The chicken wings were cooked perfectly! I will definitely make this my regular take-out wing spot."}
{"text":"I ordered wing stop for the first time tonight. and let me tell ya... At first I though to myself \"Wow! 10 boneless wings, fries and a 20oz drink for $12? what a good deal!\"- but as soon as I saw the slightly burnt grease soaked flimsy fries glistening in the light, I understood why it was so cheap. I got the 10 piece boneless garlic parmesan wings only to open the box and see what looked like a bunch of grease laden plain wings that had green container Walmart brand parmesan cheese excessively dumped on them. And honestly, it tasted exactly like that. The only part of the meal that I actually enjoyed was the only thing they don't make, the Coca Cola I ordered- which I had to chug to be able to stomach the rest of my very below par meal."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I am a huge Wing stop fan but this is by far THE WORST location I have ever been to. It needs new management and an entire new staff. For starters, the two trash receptacles outside were overflowing, multiple tables were covered in trash, the drink station was filthy complete with overflowing ice spilling on the floor, and the men behind the register were drinking beers as they took my order. I promise I'm not making this up! The food was very bad compared to all other Wing Stops I have been to in various states. Avoid this location at all costs!!"}
{"text":"Wings are pretty good, but service is poor. Was told it would be only 15min wait and ended up waiting over 45min. They tried to compensate by giving me 5 free wings but it was too much food. I would have paid more for less wings and better service. Staff does not seem like they enjoy being there. Will probably not come back to this location."}
{"text":"Ordered my food an hour ago via phone, they said my order would me ready in 15 minutes. 
I get here I waited 10 extra minutes & my food wasn't ready. I was told to wait an extra 10 minutes. 
How in the world can u explain this? My food was ordered an hr ago?! 
Every time I come to wing stop something is wrong.  Last time I come here."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but thia location irritated me that much ...If I could I would give this place a zero star rating.
  First I places a order online ....when I went to call the wingstop the manager on duty didn't have my order while I expressed to her that I received  my 3 mail conformation that my order was received. I said fine maybe the computer had a error ...so I placed the same order over the phone with the manager..later on that day I went to pay for my order I placed and the girl working there couldn't find the order the manager wrote down..so pretty much at the point I had it ....this establishment is beyond unorganized...save ur money go somewhere else.."}
{"text":"So far so good! Wing stop never fails. Glad they opened one right here near me. This will definitely be my go to spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Probably the worst wings I've ever eaten or at least attempted to eat. BBQ was just edible, Cajun and hot went in the trash. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I love WINGSTOP and iv been to different locations but i have to say RUDNESS up in here..you have people working here that are hella rude..customer service sucks..but i still love my wings..maybe look into hiring people that will greet customers and make them feel good and make them want to come back instead of making them want to NEVER come here again..i rather drive far out then come here again..gave 1  because there was no option of giving none."}
{"text":"My friends and I went in Wingstop at two minutes to midnight thinking these people are going to hate us...they close at midnight. We were surprised. We offered to take order to go, and they were so nice. They told us to take as long as we like..so we kind of did. We ordered the lemon pepper, which was off the charts amazing. We also ordered the hot, which was good. The BBQ was amazing. These are the best wings in town. The ranch was homemade, and the fries had what tasted like sugar on them. They also have pitchers of beer, which is probably last thing we needed...but we had a driver. The staff was so friendly. They offered to package the wings we had left to go. To our surprise when we got home they had given us extra dinner rolls, ranch, beans, and potato salad. This place is awesome. Been to other Wingstops, which are wonderful...but the staff killed it tonight...and the food rocked.."}
{"text":"This was my boyfriends and I first time here. We ordered 3 different wings. We had the habanero mango, lemon pepper & atomic. Honestly, they were all very nasty not good at all & the wings felt dry. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutley LOVE their wings!! I have never had a problem with them as I did at BWW plus a military discount!! Love all the flavors!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place a fucking 000 sitting here for 45 minutes they hadn't even put the order other people came in and ordered after me and got their food then the fucking management is sorry as hell gonna ask after they took my money did I want it back then they gave me 40 wings instead of 20 what a waste of a fucking night all I wanted was some chicken damn."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with my last stop here. There was a guy and girl working on the front counter and they were more concentrated whispering and having a conversation then taking my order. The guy that was speaking the counter was also glued to his phone, looked like he was busy texting or playing with Facebook. I do have to say though that my order was correct and the food was good but this place definitely lacked in detail."}
{"text":"This location is awesome really friendly customer service, was greeted right when we walked in the door and they bring the food to your table. Food was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I'm so glad they opened this location, we used to go to the 7017 Spring Mountain Rd location for over 10 years but the service went down hill ,they use to take the food to your table but I guess they stopped doing that and traded it for a bar stool where they sit in behind the register, they don't even stand up to take your order. As for the food it sucks, the wings feel rubbery and always lack enough sauce. Plus there's some perverted fat bald short guy working there, he straight up stares woman up and down. I know because he did that to my wife I laughed at him and said what's this fool staring at and the guy acted like he didn't hear me. He also loves engaging in long awkward conversations with single woman, trust me I've seen him do it on several occasions. Feel bad for them you can see how uncomfortable they are by there face. Will never go back to that location ever again."}
{"text":"Love the wings and love the service. Easy phone ordering and ready when I get there. I'd give 5 stars...too good to pass up."}
{"text":"I drive a tow truck so I'm all over but the the wing stop on nellis seems to have fresh wings always I will go back"}
{"text":"Placed a order for a 40 piece family pack in store. Waited around 20 minutes which wasn't bad for a Friday night. Manager was consistent on updated us on our order instead of just letting us sit there. Great and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We ordered carry out this evening and were really looking forward to some succulent wings. We ordered the 24 piece family meal, bone-in classic wings part plain, part lemon pepper and part garlic parmesan.  What a disappointment. The wings were overcooked, tough and dry not to mention flavorless. Doubt we will give this place another try."}
{"text":"Ordered online around 9 :00pm for an order to be picked up later that night at 10:15pm.  Showed up to pay and received an \"oh there you are!\" from the lady at the cash register.

Arrived at 10:15pm as planned, so I wasn't sure where that comment came from? Go to eat a wing in the car and it was not even close to warm, seems to me the order was made at the time it was placed resulting in my room temperature \"hot wings\".

Lucky for me I was able to heat up my \"cold wings\" and enjoy the mediocrity of  microwave penetrated chicken wings. 1 star for following directions. 1 star for flavor. 1 star for me having a reheating device."}
{"text":"Do not order online if you do not wish to be charged twice. I used to go to wingstop when I lived in Peoria and always enjoyed the wings. The wings in Champaign were good and I was not really disappointed in the quality of the wings. The employees there are the reason why I will not go back. I ordered online, and when I went to pickup the wings I was asked for my charge card again. They say they do this when you order online. I attempted to use a coupon and they just took it, did not give me my free fries. Fed up I just left the store. I ordered 24 wings and a large fry. 12 of one flavor and two orders of 6. I received the 12 of one flavor then 7 of another and 5 of the last. Then the next day I realized that I was charged twice on my credit card. If you walk in and order maybe your experience will be better."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars the Manger melissa must be playing around with everyone else in there I sure heard a lot of talking and jokes but it wasn't funny when after waiting for my order for 25 plus mins someone was sent to the counter to let me know my wings where never dropped they skipped them and forgot. Total joke guess no lunch before I'm late for work today  11/30/2016 4:55pm"}
{"text":"I love you wingstop....for cooking up the fastest batch ever before I risk missing my flight. You never disappoint me with the garlic parmesan, which I will forever be loyal to. Thank you."}
{"text":"bad customer service - you feel like a burden as soon as you walk in."}
{"text":"Rude manager, wouldn't accept my CMU id for the student discount. Mediocre food. Go to wingharts instead."}
{"text":"I love the wings here, however the fact that three  carryout orders came in after us and left before we even received our food was quite disappointing. The man with a forearm tattoo made an inappropriate comment to my husband when calling our order after waiting 30 mins+."}
{"text":"I have been to two Wingstop locations in north Las Vegas, this one is by far the best. The team is fast, friendly and the food is fresh. What more can you ask for? Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Worst management ever. They charged me twice for a single meal and they took for ever to serve."}
{"text":"Poor Customer Service! I visit this location fairly often but tonight was the worst! Marvin, the manager took my order, and got it wrong. When I explained to him it wasn't what I ordered nor was it what he repeated back he basically shrugged his shoulders and said oh well. He did nothing to rectify the issue, not even a simple apology which I would have gladly accepted as mistakes happen. I asked for the corporate number and he said its on the website. I jumped right on the website to a \"contact us\" form. Site stated the business hours are from 8a-5p and it may take 96 hours to respond as the personally respond to all messages. Approximately 10 minutes after I hit submit, I get this generic email stating we're sorry you're not pleased! I'm not buying it at all. I enjoy wingstop but I will not be returning. Throughout my years in customer service I've learned customers will tolerate a lot but poor service isn't one of them!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and received a confirmation call which I totally appreciated. When I arrived earlier than I indicated on my online order, I was greeted by pleasant and friendly faces which is always a plus in my book. Nowadays you walk into some places and you don't even get acknowledged! The wings were fresh and perfectly sauced. I'll definitely be returning to this location when I get a craving for wings!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you go to stuff your face. It's conveniently located near the east suburbs. It's a go-to that never dissapoints. Service is getting better. They have expanded into the neighbor's location so it now has way more dining space. As other reviewers have commented, the only downside can be the wait sometimes. So order ahead or come prepared for it. Otherwise, this is the best location in town."}
{"text":"It simply does not get better than this!  Put a Wing Stop next door to Buffalo Wild Wings....  They would then need to re-name the Tempe Bowl Game, cuz Buffalo's would cease to exist around here....  Why are you in this small plaza, small store and, unseen?  YOU NEED TO BE ON MILL AVE, or next to Jimmy John's on Apache.... Or on ASU games and on campus.

The large fries are too much for two ppl, bring a 3rd... Think bigger and better than 5 Guys, and 1/3 the grease.  Chicken is perfect, never over-fried and great seasoning.  They've got a friend for life now."}
{"text":"Nice friendly atmosphere. Tony the assistant manager is a good guy give him a raise! But he just quit.. Btw the wings were cold when they gave them out and so were the frys. He came up to our table me apologized to us about the fact that are wings are ready but none of the other team members gave us are food. I kinda feel bad for tony I understand what it's like to work with bad co-workers. But he seemed to be the only worker that cared at wingstop. If that was me I'd try to get that guy back."}
{"text":"Really good! Great atmosphere and friendly service. We went to this Wingstop because we were attending a high school football game right around the corner. We will definitely be back.

 The wings were really yummy, they provide you with plenty of ranch and the veggies were nice and fresh. They also have a new Coca-Cola machine that was fun to use and try different drink combos. 

The ladies taking orders at the counter were super, super friendly despite how crazy busy they were. 

Thanks for a fun, pre-football meal!"}
{"text":"Probably the lousiest chicken & service I have had in a while.  The hot sauce is straight from the bottle with all heat & no flavor."}
{"text":"They have the BEST WINGS  in Vegas. Our favorite is hot lemon pepper. With French fries and moZerrella sticks are delicious.it has an upbeat atmosphere. I love this place"}
{"text":"These bitches that work in this location are the most incompetent bunch of ingrates on this planet. The manager that fat bitch is not worth two pennies rubbed together. Every time I place an order it's a problem this location should be shut the fuck down."}
{"text":"So the last time I had came to this location I experienced such AWFUL customer service (but their food is great). This time my order had been taken by this very nice girl Zemon, I think her name was, and let me tell you she was AMAZING she hooked us up and gave us a great deal & I don't mean discounts or anything but she got our complicated order and was really friendly, she gave off such a welcoming vibe. Her customer service is great!!"}
{"text":"No buffalo hot?  No cajun?  Kids order chicken tenders and they have to check to see if they have enough tenders for the order?  Nice people and usually good but if you can't carry the basics...the viability of the business isn't good!"}
{"text":"Love this place being coming here for like 2 and half years and the service is great especially the cashiers i believe its gaby  and marbea  they r just so wonderful and respectful and polite i really recommend  this place.........."}
{"text":"Stephanie was very rude I asked her how much was the wings and she ignored me and gave me an attitude I asked once again politely and she said WHAT ? I don't understand why she was rude all I wanted to know how much for bone in wings I then ordered and they game me my 6 piece combo 20 minutes later my food was cold. They were very loud also they play too much in there I even heard them talking about cheating on their boyfriends it is no one business, very distracted to the customers never coming in again I don't recommend this wing stop to anyone."}
{"text":"Service almost non existent, bathrooms dirty and no toilet paper and no paper to wipe your hands at the service bar,, someone IS NOT being a good manager and the owners along with customers are being let down"}
{"text":"Great food and service always get our orders right 
and quick I always phone ahead so no waiting"}
{"text":"Don't waist your time. Place isn't very clean. Two different tables were sticky. Seemed to be a lot of people hanging out and chatting with the employees. Food took way to long, I almost left without even waiting for my food. I was just going to chalk the loss up to a learning experience. Update: ended up getting my money back and was told that my ticket was handed back to me instead of the kitchen. They were very apologetic, with the uncleanliness of the place, the sketchy people that appeared to be hanging out talking to o the employees, I haven't ever been back."}
{"text":"Pretty good if you don't order \"to go \" we notice we get fatty pieces if we order food to go from this restaurant... So definitely try it out when you have time to sit and eat inside!"}
{"text":"I just love this place but just to give you a tip if you call your order in double check it before you leave to make sure everything is correct , I cannot begin to tell you how many times they got the order wrong mostly minor things but still you need to check it. One time they forgot to put the fries in,   I even asked if they were in the bag before I left and they said yes I failed to check , next time I will do so myself."}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone. Got 20 wings and a free fry. I had checked the price online but when I picked up the food there was a few dollars price difference. I figured the receipt would have everything, while it does have what you ordered the way the receipt prints makes it impossible to determine exactly what you ordered. Who ever cashed me out wasn't helpful or friendly. The garlic parmesan wings were wwwaaayyyy over seasoned and I didn't think the teriyaki wings had that much flavor. Fries were soggy."}
{"text":"First time going to wing stop. Terrible service. I don't understand why it takes 20 mins make wings. My boyfriend has only an hour lunch break."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment after I've heard this place is good- wings tasted ok but were really little. The fries have something like a sugar salt on it and it gets really gross after just a few bites. Mine were also drenched in this mystery coating so you didn't even know you were eating fries. The roll also had a very sweet taste to it. I lost my appetite after the second bite of each item. Veggies were the only good part of this meal and those are hard to mess up. I won't be going back, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing the main flavors I would recommend is the lemon pepper or the mango habinero. I have no problem going to the restaurant and ordering there, it's just sometimes I don't want to drive very far. I wish they delivered."}
{"text":"People were nice and efficient  I was told 50 wings would be ready in 25 minutes and they were right on. The wings were tasty and juicy. Got ranch and it was so good, haven't had ranch dressing that good in a long time."}
{"text":"Just gave this place a second try and I am even more disappointed than I had been the first time. Same horrendous service, soggy fries, and mediocre wings. What really put the cherry on the cake was the \"thug\" cashier who was told 3 times that I wanted my order to go and he brought it to me as if I were eating-in. When I corrected him he began to roll his eyes and start huffing and puffing. No seriously, he looks like he is thirty. The food was just as bad. Soggy fries and tiny burnt wings that tastes like rubber, yeah no thanks. I am not sure what people like about this place but I guess it's good enough to impress a bunch of frat guys at the ASU campus nearby. If you appreciate quality service and good food don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding.  Everyone on staff gets you when you come in.   Wing stop wings are consistent and alway great at all location.  But the service here over the top.
They need a tip jar up front!"}
{"text":"The time was 11:45 and me and my cousin were going to place a order, but they said they were closed. so me and my cousin left disappointed because they closed 15 minutes early but on top of that when we were looking for a other place to eat using  my phone in my cousin's car. A other customer comes in and places a order.  This is what I call bad customer service. my question is why would you serve him and not us. to me that might have been racial profiling and that is not okay in my book."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! My boyfriend and I literally eat here at least once a week. It is amazing! We have tried wings at many different places and this place is by far our most favorite. If you go you have to order the french fries and the garlic parmesan wings. We always order our food to go and they say that it will be ready in 14 minutes (random number) and it's always ready by the time we get there. The people who work there are also very friendly and really helpful. We have never had any problems with our food or service and we will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Hope the wings are good... I've been sitting here waiting for 20 min now.  Employees are kind and professional.  They better be friggin amazing for this long of a wait."}
{"text":"Location: I have become more of a fan for this particular Wing Stop since they expanded essentially doubling their dining room size.  It became a lot more roomy with well, more TVs, Tables/chairs and a second soda machine (which is place facing the expanded space so it doesn't get overcrowded). The space makes the place more inviting to sit down, enjoy your meal, chat and leave at your own pace. For the most part, it is kept very clean, maybe a tray here and there left on the table but the staff is good on cleaning up soon after someone leaves. 

Staff: The cashiers that have taken my orders or gave my to go orders in the past have all been smiles, friendly and easy to talk to when talking about the food. Even when there's a crowd they have maintained a positive vibe and don't rush you. Don't believe I have ever had a complaint with the staff. 

The food/drinks: wings were nice and hot and sauces are great. I have stuck mainly with traditional wings with veggies and ranch dressing but it has never disappointed me yet. I think the prices are fair for the quality of the wings. The soda machines are the coca-cola freestyle machines that you can choose a lot of soda options with flavorings. Those machines are awesome. 

Overall, great place to get wings if you want a clean environment and good quality wings without the dim lit and craziness you might find at a Buffalo Wild Wings or some other dive. Family friendly, great service. You can never go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Seeing the other reviews I should have consulted yelp before attempting to have an nice quick lunch with my husband in this establishment. We waited for 30 minutes for an order of wings while the staff horse around in the back. I spent my whole lunch break waiting for my order and every time I will ask if they were done they will lie and tell me they were boxing it. When I received my order the fries were burnt salty and loaded with garlic/onion powder. This establishment clearly does not care how they serve their food. The wings were some what good but not to our standards. If you have time I recommend The Tavern in front of Concord Mills Mall."}
{"text":"I went to this location of Wingstop 2 other times since this one just recently opened but never late in the evening on a weekend.  Big mistake first of all I phone in my order and the girl that answered told i the phone could not seem to get a combo with 4 wings with one sauce and the other 4 with another sauce correct. I should have stopped there. But finally she said it would be 25 minutes. I arrived in 25 minutes and was told it was not ready. I waited and waited. In the mean time the had really messed up this other guys order. Gave it to someone else and they brought it back and wanted to give it to him. That was just ridiculous. After another 20 minutes I received my order. I took it home and it was horrible the wings were like they had been fried hard and sitting out then sauce put on them. The fries has made the top of the bag really greasy. The need some older people in there with customer service skills that tale pride in what they are doing. If they don't get it together the location will close. People in the neighborhood will stop coming and word about the bad food and bad service will be their demise."}
{"text":"It is said to write this review.  The product can be great but the new owners turn it out in an awful manner.  Wings were over cooked.  40 wings all two boned sectioned.  When asked why owner responded that their purveyor made a mistake.  The only mistake was to lie to the customer.    I will not be back."}
{"text":"Asked my wife to pick food up from here today and it was the worst mistake. Everything from my Buffalo wings to my wife chicken strip were dry. My kid chicken strip was dry, that he had to peel the outside off just to try and find any decent part in the middle. All our $$ for today on food went to waste we threw it all away and are very mad. Don't eat from this wingstop!"}
{"text":"If i could rate this place 0 stars i would. WORST place ever !!! take your money somewhere else ! Around 3 weeks ago we stoped at this location for some food. Everything seemed fine until we found a piece of a KNIFE in one of the wings!! A KNIFE!!! That is an immediate hazard. We talked to the manager and all she said was \"sorry, you will get 30% off on your next visit\" She didn't not offer a new batch or a refund. This is unacceptable.  I could have gotten hurt. After this incident i will NEVER be returning back to any of your locations. That is disgusting and not safe. Costumer service also did a HORRIBLE job when i tried to contact them."}
{"text":"Love this place , eat here when I'm trying to low carb it, sometimes twice a week. Usually we order 50 wings , celery sticks 3 blue cheese dressings 2 reg drinks around $40 , which I think is a great deal. We like the Cajun , teriyaki, lemon pepper and garlic Parmesan. Minimum wait is 15 min if there not busy little longer if busy because they cook to order. Wing come out nice and hot. Pretty consistant . Only complaint they need   more sauce selections a Thai peanut sauce would b good."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I am so impressed with the the amazing employees.  Both times they have been very upbeat and extremely helpful!  The food has been great and the atmosphere much better suited to conversation with the people at your table, something I really appreciate!  This is my new first choice for wings!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now in the past several weeks. The first time as a walk in and was greeted, order taken and hot perfectly cooked wings in about 20 mins. The 2nd time I called in a pickup order, the employee on the phone was courteous, confirmed my order and said it would be ready in 18 mins. It was being bagged as I walked in. Again- hot, perfectly cooked and flavorful wings. The only complaint is there needs to be a location further north west. I hope I continue to have a positive experience because the wings are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Not so sure why it takes 20-25 minutes to fry chicken. Every place I've cooked at had them done in under 10. I've ordered 3 times and always over 20 minutes. Employees just wandering around with no urgency. You're new but come on. If I want to wait that long for wings I'd like to enjoy a beer with it."}
{"text":"Good location, close to home. Consistent flavor in all locations throughout the states. Tasty lemon pepper and cajun wings and fries. MmmMmmMmm"}
{"text":"Okay one word: AMAZING! The wings are so delicious and flavorful. My favorite are the BBQ wings. The first time we ate here, they had gifted us a side of heir French fries. Yes the fries are amazing as well( way better than McDonalds)! The staff was wonderful and very kind. We don't eat here often, but that's because of my busy schedule. 
      If you're ever craving wings, this is the place!"}
{"text":"The service here is great. I placed a huge order my first time and everything came out in a timely manner. The workers even offered to help me carry the food back into my car. Everyone was smiling and so helpful."}
{"text":"Walked into the building to find a solo cashier on the phone. Friends and I think he is taking an order and we set to deciding our orders. At least 5 minutes pass by and this cashier has yet to acknowledge us and no one else has come to the front to see if we have been helped. We notice the cashier smiling and laughing while talking on the phone. We realize he is not taking an order, but appears to be engaged in a personal conversation. Simply put, we left without a single employee greeting us."}
{"text":"By far the best wing spot in the city. The fries are always fresh and the wings are always well cooked. I go to Buffalo Wild Wings and sometimes the wings are still raw in the inside. I can really apprciate these wings especially the lemon pepper ones. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a honest review... a couple weeks ago - I palced an order for my mother, my sister and i. 3 of the 8piece meals with frys and drinks. Two orders came incorrect 1 had no sauce and the other had wrong sauce - & no EXTRA crispy as requested  for all 3 and cold fries literally. Even tho we showed up to pick it up when they told us. Wing stop promised us 2free replacements orders and we accepted. Today we came to get the orders and the night time manager was rude as hell to my mom telling her that it was untrue because they dont give free food.. he said he will call the female manager who told us this and he didnt really call he stood in a corner and came back and lied and said all he can do is give us 10% off. He was so rude to my mother... i had to leave in order to not get upset. This place has low stars for a reason... service and food arent up to standards"}
{"text":"I wish I read the reviews before ordering my food. It took 50 minutes, 50 MINUTES!!!! To get our food. I ordered 8 boneless wings, my boyfriend ordered 10 regular wings. When we got our food I received regular wings. So now I've waited damn near an hour for my food and it's not even right. Nothing more frustrating than that. I'm a huge French fry lover, and those were the worst French fries I have ever had. They were covered in sugar....disgusting. The service was terrible, they kept telling us \"5 minutes\" over and over again. I wouldn't even give this place a star. Save your money, your time and your appetite this place is a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Never have had a problem with Wingstop before until going to this location. First I was annoyed when the boy taking the orders told us mango habanero was not available for whatever reason. Then he only gave us one drink with our 10 strip combo & we usually get two drinks. Then I sat down to wait for my food and one of the bus girls proceeded to tell me I couldn't sit at the table I was sitting at because it was \"closed\". Closed? Really? But the table next to mine isn't closed? Hm, okay. Then throughout the rest of our meal the girl was moving around tables and mopping. I get that you are closing in an hour or so but moping next to people eating is never okay. I will not be going to this location again."}
{"text":"Don't really go to Wing Stop often, but I definitely have to after sparking a new love for chicken tenders! Got a 15 piece of chicken tenders (garlic Parmesan, Cajun, and lemon pepper). We also got two orders of fries, Cole slaw, and Gold Peak tea. The food was awesome, the chicken was, well, tender haha, and everything was well seasoned. Would have given 5 stars, but the service was okay. Great visit nonetheless. :)"}
{"text":"This may not be my favorite Wingstop location but it's still very good. The staff is nice, the food is fresh and I haven't had any troubles with my orders.  The lemon pepper is very lemony but lacks other flavors like the pepper that follows it's name or even salt. So far that's been the only flavor I didn't care for. The fries are my favorite style where they leave bits of the skin on. Wingstop is far better than the Wings chain that seems to have fizzled out over the years. All in all this is a good place to get wings nothing special."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service. i work next door and they are always so friendly and accommodating. The Manager is really sweet and does a  great job. Its always clean and i'm greeted with prompt service."}
{"text":"Ordered wings to go. Got the Hawaiian flavor and the mango habanero.  Both were excellent. Had a good amount of meat on the wings and the sauces were great. Only reason for 4 starts is the customer service wasn't the best"}
{"text":"I hope the management reads my last post and takes action before someone gets hurt."}
{"text":"If you love wings this is the spot for you! Friendly customer service. The wings and fries do take a while to be done, but I'd rather have them fresh and hot rather than sitting there waiting for someone to order them. Love the Cajun flavor! A little too spicy yet so good"}
{"text":"Good wings. Boneless pieces are big. The garlic Parmesan is not so good. Prices are reasonable and online ordering is simple. Customer service was fantastic for first visit."}
{"text":"Wings cooked perfectly. Buffalo sauce is great and equally as good is the blue cheese dressing. Coleslaw was a 7 out of 10 and the fries an 8 out of 10. Fairly quick, orders out in 10 minutes. Only complaint and i think im just getting old, but i cant stand when a eatery blasts adult contemporary music while you eat. Back ground music is fine but when you have to raise your voice to talk its too much. It is probably good for table turnover though because i ate and ran the hell out. I cant get the coldplay out of head. Ahhhh"}
{"text":"The wings are amazing and the staff is great!!!! Nice caring and patient.  Could not ask for better food or better service!!!!!:) And the Louisiana rub is amazing!!!!!!!!:D"}
{"text":"First time here and never will go back again. It took 28 minutes for them to deliver our foods while the guests who arrived 10 minutes after than us served at the same time also. I was really agitated already waiting for our food plus the music selection SUCKS!!! I don't understand why they play 60's-70's. Then, I saw the cashier went to the kitchen and was fighting for the receipts and just pinpointing this and that and those. Technically, no wonder why our order took so long because they are unorganized. Now, speaking of garlic parmesan chicken, I was surprised that literally they just pour the cheese on top of the chicken? Arggg!! I could have done that back at my place. The last complain was the fries, it was huge but totally blah!! OMG!  It really ruined my day for some reason, it spiraled the whole entire day because of this experience. Plus, when I asked the cashier what took so long? she said it takes 20 minutes for a chicken wing to cook!! so 20 minutes plus 8 minutes of preparation? Great!!!"}
{"text":"When you first walk into Wingstop, you are not slammed with the smell of chicken grease like most fast food places. Instead , you are enveloped with the savory smell of spices with a hint of garlic. The prices are very reasonable, and if you don't order ahead, you can bide your time with all of the old airplane memorabilia ( they have everything there from a real wooden prop to an actual fighter wing ie., Wing-Stop) which is quite extensive. A very pleasant all around  experience... I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"GREAT food, their wings are all made fresh so there's a couple minutes wait but that's good because that's how you know you're getting the best and not just something microwaved or sitting out ready to serve. I've had several of their flavors and they're all delicious. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will explain their menu to you if it's your first visit. The food all comes at a pretty great price, and even their sides are fantastic. Could not be better!"}
{"text":"It's at the intersection of Rainbow Blvd and Spring Mountain. There is a Wal Mart, Sams Club, Edge Fitness, Krispy Kreme and Radio Shack in the shopping center. I've gotten my wings quickly at this location and exactly what I order. There isn't free Wi-Fi or a small trash can at the bar where you can dispose your napkins, lemon rinds, etc at this location that I am aware of, whereas other locations I have seen these options."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST customer service! Go anywhere but here. Waited 30 minutes plus!  Watched other people get their wings before us when we had arrived first. For the lady on the floor that night learn some respect! You were the most disrespectful person I've ever seen hold a job dealing with the public maybe you should try something new. If only I could give 0 stars"}
{"text":"Very nice people! i was driving down Maryland and I saw this place just opened. I ordered the Louisana Rub 6 piece. Very tasty! Also they have one of those cool coke machines that makes like a gazillion different flavors. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I love that you are able to just request for all flats instead of having a mixture. My favorite flavor is lemon pepper!"}
{"text":"Best wing place. Thrilled. Great prices great flavors.. no seriously go if you are a wing lover and live in Henderson. I have been six times"}
{"text":"I will start by saying food is good. The wings were flavourful and delicious, the fries were nice and hot, and my wife loves their ranch! 
Now my two stars mainly go for the service and location, we arrived at 10:00pm and it seemed like they were getting ready to close! Considering their sign states that their closing hours are 12:00am!? It was very uncomfortable to seat in a table right next to where one of the workers was sweeping, moping and cleaning. It was a Friday night and the place seemed pretty busy, yet none of the workers seemed to care!
Management and workers have to understand that if your bussiness is open until midnight, than your place needs to have a comfortable and welcoming enviroment! Otherwise youre going to lose bussiness and of course profit."}
{"text":"Just opened and the food was on point and the service was very good. I am glade a Wing Stop finally opened up on my side of town!  My only complaint is they only have one soda machine which creates a line of people especially since they have so many choices. Wings were cooked perfectly and the fries were delicious!"}
{"text":"Bad service and worse wings. The so called hot wings taste like nothing but vinegar, the mango habanero are a poor attempt to copy BWs, and the boneless are like a cheap frozen brand but not as good... Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"In a Yankee in use to gr8 food from up north 4 me Wingstop is one of the best wings anywhere I use to go their Iin Texas when I say one here I got excited I get them cooked a little longer Garlic park is myfav and the fries off the chain"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The lemon pepper wings are to die for although after 5 it feels like you're going to die from dehydration because they are fairly salty. The original hot are more like a mild. Can't wait to try the new Korean sauce they just came out with."}
{"text":"We're staying at a hotel in Chandler and really wanted wingstop and there is one nearer to us but we decided on this location because it had better reviews. 

Well, pros: food was ready on time, employees were nice. 

Cons: we ordered cheese fries and got fries with no cheese. I ordered the lemon pepper boneless wings and I did not know this was a dry rub rather than a sauce. Had I known I really would have ordered some ranch to go. (However the flavor of these are REALLY good, very lemony.) the menu just doesn't specify what is a sauce and what is a rub except on the Louisiana dry rub and since that's specified, I figured everything that didn't say dry rub would be a sauce. 

Would go here again but would check order before leaving."}
{"text":"Wings are excellent! The fries are sweet and salty awesome flavor (when it's hot). This is a regular spot for us on a Friday night when we do not want to buy pizza."}
{"text":"The fries are soggy and the wings come swimming in a pool of grease.  Not worth the money at all!"}
{"text":"Worst experience. Stopped by to say hello to an old friend of mine and I a gentleman came up and asked me what I needed and I told him I needed to talk to him (my friend). The man then asked if I had an order, but I had told him what I went there to do. He was very rude about it. I told him I had not ordered yet. So he asked me what I wanted. I then just asked for a combo as the man kept urging me for some reason? There was no customers behind me or anything so I was confused as to why he was pressuring me to order? Anyways, would not recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The boneless wings are fantastic.  The habanero flavor is the best but I also like the buffalo hot flavor.  I ask for the fries to have less seasoning, because they put a lot on.  The service is good, though I wish they had regular napkins and a drink machine to get your own refills.  But those things don't keep me from enjoying this place."}
{"text":"WARNING FOOD POISON very severe case of food poisoning at this location please stay clear of this place I got food poisoning back in June went to the ER 4 times was put on 4 different meds 2 were the strongest antibiotics they have and was diagnosed with a condition called diversculitis from the bacteria and infection that was caused by contaminated chicken severed at this god forsaken place and got stock with $10,000 medical bills and the sorry excuse for a insurance company they deal with won't even return my calls or reply to any of my emails if any one else has had food poisoning at this location please bring it to my attention so this can be dealt with and we can try to keep this from happening again Thx and God Bless"}
{"text":"Guess I'm the stupid one to keep coming back here. Overpriced average food that always takes twice as long as they say to come out."}
{"text":"Pathetic. Hire new staff. This is the worst wing stop I've been to. 45 mins for our food. Everyone was moving so slow.. We were the only ones in here it should not have taken this long. Just been told they are waiting on my fried REALLY. Smh 45 min for fries......Never returning to this one again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, but I wasn't too fond of the flavors. The chipotle barbecue didn't have much flavor to it and the medium sauce tasted sweet rather than spicy. Regardless, they have many flavors and I look forward to trying more."}
{"text":"Horrible Wingstop location. I went here one time on Veterans Day with my friends and the lady at the register looked disappointed when we came in because we made her busy. She said \"No one usually comes in at this time, don't you kids have school or something?\" She made it seem like she didn't want us there, but yet there was no one there when the 4 of us came in. It also takes forever for the food to come out because they have 1 slow worker in the back. Skip this location."}
{"text":"I have never done this & I've been wanting to do this for a long time but didn't have the heart to do so..... but this is ridiculous this place is the worst! I've been coming here for a long time & I hate it more & more but this is the only nearby wing stop & that is why I come here but I am so annoyed of this place And one thing I cannot stand and I am so tired of is the SERVICE!!!!! It is the worst costumer service ! These girls have the worst attitude ever. They are sooo rude it is so bad! 60% of the time my food comes out nasty & food always takes for ever as I am seating here typing waiting for my food an hour later watching these girls being rude. & NO manager to run this place they have no idea how bad costumer service is here!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online three days before the Super Bowl. I was told they would be ready at my requested time of 5:00 pm. I arrive 15 minutes early and was told my order was up next. After waiting 30 minutes I asked  how much longer before they would be ready and was told at least an hour. This is the worst run establishment I've ever dealt with and is also the last time I will ever enter a Wingstop. The employees
Attitude of \"Oh well want a refund\"  must reflect the managements position as well. I along with at least 8 other customers took the refunds, some saying they waited over 2 hours just to be told it will be another 45 to 60 minutes. What a joke this place is!"}
{"text":"Wingstop is my only stop for wings in the valley.  I like the lemon pepper wings, although they are a bit salty sometimes.  The sides aren't that great so I stick with only wing take out orders, done in about 15 minutes.  The fries are strangely dark brown and tend to taste like chicken.  The price is about $2 more than I would like to pay but I keep going back so price is not that big of a turn off.  

Give the lemon pepper wings a try, you will love em."}
{"text":"Dont eat here. I'm from Dallas where the Wingstops are MUCH better. This Wingstop, however is horrible. The wings were old, skin was rubbery like the oil was not hot enough or old the oil was old. The service was okay, but everyone seemed like they were a little off. I'm so mad about my wings being gross! I had to throw them out."}
{"text":"DEFINITELY, the BEST Wingstop in Las Vegas. It starts with DD the awesome manager. She is always so friendly and attentive. Even her staff is upbeat and polite. We really appreciate how well they treat us. Finally, the food is always on point. We have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"These guys are great you need to let them have a tip jar it's the holidays come on stop being Scrooges"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service here. Our host Torica was super helpful and informative of the new loaded fries that we don't have back in cali. She was really nice and positive attitude along with the rest of the staff. Definitely coming back here next time were in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is great. Wigs are always cooked correctly and covered in sauce. The fries are so good here also! I get bbq and mild every time!"}
{"text":"Having been here 5-10 times, the service and the food has always been fantastic. That is until tonight. My friend and I split the Manager's 15 piece special, and I was feeling great until I started eating my boneless teriyaki. I started feeling nauseous, and only finished half of my meal. Within half an hour of being home, I threw up my meal. I can't remember the last time (if ever) that has happened to me. My friend also has had 3 \"unpleasant\" trips to the bathroom.... I hope I am the only one who gets physically sick. Anyway, I am incredibly disappointed, I hope no one else has had this experience. But it will be a while till we try this restaurant again I'm afraid."}
{"text":"The wings have a dry rub on them but there was too much oil dripping from them and it popped at the bottom.  At least, it was for me, I don't think they tried to get rid of the oil before putting on the dry rub.  I had also ordered a honey mustard dip but they didn't tell me that they were out and just gave me another dip with no explanation.

I did ask for the fries first and they were very accommodating and got it for us very quickly."}
{"text":"Always made fresh, always ready for pick up on time, and always gotten my correct order in the bag. Heck, they even throw in an extra wing every once in a while. Veggies taste fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"I love wing stop!!!!!!!! The only reason for 3 stars is cause this specific location never fails to get my order wrong somehow. Whether it's 4 wings instead of 6 or fries instead of veggies or even forgetting to put ranch in my bag, they always get it wrong. But Wingstop is the only place I eat wings from."}
{"text":"The food is great most of the time. I would come a lot more frequently if the customer service wasn't so horrible. Between that and the wait time, it's not even worth it.  They have replaced most of the staff and they are nicer than the old staff but this location still has quite a bit of improving to do."}
{"text":"The large fries had barely any fries. We asked for extra seasoning and extra crispy and they were neither. They had barely any seasoning. The order took forever to get, even though we pre ordered it only ahead of time. They had over an hour to prepare and get it out on time. Used to be good but now they have such low quality food and service. Not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"They are getting 2 stars only because the flavor of the food is good, but they can't handle large orders very well even though you can order them on the website like it's a completely normal option they do. They shorted us on a ton of sauce even though I selected 4 orders of the 100 packs. I honestly think they were rushing from mismanaging time due to how much was short. They do not disclose that they use Uber Eats for delivery, so what we though would be an on time delivery for a work event was, instead, a 30 minutes late delivery since the driver had to take multiple orders. That is how long our staff's lunches are. It had a major, negative impact on the purpose of the whole event since it left everyone complaining rather than being happy. Do not order from them unless it's nothing more than a personal order or 2. They will ruin it."}
{"text":"I'll give the employees 5 stars. Shady manager tried to say my order didn't go through just so he could close up. But the staff still made my order cheerfully and accurately. My hats off to them and hope that one of them fills that management spot that I hope is vacated soon."}
{"text":"First time I had WingStop was in Huston, I loved the Fresh cut fries, and wings were so tasty and fresh. My second time was at this place on Spring Mt, it was my lunch break, I took 2 Coworkers with me and we were craving wings, unfortunately we left the place hungry making fun of the name saying that it should be, \"STOP THESE WINGS\" instead.
Feedback: - Food took 30 minutes to be ready which is not a good idea for a lunch break
                  - Fries they looked so old and oily (old oil made us all sick)
                  - Chicken they are so breaded so you barely feel the chicken 
But the Ice was cold, Soda and Ketchup taste Good."}
{"text":"Called in a Superbowl Sunday order & they told me an hour & 10 minutes ... RIDICULOUS.  Manager got on the phone named Ryan & apologize like the girl I was speaking to was stupid & said they would be ready in 35 mins .... 6:05pm he said. I got there at 6:05 and my order was \"two tickets behind\" ...... So the girl on the phone wasn't stupid Ryan, she was HONEST ...

A girl named Ana apologized to me and offered me a drink while I waited & went to tell Ryan I was there and remind him that he said 6:05 ... He made a rude sarcastic remark to her & she told him that I was right there and could see and hear him ..... Did Ryan apologize?  No. 

I had to watch the entire halftime show on mute at Wingstop, even tho Ana requested that Ryan allow them to turn up the TV for the GUESTS and he said No. HEY RYAN, IF YOU HAD NOT OF LIED TO ME I COULD HAVE CAME AFTER THE HALFTIME SHOW ... Jerk. 

Ryan treats his employees poorly and lies to his guests.  The end."}
{"text":"Wingstop has excellent customer service, I recently went to wingstop to test out the theory of satisfaction guaranteed and was not disappointed. 

Chris, Janella, and crew were very kind and patient with a foreign man from Morocco. They showed true Arizona hospitality."}
{"text":"Come here every couple of months. Try to order online, so you don't have to wait. I usually get the garlic parmesan and louisana rub with some coleslaw as a side. I prefer this place over Buffalo wild wings. The flavors used at wingstop are a step above Buffalo wild wings flavors."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best customer service on Earth! They messed up my order once, and immediately the manager called me and apologized and offered a free meal and more. They're always so happy the second you walk in, and always helpful, I get excited when I order from them knowing how nice they are. Wings are top notch too (try the Mango Habanero), you'll always get a quality order."}
{"text":"Online ordering is great. I can order my food and set a later pick up time. Also I can set the flavor and numbers  of wings up to a certain amount of choices. I see the same manager there most of the time. Employees are always nice and he makes sure the orders are right. I was waiting for my order to finish and I saw him check the receipt and the order was wrong. He quickly threw away the bad food and replaced it correctly fast. Also I was five minutes late from my pick up time and they gave me a call to make sure that everything was ok. I have started to choose wing stop over Buffalo Wild Wings now.l because they can't get their act straight in NLV."}
{"text":"This place is good and all, but some of the employees make me not want to go back. Don't get me wrong, for the most part they are good, but some of them are rude. You should check it out still because the food is off the hook."}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome. I ordered a 12 piece wings and it only came with 10, so I called and they replaced my whole meal and were very nice about it. New food was hot and yummy, except the fries were undercooked both times :( but the customer service made up for it! Thankyou for a great experience."}
{"text":"Not bad on the night we went. The boneless wings had too much breading. Mango habanero sauce was good and spicy. Garlic parmesan not that great the ranch was great. The employees were friendly."}
{"text":"Serive Service is Horrible. Arrived to pick up my order that I placed online and to girls are talking on the phone,while people are in line. When I mention it the girl just rolled her eyes. I got my order I left without a Thank You. I got home and one of two contains was not closed properly and the wings fell all over the floor. I called to get the problem corrected, but they put me on hold and never came back to the phone. I call the 800 number but that was useless also they did not help at all to correct the problem. I went to pick the wings off the floor and they were cold from sitting on the counter at the restaurant. I would never use this place again!!!!!"}
{"text":"A little ridiculous that they don't have a non-bottled water option. If you want water, you have to buy it at an inflated price for a small bottle or buy soda.  Whaaat??!!  I've never been to a restaurant where you couldn't get a plain cup of water.  I wouldn't have had a problem with paying a nominal fee for a water cup but that wasn't even an option.  

Regarding the wings, the boneless ones had a little too much breading but were otherwise fine.  The regular wings were ok but many of them were over fried so that some areas of the chicken were rock hard.  The sauces were good - we ordered the original hot and the bbq.

The staff wasn't rude or anything but wouldn't let my 2 young boys (ages 4 and 8) share a drink.  We were told they each had to get their own.  

Overall, we won't be back.  Wings-N-Things is WAY better!!"}
{"text":"Finally some decent competition for the mediocre BWW.... I've ordered from Wingstop twice since they opened and have been impressed each time.  The wings are a little on the small side (hence the 4 stars rather than 5, but the flavors are GREAT.  I haven't tried them all yet, but the Original Hot, Lousiana Rub and Garlic Parmesan are all really tasty.  Give them a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here before an event at Cupples.  The service was so friendly, and the wings were great (in our party, we had the mild, teriyaki, mango habanero, and BBQ flavors); also enjoyed all the sides (esp. the bourbon baked beans).  Will go back!"}
{"text":"I love the way this store is set up it is so open and inviting. The customer service is ALWAYS. On point and they are super eager to please and the wings are amazing"}
{"text":"Love the cajun wings with cajun fries and adding the cheese sauce omgggg. They staff is friendly aswell. And the old plane parts are cool"}
{"text":"Customer service rocks! But sadly their wings are pretty bad."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait unreasonably long for your order, and don't expect anything but apethy from the cashier and cook."}
{"text":"Ridiculous service. Waited over 30 mins for 10 wings that came out luke warm. When I called back to complain we conveniently got disconnected. My first and LAST time giving them my business."}
{"text":"So, if you've seen my other reviews, you'll know that I dine out often, but only because I've been too busy to cook. However, for the past month or so, I've been laying off fast food/restaurants and instead have been preparing fresh food at home (anything I eat out, I can usually replicate quite well at home). But, this past Wednesday, I decided I didn't want to cook and my youngest daughter, then suggested Wing Stop. We've gone to Wing Stop multiple times in the past, as this is my oldest daughter's favorite place to dine because she loves, loves, loves Buffalo wings.

We arrived around 5pm on Wednesday, June 21st. It wasn't crowded, just a few tables occupied. We were greeted by friendly employees and then we had our order taken. So, I ordered the ten piece wing meal, (all Garlic Parmesan) the 5 piece chicken tenders meal,  plus an additional 4 (for $2.99 per two). And then, my oldest daughter ordered the 8 piece wing meal (mild sauce).

We all received our food fairly quickly. It arrived hot!!! Presentation was great! And, equally important-the food tasted very good! The Louisiana Rub strips had powerful flavor, as did my Garlic Parmesan wings. And what I noted this visit, is that the Parmesan on my wings was plentiful. I was definitely impressed because I have ordered the same wings on multiple occasions and I sometimes have had to request more Parmesan. Not this time, though! My wings were fully covered and so so juicy, tender too! And also, my daughter, the Buffalo wing lover, had not one complaint about her wings, but then again, she never does. 

Overall, wonderful experience, excellent customer service, clean establishment, spotless restrooms,  good music. Of course I'd recommend and of course my family and I will be back. After all, my daughter would have it no other way."}
{"text":"Flavors are #1 in my opinion. Louisiana rub & lemon pepper are the best if you like dry rubs!

The service at this particular location is pretty slow. We waited a little over 20 minutes for our food & we still had 1 more order of fries that we had to wait for. The girl working there said she would bring it out when it was ready, but we were almost done with our wings when we finally decided to go ask her where the last order of our fries were. 

Overall, great wings.. but slow service!"}
{"text":"Two co-workers and I went here for lunch craving some wings. We were the only ones there the entire time. Thought that was a little weird being that it was around noon. My bill was $10+ for a 8 wing combo.  I got Hawaiian and BBQ. The Hawaiian tasted like pineapple, not good. I get that pineapple goes with Hawaii but not on chicken wings. One co-worker got the same thing and thought they weren't good as well. The other got hot and Louisiana rub. He said the rub tasted like crawfish. Fries were pretty good but super salty. I guess I see why nobody was there now."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have great chicken! Bone in and boneless I love the garlic parmesan. You can get there in house made chips or fries and both are phenomenal. And don't forget to try the yeast rolls! Plus they have that 1 million combination coke machine for so many different flavor combination"}
{"text":"Ive been to Panda Express which is tight next door many times , i didnt even realize Wing Stop was so close . My wife and i went there today and you get a lot of great tasting food for your money . I would definitely go there again ."}
{"text":"The best fries ever.  They taste like a unicorn sprinkled its glitter onto a potato.  It was amazing"}
{"text":"New flavor I tried was their very own signature mango habanero wings!! The taste was wing stop alright,sweet yet spicy and tolerable. Their cheese fries are my favorite to pair up with the wings."}
{"text":"This place is medium has a whole at fast. The service is atrocious. My dead grandma bakes me cookies faster when compared to wing stop I get these wings. BTW this is the wing stop in the best buy  parking lot on Maryland and katie.. It's run by 18 year old which is weird cuz they sell beer. they charge you for the dipping sauce. after us getting 24 wings in 35 minutes. and yes I counted and not only that I realized shity to order Bud light in general however we did with these wings only because it goes well with wings outta their poor beer selection. Come on its Vegas.  so I just got my order and they f***** up. I supposed to get half boneless and half bone in and we got all Bonin. so I mentioned something about it and they took away half of our wings to discover that they can't resell them I'm sure. anyhow this is my first time here and we'll definitely be my last and will definitely be my last.  this very well may be the worst experience I've ever had Vegas. Weber owns Wingstop should be thrilled and have the privilege of owning maybe the shittiest restaurant chain in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Asked for wings but got boneless.  Asked for extra crispy extra seasoned fries but got soggy hardly seasoned.  Ranch was watered down.  Ugh... $30 wasted."}
{"text":"This place sucks said 20 minute wait for pick up and it took an hour looks like they completely forgot about us. Go to a different one smh"}
{"text":"Seems like this place is having some growing pains food is what you would expect. Prices mostly in line with portions and quality... but the service needs a boost...never underestimate the power of a a please or thank you and some eye contact. I will give it another chance location is convenient."}
{"text":"Tried boneless wings with mango habanero and BBQ.

The BBQ sauce was pretty good and I'd get it again.

The Mango Habanero, on the other hand... first bite is overly sweet, and then the habanero kicks in... and it wasn't pleasant. I don't mind heat, but these got slathered in blue cheese just to cover up the flavor.

The service was good. I was offered a cup of water while I waited, which was a nice gesture."}
{"text":"I give it one star for customer service, homeless man roaming around begging for money and no one paying attention. Also spent over 35$ and they don't have cups of water but Homeless man drinks for free with his own dirty bottle. Food was good though."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Wing Stop before, decided to give it a try.  The taste wasn't too bad and there were enough flavor choices, but the food here is way too salty.  Probably will dine elsewhere when looking for wings next time."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Waiting on the cashier to take my order as he's on the phone taking an order. I notice the prep/cook...cooking the wings and fries. But she's on her personal phone talking and cooking. I don't think that's wise because she's next to the hot oil. Just for your FYI."}
{"text":"Its been over a tear since I tried the wing stop and I got to say I was quitr dissapointed never been to this location but the taste seemed very diluted on the parmesan seasoned wings.

I will stick with buffalo wild wings. But other then the food wing stop gets extra star for there good customer service."}
{"text":"This location needs some major help. Horrible service. Placed a Togo order online and was told I had to wait an additional 30 minutes for my order to be ready after I got there. A lot of the kitchen staff was standing around didn't seem like they were in a hurry to get orders out in time. Have to go to the Laveen location which is 15 more miles away but has excellent service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in Wingstop. I used to eat at the Spring Mountain and Rainbow location frequently and it was always good. I ordered wings to go and was told it would be ready in 18 minutes which it was. The order was fingers/ fries and 20 Wings... The chicken wings and fingers were very dry neither of them were saucy. I've ordered wings to go from PT's and they were always good and had plenty of sauce on them. I didn't experience bad service, I would say the girl was friendly however she didn't greet me when I stepped up to the register. I am very disappointed and surprised that I have to say that the wings we've had from Pizza Hut and even Albertsons taste better than this order that costed $30 plus dollars. This will be my last visit to this location."}
{"text":"Can you say YUMMY!!!!!! I am a chicken wing fan!!! Loved the chicken Parmesan so delicious!!! You must try it!! I also ordered a few without any sauce on it they were not bad but definitely will be ordering more chicken Parmesan wings!!! The fries were not my favorite but when I go to eat wings that's all I care about."}
{"text":"Ate at Wingstop today, The restaurant is very clean and inviting. The service and staff is very friendly and prompt. Now lets talk food. The wings are so good! The meat of the chicken is tender and moist, the outer coating is seasoned to perfection. And the fries? All I can say is look out McDonalds, because Wingstop fries are sweet and salty and the crunch is to die for!!! We will be regular patrons there."}
{"text":"I didn't realize till we arrived that this is pretty much a fast food restaurant. We had wings only. Half of them original hot and half Louisiana rub. The hot wings seemed kind of an artificial color and weren't remarkable. Actually a bit soggy. The Louisiana were crispy which I liked but we rolled then in the leftover hot sauce to spice them up. We asked for all blue cheese dressing and got two ranch and one BC. I took one of the ranch back up and the gal was a bit put off and threw my unopened ranch in the trash and got me a Bleu cheese. Whatever. Their \"napkins\" are the brown paper towels that we had to awkwardly rip off a single roll at the counter. Okay...maybe two stars..."}
{"text":"Stopped for wings. The place offers a large selection of flavors for bone in and boneless wings. The staff is friendly and their are several TV's so you can watch the games."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The  parmesan garlic wings were so yummy! It was my first time there and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We ordered the 20 piece with 3 flavors, Cajun, Original, and Lemon Pepper. When we got the wings, despite looking different for the flavors, there was only one flavor, SALT. These things were sooo salty it almost gave me a heart attack. The only saving grace to these is that they were cooked good. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Tried to order online. Said uber would deliver. Then it showed up that it had been delivered and I was charged but food never show. They never provided contact info for the driver and nobody called me about anything. Bet some jerk uber driver stole my order and ate it. Don't order from here."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place on several occasions.  I can't comment on any other flavor other than the buffalo... We always order them extra crispy and they are delicious!!  The staff is always friendly.  The place is clean and the wings are made fresh while you wait.  Other than fries, my family hasn't tried anything else on the menu, but as far as wings go, they simply couldn't be better!"}
{"text":"Thank God for Football Season! This has to be my favorite wing spot in my area! Every time I go into Wing Stop this location is always clean and the customer service is always excellent. It's located right off the expressway in a nice little shopping center. It's perfectly located next to a Starbucks! I would say my only dislike is the parking, depending on what time you go the parking is scarce but I would say the quality of food makes up for it. So lets get into the meal!

I always get the 8 wing combo with fries and a drink. My favorite is the lemon pepper wings and the Louisiana Rub. The wings are always fresh and properly coated in seasoning. There is never a lack of delicious flavors and tender meat. The fries are pretty good but the extra bonus is when you add a cup of cheese sauce it totally takes the meal to another level. Also, the side of ranch sauce is always classic. I wish they sold it in a bottle along with the lemon pepper seasoning they would probably make a killing. That stuff is the best thing since sliced bread.

Not to mention they always have the television on the best sports games! Which is perfect for people like me who always forget to order on time and end up having to wait until half time for the games. At least I wont miss much action watching it while I am waiting on my food. Overall I have been to 3 of the wing stops located near my area and hands down this place kills the competition. There is nothing better than football, beer and nice hot wings! 

Oh yeah they have BEER if they get WINE I might just move in :-D"}
{"text":"Got this place for the first time last night. The guy at the counter was trying to be nice but wasn't super friendly. I paid to have ranch with my wings and got home to discover my order did not have ranch in it. The texture of the wings were good. I got the original hot and it was pretty good. Overall I'd give them a second try but maybe for dine in where I can make sure I receive what I paid for."}
{"text":"Called Our orders in ahead. \"Shy\" answered. Very Pleasant, very nice, very calm. She took Her time and took all of Our orders and even suggested getting the combo and $aved Us money. We got there and I absolutely loved the food. Not all WingStop is the same. I've been to a lot of different WingStop locations and by far this is the best. Not only the People but the foods are way better. Keep up the Great Work Shy!!!

{"text":"I ordered Wing Stop for the first time ever and the gentleman that answered the phone and took my order for delivery was named Stanley. He was so rude and interrupted me on more that one occasion. I hung up the phone feeling so angry. I am also in the business of customer service and I know that if you don't treat your customers well they are likely to not return..well guess what.. never going back"}
{"text":"Great wings with an impressive delivery speed. Have not eaten at the shop always ordered out and can't complain. Flavor of wings and size were good. I haven't really had bad wings but I would say I'm a wing guy and that if I had to name bad wing place it'd buffalo wild wings they don't do it for me."}
{"text":"I haven't been up on this side of town in a while since we moved, now the Craig location is closer to me. I seen it on the way from the nail shop a week ago and got extremely excited for whatever reason. 
I placed an order on the way home from work for my usual lemon pepper and husband's mild. The wait time wasn't bad, just like any other joint who makes their food made-to-order. If you've been to any other WingStop there's always going to be a wait. If you'll wait for pizza, why not wait for chicken? *shrug. Anyways, the staff is very helpful. I recognized Angela from the Craig location and Marcus is very humorous. :)"}
{"text":"I live about 2 mins away from here. Came in about an hour before closing and when I got there it seemed that everyone was expecting to leave home early. When I placed my order the lady taking it was very rude and super passive aggressive. Horrible overall Customer experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrid on every level. 

Having never been here before, I checked out the menu online before coming in. The flavor choices looked plentiful and varied, they advertised one of the cool new coke machines, and the fries looked delicious. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

I got there and it was in the middle of what is considered to be \"lunch rush\" time, and it was a day that many people have off or take off (Good Friday), and there were only 2 other people there.  This should of been a red flag.

I step up to the counter (which was in sneezing distance from the front door) and  I place my order. The cashier was either new or not awake, this was a seriously strenuous feat just to order lunch for three people. She kept going in circles, asking me questions that had already been answered, and ignoring questions that I had just to move on with her rehearsed prompts. $33 dollars for 3 meals later, I was waiting for my food. 

The cashier asked me if I wanted my drinks now (sure, I'll take my cups and fill them in the cool new Coke machine with all the options that was advertised on your website, surely it must be around the corner......Nope. They had a min soda station behind the counter.  The Dr. Pepper tasted like the bag was empty and the ice tasted like it was made with filthy tap water. Fortunately I did not have to drink much of it because the 20 oz. cup was 18oz ice. 

They shoved all three meals into one bag, which was so full you couldn't even close it, let alone have enough room to hold the bag closed. Add this to two to-go cups and it was fun trying to get it in and out of my car.  The fries were in an open basket, this made it fun when the unclosable bag fell over in my car. 

I get the food back to work (5 minutes after it was placed in my hand) and we begin to eat our meals. It is here that I find the bag must of been too stuffed to the gills for them to put silly things like napkins or forks in. This made for a very cumbersome meal to (try to) eat. 

The fries were cold, soggy, and tasted like they were coated in sugar. My wings (Hawaiian and teriyaki) were absolutely disgusting. The Hawaiian was savable with ranch, but still tasted like the bottom of someone's shoe. I have been to Hawaii, I have no clue what flavor profile of the state they were trying to emulate, whatever it was, they failed. The Teriyaki was absolutely dreadful. It literally tasted like someone poured BBQ sauce in a dirt field and then rolled chicken in it. I forced myself to eat one whole piece because I was so saddened to of spent so much money on 6 chicken wings, but it was just plain disgusting. The whole meal left a nasty after taste in my mouth.

I feel like I just threw my money down the drain, the food was disgusting, the service was pitiful, and the prices were astronomical.  Never, Never again, will I give this place my money."}
{"text":"This has probably been the worst customer service I have ever had at a wing stop. Jay was very rude and rushed us the entire time. We were the only ones in line by the way. Never going back!"}
{"text":"This is the most horribly managed place I've ever been to. It literally took 3 people to take my order, which they still got wrong. I was trying to be understanding since they were a little busy, but they should be able to handle a task as simple as taking an order. I wouldn't be writing this review if it were the first time, but it seems that this is an on going issue here. What sent me over the edge was the fact that i had to clean my own table! Yup! It says a lot about the management here. It all starts from the top! Get a grip on costumer service and reviews like this wouldn't be necessary, Wingstop!"}
{"text":"Order mostly online so often times I'm in and out the door. Food is great, services is up and down, but again, I am barely here long enough to complain. Recommend to any wing lovers!"}
{"text":"This places had my nostrils on fire because it smelled so good and I couldn't stop smelling in the air. There was a big crowd when we went in here, since the place is fairly new in the air it was to be expected. The perks of this place was that everything is cooked fresh to order and you can see them making your food. The downfalls about my visit here was that the tea machine was low on tea and so the sweet tea tasted awful, which was what I really had a taste for and for anyone who ever reads a review I write on a place that serves fried chicken or wings my biggest pet peeve is feathers on the chicken.

I had feathers on just about every piece of chicken I ordered and they men who were in the back cooking made a huge mistake by using the same bowl without cleaning it to mix peoples wings with different sauces. For me this a no nooooo, because you never know what someone is allergic to or just doesn't like. Overall on taste and flavor it was amazing, I enjoyed the taste of every wing after removing all the feathers. I mean I wasn't about to waste a $10 fry and wing meal. I love the fries....the seasoning they used on them had me hooked that I was licking my fingers but shhhhhh don't tell anyone:) I gave four stars because the food really was good, I just hope management definitely gets things in order especially with this being a new place."}
{"text":"Only reason it's not 1 star is because the food was edible. The 4 guys working there were loud and wildly unprofessional yelling and joking at each other about the basketball game playing on the tvs and singers they liked (I'm their age but come on man, you got customers RIGHT THERE). I ordered 20 wings, 3 flavors. 

First off, the wings were basically something I could get at a Fry's frozen isle and heat up, super dry and a little too crispy to the point I was worried I'd crack a tooth. 

Flavors: The parmesan was just regular wings with glob of parmesan powder thrown on top, that was it, super dry and salty. The regular was just chicken, no real flavor, I thought it would be like a mild flavor but maybe that's on me for not specifying. The lemon was my favorite, it was the only one that had the wings in actual sauce. The fries were very Five Guys like but too much salt poured on. 

My date had wanted to try this place, we tried it, if we ever want wings again we'll go to WingStreet, Buffalo Wild Wings, Ray's Pizza, I mean basically any other fast food joint I've been to has had better wings than here."}
{"text":"Hat take out yesterday Monday night, 8 pm.  too much sauce on wings wow.  and the wings, well dont think I could find any meat on the wings and for the price, not really a great value when you ask for 2 flavors and the expensive small drink.  over all the frys are good as usual and i most likely will go back due to convenience and tolerable but not cravable."}
{"text":"Best location in Vegas! Cleanest spot with the freshest food! Great customer service. Love it, favorite location for wings."}
{"text":"Yep, they have wings... Their flavors are bland, the meat was dry, the fries were OK. I probably won't go back because there are so many other wing places that are better."}
{"text":"i been to alooooot of wingstops in las vegas. and this 1 by far is the best!!! the staff food on point!!! the best in vegas!!! and the manager steve is the bawmb!!!"}
{"text":"The service is horrible I called in my order and when I get there I was almost passed up on my turn in line good thing the guy behind pointed out I was the next person in line. .. The guy that took my order filled my cups with soda and when he gave them to me I asked if he knew which was coke and which was Dr pepper and shrugged his shoulders and said I don't know. .I left it alone got my food and left. .. When I get home my order was wrong even though he repeated it to me 3 times!  Wack!"}
{"text":"Their wings are nasty! We were moving to gilbert over the weekend and my brother suggested we go to wingstop for lunch.  The lady who took our order was very patient with us. It was our first time and we didnt know how much and what to order since the menu is limited and very expensive. We decided to  go with the 24 pcs family meal that comes with 2 order frys, carrots & celery, 1cheese sauce and we also got an order of boneless wings with 1 drink. All of that cost us $43 and some change so expensive right?! 

We had our food to go and our food took 15 min to come out, with that said there was 3 orders ahead of us. When we got home we started eating the food and we noticed there was some discoloration going on with the color of the sauce on the chkn and that the wings tasted funky. The cheese sauce was nasty i mean its just nacho cheese, how could you go wrong? The frys were burnt, soggy and salty. The only thing that was good there were the carrots and celery.

 I felt so bad for the guys cause not even half way through it we stopped eating, we couldnt eat the crap any more it was that bad. Thank goodness there is Chinese food near by so i ordered that to make up for it.  Im telling  you their wings are nasty, you're better off going to hooters at least you'll see a basic chick with tiny shorts and hopefully boobies haha. I give 2 starts for the service, she was good."}
{"text":"Food was good like always. Today I waited a full 30 min of my hour lunch to receive my food. Had to use the restroom but it was occupied. Tried several times and then it dawned on me that I might need a key. Asked the front counter person if I needed a key. He says yes but he couldn't find it. He had to open the men's room and let me in kinda like in the movie Friday. I don't get it women's bathroom was unlocked the entire time. Why only the men's? I visit here infrequently but won't be in a hurry to come back."}
{"text":"I love wings from here! I occasionally go here since they are normally really busy and their wait times are a little ridiculous. But the wings are great, and the staff is nice for the most part!"}
{"text":"I had a deal to get some wings, so I came here on a weekend for dinner (take out) to redeem that deal.  The servers were really nice about redeeming my deal, but weren't very helpful in helping explain the ordering process (describing the combos, explaining if sauces like ranch or blue cheese dressing came with certain orders, etc).  The chicken overall was a little on the dry side, and the sauce was not evenly distributed.  But the taste was really good, and the blue cheese dressing was some of the best I've had.  The fries were not very consistent, some were very thin and crispy, some were very soft and large.  Overall, great flavors, but food consistency could be better."}
{"text":"I love Wing Stop!  My friends and I have been coming to this location for years. Lemon pepper and garlic Parmesan are my favorites. Try it it out for sure!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, not great but def good. A lot of sauces to choice from, mickeys grenades of beer which I haven't seen in years, wish it was more of a bar atmosphere instead of a fast food joint but overall good time"}
{"text":"When we came in and the chairs were covering half the side of the dine-in and it was only 11:10, they close at 12 so i don't know why they're fixing to close so soon. And felicia didn't take the order correctly i asked for 8 plain boneless. And 7 boneless Mango habanero. I received 10 plain and 5 habanero. Not a but difference but I'd like to get what i payed for. Another thing we waited  22 minutes for boneless wings when the regular waiting time is 11 minutes. The didn't greet or say bye like they usually do so didn't recurve the best customer service."}
{"text":"My second time here and I spoke to the assistant manager anout my last visit. She was so apologetic a d e en gave me a free meal for next time....witch i did not adk for nor suggest. Great customer service. Way better today."}
{"text":"One of the BEST locations out there. I live in Los Angeles and always make it a point to stop by this spot when in Vegas.  Have NEVER had a bad experience.  Friendly, pleasant staff..extremely nice management, fresh chicken done just the way you order it, CLEAN table & restrooms.  Really wish some of the ones in Los Angeles would take a page from this locations customer service book."}
{"text":"Ordered wing stop for delivery and not only did it show up super fast, it was delicious! The boneless wings were very meaty and the hickory smoked BBQ was just the right amount of kick. The ranch is homemade and mixes great with the BBQ. But my favorite part of the meal had to be the very delicious southern sweet tea. Tastes just like I was placed in the Carolinas on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"First time I came here the soda machine was down. Second time they were out of both ranch and bleu cheese (but you serve wings?!) Third time was tonite and not only did they short me 10 wings(which I caught before I got to far thankfully) but I was still 2 short after I paid 35 bucks for wings. Not coming back and I'm on the phone with corporate right now. Also I walked out with a customer who didn't even have his online order processed this place definitely needs a over haul"}
{"text":"I am a wing eater and the only kind I eat is bbq and this place I would rank as # 1 in town the flavor is amazing and with the blue chesse dressing (or ranch) you get you will be in heaven."}
{"text":"Wow. I've had some questionable experiences at Wing Stop in the past but tonight it was wonderful dinner!!!  The food was amazing as usual, but tonight the service was incredible. Seriously, this has got to be the best Wing Stop experience we have ever had. Our cashier Karla was super friendly and helpful and the manager, Beth went above and beyond for my daughter and I. I highly recommend this Wing Stop not only for it's great food, but phenomenal service as well. We will definitely be back here again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but the employees were rude. Wingstop needs to get some new employees.  I was really disappointed with the french fries. They were very undercooked. On the plus side, the wings were good."}
{"text":"Favorite Wing Stop Location in Las Vegas because Wings are always on point and their customer service is excellent too! Management is always making sure their customers are happy and that is always appreciated :)"}
{"text":"This wing stop is amazing!!! We bought wings from here today that were just PERFECT!! They were nice and crunchy and cooked perfectly I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This place is so nasty.
Not a clean place to come eat.
I been here 10min and the tables have not been cleaned.
I had to clean my table to sit with my family."}
{"text":"This is my 4 th time here and last time I got it to go and there were 2 wings missing.   When I called to let them know they said they would write my name down and to let them know next time and they would take care of me.   Almost 2 weeks later they remembered my order being short and took care of me without question.   Besides the food being delicious, this type of customer service will keep me coming back and back. Kudos to the management at this wingstop."}
{"text":"Wings are always hot and flavorful. Sam, the owner, is a nice guy too. I've been coming here for years and always enjoy the wings."}
{"text":"Mesa north location. Frozen and revived. Pre-fab. thought there would be so many more sauce choices but no. Shockingly expensive even get charged for dressings and carrot sticks. Good enough when you're hungry and want to power down a lunch that will make you full and skip dinner. Staff was very accommodating. Good people.
Truthfully, if Brandy R would have said anything with substance in her reply to the above post, I wouldn't be writing this. But instead of addressing anything the reply is void. Heck she even thinks I went to a \"West Baseline road\" location. It was Mesa River View. 
I've had my 1st and last visit ON THE SAME DAY!"}
{"text":"20 minutes for a small order and we were the ONLY people waiting for food. -_- annoying but love the rolls"}
{"text":"Wingstop is an easy favorite! The wings are amazing and the service is awesome! Everyone working their is so friendly! The garlic parmesan and the Louisiana rub are my favorites! They are bursting with flavor! I've had other flavors of their wings and they weren't my favorite taste but they still had a lot of flavor. You would think that because it's on Carson St. it would always be non stop busy. Complete opposite, every time I've gone there it wasn't busy. I think they get a lot more takeout order. It's nice because you can order online and go pickup it up in a short amount of time."}
{"text":"Ordered Louisiana Rub wings with no Louisiana Rub. Ordered Mango Habenero with barely any sauce. Ordered Lemon Pepper fries with no lemon pepper seasoning. Wings over cooked and extra crunchy. Had to add BBQ sauce to the Louisiana Rub wings. Didn't even finish the meal. Thanks Wingstop!"}
{"text":"Wings were soggy and cold. Even when ordered fresh. Completely Under sauced. Not the first from this location unfortunately. Will be going to different location."}
{"text":"We will usually drop $25 here for two of us. The wings are pretty good and they have lots of varieties. The fries and veggie sticks are good. It's kinda pricey and this isn't somewhere I would eat often."}
{"text":"After being a loyal loyal customer and have frequent visits to other establishments, this location is by far the worst. The food MAY be good but this visit was not good. First we placed a normal order, nothing fancy, but we told them no seasoning on the fries because we don't like seasoning. And we were told 18 mins, so 20 minutes goes by and we were told another 7 minutes. Mean while other people came in and ordered and got their food first while we were still waiting! Not to mention there was no one inside when we got there and placed our order. So 10 minutes goes by after the super passive aggressive, bad attitude, cashier told us 7 minutes. So I ultimately decided just to cancel my order and get money back. When I went up to cancel my order, the cashier said my order was ready, I said it was too late, I explained the inaccurate time and she made a face like that wasn't the case. None the less we will NOT be back here again, unless they change management."}
{"text":"First tried to order delivery from the one on Craig, guess they're not doing delivery yetSo I Ordered from here for delivery for the first time. Food was hot, my order was right, Fries were fresh. I do only live about 5 minutes away but still. My food came within 30-40 min of ordering. They use UBER EATS for delivery. Super happy with the whole experience. Wasn't sure how Wingstop delivery would be since they just started doing it, but I'm very pleasantly surprised! Will order again!"}
{"text":"Always consistent and reliable for decent, crispy wings.  They've always cooked our wings fresh and the wait is reasonable for freshly prepped food.  My favorite sauce is Parmesan Garlic although it must be so bad for me.  Fries are not crispy but have decent potato flavor with a sweet/savory sprinkle salt.   Service is efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Cashier was helping another individual with his order, then came my turn. As I stepped up to the register, he asked, \"what can I get for you?\" 

Two seconds into my sentence, he interrupts me and exclaims \"CAN I GET A NAME FOR THE ORDER?\" He was very loud and even the other customers looked over. 

Gave him my name, but I wasn't so please so I asked him \"why are you talking like that\" to which he said \"a lot of times, people can't hear me!\" 

Cashier had a lot of attitude, so I ended up not ordering food in fear of him spitting on or doing something to it."}
{"text":"Food is nowhere near as good as they claim. Why it was voted best wings in Cleveland for 2014 I have no idea! Just mediocre. We tried 5 flavors, with regular wings and boneless wings, the fries and the bread. I'm just not impressed. Not awful by any means, but not great"}
{"text":"I love wing stop wings but this location sucks bad! I went after work last night because I was tired and didn't want to cook of course. Well first things first I am a Chef and know how long some wings should take, well they took forever about 40min to come out and it wasn't even busy. That alone made me curious to if my wings are sitting or going to be extremely over cooked. Well I got home ready to eat and took a bite of my first wing, it was beyond over cooked. So over cooked I couldn't even eat it it was like trying to eat a rock. There are no wing stops close to my house so I had to go to this location but I will never go back again. Hopefully all locations are not like this one. Also there was a couple that came in about five minutes after me and sat at the bar, they got their food 10 minutes before me that pissed me off as well. Just a bad wing stop all around from FOH to BOH... Avoid them and go else where."}
{"text":"Amazing service & even better grub! This is definitely a go-to place for me! Try it out- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time here and the wings are amazing! The cashier Carla was amazing! Very friend and attentive. She made sure our drinks were full and made sure we got the right meal that was the Cheapest. She was very friendly too and told us which wings to try next time. Lemon pepper wings are bomb.com and so were the fries!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy extremely slow service this is your place.  We waited so long the ice nearly melted in our drinks.  I mean it wasn't busy at all yet the staff of three was practically never seen. If you place your order an hour plus in advanced be prepared to wait an hour in the store when you come to pick it up. I am surprised that this place is is still in business. A+ for slow service A+ for taking 2 hours to get 20 wings made with little to no customers"}
{"text":"Waited for 30 minutes to get wings that taste like crap. The fries taste weird. The drinks are watered down. Dissatisfied and disappointed at the customer service. Save yourself and go to buffalo wild wings."}
{"text":"Excellent! Reminds me of the late night wing spots I use to frequent in college at FAMU!"}
{"text":"I ordered Xtra crispy wings and specifically told the girl who took my order that I wanted them really really well done because U had ordered previously and they weren't well done. I was told it would take 30 mins, I came to pick up 30 mins later to not crispy wings, I let the cashier know they weren't crispy, and the girl who took my order over the phone, said (with an attitude) so what's the issue because I told them to make them xtra crispy, they're extra crispy. She turned my feedback into an argument and then proceeded to disagree with me looking at the wings touching them and still believing they were not how I ordered. Disgusting lack of customer service, I asked for her name and she said I'm not talking to you, as if I was wrong for being mad that she had an initial attitude and tried to defend her taking the order.  Btw she's short latin dark hair kinda short , she worked at 8pm on  on 11/13/17. I had to tell my uber driver that I paid $32 to bring me to WS and back home to cancel, so I was charged $32 on top of having to order another $16 uber back. Disgraceful the only thing positive I can say is the cook ,josh was extremely helpful and fixed the order, and Denise the cashier who I paid was xtremely kind, but the little Latin girl who took my phone order and was very argumentative and Nasty is horrible!"}
{"text":"They take wings to another level, saucing and tossing the freshest flavors you crave along the way."}
{"text":"Compared to others this wingstop is very clean, friendly and accommodating! We've always had a great experience! If we want to watch the Suns Game (which isn't first choice in comparison to Warriors to be put on the big screen) they make it an effort to change the channel. As any human being, they may make minor mistakes on the way but the difference is they OWN it and start a new. I love this location! Wings are great and staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"SUPER great costumer service. Traveled here from Cali for a funeral at the National Cemetery.  These folks were kind, personable, and friendly. The Resturaunt was clean and cool.... important for Arizona. Thank you Isaiah and Miguel, for making our quick stop in Chandler, AZ perfect!"}
{"text":"Bone in wings are solid 8 out of 10 
Boneless wings are a solid 10 bigger boneless wings Iv scene and the favors are great ...
No complaints here"}
{"text":"Thank God for their online ordering system I can place the order ahead of time and not have to wait 20-30 mins (depending on how busy they are) for my food! I places my order this morning so all I had to do was drive to the store and pick it up. Really smart specially when you have limited time when it comes to lunch breaks."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge wing eater, but every once and awhile my wife gets a craving, so you know the saying..,compromise is key!  Anyways, the wings here are pretty good.  Try the Louisiana Rub, they are the best of the bunch and always come crispy with a nicely seasoned rub.  My only complaint is that the wings with sauce always seem like they should of been left to crisp up for a couple more minutes.  Sometimes they seem a little too mushy for my taste, but each his own.  This chain is new to the area, offering solid wings and service."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Dominique was awesome. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the wait. Pretty long wait to get my food."}
{"text":"Terrible service waitress took our order and never saw her after that.  Had to go to bar to get my own water.  This happen to us the last time we were here as well.  Guess we need to find a berets place with good service!"}
{"text":"I love wingstop, but this wingstop was just terrible! We decided to order from here because we knew it had just opened. I ordered and they told me they would be ready in 10 minutes, so I decided to give them a little time before I left to pick up my order. When I got there, I asked for my order, and they said it would be a minute. They had some bags on the counter already bagged up, and 15 minutes later after sitting there waiting for them to call my name, I asked \"is my food ready\" they said oh yes it's right here. THE BAG WAS SITTING THERE THE WHOLE TIME EVER SINCE I WALKED IN!!!!! I left a little irritated and annoyed at the fact that they didn't even bother to check when I asked in the first place and on top of that the employees were RUDE! I love wingstop but this location needs some training. The fries didn't even taste good, they weren't wingstop fries. Save yourself the headache and save yourself from the flavorless food, go to t-bird or christown mall."}
{"text":"30 minutes on hold thats crazy. Worst customer service ever. On my way to atl wings and im still on hold, just want to find out how long that girl is gonna take. Whatever guys never going back at that place with my family"}
{"text":"We ordered a meal through an outside app and it said it came with fries. The workers insisted you had to choose fries as one of the sides but this was not possible through the app. They still refused us a thing of fries and lost us as customers. Also the coleslaw is dry and the beans are funky."}
{"text":"This location is lame! Called the night before to place a large catering order so we could provide lunch for our staff. Apparently, they will not take large orders over the phone. They require you to come pay in person, which then means you have to waste time waiting for them to cook the large order. I offered to give credit card info so that it was paid for, but they still refused. I cannot understand a business refusing $200 worth of orders. 

Interestingly, the location at Santa Fe Station  was easily able to accommodate this order without a problem. 

The management at this store needs to go back to school and learn what customer service means!"}
{"text":"My food was cooked Super fast and great service!!!!                       
Cashiers are very friendly"}
{"text":"Food is good, employees are clueless and rude. I came in to order food to go, and was told 8-10 minutes. It took just over 30. I would've been fine with it had all the girls not been standing around and chatting the whole time."}
{"text":"Wings were fine as was the service but prices are stupid. Cost $18 for 12 wings and one beer. Oh, also cost .89 for one ranch dressing to go with the order of Wings, not for extra ranch but for one to go with my wings. Cheap bastards, ranch comes with the order, not an add-on as also does carrots and celery. Native is going to open back up across the street so you might want to pickup your game."}
{"text":"Ok second trip to WINGSTOP since the opening last year.  I ordered take out and was told it would be 20 minutes.  I thought that was a long wait at first but then I thought..  freshness - perhaps!?   There were only a few others in the restaurant - that also ordered take out. The woman who took my order was lovely and very friendly.  I was surprised at the menu.. something I didn't notice before.  If you want just an order of wings the minimum is \"8\" not \"6\" you only get 6 if you get a combo. I don't understand why that is but ok.   The fries were better. .. not over-salted.   I tried the lemon pepper - which I LOVED~!  and the mango habanero ..  which were disappointing.. no heat what so ever.    

I think more flavored should offered.  I think there is 10 .. its not enough.  When you specialize in \"wings\" you need more flavors.  10 flavors is not enough to keep me coming back.

Any who...   

ok - WINGSTOP ..  got it going on .. happy with my food and visit today. Thank you..."}
{"text":"I come here just for these voodoo fries!!!! (Wings are great too though). The staff is always quick and friendly. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Okay...ladies and gentleman, when I was a child in high school I would go almost three or four times a week to that place with a Buffalo which has these \"wild wings.\" I've grown up, I've matured and I'm now a loyal Wing Stop-er. In all honesty, I've been taken back by how much I have started to love this joint. I haven't been to any other one, so this is my review of this fairly new location conveniently near the UNLV campus, easy access coming from school. The place has a good size, I came here and watched a UNLV basketball game and the environment was just right. There's a bar for drinks and of course the wings.

As soon as you walk on in, you are greeted with cheer. It doesn't feel like that greeting where they employees are forced to ask you how you're doing as part of their job description. I'm sure it's somewhere in there, but the times I've been there I've never felt like the welcome was never genuine. That is my humble opinion. This isn' necessarily a sit down and order restaurant, but you go on in and order at the front counter. The choices are endless, they have bone in wings, boneless wings and chicken tenders. Combos come with a side, usually a generous portion of fries or if you prefer fried mushrooms or pickles. It's all there. 

So you order at the counter and find your seat with a number, you wait for a fair amount of time and you are greeted by name with your food. The sauces I've had are lemon pepper, parmesan garlic, original hot, hickory smoked BBQ and mild. None of them have been a disappointment. The first time I came here, I'll say I wasn't the biggest fan of the boneless wings. There was little too much breading, but it didn't ruin my virgin experience. I say get the bone-in wings because the wings are big, they are bigger than that other place everyone's on the nuts of. Your meal COMES WITH ranch, and not small, dainty container but a generous portion of ranch as your dipping sauce. 

I'm in love with wing stop. It is my new abode for wings. I prefer this over any other wing joint I've had in a while, because I feel like I'm welcomed and of course they give you the bang for your buck. Eat here, enjoy some beer and don't forget to thank them so graciously as you leave. Because you'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed.  When you wait thirty minutes for food it should be hot.  nope.  Barely luke warm.  We were shorted on the wing count and the fingers weren't 
prepared properly.  No plain for the baby.  Waited another fifteen minutes and hot the plain.  At least the plain was hot.  Not sure if I'll try this place again."}
{"text":"Food was great! Wings and fries were still hot, but the staff was unfriendly. They weren't rude or disrespectful, but I am the kind of person that I would like a smile at least from the employee. I didn't felt welcomed at all. I hope they were having a bad day because I moved close so would probably go back."}
{"text":"My second time trying wingstop. Honestly I don't know why I try places twice even after I didn't like it the first time. But you live and you learn. Both times were disappointing. PP rave about this place, but I have had WAY better. Ordered the mango habanero wings and the garlic parmesan. You want good wings go to Hooters. They are the true wing masters. Wont catch me here a 3rd time!"}
{"text":"Keep driving....18 minutes to cook 6 wings, are ya kidding me!?  I ordered the garlic parmesan wings and basically I got a deep fried wing with a load of parmesan cheese dumped on top of it, not even seasoned. If I wanted a fried wing thrown in a basket with cheese, I could have just done that myself and not paid $10 for it."}
{"text":"My Wing Stop experiences are satisfactory but seldom go the extra mile. The wings are good, but they don't really seem much better than wings you could get anywhere else. The wait is always long, which is understandable but annoying nonetheless. The fries are decent and are usually the best side to get, because if you try ordering veggies the portion size will disappoint you. The prices aren't great, but Wing Stop is worth visiting occasionally."}
{"text":"I'm rating based off service and their food.   I've heard a lot of hype from my friends so I decided to give it a shot.  And I was utterly disappointed.
    I ended up getting their 8 wing combo which came out to be little over $10, which is not bad.  Got two flavors:  Louisiana rub and garlic parm.  Order took a lil while, which I expected ( a lil over/under 10 mins albeit the place was pretty much empty but I kept thinking they make it fresh ).  Anyways my order arrived and immediately I noticed the order did not looked right.  I know Louisiana rub and what I got was NOT Louisiana rub.  So I proceeded to tell the server to get it corrected, he agreed said he'd never seen Louisiana rub like that ( the rub was non existant, pretty much they gave me oily wings with pepper and some salt ).  He went to the kitchen, spoke to the cook came back a few mins later and to my surprise told me okay here you go.  I was like the same ones?  He then said yup the cook says that's how it looks.
    So I ended up unsatisfied.  Even my friend tried them,  said that does not taste like Louisiana rub.  In all a bad experience, the server tried, but the cook made it for a bad outing.  If I want wings I'll stick to BDubs, you can never go wrong with their Caribbean jerk or mango habanero..."}
{"text":"Wings were amazing as usual. As far as the service you get, not very impressed. When I came to pick up my food the cashier seemed very scrambled. Also as part of my meal, I got a 20 oz drink and every flavor was out and my only option was tea."}
{"text":"Solid wings and the fries are amazing. This place does not have the sheer variety of of places like Steak and Lube, but the wings it does make are made very well. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Wing stop is legit. Today I ordered Togo. I got garlic Parmesan and Hawaiian. Bomb!! Chicken is crispy and flavors are on point. The season fries is a must it goes really good with the wings. And dipping sauce is ranch all day!! My only complaint is they take way to long to fill an order. I would recommend to call ahead because 30-45 min wait is not cool!"}
{"text":"Good like any BWW... but always very slow service. Haven't been here once since they opened where the waitress get to our tables without a long time of waiting."}
{"text":"Just tried out Wing-stop and to be honest, it is not all that delicious. I had the Spicy Korean and Garlic Parmesan, both mediocre and a rip off for 8 little chicken nuggets. If you do go, I suggest getting bone-in, instead of boneless. Also, the fries are terrible."}
{"text":"Haven't ate my food as of yet couldn't wait to write my review on customer service of an employee... walked in to pick up a to go order.  At this time while filling up my beverage I notice do it yourself ketchup at this time I remembered I'd like some ketchup. So I kindly asked the employee closest to the register\" can I have some ketchup\" she comes back with one ketchup at this time I ask for another . She went to get another with a complete attitude then says \"u should have said more then one\" what I wanted to say and what I said were two different things but I replied\" I asked for some n some usually means more then 1\" her response was \"well there's some inside\" some smart ass remark n not good customer service... maybe teach your employees some comprehension skills n knowing the difference between a/some/sum"}
{"text":"Placed a call at 1100pm was told 18 minutes I was on time why didn't I receive my food until 35 after almost double the time but here it is 4 employees on duty but only two inside other 2 outside socializing with friends only to come running in after me... wass an older couple there eating guess they ordered extra only to have to be refunded cause it was gone take longer then expected,, hmm wonder y.... I'll bring my business to one of the many other locations from now on ... food taste no different then any other wing stop"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing! They told us 18 minutes for carry out and we have been sitting here for over 30 minutes now."}
{"text":"Worst service i have received. I order online for delivery. For one i never got the order so I called the store and told them I never received the order and never gotten a call from the driver. The very nice woman who answered the phone crystal i believe showed sympathy and advise would call me back which she did. She told me her manager would call the driver and see what's going on. About 30 mins go by still no food and no call. So i call back and crystal answer again and she advise that her manager said they would refund me the money. I told her i didnt want the refund just the food. Im at work and that i order for myself and 2 other people. She said ill have my manager call you back. An 1 hour later still no call so i call back up there again. And crystal answer and im furious at this point. I have no food and my money was gone. So she tells me that her manager said that uber (third party company they deliver through) would refund me. I told her wingstop took the money out my account not uber. I would need my money back or the food, i would prefer the food. So she said the manager would call. NEVER received a call from the manager. Only played this he said she said thing. Finally after going hungry all day because i never received a call. I get off work and call again. Finally spoke to a manager and she was rushing me off the phone. And stated we have your information uber will refund you. They will send you and email. Never got that email until the next day. It still came from wingstop. It's been a week now and i have still not received my food or my money back. I love wingstop but this is unacceptable. I will not be spending my money at this location no more. I've never had this issue with bdubs or any other place. Looks like I'm out $40 for food I never received. I hope the delivery driver had a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out through my phone and I got out of work earlier then expected, I gave them a call I was about 5 minutes away and they said no problem! I was greeted by a black male who was very friendly. Great place will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"One star because I have to. I am very disappointed not just with the speed but the abundantly poor customer service. Telling someone it will be 17 minutes and having them watch every person behind them get their food for over 35 minutes is one thing. But to ask not once but twice why we are standing at the counter is plain rude. We are kind people who did not roll our eyes or raise our voices. (Although another gentleman did) we figure it's fine, they will probably throw something extra in and apologize. They did not offer anything extra. Did not smile. And did not even apologize exactly 42 minutes later. It's Wingstop yes. But we spent money and a good attitude would have been enough kindness for us to look over the wait and the cold potato twisters and you simply asking \"does this look like the order you're waiting for?\" Thank God for Jesus because thats the only thing that brought me peace."}
{"text":"This place is complete garbage. While I write this review I have been waiting for over an hour. Me and my friends came in to get some wings and still haven't got any of our food. This is ridiculous. Don't come to this shit show for food. Not worth it.

Edit: We ended up getting a full refund. Lady in the front didnt even apologize and said she didn't want to deal with this shit as she walked away from me. Manager had to come up and give us our refund. Horrible service and I will never go here again. Fucking ridiculous."}
{"text":"I ordered my wings to be picked up by the time I got off work and on my way home.  And when I got there they were ready to go for me.  The place was really clean, alot of space, and the atmosphere was very welcoming.  The only drawback is when speaking to the young lady at the counter you really can't hear her because of the tvs that are on and the noise from the meals being prepped. I think maybe they need to shut that part off to eliminate some of that extra noise when speaking to someone at that counter.  

I didn't get any combo meals because I didn't want my fries to be sitting there although they had my wings ready when I arrive but the fries probably wouldn't be cold.  I ordered the 20 piece boneless wings alone and ordered 10 hot and 10 of the Louisiana cajun rub.  The wings were a pretty descent size but nothing as big as Buffalo Wild Wings but they weren't too little.  The hot wings were pretty good and the since it was my first time trying to Louisiana rub it was pretty good too.  However one of them seemed to have too much salt on them and it probably was the Louisiana rub.  My tolerance for salt has significantly been reduced because of my high blood pressure so I'm not a big salt fan anymore.  So I'm not sure if it actually was too salty or it was just my taste buds.

SInce this is the closest one to my house I probably be returning on service alone which goes a long way with me.  I usually prefer the other wing place (Buffalo Wild Wings) because their wings are alot bigger and meatier."}
{"text":"Had some guys over for some football watching and placed a large order for carry out online. Everything was perfect! 60 wings, fries, 2 orders of veggies, and a large potato salad. Not one thing was messed up and everything tasted great! The store was clean and the staff was friendly also. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"They are overpriced for a regular 6 piece and fries, rather go to bdubs and get triple the amount for the price we pay here.    Plus their wings were really greasy . And French fries are soggy ."}
{"text":"garlic parmesan is thee bomb ... just remember its made freshly & can take up to 20 minutes so if hungry order before arrival"}
{"text":"These wings are spectacular! I'm a fried chicken critic, but these folk are cooking fresh juicy hot wings to order and to perfection!

Although their wings are good, as a vegan of one year, looking back after losing 90 pounds, even though this is a wing spot, they can still have at least one vegan option."}
{"text":"We had recently did an online order in advance to Wing Stop for the superbowl party at my friends house. Our order consisted of the 100 piece wing with 3 sides. We had varied quantities of wings for 5 different flavors, 1 seasoned fries, 1 parmesan fries, 2 veggie sticksand 1 potato salad side. 

We put in our order to be picked up at 0300P. I had arrived a bit early (maybe 0240P) and there was a line out the door. To the side, there was a rack with orders all done. Seeing another person asking for their order on the side for pick up, I did as well. I was told my order was being cooked and I needed the ID and credit (at least a picture) of the one it was ordered with. Easily accomplished as my friend sent it to me within a few minutes, before the order was complete. Showed the worker the ID and the last 4 digits of the credit card and off I went with 3 full bags of food. 

We had at least 6-8 boxes of wings with 3 trays of sides and 1 container of potato salad. Quite a lot of food. We had 8 people. Had about 20ish wings left at the end with some sides. To give an idea on how much it feeds. 

Flavors we got was mango habanero, garlic parmesan, lemon pepper, original hot, Louisiana rub. Garlic parmesan and lemon pepper are two that are usually ordered. Original hot reminded me of tobacco/buffalo sauce. Louisiana had a Cajun flavor to it. Mango habanero was probably most disappointing. I don't recall it being much spicy at all. Wonder if we got the wrong one in the order... LOL o well... wings were good overall as per usual. 

The fries were soft by the time I got the order. Not sure if they were sitting in the bag sealed closed before wings were finished. They were not crispy even when I was snacking them in the car as soon as I got the order. I tried to open the bags to keep it crispy too but I guess damage was done before I even got the order. Was a bit disappointment as I usually really like the fries

Not bad overall considering it was before Superbowl. They were pretty on top of their orders. At least they weren't behind, which was good."}
{"text":"And in here for wings...not 1 person in here 22 minute wait...wings are decent and a little salty...place seems clean. Big TVs but just ok service...

17 minute wait with people in kitchen behind register doing absolutely nothing...matter of fact where are they making the wings? 

10 wings in the deep fryer max 2 mins to cook shake with seasoning, done 1 min. Later.."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better. MUCH BETTER.

The Wing Stop chain has decided to branch out and try a SPORTS version of their original place...

I understand we went there on the second day but we decided not to overwhelm anyone so we sat up at the bar.

Yes everyone was pleasant. But there is a fine line to having 5 (yes five) people waiting on you and good customer service. Every time I turned to my hubby and started to say something to him someone new was asking me a question.

It felt like they were getting ready to tell me I did not have enough FLAIR on.

Anyway...
The chicken:
I ordered the three piece boneless plain. Sounds boring but I like spice and hubby does not. 
They hand batter here. It's more like a country buttermilk recipe without the black pepper part. There boneless at this location are large chicken strips. I tasted them (see my pics) and they were good.

The sauces:
The garlic parm sauce was disgusting. It taste like mayo, paste, shake parm and who knows what mixed into a chunky glue. 
My hand went up immediately and one of the five helper guys flew to my rescue. I explained it taste spoiled and I asked for Teriyaki. It kinda tasted ok. Just a really thick syrup like sweet soy sauce.
I ordered the regular hot sauce. It was ok. It had just the right amount of kick but not too much vinegar. It seemed a little watery but at least it was not thick.

The fries:
Standard fresh cut fries. I don't remember salt or pepper being on them. I'm not a salt fan so I would remember.

Carrots and celery:
For the 99 cents you pay for them I actually got about ten pieces of each which seems odd lol.

Sooo...I understand the sports bar concept and idea you are going for but you picked a horrible parking lot. (It's in Best Buys parking lot). I understand all the employees need to be trained but like 20+ all during the day (we went at lunch there were two tables filled)? 

PS the guys...I don't know which one...rang our order under Carry Out...thus the machine gave us no spot to place a tip when we used our card. Odd.

We won't be back. Don't really care about all that FLAIR. And the food is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Love this place, the wings are super legit!! never leaves me disappointed every time I come in to order. . ."}
{"text":"Great location with ease of online ordering. Food was consistent and good."}
{"text":"There doesn't exist a better boneless wing than at Wingstop IMO. BWW, a well known place to have wings doesn't hold a candle to this place. Everything is always made to order. They only do wings and they do them well. I love the garlic parmesan boneless wings, as well as many others. They have a small selection of beers to choose from. Their fries are pretty different from normal places. They have a garlic, slightly spicy, salty and sugar sweet mixture. I've tried to make it at home and I just can't quite get it right. 10/10.  Compared to places like Wings over Madison (not a fan at all) and BWW I would always choose this place. Although, the service could absolutely be a bit friendlier."}
{"text":"The wings....good. The customer service when things go wrong...bad! 

We all know that sometimes things go wrong but it's how a company resolves a bad situation that matters. For me customer service means more than how great the food is. 

First, they gave us the wrong food for a carry-out order so we were inconvenienced by having to return the wrong wings to pick up the wings we ordered. No compensation offered.

Second, they charged my credit card three times. Two for the same about and one for under $2. No compensation offered for having to return again to clear up one of the charges.

Third, the general manager Morgan doesn't return calls or show any care to make things right. 

The Chandler, AZ establishment needs to empower their employees so Moragan doesn't have to be bothered for wrongly charging a customer. Seriously, I paid $54.26 for 30 wings, fries, carrots and celery. The wings were no where near that great.

From now on when I want wings, I will go to Native New Yorker. WingStop is not worth it....three visits and two went wrong with no compensation offered. Not even a free order of fries."}
{"text":"This location takes forever to give us our food every time we come here. My boyfriend insists on coming here every time though and I hate it because we always end up waiting well over 30-40 mins for our food. This last time we placed an order to be picked up so we wouldn't have to wait long, and when we arrived our food was still not ready. We waited 45 more minutes, which is ridiculous if you called the order in, until we finally asked the cashier what happened to our order. Turned out they lost the ticket in the kitchen so we were basically waiting there for nothing. This is the last time I'll be coming here. The food is not that great to be waiting 40 mins for."}
{"text":"Ugh.... The customer service is not great but the food is great if they get it right. Have asked to speak to a manager numerous times being told the owner is the manager yet no call back :(  if I ever get a response and see changes I will change my review. After leaving three messages you would think the owner would care enough to call back."}
{"text":"Omg....so gross!!! My bf, roommate and I tried this place friday night (takeout). First of all they forgot to give us ranch, and we were out, typical luck.  My bf called to tell them about the ranch, and the girl said \"oh you can come back and get it\", we were not about to go back then she said \" oh ill put your name on the book, so you can get it some other time\". Who just gets ranch?! I do feel bad cause my bf wasted his money!!! The wings i got were mild, and not tastey at all! I had to add some of my sauce to it, so I can eat it. My bf, who loves wings didnt even finish his, and the only person who was content was my roommate. Good for her but no never will go back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I went on a night where everyone's order was wrong. They were so slow."}
{"text":"The people working here are rude but the food is good enough to keep you coming back; wings are tasty, crispy and saucy but nothing too extraordinary. Where they really shine is in the sides, potato salad and baked beans are amazing! The seasoned fries are pretty nom-worthy as well."}
{"text":"This is our second time being here for the money you get plenty of food and the wing sauces they have are good. Overall an excellent value, will come back again. The mango habanero sauce is my fav than comes the teriyaki  forget the Cajun sauce."}
{"text":"The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen, they must be off of baby chicks.  I thought it was getting punked, actually LOL.  Never to be back"}
{"text":"This is the worst wing stop ever as far as customer service goes. I tried to call to place an order so that it would be ready when I got there. The phone rang and rang and rang but no answer so I just went over there to order. They only took cash bc all card readers were out of service so they had to turn a lot of customers away. Thank goodness I had cash! So I ordered and was told it would be a 15-18 min wait! No I waited 30 min to get my food! Rediculous!!!"}
{"text":"Service & product continue to decline. I've been eating here since they opened. Loved the previous WS that was at the old cedar center years ago. Was so happy they came back!!  Ate there several times when they first opened. Great service, great wings!!!  Over time it's rapidly deteriorated. Have been left on hold for 5 minutes b4 I hung up and went somewhere else. When they do answer the phone & take the order they say 17 minutes. Have waited as long as 40!!!  But ok the garlic Parmesan wings are worth it. Until today.... wings underdone and soggy. So disappointing!!"}
{"text":"I think their wings are AWESOME.  Much better than BW3 and I actually like that place a lot as well. I'm shocked this place doesn't have a five star rating as their service has always been on point, consistent, and their staff consists of the friendly-tattoo-guy types which is great IMHO. I usually order for takeout but the restaurant seems clean and with a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really likw this location versus some of the others in town. The staff is always friendly and helpful. It's also quick with getting your order. I will definitely return here"}
{"text":"We ordered from the online menu and when got there to pick up food the prices were somewhat higher. They need to correct the menu prices online. The burrito I had was alright but not much in it. Hardly any side lettuce and a small thin slice of tomato on the lettuce. For the price we have had better and will not go there again."}
{"text":"First time trying and not going there ever again. Got both orders wrong. Should have checked before leaving and was 45 min away before we acually opened it up. And these people want $15 an hr."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has low ratings. Never had an issues with my order or wings here. Service has been always good and sometime above average even on busy days! I personally enjoyed every bit of this place"}
{"text":"Driving behind the restaurant, seen the coworkers out in the back smoking weed not even trying to hide, yes you can smell it.  I know it's legal but c'mon.  At least don't go out in full uniform. (Don't they drug test?)"}
{"text":"Very good wings quick and easy ordered online wings were done by the time the suggested you stop in... nice very crispy wings like I like. Only complaint is I wish they put more sauce on them so I will ask for more sauce next time I stop in"}
{"text":"I am super mad right now cause I place an order for delivery (as you might not now, they start to do delivery now ), two hours later I called the store to check how come my order is still not here. And then they told me the uber driver was there but I canceled the order!  Why will I cancel my order and call the store complain about I haven't get my order yet!  I am super upset cause that order was for all co worker at our store and we all missed our lunch time just because of that!  I mean if they decided to do delivery they should make sure the system is good and avoid this happen. They never notice me anything in those two hour which even pissed me off more. I'm so upset right now."}
{"text":"The cashier Amley was so bad, I asked for my money back and left. She was terrible. Instead of helping me with my order she gave me attitude. She should never be in the front of the house."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST wings!  They are huge, crispy and the sauces and dry rubs are fantastic!  Plus, they have Sunday ticket and show every game, happy girl here!  They have great customer service and ask if you need anything else even though it's a fast casual set up.  

Just an FYI, that it was FREEZING inside!  They did turn the air up upon request but it was still really cold.  I also wish they had better napkins than the paper towel roll, it's not very helpful with saucy wings (and they are scratchy on my girly face)."}
{"text":"Totally had a pig out fest the other night. 

We ordered the combo meal for two which came with 12 wings, fries, and a soda. 

The 12 wings we got 1/2 garlic parmesan and 1/2 medium hot sauce. 

Of course the wings were amazing. They gave us a side of ranch dipping sauce which made it even more delicious. 

I gave this place 3 stars because our fries were extremely soggy. No one likes soggy fries! 

If you're into soda, tons of people get a kick out of their soda machine which has multiple flavor choices and syrups with a press of a button. It's definitely \"hi-tech\" on their end."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: fast-food chicken wings.

Same quality chicken wings as Buffalo Wild Wings (better fries even), for less. Limited seating but they're open late. They even have bottled and tap beer. Perfect place for the college crowd. You'll hate yourself later, but boy do they taste good going down."}
{"text":"Super slow service every time I order from this Wing Stop....order was supposed to be ready at 8pm and it's currently 8:12p and Im pretty sure it won't be ready anytime soon"}
{"text":"Love the Louisiana dry rub. Love their fries, but they are different - ie a sweet seasoning. Gotta know what you're getting into. Appears many reviewers do not. 
We always online so it's ready on arrival - otherwise it takes a while (which means they cook to order.)
We've always been well taken care of at this location."}
{"text":"Wings were great! 

Only 3 stars because the customer service was horrible. The manager, who looked like he was a teenager and arms covered with tattoos (doesn't look very professional, maybe a long sleeve shirt would have helped him look more professional since his attitude didn't help), had a smart a** attitude and was rude. When we got back to office with our food, they completely screwed up our order. 

My coworkers and I will be eating wing stop again, BUT at another location, hopefully one with better customer service ."}
{"text":"This place is a really nice location and has a lot is tv's to view. I ordered out though so I am only judging it on that. The Original Hot wings were not so spicy enough, lacking sauce. On the other side though the lemon pepper had so much spice I could barely eat them, so I took a pic. This place is new and it just shows how un-experienced this crew is although they were nice. The price of the wings is high and Wingstops need to be on point when it comes to the food. The place is one of the only places open til 12 though which is nice and the reason I went there. They also sell beer and have a nice set of surrounding tv's but since I ordered out I it's only based on food grade."}
{"text":"For some quick wings, I wouldn't mind it here. Got an order of 15 hot wings to share with my sister and she loved it because it was extremely crispy but it was only like that because the wings aren't really meaty. 

Prices were decent."}
{"text":"Ate here again and the wings are just as good as the last time I came here got the Louisiana rub and atomic hot still hot just like I remember it the cheese fries are good maybe my regular meal when I come here next time overall I enjoyed the food and will continue to come back to this location the only negative is the customer service can be a little better but other then that I plan to come back again."}
{"text":"Ok, I hate that the boneless strips are practicaly half the size now days but I still love me some hot flavored hot wings bone in or not doesn't matter. The parmesan wings are good too and I love the sugar fries with cheese for dipping. I wish they would've never stopped doing salads. I was literally there every day for lunch! Love thatthey are open till midnight!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at this location, and after 45 minutes they didn't even start making my order so I got a refund and left.  They weren't that apologetic either. 

There were maybe 5 other families in with me.  After 20 minutes of waiting after I ordered, I saw people who ordered AFTER me were getting their food, so I asked about the status of mine.  I was told they were almost done, and waited a little more.  When I finally got the bag of food it wasn't my food, and not even close to my order!  

So I waited in line another 5 minutes to return the wrong food.  When I finally got to the counter she questioned if I was incorrect about that being the wrong order... Then she told me my food receipt didn't print.  She wasn't apologetic but offered me a refund and said they could start making the food. 

I got a refund, but didn't feel like waiting another 20 minutes for the food and I left.  It was really frustrating and disappointing waiting for 45 minutes and watching other people finish their meals when they ordered after me, and not to get any food when you were looking forward to wings. 

Sadly, I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"Horrible slow service. Lazy , rude workers. Lie about wait times. When I went in one girl at the register, 2 others in the back cleaning. Nobody was making any food and place was filling up with people. I guess the girl at the register was only one attempting to make any food that's if she had 5 min between customers"}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. Food was horrible and service was worse! For what you pay, you might as well go to native or b-dubs for wings! They need a whole new set of staff because clearly everyone thinks it's better to chit chat then do their jobs. So disappointed"}
{"text":"A wing spot that charges too much and has bad quality chicken wings has no place in Pittsburgh. Taking up a good store front for another bar/restaurant in the South side. Avoid the franchise crap."}
{"text":"Horrible service along with terrible attitudes, never have a seen employees willingly stand around and not take orders when's there is a line, I went to ask for a refill since this place is so cheap they don't have self serve and every single one of the employees was sitting down in the back on their phones. 10/10 would not recommend and if I was the owner of this establishment I would clean house and hire and entire new staff."}
{"text":"We love wing stop and eat here at least three to four times a month . Most the times it's awesome and sometimes the fries are soggy but we love the wings !!!"}
{"text":"Nope. You (Wingstop) had one chance to do it right and couldn't.  I ordered the Family Meal (24 pcs) for me and the wife. (We were starving and looking forward to the chow.)  The cashier put everything into a bag, then the bag into a plastic bag. Good thing. The paper bag's bottom was soaked by the time I got home and the plastic bag? It was was leaking.  

The food was overcooked and tough to chew. We'd ordered three sets of 8-piece plain, lemon pepper and garlic Parmesan plus corn and veggies. The food had no taste at all. The plain wasn't even seasoned in any way; just fried in oil. Cardboard tastes better. Of the other two, I found they were just plain wings with flavoring powdered on the outside. Dry as a bone. The corn made up for the lack of seasoning by being WAY over-seasoned.  The dressing was watered down to a thin, soupy consistency.

I'm disappointed beyond belief.  A trip back for a second chance is not in their future."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I think it's average. to be honest. It might be the fact that I am spoiled with Buffalo Wild Wings. but whenever I go to a wing place, i go for garlic parm wings. there wasn't enough garlic butter and too much parmesan. I am a cook at an authentic italian place. and when they brought out the bag of parmesan, i became a harsh critic, that had doubts from the get-go.It seems unfair, but we get our parm in a form of a 50lb wheel, and freshly grate it our self, So i might be a bit spoiled. anyways, the chicken was average, and the sauce was just not that good. the fries were though. For what wing stop is, i think it is average. It's a fast food wing place, that has reasonable prices. This is where I think they succeed. but as far as the actual food goes, it's just ur average wing."}
{"text":"Only 1 star because we waited over 30 minutes (At this moment while I write this review) it's sad when someone from the back has to come out & ask what order I was waiting for..... you can tell the food was sitting for awhile (it was a tad over room temp), but I will say the workers were having a GREAT time laughing with each other!! From now on I'll stick with Jollibee for my chicken needs!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have experienced this year. I call in the order the computers are down the person taking the order doesn't suggest to bring cash only says \"oh I can't give you a total now our system is rebooting I'll have when you arrive.\"   I get there system down I wait 5 mins system still down needless to say I left with no food and no apologies he didn't even care I drove all the way there on my lunch break to eat. I will never order from this company again.  Not only is it important to have great food you should also have great service."}
{"text":"Do you like Hooters for the Wings?? I don't I like it for other reasons!!! 
I like WING STOP for its WINGS!! 
This place has the best wings, original hot is the way to go with some seasoned fries and bleu cheese that will make you feel like a little kid getting their favorite toy in the store."}
{"text":"Great chicken! Fries are great hot, good sauces. Overall, wonderful food and a nice little nook. Never had to wait, orders always accurate and hot! Only downside is the shopping center it is located in is horrid...that and they don't deliver but that close to uncc I can't fault for either."}
{"text":"Not really a big fan of the wings since it doesn't have a lot of meat on it.  But I do like to try out different sauces from the very spicy hot atomic to the sweet teriyaki.  Whatever you like, they have it.  The had the special boneless wings for 60 cents a piece, but no specials for the bone-in wings, not really sure why not.  I especially love their fries, so fresh and not too salty.  This location is right by ASU Tempe Campus and it's near few major freeways, Loop-202, Loop-101, SR-60, and I-10.  Traffic will be a little bit tight during afternoon rush hours.  Overall a great fast service, you should definitely check it out if you are a wing person and have never try it out before.  I would say that it's much much better than Hooter's and Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"The Chicken here is ehhh! Go to Shane's Ribshack a few doors down. The wings are much much much better. Much!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly. There is a wait for your food, but it is to be expected for something that is made when ordered. If this is an issue I would suggest ordering online or calling ahead of time. Wings are not .25 anywhere anymore so it can get a little pricey, but they are tasty and crunchy. French fries and bread rolls are my kids favorite sides."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving wings, but didn't feel like taking the kids out with us, so we ordered online (a huge convenience!). The wings are almost  $1 each, and for that price you'd expect a substantial wing. Not quite. All the wings we were given seemed small, and the picture is one that took the cake. There were 3 wings just like that--1 maybe 1 1/2 bites of chicken. Totally overpriced and not worth it. We won't go back."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of dry-rub chicken wings, but their Louisiana rub is to die for. It has the perfect amount of heat and flavor!
Other than that, all their wings are made fresh and come out hot right away.

The only thing is, I wish their Garlic Parmesan was better. They really don't do justice to my favorite flavor. Their Garlic Parmesan is just regular wings with a slight taste of garlic and covered in shredded Parmesan that you could probably buy at the Wal-mart next door.

Wingstop, Imma let you finish, but B-dubs got the best garlic parmesan sauce ever.

Other than that though, this place is great for lunch and I love coming here when I'm on the way home. Definitely recommend Louisiana rub over any other flavor."}

This is the worst Wingstop I've ever been to and I'm a big Wingstop fan. In my old city we had over 5 wingStops and they were delicious with excellent taste and customer service... But this place is terrible from location to customer service you can barely see the place and once you go in there you will never want to come back.. The employees are scared to work because the owner watches them like a hawk like they're in prison campus it's completely sad.. Normally Wingstop gives you free extra ranch if they forgot to ring it up but they also made me pay for it and swipe my card all over again it was a disaster. I've actually met the owner once he sits in the back corner on his Apple Computer and bosses people around and the complete most ridiculous way possible"}
{"text":"Shocked with the customer service. I'm in from out of town and my friends took me to this place. They told the employee working that they had screwed up their order twice before (forgot an order of cheese). The employee said she would comp an order of cheese ( we ordered with our fries), then we get to the car and realize she left the cheese out! We go back and she says she was sorry but couldn't comp us the cheese... Why didn't she tell us this BEFORE we left??? How deceitful! We asked for the manager who huddled in the background during all this. He finally came up and said he would take care of it. Hope the owners of this place hire new people with customer service skills - my friends are looking to find some other location to give their business to."}
{"text":"Love coming to this location! My fianc√© and I get Wingstop probably 3-4 times a month because we're pretty much addicted and it is way better than Buffalo Wild Wings! The only thing that they need to work on is the consistency of their fries, because I always order my fries extra well done, and there are days that they would be almost burnt and give us the little tiny pieces that you get from the bottom of the fries. But nonetheless, our visits turn out 9/10 positive of the time!"}
{"text":"Ajay and Delia have the best customer service I've ever seen. I showed up 20 minutes before closing and they were eager to take my order , the place was spotless . Even though it took me a while to order because I couldn't decide what flavors they were very patient and I didn't feel rushed. I was having issues with my payment method but they helped resolve it and overall it's the best Wingstop I've been to in town. They know how to handle everything very well. This is definitely my favorite location now!"}
{"text":"I placed an online order, when I arrived they had not even read the order; let alone started to make it. They offered a discount but as we waited, we saw other customers get mad about their lengthy wait times and wrong orders. An employee gave a customer the wrong order and when they realized it, they ran outside to the car to get it from them and hand it to another customer waiting inside! Yuck.. 
When we finally got our order we just checked to make sure we had recorded the correct flavored and you guessed it! We recorded the wrong flavor. Smh! There's 6 people working and only 4 orders being worked on, sad! 
They def need better management. 
Third time here and all experiences were the same. Third time deserved a warning review! Be prepared to wait 30+ minutes for your food and don't be surprised if you get the wrong flavor."}
{"text":"Very good wings, would like a few more sauce options but can't complain. Overall I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Always get less wings and less sauce and find out when I come home. Always.  Don't come here just go to the one on Craig lol save your money that you give them basically for free"}
{"text":"Been coming here since day one and tonight I am highly disappointed. Placed an order over the phone around 9pm and was told it would be ready around 26 minutes...... fast forward it's now 10:30pm no food and still waiting. My only suggestion is more staff. You've got one cook back there slower than a sloth and a poor girl answering the phone, taking walk-ins, anddddd assisting the cook.  I definitely blame upper management for this and not the employees themselves. Currently have 5 people waiting on orders....will mine be next? Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last year after a long day of work at the near-by business.  I ordered a lot of boneless wings with different flavors.  I especially love the garlic sauce, but I didn't talk with anyone after I ate it.  I also love their fries too.  I was sharing the wings with my girl and we spend undisclosed amount of money on our dinner.  Might go back again if I'm craving wings or fries!"}
{"text":"I usually go to BWW but Wingstop is my go to now! Lemon pepper and Hawaiian are my favorite. Wings are a decent size and tasty. Typically 25 minute wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The general manager along with her employee were extremely rude. I will never go to this location again! I will continue to go to 59th and thunderbird!!"}
{"text":"They have some serious timing issues that need to be seriously addressed. It shouldn't take 30 mins for 5 wings and an order of frys.
Won't be back."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Unfortunately they closed the one in henderson so now I have to drive here, and it's not even worth it! Would never recommend it to ANYONE. When I called she said 20 minutes, it's been 37, still not ready!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Postmates for the late night movie at home - the name wasn't revealed at the time, but the Wingstop name was on the tag when delivered.

There's nothing to rave about, but maybe because it's just chicken wings. Heh."}
{"text":"I do usually love this place but man, this time the fries were soggy and wet looking in oil and so were the wings. They also took FOREVER to bring us our food, which considering there were maybe 4 groups of ppl total in the joint, is pretty ridiculous. 

They do have on tap...
 Blue Moon, PBR, Modelo, Newcastle & Bud light
$1 PBR pints, $5 ppitchers!

They have a bunch of bottles too ass well ass wine by the \"glass\". No liquor though.

Almost forgot to mention the coolest feature Wing Stop has to offer...They have one of those soda machines that has over a hundred unique soda flavors. Example, they have vanilla Sprite, peach Sprite, cherry Mello Yello, cherry vanilla Dr Pepp to name a few,

Update:
My brother-in-laws wing finally came out and, although also taking a while, they were way bigger & better cooked. He got the Louisiana rub. Great flavor and good bite.

There's a grip of T.V's too."}
{"text":"The wings are actually pretty good and the price is reasonable. The people on the other hand are the reason I would not go back.  

I tried to place an order on line for pick up. There system wouldn't let me complete the order and pay on line. I thought it may be my card, but after trying two different ones, I realized it wasn't me. I called and placed the order. 

The girl i spoke to was pleasant and really proficient, which was great because I am sure I complicated it.  Then I asked if I could pay over the phone and that's when it got weird. She said no and then there was silence. No explanation as to why...just your order will be ready in about 18th minutes, followed by... the person who is picking it up will have to pay and then she hung up.  Yikes! Did I offend her? Was she that busy? 

I asked my employee, who picked up the order if there were any issues and she told me that the girl at the counter seemed inconvenienced. Oh well at least the order was right."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. So we got a free meal tonight from how bad they messed up our last order. We Order traditional wings and they give us boneless. Seems there is some major issues with commutation and we won't be eating here ever again."}
{"text":"It's all right."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a 2nd chance. First time wasn't very memorable. Ordered wings, got a bag of oil instead. Damaged my vehicle interior. Price for 25 wings comes out to roughly $23, expensive compared to most places that serve wings."}
{"text":"Good food and good service every time we have gone. And even when our online order went through on our end but didn't get sent to them, they looked up the order number, had it filled ASAP and even gave us a few extras for our time and their system mess up."}
{"text":"A friend kept raving about wingstop so I had to stop at wingstop to see for myself. Originally a BWW fan, to be honesty I was a bit skeptical. I was presently surprised. The restaurant was clean, very inviting and the food was just as on par with BWW, except the fries at wingstop were a step above. The only thing that kept it from a five-star was the pricing. For a take-out/dine in spot, I was surprised at how expensive it was. Anyways, get the 12 wing combo and split it with someone. It's plenty of food that will cost you about $8 + tax per person. The food was tasty and I will definitely be back. Only wish they had one in the southwest area of Vegas valley."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate a friend's bday because this is his favorite kind of food. We all order the 8 pcs combo that included fries, 1 sauce, and drink for about $10. Monday I believe is 60-cent boneless wings so I tried some. NOT a fan of boneless wings and these truly confirmed it. Mostly breading and dry inside. I would have given it a 5-star if it wasn't for the boneless wing experience. Anyways, if you love wings, this is a great alternative to BWW or others. Oh, and don't forget to try the garlic parmesan cheese fries. But expect your breath to have an odor."}
{"text":"This location is huge compared to other wingstops! My wings and fries were prepared to order no complaints. Staff was friendly. There was no wait when I arrived and my order took about 15 minutes to prepare. I will be back"}
{"text":"Why did I bother coming back here against my better judgement? I don't know. I ordered 2 separate meals and they decide to give one batch of fries but claim \"we combined and put the fries together into one\". No. I didn't pay $25 for 2 eight pieces of wings, 2 drinks, and 1 little batch of fries. I bought two separate meals which means 2 separate fries. Did not ask anyone to \"combine\" anything. Which by the way was actually a half a small paper plate of fries. I'm irritated for having spent that much money on a meal that left us hungry. The cook in the back was very high also and customer service was non-existent."}
{"text":"Wings are good but no better than Buffalo Wild Wings.  The fries are average, to-go ordering is slow, and the only flavor sauce I really liked was the Teriyaki and they took it away. The Korean BBQ is pretty good though. 

Oh, and the online ordering is terrible. I know that's not this location's fault, but it's 1001 steps to order and you'll still miss the final \"place your order\" step if you're not careful."}
{"text":"The best Wings ever. I'm so glad that Henderson NV has a Wing stop now. Great service fresh and clean. Very friendly folks, great smiles."}
{"text":"Wingstop with a bar! . What more can you ask for?!
Only in Viva las VegasFamily deal comes with mozzarella sticks and a pitcher of draft beer. Wings were delicious. The wait time could be faster but, everything is cooked fresh per order. I recommend the lemon-pepper."}
{"text":"Are you kidding? This place has the worst customer service of any restaurant I've had an opportunity to choose in the last six months!  They have absolutely no personality whatsoever, no clue about customer service.  I would never come to this one as long as the current management is available. Now, to be fair, Wingstops in Tucson are actually exceptional. The people down there know what customer service is all about. Thank you..."}
{"text":"After ordering two 10 piece wings with no sides  i was more than amazed that these did not come with dipping sauce. well sauce was there for a price  extra no thanks i already paid enough ill never come back  thats like salad with no dressing"}
{"text":"I frequently visit this location and the service and quality of the food is outstanding. I usually order my food before I go in so the wait is not so long. The staff and managment are always friendly and extremely professional. I highly recommend this Wingstop to anyone looking for fast quality food and a great place to dine in."}
{"text":"Order some wings to go.. When I got home they were all drums! Thumbs down for the kitchen staff gosh! Who wouldn't be pissed off if all they got was drums.."}
{"text":"Wing Stop is great. They have a lot of flavors to choose from. They sell chicken wings, chicken strips, fries, and veggies. Their chicken wings and strips are currently available in 11 different flavors. The menu board has them listed in order of spiciness, which is very helpful. My favorite is the teriyaki bone-in wings. They have lots of flavor and a dipping sauce is not necessary. They are finger-licking good on their own. I'm not into spicy at all, but if you are into the obnoxious kind of spicy, my friends have recommended the atomic wings. They are at the top of the spiciness scale, so have something handy to cool your mouth down with. I also love the fries here. They are soft and perfect for dipping if you get them plain. You can also get them loaded with a nacho cheese sauce and jalape√±os. 

This particular location has never let me down when it comes to customer service. The staff is always happy and friendly. Never seen a frown on an employee here. Only downside is that this location is a little small, so it's hard to find a place to sit if you want to eat in."}
{"text":"Terrible workers around 7pm every night. They are slow and don't make the food efficiently. I have yet to out an online order and have it ready at stated time. Really disappointing as the food is good at other locations. Just this location gives the wing stop name a bad reputation. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Wings were good, ordered on line hoping to save some time.  However that didn't happen, arrived 15 minutes after placing  my order.  Two people in front of me, and I payed for my order.   Four people behind me got theirs before mine showed up.  I stood off to the side waiting.  After the forth person I walked up and asked \"oh here it is\".  Very pleasant people. But that was a fail on service.  No napkins in bag? 7pm"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great. Liked that they informed me that it would be a 15-20 minute wait. The wings are cooked fresh and all food was hot.  If you want your food right away you can call ahead to order. Just a few suggestions....add a trash in the seating area so people can throw away garbage and get some wet wipes so that upon request they can be given out."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but the reason for the 2 stars is because although the food was terrible, the staff was friendly. I ordered the mild buffalo wings and my boyfriend ordered the BBQ wings, we both were not satisfied as how they tasted. As my first time being here and having a bad experience, I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars just based on food. Service needs some help. And the wait is outrageous. But tired of people turning down good food based off of Ratings on Yelp. My advice, order ahead because it's not the place if you're in a hurry. But food is made to order and fresh. Very tasty."}
{"text":"We ordered online told us it would take about 18 minutes. Got to the place and waited another 10. There were 3-4 tables dining in and they haven't gotten their orders either. The service was overall on the slow side - only two people were on shift.

The wings themselves are alright - ordered the lemon pepper, mango habanero, and Cajun. Mango habanero isn't as spicy as I've tasted at other location. Lemon pepper was greasy. My favorite are the fries but they were a bit soggy."}
{"text":"I call in early so I can eat quick.. because I'm hungry.. and I need to get out quick. I get in, pay. Then I sit reading for 30-45 minutes and finally realize it's been way too long and ask what the deal is. The terd who took my order was apparently completely out of it and was twiddling his thumbs while my order he took sat right next to him. All of the times I've been there it seems to take quite a bit longer than expected. 
There wings are great but this really annoyed me. They get a one star for now."}
{"text":"Moving from a city that you have lived in for a long time can be difficult, there is the excitement of what you may find in the city that you are moving too but there is the realization that just maybe, where you live now is as good as it gets.

When I left Las Vegas for Salt Lake City I had no idea that I was gong to miss my favorite wing joint as much as I do. Hey there must be a wing joint in Salt Lake that measures up to Wing Stop right ..................... oh, no not really!!!

Every time I make it back to Vegas getting over to Wing Stop to see all of my old friends and to partake in the best wings EVER is always on my to do list.

Everything at Wing Stop is melt in your mouth awesome, the wings are cooked to perfection, the fries are greasy goodness, and they have the best rolls that are second only to my mom's thanksgiving day rolls.

I simply cannot get enough of this place, I need a Wing Stop in Salt Lake or I need to make more trips to Las Vegas.

If you stop in tell Sharon the manager that Kish says hello, she will know who you are talking about, trust me.

Go to Wing Stop, enjoy the food, enjoy the great wing joint atmosphere, and thank me for the tip later.

Until next time fellow Yelpers ............... Be Local, Live Local, Buy Local!!!"}
{"text":"I'm very impressed with this WingStop. My family had never been to one before, so they needed a bit of understanding on how the place worked (how many flavors you can get based on how many wings you order, etc). The staff took plenty of time explaining it all professionally.

So we ordered. We ordered the 40 wing family pack with 4 sets of different flavoring. About 15 minutes later, we got called up for our order. Turns out, someone else had taken our order by accident. They showed their remorse for their mistake and quickly fixed the issue in about 10 minutes. And it was worth the 25 minute wait !!

The Parmesan flavor is amazing. The original flavoring is pretty good too. The Honey BBQ was very delicious (my favorite). The Hawaiian flavor was fantastic too (sweeter sauce).

Even with the little error, I'd have gladly waited double that time for these wings. They were that good. If you're a wing lover, you must check this place out !!"}
{"text":"So I'll start with something nice..the wings are good. Damn good. Especially the Louisiana Rub. Like finger licking, gimme more...please...GOOD. 

But the customer service is seriously lacking. I've visited this location on more than one occasion and the service has been consistently bad.Now, I don't expect them to knock it out the park every single time....it's a fast food joint. But I do expect for them to at least acknowledge their customers request and not give them attitude back when they present an issue. I mean is it just me or shouldn't you be able to get good service and good food at the same damn time?!

What saves this place is that the food is good. The service, however needs a serious overhaul."}
{"text":"So I'm here for the first time. I've never been to wing stop. I've only tried a wing from a friend before and thought it was gross, but that was over 3 years ago. So I'm hoping it's delicious this time. 
I ordered the family pack. Comes with 24 wings, 3 flavors, 3 dips, large fries, and veggie sticks. It cost $23.99 for boneless and $28.49 for bone -in. 
The inside is spacious and clean. Customer service was as expected. Food was made to order as stated on their sign."}
{"text":"Placed an order online ahead of time, it wasn't ready when I arrived. Also, when I got home he wings were lacking sauce and we were also missing a side of fries."}
{"text":"EPIC FAIL!

Wow, what a complete disappointment! HORRIBLE service!

We (2 of us) went in a little after noon on a Sunday for lunch. It was my first time trying a Wing Stop and I was super disappointed. The store hours say they open at 11am, but when we walked in after noon they were still setting things up and took several minutes to come to the counter to greet us. They were nice enough, but it took over 20 minutes to get our food.

Over 20 minutes for hot wings is ridiculous. Then to add insult to injury one of the two orders of fries was so over salted it was inedible. They replaced the fries without any hassle, but all the fries were not cooked the same. They were cut all oddball with some skinny and some thick, so some were overcooked and some undercooked.

The wings were decent, but nothing impressive. I have had better at several other wing places. There are too many places that make good wings and have good service to ever go here again.

I have a hunch the reason for the bad service was no management. I didn't see any manager in the store. Everyone looked college age and while it is certainly possible a college age person could be a manager, nobody in that store acted like one. 

Steer clear if you want good food with good service."}
{"text":"Wingstop over BDubbs. Soooooo good. The garlic Parmesan flavor is actual Parmesan, with garlic. Idk any other place that does that. The fried corn. Omg!!!! The fried corn is freaking amazing. My absolute favorite though is mild well done. My mouth is watering. Going to wingstop now."}
{"text":"Always on point, always friendly. Staff has an actual sense of urgency. Love this location."}
{"text":"The food was great and fresh, the only downfall is that if  you're extremely hungry, it takes a while for the food to come out. Overall, customer service was great :)"}
{"text":"The food is gross. The fries and wings were full of grease. I couldn't take another bite and had to throw the whole family meal out."}
{"text":"Good food, but you really do not 'save time by ordering online now!'. I placed an order over half an hour ago, expecting my order to be available when I walked in. Instead, I'm currently stuck sitting on the wooden bench inside their restaurant, waiting at least an extra 20 mins because they haven't bothered started making my order. I wasn't offered an apology, discount, or any sort of compensation. And yet, the staff has time to mingle and take a photo with the Red Bull girls that just walked in.

In fact, it looks like they have an entire stack of papers next to their register that haven't been tended to. I guess I can kill time by leaving a review. I wonder how many more hungry peoples' dinners are getting delayed tonight.

Garlic Parmesan flavor on classic wings are the best. Way too salty on the chicken strips. You also can't go wrong with the original hot flavor. Get the cheese dip on the side so you have the option of dipping instead of turning your fries soggy."}
{"text":"We got wings to go from this location. The wings were not fully cooked. Rubbery skin, not crispy at all, even with a dry rub. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"How do you know when a place is good? When they can own up to human error and make it right. Thank you to Tom the general manager who made the order himself to ensure it was right. Starry night is a wonderful picture Tom and thank you for making sure I got my lemon pepper all flats order."}
{"text":"I love this Wingstop, but they need to answer there phone, they are the closest to Avondale & Goodyear. I got here and they had no one in line. They just decided not to answer the phone. Its bad customer service, PLEASE ANSWER THE DANM PHONE, we people want to eat..."}
{"text":"the price is reasonble price. the chicken wings is pretty big. we all love it. it is the best chicken wing in town."}
{"text":"I have to say that the customer service is OUT OF THIS WORLD here!! There were two younger ladies working behind the counter and they were so nice and welcoming. It was my husband and I's first time and they recommended things and helped us out!  I can't tell you how much I appreciate service that actually appears to be enjoying their job. Very clean and cute decor too! 

It lost a star only because they aren't the BEST wings I've ever had, but they are pretty darn close!! We got a 10pc strip meal with a large fry and two drinks. Then we had to add on the yeast rolls too (they looked so good).  WAY too much food for the two of us, but delicious all the same!! I got mild, but my husband said their hot is hot!!

Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This Wingstop is top notch. I love the lemon pepper wings well done, so savory and crispy! Be sure and call ahead that way everything is ready for you to take home and devour!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings.  Area is little shady but worth the trip if you love wings."}
{"text":"We got 20 wings here recently and they were literally the worst wings I have ever had.

They were small, soggy, had a gray tint and were generally unappetizing. We're poor students, so I ate them anyways, and thanked my lucky stars when I wasn't up puking all night. That is the best thing I can say- that they didn't give me food poisoning. 

They were small, like, a bite of chicken on each wing, weren't crispy at all and the flavors were bland and tasted a bit off, like gone bad off. 

As an employee/business owner, I would have been so  embarrassed to sell these things. They were priced the same as Buffalo Wild Wings, whose wings are big and crispy at least. I will never, ever, eat here again and I caution anyone else to avoid them as well. Eating here is a terrible waste of money."}
{"text":"Wings were awesome(probably better than BDUBS), fries not so much, but I think that was fine.
Overall good food."}
{"text":"The WORST place to eat ever! Their customer service is HORRIBLE. They take forever because they're too busy talking to each other in the corner. Waited 45 minutes for my food. The manager on duty was eating Hershey kisses, and hosting a meeting right in the front of customers. Very unsanitary especially in the food workplace!!! So unprofessional and crap service. Also called the Better Business Bureau on this company. Horrible and terrible place ever.  Never coming back again."}
{"text":"My family loves the wings from wing stop. The only location that we have eaten from is the one in Bloomington.  On our way back home from a weekend trip to Carbondale,  we decided to place an order using the mobile app to the Wing Stop in Champaign.  Big mistake. I arrived 5 minutes after the time that my order was supposed to be ready only to be told that it would be another 30 minutes. 45 minutes later the employee that originally told me 30 minutes looks at me in shock and asks my name again.  About ten minutes later, my order was ready. After another hour drive to get home, I find out that the potato salad that I ordered and was correct on my receipt was coleslaw. The food from this chain is good , but this location has horrible service and should not take more orders than they can handle at a given time. Also, if you are going to take orders when you are in over your heads, have the common sense to fill them in the order taken. I saw quite a few people come in, place their order and receive it before me."}
{"text":"I had a problem with my take out order, I called and spoke to the manager and she gave me no trouble she just took care of the problem NO ANDs, IFs or BUTs --GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE !!! & the food was GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"What a crappy experience...

I've eaten from here on several occasions but never at this location so this was my first & last physical visit.

About the food - it's not bad. I've only had the boneless wings & a variety of the sauces which have been good. The fries & veggies are decent as well and with that said this isn't one of my regular go to's. 

Here's the reason for my one star review - 
Walking in I immediately noticed how filthy this place was. There was trash on the tables, as well as the counter. That worried me because that's always a bad sign. Next came our ordering process which wasn't the greatest as the girl at the counter was having a bad day and wasn't the friendliest. We repeated our order several times as she seemed to be having issues with the system they use. Afterwards we walked away after she told us it would be approx 15-20 minutes. This seemed odd to me because nobody takes this long. 

We sat around for about half an hour & I finally went up to inquire about our food to be told the order didn't make it into the system. She wasn't apologetic or nice about it either. She then told me everything would be out in about 5 mins. 10 mins later I went back up & asked for our money back. She was really annoyed by this & took her time doing whatever they need to do. No apology, no care in the world & after wasting about 45 mins we walked out. 
 
Everyone can have a bad day, we all do. But when you're in customer service you can't treat the people who pay your bills like crap. My wing cravings will go to Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"This place always makes me wait forever for my orders.  I'm not sure why I come back and may just give up on Wing Stop.  The food is always good although their prices are pretty high for what you get.  They do have a pretty decent special on Mon-Tue of you like boneless wings. The people working the counter are friendly and the place is pretty clean."}
{"text":"Horrible service wait it for my food for an hour.  Will not come here again. The food was ok. But horrible visit overall."}
{"text":"Hands down, favorite wings. So crispy and flavorful, never soggy and drenched in sauce like other places. And they are always served piping hot just the way I like it. 

This location is inside Santa Fe Casino so my kids and I usually eat here after the movies or bowling. 

I rarely order anything but Lemon Pepper & Garlic Parmesan (bone-in) but the other flavors are worth a try too. Would be nice to have the soda machine like other locations do where you can customize your drink. But I am glad the sodas are self serve now. Easier to get refills without waiting too long. They are usually busy. Which reminds me, the wings here take a while to cook so be patient, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I recently came in for an interview the lady was late and none of the employees spoke to me or several others that were there for an interview at the same time. 
A young lady that was working in the back did not have on gloves and she sneezed and whipped her nose with her hands.
 I will not eorking or eating at this location."}
{"text":"I ordered wings online from Wing Stop.  I went to the restaurant to pick them up 5 minutes before they were supposed to be ready.  I showed the cashier my credit card and ID and signed the paper.  I sat down in the restaurant to wait for my wings.  20 minutes later my wing order still hadn't been called so I went to the counter to see what was going on.  Not only were my wings not ready, they hadn't been started and no one knew about the order.  They couldn't find the order and instead of figuring out what was wrong with my order the cashier started helping other customers.   
The wings are good but the service is not.  I won't return with so many other options in south side that are as good or better, with much better service."}
{"text":"This wing stop is amazing. Every person on the staff is friendly and helpful. I always order online so that by the time I get there, I don't have to wait for my food. My order is always correct and fresh. The cashier always makes sure everything is included in my order to avoid any problems. Great food! Awesome staff! Amazing experience."}
{"text":"Going downhill quick. The last few times we've ordered, fries have been undercooked, items forgotten, under seasoned fries. I hope they get it together! Our kid loves it and it's one of the few take out places we get."}
{"text":"I have ordered twice from here online and always fast and ready when I go pick up my order. People and service is great I always order the classic wings with lemon pepper flavored and teriyaki flavored. The rolls are good but the first time I ordered it was too buttery but other than its awesome food!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a small location, but the service is awesome and the food is delicious. The employees are really friendly as well."}
{"text":"Normal place is Buffalo Wild. Order online and it's NEVER ready when quoted. 
Ordered online here, first time, and was VERY happy with the service, speed and quality. Got everything extra crispy which was awesome. 

This is now my normal place for wings!"}
{"text":"The best wings! I'm drooling for more while typing this. Employees were nice. The ranch cups are huge. Plan ahead because they make the wings as you order them so there might be a wait. Was told my order would be ready in 25 minutes but we waited 40."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with the wings. They were hard and dry. The fries were good but so what. For having a name like Wingstop the wings should have been amazing."}
{"text":"Erratic service.  Cramped space.  Gave it another shot after ralphin after gettin a pick-up order.  Still gross... Hope I can keep it down"}
{"text":"The food is amazing I eat there everyday for my lunch break!and they have 50cent boneless wings Monday and Tuesday!but my most favorite thing is the hit fresh buttery rolls."}
{"text":"The cashier was rude to us and we overlooked it. Then we got THESE. THESE AS FRIES. THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST TINY CRISPS. Still gonna go back because I love Wingstop but really...why. We tried eating it and just overlooking it BUT LOOK AT THEM."}
{"text":"I love wing stop I have an addiction but don't dine in. Get your food to go sometimes the staff is friendly seems like they are in a rush to get you out of there. When I ordered the girl with long hair rushed me and cut me off a whole lot when I tried to talk. That's definitely not so friendly especially if this place pays you 10$ an hr you might as well pay for some good service employees and who aren't on their phone."}
{"text":"the order took way too long to prepare if you come for lunch during work. The drink machine in the back is kind of an inconvenience and it slows down the line having the workers do it. Something was a little off with the wings here opposed to the other WS."}
{"text":"This Wing Stop is huge and conveniently located near UNLV and their wing special on the Tuesday that we went was awesome and totally worth every dollar. They have lots of large TVs for sports viewing needs  

We came in a big group and they were able to accommodate us surprisingly well. We ordered 3 of the 24piece wing specials that comes with 1pitcher of beer, mozzarella sticks, carrots and celery. And on all 3 orders of the 24piece wings we were able to get different sauces for each set of orders. They made the ordering process easy and it didn't take too long for the food to come out  despite it was a busy sports night during the  basketball playoffs and we were a large group. 

Get 4 stars coz even though it's way bigger than most wing stops... Place still feel really packed and crammed... But that's expected from a sports bar."}
{"text":"Ordered wings 20 traditional wings, was told it would be 45 min wait! Ended up being over an hour, tried calling the store to be hung up on twice and then no answer.  Then when the driver arrived they were lost.... this isn't the first time I've had wings delivered! Horrible service... and on top of all that, the wings were soo small that all 20 fit in one regular sized container! When ordering,no one not even the manager told us of the decreased size of the wings!"}
{"text":"Food was great but the cashiers really need some training in customer service. We had ordered online and was accidentally sent to the store on Nellis and the cashier told us where it was and acted like we should waste our time and drive over there we pretty much had to ask her to help us. She was very short and unfriendly with us. Definitely not a person that should be working face to face with the public"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with a group of friends and I've got to say they have some if the best wings I've ever had in my life! So good! And the fries are delishh!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for the last couple years. Everything's always been good except one day my sliders were undercooked and I would've went back to complain but was too lazy. 

Since then we have went back and everything has been a'okay.

By the way, they don't serve sliders anymore and have new chicken strips that are great and cheaper than anything else on the menu!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Wing Stop restaurant. The wait to order was not long at all and my food came out in a reasonable time considering the fact that the restaurant was extremely busy. My food was made just as I had ordered. I like the fact that it was piping hot when I sat down to eat it. The dining room was clean for the most part. The only downsides that I have to mention is the fact that the they don't put napkins in the tables and everyone is forced to get their napkins from this one large roll of paper towels that is on the condiment station.  From a food and health safety standpoint, I take extreme issue to that. Everyone's hands have been all over the paper towel roll before me. Also, the men's bathroom was disgusting. The toilet had not been flushed and the flor was littered with toilet paper and paper towel debris. The bathroom sink had hair all over it and there was not any paper towels in the automated dispenser (the red light was blinking which should have clearly indicated to an employee that the dispenser was out of paper towels, if they were checking the bathrooms regularly). I dined in and was in the restaurant about 2 hours, and not one time did I see an employee go to check those bathrooms out. 

The food quality is what has assured that this is a 3 star review, because they certainly don't make the grade on cleanliness."}
{"text":"Everything is great about Wingstop. The food is excellent, but the only thing that they slack on is that I feel like they are under staffed. It's always a really long wait and there's is always a long line and only one cashier everytime I've come here. They need more up front and in the back as well!"}
{"text":"I love this new location. I've been here twice in the last week! The staff here is awesome! We were welcomed right when we walked in, by 10 employees at once! Quite a unique experience :D Now I'm happy and ready to eat. I tend to stick with the original hot, but all the wing flavors here are great. Bring your family, because there's lots of seating. I've already brought my brother and girlfriend here :) This location is clean and professional. I will be coming back again soon. You can bet on that!!! If you get fries, try them with the nacho cheese. It's to die for!!! Food here is worth the wait, because it's always so hot and fresh..."}
{"text":"The Original Hot wings here are primo! I come here at least once a month. The Fries here are awesome n' if you like Nacho Cheese, dip em' in. Nom nom nom! Soda machine here is legit too. So many flavors n' options!!!"}
{"text":"Three stars for being average. Nothing worth wowing over. Fries were too soggy & salty. Wings didn't come with the wow factor I was anticipating for."}
{"text":"Best wings in Tempe. The Louisana rub flavor is spicy and flavorful. $2.75 bud lights. I'd rather go here for a quick meal and a beer than Buffalo Wild Wings any day. Great and friendly service, it's a no brainer."}
{"text":"I love these wings!!! I wanna go back and get some more. I recommend the Cajun wings or the garlic Parmesan because the flavors are just spicy and soooo addicting. Definitely coming back for sure. Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"I've counted 5 people working the kitchen yet there is still a 25+ minute wait. The restaurant isn't even half full.  Bad management."}
{"text":"I just want to give a special shout out to this location especially the employee, I believe her name was Jamilett. My family and I went to Buffalo Wild Wings to eat on a Sunday night. BWW was packed so we decided to go to this Wingstop. When we arrived, the employee noticed right away it was a big family so she and another employee quickly put together a couple tables and chairs for us. Then when it came time to order, we took our time and there was a lot of confusion between our family (again, big family). At no time did I feel pressure from Jamilett. She was very patient and made some great suggestions as well. We finally put the order in and a couple of my family members had never tried Wingstop. They loved the wings. Especially their Hawaiian and Mango Habanero. Definitely recommend this location to anyone around the Henderson area!"}
{"text":"Great taste. But don't do a carryout without double checking what you get. More than once my order has been wrong & I had to go back."}
{"text":"So let me put this out there first. . .I am really not a wing person. . .but the bf was craving some wings so we ended up here.  =)

Service was a little lack luster.  The girl was prompt in asking for my name but no smile no nothing. . .it was just business as usual. . .I feel like it would have just been a notch better if she had smiled even if it was fake. . .u know what I am saying? (-1 star)

Soda Machine. . .yes I LOVE this machine!  So many flavor combos!  This is the weird little machine that has I think like over 100 drink combinations. . .and my fav. . .diet dr pepper with cherry.  =D  This was the only bright spot to my meal. . .so +1 for the machine.  =)

I ordered the atomic chicken tenders. . .and they had a little kick BUT the rest of the flavor was all vinegar!  I could taste the spice but it was so tangy that it just was not good.  And they did not have any chicken tenders so they had to fry them up for the order.  So we waited a good 20 minutes for the chicken tenders and they were sadly very soggy.  I know that it is tossed in a sauce. . .but the parts of the tender that was not covered was soggy. . .in other words, I had soggy breaded chicken tenders with vinegary sauce on it. . .not yummy in my book at all!!  =(  (-1 star for the soggy tenders, -1 for the wait)

Fries were ok. . .they were kind of on the dark side but there were bits and pieces that were crisp. . .but. . .the majority were soggy. . .I think I am getting a trend here. . .(-1 star for soggy fries)

Ambiance. . .it was dirty. . .it looked like no one had cleaned up in a while and seeing as how it was pretty empty when we walked in. . .kind of sad. . .(-1 star for being semi dirty when it was empty)

Overall, I will not be going back. . .when the bf is craving wings again. . .we will be going to Buffalo Wild Wings. . ."}
{"text":"When we have a craving for some yummy chicken wings...WING STOP! I like the fact that this place is not OVERLY sports oriented like Buffalo Wild Wings. I can skip the douche bags yelling over me as I try and enjoy a meal. Most of the patrons are just regular people trying to fill their bellies with wings. 

My usual is the boneless garlic and parmesan. They get it just right every time. The fries that come with are so great with the skin on! Thank god they taste like actual potatoes! lol! I hate \"fake\" fries that taste like they've been frozen since the last ice age! lol! The bf has tried atomic wings only once. I think that is enough for his life time. I think he just wanted his name up on the board. He is a huge fan of hot and spicy foods, while I am just a spectator. This definitely made him sweat! He turned from a white boy to a red man! Thankfully there is a new soda machine that allowed him to quench his thirst in a multitude of Coke product flavors."}
{"text":"This is my #1 craving spot. The wings are delicious & fries are always great! I had an issue one time with my order & the manager, (a lady with blonde hair) was very nice & apologetic.  Redid my order & even added extra food which is always a big PLUS. Everytime I go its very clean & the staff are all friendly. Love this place & will continue to come here for late night cravings!"}
{"text":"Picked up some food for my fianc√© 
I'm not a big fan of wings.
I received great prompt service and the girl helped me pick the order! Which was rady within 12 min

My fianc√© loved the food. Will def go back and I do recommend the place!!!"}
{"text":"This location has horrible customer service. I work in the parking lot with the Wing stop and have ordered wings about 5 times from them and each time they have a really bad attitude when I am paying. The cashier today threw the receipt at me and then gave me a bad look.I rather drive down to the location on Spring Mountain for better customer service and spring mtn's prices are less then this location. Bad service and higher prices."}
{"text":"Awesome service, always friendly staff members. I typically order online and pick up and then eat there. Food is always ready right after I arrive. I have tried some other locations throughout the valley and they do not give the same type of customer service as the spring mountain location does. Great job and its to bad the other locations don't have great staff members."}
{"text":"Two stars for service. We live on UH and enjoy the taste and quality of WS. At one point we were ordering every other weekend. Unfortunately the last 4-5 times that we've attempted to order we were placed on hold for over 5 minutes or they just never answered. I would estimate that our average order is about $25-$30. Granted we usually order on Friday or Saturday but that is NO excuse. We're close to throwing the towel in....the owner needs to see this and improve his/her operation ASAP."}
{"text":"Me and my co-workers always get the best service.  They have no problem with us faxing in an order and the food is ready when we arrive.  The food is excellent.  I love the cripsy texture of the wings, and the boneless strips are GREAT also.  On one of our visits, they gave us a ton of free food to sample all the new items on the menu.  I highly recommend this place.  BTW, the RANCH is the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta say these are the best wings ever, the lemon pepper are our favorite. They seem to have raised the prices our check was a bit heavy for what we ordered, but you get what you pay for and these ate killer wings."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience there, and I didn't even dine in. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, the place was very clean and there was an overall good vibe. The supervisor was very patient even when I was a little indecisive on my order, and was even nice enough to let my friend try the potato salad before ordering, which was really generous. Lastly the food was really good, I ordered bone out lemon pepper and original hot and it was, hot, fresh and delicious as well as the fries. I was also excited to try the 100+ flavor beverage machine since I hardly see them in fast good restaurants. Overall I'd recommend anyone to eat here or take it to go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the variety of wings there. You can get your wings with the bone in and you can get your wings boneless. You can also get free drinks as long as you eat in the restaurant. I will always come here for my wings!"}
{"text":"I have no idea where to begin with this one. Service is overall bad. Walked in to maybe 20-30 ppl waiting for food. Order after order had to be check for accuracy, making the wait even longer. Fountain machines were out of order but that was the least of the problems. The restaurant didn't look under staffed but it felt like It was. Clearly pointing towards a problem with the operations and processes that would make them efficient. The menu isn't grand, it's wings and fries. Even if every order is made fresh, that shouldn't be a problem. There were individuals who had waited an additional 45 mins after call ahead/ online ordering. The staff seemed overwhelmed with orders. However i think you can blame that on the operations and processes used at this location. Highly unlikely I would recommend anyone to return to this location."}
{"text":"Finally a Wing Stop on this side of town!!! Lets give them our business and keep it open. I have gotten the word out and hope they have a successful business because I cant keep driving 30 minutes for lemon pepper wings!"}
{"text":"I called several times and was hung up on, then it gave me a busy tone. Finally I got thru and who ever (female) answered the phone was not friendly at all. I even said thank you after placing the order and I couldn't even get a \"you welcome\" I was just hung up on. This is my first time calling or placing an order at this location. I decided not to even bother coming in."}
{"text":"This is our first time here. The friendly staff at the front ( Andrea and Lakeitha) greeted us as soon as we walked through the door. They explained their special they were running as well as menu options. Our food came out quickly and was delicious. I definitely recommend if you are a wing lover!"}
{"text":"I already love Wingstop, it's my favorite of the major wing places around.  This one however is extra special, it's a new Wingstop Sports.  Its basically like a sports bar similar to Buffalo Wild Wings.  This Wingstop has much larger space for seating, has a wider variety of food selections including burgers, appetizers etc.  The manager is also a really cool fun guy who has always been nice to my friends and I.  We used to know this guy when he was working at a different Wingstop in the Vegas area.  I don't know if it was luck, but my wings were larger than I think I have ever had from a Wingstop before and they are always good size anyways.  Tried the new Mango Habanero and those were delicious along with Cajun.  They also have the best ranch of any place period.  The place was in a busy area, kept very clean inside, and they have those new soda machines with like 1,000 flavor options so that was nice too.  For those into drinking they do serve alcohol as well.  Food was delicious, service was great.  We ordered online and it was all ready when we got there and still fresh and hot.  Very happy and will be bringing my family back with me the next time."}
{"text":"The Spring Mountain location..Ordered the Garlic Parmesan wings, seasoned fries and the Bourbon Baked Beans..it took 20mins to make d wings..Came back 20mins later to pkup my order, got home n found over cooked dried out wing coated a ton w/just Parmesan cheese, no garlic at all..horrible. The seasoned fries were wilted regular fries..- a mistake or those were their seasoned fries which were no favor at all fries  - horrible.. The only thing good was d Bourbon Baked beans..I will never ever order or eat anything from this place. I was so hoping that d wings they supply Pizza hut The Garlic Parmesan  wings wld b d same but.. sadly it was not..instead it was d worst tasteless wings n fries I've ever eaten..don't bother w/dis place"}
{"text":"This is an aggravating review to write, only because the food was actually really good. It's the crew and service that hinder this location. Every time I order wings here I have to wait 10-15 mins longer than the time I'm quoted. When I get there, the crew is unfriendly and seem completely unmotivated. I've heard crew members cussing, cutting up, and talking with friends that hang out in the seating area there. I can never tell who the actual manager is or who's in charge. 

The owner needs to take a hard look at the crew and management at this location."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience from start to finish. Josie was amazing. By far the best experience at wingstop. I recommend this destination to everyone in the vegas area ."}
{"text":"Wingstop is fast food so I don't expect a five star meal.

The food here isn't great, but it also isn't expensive.

You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place.  The wings are delicious, and aren't too pricey.  The staff are always nice, and the wings always take only 14 minutes i think it was to make.  It's never busy in there, you're always in an out with no problems or worries =]  Love this place, and I drive from 23rd ave and the 101 to this location just for their wings.  Yes it is that good =]  Lemon Pepper is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Placed an order online couple hours ahead of time. Arrived at pick up time. The guy found out the my order was faxed in and placed under the cashier. So I have to wait another 30 mins before getting my food. Good service but they are heavily under staff. And the online ordering system is a joke."}
{"text":"This is my spot for wings!! Every time I'm Vegas this is my first stop to have lunch before checking into my hotel. Anyone who is a fan of Wing Stop knows and understands the dine-in area is small it is primary a takeout restaurant, but the area is nice and clean. Also it is very cheap!!"}
{"text":"place was ok, staff was great but food was just ok, like a fastfood kinda experience."}
{"text":"Food is good, this was my first time at any wing stop and honestly the man attending me was really rude. I was asking about flavor of wings and he said \"well normally people don't know how to order and I have to explain to them\" with an attitude to last a whole teens life. I almost walked out because I didn't have time for rudeness. Another employee noticed his attitude and jumped in front of him and asked me if I wanted to test the various flavors. Apparently the first guy with the huge attitude is the manager.  Enough for me not to be back. The sad thing is that I work at the school across the street from this location. Bummer, I love the wings though but after a long day with over 26 children the least thing I want to deal with  is a stinky attitude."}
{"text":"I am unsatisfied with the service here. It literary took several minutes to get a to go box. How does that even happen when you're standing in front of them waiting for the boxes that you have been asking for more than just once, while they are in the back while you're watching them and they are just talking! This is unacceptable! Other then that food was okay."}
{"text":"Wings are good but the customer service is very poor.  They seem to always be understaffed. 
Have had numerous problems ordering over the phone for take out."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this location ZERO stars. The health department needs to investigate this establishment! My husband and I ordered wings for delivery. We ordered 2 orders of 6 pieces of the Spicy Korean Q. Everything came as ordered with the exception of us paying for a large drink and only receiving a small one - this was no big deal to us. As my husband was eating his wing he plucked out little feathers from his wing. He did not wish to continue eating his wings and I don't blame him. Right after he discovered his feather I noticed something in my throat and managed to cough up a PIECE of a feather as well and could only imagine how many feathers did we actually consume. When I went to call this location back to report this incident the so called supervisor was not sincere in her apology and did not assure me that any sort of investigation will take place in order to make sure this doesn't happen to any other customers that choose to dine there today. She said the cook \"typically\" checks the chicken before throwing them in the fire. This is so disgusting. I will no longer put any money into this business."}
{"text":"It's wings done extremely well and with great customer service. The staff are super friendly and always check up on us. The wait time varies though. I had an order take about 20 minutes which is pushing it. But still, it was worth the wait!

I recommend the mango habanero and lemon pepper with cheese fries!"}
{"text":"No lie, gave my whole family food poisoning. Other experiences have been way better, but sadly I don't think I'm going to return so be warned!"}
{"text":"I'm going with 3 stars tonight... order looks right except that my 3 orders of fries have that disgusting sweet seasoning on them EVERY TIME I order and either over the phone or online I select NO SEASONING! Why is it an option if your not going to read the ticket! I then have to either just take them so my food is hot, or ask them for fresh fries and now wait while my chicken gets cold! This sucks! Please read the tickets or change these to plain fries and give people the option to ADD seasoning!"}
{"text":"The lemon pepper chicken wangs here are finger licking good."}
{"text":"Jocey showed great customer service skills on my Wingstop visit today. Simplified the menu for me to make it easy. Thanks"}
{"text":"The food was good, it did take a bit but I expected that after reading reviews. The staff was amazingly nice and very helpful. My only thing is the price.. It seemed a little expensive for some wings without a server."}
{"text":"The fries - its all about the fries mostly. Fresh cut and still in their skin, these are long and tasty pieces of potatoes. It clearly brought me back to an East Coast boardwalk or any boardwalk where you find those fries that they stuff into a cup at like $6 for a cup, but nobody cares because they are just so darned tasty. Ok, back to the wings, I ordered a 6 piece combo deal of boneless wings in Hickory smoked BBQ sauce. These were solid white meat and crunchy on the outside which was perfect to dip into my blue cheese that surprised me with some actual chunks of the cheese floating in the dressing. Also, like that wacky soda fountain where you just push a button and you can have like 100 different choices. Fanta Orange Zero was new to me.
   Well, the reason I got those fries was because I didn't notice the giant stand up poster advertising Boneless Wings for 50 cents on Monday and Tuesday and the nice young girl at the counter never mentioned the deal either. I would have skipped those fries if I was in the know, so it turned out decent. Also, minus a star for the dude (manager?) who was wearing his hat backwards in the store and then decides to smoke his cigarette semi-close to where I was eating at 10pm at their outside tables. Although, I didn't really catch too much of the cig smell, this dude clearly shoulodn't be smoking right outside in the front. If I had seen that before I entered, it would have been a quick U-Turn. Overall though, food was good for a Wing joint and good help is hard to find anyway these days."}
{"text":"OMFG!!! Yes its that good. if you've never had wing stop then you havent lived. YES ITS THAT SERIOUS"}
{"text":"So apparently if you arrive 20 minutes before closing they refuse to take your order. This was my first time going and I love hot wings, but I also like good service. I will not be going back to try these. Oh well..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Wing Stop.  Overall, I had a good experience.  I ordered an individual combo online (8 classic wings with fries and a drink for about $8). I was given a pickup time of 25 minutes later. When I picked up my order (2 minutes after the pickup time), it was ready, and waiting on a small table just behind the cashier.  The cashier was fast, not overly friendly or peppy, but efficient and business like.  Not a huge turnoff, but not a stellar impression, either.  More important to me was that my order was ready on time, correct, and I was in and out quickly - all of which exceeded my expectations.

This location does *not* have the Coke Freestyle machine (as advertised at \"select locations\" on their website), by the way.  Fountain drinks included  Coke, Diet Coke (I think), some kind of punch, Minute Maid lemonade, Dr. Pepper and a couple of iced tea flavors (separate from the fountain dispenser).

So, the food.  I am one of those that can not deal with spicy foods, even fake spicy - like Taco Bell.  However, I do get cravings for honey wings, which most places do not have.  I first had them at Final Round (bar in Tempe), and the craving haunts me from time to time.  :-)  Wing Stop had a better flavor selection than most restaurants in my work area, including teriyaki and Hawaiian, so those are the two flavors I ordered.  I was not disappointed.  I had to try one of each of them right away (partially because I had been looking up wing joints for an hour previous to actually ordering and was more than ready to eat - partially to see if they were lukewarm from sitting out on a table prior to my arrival).  The temperature was perfect - nice and warm without being too hot to eat comfortably, the meat was juicy and tender, and the sauce was thick in consistency and applied liberally.  The Hawaiian wings had the honey flavor I was looking for with just a hint of pineapple in them.  The teriyaki wings tasted more soy saucey than most, and, as a result, were more salty than sweet.  Now, the fries.  Someone else wrote a review mentioning them, so I was forewarned.  It was a very strange experience eating them.  My taste buds were both intrigued and disgusted.  First it was sweet (ooooh!), then my brain kicked in and was like \"What?!? You're supposed to taste like potatoes and salt - not pancakes!\"  Suffice to say, all but 3 of the fries went to waste.  When I was able to sit down and eat the rest of the wings 25 minutes after my initial order pick up, the wings had maintained their perfect temperature, which is a big deal to me.

Is Wing Stop my new favorite place?  No, just by virtue of their specialty (and limited menu as a result).  I did, however, have a good experience overall, and know where I can meet my honey wings craving during business hours.  Will I return?  Probably.  The Hawaiian wings hit the spot (next time I'm getting those only!), and I'll have no problem remembering to NOT get the fries again.

Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend!  

Was not sure what to order. Ask the lady at the front counter about options. My friend had these coupons he wanted to use, so she got her shift lead, Nancy for assistance. Nancy had a mini meeting in front of us, LITERALLY turned their backs to us at the counter just to say the coupon couldn't be used. (It was a corporate coupon that wasn't expired, Nancy told us that it didn't have the location on it!  Cool, fine, whatever!)

Nancy, the shift lead, first  is very professional, however I felt that she lack personality and the subtle ways of interacting with customers. Which I think is the reason why I'm giving this review a 1 Star!

I will NEVER come back to this establishment again because of the borderline rudeness I got from Nancy. She made me felt slightly less welcome as if I was an annoyance or rowdy customer. I was in a great mood, having a great time with a friend that I hadn't seen in a while. At one point I almost wanted to just canceled my order due to the coldness I got from Nancy!  

As far as the food, it was standard. I ordered the mango habanero and garlic parmesan boneless wings with veggies sticks. Same standard fried bones less wings that you'd get anywhere. They came out in a timely manner. Taste was as expected. 

The restaurant was clean and appropriate. The atmosphere was ok, they have chairs and huge TVs for viewing in the dining room. Nothing special. 

Parking was convenient, free out in a sharing shopping strip. 

Overall, the restaurant is decent, I would have given it a 3.5, but due to the total coldness I got from the shift lead, Nancy from the beginning, I will never come to a wing stop restaurant again!"}
{"text":"My boss and I wanted something quick & tasty for our 30 minute lunch. We ordered a simple 20 wing Original Hot to split between us and requested the pick-up time online for 11:45 am. (They open at 11 am & lunch for us is @ 11:30 so it should have worked out.) We got there, with a coupon in hand, and stood there for a good 10 minutes while the cashier figured out the coupon code we had printed out. No one said a thing to either of us and processed the coupon. I came back to the counter to order a To-Go combo for another co-worker and the owner came up, interrupting the cashier, and proceeded to tell me the coupon we gave was BOGUS. He then told me we had to pay the difference. It was already Noon, mind you, and we still hadn't received our 11:45 order that was completed online at 10:50 am... My boss asked why the coupon was even processed in the first place if it wasn't valid. The owner simply said \"That's just how it is when you give us a BOGUS coupon.\" My boss was furious. We were going to have other coworkers join us the next trip but needless to say that isn't happening. That was my first and my last trip to that location... I'm sad they weren't even accommodating to a first-time customer who didn't intentionally try to pass off a bad coupon. The service from the cashier was okay but the owner really sealed the bad customer experience with his tone and disregard for customers in the store. I won't be spending my money there again... Boo on an online system that isn't even utilized."}
{"text":"This location is not consistent with the Wing Stop on Craig Road. I went twice this week with a co-worker and the first time the fries appeared to be over cooked. I ordered the garlic  parmesean chicken were ok but not enough parmesean on the chicken. The only reason I am giving this a 3 star is because I came back with 3 other co-workers who said they reallt enjoyed their chicken. Their sides were the carrots and the corn cobb. On my second visit the fries were a bit better but still not as good as the fries at the Craig location."}
{"text":"Slooooooooowwwwww.  I tried ordering online so the food would be ready when I got there, or shortly thereafter.  WRONG!!  I actually waited an additional 40 minutes after I arrived.  

I love Wing Stop, but this location needs improvement in a very bad way.  I will have to find another location for my fix."}
{"text":"I love my chicken... I've been coming here & ordering online at this location. Service has been so much better since I encountered Cheyenne. (Hope I'm spelling her name correctly). What a pleasant personality & superb customer service. She's so welcoming and assertive. Thank you for your smiling face ;)"}
{"text":"Better than Buffalo Wild Wings that's for sure . The chicken is delicious and the various choices of flavors is great . I wish they had fried pickles but the food is still good ."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give them a star. Thought wings would be good for dinner tonight. Came in ordered at 7:14 they told us 20 minutes until the food would be ready.. thought that was a little long but whatever we sat down and waited. 30 minutes pass and our food is still not given to us. The cook apparently just put them on a table next to us. I went up to the counter after a while of being frustrated about the food not being here.. asked the girl who took our order where our food was? She asked around and then just offered us a refund. I want my food. After they told us they would remake it. That's fine I sat down. She located my food on a random table. Mind you it's probably been sitting there for a good 15 minutes. She bring the old food back to my table like everything is okay now. I went back up to the counter and asked if they were still remaking my food? She said 5-10 more minutes. I'm pretty upset by this point. The other employee got some food and sat down to eat. The cook who made the mistake kept side eyeing me. The girl who took our order gave us some fries and told us about 10 more minutes. 10 more minutes pass. 15 minutes pass.. I go up to the counter she tells me the cook is giving her attitude and was calling her stupid for HIS mistake. Unacceptable. The girl with the flower of life tattoo really tried her best to accommodate, I believe her name was Lauren. She said she would give us a free 20 piece next time and refunded us for the order. Took my name down and apologized. After about 10 more minutes she was the one who had to plate the food and finally give it to me. I had to take my order to my own table which was kinda dumb but whatever we ate our food and left. It was miserable and embarrassing...for you guys."}
{"text":"I haven't even got my food yet, but it's already starting bad. The lady automatically  upsize my drink without asking and charges me an extra sauce when I already get two. Then I ask her about the charges and she doesn't own up to it. She says, you don't want to upsize your drink or the extra sauce?? Both were her upgrades or additions she made. Hopefully the food isn't messed up."}
{"text":"I love wing stop and prefer it over buffalo wild wings.  I always order online and have never had an issue.  This is inside the Santa fe casino so I hate how I have to walk through smoke to get the wings..... wish there was a car side service.... I would pay extra for that! The wings are substantially large, I love the garlic parm, hot, and lemon pepper. SO YUMMY. Their homemade ranch is bomb too. I always get extra and save the left over ranch for my carrots the next day. It does take about 10-18 minutes to cook the wings... they are made to order but super fresh. A lot of my friends are huge fans of the fries but I'm not one to order their fries.... soggy, greasy,  but has an interesting seasoning. I like my fries to be crispy. Just personal preference."}
{"text":"Wing Stop really is probably the best place for wings in Vegas. In fact, some of the best wings anywhere. And if I know anything, I know wings.

Wing Stop is quick, easy, and delicious. And I really have no complaints about this location.

The boneless wings seem to leave something to be desired. Same with the newer additions to their menu. Just stick to the basics. Go with the standard wings and fries.  

The original hot and cajun are my favorite flavors. Sometimes I'm feeling frisky and opt for the atomic. Even better, I order half original hot, half cajun, and get a side of the atomic sauce (yep, they will do that).

Be sure to order the wings wet. The star of the show here is the sauce. Go extra wet.

And don't forget the cheese sauce for the fries.

For me, it takes 4 things to be a great wing place:

1) The wings themselves must be of good quality. White and meaty.  *check*

2) The sauce covering the wings must be exceptionally delicious and spicy.  *check*

3) The dipping sauces must be excellent. All too often, great wings are ruined by horrible blue cheese sauce. But not here. Wing Stop has some of the best blue cheese sauce I have ever had. And the ranch is pretty good too.  *check*

4) There has to be a good side to go with the wings. And the fries at Wing Stop, especially with the cheese sauce, are well above average.  *check*

So yeah, go get some wings from here."}
{"text":"Not so impressed 
Clean place .friendly service
Visited during lunch few ppl in front of me not busy at all.
Ordered 10pce classic. 2 flavors hot and Louisiana rub.
Wings were cooked well and on time.
 love the fact you can split flavors on small orders.

The hot wings...more like mild! 
deep red sauce not on the vinagery side but not hot at all.
 they don't offer mild or buffalo, imo every wing place should pay homage to Buffalo with a traditional Buffalo sauce.

Louisiana Dry rub. Nice n crispy 
Again not much heat but rather on the salty side.

Also was not offered any sauces on the side.

 Over all in a pinch i would come back for a quick wing fix, if in the area. But there are better wings out here."}
{"text":"Wingstop is absolutely the best chain wings around. By far. Great quality. Excellent sauces. Wonderful ranch and blue cheese. Their fries, potato salad, etc. are also all good.

We ordered a very large order from this location. We used the Wingstop app and it was easy breezy. Our order was ready on time. Was 100% correct. And it was packaged very well.

Kuddos to the staff here for handling such a large order with little notice and getting everything right."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and accommodating. However, the wings themselves left much to be desired. My wife and I both ordered the Louisiana rub wings. She ordered the boneless (which were way over cooked) and I had the classic. The Louisiana Rub was extremely salty almost to the point of being unpalatable. The fries turned out to be the shining star of this meal. Overall, a less than impressive dining experience."}
{"text":"Wingstop is amazing! I have been coming to this location for about 3 years and always received great customer service and the food is always so good! And there's so much room for me & my friends to always go eat there! Love this place, it will forever be my favorite!"}
{"text":"Ate in and had a draft beer. Tasty wings. Boneless were breaded and nicely coated with sauce. Juicy inside. $.60 boneless wings on Monday and Tuesdays. Their regular wings are crispy. Had the garlic Parmesan flavor. Hubby's favorite. Fresh cut fries were yummy. Veggies and sauce are extra.More of a carry out place but dining room was clean and had Sports on TV. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Service was very quick and the wings were perfect. I will definitely return again.
Don't forget to get ranch the best ranch ever! I ordered my food online which didn't take long. It took less than 20 minutes till my food was hot and ready. See you all soon."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars I would. I called in an order for the wing combo ( 6 wings, fries, and a drink) they said it would be ready in 18 min, when I showed up I payed at the counter and took a seat to wait for my order. Sat there waited for awhile. They usually call your name out when your food is ready, not once did I hear my name and trust me I was paying attention I was hungry, 4 customers got they're food before me. It wasn't til I went up to the counter to ask for my food, that they have it to me. It had been sitting there this whole time! My fries and wings were cold. The 3 ladies that were there weren't even busy, one was on her phone the whole time, maybe if they put that damn cell phone down and focus on Custer service they would get better reviews ."}
{"text":"Update:  since my visit one month ago, I was contacted by Wingstop and invited to retry them with an offer of free wings.  Unbeknownst to them, I went on my own two weeks ago and the service was excellent.  I even had the same person who tried to make good last time take my order and had my wings ready in 17min, although they didn't make them well done as I asked.

Today I called in an order well done and Marbella said 25min.  She was at the counter to greet me, take payment, and my wings were ready inside of the 25 min wait period despite having a busy crowd to cater to.  Kudos to you Wingstop on the two saves."}
{"text":"On the wings of love!

No doubt that chicken wings have been around all of us since were young and didn't know it yet. They've filled our living rooms during football season, Sunday afternoons at the in-law's house, your cousin's girlfriend's baby brother's daughter's birthday party. And most of all, they're tied for number #1 reason to lick your fingers next to BBQ ribs! I've been all over the U.S. and I have yet to find wings and service as great as Wingstop on Craig Road! I don't eat in the restaurant as often as I used because I like to watch a movie with my girlfriend so I'll make a call to place the order.  When I do eat in, they have old school R&B music playing through the speakers at night and I love Motown! I've gone here a few times by myself and spent a little QT just vibing with the ambiance.

Best service! They always say \"14 minutes\" and they've never gotten anything wrong with my order. Sometimes though, sometimes they tend to get my name wrong but I understand my name doesn't make that task very easy.  I'll get Ahmed, Arman, and I even got Ivan. I usually give my nickname because it's easier.... failed plan! Some patrons may find that a bit annoying but personally, I find it amusing. I've turned the incorrect names I've gotten into a game. I'm planning to make a scrapbook and story of all the times and moments.  It comes with having a unique name right? :) Make sure they get your name right if you don't find that amusing though.

The different flavors are what makes this place a neighborhood favorite. My personal favorites are the Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan. I prefer the \"flats\" as oppose to the drummettes. I also order my fries extra crispy! I make sure I have bleu cheese and my order is set to go! I also like their Hot flavor.  It has a sour zing to them (probably from vinegar in the sauce) which I enjoy a bunch! All the other flavors are good as well but the aforementioned are my personal faves! Enjoy and happy eating! :)"}
{"text":"Having problems rating Wingstop.  The food is good and I've eaten here many times through the years. The staff is friendly and the fries are really good and I love the iced tea.  My problem with Wingstop is the fact that they raised their prices and decreased the number of wings in an order. So in essence, customers are paying a lot more for a lot less.  Not sure how that makes sense.  Especially when there are other 'wing' places in the nearby vicinity with reasonable prices and wings that taste just as good as Wingstop's. I was floored when I saw what Wingstop did with their prices and menu. The wings are not bigger than before the price increase/food decrease; the wings are not rubbed in gold; the wings dont stand at attention before i eat them so not sure why the 'brains' at Wingstop thought it was a good idea to increase their prices and give less food. This really boggles my mind. Whatever the case, I'm done with Wingstop. I will patronize one of the other 'wing' places that are nearby.  I just cannot give my business to Wingstop anymore as I'm finding it really hard to make peace with what they have done. Had the wings gotten bigger somehow or SOMETHING was done to justify their senseless act, maybe, just maybe I would continue being a customer.  But decreasing portions and raising prices as much as they did is the straw that breaks the camel's back for me.  I just cant.  Thank God for other choices!"}
{"text":"I would rate my wings with four stars but the service was terrible so that made the rating go down. My boyfriend placed our to go order over the phone and it was on speaker so I heard the whole conversation. He told her that he wanted 8 Louisiana rub, 8 Korean bbq, and 8 lemon pepper. She repeats the order at the end asking \"So you want 8 Korean bbq, Louisiana rub, and lemon pepper?\" We go to pick it up and she asks for his name and she says \"We don't have an order for Kyle.\" She then realizes that what's supposed to be our order is set aside so he's ready to pay only to find out she charged us for 8 wings total. He explained that he ordered a total of 24 but 8 in each flavor. Rather than admitting to her mistake or apologizing and fixing the problem, she copped an attitude and said \"Well, that's not what you said. I even repeated the order to you.\" Maybe it was our mistake by not specifying that we wanted 24 total, but it was rude to automatically point the finger at us. Anyone with common sense would realize that 8 of each 3 flavors means 24 total. So he asks her how long it will be til the rest of the order is done. I ate some of the wings as we waited and my boyfriend asks her for a water cup. She says \"We ran out of water cups.\" He asks,\"Would you be able to give me a regular cup to drink some water while I wait?\" She says \"I can't just give you a cup and we are low on water bottles.\" Then he says, \"you can't just give me a cup to drink some water while I wait for my to go order that didn't come out right?\" She then hands him the cup and says \"In the future, you can't just get a cup.\" I work in the service industry and know that you should never get defensive and blame your customer. Even if they are wrong, you should always do your best to fix the issue without having a bad attitude. I hate leaving this place with two stars because I love their wings, but Angelica's lack of customer service was disappointing..."}
{"text":"Great wings...thanks to no air conditioning at Burrito Loco...tried this highly rated wing place next door. Bottom line some of the best winds anywhere. Great French fries to go along with. Highly recommended...courteous staff as well.

If you're in the area and want wings don't pass this up."}
{"text":"I'd have to say the customer service is excellent at this location. I've called in my order quite a few times and the staff has always been friendly. Plus the wings are always great!"}
{"text":"This place has good wings, but kind of pricey for the quality you get. I had to wait almost an hour once for wings, and I don't really know if it's worth it. Do not order online because the wait time is not correct."}
{"text":"Been here three times. Order takers always nice, orders always correct, employees seemed like good people, food tastes like a Wingstop but the restaurant is filthy. 

Complete fail on the part of Owner, Regional,District and Store Management. 

The order counter had a visible layer of shiny oily residue on it, the sides looked like they were cleaned haphazardly with an inadequate cleaning solution (dirty or diluted solution), dirty windows (lower fogged windows with broken seals add to the effect), poorly mopped floor, my food was presented in an oily streaky the styrofoam container with the wings was coated with hot-sauce finger prints and bagged horizontally with the fries.  It seemed like there was minimal training, perhaps no continuing training and that the employees were just left to \"wing it\".

Undoubtably the duty of the management team to ensure the employees are properly trained and maintaining standards and to identify and correct short-comings. This approach not only provides a good customer experience but more importantly teaches employees to have an eye for detail, to follow procedure and take their own corrective actions; skills which will be a positive influence on their professional growth. 

So, not really a chicken wing review so much as a shoutout to corporate and to the owner to take a look at where you are failing and to do a better job at teaching your employees to succeed.  

BTW, where's the effing trash can?!"}
{"text":"Wingstop is definitely one of my favorite wing places. Yes it is a chain, but the food is always consistent and it's reasonably priced. This location is pretty close to work, so when I am in the mood for wings I always order online and my food is ready by the time I get there. I always order at least an hour or two in advance, and just choose a 12:15 pickup time. They are usually busy, more so around lunchtime, so be prepared for a 20 minute wait if you walk in. I love the fact that you can get all drums or all flats (my choice) for a small up charge, this alone is worthy of an extra star. I hate those damn drumettes. 

I usually order the 6 piece traditional wing combo, flats only, with lemon pepper and garlic parmesan flavors. I like that you can pick up to 2 flavors, even for only 6 wings at no additional charge. The combo comes with 1 side (go with the fries), 1 dip, either ranch (bomb) or blue cheese for you mold lovers, as well as a drink for around $10. This is a LOT of food and you will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Wing Stop for years!  This location has been great until now. Yesterday I got my wings for the big game and they were small and over cooked. I would like a refund for the 40 wings that were purchased. I'll call and see what the owner/manager says. Otherwise it's a good place. I'm chalking this up to Super Bowl. I did however call my order in 3 days prior.  Just got off the phone with them they made it right."}
{"text":"Wing stop is the worst. When we went in you have to order and wait 20 mins for an order of boneless wings and fries. We ordered hickory bbq, garlic parm, Hawaiian, and lemon pepper. What the dont tell you is that some of them are dry rubs and not sauces so the lemon pepper and garlic parm just tasted liked extremely over seasoned chicken that needs sauce. The hickory bbq was quite spicy which was an unwelcome surprise. The Hawaiian was watered down and tasted more like watered down pineapple than anything else. 

In addition to the bad wing experience. The fries tasted like Snyder bbq chips with the seasoning which was weird because they werent supposed to be bbq.

Also they did not have a baby changing station which is super inconvenient and such a hassle to change your kid without one. Overall i wouldn't recommend to anyone and would rather wait to have wings during bw3 wing special night. Dont waste your money."}
{"text":"Got 1/3 orders correct. The pressure of working minimum wage must be very high and since I couldn't do anything about my orders being wrong they left me on hold for a good while. Thumbs dooooown. At least hire some people with common sense."}
{"text":"Great place to get your wing fix! Lots of great flavors to choose from and get them bone in, boneless, or as tenders! Lots of great sides to choose from as well!  

Boneless Hawaiian is a personal favorite."}
{"text":"All I have to say is CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFOE YOU LEAVE. 85% chance that They will either have it completely wrong or give you a 2cm tidbit of chicken and count it as one of your wings. Boneless wings are sometimes rubbery too. Management seems to be really trying to fix all the fxck ups and keep the employees in order."}
{"text":"Food is the same as at every Wingstop in America, but that's not a bad thing - consistency is nice in a chain location.  That said, the highlight of this Wingstop is the service! I was amazed at how friendly and willing to help the staff were. By far better than many sit down restaurants I have been to. Go here and eat in just for the wonderful service."}
{"text":"I am big on Wingstop. Love eating them wherever I go. Granted, as with any franchise, you're bound to have some good and some bad. Well, this one is down there with the bad. It's the first Wingstop I've been to that is a Sports themed franchise. It appears to double as a Cowboys fans meeting place to watch their teams games, given the Cowboys jerseys they have hung around the place.

At any rate, back to this review... Went to this location last Friday evening, around 10pm. Granted, this place closes at midnight, but it appeared that the staff here were more worried about getting their weekend started, than actually being courteous to patrons. The line was several people long, and only one cashier taking orders, while some of the other workers were chit-chatting on the side, and texting on their phones, all the while the line kept growing bigger.

I noticed this place has some type of loaded fries that other Wingstops dont offer, with some hot/spicy toppings. I am not into spicy food, so I just ordered my standard 10 wings bone-in combo. 

They give you a number which you take to a seat and you wait on them to bring you your food. What we didn't like about this location, and I am sure it's a health violation, is that they had a Wringer Mop Bucket, with dirty water in it, and a mop in it, WITHIN the seating area, next to a table. That's kind of nasty, to be eating around a bucket with dirty water within 10 feet of you. Not only that, but the table that it was near, had a small bucket of dirty water that the employees were using to clean up tables with. Pretty disgusting, and again, very sure that's some type of violation to have janitorial supplies out and about in the dining area while there are patrons in the place, and well before it is closing time. 

When we got our food, we had to ask for extra lemon pepper seasoning, because they 'forgot' to season our lemon pepper wings -- Like really tho? Yep! On top of that they forgot some of the extra dips we ordered, so we asked and they brought us extras.

Overall, for this being the closest Wingstop to the Strip, you would THINK they'd have their stuff together, especially on a weekend evening, but sadly, they don't. I wish the management of this specific Wingstop actually read some of these reviews. As paying patrons, I think it's only fair that patrons expect at the very least sanitary (up to code) dining conditions when dining in. 

Definitely don't plan on returning to this location."}
{"text":"So far, every time I've gone, super friendly staff. Orders correct, food tastes good. A great addition to this north Las Vegas area. Hope they can keep up the service and friendliness they give now, if they do they'll stay in business for a long time. I personally always order the wings well done, since that makes them extra crunchy..oh and get just regular wings, their other flavors, good, but not as good as Bdubs."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! As an unofficial wing connoisseur, BWW was the front runner - not any more people.  I ordered via their app for take out - yes their app which is SUPER convenient and my order was waiting for me when I got there.  Their wings are Atkins friendly and most of their sauces too.  Thier wing prices are also less than BWW.  Mmm Hmm. So we ordered the 30 wing count with 3 different sauces, 2 orders of celery only, and 2 orders of blue cheese.  The sauces were really good - the cajun - buttery spicey goodness.  Totally cravable.  Their blue cheese dipping sauce, REAL blue cheese and NOT runny watery grossness.  Ya know, sometimes it's the little things that make me HAPPY.  They have many sizes of wings especially if you want to get some for a party.  They are also known for their yeast rolls which I've had pre-atkins and those are heavenly.  Wingstop is our new go to for wing cravings!!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped at Wingstop for a quick light lunch. I wanted the 6 piece boneless,no fries and a drink. Then the dopey kid behind the counter informs me that to get boneless without a side dish I have to order 10 pieces. What?? Back into my work truck I go and off to The Chicken Shack on Sunset where they know how to take care of their customers. Never again Wingstop!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to  say that this is the best place in las Vegas, nv. They have very nice people working there. I was in a very bad situationthe other day and they extended their hand to me in big way and I appreciate all their help."}
{"text":"Horrible. Just horrible. This is the second time I've been here and both times my experience has been the same. The employees taking orders aren't friendly and seem like they're being bothered having to work. The wings I ordered were not freshly prepared. They were luke-warm and dry. Clearly they were pre-made and sitting out for a while. Maybe they're trying to save time or be efficient by doing that but it's not working. Also, their sweet tea is also barely sweetened. The only good thing about this place is that they have a lot of TV's to watch sporting events. 
I normally go to the Spring Mountain location where the wings are prepared to order and service is friendly. 
Don't bother wasting your time and money at this location. From now on, I'll only go to the Spring Mountain location, it's worth the extra drive."}
{"text":"Waiting time about 20 min. Wings were dry, over cooked and the fries salty and nasty. Didn't like it at all."}
{"text":"I
Usually love this place! I give a poor review as my last 3 take out orders were horrendous. There was so much oil pooled in the container that the wings were barely edible and all the dry rub was rubbed off. I have worked in restaraunts for years in my younger days and simply allowing the wings to drain in the basket a little longer would remedy this. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I like my chicken wings a certain way...cooked thoroughly, not slimy, and with the sauce clinging to the chicken! 


Wingstop does all that and I agree, the french fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Wing Stop has awesome wings. They're huge, they're crispy like they should be, and the sauces and sides are fantastic. They've quickly become my second favorite wings in Pittsburgh behind Wings, Suds, and Spuds. I had never been to any of the other locations before, so when I saw this one was opening right down the hill from me, I was more than eager to finally try them out.

I've tried nearly every flavor on the menu here, save for the teriyaki. My three favorites would be classic hot, Louisiana dry rub, and Hawaiian. The seasoned fresh cut fries are amazing, but I seriously love the baked beans here. The cole slaw is really good and the potato salad is top notch. They also give you enough blue cheese, ranch, or whatever your preferred dip is that you won't feel like you've been cheated and need to order more at an additional cost (I'm looking at you, B-Dubs).

Since opening, I've gone here so many times that I may as well be a chicken wing by this point. The only problem I have with this location is that they obviously need more help. Seriously. The crew here is incredibly friendly, but more employees are seriously needed. They average every order to be ready in 20-25 minutes, but on a super busy night, this can easily stretch to almost an hour because they get backed up with in house orders as well as phone-in and online orders. I used the mobile app a couple weeks ago to pick up my food on the way home from work and I wound up sitting there for an extra 30 minutes after arriving on time to pick it up. They were just that slammed and didn't even have mine started.

Other than that, the food is amazingly excellent. I was wary of it being a chain and all, but these guys do wings the way I love them, plus I can even get them well done if I want them even crispier. I dig the inclusion of Fanta strawberry pop in the fountain. It perfectly complements the wings here like Mountain Dew perfectly complements anything at Taco Bell, or Dr. Pepper makes everything at Sonic taste even groovier. 

One other thing. If you want to use the restrooms here, they're locked and a crew member has to take you back and unlock the door for you. I don't know how long his policy will last, and if it's something all the locations do. It will undoubtedly keep the bathrooms cleaner and stop would-be graffiti goons from tagging up the walls, but it can also be a bit annoying when the place is busy and everyone's trying to take and fill orders.

The restaurant is super clean, and I dig the classic jazz music they play here. It's definitely not the kind of tunes I was expecting to hear when I first walked in. Since I'm writing this review near Christmas, they have switched over to all Christmas tunes as expected, but generally it's some tasty jazz from the greats.

So please, Wing Stop, hire some more folks and really start cranking those orders out. I love your food and personally don't mind that wait most times, but you can see the looks of agitation on other people's faces as they wait and wait. Otherwise, you're doing everything perfectly. Thanks for opening near me!"}
{"text":"We ordered online which was an easy process.  I arrived 5 min before the order was supposed to be ready.  I was promptly greeted when I walked in and my order was ready.  The food was awesome and fresh.   We will definitely order again.  It's nice to order food from an establishment online and actually have a normal pick up time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure with others giving this location a 1star, they just throwing shade. I've been coming here for sometime now and they have always been fast with the app order and phone orders. Wings are always done to perfect. Love the cheese fries. You can truly never go wrong with their wing flavors. My fav are original hot and lemon pepper"}
{"text":"Wingstop beats Buffalo Wild Wings any day. Hands down.

No matter what location I come to, Wingstop's wings are always crispy, juicy, and flavored to perfection. The fries are hand cut pair deliciously with ranch. Or sometimes if I'm wanting a lighter option, I'll order all celery sticks as a side in lieu of fries.

I just wish this location had the mega soda dispenser like most Wingstop locations, however, it only has a regular soda fountain with minimal drink options."}
{"text":"My sister is in the hospital at Chandler Regional and my daughter came to visit her and decided to take me to Wing Stop. First when I walked in I was greeted with an amazing smiling gentlemen by the name of Miguel. He was was his customer service was out of this world and for it to be almost closing he he didn't rush us or make us feel like we needed to leave. The place was clean and smelled good. Thank you Miguel for giving us A+ service."}
{"text":"Worst service and mediocre wings. Took 2 hours only to receive half of my order, then were very hesitant to give a refund. Super sketchy, don't recommend."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! My chicken wings were under cooked I told the manager he said that to him they looked cooked and I pulled it apart and showed him the pink meat and he grabbed them and tossed them in the trash. I said I had to wait 25 minutes because they had a lot of orders and walked away no apology or anything. If I could I wouldn't even give them one star. This will be the last time I come eat here."}
{"text":"If you rate this place less than 4 stars and think BWW is better than Wing Stop there is something wrong with you and are NOT a wing expert.

Hands down this is the best wing place in down. The wings are made to order unlike BWW where they place them in a warming oven (why do  you think they come out so fast?). They have less fewer flavors for the wings than BWW but the choices they offer are really great - I always go for the Orginal Hot...they are not too hot but not too mild, very flavorful and this is sauce that is finger-looking good!

I also  would suggest the fries, they are awsome as well!! They put a sugar salt on them that made them very tasty!! The staff is always friendly and always pretty steady with customers."}
{"text":"This place is unlike the other wingstops in the valley, it's a more like a buffalo wild wings but not open 24 hours with 12 TV screens and a bar. Most people come here for the wings like myself, which I believe are hands down the best in town!! These wings are made to order, not like at Buffalo Wild Wings where they cook them ahead of time and place them in warming ovens - the sauce selection is not large compared to BWW but that is okay, since I like hot wings, I always get the original hot, extra wet!! The original hot is just hot enough for me but no too mild! They do have Cajan and Atomic Hot which is above Original Hot. If you are not into hot, they do have milder flavors including lemon pepper and hawaiian.

How is the place like BWW you ask? They have an expanded menu that includes wraps, sandwiches and burgers! Plus a bar that have several beers on tap!

One of my favorite foods is chicken wings and I am very confident that this place has the best wings in town!!  Give this place a shot, you will not be disappointed! 


I am not sure what Elizabeth or others are thinking but their reviews are WAY off base. Elizabeth seems to be basing her review on people asking her question, this place only opened up a few day before she posted her review - get over it, they want to make sure you are being taken care of plus they are new employees. My rating is based on 1) The quality of the food 2) The customer service 3) Atmosphere 4) Overall experience. I have been to wing cook off in the past - including the buffalo chicken wing festival in Buffalo, NY."}
{"text":"Literally had to leave mid bite of my first wing, love the wings, but when I see more flies around me than wings in by container ITS TIME TO GO!!! Why are there so many flies???? So gross, not like we camping outside eating, this is indoors!!! And the fact that I needed two hands to count the amount of flies just around my table is WRONG!!!"}
{"text":"This wingstop is awesome! Boneless Mondays and Tuesdays are a bargain. Plus they give military discount on these days too! The wings are bigger size than Buffalo Wild Wings which is very refreshing, you get more bang for your buck! Congratulations on a job well done! (As said in the Navy)"}
{"text":"Just an A-OK wing joint. Nothing particularly special. If you're passing by the area and are looking for some wings, you could do worse. Definitely don't make a special trip."}
{"text":"What a Joke.   Preordered wings for the Super Bowl.     Managements name was Casper... He/she was basically a ghost!   Left the poor girls upfront to fight off the crowd.   One would have thought they were giving something away with that size of crowd.    My order was \"lost.\" Then they checked again and \"found it\". Quoted 25 minutes for the order.   Everyone knew that was a lie. I walked out and ordered a pizza.     The girls on the front line were very nice but very poor management.   Only one to blame was the cowardly lion, they call management."}
{"text":"I was very hesitant whether to give them 3 stars or 4... Here's why. 

I love wings, especially coming here so often I love their lemon pepper wings. Their wings are just a hit and miss sometimes. Sometimes, they take FOREVER and sometimes the service is really quick. Everyone here is pretty much straight forward... Not nice and not mean. They are there to just take your order and cook it for you. Tables don't really get clean and the size of the restaurant is pretty small.
As for the food, it just wings. Nothing special.. They do have good wings. Its just basic sauce for wings, mild, medium, hot, buffalo, bbq. Although, their dry wings are the best I've encountered. My favs are Louisiana Rub and Lemon Pepper."}
{"text":"Terrible place ! Called and put on hold for 8 long minutes, get there then wait 25 minutes for 6 wings and fries!? Then it's 1$ for a small ranch? And food wasn't even good! Lady at counter and bad attitude"}
{"text":"We love Wingstop and the service there is friendly and fast! Wings stay crispy without getting soggy. We have purchased several times and there has only been one or two fatty wings in the whole bunch."}
{"text":"For Sunday football this place is not given the hype it needs. It was our first time dining here and we loved our dining experience. They have 10 TV'S. Every single one was a football game. Awesomeness! 
We ordered the 36 sport pack $44.99
- 4 orders of wings either boneless or with bone and your choice of 4 diffrent flavors
- can choose up to 4 diffrent sauces (cheese sauce, ranch, honey mustard, bleu cheese) 
- 2 large french fries
- veggie sticks 
- 2 pitchers of beer or 6 fountain drinks 
This deal is great for a party of 4 - 6 people! 
Annabell was our cashier. She was so nice and very helpful. She's has been very helpful in our past take out purchases. The location is very clean and not too noisy despite all the football commotion. Only one thing I do gotta say is that this place is REALLY REALLY COLD lol I love it! However my kids did need their blankets to keep them comfortable. But I'm not one to complain. Especially in this hot 100 plus degree desert. You can count on us to come back again!"}
{"text":"I always come here for my Wingstop because their chicken and fries are delicious. The service is excellent and the staff is friendly here too. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Wish I would have read the reviews before ordering. I ordered online hoping to save sometime and not have to wait. I showed up at pick up time, then waited 30 more minutes and still nothing, mind you it's Sunday night. No orders were going out, I finally asked for my money back. This is a wing spot, you're not making individual orders. Fry the wings, add the sauce. It should not take 50 minutes....don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"My son & I love to come here even though I suggested to try another place! He says they have the best wings! They were hot & fresh & the fries with the salty sugar they put on them...we got mild & bbq ! Wings are always good here!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place for lunch and found this spot in Yelp .... all I got to say is that the wings are real good and they even have Modelo ... oh yeah customer service was some of the best from a fast food spot ."}
{"text":"Service was great, place real clean but I expected the food to be much better than it was. I got the boneless chicken Louisiana style and it was over cooked. Too salty as well. Wasn't impressed with their chicken at all. Maybe if I wouldn't have gotten the boneless it would have been better. Who knows... Oh well!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some wings but I loved the service the best.
The guy running the place is a gem.  You could tell he loved his job and it was a p,ensure to see him in action while we ate out lunch that day.  I wish him great success in life"}
{"text":"I went in for a lunch on a friday. Food was excellect. The wings has good flavor and perfect crunch, and the fries were well seasoned and not flimsy. My server/cashier Dan and his associate (didnt get his name) were some of the most helpful and polite staff I have ever interacted with. Will DEFINITELY be coming here again, possibly soon, possibly with friends."}
{"text":"I am so upset at this location. Came in and I was greeted very nice. But it seems the staff here doesn't care about their promise wait time for their customers order. I was told that it will only take about 14 minutes for my order to be ready. I look at the receipt and I was rung out at 9:20pm, after waiting 28 minutes for my wings I got really fed up. This is just really ridiculous. I hate how they say its only 14 minutes but after 28 minutes I sat their was wondering if they are even working on my order. I am very upset and will probably never come to this location. 

It seems the staff is also very rude because when I left I saw them chit chatting and looking at me in a very rude way. Probably talking smack. Instead of doing business like that they should check themselves and treat EVERY CUSTOMER WITH RESPECT. Sorry but I am too upset to ever come near this location EVER!"}
{"text":"Wings are great. But the fries are perfect!!! Definitely recommend. 

Only downside? Takes a while for your food. Other than that? Prefer Wingstop over BWW any day!"}
{"text":"Fantastic wing place. We also like the owner Sam.  He is a great guy and will do everything he can to welcome you and get you anything he can"}
{"text":"Great staff and awesome wings that are fully cooked! I will drive across town to get the yummy lemon pepper ones. Family packs are a great deal and you can pre order online so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"The wings were amazing! Fresh and hot! The service was good to,I will definitely be back when I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Wing Stop.  I discovered this place when I lived in Texas and then was unable to have them for several years... but no more!

This is the closest location to my house and it's still about 15 minutes away (all streets) but damnit, I love this place.  I ordered about 25 wings (4 different flavors) and two sides of fries online on a Wednesday night and the site said 20 minutes.  Honestly, I didn't believe it.  But I drove over there and it was actually being bagged as I walked in the door.

Awesome. Just awesome.  Easy parking, super-friendly staff, very clean location and it looked like they had some great dine-in specials with beer.

Online they had a special for 60 cents per boneless wing, minimum 5, which is pretty good in my opinion.  I don't know if this is a consistent thing or not.

The french fries had much less sugar than I was used to, which certainly made me sad but they were still good with their delicious ranch sauce.

Their Louisiana rub packs quite a punch!  I think it's by far the hottest - Atomic is a joke compared to it.  Their Teriyaki is also still on point, and their BBQ was good to try once but I'm just not a huge fan of BBQ on chicken wings (I got some because I was sharing with friends who had never had Wing Stop).

I can't wait to go again.  I'm literally salivating at the thought while I type this.  n_n"}
{"text":"Garlic Parmesan and Lemon Pepper are my favorite wings here!  One of my favorite Chicken Wing places...especially if you are doing order to pick up.  They do have a small sit down area...nothing compared to Buffalo Wild Wings...but good enough.  I like how you can order over the phone and they can have your order ready.  There really isn't much to review other than it is your typical Chicken Wing place...but this location is pretty clean, nice and the staff are always on point and friendly.  If your order comes a little late than usual...they take care of their customers and hook it up with a lil something extra for the inconvenience.  Check them out if you love wings!."}
{"text":"The wings are good but be prepared to bend over with no lube.... that's 2$ extra. By far the most overpriced food in all of Arizona"}
{"text":"OK I am a sucker for wings.  I love them all unless they are afterthoughts like at many pizza joints.

Wingstop gets my votes for multiple flavor choices and the fact that they cook them after you order them.  Sure it takes a few more minutes, but you know they are fresh and crisp.

At this particular location they were very friendly and courteous.  The interious has an airplane motif, but otherwise it is non-descript."}
{"text":"Ate at this Wingstop recently. Food & service were great. Thank you to Angela & staff. We enjoyed ourselves & will be back when we are nearby"}
{"text":"The wings were dry and seemed old. Not much flavor either. 

The only cool thing is that my food was ready when I got there since I ordered through the app. It said 17 minutes and I got there in 15 and the food was done. 

But these wings are dry and flavorless. Never again."}
{"text":"I would do yourself a favor and skip this place, if not you will regret going here. I've been here twice and I hope there will never be a third.  Despite the awful taste and poor service, it however is pretty conveniently located with plenty of parking but that's where the good stops.  The first time at Wing Stop with a co-worker(and bestie), we ordered a variety of wings.  We ordered Lemon Pepper, Louisiana dry rub and a medium.  Let me tell you, the Lemon Pepper were so terrible, I felt like I was eating Tilapia or Orange Roughy.  This was by far the worst flavor I have ever tasted.  The other two were not as bad but were just not good, the flavor of both weren't appetizing at all.  The only thing that was any good was the large bucket side of ranch that was served with the wings and extremely soggy fries with a shovel full of salt.

On the 2nd trip with the same bestie co-worker [completely his choice this time, what a mistake]; I don't know why I agreed to it also.  I ordered one with dry rub [Cajun this time] and a Garlic Parmesan, and just when you think you couldn't get any worse than eating a Tilapia flavored chicken wing, these were much, much worse.  There was so much dry rub on the wings that I could have done the Lebron pregame chalk toss up in the area making a cloud of dust.  When we left Wing Stop, he said he needed to rip a 'cig to get the nasty taste out of his mouth. For a place that prides itself on flavor, it's done very poorly. 

Do yourself a favor, just go to Costco right behind this place and order something from the food court there.  I think they have pizza and hot dogs or you could get some chicken wings to put into the microwave that you would enjoy much more than these things at Wing Stop."}
{"text":"We came to try the fried corn and I liked it
Can't go wrong with chicken wings
My wife and I enjoyed this place"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that we attended the grand pre-opening and had great service and good...bonus that it was free. Our next visit however was disappointing. After ordering, we were told that it would be an 18 minute wait to ensure that our food was fresh... No problem. 25 minutes passed so my husband went to check on the order at the register. He was told to go to the kitchen window to check. We just then know the name on the order but continued to watch others get called that came in after us. A full 31 minutes after the order time on the receipt, the food was ready. No apologies for the wait. The three stars is because the wings and fries were fresh and good, however, after waiting over a half hour unexpectedly and being hungry, we truly were exhausted."}
{"text":"I enjoy this location over the rest in Vegas. It's decently sized so you actually have room although the tables are a bit close to each other it's bigger then the rest of the local WingStops. The service is typically good never had any problems. 

The one thing I can say is that it's FREEZING in here. I mean you really can sit back and enjoy your meal when your beyond cold. My son stopped eating halfway through our meal and asked to go outside cause he was so cold. We get it Vegas is HOT but the temperate of a dining area should be at a decent degree. To warm or to cold just makes customers feel out of place."}
{"text":"Wingstop is my favorite wing chain and it hurts to give a one star review, but the service we received at this location is terrible and deserving. I came here with family to order a family pack to eat in store and while we were waiting, we sipped on our water cups. My mom and I noticed that the water had a moldy aftertaste so she went to the front and discreetly told the woman working the register about the moldy taste in the water and she replied by saying, \"oh, I'll let the manager know.\" And right after we saw her go to he back to tell her manager, there was an audible man's laugh echoing from the back! Umm... really rude and obvious that the manager is laughing at a critique from a genuinely concerned customer?! Obviously it's not like we purchased waters, but as a former manager of a restaurant, I would've appreciated knowing about a potential mold problem in the drinking water of my store so that it could be addressed and fixed. 

We ended up asking to change our order to go just because we felt so uncomfortable. Here's to hoping our food isn't messed with..."}
{"text":"My favorite wingstop in Vegas.  People are always friendly. The wings here aren't the DUMB JUMBO wings but meaty and normal.  Never had a bad experience here.  If you are in the area, stop by. This is one of their newer restaurants, so it's very clean."}
{"text":"Great wings all the time . Dine in or Togo
 Very nice girls at the cashier as well .  I love the hickory smoked BBQ myself but the garlic Parmesan is amazing as well.  The mango habanero is a once and a while go to .. man that stuff is hot but good !"}
{"text":"I liked the wings, they were done right and the sauce was on point. I also liked the fries, and the celery and carrots. However the reason I didn't give this five stars is because it's honestly a little pricy. For a fast food-ish type place I'd expect it to be a little cheaper..."}
{"text":"I just love love love this place! Wingstop is delicious and affordable. My favorite would be their Louisiana Rub and Lemon Pepper with their fries. Their food is always made fresh. It takes a bit than most places, but the wait is always worth it. Their rolls are great too!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for mediocre wings and a long wait. Garlic and parmesan wings were literally dry wings with Parmesan powder on it."}
{"text":"I was craving hot fresh wings. Wingstop was amazing, as usual. However, the service at this location was on point! All of the staff were super personable. Worth yelping about it....."}
{"text":"This place I'll give 3 stars, customer service is ok. Fries are salty and the mild wings are always sooooo salty with very little mild sauce there too dry in my opinion. Although ordering online is very convenient."}
{"text":"I just don't understand the reasoning behind charging customers for dipping sauce. If a customer is buying 30 wings at $29. Why would you not include dipping sauce.. and why charge and additional almost $1 for a tiny container of ranch.  Even gross McDonald's includes a free sauce with their chicken nuggets. 

Any place that I spend almost $30 for something and still have to come out of my pocket and my own fridge for something , just isn't worth it.

The wings are mediocre compared to voodoo wings."}
{"text":"Joseline did an amazing job, had our order done fast and   as well as accurately had a ready to go smile and was more than helpful as far as her suggestions to get us exactly what we wanted without us spending to much ps. She deserves a Promotion"}
{"text":".89 cents per wing... Pricing is high for want we're being served. Everything is an add on... Bleu cheese extra. Free refill on the iced tea (sweetened) and sodas, good, and they have a beer license too, good. Order two styles, one habanero, the other one hot (not buffalo style, but the flavor was good for the hot), but only took one bite of the habanero and it was definitely not to my liking. It took 22 minutes for twenty (20) wings ordered for in-house dine. The music was a little too loud for us (and I guess for the service person too) since the order of Seasoned Fries (that my wife ordered) never came and after rereading our ticket, they were never placed. It was a chore to order with not hearing properly. Restaurant was very clean and upon using the restroom to wash up... There are NO mirrors in there...  Odd. Staff was very friendly though, another good plus."}
{"text":"It's a Wingstop. The food is okay at best. Not particularly moist and tasty. There are a few places that serve significantly better tasting wings close by.

You get okay value for your money."}
{"text":"Not good. atomic sauce is not hot enough tastes like cracked pepper. ..waaay too much. Mango habanero is way too sweet and has a funky stomach acid taste. You order two flavors and they're stacked on top of eachother in between paper.. not cool. then you order fries that taste like sugar is on top of them plus celery was like 2 days old at least.They should have never been served straight in the trash is where they belong.  super disappointed.  will not return!!"}
{"text":"I finally had to try this place a week or so ago as friends raved about it and honestly,  I don't get it they had a lot of option but the food was pretty average with rubbery fries and wings that were smaller tun regular wings and weird serving numbers.   The food was ok but making a moderately good wing unacceptable was the service.  They are slow and rude and spent more time thing to each other than the customers and the final strike was the pricing was kind of strange with everything being separate so you end up with average to ok good wings, mediocre sides and then they charged a fairly steep price for chicken wings.  sorry I wanted them to be great but can't say they were."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location, but second time eating at a Wing Stop. My first experience was wonderful. This one, not so much. 

My first impression was how loud the place was with only 6 people dining. But wasn't just the diners. The kitchen was loud too and the gal taking my order had the kitchen to her back so I had to keep having the server repeat herself because she spoke so softly and the establishment is so loud (or maybe I hit \"old\" today, or both).

We made our order to go. The wait wasn't overly long: I figured it wasn't like I was driving through Caine's fast food style so I had high hopes that these chicken wings would rock my world! 

I ordered the Hawaiian dipping sauce with my meal, partly because it was low on the hot meter and partly because it sounded like it would be awesome-sauce. 

When I arrived at home, after enduring the wonderful smell teasing my nostrils during the quick drive home, I was disappointed at the presentation of the wings: they appeared over-cooked and the container they were in made them seem small so it felt like I wasn't getting a full serving. 

Well, I dug in to eat and loved the fries (tip, if you can eat their fries fresh, they're amazing). Then I dipped into that Hawaiian sauce I mentioned. My world was rocked alright: the sauce was so hot it burned my tongue and I was shocked at the rubbery texture of the wings. After my eyes quit watering and I was able to take a second bite, this time using ranch dressing (I'll never do Hawaiian again!) I was still just as disappointed, if not more. In addition to being overcooked and rubbery, they were extremely salty. 

I definitely won't return to this Wing Stop again. Hopefully I'll have a pleasant experience at other locations. I never write off a company as a whole without first trying other locations too. 

PS I Love Caine's more now. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Awful food, truly awful wings. They were dried out and rubbery as if they'd been fried this morning and microwave reheated, and the sauces were overwhelming. I got an order of their french fries last week. They were fried just for me and were very good. These tonight were horrid. No way were they fresh fried. We had wings and fries left and threw them away. We knew if we took them home that they'd never be eaten. Not going to eat here again."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends to get some wings. Of my 6 wings 2 of them were chewy, like gum chewy. I would crack the shell of the wing and deal with a chewy inside, definitely did not eat those pieces of chicken. Fries were ok and service was fine, but the wings were disgusting and I can feel the salmonella sneaking up on me."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I would love for the gm or owner to contact me. I don't think they are aware of how there employees are treating customers."}
{"text":"My first time going to Wingstop. The atmosphere and service was great but you can't eat that. I didn't really like the food but it was my first time going there. You can get the exact same wings ordering Pizza Hut's dinner boxes and you get a lot more food along with the wings. As for me, no more visits but I do hope someone else's visit is tasteful."}
{"text":"After reading an article about Wingstop being better than Buffalo Wild Wings I thought I would give them a try.  Needless to say I was disappointed in my first trip to Wingstop in Gilbert.  I ordered boneless wings and cheese fries.  Both were ordered extra crispy as indicated by a selection on their website.  Estimated time to pick up the order was 20 minutes.  

Upon arriving at Wingstop, it took over 10 minutes just to get to the counter (I was 5 minutes early to pick up my order) so I'll give them a break for that.  Once I got to the register, there was no organization at all to any of the orders, as printouts were spread all over the counter.  I understand being busy, but if you are going to offer a online call in service you should have a system in place to organize all of the orders....at least in my opinion. The girl working the counter was very nice...the only positive to this visit.  My order was repeated back to me as I paid, exactly as I had ordered it.   Twenty minutes later, I finally got my order...that is twenty minutes AFTER they said the order would be ready.

When I got home I found the wings were not boneless and not even close to being \"extra crispy\".  Up next was the cheese fries, again ordered extra crispy.  Again, not even close and the \"aged cheddar cheese\" as advertised on the menu was a warmed up cheese sauce that needed to be poured over the fries.  For those wondering, I live less than five minutes from the location so I don't think everything got \"un-crispy\" on the drive home.  

Definitely not what I expected and not sure if I'll give them another shot."}
{"text":"I love wingstop, plain and simple and today was no exception. I walked in today and was immediately greeted by the most welcoming employees, Luis, Tiffany and Angel. They were attentive, friendly and in a good mood even for the time (930 on a Friday night). I hate to play favorites but Luis was so friendly. I was surprised to hear that he just started so I hope his presence remains at this location.

On a side note, I'm loving the new shirts, they're really fancy."}
{"text":"Wing...STOP. STOP STOP....

I've been a wingstop head pretty much since freshman year in college, As a matter of fact i think 30 of my freshman 40 was from eating at wingstop. Thats a little TMI but needless to say I am a wing expert when it comes to this chain. And when I found out they opened one on the west side near my job i was like a kid in a candy store.

Its on West 106th and Lorain, theres a small very small parking lot on the side, Its actually really easy to miss. Inside is brand spanking new, very clean, very organized and easy to find your way around. Typical \"made to order\" store, you wait in line, read the menu, badabing badaboom.

THIS specific location just opened and i feel like they are on the verge of closing if they keep heading down this path.

For starters, the cashier didnt know much about anything. She was ditzy, kept saying \" uhhhh\" and had to call her coworkers for every other question. So i thought okay maybe shes in training so ill let it slide.

I ordered a wing and fries combo, 8 wings, fries, soda. My wings came drenched in sauce (original hot) which i love, but they werent cooked! i bit the first one and almost vomited . SO i bit into another one, SAME issue. I went to the counter and showed the girl, she said \" oh my bad\" took the package and showed it to the two men behind the counter. The guy came up and explained that he cooked them according to their \"directions\" and if i wanted them done extra i should have asked for \" well done\"..SCUSE you? I want a fully cooked wing, thats not well done, thats DONE according to the FDA standards smh. So i didnt even bother to eat the rest of my 8 wings. I went to my fries, i got them with cheese sauce and was hungry so i was hoping they would be everything...nope. They accidentally seasoned them with cajun and this salt/sugar mixture which made it taste like i was eating a frosted jalapeno...the only thing that was normal was my sprite.

I wont be back to THIS location until they clean their act up. As for wing stop as a franchise they will always hold a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"High quality wings with excellent flavor.  Everything was packaged up nice and tight to keep them hot by the time I got home.  Friendly and professional staff."}
{"text":"I guess it depends who's working but my food is bomb af. The fries are crispy, so are my wings and the cheese sauce is sooooo goey"}
{"text":"I am beyond ecstatic that Wingstop opened nearby!! For any wing-obsessed fans like me, you'll sure love this place :) 

First off, this restaurant looks the same as all the other Wingstops. The inside decor is filled with wooden chairs and tables, with a bunch of aviation decorations and Wingstop logos all around. 

I typically order the 10 piece classic (bone-in) wings with teriyaki and lemon pepper! The order came out suuuuper fast, even with 4-5 guests in front of me! The teriyaki is not your typical teriyaki sauce. It's less sweet and more tangy. The lemon pepper is my all-time favorite! It has the perfect hint of zest without being too overwhelming. Better eat it quickly though because the crunchier, the better! :) I've also tried the hot, garlic pamesan, and atomic flavors before. The hot wings taste like your typical hot wings from any other restaurant. Nothing too special. The garlic parm flavor is a little too oily for my taste, but if you're a garlic lover, I say just try it out! And for the brave ones, try the atomic! I'm usually a huge fan of spicy, but the atomic is just too much! My lips burned like a thousand paper cuts after eating one wing, and I'm pretty sure I suffered from gastritis for the next few days (okay, maybe not THAT dramatic, but ya get the idea)! It's a fun flavor to dare your friends to try :) I also recommend getting a side of their fries! They're lightly salted, crunchy, and just all around amazing!

I'm definitely going to be a frequent customer at this Wingstop. Can't wait to try out their other flavors!! 

By the way, a lot of customers call in for their order, in case you don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"Other than barbeque there is nothing that has caused so many to claim that they are the best as with chicken wings. I can not resist a good chicken wing and this place does a great job of making some of the best. With tons of flavors to choose from you do yourself a disservice by not trying this place if you call yourself a true wing lover. 

Meaty with skin that is crispy, not rubbery like some places ( the streets of new york, domino's) these little birds were made to fly right into my mouth ( yes I know it is the wing not the whole bird lol). I used to go there twice a month to get their bourbon beans,potato wedges, and a monster variety pack of wings when I would go to a friends house for Sunday afternoon football on TV. Everything always tasted so good and there would be nothing left over. The only real problem I have with this place is with the long wait time. 

I mean come on these people are making wings not painting the Mona Lisa! LOL seriously 20 minutes for 12 little wings? Not cool! Now I know things take time to cook but with a fryer at 350 it should take no more than a few minutes to  get my order ready to go. To save time I now call in my order and by the time I pull in everything is ready to go. Problem solved . Now let's eat! Who has the blue cheese? LOL"}
{"text":"I love Wingstop!  Garlic Parm and Lemon Pepper are soo good.  I like these better than Buffalo Wild Wings as well.  The way they are prepared are always consistent.  Good crunch and flavor and made fresh.  These wings are made when you order-soggy wings are no good.  Other locations around the valley.  Their seasoned fries are pretty good too--somewhat sweet."}
{"text":"I used to think so highly of this location until today. It wasn't even busy and my boyfriend and I sat for an hour waiting for our food that never came. We did not order \"to go.\" The people who ordered before us already ate and left. We were trying to be polite but I asked where my food was only to be told \"Oh we are so sorry.\" Sorry? If Steve was still there this wouldn't have happened. Management now is a joke! I've been coming here for the past few years but never again. It seems like this joint is being run by a bunch of careless and unprofessional teenagers now. I just asked for a refund and they offered to give me my food free which magically showed up all of a sudden. I told them we will eat somewhere else. Never again. Screw this location."}
{"text":"As most people have noted, the food isn't the problem (most of the time) This location is by far the worst in the city. Never clean, which doesn't surprise me as there are ZERO trash bins in the entire location. The service is hit or miss, depending on the day. the worst part of this locations experience is the owner/manager. He's extremely rude, constantly cussing, and annoying. especially if you're dining in. just get your food to go and save yourself the trouble."}
{"text":"It's a mad house in here. All the employees are running around like crazy and no one knows what's going on. The female manager seemed to be the most unhappy with her customers. This location is by far the most incompetent staff I've seen. The wait time and staff is not worth it."}
{"text":"I LOVE wingstop and like to treat myself to some just once in a blue moon because of all the calories. I have never had a bad experience with Wingstop until I went here. 
I always order my wings and fries well done and so when I went in for my pickup I tried my fries to make sure they were crispy. Well they were not and they were cold. 
When I told  the worker who took my order named Jessica she insisted that they were well done and had attitude. She offered to drop them back in the fryer but that she wouldn't be able to do it after that because they'll burn. FINE. 
Well I realized that she didn't throw away the fry i had taken a bite of and dropped it in with the rest of them.(which is pretty gross) Why not just give me new fries made right? 
Then another girl was watching my fries and when she took them out she seasoned them AGAIN. Long story short my fries were disgustingly salty all because they messed up my order and didn't make them well done and didn't want to give me new ones. So finally I get back to work and realize my wings still had a little pink in them and were also not made crispy. It upset me that I had to throw away most of my food. Especially since it's something I don't get to splurge on very often! 
Needless to say I will never come back to this location!! Very poor customer service, and VERY poorly made food."}
{"text":"Suprisingly good, all around. The beer is cheap ($1-$2 bottle specials, $3.50 full-fare bottles) and the wings are certifiably jumbo. The wings *were* slightly over-fried, though, which dried out the wing a bit. They were also slightly over-sauced, so those watching their sugar intake may want to ask for 'light sauce'? Sauces are quality - on par with Buffalo Wild Wings - albeit a smaller sauce palette to choose from.

Carrots & Celery (0.99) are a fairly generous portion, and come out cold, fresh and carefully cut - about 12 big sticks. One Blue Cheese cup (0.89) is enough for two orders of Carrots & Celery. Makes you feel better about mowing down a dozen Mango Habanero wings. 

On a related note: Have you ever noticed how crappy the carrots & celery are at Buffalo Wild Wings? Everytime at BWW, no matter where in the country, the carrots are cracked and old, and the celery is brown and dirty. Seriously Grade C vegetable purveying - so weird!

Back to Wingstop: They've got free WiFi that's faster-than-you-think. I worked for an hour on my laptop at the bar and had front-row view of 3 different DirecTV screens. They've got the full $160/month DirecTV package going on here so that's awesome. There are a lot of TVs in this store. This would be the perfect secret SuperBowl party spot. (don't tell anyone!)

Music was cool - a mix of hip-hop and old-school soul and R&B. A pleasant family environment. Ahh, the power of the chain restaurant rings loud and clear here. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Very courtesy and friendly staff that walks around and checks on customers and offer to refill your fountain drink.  By far one of the best service I have received at a Wingstop location.  They also have a huge dining area compared to the many other Wingstops.  Keep up the good work.  5- star!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my son to eat and watch the Superbowl. I chose this place because I knew it would cost more to eat on the strip and we are cash strapped. I said \"Great, they must be dropping fresh hot  food\". We got our order and it was cold wings swimming in a LOT OF SAUCE. They gave us some old wings they were probably going to throw away and just barried them in sauce thinking we would not notice. Maybe we \"LOOKED\" like we didn't deserve a hot fresh meal. To those cooks who made this terrible meal, remember, Vegas has a thousand plus resturants. We have a lot more options here. The way to be successful with all this competition is to do everything in your power to keep the customer coming back. I wont be back. My son was hungrey and he is one of those kids that usually clear his plate. He didn't even finish his wings and that was a for sure sign I was not the only one who notice that i was served yesterdays old dried up wings camoflauged and barried in sauce."}
{"text":"The wings always fill me up. Me and my boyfriend get the 15 piece with lemon pepper and hickory bbq. Sometimes they give the food to you or sometimes they just call your name to get your order."}
{"text":"I order online & it couldn't have been easier!! Quick, Easy & Fast Delivery!! Driver's name was Scottie, he was great....."}
{"text":"I like wings, so I had to check out the new place.  Honestly, there is another place on the other side of East Carson called Wing's Over Pittsburgh and it is better.  Not that Wings Over Pittsburgh is above the fast food level wings quality, but it is slightly above Wing Stops wings.  They both have the same exact air plane theme, but Wings Over Pittsburgh was here initially.  I do think it is in poor taste when people copy another person's idea in order to reap some financial benefit.  If you are going to go and copy someone's business plan to a T, the copy should be better in some way, i.e. - price, quality, quantity.  I would rather go to Buffalo Wild Wings to tell the very honest truth, but if you are in a pinch and in the south side of Pittsburgh I would pick Wings Over Pittsburgh any day of the week."}
{"text":"This wing stop is a Wing Stop SPORT. It has a large amount of HD TVs and a full bar. It was a great place to stop and watch the game, but it seemed like it was poorly managed. One of the soda machine  was broken, the bathroom did not have soap dispensers, but instead it had a cup of liquid soap to use. They also didn't have any napkins, just rolls of paper towels for you to rip off of.  The prices are fair and the chicken fingers were very good, but the fries were extremely salty. They also gave me the wrong number and almost threw my good away because they couldn't find me and the number they assigned to me... This place is great for some wings, but could've definitely used a little improvement on management and staffing."}
{"text":"First time here but I ordered chicken fingers. The girl told me it would be twelve to fifteen minutes. I went n next door to shop. I was back in less then ten minutes but waited for a total of fifteen. I'm guessing they refried the chicken because it was hot but extremely dry and the fries were cold. Might've been good if it was fresh but very disappointed especially considering they aren't exactly cheap for chicken fingers. I had a feeling they were already done after I returning from shopping but because they were done before the girl told me, they had to reheat and i knew when people that ordered behind me got there's right as I returned. Could've easily made another batch instead of trying to pawn off a cheap remake. Won't be back."}
{"text":"From the first visit here, staff are welcoming and service as always is great! Wings are cooked as uno as it gets! Fries are the best as well.  Found me the best WINGSTOP!!! :)"}
{"text":"For the Super Bowl we ordered wings for 5:45. They were still giving out 4 o'clock orders. You would think on a game day, especially the Super Bowl, they would be more prepared..."}
{"text":"Well I was happy until I sat my order down in my truck on the console  and the bag was so grease soaked that all the greased wings and fries end up all over my front seat when the bag tore open from all the grease. Now my truck needs a detail and I still have nothing to eat. I will not be back. And yes I picked it up from their counter and made sure I did not turn it side ways. They just toss it in the bag here you go a bag of grease."}
{"text":"So.....you need to be on the cashier about deals. Ask and make sure you are getting what is advertised. I ordered the 25 boneless wings and 4 dipping sauces for $15.99 that was being advertised on the radio. With tax it's $17.29. So when done ordering with the 4 kinds of wings the cashier rings it up at $19 and change. Uh no! And I said how did it go from $17.29 to over $19??? She then corrected it. Soo as I said.... be vigilant with their pricing. This is my first time ever eating from here. Wings and sauces were amazing!! Would have gotten 4 stars had first impressions been way better. Oh and they girl gave me the wrong sauces as well. I always check my orders before I leave and sure enough... not correct. The girl who gave me the correct sauces was really nice though. The same cashier who rung me up still had an attitude."}
{"text":"Don't even bother to choose this location on a busy holiday like New Year's Eve!

Placed an order around 1pm for a 6:30pm pickup. Arrived there shortly after then and found that they HAD NOT EVEN STARTED MY ORDER.

To make matters worse, 30 minutes later they STILL hadn't started cooking my order!

However they found time to cook lots of orders for customers that arrived after I did. 

Last time I TRY to use this location!"}
{"text":"We traveled 40 minutes to this restaurants location for the twisters. Not sure if that's what they used to be called, they were the homemade potato chip things with cheese on em. So freaking good. Anyways, we went there for that and chicken. They took it off the menu! Then the worker didn't even offer or couldn't make our fries the same way. What the heck is going on. We can't have cheese with fries now? Not sure if it's this location or what. Sucks so bad, service is horrible, price is high, menu is crap now. Sorry, bring back the twisters and a decent staff. Maybe we will then try again."}
{"text":"Great wings! The lemon pepper is awesome! I wish I could have this place in my house!! Staff is Kool and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the wings are perfect the employees are nice , wings are made exactly the way we like. The lemon pepper is my fave"}
{"text":"I like the garlic Parmesan chicken tenders and the coke machine with all the flavors. They are real friendly as far as service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Called in my order for the6pc/2flav, fries & drink. I specifically asked for thr chicken to be \"hard Fried\" I was tild No problem, itll be 18mins. Now mind you this it the wnd opportinity ive give. this place.  I pay the $10.23 get home and the chicken is almost raw, fat pcs NOT hard fried at all. It was disgusting.

M6 thing us this, if you dont/cant hard fry,then jusy SAY that. iwasmad, this time im going to complain.

NASTY"}
{"text":"Have been 2x's. The First time, they got my order right! I wanted Extra Crispy/Hard Fried. I had the Lemon Pepper, Teriyaki and BBQ. Yum....Now, the 2nd time. I thought I was ordering the same thing...he didn't seem to understand what I was asking for. I didn't want the meal, I only wanted the chicken.  When they rang it up, it was the meal...I was confused...but, was like...OK. They advised it would be about a 20mins wait, since I wanted hard fry. I come back get my food. Get home and realize, they forgot my soda, the chicken WASN'T hard fried, like I requested. I was already home, so didn't want to drive back to get the drink and complain. Hmmmm I'll still GI back, as its close to my house. I just won't order from dude again. I'll wait for one of the ladies lol...That's, WHY I gave 3 Stars..."}
{"text":"This Wing Stop seems like it is trying to be a Buffalo Wild Wings and is failing. Dont get me wrong; I usually love the wings from Wing Stop and its a toss up on which I would like to eat at. I have eaten at several of the Wing Stop locations and have liked them all. Until this one... Service was o.k. They seemed a little slow but it is a lot bigger than their normal store fronts so I will give them that. But my gripe is the wings were nasty. We ordered three different flavors. Medium, hawaiian barbeque and atomic (which are our normal favorites) but they were all blah and seemed to have a ketchupy flavor to them. Hardly any seasoning at all. I really wanted to like this place as I knew my husband would love to continue coming here but neither of us liked the wings and will not be back. At least not to this location."}
{"text":"Went there a few days ago and my lemon pepper wings and fries and potato salad was pretty good. This is the best one I've been too so far in Nevada. Staff was really nice and knew how to work and keep a conversation while I was waiting on my food . I'll be coming back on my cheat days. The food did take about 25-30 mins on just 10 wings and fries so they could speed it up just a little."}
{"text":"Idk if this is a third party wing stop or doesn't have a manager in charge. When I came in there was no where to sit because literally every table had massive amount of trash on them. Very poor look for a restaurant/retail food environment. Unfortunately the food also took 35 minutes to come out and I was on my lunch break. Couldn't even finish half because I had to head back to work. Very poor workmanship here. I did notice the hiring sign on the front window which is good news because they either need help or a new staff."}
{"text":"When I arrived I was a little skeptical because of the reviews I read but I was pleasantly surprised and very much impressed with the courteous staff and cleanliness of the restaurant. I order the meal for 2 parmesan chicken and fries and everything was made to order and hot fresh and delicious!!!!! Jeqwuan was extremely knowledgeable of product and presented top notch customer service. Highly recommend you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wings here are good, but service is terrible. Slow at getting your food and unhappy staff. The wings aren't good enough for me to deal with bad service."}
{"text":"There is always a good 20 min wait every time I come to this location. On the plus side I guess you know it's fresh but 20 mins takes the fast out of fast food! The staff is usually very nice but they've messed up my order more than once giving me regular chicken wings instead of boneless. The sauces are ok. Even their hottest isn't very hot though. After mild it seems like all the other sauces have the same mediocre hotness.. Even atomic. On a plus side, Mondays and Tuesdays are 50 cent wing day.. All in all it's good late night hangover food but nothing to write home (Err yelp) about. ;)"}
{"text":"The boneless wings were crispy and a good size. We ordered a split of lemon pepper and garlic Parmesan. Not as flavorful as I would have thought, And these are dry, guess I should have asked because I do not like dry rub. Service was fast and pleasant, prices reasonably."}
{"text":"Many times at Wingstop but first time at this location. 

I ordered the eight piece lunch special which comes with wing, fries, dipping sauce (ranch or bleu cheese) and a medium drink. Leftover wings baby. Wings took the standard 14 minutes. The fries at Wingstop are always a crapshoot: sometimes they're fresh and sometimes limp. This time: fresh, hot, skin on fries with just the right amount of seasoned salt. 

The wings were spot on: big, hot, juicy and loaded with sauce/rub. I got four Hot and four Cajun. I recommend both, along with Louisiana Rub. 

I have always recommended Wingstop over the years and I add this location to the list. Service was friendly, snappy and professional. Any time you are in the Tempe Marketplace area, drive West one mile and try Wingstop. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Favorite place to go to if in the mood for some good quick wings! Staff was super friendly  but I feel semi awkward when you're done ...there is no trash cans around and you leave your  trash on the table for staff to clean.  Other then the trash thing totally love this place.  Happy to know there's one by my house! I usually go to the one off rainbow by my friends. Looks like we have another one to go to now for when we hang out and want wings."}
{"text":"This Wingstop was a-ight. Not sure I'm clambering to come back though. 

So recently I wandered into this Wingstop due to the fact that the In-N-Out was so crowed, the drive thru line almost reached the main street. It's worth noting, I did warn people about that in my In-N-Out (Tempe) review, but apparently I'm no good at following my own advice. 

Anyway, as I parked my car and began to walk towards the entrance, I noticed an employee (who appeared to be on break) get up from the front patio and open the door for me. Nice gesture, I just hate feeling like I'm ending someone's break. He came around the counter and asked to take my order. I wasn't ready. I asked about the flavors of their boneless wings and he replied \"I don't get what you're asking\". 

Ok. 

Let's try this again. Do you have boneless wings, and if so, do they come in honey BBQ? 

\"Yes\". 

Ok, we're making progress. 

So I order a 10-piece boneless, with fries and a drink. They don't allow you to fill up your own drink, which I found a bit strange. Then they told me my food would be out in 15 minutes. I was under the impression this was a fast food joint, but apparently I'm wrong. So the food eventually comes out and it all looks good. While I'm eating though, I can hear the two employees arguing about something in the background while I'm trying to watch the TV. 

After that, two more customers came in and were unhappy about orders they placed online because their food apparently wasn't ready for pick up. I get the impression that they thought that the food would be ready, but it wasn't. It doesn't help that the two employees there were nearly alone (besides myself) without much business. It looks like they weren't doing much of anything and perhaps the walk-in folks picked up on that. I'm not sure. 

Anyway, in the end this was a decent lunch. A tad pricier than I like to pay if I'm by myself, but good nonetheless. I could've had a better experience with more friendlier and competent folks working there. And I could've done without the arguing going on in back (that I could hear). I don't know. This Wingstop was decent, it really was. But I'm just not sure that I would actually come back."}
{"text":"Terrible service.. I called to place an order n i was told itd be ready in 18 min i got there 20 after n on top of that i waited another 35 mins to get my order... The manager didnt process my order right even though i paid for it as soon as i got there... Than 45 min later she apologize n gave me my food, fries and wings were cold by the time i got home..."}
{"text":"I love Chicken Wings! Wing stop has the best chicken wings in size. Smaller wings to me are better than big giant wings that make you think.....hhhhmmmmm?? Wings with Steroids?

I additionally love that  Wing Stop has different flavors, although I tend to stick with the normal plain extra crispy wings with Hot Sauce on the side. My favorite thing to do as if I was making love in a very non-sexual way, but metaphorically speaking of my passion in the love of wings...is when dipping the wings in the hot sauce, then blue cheese dressing, soon after flying the wing into my mouth with every scrumptious tasteful bite and eating every meat, skin and cartilage leaving the bone spotless as if it has been hand washed with Palmolive! So orgasmic!! 

Snap! Back to earth.....the only downfall is that wings can get pricey especially when I can eat as much as Man VS. Food and devour 30 wings with no problem!! 

My only wish is that they should have special prices on the wings weekly. Nevertheless, I cannot help but to occasionally visit Wing Stop to satisfy my wing cravings!"}
{"text":"I used to swear by Buffalo Wild Wings, until my girlfriend introduced me to Wing Stop.  While they might have less of a selection when it comes to flavors of wings don't hold that against them.  The Wings are awesome, I have tried BWW a few times since eating at Wing stop and they just don't compare."}
{"text":"Best wingstop I've ever been to. All of the staff is extremely nice and the store manager is one of the coolest guys I know. He treats every customer like family and if you ever have any problems with anything he will take care of it without hesitation. And of course the food is always great at this location."}
{"text":"I'm in wings and fries heaven whenever I go to Wingstop. Seriously, nobody even comes close to doing wings and fries as good as these guys! The fries are legendarily delicious because it's rumored they cut the each day and then soak them in cold water for a few hours before pre-cooking them and then they cook the fries just a little to lock in the moisture. Then after cooking the fries are sprinkled with a special seasoning that makes your mouth sing!"}
{"text":"Wingstop is returning to the Champaign-Urbana area.  The new restaurant is under construction right next to the new Hollywood Liquor store and the new Jet's Pizza.  The fries at Wingstop are the very best I have ever had.  Welcome back Wingstop, we missed you."}
{"text":"You can't really mess up wings (unless, of course, you don't completely cook them and I eat them and suffer from food poisoning). Wing Stop consistently has great garlic parm wings. I tried the atomic flavor today, too and it really wasn't spicy. Actually, it tasted just like BBQ. Not a fan. I'll stick with garlic parm next time.

I'd recommend ordering ahead of time. And I'd definitely recommend picking up some wings before Game of Thrones!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I thought I would return to wingstop. It wasn't as good as I remembered it. The fries were not what I remembered. The blue cheese dip was not as good as I remembered. I asked to get crispy wings and had to wait longer to get them, but were they what I expected? No. I need an alter-ego to stand on my shoulder to remind me to forget about returning to this or any other wingstop ever again."}
{"text":"Another visit to Wingstop. This time I arrived at noon on a Tuesday. There were two other parties of two who were already eating. Some others cam in behind me. 

I placed the same order but it was $0.60 more this time. I got all Original Hot, due to the lack of seasoning on my favorite flavor, Cajun. 

The cashier was a bit inefficient, having to ask me what I wanted, shortly after I just told her. Three times she said it would be 18 mins but it only took eight. Hmm. 

I was pleased with the crispy, saucy wings. Always a good combo. 

The fries were so-so. For eat in, I was surprised that they were somewhat limp. Usually they pamper the dine in customers with freshly fried goods. 

Overall good meal but with a few rough spots."}
{"text":"First time at Wingstop in months. Been Jonesin for good wings but wife doesn't like BBQ very much (I know, right?). She's busy, so Wingstop!

Ordered the 6 PC combo with hot flavor, bleu cheese dip, fries and a drink for $8.50. They arrived in 14 mins, just as promised, hot out if the fryer. 

Wingstop wings are always hot, juicy and crispy-just the way I like them. The fries are awesome if you eat them right away. Don't take fries to go unless you eat them on the way home. They get soggy. 

Okay, I wrote all the above before getting my wings, since Wingstop never disappoints. They disappointed me today. 

The wings were very small with not much meat on them and the fries were soggy right away. I think the cook was getting rid of poor stock on a to-go customer and didn't really care. Too bad. 

I usually recommend Wingstop. Love them over any other wing place, including ATL, Native and any other. Try them but check your to-go order in the store."}
{"text":"Repeat visit, much better service. The wings are never in question, but sometimes you get the high school kid that's all about themselves. 

Tonight the cashier was attentive, engaging, on her game and efficient. What else could you want?

The wings were spot on epic as usual. The fries are often a gamble but tonight they were good. The Bleu cheese dressing is always good, with chunks of cheese throughout. 

All in all, this Wingstop has worked it out right. Thanks!"}
{"text":"First time at this WingStop. Been getting their wings for years at other locations and just discovered this one near work. 

Ordered online and order was right on time. Ordered the eight piece combo with fries and a drink for just under $10. Got original hot and Louisiana Rub. 

The fries were good but, as with all fast food joints, they give you the fryer leftovers so my basket had some loser fries. Too bad. 

The wings were very good. The Original Hot were a bit slight of sauce but not too much. The Rub wings were perfect: crispy, juicy and a good amount of rub on them. 

The counter service was excellent and efficient with a soft up sell on the drink, since I paid at the store. 

Overall, always good wings but fries are a crapshoot when you take them to go."}
{"text":"Ordered online food was delicious. Order a ten piece traditional (five lemon pepper and five hot)..Best wings I've have in Charlotte. 

Close tie with \"Smoke\" Uptown CLT & East Coast Wings near Northlake mall!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I can't quite remember everyone's names but every single employee here was amazing to my girlfriend and myself on Sunday afternoon. So If you worked that day, thank you for being nothing short of amazing. They served you with a smile, joked around, & provided some of the best customer service around. This is definitely going to be our go to Wingstop from now on. From the start of walking in the door to the very end of walking out the door I did not experience a single bad thing what so ever. They can all turn your day around with just a smile. Best spot around"}
{"text":"I'm thoroughly disappointed with my order. UBER DELIVERY food wasn't delivered in a warmer bag (like Uber told me I had to purchase when I inquired about delivering for them. ). Food delivered at room temperature in leaking soaked brown bag. The driver was going to give my co worker. If I had not walked up"}
{"text":"When I called in to place my order the man who answered was so upbeat & energetic. He like sing-singed everything he was saying. All I ever order is a regular fry with a side of ranch so I don't have much to say about the food besides the fact my fries are always fresh, hot, & ready when I arrive. So in essence the 5 stars is because the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I came in here really wanting to like this place. As noted in my review of Wings Express, my love for the chicken wing is strong, and this place does have some qualities that Wings Express lacks (it's open late, it's clean, they sell beer, and it's a whole lot less scary looking), but I was sorely disappointed.

I felt like I got nickled and dimed. Instead of a dozen (the standard unit of measure for chicken wings) for about $6, you get 10. Then you pay a little extra for carrots and celery. Then you pay a little more for ranch or blue cheese dressing. This is wrong. You don't go to a burger joint and buy a hamburger, then pay a little more for the buns and then a little more for ketchup, it's a standard package deal.  

Also, it can't be more than a week or two since this place opened, and the employee at the register was already looking jaded. Who wants to be at a place like that?

It actually tasted pretty good, better than average, but not nearly good enough to choose over Wings Express."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Our first visit we waited over an hour for boneless wings and fries after being quoted 11 minutes. We politely asked about the wait a couple of time,  but we were pushed to the side. The manager,  when she finally appeared, was wonderful.  She personally delivered or hot fresh food,  apologized and explained that our original order had been mistakenly given out as a to go order. She offered a complementary meal on our next visit. Food was delicious! On our next visit, we spent 20 minutes explaining to five employees who we were, and again waited an hour for food.  This time the food was old an cold. Never going back."}
{"text":"The prices, at first glance, look decent but that's just how they pull you in. They nickel and dime you on everything else. What started as a $12 order of 20 wings turned out to be a $19 order. All we ordered was two drinks and two ranches in addition. I ordered the Garlic and Parmesan and my partner ordered the Cajun. His turned out ok, but mine were a wreck. I expected a wing sauce with garlic and parmesan. All I got was my group of wings doused in parmesan and just a light brushing of plain garlic. No sauce whatsoever. When I say soused I mean DOUSED. I had to ask for a little side of plain wing sauce to make them edible, for which they charged me 69 cents! Bottom line is this place was very disappointing when for the same price I could've gone to Little Caesars and bought three pizzas AND an order of wings. Very overrated."}
{"text":"Wingstop is my favorite place to get wings because they also have killer fries that comes with the combo. They have the best French fries that always makes me come back for more. WHY is the French fries so good..its because they have sugar! I love ordering the lemon pepper and garlic parmesan bone in. Bone in is always better because they have more flavor. The restaurant is always clean which is a plus in my books. 

Pro tip: If you are super hungry order a head of time since it always takes around 15 mins to make."}
{"text":"The wings here are good me and my sister ordered 40 wings we had Hawaiian, lemon pepper, mild and bbq 

We will definitely be back for more the staff is friendly

The wait time for an order is 10 to 15 minutes"}
{"text":"Last three times we have ordered from here we have had horrible experiences. We always order the family 50 piece ONLINE, and when we get to the store to pick up, the employees roll their eyes because we don't stand in the line that people are standing in to make and pay for their order. Our bag is always visible on the rack behind them, we always pay online - and they have a sign that says \"Skip the line, order and pay online\". On top of the horrible customer service, the past three times my whole family have gotten sick - lime stomach rolling - your up 6-10 times that night. We usually get the Lemon Pepper & Garlic Parmesan so it is nothing out of the norm for us. We have started asking them to make the wings \"extra crispy\" in case it was a cooking issue, but unfortunately same results.
We love Wing Stop wings, but to pay over $50. to be treated like crap, and then get sick -- is not worth it. I wouldn't eat their wings if they were free. I could understand one time, but at least three times in a row is unacceptable. Hope everyone else has a stronger stomach than we do. We used to never have problems, but ever since some employees left - standards have went downhill.
Looking for a new place to get wings."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great customer service from lauren and steve :) felt so welcomed by them at this location. Both were so knowledgeable about the flavors and combos. The food was great and came out fast. Will for sure go back when they are there!"}
{"text":"Was craving wings and decided to drive a bit to get them.
They are good, but I find the rubs a little too salty. 
Had the Louisiana and Parmesan Garlic.
Ate the Lousiana, not the Parmesan Garlic.
The parmesan cheese smelled like an spoiled dish rag. You all know that smell. 
Stunk my vehicle up all the way home. 
Tossed right in the trash. 
Will NOT be going back.
Does the staff not have any olfactory senses?"}
{"text":"New UPDATE:
I give it five stars. We went late sunday afternoon. They have new wings yey! And they taste great they are bigger than the other wings they use to have. Don't panic because they have the same great taste. The soda pop machine was out and it took ages for staff to come add ice and more soda. 
See that's not a good mix when you serve hot wings people need liquids and fast. But still they get the ol five stars from me. Good food Hot food clean place to eat and fun staff. Upon my last visit they staff was lazy and moody. 
Upon this weekends vsit the staff was much better. I guess they fired all the depressed people with they omg I gatta work and because Im stuck working I will make your life hell...kind of attitudes. 
The cook said to us wow you guys have not been in a while we use to see u all the time. I said yea I don't return when the attitudes suck I wont pay to be treated unkind. He was more than happy to tell me explore the new menu and that the staff were new and he hope I enjoyed my visit and return many more times."}
{"text":"This was crazy and caught me totally off guard.  I took pictures of the food it was not done the fries nor the chicken. How does a cook spend time in the kitchen and produce half done fries and half done chicken?
 Its beyond me. All the staff have a great attitude but on my first wing I thru it up. I bit into the wing chew chew it sprayed everyplace I was like omg this chicken is not done I was trying to spit it into a napkin but I threw up...it was sad. 
The cook came out asked if I was ok. Its like I blinked and the entire staff was at my side patting me in the back asking me if I was ok.
                                  (IT'S SO NICE TO KNOW THEY CARE.)
All I could say was its not done. The COOK said he was sorry he gave me napkins and I drank soda to make myself feel better. I took a wing and pulled it apart and sure enough it was raw on the inside very cold I invited him to have a feel and he was like oh wow I will cook more I was like no need I wont be eating here. But the cheese sticks were great! He told me he was not going to have it any other way so he went into the kitchen and made more chicken & fries. After 20 mins he was back at the table...Once at the table I took a sniff and pulled it apart and it was NOT done. He explained that he never had this issue before. And he was really sorry. He said he just could not explain why his chicken and fries looked done yet was not done. I was like thank you for trying but I'm going home. I looked at the husband and he told me his chicken was not done. I asked him why he ate it? His reply made me so mad. He said he was hungry and not willing to wait on them to cook him more chicken. You would think I don't  feed him at home or something."}
{"text":"I want so badly to give more than 3 stars. This place has so much potential, and I feel that it's bizarre that the one place solely focused on wings, does not have that great of wings. I like their boneless bbq and lemon pepper flavors, but everything else, even their hot, is not that good. 

I only come here at times that I did not bring my lunch to work, and crave wings as wings are one of my favorite dishes. Unfortunately, it's a hit or miss. The customer service is great, and the staff is nice, but unfortunately the food is just not as great as it should be.

I come in today to order a Batch of 8 wings, only to come to find that one of the boneless wings doesn't even count as a wing. If I'm going to pay $12 for an order of wings, (sauce and drink included) I fully expect it to be worth 12. I was really disappointed. Also, they definitely have a reputation of getting orders wrong, or not having orders in the system at all which I have personally witnessed when picking up orders for my coworkers as well.

I feel bad that I am writing this review, but I feel as though it would help give critical feedback for a business that can do so much better. I won't swear off this place, but if you're looking for a restaurant that lives up to its name, don't come here expecting much."}
{"text":"I have always fought for wingstop in the past, this specific location I always told everyone was \"my spot.\" And once upon a time... it was; once upon a time it had outstanding service, cost effective wing combos, and overall just a great experience. Well that didn't last long, shortly after that fairytale they up the prices and hire some new employees with poor people skills, but you know what, I still tolerated it. I would still come by every so often to get my fix (although not as often as before.) Fast forward about 6 months later, new employees with not just bad customer service, but they actually managed to make me depressed ordering my food, my combo took so long to get called it was as if they were shipping them from Tucson... But their biggest sin of all...Almost $11.00 for a 6! Wing combo...really these wings better cure cancer! Goodbye wingstop I will try and remember the good times we shared."}
{"text":"Visited this Wing Stop many times, years ago but moved away. 

I ordered an eight piece combo for $11.88. It always takes 14 mins to cook them. I got half Original Hot (saucy) and half Louisiana Rub, which is a dry rub. 

The fries are always a gamble at WS: sometimes they're just right and sometimes they're limp as a cod fish. Today's fries were okay. Crisp, yet no fry was longer than 1 1/2\". 

My order came out in 33 mins, without a comment regarding the delay. The crew was cutting it up pretty good the whole time so I think it was just a matter of immaturity at this location. 

Probably not any return visits until the crew graduates from kindergarten. 

The icing on the cake: no towels in the restroom. These guys are working hard to take down this franchise. Too bad."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Bad experience overall. I should have known based of location. It doesn't help when you have no soda in the machine."}
{"text":"Before I say anything the food Wingstop sells is amazing. I'll continue to eat it, just not at this location. I normally go to the one on Nellis and Stewart. They never mess my order up and they're really friendly. It wasn't till this month that I started going to this Wingstop location on Maryland parkway. Again food was great however the customer service I experienced had to be the worse I've ever dealt with in my LIFE!!! I placed my order through the app around 8 pm for pick up at 11:15 pm. I get to Wingstop at exactly 11:13 pm hoping for my food that I had order 3 hours ahead of time. I give Arcoiris my name and I let her know that I'm there to pick up an order. She then says \"we don't have anything under your name\" I  tell her I placed it over the app. She then knew what I was talking about and told me that order was scheduled to be picked up at 11:15 to which I said \"fine I'll wait a minute then\" it was then when Arcoiris realized she had fucked up and never placed my order. Even though she had the form right next to the register with a huge note that said place at 11 pm. So now I'm there waiting for my food like an idiot. I didn't get an apology or anything, not even a cup of water. Then once I finally had my food I checked it and  missing 3 rolls so I had to wait another 5 minutes by the time I left Wingstop it was 11:50. I was going to give them a bad review then but I figured I give them a second chance and I did yesterday and same shit horrible service I'm not even going to bother writing about it. All that matters which I find funny is that I learned that Arcoiris the girl who had fucked up my order a week ago is a supervisor!!! So she should of known better the first time. I found out because the girl that rang us up tonight was having issues with our order and had to call her supervisor. Who happened to be her. Anyways never going back here and I don't plan on recommending this place to anyone EVER. If you guys want Wingstop go to any other location."}
{"text":"The dry rubbed Louisiana wings were to die for! The fries had a really good seasoning, I didn't even need ketchup. The lemon pepper (which they are famous for) were decent but paled in comparison to the two items listed above. I think I found my new favorite Wing spot."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ate at Wingstop for my first and last time.

Ordered the Wings Hot and Parmesan/Garlic. Might be the worst wings I've ever eaten. Felt like I was eating McDonalds quality food at a wing place. Food tasted processed... definitely not fresh.

I'm new to the area... will be trying other placed. 

The person serving me though was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Wow can I get some fries with my salt? Ridiculous amount of salt and why do they taste like sugar? So gross. Customer service is absolutely terrible lmao like sorry for coming in and bothering u and disturbing ur day ;)"}
{"text":"Came by this wingstop 4-20 8:30pm my online order came out to 31.46 when I got there to pick up my order the cashier told me \"10 cents left over\" Thats literally all she said after charging my card and having me sign. So yes I was totally confused. She then began to tell me I still owed 10 cents. I asked why? She said it usually happens when people dont have money. I was shocked she said that to me!!! Gave her cash to cover the 10 cents. But at this point I was worried my account maybe had been frozen and I was embarrassed with a line forming behind me. I ordered a large fountain drink and what do you know it went through. So if this isn't something on my end then why am i being accused by the cashier of being broke? Why am I the one who is being embarrassed? For what? Your system is flawed. Clearly. She said this happens to other people too. Sad. Customers being embarrassed on a regular basis. Even if I didn't have money the transaction wouldn't go through period. Its not like a loan where you on get approved for a certain amount ams then owe the rest thats not how debit or credit card transactions work. All this just to get some DRYER then this desert we live in wings."}
{"text":"1.  Just go to East Coast Wings instead 
2. I mentioned my lemon pepper wings were missing. The lady at the register asked if I checked the bag? Like I just assumed the lemon pepper wings were missing. I took a wild guess huh. 
3. My order came with a drink. Well what do you know, I had to ask for a cup
4. I get home and realize they also left out the ranch from both orders

I love WingStop as a franchise, but I will never return there unless they hire better staff."}
{"text":"I love the wings here, they are so much better than buffalo wild wings. I've had the boneless and the regular wings and they are both yummy. The fries and veggies are good too. Mondays and Tuesday are 0.60 boneless wings can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Wings were bomb! I had the garlic Parmesan and Louisiana rub bone in with the seasoned fries. Wings were really big and crispy."}
{"text":"Amazing! The best wings I've had. I don't really care for wings to be wet so I went with the Louisiana Rub and Garlic Parmesan . For the 36 pack with French fries. Super yummy. Everyone was really friendly too."}
{"text":"Went for late dinner 9pm, great customer service, however too much salt! Ordered the Parmesan, Hawaiian, lemon garlic and
Teriyaki. All way too salty! Couldn't continue eating, all I ate was basically the Cole slaw (which was great)!"}
{"text":"Loved from Phoenix to LV. amazing fries and the wings are perfectly cooked with flavors out this world"}
{"text":"I've never had one bad experience here. The wings are made to order and take 15 minutes. I like extra crispy classic wings (bone-in) so mine take like an extra minute. I used to order half original hot wings and half hickory smoked BBQ, but now they have a new flavor \"mango habernero\" which is the best of both worlds! That flavor with their homemade ranch sauce is heaven. Too bad they don't deliver otherwise I would order them every other day ;)"}
{"text":"Enjoy Wingstop, but this location is terrible. Everything was WAY over seasoned and extremely salty. I didn't even eat all of my food"}
{"text":"Finally got around to doing this review. As a matter of fact it's my first one and it's not a good one.

Two days ago I stopped by at this location after work (around 11:20 p.m.) placed my order to go and I figured it might take about 15 minutes since usually bone in take about 12-15 mins to cook.I was in my phone as I waited so I didn't notice how long it had taken until I look at the time. It was not 11:48 -_-. I had to walk over the the cashier to ask how much longer. Sure enough a couple minutes passed and my food was ready. 
I was a bit upset but happy my order was ready so I left. I went home and when I opened my to go container it looked DISGUSTINGLY! It seemed like my wings had been sitting for a while and the sauce was now oily as if it HAD been there for a while. They were cold and not appealing. The fries were cold (I live about a block from there so it wasn't the drive home). By that time they were closed, so I couldn't go back and get it remade. If you stop by here make sure you open each container and make sure they're edible.

Most likely will not go back!"}
{"text":"Omg I love the lemon pepper bone in wings with ranch dressing. At this location they take time to cook your wings well done. Who wants half done chicken? Nobody. Hot & fresh is how they do it here. It's even good if u get it to go. The fries are good with a cup of cheese. Who knew but their hot rolls are devine."}
{"text":"Shitty as can be!!! Went there for Superbowl as PAYING CUSTOMERS and couldn't even watch the Superbowl!!! Corporate. And in and wouldn't allow NO CUSTOMERS to listen to the television!!! Customers even left!!! David was the head honcho and even denied all customers the ability to hear the game!!! I'll never and I mean NEVER will go to a wingstop ever in my life due to \"corporate\" decisions!!! FUCK this place and everything they stand for!!! It's complete negligence towards customers!! Especially when they are PAYING!!!!!!! Thanks for ruining every experience!!!"}
{"text":"Word of warning, don't use the iPhone app!!! 

I ordered on there, waited until the pickup time and when I got there they said they had never received the order. The workers were very apologetic about it however, made my order pretty quickly and even threw in some extra wings for the trouble, so I have nothing to complain about there, just now know not to use the app. As for the food, I enjoyed their boneless wings better than both Wings Over Madison and BWW. They were nicely breaded and they had a great variety of sauces. The seasoning on the fries was also surprisingly delicious, it had some hints of sweetness along with cajun spices. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"The Short:
The best tasting wings in the PHX area hurt by erratic service and lack of culinary diversity. 

Pros:
- Wings, wings, and wings.
- Lots of tasty sauce options.
- Fries that 'bite back' (thanks Dayum).
- Serves beer!
- Open late.
- Amazing boneless wings.

Cons:
- Food quality and choices falls flat after wings and fries. 
- Orders can take fooooooooreeeeevvvvveeeeerrrrrrr!
- Dining area not always clean. 
- For whatever reason, some of the workers hate you. Not me, you. Yes, you in the back. 

Best Item(s):
- Wings (any type)
- Fries (even if you find them in the trashcan or on the floor)

Interesting Fact:
The food here tastes just as good sober or drunk. I prefer drunk to help me deal with some of their workers."}
{"text":"I typically like Wingstop. This was my go to place for wings when I lived out In California. The mobile app makes it super easy and convenient to order and you can usually pick up your order within the time window they note on your order. I'm used to getting some saucy wings and enjoying the delicious kick I get from the mild (yes I'm a weenie, can't take much heat) wings. Yesterday I placed an order for 20 wings - 8 hot wings, 7 mild wings, and 5 lemon pepper. The lemon pepper wings were good; they had the usually seasoning. The mild and hot wings however, well, they were disappointing to say the least. I could taste more oil than flavor. I'm not sure if the staff forgot to add the sauce but the wings were DRY, almost as dry as the lemon pepper wings. My local California location would add a good amount of sauce and the wings were perfect. Im not sure if this is the usual at he Losee location but if it is, PLEASE change it, and quick. No one wants dry crunchy (not in a good way) wings!"}
{"text":"Worst wing stop ever. So I ordered 12 traditional, half garlic Parmesan and half lemon pepper. The lemon pepper was amazing as always, but the garlic Parmesan was another story. When I opened the to go box it looked as if they dumped Parmesan cheese over the wings and that was it. Zero garlic flavor, and the wings were not tossed in the Parmesan. Only the areas that were exposed on top of all the wings had cheese on them. Flavor wise, those half were bland. I'll make sure to never order from this wing stop ever."}
{"text":"So I ordered the 24 piece family meal and they are less than half the size as normal. The call center said to talk to the store and they will be replaced on the next order. Gabrielle and Amanda refused. They said there was nothing wrong except they are to small. I called the call center back and Vanessa refused to transfer me to a manager. Bad service all around."}
{"text":"What the mother...
Messed up my sauces gave me plain wings instead of flavored & then the employee walks around the shop complaining about his job & other customers... cool. 

Bww!"}
{"text":"The flavors were good on the boneless wings but the coating was a little too thick and hard. We ordered mild (which is definitely mild so if you want a kick, you may want to kick it up a notch) and the Louisiana Rub which had a nice flavor. Buns are dipped in butter where is prefer to put my own butter in. Coleslaw and fries were ok, nothing special. Service was friendly. We will be back to try other flavors if we have a wing mood."}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed! I ordered an 8pc with fries it took 20 minutes and the place was empty the lady that ordered behind me had a bigger order and they ended up getting there food first. As i was about to walk through the door the cashier was cleaning the door so i waited a second and she just kept spraying the door and as we began to order i was giving a lot of attitude. I was given the wrong amount of change. When i got home i had a very small amount of fries it wasnt even halfway full."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy Wingstop; however, this location left little reason to comeback. Arrived at 11:11 am with no line. Ordered and was told would take 18 mins. After ordering the line was out the door. 5 minutes after ordering a company came in and placed a 200 wing order. 25 min later everyone who arrived after was starting to get their food. Then when asked where are food was, we were told a 200 wing order came in.? 40 min later our food arrived. So an order of 200 wings that we watched get ordered 5 min after we ordered got precedence.  Their reason they give was horrible and blame it in that we ordered bone-in wings. Will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Well when one has the craving for wings, Wingstop is a good choice. Of all the locations in town I have found the Spring Mt. to be the cleanest and quickest. Seating in this location can be first come first serve at lunch, so look to possibly eat it somewhere else. My favorite flavor is the Lemon Pepper and don't stray much; however, all the advertising as of late on their spicy Korean flavor caught my attention. I should have stayed with the lemon pepper. Spicy Korean was just a mess of flavors that did not blend well. Be prepared to wait no less than 20 minutes for anything you order. All in all a decent place for wings if one is to lazy to look for a non-franchised local joint."}
{"text":"Both rude uneducated little girls one clearly in training that wasnt listening to a word I said attempted to take my order.  I ordered $35 worth of single piece wing orders and she asked if I wanted dressing, I said of course I do it comes with... she says no it doesnt.  So I ask why every other location Ive been to gives it to me no charge... for christ sake its $13 bucks for 12 wings (Really no sauce?)  I asked the girl in training to ask the manager and the other rude little girl picks up  and confirms this is policy and if I wanted ranch it would be .99 cents each.  I said so , you would rather lose $35 order for some dressing she said YES, I said normailly I would ask for a manager but, at that point I felt they would just spit in my food.  I said should I just file a complaint or are you willing to make this right,... she laughed and said \"file the complaint\" and laughed and hung up on me.  I will make it a point going forward because of this poorly hired punk ass little girl that none of my company or friends ever patronizes this company as a whole again.  I spend at least $300 monthly here for my employees and this is the respect Im given... shame on you Wingstop and shame on your 48th st and baseline location.  Curious to see if Wingstop cares enough to respond.  This was at 11:158am 9-7-17 in case you want to check your schedules and pin point who your terrible employees are."}
{"text":"Preordered over the phone, pick up time was set at 4 pm but wasn't ready until 4:30. Waited for an hour and it's super bowl Sunday."}
{"text":"Okay, don't freak out, people...I'm not really a big \"wing\" person. OMG I know, right? This is America; we love wings, pizza, beer, and puppies. But for some reason I just....ugh. I just don't like wings sometimes unless they're boneless (yes, that makes it worse). I'm a fraud.

Anyway...I was actually craving some last night, haha, so I went to Wingstop because Buffalo Wild Wings is too far and I'm lazy. I'll have you know that we got half bone-in, half boneless and I loved both equally. If you're into spice but don't want to die, I recommend the original hot and if you're like me and need to feel that sting in your eyes where you're trying not to cry or that sudden burn on your tongue that makes you feel like you're free-falling, then try the Mango Habanero; it's the second-hottest flavor they have. :)

Aside from the great wings - they have the most amazing fries. What's weird is that I've had the fries before but I don't remember them ever being this good. They were cooked just right, had the perfect amount of seasoning, and - correct me if I'm wrong - I'm pretty sure I tasted sugar. Sugar and salt?! Marry me, Fries.

Last but not least - did you know that the food is BROUGHT to your table rather than you having to go get it yourself when it's ready? We sat outside and I was worried we wouldn't hear when our order was up and suddenly this magical creature came bearing the gifts that were my wings and fries. 

Ugh, the dramatics. I haven't had my coffee."}
{"text":"Waaay overpriced - $17 with tax for 12 wings.  That's about $1.30 per wing.  Do they know it's a college campus?  I remember in the 80's when wings first took off you could get $0.10 wings - has the price of chicken gone up over 1,300% since then?

Really greasy if you get breaded wings since they make the breading extra thick.  I guess it's to fool you into thinking that you got more food.

The place was clean and the service was decent but I won't be heading back."}
{"text":"I have been sitting here for about 35 mins for 10 wings and fries.   I hope the wings are good because the timing to make wings is AWFUL!"}
{"text":"I do like Wing Stop but not as much as Wings. Both have very similar sauces and fries. The only thing that is different are maybe the rolls that you can order from WS. Maybe the people at Wings used to work at WS and took their business plan and made customer service a priority. I have to agree that there is something going on with the customer service but it started about 1.5 years ago when this large loud man identified hisself as the manager. He was very loud and rude and I dare say if it was a more experienced staff that there would be grounds for termination. Management is supposed to be a good example. He led by fear. I'm one to speak my mind so I left and called the owner. I felt like I was on a WWYD segment. Anyway. I personally have not been back, but my family loves this place for wings. Last time we went we were shorted around 1/3 of the order. We were told they couldn't give a refund that night but it would be in the office next time we came. Either this happens a lot or they were trying to get us off the phone. They didn't take our number nor name. I would give them a 4-star on the wings but the 0 on customer service brings them down. Train constantly people. If that loud guy is the one everyone is following, no wonder the service is so horrible."}
{"text":"My favorite wing place finally came back to CU!  I got hooked on these guys when they were in urbana, when they left i had to go to Decatur for these wings, now i'm very pleased to see they are back.

the Original Hot, Cajun, and Garlic Parm wings are all excellent.  the Fresh cut seasoned fries are simply excellent.

This place is a very welcome addition to the CU culinary cuisine"}
{"text":"Good customer service . After I ordered I have to leave coz of my appointment , so I told them to hold the food till I get back and they did .. They actually made me a new one wen I got back  I love their fresh bake rolls"}
{"text":"Came here once before and the food was ok. I live in LA so this place is pretty popular there, so I decided to give them a try. The wings were pretty good. The flavor is not as good as the ones in LA but good when you want some good wings."}
{"text":"They would have got a 5 but seem like every time I call in to place an order I get hung up on they are rude and then when i come in and ask why is it then when I call in I'm being hung up on or being rude to I'm being told because they short handed not understand what that has to do with being hung up on or attitude so I'll stick to my 3 star"}
{"text":"The worst wings I've ever had host Morgan who is the manager on nights horrible store wings we had to take back twice had to call corporate and Texas I mean I would never go there again they need to managers is horrible try to get the Parmesan chicken wings they came back with no Parmesan and try to get the Louisiana rub classic extra seasoning came back the second time no extra seasoning well done so well done you couldn't even eat them the second time horrible horrible horrible"}
{"text":"It's Wingstop. The food is very consistent and it's much better quality than Buffalo Wild Wings. The wings are a good size, the flavors are all pretty good and can actually get pretty spicy if you get atomic. The fries are good. They're never crispy, but they're seasoned well and have pieces of potato skin still on them, which is always a good sign to me. They also have the Coke freestyle machines. Can everybody say peach soda!"}
{"text":"If I can rate it a zero I would.  New in the area and I would never return back to this wing stop.  The food took about 40 minutes and my order was wrong.   Food was cold, fries were soggy and wings were the very small. My kids had to wait another 25 minutes to get there food. We topically don't complaint but this was unacceptable.  Employees would go out and smoke, however would come back and not wash there hands yo handle food.  I would not recommend this wing stop."}
{"text":"Friendly ,, But they are the worst wings I have ever had... And I love wings they are my fav Meal..I bought 10 wings .. Honey BBQ and Teriyaki ,, There was NO sauce on them at all .. Really Nothing  . I felt like  I ordered naked wings.. So I won't go back .. Safeways are better ! HA"}
{"text":"Excellent! Came from Las Vegas to visit my aunt & had to stop by here, first timer and will be coming back for sure. 
I ordered the hot original extra crispy chicken and hickory smoked chicken."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and never left with a good experience. 

The first time, we dinned in and this place was filthy. Didn't seem like anyone took care/payed attention to their lobby area. Tables were sticky and with crumbs and we had to ask someone to bus it for us. 

The second time was a pick up order. When we got home, the chicken was only half cooked and bloody inside. My mom called and asked to speak to a manager and they said they didn't have one in at the moment and that they'll be back three days later so we can call back then. 

This time, I called 30 mins ahead of time and I still had to wait 15 mins when I got there. I don't understand why they would tel someone a time and then not have it ready when they got there. Might as well have ordered there and waited there. 

This place is a no no. I've given it multiple chances because it's the only one near my bf's house but I'll definitely make a drive for better service."}
{"text":"We always get the fam 50 pack and get 35 hot and the 10 lemon pepper and 5 the Louisiana barbecue  or whatever the spicy bbq is and they get our order right everytime!!! And if they dont its no problem to fix it!! If yall want great service def give this place a visit!"}
{"text":"We are here on a family outing and one of the ladies is really rude having one of those days and it felt as if i was annoying her by asking about one of the bundles then when i had gotten the food she called the name and walked to the back mind you its a togo order they put the fries to the side with no box never has wingstop not put stuff in togo  boxes for a TOGO order! They really need to talk with their workers! If they are frustrated or mad thats not on-me  someones who's buying shouldn't be a bother to someone who is Working!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Wingstop locations in multiple states on multiple occasions. They're not known for having the meatiest wings around, but the flavor lineup makes up for it. Usually. Tonight was the 2nd time we've gotten wings at this location, and for the second time we found them to serve the saddest, un-meatiest wings I think I've ever eaten. Very disappointing. Half of them were literally all crunchy skin and no meat. Sadly, we probably won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the this store tonight.  I had a party for the fight, I placed an order for the 75 mix and match at 1p this afternoon for a 6p delivery.  I knew it would be very busy so I thought ahead.  At 6p, the food had not arrived, at 630p the food had not arrived.. I called the Delivery extension (which is a call center for Uber Rush), the pleasant guy said my order was in progress and gave him the Uber driver's info.  I called the Uber driver who proceeded to tell me the store was a mess and she would not be delivering my food.  It took me a couple of hours to finally get someone on the phone at the store since the line was constantly busy.  Which brings me to the best part, after I spoke with someone and explained my 89.00 order never arrived, he then told me my food was never made.  Yup."}
{"text":"Placed an online order girl said she couldn't find our order placed a second order waited another 18 minutes for wings showed the girl at register screenshots with our order number and she said she couldn't find it so sorry for the SECOND TIME and that was all wasn't compensated for anything this is was the second order placed it's now 8:20 just placed my 3rd order let's hope they don't lose our order again"}
{"text":"After sharing my experience on Yelp, Wingstop Business Manager Ms. Tiara reached out to apologize for the stores issues. Ms Tiara makes a world of a difference to large franchise companies like this, she took the time to make sure that I was heard and that I would come back. She sent a post card with a hand written note! Now that's customer service, she is the reason why people come back and patronize a store that may lack. 

Thank you Ms. Tiara, I truly appreciate you."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of wingstop but my last visit was terrible. I normally order from this location 1-2 times a month. Normally it's great. 

On my most recent visit on 2/14. I placed a to-go order online. When my wife went to go pick it up they charged for the 2 person combo when I only order wings fries and ranch.

But anyway got home the fries were literally cold and soggy. Far from the well done fries with the extra seasoning I ordered. The wings were barely warm and tasted they like they fried an hour prior and sat under a warmer. They we're hard and dry. 

Huge let down. I sent an email to this location through wingstop.com on 2/15 but never heard back. Guess they don't care about there customers. I'll be taking my business to the 51st ave location."}
{"text":"Super excited that they finally opened one up closer to my house!
First and foremost, as always, their lemon pepper is the best of any wing place. 
We placed a to-go order on a Sunday around 11a and expected it to be fairly busy with football season under way but were pleasantly surprised that the order was to be ready within 20 minutes. 
We showed up just as they were bagging our order up, the store was clean and had a great atmosphere. 

Good price and good wings. In and out of the store within 5 minutes on football Sunday."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for an Elite event.  

The place is relatively new (3-4 months).  The inside of this place is moderate in size, offering some tables for you to sit at to enjoy your meal.  I would suspect that much of their business will be of the 'to-go' variety.  

The staff here is extremely friendly, prompt, efficient and highly enthusiastic.  You get the impression that they really believe in their brand and in the quality of the food they are making.  It is more than just a job to them.  

The wings here are quite tasty.  All sauces and rubs are made from scratch for each order.  They offer a dozen or so sauces and rubs, each with varying degrees of heat.  The menu board behind the counter lays out the heat index for each time of sauce or rub.  The also offer a number of sides.  I have had the cole slaw, potato salad and the bourbon baked beans.  The baked beans were extremely flavorful.  I could house a whole tub of the baked beans without even thinking about it.  The place does not offer any type of alcoholic beverages, so if you are looking for beers, you will have to get them elsewhere.

If you are on the South Side and looking for some really tasty wings with an extremely friendly staff, you should give the Wing Stop a try."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times and it is one of my favorite places to get chicken wings! This place is never too busy, they always keep it clean, and they have a lot of tvs to watch sports which goes hand in hand with wings! The staff is always very welcoming and it isn't far from my place."}
{"text":"I love Winstop! I usually get the boneless wings, and they are fantasic! I have tried Bw3s and their wings are usually coated in too much batter. Wingstop is just the opposite, with JUST enough breading. The Wingstop staff are very friendly, especially Alice. I eat at Winstop about once a week and I am always satisfied!"}
{"text":"Okay, after a dozen wing nights, I think I've figured it out.

Wingstop has the best chicken tenders in Madison. Made to order, juicy, tender, and tasty. Wings Over Madison has the best boneless wings (I think their sauces are the best) - not great but better than the competition. Buffalo Wild Wings has the best seating (but probably the worst food).

So before winging, ask yourself, do you want to eat some standard wings but are too lazy to chew off the bone? Pick Wings Over Madison. Do you want some juicier premium boneless tenders? Pick Wingstop. Are you drunk at noon and want to sit somewhere with your frarority brosters and watch the game? Pick BWW."}
{"text":"Pros: friendly, clean, easy to read menu, wings were tasty.

Cons: prices were a bit steep for a wing joint, time to cook food

Note: this is my first time to a wing stop so I don't know the 'rules'. Now that I know this place is assembled much like a Papa Johns in terms of wait time (at least 20 minutes) if I go again I'll know that the wait time is a bit long.

The reason 1 less star was that I was told the wait time after I was rung up. I would rather the wait time upfront not after I was charged so I can decide for myself whether or not I wanted to wait.

The other star off was just because of the prices."}
{"text":"I don't care for too many chain places however, when it comes to my niece and nephew, I'd eat fast food for them. Or in this case, Wingstop. 

During my annual trek to Las Vegas to be with family during the holidays last year (last month), the kids chose Wingstop for dinner. So, I place the phone order and I have to repeat myself a few times. I really don't understand why places that take phone orders don't assign someone who has better than average communication skills. This doesn't mean just speaking, but listening too. 

Anyway, I arrive and of course, my order is wrong but I'm told not to worry, because they'll be able to correct it right away. Well, I'm sure you know what that really meant. After a while of waiting, I'm off with the to go order back to eat. 

I'm actually enjoying the smell of the hot sauce in my car on the drive back to the house and for the several days afterwards. Whoever packaged the wings, did a piss poor job. I'm glad it was at least an odor I can live with however, it took a little bit of work to get the stains out of my front passenger seat. 

As for the food - I didn't get sick however, the wings were dry and without sauce, void of flavor. I ordered a forty piece however, the fry order was enough for maybe two people. Same for the veggies. And for the amount of wings and veggies, two little cups of dipping sauce! 

So, the food wasn't disgusting, just not very good. Just didn't care for the service and the lack of taste with the wings. But, at least the niece and nephew were happy."}
{"text":"Employees ignored me when I walked to the door and it took them about a minute for them to acknowledge me and another to help me. Wings were good tho."}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Love their chicken and the staff is so helpful. Absolutely love the Louisiana rub and the hot."}
{"text":"This was probably my least favorite experience at a wing joint. The staff was more into their own private conversations than they were customers. One thing I hate is when employees complain about the job in front of customers, it's so unprofessional. I literally ordered just a 10 piece. Stood close by the register and waited for my order. I watched them prepare my food, but it in its to go box and sit it on that metal rack. I suppose the lady was so consumed in her conversation with another employee that my food was forgotten. Eventually it was \"o you ordered the 10 piece\"...I drive out the way to come to this location since Wingstop is supposed to be the best, but I wasn't thrilled. The chicken was ok but due to the staff I won't be back. Unprofessionalism in the work place is one thing that I can't ignore. There were also people in there sitting down with outside food/beverage..that's just the establishment losing out on money ."}
{"text":"Never been to wing stop until the first time the other day! Me and my friends just finished day 1 of edc and we were tired and hungry! This was right next to our hotel and decided to give it a try. 
First things first was the customer service! She was such a nice girl!! She was very friendly and helped us out a lot. I wish I got her name, but she told me she just moved down her and really wanted to go to edc lol :) 
The food as well was really good, i would go here before Buffalo Wild Wings any day. Unfortunately I live in Henderson which is far from this location, I'm just hoping they are as nice down here as she was up there!"}
{"text":"Won't be back. Way overpriced! At least they were edible. The fries were the worst and tastes like they were fried in old oil."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night about 8pm and I have been up since 2am with food poisoning- nausea,  vomiting, diarrhea,  sweats and dehydration- the whole freaking works! Another review said she got mild food poisoning as well. Certainly won't be returning to this location or any other! We had boneless wings (which I requested be fried hard and extra crispy) in lemon pepper, teriyaki and garlic parm with fries and rolls.  $22 down the drain!!!!! Literally!

**UPDATE** GM called me today and while she was nice she didn't seem to believe that these wings made me sick, even though they were the only thing I ate that night and I felt fine until after I ate them. She didn't even bother to offer me a refund, she offered me a replacement meal. Why would I ever want to eat there again ? I don't even live here! And I told her that! So then she offered the replacement meal to my friends here- how in the hell does that compensate me?! It DOESNT!! I've wrote corporate and asked for a refund. At MINIMUM offer me a partial refund for the 15 wasted wings I threw away because I was scared to touch them! HORRIBLE way to treat customers."}
{"text":"Great location!
Have come a few times so far and always had fantastic service and food."}
{"text":"Well, I see why this place has such bad reviews...
After two visits, I will absolutely not be visiting this location again.
Was treated so horribly by an employee and manager because I told them they got my order wrong that I would never trust them not to spit in my food."}
{"text":"My husband and my girlfriend and I went there for lunch and I had the bar-b-que chicken wings, parmesan french fries and a roll and a large ice tea. Let me tell you the food was beyond delicious. The rolls were so soft and buttery that they melted in my mouth and the chicken wings were tender hot and slathered in bar-b-que sauce that dripped down my fingers and coated my lips. Yum"}
{"text":"I love Wingstop but I don't know about the customer service at this location. 
I put in an order on the Wingstop App for delivery and it went through smooth. I was tracking my order and it finally said it was out for delivery. I didn't know that Wingstop employees don't deliver, they have Uber or DoorDash or Postmates deliver your food to you. So I was expecting my food to be delivered to me around 7:50 but 8:00 rolls around and I was like man, this is taking forever. So I check my tracking and it says my delivery was failed or cancelled and to contact the location I ordered from, which would be this location. The Uber driver never called me to let me know if they had any issue with finding my house, if no one was home, whatever the circumstances are, I was not contacted via a notification from the app or a phone call. So I call the location and a gentleman answered and I tell him what happens and he tells me, \"I can't do anything about it, we use a third party for delivery so we don't control what happens with deliveries, you need to call the regional office.\" Okay wait, the third party you pay to deliver my food didn't do their job correctly but suddenly you have nothing to do with it?? So I tell him I want to talk to a manager and he says he is the manager. So after arguing back and forth I told him to forget it but to remake my order and I'll pick it up. I go in to get my food and he said that he called his regional manager to just wave the delivery fee which was only 2.99.....? Wow thanks. I proceeded to ask if the delivery driver brought my food back to the location to possibly say \"Hey I couldn't deliver this order so here you go, contact the buyer.\" But no. This Uber driver didn't deliver my food AND they got a free dinner. 

I would've been fine if they handled the situation better but saying, \"We don't handle deliveries since we don't do them so you're going to have to call regional to take care of this\" is complete bull. I got emailed to contact the location for any delivery concerns when it sent me my delivery cancellation notice and on the app, it says to contact the store as well. So they might want to train the so call \"manager\" to handle these situations better."}
{"text":"I like this place it's always clean and the employees are very welcoming. I love that they have an outside area where you can eat."}
{"text":"Can we just talk about how bomb the Lemon Pepper seasoning is? Last night was my first time trying Wingstop and I must admit that their chicken is in fact better than Buffalo Wild Wings and Hooters! Yes, do not try and argue with me on this one. I also think that Wingstop is a bit cheaper too! They have great value deals!

Visited this new location with my family on a Friday night around 9 o'clock and it was a bit busy. We wanted our wings, we were willing to wait, no problem. As soon as the cashiers were done taking the other guests orders, one of the employees called my mom and I up to the register to take our order. Since it was my first time, I still needed a second to look at the menu and decide what I want. The cashier, Beth, seemed annoyed by this. We ordered the 24 piece family meal, half bone-in and half boneless. My mom had a few questions about the different flavor sauces offered and she seemed even more annoyed that she was asking questions. There was barely any eye contact made and it was as if she just couldn't wait until we were done placing our order. Anyways, we placed our order and sat down at a table that we were lucky enough to grab. 

We originally placed our order for dine-in, but ended up getting it to-go instead. After waiting for about 15 minutes or so, our meal was given to us in a brown paper bag and you could tell by how hot it was that the food was made fresh. The chicken was great, both bone-in and boneless. It was fried to the point where the crisp remained after being doused in all the sauce. Nobody likes soggy wings, am I right? My favorite was of course the Lemon Pepper. Garlic Parmesan was delicious as well, there was just the right amount of garlic. Hickory Smoked BBQ was nice and sweet! I'm not sure if I'm a complete fan of the fries... They tasted a little sweet. Wingstop's ranch dip is so good! Why can't I ever find that kind of ranch in stores?

Anyways, I probably would've given this location a higher rating had it not been for the employee who took our order because the food was delicious! And I'm not sure if they were understaffed at the time, but there was trash all over the empty tables and a bunch of stray French fries on the floor. Hoping to give this location a few more stars in the future!"}
{"text":"wings are good, fries.. brown and soggy oil soaked..means old, broken down fry oil. Not healthy at all."}
{"text":"Really don't appreciate the crumbs I was given as fries!! And I also specifically asked for no seasoning on my fries.,,, of course they were seasoned ."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!!   We ordered our wings online tonight, which we have done one time before with no issues. We got a family pack with 40 wings and we could pick 4 different flavors.  The family pack came with fries, veggies, and 4 different dipping sauces which we could pick. I received a conformation email that had a pick up time that was 20 minutes away. We waited the whole 20 minutes before we left the house to assure no waiting issues.  My husband got to Wingstop and sure enough the order was not ready. No big deal... Well after another 20 minutes the order was finally ready!!! I'm pretty sure that our order was either forgotten or they didn't realize that they had an order in.  He leaves and arrives home to our hungry family and takes everything out and realize we have 30 wings not the 40! Umm... Yes we are starving and dinner is already running late! We get on the phone and just make some promise to give us 40 free and hang up on my husband who was being friendly and not calling to yell as he's mid sentence explaining that won't solve our problem because it would not feed all of us. He calls back and then tells us to bring EVERYTHING in the order back!!!  At this point we are floored by the lack of customer service. He packs up everything and shows up to wait again (thankfully not as long). They threw out the whole order and they pack up all our wings.  We were informed that even though the online service told us a pickup time, that doesn't apply on a Friday night. Well sorry our crystal ball was broken and we didn't know that the online pickup time is just kidding! The wings finally arrive... Over an hour from when they originally were supposed to be picked up. We thankfully had our wings. However, last mistake we found was all incorrect dipping sauce!!! At this point we said, \"who cares\" and finally filled out tummies!!!  What a nightmare!!!"}
{"text":"It's our go too place for fast and fresh wings,  but they go thru employees quickly,  we never know who we are dealing with, this past time we waited close to 30 minutes for lunch, I felt like I could've have cooked myself in half the time."}
{"text":"Ordered food to-go from here and when I got home the whole order was wrong. Of course it was upsetting, so I called back and they said they would fix it. Went back for the fixed order and the manager was really sorry about it. He took full responsibility and gave us extra wings, fries, and dipping sauce. The manger also offered a free large drink, but with all the extra stuff he gave us, it was enough to be satisfied."}
{"text":"wings place.  good wings, sports on tv.  i like the spicy flavors.  not so much the parmesan ones, they taste a little too funky :)

the staff that works here are pretty good and they will be happy to remind you that you are ordering boneless or with bone combos, just so you won't feel cheated when the bones are missing or are in there :)"}
{"text":"Very rude staff (as is typical with Wing Stop)! The girl at the counter rolled her eyes at me when I asked that my boneless wings be cooked slightly longer (I've received them a little raw before). 
The wings were pretty good as usual, the fries were under-cooked and under-seasoned, pretty limp."}
{"text":"The food is usually great. It's the customer service I have complaints about. We ordered delivery tonight from the Wingstop App. After it arrived and we began eating, we realized half our order was missing. An order of fries, veggie sticks, and two brownies were missing! I first text the driver from the delivery service they used. He said he gave us everything he was given. So I proceed to call Wingstop about the issue. They said they would send the rest of the order back out. A minute later we get a call from Josie saying our options are 1) credit for future use, 2) we can come in for the rest of our order (since they used a third party delivery service they couldn't send another driver), 3) if we wanted a refund for what we didn't receive we would also have to drive there for it (since the transaction was done on the app). 

So a customer who orders delivery from the Wingstop app, doesn't receive half the order and has to either wait until the next time they want Wingstop or drive all the way there for the rest of the order, or even for just a refund. What exactly is the convenience of using the app? In my opinion the manager should have covered the delivery service fee, as it was their mistake, to keep the customer happy. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Although the customer service isn't always the best the food has always been hot & fresh! Have dined in and ordered online for pick up, each time the food has been hot and delish!"}
{"text":"Wingstop is the flagship wing brand in Las Vegas in my opinion! When it comes to getting wings in our area, there are a few options so we originally started out trying a few different places. Wingstop at Trop and Decatur is the first corporate owned stor to open in Vegas and is obviously the most seasoned when it comes to food quality. Because there is a franchisor in Las Vegas, I always make it a point to ask whenever I go if the store I'm visiting is a corporate store or a franchise store. This is what ive gotten:

Trop and Decatur is 5 star!
Rainbow and Srping Mtn is also bomb.
Craig and Simmons is Bomb..
Nellis and Stuart is Bomb..
Maryland and Flamingo is also.. you guessed it. Bomb. 

The thing these all have in common is that they are all Corporate stores. I've had a few bad experiences from poor service to wrong wing type/flavors being brought to the table from the other stores in Vegas because they are franchise stores. Stick to Trop and Decatur and you cant go wrong!!!!"}
{"text":"I am so torn. I very much would give this place a five star rating for the wings alone, but I cannot do that because of the restaurant itself. Please allow me to explain. The manager or owner (I am guessing he was one or both) who rang us up was really not very nice. He rang us up and it was just the two of us and I thought (and so did my friend) that he had said $27 so I asked how that could be correct and instead of simply going over the order with us he became very rude. When I realized I'd heard him wrong and he had instead said $22 I apologized, but he just gave this grin like ya whatever. Then after saying two or three times the order was for here it of course was bagged up like it was to go (not to sound overly paranoid though I do wonder if that was on purpose). And have you ever been to a wings place that didn't have wet naps? I asked the other cashier - a very nice young woman and she said ya I know can you believe it which honestly I could not. If this is some backwards way to save money well give me a break. Plus there was not a single garbage can to throw anything out so we ended up leaving everything on the table when we left only to realize there was a garbage can outside the door. WTF? Now let's get to what was right and I do mean oh so right. The wings are the best I have ever tasted. I got a medium bone in combo and for the two flavors I chose Mango Habanero and Louisiana Rub. Both were excellent. The Mango Habanero had lots of kick, but with the sweetness of the Mango it paired together perfectly. It was the Louisiana Rub though that will have me coming back (though I really think I will find another location because this one just wasn't very well maintained or managed). The Louisiana Rub was beyond exceptional and I haven't been able to stop thinking about them since I ate them a day ago. I also think for the fries, which are also quite good, they need to offer malt vinegar. Of course for a wing's place that doesn't think enough of their customers to offer wet naps I'm guessing the last thing they're going to do is offer malt vinegar. The wings were cooked perfectly. I just wish the fries had been cooked a little longer and that the person who rang us up had a clue about customer service."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my entire experience with South Side WingStop. I ordered using Grubhub which I use on a regular basis without problems. WingStop completely messed up my order and when I called to correct the issue, they simply blamed Grubhub.  I asked for my order to be corrected instead of refunding. They asked if they could call Grubhub and call me back. Not only did they not call me back but also did not answer when I called back.

The wings they did deliver were mediocre at best. I'd rather order from Wings Over Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I had the Louisiana Rub boneless which is supposed to be spicy.  They were ok. I thought they were a little salty than spicy.  The breading was thick and crunchy. I enjoyed that part of the chicken dinner.  

I appreciate the fact that they make all orders fresh to order but why does it always take soo long? All they do is wings albeit they do them well. Why not have an order or two ready to go in a warmer. This might speed up production and wait times.  The wings were finger burning hot temp wise.

I recommend ordering ahead if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Wingstop in Vegas.  This is a sports location which has at least a dozen TV'S,a small bar and seating for about 50+ people.  The beer choices are decent but too many girly ones like ciders. Blah!

Had the mango habenro flavor which were a sauced wing that I enjoyed because of the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  My mouth was burning for a while afterwards. I'm not complaining because I like the extra kick.  Once again the boneless chunks were very crunchy with breading and all white meat chicken breast. I also had the garlic parmesan which were tasty but once again salty at times. I had to use the ranch for dipping on both flavors to balance out the saltiness and the heat from the habenro. 

This location is great for watching football on Sundays with the homies. Plenty of TV'S and reasonable beer prices. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've tried their food at a different location and the food was fine; not great but fine. I decided to wingstop another chance and I regret it. The wings tasted horrible, I couldn't even finish them. The best part of my meal was the Dr Pepper that came with it. I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to picking up wings prior to the Super Bowl, but had no idea I was ordering from the most inept restaurant I have interacted with in sometime. I can't even take the energy to tell the story but here's the worst written, short handed breakdown: a dozen staffers all standing around (some chilling and eating pizza) looking like they had nothing to do at this point in the day, the cat is out bag when an employee tells a new customer that wings weren't going to be ready for an hour (but no one really knew as it turns out the frier was fixed shortly after I left), no one apologized, no one offered any compensation, refunds were hard to come by (seeing as none of the four to six people around the registers knew how to issue one \"what's the code? Which refund do I choose?\" Etc.)...all in all it was a proverbial sh*t show. I know technology malfunctions and things breakdown, but it shouldn't render a business completely useless.  My favorite part was when one of the employees tried to make me feel stupid when I asked if refunds were an option out of this nightmare--Rick Ross should be ashamed to be associated with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love their wings. Might be the best spot in town. I'm convinced! The food is always hot and the service is excellent. I have  no complaints about this joint! The only thing I wish is that they would have bone in wing specials on Monday and Tuesday instead of just boneless."}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten takeout here. Wings & fries are really delicious and I like that they have the soda machine with 100 different sodas. Employees were very nice. 

Only got three stars because the last time I was here, I got really sick. :( I haven't had any food from here since, but I might give it another try sometime."}
{"text":"if you order ahead online don't pay in advance.  I did so earlier today; the order was supposed to be ready in 15 minutes.  Perfect. I had other food to pick up first.  Got to the Chandler location 18 minutes later and the woman at the counter had no clue about my order. \"oh you had an online order.\"  Then traipses over to a machine under the counter, pulls a piece of paper off a machine,  then verbally gives my order to the guy in the kitchen about 3 feet away.  She comes back to the register and I ask her if they are just now starting it. Yes. She didn't hear it.  Really? I had to explain to her that the purpose of having online ordering is so I didn't have to wait 15 minutes after I got here for it.  How long is it going to take?  15 minutes.  I told her forget about it and left. I had other food in the car getting cold.  I am gluten free and there is very few choices in take out and I really wanted some of their wings. But instead I just took the other food to my friends and went without AGAIN because this place hires people who are stupid as a post.  They weren't busy. There was no excuse for this laziness.  Even the guys in the kitchen could have checked for orders every now and then . I drove 5 miles out of my way for wings too.   ERRGGH."}
{"text":"This is probably the best wing stop ive been to in Vegas. The customer service was outstanding. Devontae was great!!! I couldnt tip him enough! The food was hot and so good, they are not skimpy with the sauces AT ALL!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. would recommend to everyone! 10 STARS"}
{"text":"Wow.. Awful. My co-workers and I went for our lunch break. The food is alright..I wouldn't say \"awesome\" by any means. The fries were soggy. My boneless wings were kinda fatty and I felt like over 80% of it was just breading.

 While we were waiting for our food, a girl started cleaning the wall above the fryer WHILE OUR FOOD WAS COOKING!! Disgusting. The amount of skin cells, dust, dirt, and God only knows what particles could have been falling in the fryer WHILE that was happening.. Wow. That should be done AFTER work hours. Then 20-30 minutes later, our food was ready and they messed up which sauce I chose on my wings. I don't do spicy and they gave me mild instead of garlic. They offered to remake them, but since it took so long we didn't have time to wait for them to correct the order. Although the girl was nice about it, and gave me a \"free\" thing next time.. But I doubt I will ever go back and use the voucher."}
{"text":"I ordered extra seasoning and wanted them well done and they came out goey and it had less seasoning then it was originally supposed to have not the first time this happens. I only came back hoping they would get it right and they didn't. Wouldn't recommend coming to this Wingstop"}
{"text":"So apparently TAMEKA said she does not do coupons... she wasn't really nice about expressing that either. I walked right out, you won't be getting my coins with that attitude... however the gentleman behind the counter was very polite he should be in TAMEKA's place clearly...."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best wings around town! Consistently hot, fresh and super delicious! I get the lemon pepper flavor and the parmigian garlic flavor because they are both equally yummy!
Yeah they take a while to cook so be patient... it's not you or bad service they are just super fresh and worth the wait! We are use to microwave meals and this is not one of those places... it's a good idea to order ahead if you don't like waiting. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They have a 20 boneless (so 4 flavors), two fries, two drinks, and two dressings summer special going on right now! The boneless wings are good and very crispy! My thing is it hurts your jaw after a while of chewing. The fries aren't crispy but these are the only fries I'd be okay with not being crispy. I HATE the sugar and salt mix so I get plain and just put salt on. No offense, but sugar with salt on potatoes isn't a good mix at all."}
{"text":"I hate boneless but these were so good today. I tried mild and garlic Parmesan. Garlic is much different than Bdubs parm garlic. Here it's dry rub in a way and at Bdubs it's saucier. It's whatever you're craving. Both are very good. Mild wasn't really mild at all?.. I wouldn't even consider it that. My boyfriend got mango habanero. I cannot have spicy food. It's too much for me. At Bdubs, if I have anything hotter than mild I'll die. Mango is one of the hottest flavored at WS. I was able to eat it just fine. Hell, I think my mild was hotter. Very disappointing. But like I said, hot isn't for me so I'm okay with that. I thought the food was so good! I'm not a fan of the fries though. No fries should have sugar and salt on them lol."}
{"text":"We gave Wing Stop a second chance after the debacle that I wrote about a few months prior. Our experience was quite the opposite. There were new staff members and the place was quiet and empty when we arrived. The cashier was very courteous. Our wings were on time and cooked the best we ever had from this location. This was quite a turnaround from my previous experience and I hope they can keep up with this kind of service on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place one star because you HAVE to give a star. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Carlos is very rude and didn't seem to want customers in the business. The sign that says \"open until midnight\" was off,  music was off, tv's were off, and chairs were stacked on the tables. I mean if it was like a half hour before closing but really an hour and a half before closing? I'm not recommending this place to anyone. This place has lost my business."}
{"text":"What can I say, this is wing lovers heaven.  Never have I experienced the ability to choose from such a diverse selection of chicken wing seasonings.  It is a great spot for wings. It is a bit more upscale than a typical fast food wing joint. And they have prompt service and comfortable seating area.  

It is a great concept and the wings are good. I tried BBQ and the Lemon Pepper and Original.  I was a major fan of the Lemon Pepper."}
{"text":"I stopped in here a few weeks ago for a take out order. My party ordered the lemon pepper as well as the parm boneless wings. The parm was a bit too salty for me but the lemon pepper was delicious. The staff here was friendly and seemed to be having fun. I would return."}
{"text":"This review is for their online ordering service. I placed my order at 4:12 and was quoted a delivery time of 5:00. I call to check on my order at 5:15 and was told the driver just left with my food and that it is busy. Mind you that would put my delivery at over 30 min late. I change my mind and decide to cancel my order as I was getting updates that my food was delivered which was obviously a lie. I call back and ask for a manager, was told there was just the shift leader and she could \"cancel\" my order since it hadn't left yet. Mind you again, they said it DID leave. 10 minutes later the driver calls saying he is lost but is in my complex. I feel bad for him but I would never use the service again."}
{"text":"It's Wingstop. It's \"faster\" food wings with great selections and even better blue cheese. I like this location as it's friendly and clean although I can't say I've been to many bad ones. You can order online which I recommend as the wait can be upwards 30 min at peak times (reason for missing star). My order has always been correct but I did have to wait for it a few times once ordering online. Always a line which is a good thing and they have that 21st century coke machine with all the flavors."}
{"text":"First time visiting any Wing Stop location and I should have picked another location. Ordered food through the app and arrived 5 minutes after the pickup time I received in the email. Food hadn't even been started yet. Cooks were standing around talking and I watched them throw it all together.

After waiting 15 more minutes picked up the food. Wings were average, and sauce was nothing special. French fries at the bottom of the basket were still frozen... All of this for $30 to feed two people.

I can live without Wing Stop in the future."}
{"text":"The best wings ever lemon pepper my favorite with the fried corn the sauces  are the best even to the drinks and the employees there so helpful everyone who reads this go to wingstop in Henderson on mark st the best"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for 16 minutes. Nobody made eye contact or even acknowledged that I was there. Soooo I took my business elsewhere. Screw you guys."}
{"text":"Great specials!!! I love the option of getting a beer instead of soda for a dollar more haha!!! Had to rush and eat but it's a great hang out spot and I will def go again!! I wish I had one closer to me because this will def be an addiction!! Haha"}
{"text":"Super good! Best boneless wings in town. Freshly made and tasty flavor."}
{"text":"This place is good but they are really slow. I thought it was just the last couple times I've been here but it's every time. Expect to wait 15 or 20 minutes at least for your wings. Fries and garlic parm wings are my favorite on the menu."}
{"text":"Ain't no place better than wingstop. Good service. Great wings. Love those fries too."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place brings back some good memories.  A friend and I came in when they first opened back in like '04.  We got some hot wings and some ATOMIC hot wings.  These hot wings were F*ing awesome.  Our lips were burning after only a few bites.  We were laughing and downing water like crazy and had to take half of our order home because we couldn't stand it anymore.  It wasn't just plain old hot, it was peppery and tasty.  Your brain says \"more\" while your mouth is begging for mercy.  Glad to know they're still around.  This place rules!"}
{"text":"FOOD 
Sad sad meal chicken was flavorless and albeit fresh limited saucing made it very bland. 


The SERVICE WAS 10 stars"}
{"text":"Gave it another go and it's a no from me, dawg. Just go down a few more blocks to Rudy's or BW3s."}
{"text":"only gone a few times to the 58th ave and thunderbird location (next to frys) ive always had a great experience i usually get the lemon pepper bone in u  gotta try them! service is always excellent everyones super helpful and friendly. The place is always clean and best part they open til midnight"}
{"text":"While they are consistently decent I feel the prices are high and you look JW more rub options"}
{"text":"Everytime i go to this wingstop everyone is always really friendly and the food is always good ... They messed up my order today giving 2 of the same meals which had the flavors my boyfriend wanted which is waayyy to spicy for me! When i called them and told them they were really apologetic and told me to come back and they would make it over for me. When i told them i was walking (no car) they upgraded it from 8 to a 10 piece for the inconvenience and also gave me another drink when i arrived cause its hot outside! The ladies at this wingstop were really nice...thanks for knowing how to treat your customers the right way!


This is a nice surpirse they gave me fries too!! Yay my old fries were cold!"}
{"text":"Wingstop has my favorite wings, only my wife does it better. I do still sneak and get that cajun dry spice for those times when I have chicken at home. Mild sauce goes great on everything and the garlic parmesan is a close 2nd."}
{"text":"It's Super Bowl Sunday and they have what seems like 100 people working really hard right now. Haven't even gotten my wings yet, just wanted to give props to the employees and management for how they are handling the crowd!"}
{"text":"This place is the fucking bomb! I don't understand what all the negative reviews are for. The staff is super nice and friendly. I have only had one issue since going there and they immediately corrected it and gave me some extra wings for the inconvenience. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"INCOMPETENT PERSONNEL & HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! .I went to the 2777 W. Craig Road location, Ste. 107 in North Las Vegas.  I ordered 24 piece family meal online which came with a side and veges.  Unfortunately, I never received my veges.  When I arrived to pick up my order another customer was complaining  that her food was cold and the young lady behind the counter was rude to that customer.  Wing Stop needs to hire competent people.  When I called to report my missing items the man on the phone said I could come back and pick up my veges.  I would waste more gas just to go and pick it up.  I placed my order around 2 pm which should have given them enough time to get my order right.  My pick up time was at 4 pm.  i won't be going there anymore.

UPDATE:  I just tasted the wings and they are dried out.  This crap cost too much to deal with this!"}
{"text":"Great service and food.  I just got done coaching a little league game and my son and I called in our order. When I arrived I realized that I forgot my wallet and apologized.  The manager, Bobby, was very understanding and let me take the food as I promised to comeback later and pay.  I later paid.  The food was great, but nice to know the manager trusted me.  Great place to eat.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 4 times and its been hit or miss. Let me explain. The 2 times things went wrong was that there was another Roger before me that ordered to go so they mistakenly gave it to me thinkng that it was dine in which I was there for. They should really do something else when it comes to customers with same names. The second time that was a miss was one of the wings still had some feathers sticking out of it! Come on, man! How do you not catch that before throwing it into the fryer and then still not seeing it after putting it in the little containers?

Anyways, what I usually get is the traditional 8 piece bone in combo ($9.99) which comes with fries and a drink. My favorite flavors are Lemon Pepper and Hawaiian. I always tell them I want my wings well done and so should you. That way you are guaranteed it not being undercooked and has a better overall crispiness to it. You can get any one of the sauces as your dipping sauce instead of just the default ranch. I love to get the Mango Habanero sauce and dip my fries in it. The fries are freshly hand cut and still has the skin on them which I love. Their fountain drink machine are one of those that you can make different flavors like cherry lime diet coke. I think its standard now at all Wingstop locations. Hours are everyday from 10:30 am to 12 midnight. So dont be that guy that shows up right before midnight.

Overall, the customer service here needs some serious work.  I know they have been open since October of last year (2015) but I have been coming here since December. The food and service is usually consistent at all the locations that I have been to but it seems that it is a toss up here. These folks need to get it together at this location

{"text":"What an easy process!!  I ordered paid online, picked up the food which was ready when I got there and it was delicious!!  I thought it might be a little crazy since it's a Friday night during March Madness but it was easy, fast and delicious!!  I should've taken a pic before the fam gobbled down but it's gone now!  The only thing that could've made it better was if there was a Wingstop closer.  But this one isn't that far really.  Every time we order the service and food is always great!"}
{"text":"I waited literally over 20 minutes b/c they ran out of receipt paper like how long did it take them to realize it, then they did not once say sorry about it just kept giving out excuses as to why it took so long !"}
{"text":"Love Wingstop! I try to drop by here every time I am in the valley. Killer wings, killer frys, and if Rick Ross owns some of them you know the chicken is good!"}
{"text":"Reggie again turned me on to a great food find.  Wingstop, my friends, definitely has some of the best wings ever.  He recommended the lemon pepper coated wings and we got 6 of the garlic parm since he had never tried them.  The wings are perfectly crispy and the lemon pepper is out of this world.  The flavor is so intense but complements the moist chicken very well.  The garlic parm is just ok though.  You can get several dipping sauces including ranch, blue cheese, hot, mild, and even teriyaki.  The blue cheese was mild and not overpowering and went well with the mild sauce.  The fries are great too!  They almost have a sweet flavor to them.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the dining area is so small.  They do  serve beer too."}
{"text":"So coworker and I decided to have wing stop for lunch let me tell you very convenient to be able to order online pay and have it ready when you get there. We did eat lunch while there and it was pretty tasty. There's no real service it's a wing stop but it was Clean it wasn't crowded and when you did have to interact with staff they were pleasant. We just may have to add this to our lunch go To a list"}
{"text":"We were visiting from California and we stopped by after doing some shopping near by. I always order original hot but back in California I stopped eating at wing stop since they were not putting enough wing sauce. This place was great ! The wings had a lot of sauce and the fried were good."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! IT WILL BE A WASTE OF MONEY & TIME!! I have been a loyal customer to wingstop for years & this is the only location that gives me the worst wings. I forgave them the first time I had bad food & then they did it to me again. My boyfriend & I were so upset that this happened to us twice. They barely put ANY sauce on our wings. I BELIEVE the cooks here are LAZY. This location gives wing stop a bad taste. If this was the first time I ever ate at wing stop it would be my last. Corporate needs to know how horrible their food is here."}
{"text":"Every single time I call for an order they put me on hold for at least 4 to 10 min. I love their wings but their service is horrible   I wish I could say this has only happened once. And I typically call after 8pm for an order. What ever happened to customer service?"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Stopped in after a quick walk up and down Regent St. trying to decide where to eat, and this place looked like it would be affordable and fast. Definitely right! I had ten boneless garlic parmesan wings, and they managed to get the crispy outside to juicy meat ratio down to perfection. It was really garlic and parmesan, unlike places like BWW where Garlic Parmesan is a sauce type. This is genuine, smothered in parmesan cheese and garlic deliciousness. I don't know how good this would be in traditional wing form, and I don't really plan to find out. I've already found a five-star dish there and I intend to return the next time I am craving some crunchy, garlicky, parmesany, greasy, juicy chicken.

Also, they have one of those \"for real it's any way you want it\" drink machines that are amazing."}
{"text":"Great food...good customer service...the only down side is the raise in price...combos went up a dollar since the last time...overall good!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to WingStop that many times before so I didn't expect customer service from a small wing joint. I was pleasantly surprised :) I like that even a fast food chain can have friendly people. My boyfriend walked up to the counter and asked for a box and the guy told him he'd wrap up our stuff for us. So my boyfriend then brought the tray up to the counter and he took our food and brought it back neatly boxed and bagged. I also went up to the counter and was greeted by a nice guy who asked if I needed a refill and filled my cup. It's the little things that make an establishment worthwhile to visit. You just don't have that at McDonald's. Service was a little slow. I personally don't think their wings are anything to rave about, but ill come back soon for sure because I was treated nicely.  Thanks WingStop!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why people hate this place. The wings are delicious and the fries are to die for(Cajun especially). The staff is also always nice to me. I rate this place 4 out of 5 stars, but I'm giving it a 5 to combat the unfair reviews."}
{"text":"I will never go to this location again! 

It was my boyfriend's birthday so I decided to surprise him with his favorite Wing Stop. Because I wanted to get home early I ordered online so I wouldn't have to wait that long.

I waited for about 10 minutes and thought I would grab a bottled IBC root beer. The cashier did not know how to ring it up so he had to call over another staff. I saw them stare at the register and finally rang up a root beer for 3.75. He ws really rude and had no idea what he was doing. 

I guess I have to go to Trop for wings!"}
{"text":"The worst!
I placed an order for an event. Was never made.
No apologized for the inconvenience. To top it off they said if I wanted my order to be made, it would take a while. 
I emailed to WS and no one ever replied."}
{"text":"Was feeinin for some wangs and these guys just happen to be in the vicinity so off we went. I love the fact that their hours are 11 am to midnight everyday.

I usually get the 8 piece traditional meal combo that comes with fries and a drink for around 10 bucks which is a good deal to me. When I say traditional I mean bone in. I have tried the boneless and honestly it just doesnt taste any better than bone in because I think the bone gives the chicken more flavor. Kind of like ribs. If you have ever had boneless ribs you know its just not the same.

Anyways, for the 8 piece you have your choice of two flavors. I usually get the Garlic Parmesan and Lemon Pepper and sometimes the Mesquite Barbeque. This time around they had the Chile Lime wings as a limited time flavor so I got that and Garlic Parmesan.

As usual, they always tell you it takes about 18 minutes for your order to come out regardless if you are the only ones in there. I guess thats a good thing cuz that means they cook it from scratch and not heat up precooked ones! While you're waiting for your order, you can kill time by deciding what flavor drink you want from the technologically advanced Coke machine. Want Diet Coke? How bout different flavors of diet coke like vanilla, raspberry, cherry , or lime. Yes, whatever drink you pick there is different flavors for it. I think even water has different options. This soda machine should be STANDARD in every restaurant. Whoever makes that decision this should be a no brainer.

When they call you up to counter, make sure you grab a long strip of paper towel that is conveniently next to where you pick up your tray. There is also a ketchup pump machine there where you can pump some ketchup into little paper cups to dip your fries in. 

So me and the wifey dig in. With so much greasy goodness, you cant help but think of when the last time you had an appointment with your cardiologist. What is that saying? All in moderation right? Not sure if grease was included in that conversation. Speaking of grease, the fries are good with the skin on them. I wonder why they cant flavor them with the sauces as well? I have another wing joint I go to that has over 60 flavors and they can flavor their fries at your request. My favorite is sweet chili. You dont know what flavored fries are until you try them! Hit me up or just look at my wings list. You're welcome.

Wingstop and Buffalo Wild Wings are tied with 4 stars from me for they are both good. Both will always be in my rotation from time to time.

{"text":"My coworkers and I decided to get a quick bite to eat after work.  I got the 8 pc. boneless, with lemon pepper and Korean spicy. I upgraded my fries for a buck to the Louisiana voodoo fries.  These fries are bit spicy,  but the cheese gives it a good balance.  The cool thing about this place is thou can order beer at the bar.   So you can sit in the 21 and over section or just the regular section. Also the place has a lot of sports memorabilia. All the tvs play ESPN. Your food is brought out to you.  This place had great service!"}
{"text":"Wingstop!!
Love this location, clean and great wings.
I always call ahead, for some reason I am over waiting long periods of time lol it's my old age .  Never the less.. my order was Lemon/Pepper wings.. they came out piping hot!! and flavorful, I did have to ask for more seasoning as I enjoy the lemon pepper flavor. I did appreciate the dipping sauce of blue cheese and the real blue cheese within the dipping sauce. In comparison to wings and things, I did miss the warm soft bread that comes with the order, Wing Stop offers French Fries at an additional price. No,thank you! I am here for the wings! And they were great, cooked crispy and came out hot and ready to eat! Check out Wing Stop, wings are great! No more than $9.00 for my regular order wings and a soda (8) pieces."}
{"text":"My friend and I's cashier had a negative tone when we ordered our wings. She stayed silent the whole time, we were the ones that pretty much initialized and engaged in conversation since she looked as if someone shit on her shoes. Will not come here again, so don't try to convince me to comeback unless you are going to hire better front of the house workers. The cook was nice though."}
{"text":"This place has gone way down hill since the opening. When I first came here food was delicious and customer service was great. Now a couple years later food is not the best. I've been here 3 times in the last few months and the wings are to hard and the taste of the wings taste like old grease. I've given up on  this location if you want good wings go to Mentor. Bye Bye to this location."}
{"text":"Oh my GOD! this place is heaven to me
Love their fries!! not sure what is special but they are so so tasty and good with so ranch you won't hear me till i finish the last fries 
our favorite are the korean BBQ, cajun, mild, hickory BBQ.
for couple $$ you can ask for all flats!
every time we eat there, once we suck the last bone i like to clean up the table for other customer and throw my tray. well you can't do it because is no trash!
the staff does it for you!!!
easy to order on line for pick up
wings wings wings bone in or boneless i want wings"}
{"text":"Called in our order at 12:35 for pick up. They told us it'll be ready in 18 minutes. We arrived at 1:08 & paid for the food. We waited and waited and still no food. We never really had an issue with Wing Stop before. Usually when we call in our order, we arrive & everything is ready to go. 

At 1:24 we asked why we don't have our food yet & it's been almost an hour since it was called in. The lady went in the back and got our food order. Apparently it was sitting there the whole time. WOW. No apologies or anything. 

Didn't give them 1 star because the food never disappoints. Wish I could say the same for the staff today."}
{"text":"Made to order! Perfection. I love the habanero and lemon pepper- to die for. Most wing places dont offer the stule of cooking like wingstop, meaning at other places they are typically undercooked and gross. But not here, oh and the fries mmm mmmmm can i add more seasoning please. MUST TRY"}
{"text":"This place never stops to amaze me. The word of the day is 'perfection' ! Dominique tried to play it off, but they know they do their very best! Although we just met in person, I fell in love. Definitely no CatFish here... hahaha. Sounds like an online dating scene gone oh-so-right! Well it is! I order online, baby. Lawd knows I'm impatient. LOL!"}
{"text":"Order online unless you want to deal with incompetency. Walked in to make an order and wasn't greeted, just stared at by a girl behind the counter. I assumed I should just start ordering, but she interrupted when me and said (clearly annoyed) that she needed a name for the order - as if I'm supposed to already know that. I repeated my simple order over to her THREE times because for whatever reason she couldn't remember that I wanted boneless wings... or she just wasn't paying attention.

I understand that this is not a five star restaurant, but you'd think that the price you pay for these wings could at least result in polite and friendly staff. I'll be ordering online from here on out."}
{"text":"Simple menu that taste great!

Chicken little is all they serve here. Deep fried bone in or bone out Wings along with chicken fingers. You can order them plain or tossed in one of the many sauces they offer. I prefer mine plain then dip them in one of the famous sauces. There are meal deals that you can order or just order the chicken alone. Sides are seasoned fries, bourbon baked beans, potato salad or coleslaw. They sell fresh yeast rolls on the side that melt in your mouth. 

Order for yourself or the whole family different size meal deals based on what you want. You can choose more than one sauce. All food is cook to order. No heat lamps or microwave. Hot, fresh and tasty. 

This location is by far the friendliest location I have been to in the valley. Everyone looks happy to be there and are super friendly to everyone they interact with."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite Wingstop locations in Phoenix. This is a newer Wingstop that is spacious compared to the other location near my home. The staff has been super friendly every visit. They also bring you your food. Same menu as all other locations as well as same great taste. My food has been consistent to the other locations while hot and fresh. Open till midnight this is another great late night find. TV's throughout the venue to keep you entertained while you wait for your food. 

Draft beer at this location."}
{"text":"This Tempe location is right off the freeway in a tiny strip mall filled with places to eat. I decided to dine here as my past experiences at Wingstops throughout the valley have been a pleasure. The moment I walked in the door yesterday I was greeted by a friendly female cashier. I knew exactly what I wanted. The cashier repeated my order to me and asked me if I wanted to upsize my drink. As I sat and waited for my food she kept herself busy by cleaning the resturant. Which the resturant looked spotless. Very clean dining experience. I felt at home as I can appreciate a clean establishment. There were TV's to watch as my freshly made food was frying.

There were two other workers. A male cook and the manager. The manager who that was a male as well was friendly to me and the other patrons who walked in the establishment but a beast to his employees. He made a comment to the male cook asking him to use his brain. Then he even asked him if his father has to hold his hand. I guess the guy was moving slow but it gives him no right to talk down to him. I could not believe how loud the manager was along with unprofessional. The female cashier looked at me in embaressment. I felt bad as this is not the type of culture I am use to seeing at Wingstop. 

Overall the experience was good. My food was perfect along with the customer service I received."}
{"text":"Who said that KFC is the only chicken in town that is finger licking good? I have to say that is not true. The finger sized chicken wings either bone in or bone out are the best finger popping chicken I have ever had. The freshly made never frozen chicken takes a while to cook but is worth the wait. I believe there are 12 different flavors to choose as a wing sauce or seasoning. My favorite is the Lemon Pepper. Taste like home cooked fried chicken with some good ole seasoning. The fries freshly cut from real potatoes are a great partner in crime to the mouth. These tasty skins are packed with seasoning in every bite. 

The Resturant offers meal deals or individual food items for sale. You can purchase party platters for big football days when friends and family come. 

This location has its liquor license so you can purchase ice cold bottles beer besides soda. 

The Resturant has late hours and a big screen TV. Place to take the kiddos too. Plenty of food fun here..."}
{"text":"Yummy! My Chicken was finger licken. My first experience here was fantastic. Walked in to place an order with the friendly staff and waited in the dining area for my food to be prepared to go. The venue was clean and orderly. The TV's were on making it a comfortable waiting place. My food was prepared exactly to the time the cashier stated it would be done. When I got home my chicken was still warm as it was wrapped properly to seal in the great taste. Great first experience  I will have to dine at this location again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. No greetings when you walk in. Waited in front of the register while everyone ignored me then the cashier had the nerve to ask if I was ready.... watched as the next two customers were treated the same way"}
{"text":"I will give them a single star because my call ahead order was ready when I walked in. My satisfaction stopped there. The cashier misquoted the total, she had no clue how to give good customer service and walked away with a line of customers. After several minutes of waiting on a manager I just left. Called the manager Brittney... COMPLETE waste of time. Oh and my fries were barely seasoned. Needless to say I won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Called in my order about 10 minutes ahead of arrival, and they stared my order right away. Got there, paid, and waited about 5-8 minutes for FRESH wings. Drove home and it was still nice and hot. The night staff was friendly and the food was Great! Defiantly will be back."}
{"text":"I understand it is peak dinner delivery hours.

I understand  that a language barrier makes for difficulty in communication. 

Ordered through eat street. Food arrived missing drinks and sauce. The drinks I can forgive. But sauce with wings is a must, especially for my partner in wings. I called and after explaining, this was the response

\"...can you come pick up your sauce and drinks?\"

\"What? No way, that defeats the point of me ordering delivery.\"

\"...I have to talk with my manager.\"

7 minutes of hold and then a dial tone.

Hey man this place sucks, food sucks, school sucks, parents suck, grow your hair out and live in the woods. Goodbye."}
{"text":"I will say that every other time that I have came here I never had a issue but last night at 1130 I made a order of two combos I asked for them to have extra sauce aka (wet) .when i got home the chicken was so hard I couldn't even bite it.I also received almost no sauce on my wings they were so dry !!!! The worst ever an I couldn't go back because they already closed so all an all I went to bed hungry as heck because my chicken was so over cooked an dry !!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Wingstop and the male cashier was very helpful, he explain the menu to me! I appreciate the recommendation of adding the diner rolls to my order. The cashier provided me with a drink while I wait for my order. The wait time was fair considering my order was cooked fresh; it was about 25 minutes. My family enjoyed the meal. I will most definitely order again."}
{"text":"This is by FAR our favorite place to eat wings.. EVER!! Our favorites are the lemon pepper and garlic Parmesan. They are so so so good! They make them fresh and you can taste the quality, and their fries are the best I've ever had! These people know what they are doing when it comes to wings and fries. They are a little pricey, but it is worth the money."}
{"text":"Wings were ok to good. Place was clean, staff nice. Not writing home about it though."}
{"text":"The online order/pickup was fast but the food was expensive and not good. The chicken was extremely dry. 

I figured it might have been a fluke since a friend raves about Wingstop. When that friend was over we ordered again. 

It was probably worse the second time. Rubber chicken, cold fries. Friend even admitted that the food was barely edible.

There are better options in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"I like this place, but for some reason I would much rather go to BWW. I've been here twice so far... its good but didn't impress me THAT much to get 5 stars, more of a 3.5. The bone-in wings was suuuper greasy and not as \"flavorful\" as i expected it to be, but their boneless was a little better. I guess i'll have to go back soon and try more flavors"}
{"text":"I'm giving this location two stars because there is a serious problem with the service. Everytime I visit this location the service is terrible but they hadn't mess up my orders and this is the closest location to my house so I continued to go.

     On my last visit however, I placed an order of two combos, and there was a mess up on one of them. So I brought the issue up to the cashier. She responded with a really bad attitude, as if it were my fault, and acted as if there was nothing so could do about it. So at this point I ask for a supervisor, and she tells me she's the supervisor with even more of an attitude. So I request a refund and after waiting for her to contact who she said was the store manager she refunds my money, finally! She was so rude I didn't even bother to place another order. She obviously wasn't trained in customer service. Their service is a real disservice to the food, which isn't bad at all.

     I went to wingstop for wings, not to waste my time, get a headache, and end up eatting somewhere else!"}
{"text":"close to the strip. 

The guys here are friendly - and even let me try the atomic sauce before i ordered it on my wings."}
{"text":"The review and star rating is really for THIS specific location only.  Unfortunately while I absolutely love Wing Stop's wings, this particular location is always less than great.  We've had overcooked wings, undercooked wings, random extra-long waits, and occasional bad attitude from the staff.  It's the location closest to my house so I keep trying it, but the last time we wanted wings we agreed this wasn't worth the risk and went to Zipp's instead.

So while other locations would get five stars from me, not this one.  Don't judge the whole chain by this rating however.

When I'm in other parts of town I'll certainly continue to go to the other locations.  LOVE their garlic-parmesan with a side dip of the atomic sauce."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent.  The wings are great, service is efficient and predictable.  The variety of foods is limited, it really is just a wing joint, so not a lot more to say.  The unusual varieties like the garlic parmesan are really great.  Love the atomic sauce."}
{"text":"Worst service ever that I experienced at wingstop between California and Arizona. This location is slow, not fully staffed for a Friday night crowd. I placed an order online which was supposed to be ready at 925pm. It's now 935pm and my 30 bone-in  and 12 bone-in wings are still not ready. This is crazy and doesn't make any sense. What is the point to have online orders when the clearly can't keep or honor the agreement. I'm on a time limit to get back to  work.  Another 5 mins has passed and the other still is not ready. WTH...  NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"If you want soggy fries and overly breaded crispy chicken that will chip your teeth, this is the place for you. You couldn't pay me to eat there again. Great place to have a party if you have no taste buds."}
{"text":"Good wings for a good price and a ton of flavor options. I would stay away from the combos since they are all served with a side of fries which is the worst aspect of the restaurant. They put some sort of weird brown sugar type taste which ruins the experience- not to mention the mass amount of grease! All wings are made fresh so it takes about 10 minutes. The service is friendly, you can order by phone and pick it up!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by to satisfy our craving for chicken wings. But we were quite blown away with the great customer service of this place! Jamal, the guy in charge of the dining area, made sure he took care of ALL of our needs and he was very friendly and helpful. He even threw away our trash and got napkins for us!! The whole place itself was exceptional, it was really clean and very spacious and had multiple tvs set to different sports. I will definitely come back again and recommend this place as my go to for great food and good vibes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Wingstop for our first time tonight and boy do we regret it! The wings and fries were horrible and the sauce left a nasty taste on our mouths. We had higher hopes for this place and we are not going back again."}
{"text":"Really?  Super Bowl Sunday and you don't have your act together?  The manager refused to come out of their office, there was no line at all, and even the employees were complaining. I never got my wings that I ordered 2 hours prior.  HORRIBLE service.   They better fix this.  I will be posting on every social network I belong to telling people to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Its a nice place to get late night munchies...its located in Santa Fe casino so if you eat in the food court be prepared to smell smoke. The workers are fast...a little too fast...the guy taking my order kept acting like i was done with my order :-/"}
{"text":"The best! I love wings and was so happy this place came to Crafton! I encountered it one night while picking up a pizza at Dominoes, as soon as I saw it I instantly regretted buying pizza! I've been to Wingstop 4 times since. I've never reviewed a place before, but this place is so good I think I should!

Wings are big, meaty, and crispy. I usually prefer the classic bone-in wings but that's just my personal opinion. Sauces are great, I've tried a few - I'm a fan of spicy stuff so I like that they have so many choices.
Atomic - super super hot, pepper flakes/seeds right on there. If you get these, I'd recommend having one of their dip sauces too to cool it down a little bit, and a lot of water. They're so flavorful and spicy.
Mango Hab - my fave! Sweet and spicy - perfect combination. I get these every time. The sweetness makes them a little more comfortable to eat than the atomic, but they're still quite spicy
Original Hot - self explanatory. It's a pretty good hot sauce but their specialty sauces are so good I probably won't order this one again.
BBQ - also self explanatory, I really liked their BBQ.
Garlic Parm - I've had this a couple times on the boneless, the garlic is almost like a butter that soaks into the breading and then there's yummy parm cheese on top. Big fan of these especially in boneless variety.

Again, haven't tried them all but everything I have has been excellent! Since I'll be back often, I appreciate that the staff is so nice. I don't feel like they'll be annoyed seeing me a couple times a week :) They have always made great suggestions and just all around great customer service.

Finally, one last thing. The fries, I think they put crack on them or something. The sweet seasoning is bomb."}
{"text":"Came here w/ my friends for a late night snack on a Saturday. We ordered 3 types of wings and three sides.  If i was rating based solely on the mediocre food I would give them another star.  What made our dinner memorable was how rudely we were treated by the staff. We waited nearly an hour for our food.  A few minutes into our meal a staff member cleared out the restaurant. Telling us along w/ several other patrons that \"it was time for them to close\".  I told him we just got our food and he responded with \"well you came in late\" .  As a ten year resident of the Southside I am a firm believer in supporting local businesses.  We frequent the establishments on Carson Street often. Although it is a block from our home we will never return to Wingstop.  Urban Tap, Wings over Pittsburgh, and Fatheads all have better wings than Wingstop and service is paramount in comparison."}
{"text":"I will not be going to this Wing Stop again. 

The boneless wings were hard and very over cooked. The fries on the other hand, were soggy and not seasoned even though I requested extra seasoning on them. I was  also charged for a 10 piece wings that we didn't order, but didn't notice until I looked at the receipt. Very dissatisfied with the quality of food here."}
{"text":"Great wings and great service at this location. Smoke 9 is awesome! I really miss the spicy korean. Maybe they will bring it back."}
{"text":"Can go wrong with Wingstop. The food is always good!! There have been about 2 times my order had been messed up, but the staff promptly resolved that for me. The food does take a little long (around 30 min) from the time you order, but it comes out hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I never ate here until last week. I'm picky on the wings, for me they have to have the right sauce and enough meat. Well I came here and ordered the bbq boneless wings and they are bomb! I mean good! The fries are okay too but I think they add sugar on them and that's weird. Other than that it was good. I also tried some of the hawaiian flavor wings but I didn't like them. They kind of tasted like the chinese sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"we ordered the sports pack....pretty good deal. now if only the service was a little better....the \"bartender\" was on her break but managed to go back behind the bar to get herself a beer this was about 10min after we ordered our second pitcher...she finally comes back from her break and tells us there's no more Stella, doesn't ask if we want anything else and about 5min after comes out w the keg to serve us the beer. good, they had the beer we wanted but by now we're done eating all the wings and had to order some more fries. another 10min later we get our \"loaded\" fries...they were loaded alright....with salt and pepper! to top it off she comes to drop them off while she's talking on her cell phone. IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING? we tell her they were supposed to be loaded, she takes them and comes out from the kitchen a minute later w cheese all over our fries. but where's the jalape√±os? I got up, fries in hand and walked to their kitchen, I asked her for jalape√±os and after she looks at me like I'm crazy she hands me some jalape√±os in a container. I didn't even bother to ask for the bacon. no wonder people don't leave tips for them. the service is mediocre and so is the food! should've saved our money and gone to BWW!!!!"}
{"text":"This wing stop sucks. They take way too long to make food and they have horrible customer service. For example on 3/14 I ordered online at 8:36pm trying to avoid wait time.  It said it would take 20mins so we get there 25-30mins later so we wouldn't have to wait we go in, pay for our food and they say it's almost done just give us 5 more mins okay that's fine.  We sit down and the couple behind us order pay sit down  and then when 2 and then 3 people later start receiving there meals I was confused.  So I go up kindly ask the lady at the register who so happens to be the manager at the time how much longer it would be till our food was done, she pulls up a receipt and looks confused and walks away.  So I'm standing up there confused. She then comes back and says someone gave my food away and she apologized and said she was going to call the GM to see what she can do for me,  I again didn't ask for anything I told her I would actually wait for my food to be made but man was that a stupid idea.  Because it was already 9:30pm, Anyway long story short the GM said they would give us 20 free wings when we come in on our next visit all we had to do was come in within 30 days and give my name.  I said thank you even after waiting over an hour on an online order. So 2 weeks later pass we decide to go in for our wings and place an order we give the lady at the register my name and told her what happened she looks threw some reciepts at the register and looks at us like we are lying about this whole story and she said there's nothing she can do because there's no receipt about any complimentary wings.  So she then calls the GM and they said to give us 10 wings because they have to see who the manager was on that day and we would have to come back tomorrow to get the rest because they didn't know about this.  So they asked for my name and number so they can contact me once they figure it out.  They never called and it's okay because I would hate to go in there and look stupid again and waste anymore of my time. It would have just been easy to go on the schedule and look at the manager on duty so they can call her instead of me having to come back."}
{"text":"I can't believe they call this place a wing joint. Only go here is you want a thick breaded glorified chicken strips. Horrible wings. The worst wings we ever had."}
{"text":"Ok food, terrible service.  Came in and ordered boneless wings. When the food came out, they were all bone-in. We sent someone to let them know, the worker said sorry I heard bone in, but refused to fix them.  I went up and said I do not eat chicken on the bone and he called me a liar said we ordered wrong and hesitantly remade my order.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"This is a fast and easy place where I can go to lunch. The staff is really friendly and if you order ahead of time you are in and out. I usually take mine to go and eat it at my office. I get the hot boneless wing with fries and a drink and that fills me up. The hot is just the right amount of hot because I enjoy a kick but I don't want to be dying from the kick. The fries are seasoned and they are pretty good too! They have like a sweet taste but it's the right amount of sweet! Really enjoy getting lunch here."}
{"text":"Here is an example of a business that subscribes to the motto \"Do one thing and do it well\". Every time I've eaten at a Wingstop, whether it was lunch with the crew, or today with my oldest son, the wings are pretty solid.

I've enjoyed their boneless wings previously, and those are above average. Wings with the bone in are trickier to master. Otherwise, it's basically a flavored McNugget. But with all due respect, I really enjoy their variety of flavors.

Today's fare includes a 12 piece (bone in) with fries and a couple of drinks. Wings can get pricey, but this was a decent value, and as it turned out, more than enough for the both of us. My son chose the Louisiana Rub and I went for Cajun. Both had great flavor and a nice kick in the face.

One thing I noticed on this visit, when I paid for the check, the cashier announced how long it would take for our order. In other visits, especially on a short lunch hour, this would be helpful information. Sometimes, we've waited upwards of 25 minutes. Good things take time. If you're not in a hurry, these wings are worth the wait.

Everyone has a place that they claim they had the \"best wings ever!\" For me, that place is near Flagstaff, AZ. These are not the best wings I've ever tried, but you can definitely do worse. And you can probably name a few places for that too."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here. My husband and I ordered our food around 11:15 (they close at 12). We got there at 11:30 and had to wait for our food for 10 minutes. (We told them we were dining in) it's 11:40 and this little girl hands us our food in a bag and said have a good night. My husband told her were dining in and she said \"were closed\" he said you guys close at 12 right? I couldn't believe it. She tried to ARGUE. So she goes in the back and has some big guy come and say they close the lobby at 11:45. My husband says you guys close at 12 right? Because that's the time I'm leaving. The guy just walked away. Whole time we were eating we just heard laughs and giggles coming out the kitchen so they would let it be known they were talking about us. Meanwhile, 3 other people were in the restaurant waiting for food. A big black guy came in and ordered at 11:58. They had NO problem with that. Bunch of weirdos and they all need to be flipping signs in front of metro. Smh. We got ready to go and some snotty girl hit my husband in the foot with a broom. We didn't say anything to her. As we were leaving at 12pm my husband said \"You guys have a good night\" and absolutely NO ONE said anything. I just moved to Vegas 3 weeks ago and I will NEVER come back to this Wingstop again. The customer service is horrible and the store was ran by a bunch of snotty kids tonight. Over cooked ass chicken.....

Update: 6 months later. I'm going to add a star old because I've been back a couple times and the food has been good as well as the service. But, my husband ordered lemon pepper wings and there was literally a CUP of oil inside of the food like how disgusting. Who wants to eat some oily a$$ wings? They weren't even lemon pepper anymore!!! Yuck!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for wings and beer don't go here. 


I ordered the 20 Flavor Fix Combo. Too much breading. The mild was oddly sweet, it didn't taste like mild at all. The BBQ flavor was good."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  The prices are outrageous. I use to pay $30 for 50 wings. It has gone up to $41.99. Will not be back. Good wings but not worth the drive or price."}
{"text":"Employees where a little ratchet. But the wings were fantastic the food was hot and on time really enjoyed myself"}
{"text":"I was craving for some chicken wings on the new year day of 2014 and found this wingstop. I drove 7 miles here for my teriyaki wings and the wait was not long because it's not a busy day. After getting home, I was a bit disappointed by the over-fried fries but totally disappointed by the wings: I received 6 chicken drums and 2 mid-joints for my 8-pcs meal, and the drums were ridiculously huge(about twice of the size I normally got in the past: I never ate at Vegas Winstop before). I don't think I will return to this location."}
{"text":"Great food,  made to order, No disappointment here. I was a regular customer of the Wing Stop in Roseville Ca. moved back to Vegas in 2007 and had forgotten about their great wings. Having a craving for some real wings, I typed \"Best Wings \" in Vegas on Yelp and found a local Wing Stop, My wife and I visited the store on Sunday evening and was blown away by the service, quality and taste of the food. Wing Stop is not fast food, if you are in a rush; you will be disappointed, if you want fresh great tasting wings slow down and enjoy!. My doctor may be reading this post, so I won't disclose how many I ate."}
{"text":"I love me some wings. This is the best wing stop in town. The manager is really cool. His name is Steve and he always talks with us and he apparently writing a book about names and it totally names sense!! 

Anyways, I like their boneless wings. Best sauce is lemon pepper or hot. I've never tried the atomic but my friend said her mouth and butt was on fire!! 

Their fries are really great when seasoned well. I've ordered too before and they weren't as good. Not sure if they sat too long or just didn't make them as good that day. Today when I came the food was on point, but the free style side machine was missing flavors and drinks.. Sad Nikki."}
{"text":"I love this place! First had them in CA. They make the wings when you order.  So for a sit down place you'll wait awhile. Order ahead of time. They have the best lemon pepper wings I've ever had at any wing place."}
{"text":"Very unprofessional staff of people working at this location. Manager and cashier were extremely rude and had a bad attitude."}
{"text":"You do have to wait a while for your order but it is reasonably priced and the wings are decent.  I had medium and they were fine. Pretty good for wings, I had no complaints, I want over the moon though.

They have medium on the menu but it isn't listed. The servers are very nice. I wouldn't eat in, it's just not cozy in there. For the most part decent wings."}
{"text":"Great chicken. I get the combo the fries are good but sweet and salty, very different taste but tasty"}
{"text":"First time so wanted to try it out. Briefly put it is wings done fast food style and that is not a good thing IMO.

Place was clean and nice inside although very dead in seating area with no music and TVs with no sound. Odd atmosphere because staff talks endlessly and kitchen is noisy. Need sound in dining room. Badly. 

Combos are decent setup with fries and drink. Nobody told me boneless is only .60/wing on Mondays and I didn't see sign til after I ordered. Probably would of been cheaper that way than combo but I did bone-in anyhow. 

Get 2 flavors with combos. Wings are little over fried IMO. Sauces area simply not flavor full at all. The Hawaiian is almost flavorless and the hickory smoke BBQ left a lot to be desired. Would not order either again. 

To me the prices don't equate to the fast food feel and quality of food. Prices are equal to sit down wing bars with much better food. 

Wings are meaty but tough. Overcooked IMO. 

My biggest complaint by far is there were flies all over the dining room. They need an air door or something to control flies. Its gross. 

You can drive half mile down road to Bootys and actually get service, amazing sauce selection and much better wings for about same price. I have not been to buckeye Bootys location but Surprise one is best wings in Phoenix. I promise I am not affiliated with Bootys at all but just telling you to go there for much better experience."}
{"text":"I want to like their food, but it just isn't good. Worse, regardless of want options you pick, well done, extra seasoning, etc. You get the same food. They shouldn't offer those options if they aren't going to actually make the food how you order it. They ask you if you want these options. It's not like we are just being overly demanding.

Tonight we got two fries, one well done with extra seasoning, one regular. They both came exactly the same. Limp and without any seasoning. I got wings well done too. They weren't crispy at all. My wife got chicken tenders. They tasted off and she feels sick.

Honestly, nothing was really good. I want to like Wingstop, but they are just terrible. This the second time we tried them and the result was the same both times."}
{"text":"If you've been to 1 Wingstop then you've been to them all. That's the good thing about chain restaurants, they are fairly consistent. This particular hub is usually pretty busy because of the mall crowd so if you're doing take out, call or order ahead of time. Haven't had any bad experiences with food nor service."}
{"text":"the chicken fingers swept me away! i never went to wingstop cuz i hate chicken wings, but when forced to go with an associate, I had to admit after eating those fingers, I shall return to try all flavors (except the hot ones)."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, great service and an all around good place to eat. Since they've opened up the larger dining area, we come here quite often (it was just too cramped for dining in before). 

The boneless wings are my favorite by far. There are so many awesome flavors to choose from and the food is always fresh and made to order. The fries are addicting-do they seriously put a salt/sugar mix on them? Never in my life have I had better fries. No joke. And the ranch is amazing. Amazing. 

The manager at this location is a really cool dude who's always friendly and personable and makes you feel like a friend, not just a customer. 

There are only a few Wing Stop locations in town and I live pretty far from here but it's most definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is late review.. but I had a great experienced. I ordered for delivery,  quiet faster than uber eats. The chicken wings taste great and its soft and juicy."}
{"text":"Wing Stop obviously is a chain that sells chicken wings.  Not buffalo wings because I have recently learned that buffaloes do NOT actually have wings.  Nope, not even under all that hair.

This particular Wing Stop is much like the others I have been to, but the staff here was cool and very helpful.

The wings could be a bit bigger, IMO, but at least they are more tasty than wings at *other* places that mock owls.  Without all that breading.
Go for the Atomic...it's mouth-watering!"}
{"text":"So far, this is my favorite place for wings in Pittsburgh. Added bonus, I'm supporting a small business/franchise.  My go-to flavors are Lemon Pepper and Louisiana Rub.  Mmmmmgood! The wings are made to order so they're fresh.   I don't usually order sides, but I've had the fries before.

Customer service is good. Never had an issue with that.  Here's where my problem lies...if you order take out over the phone, you must provide your debit/credit card number over the phone. In other words, you cannot pay cash for carry out orders.  Now this may not be a problem for many, as a lot of people don't carry cash anymore.  Well, I'm about the Dave Ramsey Financial Peace life, so cash is my preferred payment for food expenses.  My guess is they've had some negative experiences with customers not picking up their orders, but I don't know.  

Here are your options when it comes to ordering:
1. Dine in.
2. Order online (using a card) and your food will be ready when you get there or at the time you designate. 
3. Use Grub Hub for delivery.
4. Order at the establishment in order to pay cash. Downside being it may be at least a 25 minute wait. 
5. Call in your order (using a card)."}
{"text":"We ordered to go and mu boyfriend's wings smelled like fish. Idk maybe they didn't change the fryer oil or what. My atomic flavor boneless wings was super salty and our fries were under cooked. Definitely not gonna order take out from this location again! It was alright."}
{"text":"I like this place,not sure why it has 2 stars. It's much cleaner than the others. Also more seating. The wings are always amazing,my fave lemon pepper!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered online and said it would be ready in 15-20mins and so we took our time coming here. When we got here they still weren't ready. Now waiting an additional 30mins for our meal, this is ridiculous. And the place is not busy at all. My husbands in there still waiting. And no food. Two workers and no other customers. Where's our food? I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Staff here is super friendly and always gets my order right! Have never been disappointed which is why i will always return. Great stop for quick lunch break from the office!"}
{"text":"Finally a Wing Stop in Henderson. Close to Galleria Mall and Costco. Friendly staff is greeting customers as they walk in. Large flat screen's every few feet. Will definitely come by more often now that there's a convenient location."}
{"text":"Everything was way too salty!  The fries and the chicken!  With a bone and without.  Even having them fix it a second time, it was still over seasoned with salt.  Manager was friendly and cooked again but even after changing the hot sauce and asking for very light seasoning, it was still overly salted.  Manager offered no reimbursement so we basically aid $20 FOR 2 SODAS!  I will be disputing this charge on my credit card.  It will be worth the hassle to know my money does not support this type of cooking.  It would be good to note, I love salty food, but this was like taking the salt shaker and pouring it into your mouth.  I WILL NEVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I ordered 150 wings online five days in advance. I did not want to pay online because I would have to personally pick them up since I paid with my card.  I will be sending someone else to get them in my place. I called to pay for them but guess what...they wouldn't take a card over the phone. I physically went in the day before I needed to pick them up and they still wouldn't let me pay for it. Apparently, they won't let me pay for it until I pick it up because the \"ticket won't print until the day of the order\". When I asked to cancel the order I was told that I needed to call the next day to cancel it. Do these employees know anything about their job or about customer service? I don't think so. Since they told me I had to call to cancel when the ticket prints, I decided that I'd go head and pick them up anyway as I had already told my team I was buying lunch for them. When I went to pick them up... shocker!!! No wings! Even though I didn't cancel they decided not to make them just in case. Now I'm sitting for another 20 to 30 minutes waiting. I will never ever come to a wing stop again!! Pathetic."}
{"text":"This WAS my absolute favorite wing place. The wings are yummy the tenders are BOSS the fries to die for and that AGED CHEDDAR SAUCE on the side to dip the fries in. oh wait.... they took that away and replaced it with weird yellow nacho cheese.... I don't even want to get my wings here anymore. Getting rid of the aged cheddar was like, having eternity without sun.. I am so saddened.."}
{"text":"While the wings are really good we have a problem with the service every time we go.  We always order the same thing and last time when I asked how they determine how many drums and flats are in an order of 6 wings I was told there were three of each.  When I asked how they divided the \"add five\" the person taking my order said \"I have no idea\".  I asked her to find out and she seemed put out.  I was told there would be 3 flats and two drums and yet when I got the order there were 4 flats and one drum.  I ordered the potato twisters with no seasoning and when we got our order we got the regular french fries.  They remade the potatoes but brought it to us with seasoning so the had to make them again.  I guess third times a charm.  We do like the wings but sometimes it is just not worth the hassle!"}
{"text":"Service sucks. The workers are rude and my food came so slow even though I ordered right after my friend. He got his food and finished it before I even got mine. I had to ask 2 times for my food and the lady just said that it was coming out right now. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. 
It took 20 minutes to get my 6 wings"}
{"text":"Rude employees and the wings are nothing special. TBH I've ordered better wings from KFC. You'd think a place that specializes in wings would do a better job of making them. The worker put my stuff in upside down and when I went to open the carton, since I didn't realize it was upside down, everything spilled onto the floor. What a waste of money. I won't be returning at any time in the future."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Fries were better than the wings but it was overall really good!"}
{"text":"11/13/16They have the worst costumer service... this is the second bad experience I had in this restaurant!! Wile waiting for about 5 min for someone to take my order the phone rings and one of the 3or 4 girls just talking to each other in the back comes and instead of asking me if I needed help she decides to answer the phone and kept me waiting there.... will not recommend this wing stop to no one  I rather tell them to go to the one on 101 spring mtn and rainbow they are the best"}
{"text":"Food is great but the charge for all flat wing and extra seasoning is ridiculous I've never been charged for those things at any other wing stop! My $8 meal came up to $11 absolutely absurd!!!!! Me and my friend ordered at the same time and I received my food and she got hers after 4 people were serves and when it was brought to the attention they debated with me loud in front of other customers about the time frame very poor customer service from CHRIS and the manger on duty."}
{"text":"My wife and I made an order yesterday on 4/20. In order to beat the crowd, we called ahead so we would just have to show up and pay, unfortunately, that's not how it worked out. 
(Despite waiting on hold for 10 min, making a very clear and concise order, and having the correct order repeated back to us.) 

Here is my advise to this location on things they need to clearly improve on:

1.) If there's a holiday or otherwise a day in which you know you will be slammed, please make sure to have your strongest cashiers scheduled to work.

2.) If you do in fact have a weak cashier, it might not be a good idea to have the other cashier hold his line as well to help the slow one. It only holds up both lines. See how that works?

3.)  If you're going to have 2 lines (one for call ahead orders) make sure your cashier pays attention, and makes sure there is no one there for pick up so that the regular line doesn't think pick up customers are cutting the line.

4.) If YOU mess up on an order because your employees are not prepared/ trained correctly, don't catch an attitude with your customers, especially regulars. You actually need customers in order to stay in business.

and finally  

5.) Get a better night manager,the one you have panics under the slightest pressure and then your other staff reflect that.
I know it's just a wing place, but you can do much much better."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. The wings we ordered were over cooked and chewy, haven't been back since. Could of just been a one time occurrence though."}
{"text":"Wtf is going on with the blasting of death core music? It's so loud I can't talk to my partner across the table and it's screaming. My gf said she feeling like she should \"cut her wrists now\"  this music is not welcoming at all. Make me want to leave and not return."}
{"text":"The Food is super Fresh. The cleanliness is excellent. No complaints from Me about this WingStop."}
{"text":"This place has nice decorations but the place feels extremely crowded. 
The tables are small and they aren't cleaned off in a timely manner once the customers leave. 

There is only one soda machine and that makes you have to occasionally wait in a short line. The bathrooms are kept locked and you have to ask the cashiers to unlock it, but when they are busy with taking orders you will either have to wait in a long line or just tuff it out :P. 

I didn't eat here because I felt the place didn't deserve my money, I would only recommend this place on their slow days.

Well, hope this helps you guys and thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Taking forever to get one order, not sure if they are killing the chicken out in the back of the kitchen. Customer service was on point though and they were even willing to change our order last minute."}
{"text":"Contact A&E because I need an Intervention.

My addiction to Wing Stop began gradually.  Those succulent french fries, the spicy and flavorful buffalo sauce, the fresh baked yeast rolls.  I used to go only on big game nights, a nice finger food to bring home.  Slowly though, I the thought of 20 wings and some fries began creeping in on random mondays in class or at work.  I even have the number programmed in my phone for call ahead orders!  My parents have tried to talk to me about this.  You should cook more at home, its healthier and can save you money...blah, blah, blah.  Sometimes I feel the wings love me more.  
 
The low point came this last month when I went on a 30 wing eating binge.  My friend came over and found me in a food induced coma reeking of blue cheese and buffalo sauce having not shaved or showered in 2 days.  He was like you cant go on this way.  And then he found my secret stash in the fridge.  I knew the gig was up.  I agreed that I needed to control my urge for their amazing wings and fries.  

Who am I kidding...I cant do that.  Im in this for the long haul.  Wing Stop and I are linked indelibly.  So mom and dad, friends....put away those notes asking me to get help.  I ain't going to treatment!

PS- The boneless wings are phenomenal too...and only 50 cents a piece on Mondays and Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I had my son and his girlfriend pick us up some food to go when we got it home the boneless wings were hard as a rock three of them were edible the rest no good ...This place is usually my favorite go to for wings ...The ranch is awesome the fries are good but.. it's just not consistent.."}
{"text":"Where are the steriod induced chicken wings when you need em??? The wings are tiny drumettes! I got an order of the original and Louisiana rub along with potatoe salad. Everything was pretty bland and they take foreverto give you your food. I've had better wings at a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost.  I'm so so disappointed spending $17 bucks here. I regretted this purchase so badly.  I got a bunch of boneless wings and did 3 different flavors.  All of them were cooked in old oil and they were all so so so dry and flavorless. I was so annoyed I can't see my self coming back to this place.  Also the fries are sweet and you cannot request them without sugar.  Maybe the regular wings are better but there is not way I'm spending more money and risking it to try this place again..."}
{"text":"I love wingstop and I've never had an issue until I came to this particular store.  My fries were soggy and my wings had no sauce.  If I order the mild sauce, I'm expecting there to be mild sauce on them.  I should not have to specify I want my wings wet.  If I wanted wings with no sauce I would tell you.  I went back the next day and they had to verify my story by calling the manager at home.  This time the fries were great but once again there was no sauce on the wings.  It blew my mind.  If I would have ordered, let's say the teriyaki wings, would I need to specify that I want them wet so I would actually get teriyaki sauce on them?  Nobody working there even apologized for the whole situation.   This is the worst wingstop I've ever been to.  Every other wingstop has been great.   I'd go to another wingstop if you can."}
{"text":"Ordered online and arrived about 10 minutes before my order was ready, so my husband orders a beer while we wait and I asked for a glass of water. I was informed that they do not GIVE out water cups but then I wasn't offered to purchase a water. I thought there was a law that if I order food from an establishment I am able to have a glass of water at no cost, I might be wrong about it being illegal but it sure isn't good customer service! Definitely will be going to a different location next time and hopefully they all didn't imply this policy. They were also Very rude when trying to add ranch when our order was finally ready, at least the flamingo and Maryland location always has great customer service no matter how busy they are."}
{"text":"Had a snafu with delivery that was partially my fault but mostly the UBER driver's and the manager took care of it with no hassle to me at all, very professional thank you very much. 

Other than that the food was excellent as normal. They do the best wings around and are much better than that other chain place, even delivered the wings are fresher out of the oil than most. very glad my local wingstop is high quality and hope UBER delivery can keep up."}
{"text":"My kids loves this place!! Thx to my Rhoda!! She brought me here to help my wing fix! LOL OOOOH YUMMMY!!!  It wasn't crowded & love the tables! Sooo we got the 8pc combo each (I got the hickory barbecue). So let me @it!! Let me see why kids loves this place so much! LOL smooches."}
{"text":"Not at all!! And your response lends credence to EXACTLY what I was saying! My son is an adult---his issue was that he does not like confrontation and said 'it's not that serious'! He did not admit to your staff being correct, as HIS order was the portion that was made incorrectly! And he explained that....it made absolutely NO sense to make the entire order over!! There was NO change to the order....the issue was that both orders were made with 'bone-in' and he wanted boneless! My portion of the order, as stated was correct---your staff, wasn't listening to that FACT! 
Free food!!? Chicken?? Really?? NOONE asked for ANYTHING free or complimentary! All I ask for was MY portion of the order that WAS prepared correctly! How do you tell a customer that you aren't going to do that as I was told!  All I did was suggest you provide some ameliorative measures in response to how your staff handled the matter! I didn't ask for or get anymore than what I PAID and asked for!  The receipt PROVES EXACTLY that!!  To resort to name calling---swindler and cheat....sorry, those are two things I am NOT, NEVER have been and NEVER will be! 

It would be impossible for 3 different staff persons to verify anything as there was ONLY one person at the counter!! And she DID verify that she made a mistake!! Again, thank you Edith for telling the truth! 

And, if what you were saying was indeed actual and factual you would have responded and resolved the situation prior to me leaving. The above response again shows just how UNPROFESSIONAL the management AND your establishment is!!"}
{"text":"Called in to place 4 orders the first order i didn't know how many chicken tenders were on the order so i asked what my options were and the girl that answered the call said \"you do know we have online ordering right \" with attitude i said yes i know that so she continued to say she was extremely busy and didn't have time to sit there and go through all my options i was upset because she wasn't nice about it and me and my co workers are regulars there, so i asked her if she wanted me to take my business somewhere else, there is a way to talk to customers and this girl didn't have good customer service at all her tone was out of control i was so upset i asked to speak to the manager Jessica and thats the only reason why i decided to still continue and place my order because jessica was extremely helpful and apologized for the previous girl she was very helpful and if it wasn't for the girl before i would give this place more stars. This business as popular as they are they shouldn't have employees like that answering their phones.  I hope they give jessica i raise cause she handled the situation very good and i hope they keep the other girl in the back some where away from customers!!! Smh"}
{"text":"They are a Busy stop that's for sure. Overall I was satisfied with the Food and service, the fries were soggy? I don't know if that's how they always are though? Sometimes I Feel that if they didn't cook so many at the same time it would help the Fries stay crispy. 
The wings were drenched in the sauce, could have put less sauce and the wings would have still had some crunch to them as well. ( we got the hawaiian) 
Since they were packed, I didn't mind waiting a little longer for fresh food, but was maybe expecting it to taste better. 
The wings were good though, i'll try it again when it's hopefully not so busy."}
{"text":"First & last time at Wingstop....Never again.  
It was told it'd be 10 minutes for my order.  There was only one other table & they already had their food, so I was fine with that.  About 20 minutes later, I went to the counter to check on my order & was told they'd scheck & let me know.  A few minutes later, my name was called.
Just by looking at the fries  ~ I knew they were going to be soggy.  Not only were they soggy, they literally had no flavor.
I ordered 6 garlic Parmesan & 6 hot Boneless wings.....the first wing I had was cold, the rest were at least hot.  That's about the only positive thing I can say.  Both flavors were only coated on the top.  The bottoms were bare.  I also got blue cheese dressing, which also had no flavor.

I won't go into too much detail, but I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning as I was sick most of last night."}
{"text":"This place manages to mess up orders. Also, ordered sauces on the side (they charge .99) and they didn't include them but they're quick to take the money for it."}
{"text":"Always the best. The staff is what makes this stand out. Customer service is always there with these guys & gals.

Wings are great as always, and the fries are awesome! I'm hungry all over again!"}
{"text":"This WingStop is the cleanest and the best service I have ever gotten out of any WingStop in the valley. Don't know what planet this Chris guy is on but these wings were very good and very enjoyable. He must go to wing street or Bww lol. Thank you for great wings and service."}
{"text":"This Wingstop was bomb. And the whole staff grated me with a big welcome to Wingstop which was cool. And the wings were bomb also. This guy below me Franky should know to hold the bag side ways NOT straight up and down! What a clown!"}
{"text":"What a great experience I had today on 9/11 at this Wingstop on Olive. It all started from the cashier Nikki, she greeted me with a smile and that's great feeling, and even the Manager/cook Angela said welcome to Wingstop that was awesome. I placed my order and with Nikki and she talked about the cheese for my fries and she was right. Amazing! And I got a large drink and a roll which was also amazing, and Angela made my wings perfect.  I ordered garlic Parmesan which is my favorite and lemon pepper. My wings were sauced to perfection and I will keep coming to this wingstop cause it made feeling like it was home. Even the Area Manager Adam came bye my table and with big smile and ask how everything was and he was very professional and polite! I will be back for sure. Thank you for your great service... see you soon!"}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed with Wing Stop, and I'll tell you why:  We were the only customers there and it took about 20 to 25 minutes to get our wings.  Although I thought the wings were plump and fresh, the Louisiana Rub made the wings very dry and rather unappealing.  The BBQ wings were excellent though.  The employees were friendly, and I liked the atmosphere with the tvs.  For overall value, however, I thought it was a little too expensive for the quality.  I would probably visit Wing Stop again, but I won't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a total of 4 times, & unfortunately my food was only okay once. The other times my boneless wings were either undercooked, or they plain out just tasted nasty weird. Idk what it was though, but they weren't good. My boyfriend tends to eat anything you give him, except these wings at this location. The Flamingo location never disappoints though! That will definitely keep being our \"go to\" location even though it's so far from where we live."}
{"text":"Best wings we've found anywhere in town...glad it's only a 20 min drive!  Great selection & always awesome service.  We always do carry out and are never disappointed as they get it right EVERY TIME!"}
{"text":"Did an online order for pickup at noon. They were not prepared when we came. They gave us cups and we went by the drink station and it was disgusting. Very unclean and unsanitary. Then they didn't have any Cole slaw and they wanted till the end to tell us"}
{"text":"Wing Stop. by far has some of the best wings in the state. 

If you're a fan of wings, then you need to go to Wing Stop and pick up a dozen or maybe even two dozen right this second. My sister and I go to wing stop often and we have never had a bad expeirence.

The wings at Wing Stop are 100% all white meat, served to order piping hot.  The wings are crispy, moist, and of descent size. The Hawaiian, and Garlic Parmesan were delicious and happen to be my two of my favorites. The Hawaiian styles wing have just the right amount of tangy sweetness and parmesan cheese adds just the right finishing touch. 

What I like best about Wing Stop is that  you are allowed to Mix and match your orders. You can combine regular wings and boneless wings together. Usually, I order a combination of both.  However, bone in traditional is my favorite. I could have ate a few dozen by myself but decided I probably should share.

Everytime I go to Wing Stop I order the homestyle fries which are cut fresh daily. The fries are crispy and golden brown and very tasty.  My sister isnt a fan of fries but enjoys the homemade potato salad, and fresh baked rolls. The rolls are fresh, hot, buttery, and absolutely delicious. 

The prices are reasonable and the food is great. If you decided to eat at Wing Stop arrive early because there is limited seating. 

The staff at Wing Stop are friendly and helpful. So stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to go out for wings he suggested to go to wingstop, I have never been to wingstop before and for it being my first time it was actually pretty good! We ordered the dinner for two got the Traditional wings with original hot sauce and Cajun it's was a lot better than I expected not to mention the fries! Those fries are no joke pretty effin good if you ask me! This place seemed pretty chill and would definitely come back :)"}

{"text":"Terrible food. Nasty lady working behind the counter who was insistent on arguing with me when I told her my food didn't look right.

Food is overpriced and disgusting."}
{"text":"Wingstop does not skimp on the sauce on their chicken. I have always had positive experiences. My go-to meals would have to be the buffalo chicken fingers with the potato salad. The potato salad is very simply made, which is what I love about it. Sometimes they need to cool down with the onions though. It is especially good with the buffalo wings or chicken fingers."}
{"text":"I was told to wait 18 minutes for my wings. They took 25 minutes. All that time I was sitting there, listening to their crappy rap music. Seriously... As for the wings? Nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Love the wings! But most times the staff seems like they hate their job. Could use some better customer service for sure"}
{"text":"Let me start with great wings! I am the type of person that can have wings everyday and I would definitely get them from here if I did lol When we went In they were very friendly and attentive, told us our order would be out in 13 mins and it was. I am very pleased with this place and will be going back"}
{"text":"I already spoke to the rude district manager don't bother trying to call me again.

I went to wing stop today with a digital gift card I got from a legit 3rd party website that sales gift cards at a discounted rate. The same website sells other legitimate gift cards to other stores as well. Well when I ordered my food my wife showed the gift card to the cashier at the register, the cashier had called for his manager to input the gift card. The manager then proceeded to tell me he has to ask his supervisor if he can use the gift card. So we stood at the counter for what seemed like forever to get the word back. The manager then came back and asked to take a picture of the digital gift card, we said ok and he took a picture and said we can have a seat and he'll wait to hear back from his supervisor. We sat down for a while and I had to get up and ask the manager what the deal was. The manager then told me after waiting for so long that they can't accept digital gift cards and that the digital gift cards are fraudulent and that I would have to pay for it. Before I went to wingstop I checked the balance on the gift card and it said I had $25. After bringing my food home that I payed for not using the gift card I checked the balance again and it was $0.00. I then called the customer service to complain about my service and received a call from the district manager who was a very rude person trying to talk over me throughout the whole conversation. According to the district manager the store managers know about not being able to use digital gift cards. Why then would the manager ask to take a picture of the gift card and ask his supervisor if they can use digital gift cards if they already knew they couldn't. Why didn't the manager just say that in the first place. And why after the manager took the picture of my digital gift card do I now have a $0.00 balance when before I arrived at wingstop I had $25 on it? What did the manager do with my gift card money!? Why would they say the gift card is fraud if it came from a legitimate website!? I guess I'll just go to b-dubs from now on. They give me lots of rewards and they're always friendly."}
{"text":"I love wing stop, but hate this location. I've lived in Laveen and have always went to this wing stop but it really has taken a turn for the worse. The customer service is terrible! That older man that took my order glared at me the whole time and mumbled. I've never had such terrible customer service as I've had here. There are Plenty of other options for foot in this area. Go to native New Yorker across the street and avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I've been lucky--- my experiences with this Wingstop are really good.  I usually pick up wings mid-week, around 11p after arriving from the airport.  Customer service is always excellent when I call and arrive to pick up my food.  My order is never wrong and my wings are always super hot.  I'm old school so I usually like hot wings with the bone so I can't speak for the boneless wings."}
{"text":"Crispy tenders were pretty dang fresh, I'd be back just for the chicken. I went with a large combo and now I know I should have stuck to the small.  The service was good until we saw everybody else get their food when they ordered after us and it was past 17 minutes (21 minutes). The fries were burnt as much as possible.  I liked the sugar on them but was sorta sad they were overcooked I didn't even finish them.  They did have my favorite  Flavored Dasani water, strawberry. :). I'd like to try the Mac & cheese but I'm sort of a picky eater.  Oh I enjoyed the Garlic Parmesan sauce on the side.

They are not good for dessert, but lucky Krispy Kreme is next door if you have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Good crispy wings! Love the Louisiana rub and lemon pepper. Have to try other flavors next time."}
{"text":"Called in an order - my wife says \"this lady is being so rude\".  I get on the phone because my wife was simply asking what specials they have.  The young lady in a disinterested rude tone keeps saying there are no specials as I go the website to see specials for that location.  After trying to have a normal order conversation I get nothing but dismissive answers.  So I said ok I'll walk in and place an order.  I get there, ask for a manager, Dominique, who is just as rude and apathetic as the person on the phone.  I tried expressing my dissatisfaction and frustration with trying to place a simple order and she just stares silently.  By the way I asked Dominique the manager if they had any specials and she said no as well.  I then pointed to the sign that said \"special\" and asked again then she said \"oh yeah we have that special\".  It was at this point I made the difficult decision to not give this Wing Stop my business."}
{"text":"Wow! Talking about great food and great service!! I happen to end up at this particular location due to my job hosting a training event over the next couple weeks! Being that I'm very unfamiliar with this side of town I hopped on YELP to find what's in the area! I'm never the type to turn down some wing stop! I ordered via online which is a very convenient and an awesome service that they offer! Lunch breaks can be tricky so ordering in advance is always best! Now I live for the 60 cents boneless wings on Mondays and Tuesdays! This location has always had my order prepared right on time if not before! Fast..efficient.. Delicious! Can anybody ask for anything else??! Nope! I will be returning a few more times while I'm in the area that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The lemon pepper wings and the honey bar-b-que have to be the best in my opinion and my favorite! The homemade blue cheese they make is to die for even though its expensive I still buy extra for my fries! Which by the way the fries are amazing here just make sure you get there before your order is done though' these fries seem to get cold super fast and aren't as enjoyable after reheating! But.. Then again most foods that were precooked prior to warming back up aren't very tasty! This location is almost always clean with fridbdly staff!"}
{"text":"Typically, I try to avoid wings these days. I'm older, and my body just doesn't react the same as it used to when I was younger.

But, tonight was special. It was my dinner break, and they were the closest and most cost effective place to catch the NFL season opener!

I walked in, and there was NOBODY there outside of the employees. Being my first time in a Wingstop, I know I had that \"deer in the headlights\" look on my face. Unfortunately, the young lady working the counter didn't notice that I might need some help, because she was counting down her cash register so she could go home.

Now, I'm relatively bright, and I'm extremely literate, so I figured out what I wanted after a little searching...though, I would have been open to suggestions instead of standing there for five minutes trying to decide what sounded the most palatable.

I ended up getting the 10 wing bone-in meal with fries and a drink for about $11. I opted for the regular \"Hot\" flavored wings, though they did have a decent variety from which to choose if you think you have the gastrointestinal fortitude to palate them. Speaking from former decisions with crazily spiced wings, I do NOT recommend anything rated higher than good 'ol \"hot\".

The wings and fries came out as quickly as could be expected. The wings themselves weren't bad. The \"hot\"was an excellent choice. Not too spicy, not too bland...just right for my liking. 

The fries, though...they were a different story. There were three different levels of french fries in my basket:

1) Just Right
2) Uncooked
3) Burnt to a Crisp

On top of the inconsistency with the fries, they were WAY over salted...almost to the point of not being edible.

The only saving grace for this place was the fact that they were airing the inaugural game of the 2012 NFL season. The service was meh, the food was meh, but the circumstances were fantastic. 

Somehow, that weird gastric/emotional math equals 3 stars."}
{"text":"Highly addicted to wing stop!! They are definitely a great pick when you are having a craving for some excellent chicken options! Personally the Lemmon pepper chicken tenders and the habanero mango flavor boneless wings are my favorite! The Louisiana  rub isn't bad either!  You honestly can't go wrong with almost anything that you order at wing stop! Be sure to try out the cheeses fried as well! The fact that they have online ordering is so much faster than calling on the phone to be put on hold! It's as easy as placing your order and picking it up at the time the assign you to! Everytime I've ordered the meal was ready! This location is pretty good with very nice staff!"}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and my wife wanted some wings. Like most wingtips, this is a hot and miss. It is our experience that wingstop locations lack consistency.
This place was fast and service was good. Staff was courteous and friendly , but wings were bad.  That were unseasoned and dry. We ordered teriyaki , mango habanero, regular and Cajun.  The teriyaki were the wors. Usually , this flavor come out dark since they pretty soaked. These look like boiled wings.  Mango habanero were good. 
This is one of te worst wingstop locations I have tried."}
{"text":"I would give it a four stars for the food, and 2 stars for the waiting time. That gives an average of 3 stars. About the food, I had 10 traditional wings and a side of french fries. The wings are pretty crisp and the sauces are delicious (garlic parmesan and mild, i don't recommend you trying the hottest one though.... personal tolerance). French fries was pretty fresh and crisp too. But the waiting time was 45 mins, for a take out fast food stop, it's just a tad too long right? And the other customers along with me also became impatient at the end."}
{"text":"Pretty good atmosphere I love how the workers are always polite constantly checking on everyone even though it can get a bit busy. I can count on my wings to be the same way each and every time no matter who's working. Hands down better than Buffalo Wild Wings!!!!! And did I mention it's always clean!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Doing this review a couple of years later. My husband likes their wings here, cant remember exactly what we ordered but they were pretty good."}
{"text":"I order takeout from here almost weekly. They're always busy and food is consistently good with the exception of Super Bowl Sunday when they were swamped and our chicken was extra crispy."}
{"text":"When Wingstop first came to Vegas, eh 10+ years or so ago, I was a huge fan. They seemed to have a good quality product, the price was right and it was another option for chicken wings, one of my favorite foods. Maybe it's just me, but over the last couple years they've just moved in line with the rest of the chains like B-Dubs and really don't have anything unique to offer.

This particular location I believe, is one of the largest ones in town, besides the BWW-esque Wingstop Sports locations. After expanding into the building next to it, they've got a pretty large layout with a whole lot of available seating. They've used the space in a way to make things like getting napkins or drinks more convenient, by have two stations on each side of the restaurant. What they haven't done though, is figure out to show sports events, such as the NFL playoffs. We visited here this past Sunday and there was only 2 other guests dining in, yet someone had to ask to get the sound from the game and their TV feed is terrible...skipping, freezing, low quality, etc. I'm not even a sports super fanatic either, but this was a joke and annoying to watch. I got to say, the place wasn't even that clean either. Our table was greasy and even the kitchen, which you can see from the counter, was a mess. 

As far as service goes, there's one guy who we've seen on past visits who is very nice and helpful. The rest of the employees though, seem to be just annoyed at work and have basically no customer service skills. I guess it's a good thing this isn't a full service restaurant, for their sake at least.

Sadly, the food really doesn't save the place either. It's always so hit and miss that we've nearly stopped eating at Wingstop altogether. Unless you ask for wings well done, they come out soggy and slimy. It could partly be due to the fact that they drown the wings in sauce. This last visit, I ordered original hot and Cajun, both of which were so over sauced that I could barely hold on to them. While the hot has good flavor and it's not overly spicy, the Cajun was one of my least favorite things I've eaten here. It was basically Cajun seasoning that seemed to be tossed in water, but not mixed well enough. They were still drenched, but small parts of the wings had clumps of seasoning that made them difficult to eat. The fries are normally good, but similar to wings, come out greasy and soggy unless ordered well done. Seasoning on them is usually pretty inconsistent and can sometimes be so over salted that we end up not finishing half or more of the order.

With the combo that includes 8 wings, fries and a drink for about $10, the price isn't terrible, but it's not great either. Reason being is that sometimes you'll get decent wings...but you're more likely to get smaller and dried out ones. I will say their dipping sauces are pretty good though, which helps a lot when you're taking a crapshoot on food quality.

I'm not really sure what's happened to Wingstop over the years, but with so much inconsistency and lackluster service, it's definitely not my first choice for wings. My advice is stick to the deal days where wings are discounted and any other time, go somewhere else...especially if it's a game day."}
{"text":"Theres been so many problems with employee's attitudes lately. We came in close to 8pm and Joseline asks us what we want. I say \"can i please get an 8 peice boneless combo with..\" and she interrupts me with \"bone in or bone out\" uh... well last time i checked boneless is the same as bone out but i assume thats the lingo they use there so I kinda just let it slide not a big deal. Then we get our food in a big ass bag cause she didnt ask if it was for here or to go. Okay not a big deal. Then they forget the celery sticks but since were dining in its not a big deal to go up and ask. So i go up and a girl asks if im waiting and i said \"well just for celery sticks\" and she goes over to Joseline and tells her. So Joseline walks slowly over to me and hands them over in a rude way.. doesnt even acknowledge me.. shes looking the other way and doesnt say anything like \"hey sorry about that\" or \"here you go\" I work in the food industry and i try not to give out bad reviews, i also try not to be \"that customer\" but cmon. Learn some customer service. How are you gonna hand them over slowly and not acknowledge me. Thanks for the soggy celery sticks. this location sucks"}
{"text":"Messed up my WHOLE order!! I asked for drums only and they failed to do that! My fries I asked for 2 unseasoned and 1 seasoned. They messed it up too!!!!!!!! Horrible place. Never ordering here again"}
{"text":"I got my delivered and the chicken strips were okay but the garlic bread was nasty!  And so were the apple bites.  I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I'm only putting 1 star because of the customer service. He was really slow at taking our order, but he was nice. We waited what seemed like forever to get our food. The taste was horrible and I'm pretty sure the chicken was undercooked because I've been throwing up for the past hour.. I WASTED $30.. spent $30 to get food poisoning. I will never come here again. Horrible... So overpriced. The overall experience wasn't bad, but the cooks should pay better attention. Thanks, wingstop.. you've ruined wings for me."}
{"text":"Great food the Hawaiian is amazing sweet yet has a under kick and makes a party in your mouth the Cajun is the perfect amount of heat the flavor is on point. You can have these wings whether they are boneless or whole wings you have to have the ranch dressing that taste amazing and the fries that can't be copied in anyway great layer back place and the people inside are always full of smiles"}
{"text":"I love wings and gave up on another popular national wing chain where I had ordered from for over 20 years. I was looking for a new place to meet my wing craving and have been eating at thisr location for the past year and a half.  I appreciate the variety of flavors, I never stray too far from my two favorites. The wings are not huge like that other popular chain, but are big enough to get nice and crispy while staying juicy 
on the inside. That's important to me.
The fries are amazing! The season salt has a hint of sweet that take them to the next level. I love them and even purchase some of the season mix to use at home when I make sweet potato fries. Delicious! Do yourself a favor and pick some up on your next visit.  

I really enjoy seeing the friendly faces of the staff when I stop in for dinner. The general manager is often in there when I go and it's nice to see her \"in the trenches\" working side by side with her team to make a great experience for her customers. It's very common that I'll see the local police officers in there and i like that. It's nice to interact with them and I feel safe when they are there. 
From mild to wild, you'll find some delicious flavor that you'll love. If you are a fan of good ranch dressing, look no further.  It might seem like a small detail but it's my favorite in town. I no longer buy it at a grocery store since I don't like the store brands after eating Wingstop's ranch. The only reason for the 4 star review is that they aren't perfect but when there is a hiccup, they own it and make it right. You can't ask for more than that. Give them a try when you are looking for some tasty wings!"}
{"text":"Ordered extra crispy wings, took forever to make though and only half of the 12 were crispy.  Fries were limp and soggy.  Flavor was not mixed very well and wings were partially tossed.  Service was good."}
{"text":"I took my family here today and all I can say is this is not the place to have wings you have to pay $0.65 for extra sauce which was had no taste terrible I would highly recommend Buffalo Wild Wings if you're going to get wings but not Wingstop"}
{"text":"Awesome service! The staff is super friendly and will definitely help you out with wing flavors if you need it. It was my first time trying wing stop and they weren't annoyed by my many questions. Awesome establishment, awesome employees. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"These five stars are mainly due to the excellent customer service from an employee named LaNell. She was super sweet, patient, and went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. We need more people to adopt such a nice, positive demeanor."}
{"text":"I was not happy with my first experience at this Wingstop. I showed up here about 11 o'clock on a Friday night to grab some wings to go... There were 3 employees working with 3 other people sitting down eating when I got here. I placed an order for 18 wings(about $20.00). There was no one else waiting on anything and it took me about 30 minutes to get my wings. The wings were ok. Not great, not bad... The flavors were the same. They were a little soggy and didn't have much of that crisp outside, juicy inside that I like. I wish I would have just ordered wings to go from a bar on the Southside instead of this place. I wont be returning."}
{"text":"This is the second time in a row that the service has been bad. They aren't welcoming at all and the cashier was so rude. The food was dry and usually I can overlook the horrible service because the food is good but this time both were bad. It will be awhile before I go back. I like wings but I would rather not drive this far for mediocre food and rude customer service."}
{"text":"This location is so much better than the one on Tropicana. We need one in Green Valley/Anthem. I would eat here way more if one was closer!"}
{"text":"Wings were Good! But goodness, it wouldn't hurt the people in there to smile once in a while. The guy working the register looked like he really did not want to be there & so monotone! Great customer service can go a long way & make or break someone's experience."}
{"text":"First visit was today.  I went with a friend who couldn't say enough positive things about Sara.  She was right!!  This was my first threading experience....AWESOME.  I have a surgical scar that goes through my eyebrow....with brow make-up she applied....it disappeared.  She also
took the time to show me how to apply lip liner and color to make me look like I actually have lips!!

I'm thrilled and will definitely be back!!  Thank you Sara!!"}
{"text":"Good fucking lord. 22$ for 20 wings?
96 cents for ranch. Wtf....
Never again wingstop."}
{"text":"I need to start by saying I eat boneless wings almost every chance I get because in my head I justify them as being healthy and \"low carb\" with complete disregard for the breading. Wing Stop is stellar for several different reasons. Especially this specific location.

For one thing, they get your name when u are ordering and they actually use it again for personal touch. LOVE this. Secondly the wings.......served hot, cripsy and fast! The flavor of the BBQ sauce is a love affair in my mouth of sweet, brown sugar and smokey mesquite goodness. I cannot recomment the BBQ with ranch dipping sauce enough. Now, the Pamesan Garlic didn't do it for me. This still did not stop me from stuffing them in my face, but just not as sexy as the BBQ.

The food is delicious and the staff is on point with the service by making me feel welcomed from the moment I walked in until I left. The only reason why they are not getting a five star is because I still think Wingstop is a bit pricey. Here's a tip though. On Monday and Tuesday they do offer .50 cent boneless wings....... Just don't let my stalkers know this!!!!"}
{"text":"I like wings.  I took the kids to eat here - 3 of the 4 - and my girlfriend.  We all ate for less than 30 bucks, with food to spare.

3 flavors in the family pack was good.  4 wings for each of the kids, two separate flavors, and hot for us.

The place is kind of small, so none of their tables seat more than 4.  That was ok though.  I have no complaints about this place.  When I want wings, this is one of the places I like to go to."}
{"text":"I use to frequent Wing Stop in Arizona but I hadn't been to this one yet. 

I had a great online order and pick up experience. My Gamma wanted wings so wings is what she received. The website wasn't as easy to navigate but once I figured it out the wait time was reasonable and Gamma said the wings were good. Next time I want wings I'll definitely go here."}
{"text":"I ordered wings from Wingstop on their website on Saturday morning and paid in full for the big fight on Saturday. I was having friends and family over so I ordered 75 wings with 2 potato salads and 1 large fries. Well we live in the Ballantyne area so my husband drove 30 mins to North Tyron to pick up our order. Mind you that when I put the order in online and paid for it, I stated that we were going to pick them up at 6:30pm. My husband had to wait an additional 1 hour for our food. 
When he arrived back home, and I was unpacking our food, I notice that we were short an significant amount of wings. I counted the wings and we only had 30 out of the 75 wings that we ordered. I called back over to Wingstop to inform them that our order was incomplete. We had a friend that was coming from that side of town so I informed them that he would come and pick up the rest. 
Well my friend called me back to inform me that they were only going to giving us 20 of the 45 that were missing. I called back up there to ask them why they were they not completing our order only to be informed that they only thought we were missing 20. I informed them that we were missing 45 originally and that by giving is 20 more, they still owe us 25 more wings to complete our order. Well they said they give us the rest, but we would have to wait an 1hr and 30 mins. Now my friend that was doing us a favor was getting impatient because he didn't want to wait. So I told me friend that he could leave and I would deal with it in the morning. 
Fast forward to Sunday morning, my husband and I both called to be informed that a manager would call us back later that evening. 
Never received an call so we called again Monday morning to be informed that we would not get our completed order not would we be receiving an refund. Do to is arguing with them, for not completing my order. Also the general manager told me that I was wrong because the got our order wrong. When did this start happening in customer service industry? So in general is the food good, yes. Is the customer service great...absolutely not. I don't have the need To lie about my order, if it was right the first time, they would never have heard from me that day. It just run me that wrong way to be told that they cannot compensate me for their screw ups. I file an complaint with the police as well as the BBB."}
{"text":"If your staff are going to attempt to insult your customers by saying something in another language, they might want to make sure they do it in a language your customers don't understand.

Shame really."}
{"text":"I went to the wing stop after reading the reviews and since it was so close to my hotel. I ordered the six piece wing combo with mild and teriyaki sauces and it was great! The ranch sauce that came with my wings was good and I also enjoyed the fries the wings were cooked perfectly. I will certainly return before I head home from vacation, service was quick as well!"}
{"text":"Let's start with this - the wings are really good. They have a good selection of sauces, sure to please everyone. The wings are a little smaller than I'm accustomed to but that doesn't distract from the fact that they are SUPER tasty! I LOVED the Atomic sauce. Oh man, I'd like to take home a gallon of that - but it might eat its way through whatever container it was put in...Hmm. The sides are delightful, especially the bourbon baked beans. How can that not be good? Home made goodness like all the other sides and you can clearly tell. The cole slaw is amazing and so is the potato salad.

But what makes this place is the people here. The whole team seems genuinely committed to making sure things are done right, that the food is top notch and that the service is exactly what you'd expect. The manager is a pure delight and she is super friendly. After being in business only 3 months they seemed to have hit a good stride and have things cranking very well. Their plans to expand could have some great wings near your neighborhood very soon. And if they do? Get there. Get some. Get extra beans....."}
{"text":"While I was around my neighborhood on a small shopping trip with a mission for beer and a bottle of tequila, I noticed a new restaurant has opened up called Wingstop.

I've never eaten at a Wingstop before, but I'm all about some good wings with beer! 

The sign said open for business, so I stopped in to check it out. The aroma of the wings hits you as you enter in and because the place is so new [5 days old], the place has am immaculate look to it with the tables almost full of patrons who are eating or waiting for their order.

The cashier immediately says, \"Hi, welcome to Wingstop\" with enthusiasm. With a smile to match her energy, I did feel welcomed.

I let her know that I was just checking things out and without pushing products on me, she let me know that she was there to answer any questions if I had any.

The menu board was simple, not to complicated, and had quite a few flavor selections all menu items bundled with drinks and fries of different varieties.

I perused the menu and found something I would enjoy.

I ordered the 10 piece wings and had 2 choices of flavors. I chose garlic parmesan and BBQ wings.

I did not know that they came with a drink and side of fries. WOW! All for 11.99! Good deal! 

I placed my order and began walking around observing the dinging area. Lot's of seating, clean tables, and the patrons seem to be enjoying their meals.

I chatted it up with the cashiers and then eventually the manager asking if it was okay to take pictures for Yelp. He smiled and let me know that it was totally fine.

After receiving my order, which wasn't a very long wait at all, I headed home.

I couldn't wait to take a bite of the food and here's my assessment:

The wings, they were cooked just right, juicy and not drowning in butter garlic sauce or BBQ, plus I was given ranch dressing [You do get to choose your dipping sauces], The fries were soft, I prefer mine extra crispy but, that's my fault, I should've said something.

They Coke products but I did find a green tea that I enjoyed as it wasn't too sweet and so refreshing on such a hot day here in Las Vegas.

The customer service, the wait time for my food, and to biting into my wings seemed flawless and worth the wait.

I'm happy this place is now just down the street and is  another offering in the downtown Las Vegas area adding to the diversity of food to choose from if you're like me who resides in the area.

I'll be coming back again when I have them wing cravings! If you're in the Charleston/Maryland are, come stop in for a some good wings to enjoy!

{"text":"I was in the mood for some wings, and after looking around on yelp I found wing stop. I was sort of weary because it's a chain (I hate BWW and hooters, blegh) but decided it was worth a try. I'm SO glad I did. 
I ordered to go and my fianc√© picked it up. He said the woman was very polite and the transaction was easy. Our order was correct, so far winning on all fronts as last time I went to Buffalo Wild Wings we waited forever for our to go order and it was wrong TWICE. Anyway-
I ordered 8 wings, half mango habanero, half Louisiana dry rub, an a side of coleslaw. My fianc√© ordered the tenders with atomic sauce, fries, and cheese sauce. 
The wings I had were AMAZING! Just crispy enough. The dry rub was so tasty, wjayeb spice combo was used scratched my itch perfectly. The mango habanero was sweet and had a great heat to it. Much better than BWW mango habanero. The coleslaw was dry (in a good way! I hate coleslaw drowning in sauce). It was refreshing and a great way to cool down my mouth after the habanero. 
I ate some of my fianc√©'s cheese fries and the cheese sauce was delicious as well. The fries are fresh cut and soft, the way I like them. 
I'm glad we tried this place because so often we want wings but never know a great wing place that isn't a half hour drive away."}
{"text":"Wingstop is a major guilty pleasure. 

Their Louisiana rub and mild sauces are my favorite. I've only had the bone in wings and they are awesome! The blue cheese dressing is super thick. 

The fries are great too!!!

But don't come here if you're on a diet!! This is a great place if you're looking to indulge every once in a while."}
{"text":"Wingstop takes me back to my college days in Las Vegas when me and my friends would make runs to this place after classes. I was so relieved to discover several of them since I moved to AZ! This location is most convenient to me and is consistently yummy like the one I went to in Vegas. The place is so simple; chicken wings, boneless wings or chicken fingers a limited amount of sides and dipping sauces. I love it because their traditional wings are not breaded and they make each batch fresh when you order them. My fav flavors have to be garlic Parmesan and the lemon pepper, and when I'm in the mood, BBQ. Their fries are delish too, they are super fresh and they season them with a mix of this salt that has a hint of sweetness to it...it's seriously addicting. The fries dipped in their ranch dressing is an orgasmic experience for me, the sweet, salty crunchy mmmm just delish! The ranch is the good kind too, it's nice and thick no watery dressing found here! 

This is my go to spot when I just want to pick up some quick and easy food. Wingstop I'll see you later this month :-)"}
{"text":"Avoid this location ordered meal online got there wasn't the correct order. Had to wait 30 mins for them to actually make my order. They promised that I would get a free order next time I call in. Called in and they said it wasn't written down. Owner lied to my face never going back to this location"}
{"text":"Ordered 6 boneless, received 4. First explained as \"ran out\" then it was because the order had been read as 3. Huh???

One set of two garbage cans underside of counter. Cashier takes order, handles cash, fills drinks, hands out food, puts trash into garbage can and empties the garbage can AND NEVER WASHES HER HANDS.

About 20 tables in restaurant. One garbage can handle trash from two tables. Overflow of trash falls all over counter, floor, employees. And you guessed it! Trash, food waste and all accompanying human goop being cleaned up by hands who periodically stop to fill drinks and deliver trays of food.

Who designed this place and does it have any semblance of a manager?"}
{"text":"If I could rate no stars I would. We placed our order online at 10:01 to avoid the wait. Our pick up time was 10:24, we arrived and paid for our order at 10:29. We sit and wait for them to call our name since they told us to have a seat. 10:55 comes along and people who came after us get called up so we finally get up to ask. Apparently our food has been sitting there the entire time. The manager fries to tell us its not their fault because we didn't say anything. We definitely didn't won't be coming back. They're a bunch a idiots."}
{"text":"Every time I come here my order is wrong and the workers are rude. Placed an order for me and my coworkers today and while calling to place the order I was hung up on several times before getting an actual answer. When I arrived and asked why the manager simply said they are short staffed! Being shirt staffed doesn't mean disrespect your customers and just hang up on them. Wasted my full break and more time to get some cold food and horrible service WILL MEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION"}
{"text":"My favorite Wingstop in town! Staff is super friendly, cooks are great and efficient. Everyone seems so happy enjoying some tasty wings with quality service."}
{"text":"When I lived in Texas, I went to Wingstop all the time.  Loved their wings and their fries are the best.  This is the fourth time I've visited this location since moving to Vegas.  And I'm done.  The service is surly and dreadful.  I waited almost 30 minutes for an eight piece and my fries are cold.  The wings are ok.  But BW3's are better here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped into Wing Stop with family to eat lunch and watch the Panthers game.  The food was delicious and the service was excellent.  I would recommend the Mango Habenero wings if you can take some spice.  Great spot overall!"}
{"text":"Order a large \"seasoned fries\" I don't know how you make cooked to order and have it handed to you cold, soggy, greasy and over salted fries but they do. Just terrible food ... it's sad when a place called fat burger is the healthy option."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were planning to eat at Wingstop and had issues with calling in our order. First, we got hung up on. Second, the number was not in service. And lastly, we finally got someone and was on hold for almost 8 mins."}
{"text":"the service here was excellent! woman up front was very helpful, our food came out fast, and the guy who brought it out was super polite. unfortunately, these wings are not good. i got barbecue and teriyaki. i'm currently sitting at home writing this review while looking at them pitifully. pretty disappointing. this will be going in the trash instead of my tummy"}
{"text":"The last couple of months I've  been stopping at  Wingstop in the Santa Fe, wings have recently  been an excitement  due to their newest addition The Korean  spicy  wings...wow  deliciously  good...
Last night I had a mix up in my order and call this morning  to the manager ,...Diana,  wow, took care of the mixup efficiently and promptly  and delivered great customer service,   promoted up sales with their other flavors.  Living here we sometimes don't  always recognize great customer service and this gal reeks of it... all of these team members are considerate,  proficient and respectful ! as I was enjoying  my French fries Diana brought an elderly women her order and noticed a spill, she was right on it, customer  safety. ..Yahoo this manager cares...someone needs to give her a shout out...GOOD JOB DIANA!  When you come to visit tell her Katherene sent you...lol"}
{"text":"Wingstop is a pretty good spot for wings close to UNLV. To me its kind of like a fast-food version of Buffalo Wild Wings. You order off a board and and they bring the food out to ya, doesn't have a full bar but features a couple beers on tap/bottles and has a strong sports bar feel to it. Not sure why but this location seems to have ton of employees working (really just standing around) so service is pretty quick.

You can pick from regular or boneless wings along with a couple different sauces/dry rubs. If wings aren't you're things they have some other stuff on the menu also, along with fried pickles, kinda random but worth checking out lol.

I can't say much on the regular wings, not a fan of bone, but the boneless ones aren't bad. I kinda noticed that the breading was a little thicker than bdubs but still good. The wings are served wet, plenty of sauce/rub and are pretty big. Flavor range on their sauces is pretty standard, hot, medium, teriyaki, bbq, garlic parm, nothing unique Unfortunately for what the place is, its not cheap, about $10-12 bucks for a 8 piece combo with their soggy-ass fries and a drink. Overpriced for what you get and they still charge you a buck for ranch, smh... After lunch they have a daily \"happy hour\" specials that change each day, but they are pretty meh...

Its not bad, but there are better places for wings. But hey.. they got that cool touchscreen soda fountain!"}
{"text":"Man me and my wife decided to go here for lunch it was so fresh we ordered ahead and once i got home it was still fresh and hot we got the parm fries extra parm the smell is very loud if you attempt to get them lol but there great with ranch on the side. we got lemon pepper and lousiana rub along with my new fav the spicy korean extra krispy it was FIREEEEEEEEEEEEEE def wil be back. we dont eat much fried food at all but this was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed flavor less chicken purchased lemon pepper and mango habanero and no seasoning nor sauce covering full chicken. Tried to give them an opportunity to correct yet I was put on hold for over 20 minutes with no management available I was told they were extremely busy yet not busy enough to collect my $35.00 purchase. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from this location today and I have to say, I always enjoy Wingstop. These wings were especially big and I liked the fact that there was not a ton of sauce in the package of wings. I got their potato salad as a side (which honestly rivals my own grandmother's recipe) and a Coke and was set! Now my stomach is nice and full for the evening. If you like spice, try the Cajun flavor!"}
{"text":"I called in a pickup order about 10:15 PM on a Sunday night, before closing at 11. The food was on time and the staff were super-friendly and helpful. The food was hot and tasty. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Mismanaged!  The service was barely adequate as the cashier picked up the phone three times as she took my order, the bathroom is out of supplies, and they are out of veggies.  I hope the chicken tastes as good as the previous reviews."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the prices are a bit steep for chicken wings. The sweet BBQ is my favorite flavor but almost all are good. It does irritate me that they charge extra for all dipping sauce. It should come with the wings."}
{"text":"over priced, greasy wings... i was really disappointed that i went to this place, the wings were greasy and grossed me out after the first few.."}
{"text":"Finally found my wing place in Arizona. Good sauces top great wings. Made them all drums like we asked."}
{"text":"Okay, I finally understand the hype regarding the food here. However, the inside dining area leaves A LOT to be desired and I recommend getting your food to-go.

I decided to make a stop during my holiday break and walked in to place my to-go order. I ordered the six wing combo - half lemon pepper and half BBQ - with fries and drink. The cashier told me the wait would be 17 minutes (which I was surprised at and wished I'd called ahead) so I walked around the strip mall area a little bit.

After about 10ish minutes, I walked back and my food was ready. I grabbed my cup and made my way to the drink station which was absolutely gross and a mess. I chose sweet tea but they have their tea in a Gold peak dispenser where you press which flavor of tea you want. What came out can best be described as light brown water. NOT GOOD. I threw it all down the sink when I got home.

As for the food, the wings were delicious. Nice, bold flavors and the chicken was nice and crispy. The fries were the winner for me though. Love, love, loved the seasoning and found myself understanding why so many people were asking for seasoning packets at Wingstop.

You will definitely enjoy your food from Wingstop just be sure to call ahead or order online!"}
{"text":"On this particular occasion, the service was a little slow. I will admit that I was not in the best of moods after coming up empty in the Bingo room, so the wait was not as long as it felt.

I have been to this location before, but not since discovering the Garlic Parmesan fingers at one of their other locations. The fingers were just as I remembered. Hot, fresh and full of flavor. The fries fell a little short and should have been much hotter, based on our wait time. 

There are many dining options inside the Santa Fe, but I will definitely return to Wing Stop at some point. Decent food, plenty of seating and the prices really aren't too bad despite being inside of a casino."}
{"text":"Just this past Wednesday my sister and I always at least will go twice a month pick a place to eat just her and I. We picked Wingstop. I had this maybe 2 years ago. Same with my sister. Well the customer service was great. Alondra, Caretha, Sussie, Orlandis and Jeorge you guys worked all together to make our lunch was special. Everyone was welcoming and polite. 

It was so good we had to tell our work about it. And guess what was for our Company lunch yesterday Wingstop!!! Thanks to everyone at Wingstop Santa Fe Station Casino keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"I love wing stop! It's always fast friendly and very yummy. The wings are hot and crispy. The original wing sauce has delicious flavor with the right amount of heat. It's also really convenient to order your wings online and then go over and pick them up."}
{"text":"Never been to wing stop and went for the first time while in AZ for Ironman. GREAT service! We got a bit lost locating wing stop and they were kind enough to make us two new batches of fries for FREE. My favorite word in the dictionary. Wings were great too. Highly recommend the lemon pepper and traditional buffalo wings. Definitely will be back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"First of all it wingstop what can you say that hasn't already been said. But I will give my favorite. I get the same thing all the time... I don't like change. My favorite is the Lousiana dry rub and the Cajun. The Cajun is super spicy but I love it, the Lousiana is salty but it kinda cools down my mouth after the spicy Cajun. The other note it the soda machine, they have the 1000 different sodas in one machine. May favorite is the raspberry coke. It's so good it makes me wonder; why we don't have more raspberry things"}
{"text":"So I walk in after a day of school and I order some boneless wings. I get 20 boneless wings, with three sauces; garlic parmesan, medium, and traditional hot. I did not get any sides, except for a drink. I will say that the drink selection is very diverse, with one of those Coca-Cola machines with the touch screen that you have about 100 selections. That is a plus. 

But then I get my wings. The medium and the hot were good enough and were not overcooked, but the garlic parmesan had all the sauce at the bottom and yet the wings were overcooked (it was very hard to chew.)

I will say that this place is not environmentally friendly, the to-go boxes and the drink cups are Styrofoam.

Yet they sure skimp on the cleaning products, because my table seemed sticky and my seat had some crumbs. 

The prices were very modest and inexpensive (for wing prices.) I will say, though, that it is worth paying some extra cash for wings at Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with the diversity of sauces and sides available to order. Great for big groups!

Great and speedy service ensured that our order was placed and deliver in a very expedited manner.

Overall great quality of food, the wings and fries were cooked to perfection.

Doing a great job, guys, keep it up!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. the workers
always act like they're having a terrible day."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! Ordered and paid for my food 2 hours before scheduled pick up & still had to wait almost 30 min for my food! I will be contacting store & district manager tomorrow morning!!!"}
{"text":"I've had Wingstop before, I like their food for all it's extremely messsy.  This was the first time I'd ever ordered online for pickup.  I have exactly 30 minutes for my lunch break, if I'm late it's termination.  Using the website, I put in my \"future\" order two hours early, at 7:15pm knowing it would take at least 12-15 minutes to get there so it would definitely be ready in time.  I was starving and would probably eat the whole thing in my car on the way back to work.  
I arrive, give my name, have my credit card out and they stare at me.  \"We don't have an order under that name.\"  Seeing my face, the manager came over, trying to make excuses- \"Did you send it to the right location?  Maybe there was a computer error cause we never received that order\"
The girl working the register, all the while, is going through all the printed out online orders and finds my order in the middle of the stack.  I'm still staring dumbstruck at the manager, he takes the order and says, \"Sorry, we can have this done in 7-8 minutes.\"  I reply that I can't possibly wait, I was already going to be late if I didn't book it back to work.  He apologized again but never even offered to issue me a refund.
I can't in good conscience, advise anyone, even my frenemies, to go here.  Epic Fail, Wingstop, you failed me and now I get to beg almonds from my coworkers and steal year-old suckers from the lady 2 rows over."}
{"text":"Listen the food is good. No question. Unfortunately for this location ordering ahead doesn't do much good. Today was my second experience ordering ahead online both have resulted in watching my order starting to be made when I arrived. It's a shame they're sabotaging themselves."}
{"text":"Ate there last night with my husband and outside of the exceptional customer service and good prices (hence the two stars), I will never be back. I ordered the mild boneless wings with fries and was completely disappointed. The sauce had way too much of a \"buttery\" taste and one of the ingredients the fries were seasoned with was SUGAR! So disgusting. Is this a new thing?? About an hour and a half eating there I got mild food poisoning. Although it's hard to 100% blame them as the cause...I would bet a lot of money my wings weren't cooked properly. I'll be sticking with Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Would like to give this place a 3.5 star.

Closest Wingstop to me in Gilbert.

Pros
Easy parking lot.
Easy to order online.
Open late

Cons
For this particular location, when I picked up my order late at night, there were only two workers. One at the cashier and one in the kitchen.
Tons of people sitting inside, but they were all waiting for their food.
I order online and somebody order right before me as well.
The couple in front of me got their food first, and I was next.
Seeing how there was only one person in the kitchen, even though I order online, it took longer to get the food. I had to wait maybe another 15-20 minutes in addition to the online waiting. 

I recommend to order online and earlier, as you don't know how many people are working that night in the kitchen.

Food remains pretty consistent with other Wingstop. Still Loving the Cajun and lemon pepper and of course their fries."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a franchise fast food restaurant? Then been to another fast food restaurant of the same franchise? Well that's pretty much what eating at a Wingstop (or McDonalds, Burger King, Subway, etc) is like.

Still don't get what I mean? Well let me just say the wings tasted just like any other wings I've had at other Wingstops. I prefer the Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan and they were quite delicious. Go for Bone-In so you know you're getting meat all from chickens and not reconstituted misc chicken meat that is the Bone-less chicken.

This particular Wingstop was a bit busy (probably time of day - evening) and the tables were a bit greasy. There seemed to be more than enough crew members behind the counter, but no one stepped up to give the tables a good wipe down. Not a big deal (at least for me) since we're not at a gourmet, sit down, high falutin, top shelf establishment.

Anyhow, if you're hankering for wings then I would definitely go to Wingstops as opposed to Buffalo Wild Wings. Just keep in mind that it really only has Wings and nothing else really. If you're looking for Wings, maybe burgers, maybe pseudo healthy salads, then go Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"This is my first time in wing stop the staff was very helpful and courteous. The store is clean .!! I will be back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the different menu because it's a WingStop Sports.  New in the Vegas market and I was not disappointed.  I had the grilled chicken club and it was delicious along with the lemon pepper fries.  What was really impressive was how the staff continues to make sure your having a great experience.  You'll never have to get up for anything.  Sports, Wings, Alcohol and Great service-nuff said."}
{"text":"I have to say that I have tasted much better lemon pepper wings these were dry and the flavor was too bland. I called ahead to ensure this flavor was wet and not dry. The young woman stated it was wet, well it was dry and did not hit the spot at all. Please, get a true lemon pepper flavoring for the wings. Wet lemon pepper seasoning has butter in it, lemon, pepper and seasoning salt mixed together, put the fried/baked wings in a plastic bag with the liquid seasoning and flavor the wings. Definite \"no\" to the fries, even ketchup did not help them."}
{"text":"Seeing as I make the best wings ever, I have high standards on the wing front.  This place was okay... I did like the fries, interestingly sweet.  If I'm in the mood for wings and I don't feel like cooking I might come here... although I think The Vine has good wings for really cheap."}
{"text":"So freaking slow. No body else in here and yet I sit and wait for my food FOREVER. It's a good thing I'm not hungry. Geez"}
{"text":"The wings tasted good. We had the Hawaiian, original hot, and lemon pepper. The lemon pepper was my fave! I think the only thing I'd say is maybe it's best to just eat there instead of takeout! Probably would taste more better! But overall not bad and would definitely recommend if you're craving for wings. Price isn't too bad either :)"}
{"text":"Made my first ever visit to this Wingstop and was very satisfied with the service and the food. Don't believe the hype! This place is great!"}
{"text":"BEWARE OF ONLINE ORDERS!!

Don't get me wrong, I love WingStop.  Back when I lived in Texas they were everywhere.  What I don't love is the online ordering system at this location.  Less than a month ago I placed an order for pick-up after I got off work.  I go to pick it up right on time...and had to wait.  35 minutes.  What's the point of ordering online ahead of time?

Fast forward to today, when I placed an order to pick-up during my lunch break.  I arrive and tell them I ordered online and gave them my name... the response?  \"We only have one online order open, did you order under the name Caroline?\"  I show them my e-mail proving I ordered for pick-up at this location...the cashier just kind of stared at me, offering nothing but a 20 minute wait time to fry up a batch of wings.  

TL;DR Don't order online here, they'll screw it all up."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 starts I would. I order 10pc. Order not a huge went in to Oder to go. 45 minuets later still nothing customers that came way after me got there order except me terrible customer service and to top it off when I asked all she said was nkt yet and turned around never will I stop here again !"}
{"text":"I'll give 5 stars once you bring back the SERRANO PEPPER! that was soo good!
I love that you can order it crispy  soo good"}
{"text":"Went to this wing stop for the first time since this location opened...upon walking in, I was greeted by about 15  employees in unison which I found slightly comical yet annoying as I had a headache and was on the phone..after I ordered, the cashier begged me to do a survey for him before I had even received my food..again super annoying... But I did it...I received my to go order of boneless louisana rub and lemon pepper...both were severely salty and over seasoned... But their tea was great with the fresh lemons they had and the restaurant was very clean..I'll give them sine time to adjust before going again"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the wings and fries at this location. It does need some work with the front service. But other than that, the food was delicious and I think their dry rub is one of the best out here in Mesa that I've had. If they could get their customer service up to par I would consider giving the rating a 5 Star Review."}
{"text":"The wings are really good. The employees are really bad. Alexander has no clue what good customer service is. Very rude tone. I preordered to pick up at 12, I come in at 11:52 and Alexander says \"you're 8 minutes early it's not ready.\" There was no one in the store, the employees were literally standing around until I walked in then they actually started cooking & doing their job, wow. So I come back at 12:10, they tell me it's still not ready. I work in the food industry as well, and this was definitely terrible."}
{"text":"Be ready to wait. I order the lemon pepper wings they were ok they had a weird smell. I have had them before and loved them but this time they were disappointing. The staff is so unfriendly, I think that  is part of their requirements because I have visit this place twice different employees same treatment.I will go to another wing stop but not this particular location"}
{"text":"This place is almost always a disaster. The online ordering does NOT work - ever. Literally, I've tried it three times, and I always show up and have to place my order at the front. The wings are tiny, but they do taste good and they are definitely cooked to order, which is a plus. Overall, they are not doing anything worth writing home about."}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering here and it was okay.  The food was okay but the customer service is awful.  When I came in i had to wait until the cashier got through from talking with her fellow employee that was not working.  As I write this review I see the employees lounging across the counter having an irrelevant conversation.  One customer just left because he was not getting the help he needed.  I work in the restaurant business and I feel that customer service is highly important."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! Food is consistently good, service is always up to par. 
One time we waited around an hour for our order. We brought the receipt up to ask if something was wrong and the staff was very apologetic and gave us our order for free. Some sort of technical issue. 
Much better than Buffalo Wild wings. You get great value for your money"}
{"text":"Garlic parmesan wings were A+. Fries are good, maybe a bit too bold tasting. Only gripe is parking is a pain.  I recommend ordering online for pickup!"}
{"text":"It's not bad, it's not great. It's conveniently on the way home from work so I have ordered ahead a couple of times. Both times I ordered 30-45 minutes ahead, and when I arrived I still have to wait ten minutes for my order. Staff is really nice and they have thrown in extra fries for the inconvenience of waiting. Speaking of, I don't like the fries at all. :P They just don't travel well ten minutes away from home and end up soggy/cold real fast. I can't complain about the wings though--wings are all right."}
{"text":"Unorganized service! Ordered wings for super bowl Sunday at 11am with a pick up time of 3 pm. Arrived at 310p and the wings weren't ready until 350pm!!  The lines were long with all irate customers since orders were incorrect including mine!! The employees were all busy running around and bumping into each other.  Management must be terrible since they failed at organization and execution of an incredibly busy day. We will never be returning again!"}
{"text":"I don't care how good the food is, the service at this location is horrendous and it's not even worth it. I've lived in the area for many years and have frequented this location more than once. If this review was  a few years ago I would have gladly give them more stars but there is no way they deserve one! 

We were in the area and wanted wings, so I decided I'd call ahead to place the order. The phone was busy for awhile and when I finally got through to someone she put me on hold and continued to do so over and over; they never did make it back to the phone to take my order, I sat on hold until I was about a block away when I finally hung up. We went in to the place the order, which took them a minute because they spent time looking at one another, walked away like we were invisible and then finally someone decided to take our order. They acted like they were beyond bothered they even had to work and not only was is it not that busy, they were just putting people on hold to avoid placing their order (BTW if you were a caller on Tuesday evening on 05/20 and someone kept answering and just putting you on hold, no it was not busy and yes the dipshits were doing it on purpose) My husband decided to stay with our food because like the reviewer two posts down, who put in their order and it was just sitting and no one told them, was the same experience we had on our last visit and no they did not apologize to us either.  

This is our 3rd bad service and last time we will order from this location (unless there is a total turnaround). The customer service or lack there of is ridiculous! Their wings can be good all day long, but I am not about to pay  for food if their employees act the way they do and deliver the service that they do. If CS is meaningless to you, then you can gladly consider them 3 to 4 stars.... but it depends on how cold your food is from the lack of consideration they have for customers."}
{"text":"This place was aggressively disappointing.

The french fries are sprinkled with table sugar. So nasty.

The wings are tiny.

The Original Hot flavor could be sold to Gerber for consumption by infants. Tastes good, but absolutely mild.

The Atomic flavor has the opposite problem - spicy, but doesn't taste good. And unlike a buffalo chicken wing, the Atomic sauce is the consistency of tomato paste. This is not a buffalo wing.

The carry-out packaging is nice, but the fries were thrown in there loose. And all the food I received was just above room temperature. Bad form.

One and done on this joint."}
{"text":"I live in the neifbborhood and wingstop has pretty decent wings.  I think only Oreganos does them better.  Worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Wingstop and the quality of the food that they serve at this location. The employees  are nice and don't mind if you need to take extra time to figure out what you want. The establishment is clean and very open. The food is always good and hot wings taste delicious everytime."}
{"text":"Maybe should have a little bit of common sense when dealing with great customers. False accusations are a fast way to lose business."}
{"text":"These wings stopped me ! It's New Year's Eve so I had to grab some wings before head out to the strip. Didn't know I could have ordered in advance so I didn't have to wait 20 minutes for some wings. Pretty crowded, and take outs kept flying in and out so business was booming. 


Small low key spot for some wings. Servers were very nice. I ordered the mango habanero, garlic parmesan and the lemon pepper. 

Boy the mango habanero really have some  kick to it. I really enjoyed this flavor. The garlic Parmesan was okay I enjoyed it a lot less. The last flavor lemon pepper chicken was pretty much horrible. All I taste was salt, really tough to eat. I paid for it so I had to munch away anyways. 

Wish the cooks took more time preparing, 20 minutes for salt chicken was tough to eat. Everything else was pretty much perfect. Not my first time here. But I'll be back !"}
{"text":"Last night was our first time at wingstop to eat. I will note that i attended a yelp event here close to a year ago. We were able to sample their wings and sides so i knew the food would be good

We decided on the 12 piece wing meal. It was with a large fry & choice of two sauces. We chose Mango Habenero (recommended by cashier) & Garlic Parm. The mango Habenero was extra spicey. In weak when it comes to spices. Luckily the ranch settled my burning tongue lol. Garlic parm were great. Wingstop does a great job seasoning their wings. We noticed a sign saying wings are  made to order so that's cool 

Fries were fresh cut and had a great season on them. At the event I tasted all of their other sides and they were great too 
 
Def a good wing spot"}
{"text":"The wife is a fender Wingstop she love the way you stare me I think they could be a little bit better but it's alright"}
{"text":"If you live in or near Mentor and, like me, you enjoy some chicken wings then LOOK NO FURTHER than Sam's! Oh... I should say, Wing Stop!

This restaurant quickly became one that my entire family became regulars at. Want to know why?

The owner, Sam, is one of the kindest people I have ever met. He really cares about his customers and wants everyone to enjoy their food. He has always gone out of the way to make sure that everything is as we would like it. He is also a funny guy. When I meet up with my family and we want to get some food, if someone mentions \"Sams\" then we pretty much end up going here.

I prefer boneless. But seriously, the food is good! The boneless wings are delicious (I call them wings, you might call them strips) and the sliders are equally as good. My brothers sometimes prefer the regular wings but im not one for bones. The sauces are all yummy. I like hot and bbq the most. The new cajun dry rub is pretty good as well.

Make sure you get fries! My friends and I practically addicted to Wing Stop fries. They put salt and sugar on them. A guilty pleasure is dipping them in the ranch sauce.

They also have beer on tap and in bottle. Pitchers are cheap as well!"}
{"text":"If I could vote zero stars I would. The garlic parm wings here are terrible. They're plain wings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and minced garlic at the bottom of the tray.
There are tvs inside to watch the football games but good luck getting the sound on. Apparently none of the tvs have sound. This wouldn't have annoyed me as much as it does if there was a least music on in the restaurant. All I had to listen to while eating was the music coming from the kitchen and other customers talking.
I ended up throwing away most of my food because of the quality. Definitely never going to a Wingstop again."}
{"text":"My wife and I are very particular about where we buy food. The buffalo wings were great. The location was very clean and the online ordering worked out fine. The two areas that need work are the parking situation and the staff could be friendlier."}
{"text":"Service is blah. Wings are worse no matter the flavor you get this weird sweet unpleasant after taste. Definitely not worth the money. If you want good wings go across the street to native."}
{"text":"Love wing stop. Probably my favorite place for wings. But I'm always disappointed when I walk in a place and multiple employees are on their phones and cussing."}
{"text":"I will NEVER order from this Wingstop in Vegas. They gave me scraps instead of French fries.  Shameful."}
{"text":"Great wings!  Always great service.  This restaurant is very clean and everyone is very friendly.  It's nice to find a place with quality wings.  All chain pizza joints have god-awful piles of garbage posing as chicken wings.  Not this place.  Please don't confuse it with Wing Street--they are not in the same league.  Many flavors of wings and boneless wings.  I can never go wrong with the standard 'hot.'  The only problem I have when I go here is that I usually order too many.  At least they're good cold from the fridge."}
{"text":"Just ordered over the phone. Ive usually had to wait at other wingstops for the associates to start making my order upon my arrival. I was surprised to see that it was ready about a minute after i paid. The staff is very kind and accurate! THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"We always love coming here! Their wings are incomparable to anything out here in Vegas. My favorite is the Lemon Pepper \"Bone In\". We always get the fries with no seasoning, but they taste great either way. I love the to veggies they give you too for each meal. Their ranch is awesome! Service is always nice too. Sometimes it may take a little bit, but they make them fresh to order, so they're BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"I love the regular fries here, but on my most recent trip I tried the Voodoo wings and they were equally as amazing. They are fries with the Cajun seasoning, ranch, and cheese on them.  so good! The chicken is usually good but the wait times are what make me give a 4 instead of a 5."}
{"text":"We like to call ahead so our wings are ready when we get there.  We like the boneless mild and garlic parm wings.  The fries are ok - they're pretty soft and have a sugary taste to them.  All in all...good stuff.  Just call ahead if you don't want to wait 15-20 mins for food.   Mmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get my wings! I love this place, not like other spots where they barley put any sauce in the wings these guys actually make them saucy and delicious."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with the service of this place. Wings were excellent, although a bit pricey. This location is also sandwiched amongst a property of other fast-casual restaurants, so there isn't a whole lot of space inside to hang out and eat. But the service was great, and they had TV's for sports. Not much else to ask for from a wings joint."}
{"text":"I wasn't a big fan of wings until I had the lemon pepper wings from Wing Stop.  I love the fact that they naked fry their wings.  I don't like the heavy battered wings.  Yuck.  Back in Houston, I would eat those wings at least once a month.  Honestly, I did not like the fries the few times I had it in the beginning, but I grew quite fond of them.  There must be sugar as one of the ingredient of the seasoning or something.  Whatever it is, I dig.

The good thing about Wing Stop is that they all make the same delicious wings, from taste to texture.  I have not found a soggy wing yet...and hopefully will never!!!  Anyways, since we were on a time crunch, I put the order in online for dine-in and that was very convenient.  The website is user-friendly too.  When we arrived, our food was ready for our consumption.  The staff were nice. 

If Wing Stop wasn't so far from where I live, I will definitely come back more often."}
{"text":"Great wings and fries.  Only problem we had was their drink machine broke down which is a major problem at a wing place.  They fixed it after a minute but nobody dared touch their wings whole the machine was down."}
{"text":"Plan for a 35-40 minute wait if you go inside. It took me almost 20 minutes just in line to order my food. One cashier. I won't be back to this location. The only reason for the 2 stars is the super nice girl running the register tonight."}
{"text":"Have only had Wing Stop one time (not this location) but I was pleasantly surprised. The $8.99 meal was a good value...6 wings, basket of fries and 20 oz drink. Even better, you can pick two different flavors! The Louisiana Rub was REALLY good. I would definitely order that again. I also tried the new Spicy Korean. It was good too. Reminiscent of the \"Asian Zing\" at the other wing place that shall remain nameless. Only complaint, it took about 25 for our wings. Wouldn't go again at lunch time but I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Waited over a hour for wing terrible service I will not eat there again they just lost my business"}
{"text":"Don't have them do delivery for your order.  They use a service called Zoomer and no one tells you that you need to answer a phone call from a random cell number to actually receive your order once the delivery person nears your location.  I took me about two hours from the time I submitted the order online to the time I receive my cold food.  

Fries were seasoned with sugar (?), wings were ok.  

Had a conversation with the owner by phone.  He likes to talk over people.  He was more polite a while after we had spoken, and sent me a text to confirm I had my food.

Wings were acceptable, but cold.  Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Found a hair wrapped into a drum! It was a 20 piece meal and they only offered to credit 8 pieces, despite the fact that it was ALL COOKED TOGETHER which they even confirmed on the phone. The manager stated \"Well sometimes there are still feathers in our wings\"...when this was clearly a very long human hair. Plus I have to use the measly 8 wing credit at that store.. No thank you! Not good management since we had to throw our whole meal away & it should've been fully refunded."}
{"text":"Had the parmesan garlic and teriyaki wings and they were really good.  A nice and clean wing joint. Just don't be in a hurry, takes awhile to get your food."}
{"text":"We come here all the time.... IDK why I have never left a review before 

It's not the closest wing joint, but we always make the trip anyways. I love that we can order online or stop in and the food is always consistently great!"}
{"text":"We put an order in, and they had originally told us 45 minutes. 2 hours later, we still had not received our food. We had called numerous times, and once they hung up on us, and then didn't want to give us our money back, but decided to give us \"free wings\" next time when we order. Don't think we are ordering again from this place."}
{"text":"Service is slow, but the staff are all pretty friendly and helpful. I'm from California and I personally believe that the wingstop in AZ is 10x better!"}
{"text":"So I have been craving some wings and since the nba playoffs are on I decided that it was time to go make this happen. So upon arrival the first thing I did was ask them if they could put on the game so I can enjoy some grub and a little basketball, however, I was informed that their tv's don't work right now :( . So my visit started as a bummer and it made for a eat dash and run so I could get back to the game lol

So after my first let down I told Vanessa that they need to make me the best wings to make up for it and boy did they deliver. I ordered the family pack because overal it's just a better bang for your buck. I had lemon pepper , garlic Parmesan, and Louisa a rub and it was all delicious. There is very few chain restaurants that actually make great food but I must say Wong stop delivered again!!! 

The thing that put the icing on the cake was Vanessa telling me if I fill out a survey I could get a free side and it even included the specialty fries which are extremely cheesy so buyer be ware before ordering. If only the tv's were working......"}
{"text":"Their wings are good. The fries are really good. Service is great. Don't buy wings at a kiosk in your grocery store, Hit up wingstop it's good stuff."}
{"text":"Love this new location! The area is great and the size is perfect inside. They've done awesome with staffing and keeping the inside clean. Overall awesome experience! So glad there is one in our neck of the woods now! :)"}
{"text":"It's posted all over inside the resturant \"made to order\" \"no heat lamps\".....if you've ever made chicken at home, you know it takes a minute. Yes, you will wait awhile for your order, and it's worth it. I always get half lemon pepper and half garlic parm, boneless. I always have to split the fries with someone because it's alot. I think they sprinkle some sugar on the fries too. You may want to call ahead and order it so it will be ready when you get there if you are in a rush or on a time restriction. No use in getting upset because it takes long to get your order..it's being made from scratch!"}
{"text":"This is seriously my spot!!! I don't know how people could possibly leave a bad review on this place. The staff are amazing, my wings are always perfect. I eat here about 3 times a week, there lemon pepper wings are to die for! :)"}
{"text":"Fried chicken wings with many flavors as options and dipping sauces, SOLD. I love me some chicken wings and wings top may have the meatiest around. I unfortunately found them to be a lot more greasy than some other places but the size and flavor options made the a decent ouch choice."}
{"text":"Good wings, but they are always 15 to 30 minutes late with an order. Even if you call, or order online, they never have the wings ready on time. Get ready to wait...."}
{"text":"It's always something every time i come to this location. If you call they will leave you on hold forever and may not come back to the phone or they will have an attitude when you get there like you are bothering them. When people pay for a service it should be done as such. People do not have to spend their money with any company! I only come here because it's the most convenient to my apartment when I'm coming home later from work in the evening."}
{"text":"This location is in a high crime area and management does not care to do anything about it.

Was in this store on a Thursday night where I had a meal.  Before leaving the store, my girlfriend realized that her purse was no longer hanging behind her chair.  There was a homeless man in a wheelchair in the store at the same time who had been lingering around the chair.  We alerted the restaurant workers that somebody had stolen her purse and really only about one employee really seemed to care. She took down our information and we asked if we could review the surveillance footage--in order to submit a police report and start a criminal investigation.  She told us the manager would be in first thing in the morning to review the footage. Its been all weekend and halfway into the next week. No calls from Wingstop manager who was the only one in authority to review the tape. So very disappointed that something so wrong happened to me in their store and they apparently don't give a damn at all.

I will not be returning to this location and I recommend you go somewhere else if you want some decent wings."}
{"text":"The wings here are top-notch. They are juicy and tender, and the flavorings are particularly well done. My favorites are the lemon pepper and Louisiana, both dry rubs. And you can get two or three flavors depending on how many you order, which is great for trying different ones.

Now if you order in-store, you have to be prepared to wait for a bit--we were told 18 minutes, though it was more like 20-25. The service could've been a bit more friendly but it was passable for the most part. We were a bit disappointed that they could not provide cups for water though. A cup for a regular drink was by no means expensive, but this still took us by surprise nonetheless."}
{"text":"I am a first timer here at Wingstop or a virgin foodie wingstopper & I loved getting my cherry popped by eating these really good wings :)
You can say, like many guys do I am wing fiend. Haha This place has some good wings, the bone-in wings are outstanding medium, extra crispy with a side of fries! Very happy with the service, Kathy our cashier/server was polite & full of suggestions, the atmosphere carries a sports memorabilia theme & serve yourself with napkins not soft drinks tho was new but I can dig it as long as they will please speed up the cook times on the Xtra crispy orders. Hey now, don't get me wrong, this is a great scenario if you are with freinds or family kicking back with no rush. But definitely call ahead if you looking for a quick lunch on your break or hungry as a mofo! 
Wingstop is one place where you don't want the wings to stop coming to the table, Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place...? Thumbs up. ..staff is awesome (very friendly), service is great (they let you know what you ordered going to take a few extra minutes). Clean.."}
{"text":"Love the food. Tonight the music was to loud. To vulgar. Couldn't hear yourself talk !"}
{"text":"By far the worst service i ever got wings were dry when asked to remake them they refused I'm just going to go to my usual place for wings is ATL WINGS LOVE THEM BETTER SERVICE THERE"}
{"text":"My son likes their wings a lot but I haven't tried them so I can't rate them.  I just ordered fries and didn't care for them at all because the spice mix they toss on them has sugar in it.  Next time I went in I was prepared and asked for my fries unsweetened.   Much better."}
{"text":"This is an old favorite for me. I always get the Louisiana rub and Lemon Pepper. No fail. Prices are good and it's close. Service is awesome. People are super friendly and quick when I order to go."}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had are here. They have loads of choices in flavor as well as strips and sandwiches. Reasonably priced too. Been to this Wingstop many times with no issues whatsoever. Usually get the 30 wings, fries, and veggies. I think it's $24.99. Give or take. Love this place."}
{"text":"Yum, YUM, YUMMAAS!!

Located near Krispy Creme Donuts. Known to be the place where groups come to watch the games - especially super bowl!!

Last night was the first night I ordered wings (\"on my own\") from this spot. The menu wasn't difficult to understand - I wanted wings and a lot of it. Luckily my cousin had a to-go menu at his place so I looked before hand before coming (since it was 11:30pm). 

My cousin would bring the Louisiana Rub, mango habanero and Garlic Parm home and it's the three bursting with flavors that turned me addicted to the wings. 

I ordered the family pack mix and match - 24 wings (8 mango habanero - 8 Louisiana rub and 8 mild), a large fry (switched it to twisties), 3 dipping sauces and veggie sticks. 
My boyfriend and I went over board with this order and ended up having a bunch of leftovers after. 

Mango habanero - let it cool down and it won't be as spicy spicy. I couldn't handle it burning my lips so I know to stay away from the Atomic flavored wings. But it is still delicious!! 
Louisiana Rub - oh my goodness... The crunch gets me going back and back! The flavor is great! 
Garlic Parmesan (had it a few times before) - at first when I opened the box it smelled like seafood drenched in garlic sauce but once I bite into it I am reminded that it's chicken. If you don't mind seafood then you're good on this dish. 
Mild - eh. Not a fan. It was okay. L

Their meat on their wings are actually a decent amount , unlike some places that sell wings. Customer service was friendly and helpful with questions I had. 

Definitely coming back to try lunch specials!"}
{"text":"I think this place has the best boneless wings in ohio they are sooo good.  It is an independently owned franchise, but the owner is always there working and is a great guy he always remembers his customers too.  They have a few table and some sports tvs also.  They have draft and bottled beer also."}
{"text":"Friendly people that work here. Took my boys here because they were craving some wings. Food came out great but they could have been a bit more generous with their veggies."}
{"text":"I like the wings.  The fries are ok too.  I just want more sauce choices."}
{"text":"New Years Eve. The plan was to grab a 24 pack of wings 12 rolls and a large seasoned fry. Go back to my house watch the fireworks on the strip and end out 2017 and begin 2018 full and happy. Did that happen? Yeah but it had some slip ups getting there. I ordered the family pack for 28.49 (bone in) about a week prior to the time I needed it. Considering it was a holiday, pick up was easy and the wait wasn't long at all. She called out our order named off everything in the list, it all looked great we drove home and set up to eat. The first bite of the wings were absolutely atrocious. The chicken wings look like they were genetically altered (like the skin was tough to eat, the wings were gross looking sort of like someone just cut them off a bird and dipped them in Hawaiian sauce) . It was so hard to eat I only go through two out of twelve before I just had to give up. Called them back and told them the situation. After being on hold for 10 minutes the supervisor (who im sure was very busy) got on the phone told us to bring the bad wings back to get some new fresh ones. She said 20 minutes they should be ready.
 
20 minutes later I grabbed the bad wings to go exchange them for the new wings. I assumed when she said 20 minutes that the wings would be ready, not 20 minutes come up here wait another 10-15 minutes and then receive the food. On an awesome note not only did she replace the wings but she gave us extra fries at no charge. She was super nice and helpful and it wasn't a big issue replacing the wings. The bad part is that by the time I got finished with the whole process I lost my appetite completely. The wings were better by far but I was so disgusted by the appearance of them, the previous experience of eating tough wings, and the sauce being more gelatinous then saucy I just gave up hope on eating good food into the new year. Oh well. I won't go back. I'm turned off by the food, thankfully the service was up to par and that goes a very long way in my book."}
{"text":"I had a just OK experience here.

They kept messing up our order, and then it took a while for our complete order to arrive.

Nonetheless, the wings were a decent size & tasty. I still prefer to get my wings somewhere else due to their sauce selection, but I may go to Wing Stop every now & then to change things up."}
{"text":"The employees are extremely kind and helpful. They gave us a complimentary meal when it took 20+ minutes to get our food. However, the food itself is not good."}
{"text":"Thank you Manager Dana for the excellent customer service received on our first time at this location.  Absolutely love the Lemon Pepper Wings.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I think this place has a lot of potential. The wings are really good. I wish tho that they would have a description underneath each one of the flavors offered because I was a little hesitant about my flavor of boneless wings.

The college special for about $8 is a good deal too. The staff was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place for anybody looking to relax at a sports bar alone, or with a group of people! Thnx:)"}
{"text":"I stopped coming to this place because they were skimming a couple of wings every time I order. I went back today to see if they changed. I counted my wings and it was missing a few. I even paid the extra $2 for all flats. I don't like being the irritated customer. You've lost my business, Wingstop!"}
{"text":"I called to place my to go order. Mind you it was one 3 strip combo, not some huge order. They said it would be 13 minutes. 27 minutes after I called, I finally got my food. There was one person waiting in the restaurant. So again, not a super busy time. When I asked why it took more than double the time, there response was, \"well he might have dropped it late\". This is a frequent problem at this store. It's frustrating. Their food is good but you shouldn't have to wait 27 minutes to get your lunch! Especially when you are in a time crunch!!"}
{"text":"I called my order in for 2 dozen hot wings. I waited about 4 min on hold. Arrived to pick up my order and waited another 30 min!!! 
Wings are so-so and you are charged for sides of ranch. 
Long wait times tho!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this wingstop location. The staff here is super friendly, even when the restaurant gets really busy, they keep their cool. I'm usually served quickly, and if you're the type of person who hates waiting, you can just call in your order. The restaurant is always clean, including the tables, despite there being no trashcans. They also have 4 tvs and they're playing different channels, incase you're not a die hard sports fan."}
{"text":"MMM MMM GOOD! 

I love wing stop I always get the same thing every time I go here, I get there Parmesan Chicken Wings w/ xtra ranch and a side of fries and a sweet tea. MMM the wings are ORGASMIC in my mouth very mouth watering and delicious! The fries are different like no other there sweet and always fresh and I love there ranch i could drink a gallon of it! Never had bad food from here, I love this place! 

Only complaint is every time I order its a 20min wait at least and its pretty pricey for fast food its about $20 bucks for two people to eat here but deff worth it =)"}
{"text":"We ordered the family meal of wings, that came with three different flavors, carrots and celery, and seasoned fries. The customer service was friendly, fast and efficient. The wings were cooked crispy and tasty. The restaurant was clean and neat. I would recommend this location for anyone searching for a good wing place as you won't be disappointed. Law enforcement eats there too. Usually when law enforcement eats at a restaurant it's because it's a good place to eat. This location definitely cares about their customers and they aim to please, this is a sign that the management knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"I go here as the buffalo wild wings near university shut down and I hate driving 10 miles to the nearest buffalo. They don't have a lot of flavor options. But all the ones I tried are good. Louisiana  tub is my favorite."}
{"text":"I'll start of by saying usually they do okay. This time however, my order had to be resent ( I got delivery), so I ended up waiting an extra hour. I get the food, and while theres way more than I ordered, only two things were correct, and what i did get wasnt even good. I called the store ten plus times, to no answer. Manager called and offered to make it up for me though."}
{"text":"I called in an order around 11:15pm to be nice enough to give them some time to get it done before they closed. We arrived about 11:30 and they told us it would be about 10 more minutes. Understandable. 12:00 comes around and we still don't have our food that we CALLED IN AHEAD OF TIME. Come to find out our food was sitting in a bag on the counter the whole time. No surprise that the wings were cold and the fries were soggy. When we asked them to remake it they told us they had closed the kitchen for the night. Worst experience yet, but I'll probably come back cus the food is good. P.S bring a jacket cus it's -50 in there"}
{"text":"Last night was the first time I ventured into a wingstop.  My friend and I ordered the 20 wings.  She had it plain with ranch and I had Garlic Parmesan.  The plain was delicious.  The garlic was not so good.  Will try it again and have something different next time."}
{"text":"1. Very spacious parking
2. Workers are very nice and friendly. 
3. Very patient with big parties. We had hosted a farewell dinner here, and they reserved us a whole section for almost 30 people. We stayed later than the closing time and the workers were still very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wingstop is always good! Nice employees and good food. Very clean restaurant. Order online ahead of time so you don't have to wait!"}
{"text":"The wings and sauce were good but seemed to be way overpriced.  Also, the actual size of the wings seemed a little on the small side.  I do love the soda fountain with 108 combinations though.  Since I've found out that BWW has a \"drums only\" option, I don't think I will be coming back to Wing Stop."}
{"text":"Will not ear here again.    Chicken strips were so greasy I had to wring them out on 2 paper towels."}
{"text":"I would like to let you all know that you have a wonderful manager over at your location 641 Mark street I hope i am spelling her name correctly. Beht was very helpful and patient when handling my issue. I would recommend you all to my family and friends because of her great service. I tried to leave this on the Wingstop website however it would not let me submit my feedback."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this location as they cooked my chicken to perfection. Great atmosphere & friendly staff. Manager Sampson displayed great customer service. Location is a little hard to find but worth it especially right after a good movie @ the AMC across the way."}
{"text":"Visit this location for the first time and it was pretty much a good vibe. They told us that it would be a 20 minute wait but it didn't take that long. The food was hot and delicious. The staff there were all polite. Fair warning if the item has five chillis that means that sh** is hot lol lol"}
{"text":"S/O to Mama Deb for hooking my class and I up with a delicious lunch! The quality of the boneless wings were exquisite and the delivery time was speedy!!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest dirtiest place I have ever been to. The employees could not care less if they get ur order right. The tables were so disgusting and tacky  that my hands stuck to them. When they handed me my tray of food, the bottom of the tray was dirty and sticky.   How has the place not been closed down by the Health District?  Filthy"}
{"text":"This location is absolutely horrible. The screwed up our phone in order on several parts. The people there showed very little interest in customer service. Hell, I tried to keep an appetite as the large woman working the register had her boob out. This was the first and last time we come to this location. We will start going to the Craig location again.
Also, the cut the military discount here to 12 wings. You are either all in or out."}
{"text":"Why do the wings  taste so bland ?? Argh!!! Can't we get any good food in this side of town ? Put some sauce on them wings"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service! Excellent flavor options. My reasoning behind not giving 5 stars, the wings are a little smaller than the competition down the street...that said, they are slightly less expensive so that's fair I suppose! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today. I don't see what all the complaints are about, but maybe they had bad service or something a couple years back. The guy that served us today was quite nice, patient, and helpful. He even offered to let me try the serrano sauce without my asking him. 

The wings were no bigger or smaller than any other wings I've ever had, the sauce was really good, and they were hot and fresh. I wasn't a fan of the fries. People have commented that they are soggy and coated with table sugar. I think them not being crispy is on purpose (you can select \"crispy\" on their web site), and I don't know that I tasted sugar on them. They seemed way, way salty to me. 

While we were eating several other customers trickled in and I didn't see any of the people working there being rude to anyone. 

Overall I thought the wings were good, the fries just aren't my speed (and I don't need the fries anyway), the store was clean, and the staff was friendly. I'll visit again."}
{"text":"I love wing stop! Their wings are always yummy and fresh! They give you various flavors to choose. My favorite are just simply the mild and Parmesan wings. It's also convenient for me to order online."}
{"text":"To be honest, I mainly only come to Wingstop on Mondays and Tuesdays because of their 60 cents boneless wings. Wingstop is a delicious food place, but I'm a cheap person who loves deals so... Yeah!

I've tried the original hot and lemon pepper boneless wings. They're seriously amazing. If you haven't tried them, well.. You need to. I intend on trying all the flavors. I have a long way to go though. Heads up, the original hot flavor was too hot for me and I love spicy foods. I'm afraid that I won't be able to handle the other spicier flavors haha. I still want to try them.. Anyways, their seasoned idaho potato fries are the bomb. Those fries are another reason why I love going to Wingstop. 

If everyday was Monday and Tuesday, let's just say I'd be here everyday. 

Wingstop is the best!"}
{"text":"Horrible Staff, especially cashier Brianna. Completely got our order wrong then gave us attitude and argued until we showed her the receipt. No apology given just a bad attitude and bad service."}
{"text":"DO NOT ever, EVER come to this particular location. Terrible service, staff doesn't seem to know what they're doing or how to do anything in a timely manner. Waited an extra 20 minutes after getting to the location at the exact time my order was supposed to be ready."}
{"text":"Love the food, but we come here for wings AND beer. Unfortunately they dropped my favorite iPa from their draft list."}
{"text":"Sam the owner runs a tight ship the wings are crispy and delicious. I stopped here every time I'm close and I'm glad. I recommend the Louisiana rub and the potato salad. The brownies are excellent too."}
{"text":"We are usually very happy eating at this Wingstop. But today we were very disappointed with how clean this location was. The location was not busy at all, yet many of their tables were dirty. The tables remained this way for well over an hour.  While the employees focused on less pressuring dutiRegardless, the food was very good and was ready in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Very rude cashier, jaylena . She could not get my order correct over the phone after repeating it mutiple times. She then reported it would be 10 min but when i arrived 10 min later she said very rudely, it will be 10 more minutes, its not ready. They need to train on better customer service"}
{"text":"I'm soooooo picky and I put my order in for a extra well done 10 piece all flats with extra seasoning and when I say my order was perfect everything I asked for and I truly appreciate that cause u usually have to wait for my order to be made 2 or 3 times and I've even been told they can't cook it for 26 mins but if I'm willing to pay for it don't tell me what you can't do or won't do. I will be returning to this location very often !!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been very happy with this place. We know what others might think we are crazy and do not know what we are talking about, but we have different standards than those people.

Yes, we have tried all the wings here, but we have our favorites, they are the original hot and lemon pepper. Of course, the fries (crack fries) they are very addicting to us, so we have nicknamed them that.

If you are looking for a sport bar out of Wing Stop, then you are coming to the wrong place. If you are looking for a family place to eat, this again is not the place. If you are looking for food that is fun and tasty, then yes this is the place to come to, and of course all of our boys enjoy all the food here, usually we can not get enough for them as they can eat all the wing we give them and more.

Overall, the wing are tasty and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Wingstop is a great place to get your wing fix and the prices are not bad at all. I usually order the Louisiana Rub and get the ranch side. It's deliciously spicy and always love a dry rub instead of the wet sauces.

Only bummer is service is normally slow to get your wings but assume this is because they make it to order. Being close to work and decent in pricing makes this place a good place to check off if you're looking to quench your wings fix."}
{"text":"So disappointed the last couple times. I put my order in online. Showed 30 min later and nothing was ready. Which I can forgive but not to have all of my order after waiting 20 min for you to get it together.  Maybe it's just this location."}
{"text":"They had my food sitting there before realizing I had been waiting about an hour. Every time I have ordered wings, they always provide the ranch. I get home and they forgot the ranch. Honestly guys, I shouldn't have to check. Won't come back."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at a wingstop. Placed an order online @ 9:40pm and the email I got back said they would have it ready at 10:06pm. I figured they get busy at times, so I'd give them a few extra minutes. I get there at 10:20 and I see they were not busy. 1 group of three was all the facility had. I pay for my order and the girl asks for my receipt. They had not even started my order. Waited for my order as it would take \"8 minutes\" per cook. Didn't leave with my order till 10:41pm. Not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Wings were good, nothing special but they were fine. Hubby and I ordered half lemon pepper and half original hot. The service was good. Workers did their job. Overall good experience. Not the best wings I've had but certainly not the worst."}
{"text":"Ok ive passed this place is a whole bunch of times but have never went inside , tonight I was ready to get my mouth set on fire so if I went all out I started with the blazing wings ,the mango habanero, asian zing, and topped it off with desert heat 

If your not into really hot spicy food do not even attempt  to do what i just did. I started with the hottest 1st and I took a bite into the blazing wing it was perfect it made my baby lips tingle and set my mouth on fire what I was able to take it like a man . And proceeded to eat about 4 more back to back w no problem, since my mouth was on fire I washed it down w some blue moon beer . Perfect combo, I moved onto the mango  habanero and was no problem I really like this one as a fav, next was asian zing little mild for me but flavorfull and desert heat was perfect to end everything , I all the wings and it left me wanting more so I ended up ordering another ten more different type of wings I will say that I will be back to satisfy my spicy mouth hunger but I know my butthole will hate me in the morning"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need to dig into a basket of wings and indulge a bit.

I love love their lemon pepper wings...I usually order them boneless but I like both. Their french fries are also pretty good as well.

Service staff is quick and friendly. They make their wings when you order then so it'll take 10-15 minutes for your order to come out.  

Wingstop is my go to spot when I'm craving chicken wings ^*^"}
{"text":"The boneless wings were good! I really like the mango habanero sauce. The traditional wings were really fatty and the skin didn't have any crispyness to it.  Fast delivery through eat street (only way to get delivery is through the eat street website I believe)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed we always go to this wingstop but today the customer service was horrible we place an order over the phone and we got there to pick the order and when we walk in no greeting or nothing than we stand there for like 10 minutes and they were just talking to each other then I asked I placed and order over the phone is my order ready? N they just look at each other like they were lost... Very good food but the customer service there SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love wingstop, I mean LOVE wingstop. There fries are amazing and the seasoning is great. The lemon pepper wings are the best thing in the world. But when I went to the wingstop on trop and Decatur, my opinion changed. I brought a friend who has never been to wingstop. We order our food and sit down. The girl behind the counter looked like a beat up mess but that doesn't matter   the chicken was about to be bomb. My friend notices his band aide is falling off his finger and he's about to get his hands messy eating some chicken wings. So he decides to go ask the front for a band aide. The lady he talked to happened to be the manager and she told him \"no we ran out\" in a very rude tone. Me and my friend have both worked in many of restaurants  and know that every buisness has to have band aides and a first aid kit. Not only is this a big health issue but also a huge legal issue. If I was really a douche I could have called the health department or even a lawyer. But I'm writing this review for a reason. So while I'm waiting for my chicken to arrive my friend has to go to Quedoba next door and they gave him a bandaid no questions asked. Whoever the manager was at wingstop around June 17 need to get her shit together if he hopes to further her career in the management industry."}
{"text":"I like to squeeze a lime wedge on my hot wings to add a touch of acidity but they never have any when I come here. I don't understand why they would provide lemons but not limes."}
{"text":"Im just going to cut to the chase.

HAIR IN MY CHICKEN AND FRIES. VEGGIES WERE ALL WHITE AND CRACKED.

I was disgusting, I honestly dont know what else to write. This shouldnt even be 1 star, it should be 0."}
{"text":"Great quality food for cheap. I cheated on buffalo wild wings with this place and I'll never go back. 

I always fall in love with the limited time flavors but the loisiana rub is delicious. Right amount of heat and seasoned perfectly. 
Fries are great; fresh and seasoned well. Perfect with their ranch! You can get the fries mixed with any of their dry rubs! 

This location has great customer service. It's clean and quick!"}
{"text":"I'd been here once before and the food was alright, but i thought i'd come back and see if it was any better. Needless to say it wasn't. The service sucked, the wait time for the food wasn't even worth it, it took basically 20-25 minutes to make 8 wings and fries which when given to me didn't come for dine in as i ordered, but instead was given to me in a to go bag even though i wasn't taking it to go. Lastly, not only were my wings hard to eat but the flavor i got made me feel nauseous. Don't get the garlic parmesan flavor unless you're okay with your wings basically being tossed in melted butter and drenched in grated parmesan cheese. It's not even a sauce! I could sprinkle parmesan on wings myself at home if i wanted that. Bottom line, I probably won't be returning after this."}
{"text":"Im not a big fan of eating late night, but luckily my roommate bought 30 piece wings from your store. A typical Friday night in Champaign means people go out or stay in to drink, my roommate who just got up after drinking too much called your store. I was right beside him when he called and he was too drunk to talk normally so he ended up talking so slow just to be clear. When the delivery person called, I picked up his phone and went down directly to get it because he was puking in the bathroom. First thing when I opened the lobby door is a yell from the delivery guy. He called me inappropriate things and started to point the finger at me while talking gibberish. At that point I am not sure if he is the delivery guy or not. The only thing that persuaded me that he was the delivery guy is that he was holding a paper bag with your logo on it. I told him that I'm just a friend who help take the food but he doesn't trust me and decided to corner me and talked trash about my race. I explained to him how he got the wrong person but he doesn't seem to care. Luckily the security in my apartment made him leave. Such a bad service especially it was a tough day for me that day."}
{"text":"Wings were sooo good! I had the lemon pepper & mild boneless wings. I ordered them well done & for delivery. When they got delivered they were still crispy! Plus, they were perfectly sauced. Not dripping in sauce to be soggy & not too little that they had no flavor. Never had Wingstop before. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is nice and relaxing, prices are good and service too!! This wi be my new wings/finger spot and that's with out mentioning that PBR beer is only one dollar every day!!! 

Cheers!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't care how good the wings are...when you have to wait 30 minutes for an order of wings there is no excuse! You have 3 things on the menu for crying out loud! How long does it take to fry some wings, are you killing and butchering the chicken in the back? TOO expensive and TOO long of a wait.  The only reason they get 2 stars and not 1 is because the wings are half decent.  But I'd rather go to Hooters where they are they cheaper and faster!"}
{"text":"Placed an order from GRUBHUB and everything came correctly and delicious! I ordered the lemon pepper and original hot both were in good quality and still hot! I will definitely suggest the Lemon pepper its a dry rub but they are very juicy!"}
{"text":"Treated myself to lunch. I had a 10 piece combo teriyaki & garlic parmesan wings with fries An a coke. Was really good."}
{"text":"Ordered online at noon for an afternoon pick up. I get there, they ring me up and even repeat my order to me. Wait about 15 min, only for the guy to tell me they NEVER MADE MY ORDER. I ordered at 12 PM, for a 3PM pick up, made me wait 15 MINUTES after confirming my order, and they didnt have it. 

Told me they can have my order ready for another 17 min wait. These guys are comedians."}
{"text":"Orders the crew pack which consists of 40 wings / 4 flavors and 4 dipping sauces 2 large fries and 2 veggie sticks. All for only 40 dollars.  Their cheese sauce is the best with the fries. To top our meal off we finished with a triple chunk brownies. I was stuffed."}
{"text":"The food is fine. 

The wait is forever.  Do NOT call while u are on your way there.  You will be on hold forever.  Once i was already in their parking lot from the rio before they answered.  

And that includes the 5-6 mins just to walk room to car.   This is every time.  Maybe hire someone to asn the phone?

Today I was on hold 11 mins.  Took screenshot of the wait.  I prob won't be back."}
{"text":"UPDATE and rating increase: After pleading from my kids to go back, I did and was pleasantly surprised! I ordered sauce on the side and no charge or hassle- and, had great service, smiles and two employees asked if I needed anything/how's the food- l'll return.
My initial review in fall 2015: Boo on Wing Stop and their \"new registers\"- asked for sauce on the side and they now charge $1 for that? What? I can't add my own sauce? Walked out, won't be back and too bad, actually like the food.  poor management/owner who decides a $40 wing order isn't work the $1 for sauce on the side..."}
{"text":"Still my go-to comfort food place!
Some locations, such as Craig, have authentic sweet tea. 

Great variety of sauces, made hot, usually very fast. Family packs are a great deal. The twisters are awesome, I get those instead of fries. 
Best ranch sauce! Order extra."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Amazing wings. Tried the new fried corn, they where literally half the size of the ad photos.
Pretty tasty though.
Love the Louisiana rub and Original hot."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday afternoon for some grub. We love wings and have heard about Wing Stop before so we decided to try them out. We got 20 traditional wings, 3 ranch and an order of \"veggie sticks\" for $21.50. There were quite a few people in the place when we got there, approximately 9 others not including ourselves. Their orders came and went but ours took a good 20 minutes to prepare. I'd say for the wait, it wasn't really worth it. I wasn't impressed, unfortunately! The wings were sub-par and the \"veggie sticks\" were just sliced-up old celery stalks. The best part of it all was their ranch sauce... It was herby, which I like. All in all, I'd have opted for a different spot for lunch had I known-they're basically a \"fast food\" version of Buffalo Wild Wings. Yet, B Dubs knows how to make wings for this girl!"}
{"text":"These wings are crispy and tasty!  They're juicy on the inside and cooked perfectly.  The Luisiana Rub and original hot are awesome.  I'm a huge fan of hot wings and these are excellent and you can choose between the drums or flats or boneless.  you can mix and match the flavours and the meals are a great value.  you will not be disappointed.

The wings take exactly 17 minutes to make so order by phone to eat in and get there in time to pick them up from the counter and chow down.  Highly recommend these if you love hot wings."}
{"text":"Being that yesterday cleveland was hit with the storm of the century, we stayed in and ordered some take out. We're a keto household so options were limited. 

We ordered 30 wings. We got 10 garlic park and 20 Louisiana wings. 

First, the place was an absolute mess! Like trash all over the place. We went to the counter and were legitimately ignored for almost 10 minutes. Apparently, the staff had more important things to do. Like, speaking to several of their friends. 

I waited as long as I could, then I startes to become agitated and aaked to speak to the manager. The gentleman behind the register, rolled his eyes and said. He ain't here. Finally, we were helped when I told my husband I wanted to leave. 

We paid $35 for 30 wings and 2 sides. When we returned home. Everything was cold. 

The wings had a good flavor, I would suggest getting a variety of different rubs. I won't be returning again as the unprofessionalism and dirtiness of the place, bothered me."}
{"text":"Bad experience. I ordered online to avoid the wait, went to the register to pay and after about 15 minutes I asked if my order was ready yet. The cashier had never communicated to the kitchen that we were already waiting there. My order was also missing an order of fries and a female who seemed like a manager apologized and fixed my order. Another 6 minutes later, same manager that was counting the cash register realized we were still waiting there and had to bag and serve the fries herself despite at least 6 other employees just sitting there! Overstaffed and yet here we are waiting on an online order. Thanks for the cold food. As for the food, wing sizes are pretty good, lemon pepper had best flavor. Honey mustard sauce was delicious."}
{"text":"1) Small wings without very much meat

2) High prices (shockingly high when considering the size of the wings)

3) Bad service.  Marcus, an employee, refused to give me a cup of water when my mouth was burning from the wings.  I could purchase a bottle of water or a cup of soda.  What about putting tap water in a soda cup?  I'm dying here!  Nope, that's going to be $2.10.  

I'll be going to Wings Over Madison next time I'm feeling like I want a chicken wings."}
{"text":"I am a happy camper since there is finally a wing place in the area. Awesome concept for Wing Stop, definitely trying to put that competitive edge to BWW. The inside is smaller than what is looks from the outside, but still pretty spacious with bar and dinning area. I ordered the boneless with buffalo and Parmesan garlic and side of Cajun fries. The buffalo was pretty standard, but from other Wing Stops I've had in the past this Parmesan garlic was just okay. The seasoning on the fries was rather strong and almost not good. As much as I want to like the food here I can't exactly say it was good and I'd come back again and again. Although I did have some left overs which tasted better the next day?! Kind of funny I thought. I will give them a few months to work out the kinks and hopefully the food comes out better. I for sure will order the wings since wings are always better than boneless anyway. On the plus side service is good as other Yelpers mentioned."}
{"text":"This incident happened early last year but I wanted to post it anyway. It was a Saturday night and my husband called to place and order for pick up. It was only 9:30 when he ordered and the restaurant was open until midnight. We got there about 15-20 minutes after placing the order and when my husband tried to walk in he found that the doors were locked. Seeing how the entire place is visible due to the windows for walls, he tried knocking to get the employee's attention. Even from the parked car where I was at, I could see there were employees inside and even two people at one of the tables eating. No one acknowledged him so he tried going to the side door and that was locked too. He kept knocking and no one looked over. He got back in the car after 5 minutes of this awkwardness and called them from his cell and they answered right away. He asked them if he could just cancel his order since he was standing outside and no one wanted to open the doors for him. The employee just said, \"Oh, okay. Bye.\" And we left. 
It was honestly weird and unprofessional and we haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get, charge extra if you want ranch, beer warm..... Never coming back. :("}
{"text":"The lemon pepper wings are my favorite. This location set up is really good to watch sports game. I still think it's very over priced and the fires are a little soggy.

The soda machine is the best machine ever!"}
{"text":"The wings served here are excellent. They don't have an incredibly large sauce selection, but the quality of the chicken is much better than other wing places. That said, it can be a bit expensive! They have a really fun soda machine, and that's definitely a plus. (I will be a return customer anywhere I can get peach soda for sure.)

They are usually very busy, though. Almost every time I call I have a hard time getting through. I have to call multiple times for someone to pick up, and when someone does, I immediately get put on hold."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place yet - it's probably because this is my favorite wing place to get wings! It's hard to review your favorite.

The wings here are awesome. The meat is a good quality, the sauces that they have are really good, and the fries that go with them are delicious. I love to get the classic hot wings, or if I'm not feeling spicy, I go with parmesan garlic. The parmesan garlic isn't a greasy sauce, it's more of almost a dry rub. My husband loves their spicier sauces (spicier than I can handle) and says they're pretty good. 

The fries are seasoned really well, the cajun is a nice spicy option, but the seasoning on the regular fries is what gets me. They're perfectly salty, but also has a hint of sweetness. They're best if you eat them in the restaurant, they get soggy quickly (but are heavenly when eaten fresh). 

I eat here once every few weeks, usually calling ahead for pick up. This location has yet to mess up an order, they always give accurate time estimations for pick up, I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for wings, and the service is friendly. The wings are absolutely worth it for the price, and this summer they had a few special deals going. (So it's worth it to ask if they're having any specials.)"}
{"text":"Love this store. Friendly employees from the front of the house to the back :) good vibes!!"}
{"text":"Their smiles and the quality of their service will keep me coming back. 

The food was served hot and fresh and their online orders are prompt. Despite the error of having forgot my second order in my latest order they were quick to make up for it and prepared my food to go in no time! They have awesome vibes and the staff seems happy. It makes the food good! Hickory Smoke and Louisiana Rub 8 pcs. So good. Thanks Wingstop!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why Wingstop gets bad reviews!

 I have always loved wingstop wings better than any other wing places I have tried. There are so many wing sauces to choose. I have tried them all. My favorite flavors are hot, garlic parmesan, and lemon pepper.  Love the French fries and the cut of them. Their ranch is amazing and I feel like the ranch can either make or break the wings and fries.
 I have had very slow service in the past and that was the only bad thing I had to say! This time I had amazing service.  My husband kept changing his order and was making the order process very confusing. I was very surprised by our cashiers attitude!!!! Instead of  Genesis, our cashier getting upset or frustrated she smiled and politely took our order!!! Wingstop still remains my favorite wing spot!"}
{"text":"Ordered Hawaiian chicken hubby ordered lemon pepper. Both were delicious and staff and manager were very kind and professional thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First understand I discovered WINGSTOP in 2015 while in Wisconsin. I fell in love with Lemon Pepper, yum!  Then I found Louisiana Rub and found heaven. So when I ordered my go tos and they weren't up to standard, it was a disappointment to say the least. I ordered late an hour before close so that may have played a factor. My Louisiana run weren't even coated. They tasted like regular wings with no flavor. Boooo!  So I'm hoping my next visit (no matter the time) will be wingstop delicious!"}
{"text":"This place just opened so I stopped in.  It was dinner time and there was only one table occupied. Ordered the wings and seasoned fries. It was a long wait considering I was the only order they had to work on.  There were 4 workers standing around the fryer waiting for the wings to get done. Got home and a few of the wings was soggy on one side and wasn't cooked thoroughly. The fries are the only thing worth going for but I don't see this place staying around long.  I do like that they give you 2 sauce choice on the wings but I chose the Parmesan which was bland and the Louisiana Rub is quite spicy for being on a medium scale."}
{"text":"I was never a big fan of chicken wings.. 
I know.. I know.. blasphemous... but all of that 
changed when I was introduced to Wingstop...
Their lemon pepper is hands down the best in the
city. 
Ive tried other peoples wings and theirs are usually 
too big to enjoy, we've all seen em.. the wings that are as 
big as breasts... yeah Im not a fan.. or too soft...
I prefer my wings crisp.. 
And wingstop fulfills all my needs.. bite sized and 
crispy skin.. Delicious from head to toe.. 
I will absolutely be back.. !!"}
{"text":"Wingstop is my favorite Wing place. I'm pretty much exclusive only to them.
Lemon pepper, fried hard, Best way to go..! 
I'm particular to this location because they have curbside service. Thats the best thing about this spot. Its typically busy so the staff is a little less than friendly but eh.. im here for wings.. not friends..!"}
{"text":"Best wings out of a franchise ! Way better than Buffalo Wild Wings in my opinion .. Customer service could be a little better but the food is great and good price"}
{"text":"This location is larger then most and the service is better too. It has 10 TVs and a bar. Good spot to watch Monday night football."}
{"text":"I am a chef myself and I would never serve a customer broken fries, nor did I see any food handlers with gloves?"}
{"text":"Charging  $1 per extra ranch when it's only a 3oz portion cup is ridiculously overpriced. Especially when it's a family pack of 50 wings and sides. Give you 4 to start with for 50 wings!!!! Spent $50 on the meal to begin with, you would think they could throw a couple in for larger orders."}
{"text":"The fries are good and so is the chicken tenders. They also have a small but good choices for drinks. I don't really like any of the wings here but they have good fries. The place (tables and chairs) felt kinda stinky. But the food was ok"}
{"text":"Many wing joints around me but I choose this Wingstop every time! Order online and pickup promptly without fail! Their customer service and the quality of wings is tough to beat. I like to read other's comments on Yelp and notice that people like to complain about EVERYTHING, hahaha. \"Too salty, too small of wings, the employee wasn't paying enough attention to me.\" The staff at this store have been nothing but awesome and quick and efficient and the wings are perfect so keep it up! Can't please every crybaby! Whenever you're craving the crispiest, savory and most meaty wings and you're nearby don't hesitate to order in advance and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, and they always know what I want. I order from here almost every week and they know exactly what I want when I call. They have amazing wings and my favorite are the Hawaiian wings. I love this place and my only advice is too call ahead before you order. Sometimes, the place is packed and it takes a while to get my food but if you call ahead it helps out a lot."}
{"text":"Big fans of Wingstop, even more so since they opened up by our house on Charleston and Rainbow.  We do not eat chicken fro anywhere else, and unless the go out of business we never will.."}
{"text":"Awesome wings and close to home. My favorite are the hot ones, my daughter likes the garlic - parmesan and the service is great. Lots of smiling faces. Got to love that."}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan of this place. I love wings so I was excited to try it out. They were out of the flavors we wanted so we settled for something else. I ordered the Garlic Parmesan and one other flavor. They didn't look too appetizing and tasted okay. Needless to say, I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is crap !!!!!!!! The guy there is super rude his name is Julio ! I went to order some wings with my family and 11 and told us we are not allowed to eat there cause he was going to close ! Th manager is shit there"}
{"text":"Rude employees, high prices, soggy fries, slow service. 

I was double-charged for an order once and it took 7 days (and several trips back) to finally get my money back. They acted like it was my fault it happened. I also placed an order online, and when I went to pick it up the order slip was still sitting on the printer, and I had to wait 25 additional minutes for them to make the order. No apologies, no compensation for the inconvenience. Just bad service. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place some credit. The staff was super friendly and efficient, the wing were big, crispy and delicious- we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Leigh,  the cashier was too busy talking to what looks like a employee? I'm not sure the guy was wearing a tank top and had a baseball cap on in the kitchen. I waited 5 mins to be greeted, received no apology for the wait. She didn't tell me how long my order would be. On top of that she didn't bother to thank me stoping by wing stop.  What a bad restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed in my Louisiana rub boneless wings today... :( but America helped me out in correcting my situation with no problem, so I'm very much happy, but this isn't the first order I placed here and my wings came out not the usual way I order them. My last order at this location was the same way. Please take note on how Wingstop Sports does their LA rub boneless wings. I still rated 4 stars because of America.... still love Wingstop. :/"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, because it does cost a bit, but I can't wait to go back this weekend (payday!). I get the boneless 8 piece bbq style with a large cheese sauce to go with the fries too! Always great tasting food & decent service too!"}
{"text":"Not only is this place OKay , at best they just can't seem to get your order right no matter what you do , if you request \"light sauce \" it will have extra , if you say no sauce it will have sauce , you ask for hot sure enough medium , and then on top of it get a attitude and act rude when you say something about it . Go anywhere else I mean anywhere and you will be happier then here !"}
{"text":"Service was great. That's where it ends. The place was FILTHY!!!!   No trash can, unless you count the floor. Not a clean table in the place. Workers in the back yelling at each other. The glass in the front door was so dirty you couldn't see through it.  Music so loud you can't think. The ONLY reason this wasn't a one star review is because the young man who took our order was polite, funny, and helpful. HE IS THE REASON FOR THE TWO EXTRA STARS."}
{"text":"This is a great Wingstop. I stop here for lunch at least once a week. The staffs here are super friendly. The restaurant is very clean. My orders are always accurate and tasty. The only downside is this place can get really busy. Ordering 20 minutes before your arrival is probably a good idea. Definitely a great place to satisfy my cravings for good wings."}
{"text":"i'm not much into chains but this place is awesome. good wings, good deals, and the ambiance is cool...they have plane memorabilia everywhere lol and i think the way they offer paper towels is pretty neat too...u just get as much as u want coz those wings can gt messy. the only thing i dnt like it they charge for the dipping sause when u want extra, but i guessed this is there way of cutting down."}
{"text":"I am a wingstopaholic, when I eat wings I eat wingstop. Having ate here almost weekly, sometimes multiple times in one week, I can say with confidence that it is consistent. The food is consistently well prepared, and I think the secret is the guy in charge. I regular this location although it's further from me than other locations because the management ensures that their product is always as expected, great!"}
{"text":"I love the food! Love they cajun sauce very nice thick wings! I been coming here for about two years and its true the services is not the best and all i see its bad management! I know its the employees but if they really care they would train their employees good before put them at front. Hire more people becouse btw refills to go orders and walkin ins Its a very busy a location only a few time been there and got a good service and food. Most of the time they are behind orders and be rude. So if you going in just be patience I still love the food."}
{"text":"Some of these reviews kill me.  People go to a wing place and order chicken strips, or get some random sauce they didn't like and blame the restaurant.   

Now for what to expect:  I never have/will order anything but a chicken wing from this place and I'd recommend you don't go here unless you want a chicken wing.  Also, it is more setup for a smaller lunch/dinner crowd and I imagine they get most of their business from take out orders.  Lastly, they cook the wings to order which take 15 minutes to prepare.  'Nuff said.

Now I have 3 reasons I love this place.  First, their wings are cooked to perfection.  They are juicy and cooked just enough to have that perfect crispness one should except from a chicken wing.  I've never had them screw it up the many times I've been there.  Second, their fries are delicious.  They remind me of boardwalk fries which you don't get around here much and they put what I think is a salt/sugar seasoning on them which is excellent.  Last but not least is their sauces.  While oddly bright red their regular hot flavor is well done.  The garlic parm is simple and delicious.  And my favorite and the most unique is lemon pepper.  It is oddly tangy and I can't figure out how they do it.

They aren't cheap but I think you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Upon arrival I was starving and craving wings! Hello, Wingstop. Never been here before so I didn't know exactly what to order. The girl at the cashier helped me through the menu onto the perfect combo meal with fries and a drink. Did I mention I got greeted by their whole staff at once when I walked in? I felt welcomed, like I was having lunch with friends. Now let's get to the food, it was so fresh and came out piping hot! I didn't mind waiting either. Quality food is my number one reason to eat out. This isn't just fast food. I would recommend all my friends to come:) 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online, person who.greeted us was very nice. Got home chicken was horrible, hard and either old or overcooked, or both. Never had a bad experience with Wingstop and this was the 1st time at this particular one.  I ordered the Louisiana Rub and they forgot to rub anything on my wings, only rub was on the bottom of the container. Will never go to this Wingstop again"}
{"text":"Ok, I heard so much about Wing Stop so wanted to try. I tell you this, don't get the boneless wings it's a no go the taste, the texture...I was not impressed at all & will not get it again. Then the rolls, they made it sound good to get the rolls. Another failure the rolls are so dry and taste as if it was the frozen type you put in the oven to warm up, no butter or anything. I was so disappointed. Maybe it's just this location on Losee."}
{"text":"I come here once in a blue moon for their always hot and fresh chicken wings. Located on Spring Mtn. and Rainbow Blvd, same plaza as Walmart/Sam's Club. 

SERVICE
Hit or miss. Fortunately I got a very friendly server on my recent visit. Other server on the next register over looked like she was ready to murder someone. 

FOOD
I always get their boneless chicken wings. They have 6,8,10, or 12 pieces options for the combo which comes with their hand-cut fries and 21oz. drink. My 6 pieces boneless chicken wing combo came out to be $9.72 with tax included. 

They have 11 flavor options with various spice level. I don't like anything spicy so I tend to go towards the bottom of their spice scale. My favorites are their garlic parmesan and lemon pepper. 

They make the wings fresh to order so there is a wait, usually around 20-30 mins. You can order online or call them for pickup to minimize the wait time.

*It's odd that this place doesn't have a trash bin anywhere. However, employees here are constantly checking and cleaning the table so leave all your trash on the table lol

CONCLUSION
Will be back but will use online/phone order next time."}
{"text":"Love wings.  This is a reliable spot for me especially when it gets late in the day.  

I usually get the 10 piece combo, traditional.  Flavors would be original hot and BBQ.  The pieces are bigger than bite size, flavorful, and comes out steaming hot.  

I just discovered the buns!  I was never here for the buns but the butter topped buns are so delicious.  I'm gonna start drinking alchy with my wings and buns."}
{"text":"Lately, our family has been on a wing kick.  I have no reason why, we just all of a sudden over the last two months have been craving chicken wings.  There are a number of restaurants here in Las Vegas to satisfy that craving.  Seems like nearly every chain includes them on the menu in some appetizer form.  But what if there was a restaurant out there that ONLY served wings?  Ingenious!  There's a few out there, but our first try was Wingstop.

We actually have two locations within our neck of the woods, but one Wingstop location is located in the Santa Fe Hotel & Casino.  Went to this one over on Craig after hearing they had the ubiquitous choose-your-own-flavor-combination Coca-Cola Freestyle machine!  Selling Coke products in itself is reward for me!  I could sit there for hours thinking what to drink next.  I need one of these things in my house.  Along with some insulin.

Entering the restaurant is nice enough, lots of green, white, gray, and I like the dark wood.  Definitely gives off a sports bar vibe.  And sure enough, multiple flat screen TV's spread throughout the dining area all showing some sort of sport.  Sweet!  Eat some wings, watch some football!  Darnit, why Wingstop don't you serve up some beers!  Would be perfect!

Wingstop offers three main kinds of chicken:  classic wings, boneless wings, and boneless strips.  Boneless wings and boneless strips look almost the same, except that boneless wings are shaped more like wings (duh).  All get the same treatment though, a ride through the flavor train of one of Wingstop's 10 different sauces!  Toot toot!  You have as your choices (from mild to hot):

-Teriyaki
-Hawaiian
-Garlic Parmesan
-Lemon Pepper
-Hickory Smoked BBQ
-Mild
-Louisiana Rub
-Original Hot
-Cajun
-Atomic

We haven't tried them all yet, but so far our faves are the Louisiana Rub, Lemon Pepper, and the Original Hot.  Finger lickin' good!  I know there are some reviews with complaints about their wings not done properly, and of course this can happen.  Lucky for us, our wings were cooked just right - moist and juicy on the inside, slightly crunchy skin of the outside!  No pink in the middle for us.  We tried the classic wings and the boneless strips.  I must say, even though the strips are a bit meatier, I prefer the joy of eating a classic wing.  They originated in Buffalo for Christ's sake....they are called BUFFALO WINGS!  Yeah I just stick with the classic.  But I'm sure kids out there might rather have boneless wings or strips.

Not only do you get your chicken dragged through sauce, but you can also opt for a dip.  Your choice of either a container of Ranch or Bleu Cheese, Honey Mustard, or Hot Aged Cheddar Cheese.  Original Hot wings with a dip of Bleu Cheese?  I'm set.

Wingstop offers a variety of combo meals to fit your needs.  You have individual combo meals, meals for two, and even family packs.  If it's just the wifey and I we go with the 15 piece wing combo meal for two.  If it's us with the kiddies we opt for one of the smaller family packs.  Good thing about these is that we can choose wings, boneless wings, or strips, or a combination of all three.  Everyone can be happy.

Wingstop also has a number of sides to choose from:

-Seasoned Fries
-Veggie Sticks (carrot and celery)
-Bourbon Baked Beans
-Cheese Fries
-Yeast Rolls 
-Coleslaw
-Potato Salad

I like the seasoned fries and the veggie sticks.  Here's a tip though - ask for them to cook the fries longer!  Sometimes they pull them out a bit early and you end up with soggy fries.  Disaster!  I tend to like mine more on the overdone side.

Prices are ok, about what you think it would cost for chicken and fries.  In the range of about $8-$9 for an individual combo meal.  You get a bit better deal on the combo meals though instead of a la carte.  Reason I had to knock down Wingstop a star is because the service is hit-or-miss.  One person helping you may be great, but the person next to them might be downright dreary.  Hey chica, if you don't want to work there...leave!  Massive unemployment and mouths to feed means someone will gladly take your spot right away.  Just sayin'.

Wingstop.  Stop...for wings!"}
{"text":"Voooodoooooo fries are to die for! And their wings ofcourse! But I'm in love with their fries , I've never had a problem with this location they've always been great ."}
{"text":"This is the absolute slowest wing-stop in the history of slow! Customer service is horrible. The staff will see you standing at the counter and not say one word to you. 

There's only one person that acknowledges customers while the rest act as if they have a bad attitude. I've been here when there was no one at the counter and appeared to be not many orders at all and it still took 20 mins to get my order. Worst restaurant experience ever! Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment. Best wings. Fuck BWW. Mon & Tues. 50 Cent wings. Best flavors are Original Hot and BBQ. Damn good !"}
{"text":"I tryed this place because I had been hearing such good things about it but I don't understand what the hype was about my food wasn't good both the fries and wings were bland"}
{"text":"Solid wings and solid service.  Not a bad lunch spot.  Wings are always cooked fresh so its usually about a 15 minute wait for your food."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for wings!  The staff is friendly and attentive. The location is clean and convenient. And the wings!  I am now a lemon pepper addict!"}
{"text":"Delivery was a nightmare!!!!
Wingstop is definitely preferred over B Dubs and Hooters in my book but this location has some issues! We ordered lunch for an office of 8, using the delivery service. Little did we know delivery is through nightmare of Uber eats! The entire order was supposed to arrive at 12:15. Two orders arrived about 12:20 with little to no labels. A follow up call was placed about 12:30 that only 2 orders were delivered, no details of what 2! The employee appeared shocked and said they would follow up with the Uber driver. After several fails to get the latest update due to a busy line or placed on hold finally after 1 o'clock  they state they're remaking the food - with no detail of what's missing!! An estimate of arrival was asked and the employee? shouts out how long then replies 8 minutes 15 minutes later remainder of order arrived again with little to no labels. Either the remainder of the order was not given to the \"delivery\" driver or the driver brought it back! Either way there is a ton of room for improvement with the delivery service. I suggest a better channel of communication for starters, considering your outsourcing. Also don't lie and say your remaking it when you don't know what was delivered! Food just sat somewhere for over an hour. Ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great either.  On the rare occasions that I get Wing Stop, it's because it's closer to me than Buffalo Wild Wings, but honestly, the latter is much better.  I've only ever had the boneless teriyaki wings at Wing Stop, so I can't comment on their hotter sauces or bone-in wings.  My main problem is that there's always WAY too much sauce.  Yeahhh, I know, wings aren't the healthiest choice on their own, but my poor little chickens always come DROWNING in teriyaki sauce!  Every time I have them, I have to literally mop up the extra sauce with a paper towel.  Beyond all that, the fries are okay, but they have this sort of weird, sweet taste that I'm not sure if I like.  Overall? I'd go with B-Dubs instead."}
{"text":"Girl on the phone mocked my voice cuz I mumble
I'm a little angry tho cuz she didn't even sound like me!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time today. Wings were great and fresh from the fryer (unlike Bdubs!) and fries were solid, though my husband thought his were too salty (mine were Cajun). Earned a spot in the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I gave them two star just because of the service (staff). This place can easily get a five star but the customer service needs an overhaul.
Food is great."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery twice in the last week.  Both times the bag was packed with the boxes on their sides to let the sauce soak through the bottom of the paper bag.  The first night the person handed me the bag and awkwardly walked away.  Tonight the guy handed me the bag and put his hands in the air like it wasn't his fault.  I called him out and he said \"that's how the restaurant gave it to me.\"  Apparently he works for some other company that delivers for them called Eatstreet.  He then went on to say \"I didn't mess with your food, I promise\" which begs me to ask...why would he even say that?  And furthermore...why would he take a bag from the store that's soaked through?  He couldn't get away from me quick enough.  But seriously...the paper bag was disintegrated and the wings were about to hit the ground right away.

So yeah.  This place is low on my list and I can assure you I'm posting this on every site I can.  I've done takeout twice and the service wasn't much better.  It's a shame because the food is halfway decent."}
{"text":"I ordered online and everything was easy but the. I waited at least twenty minutes after my promised time because the incompetent workers just put my food on the rack to get cold instead of calling out my name like they did with every other customer, I will not return again. The wings were mediocre at best and she didn't even give me my drink while I waited for my food, terrible customer service and a terrible place I will not patronize again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the greatest wings on planet earth. I've  tried wings at every place imaginable, and always end up wishing I'd went to wing stop! So now when I want wings I always go to WS."}
{"text":"Fries were not fresh.  Chicken was OK, but not great.  Service really slow and didn't ask if needed anything.  Prices are a bit high for just wings.  I've been there 4 times so far.  It's about the same every time."}
{"text":"Lunch today was from Wingstop. Myself and two co-workers decided to call our orders in since the online ordering requires a credit card payment. 

I went with the 10 piece combo, boneless. I was allowed to choose 2 wing flavors, I went with Original and BBQ. The combo also came with fries, which I decided to swap out for potato salad. I also got a side of ranch dressing and a soda for $6.99.

The order was ready when the employee said it would be, that is a plus. When we got the food back to the office, the first thing I noticed was the lack of any kind of marking on the outside of the containers. All three had to be opened to see which was which. 

I've had better wings. And potato salad for that matter. Maybe I would have been happier with other flavors? The original was fine, had a kick to it but not too hot. The BBQ is also fine, a little sweet, but I personally prefer a bit more tang to my BBQ sauce. I tried some of the fries my co-worker got and definitely regretted making the swap for potato salad. 

I will probably try Wingstop again on a later date, but I will certainly order differently."}
{"text":"Yes, we had Wing Stop for lunch.  And Yes, I am reviewing this place. 

Located near UNLV and in the same parking lot as Seafood City, Wing Stop is one of those places where they're known for just their wings and sports bar type feel.  We had lunch here because we wanted something quick, didn't want to drive too far from Seafood City, and needed some protein. There's protein in it chicken, right?  We ended up sharing 12 pieces of their boneless Garlic Parmesan chicken.  Taste wise was okay and this got me realizing that I should have opted for their plain boneless chicken.  Service wasn't bad, but the food did take a little longer than expected.  As for the restaurant, it's spacious with enough TV's playing ESPN.  My biggest issue, that was an immediate turn off for me, was the smell of mop water upon walking in.  A clean towel to wipe down the tables would have been nice, just saying."}
{"text":"This is my favorite wing place in Madison. Staff is friendly and the wings are always made to order...should I repeat that THE WINGS ARE MADE TO ORDER. Always fresh and their fries are yummy too. My personal favorite is the teriyaki bone in wings and they aren't shy with the sauce like some wing shops. Parking can be a bit tricky since its on reagant street downtown Madison but generally you can find street parking somewhere near the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was happen to see this back in the neighborhood, but the longer this place is open the worst the service is. Why place an online order if I am going to have to wait 30+ minutes for my order to be ready? That is not pickup service. I ask a question, and the female with the terrible attitude ask for the name on my order and never answers the question. Wings have always been great, but more frequently I hear others bringing  their food back or expressing immediate dissatisfaction. Previous manager demanded and delivered professionalism and perfection on all orders and interactions, but I have not seen him in a while. This is a neighborhood spot so my family  has frequented this location before the renovation of cedar center, and now. This place unfortunately is getting to become more of a hassle to continue patronizing."}
{"text":"The wings were overly dry.  I don't understand how they can screw that up when there was a table of 3 done eating.  No one waiting for food when I walked in, and 1 carry out order called ahead.  Students were gone so it's not like the campus was buzzing.  The original hot wings are Tabasco flavored which is weak, UN-inspiring, and unoriginal.  The cajun wings had the cajun unevenly sprinkled on.  The fries had a very odd sweet taste to it.  I couldn't place it at the time, although it seemed familiar.  The only thing worthy of note was a large helping of bleu cheese came with the wings."}
{"text":"Wings were small and priced too high. Need organization. Great sauces for wings. In location where most restaurants sell wings at lower prices."}
{"text":"As a fan of wings and fries, this place is a pretty good spot to eat at. I've definitely had better wings, but I've also had worse. Nothing really great or different about their food that would stick out compared to other places, but I still like it. Very close to my house and is located in the same parking lot as Seafood City Supermarket. 

Pros:
1. Customer Service has been great every time I've been there.
2. Clean tables 
3. Drink station has always been filled  whenever I've gotten a drink.
4. Food came out in a timely matter.

Cons:
1. Several times that I've been to this location, their ladies room has been dirty and not stocked with toilet paper. 


I always get the traditional wings with the fries. The fries are really good. Wings at time seem to be small and hardly no meat on them. I'm not a big fan of how they season/flavor their wings. It's like they cooked them and then just threw on the flavor at the end. I like wings cooked in their flavor. Also, their wings are super greasy, especially the Parmesan ones. 

Not a big fan of sports, but this place has lots of TVs with sports playing all the time for all the fans out there. They also have a bar, which I've never used. Actually never got any beer at a wing place!! Overall a pretty good place!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time in years and had a great meal... wait takes a while (15 minutes) but 10 wings and season fries came fresh out of the fryer... lemon pepper was good as always, mango habanero was OK (BWW is noticeably better).  Fries were crisp and seasoned great.  First visit = 4.5/5 stars.

Came here again because of how much I enjoyed it and got the same order but with lemon pepper and teriyaki this time.  Lemon peppers was good... as always... teriyaki however was absolutely horrible.  The flavor was hardly sweet or tangy enough, and it kind of just tasted like flat barbecue sauce.  The fries, as many mentioned were extremely soggy and browned out, rather than the golden-yellow I received last time.  Second visit = 1.5/5 stars

To be fair, I averaged the two and it gets 3 stars.  Coming here will be a gamble, but I guess if I'm in the area again and am in desperate craving of wings, I will take my chances here (at least the lemon pepper will always be reliable)."}
{"text":"I called in to make a pick up order and Candra was very helpful and sweet . Upon picking up my order Steve seemed to care . He asked how my day was , either he noticed something was wrong (a jerk stole my parking spot , me and kids had to seek elsewhere , and that jerk was in line to ordered before us) or he is doing an amazing job . Overall great experience , these are my favorite wings for a reason !"}
{"text":"Our food is always so fresh and delicious when we come here! I love this Wingstop. Spicy Korean is my favorite!"}
{"text":"30 minutes for 10 wings that is ridiculous never coming to this location again and 2 wings weren't even fully cooked could barely bite into them."}
{"text":"Love the wings here! I always order the classic wing with the bone in, personally better than the boneless but it is what you prefer! I definitely think they are better than Buffalo Wild Wings and they have the best \"hot\" flavor and \"lemon pepper\" flavor in town! Their fries are also very fresh and salted to perfection, I usually get ranch or honey mustard to dip them in- the chipotle dip is gross! Most the time you get a free dip with your meal or 3 when you get a family pack, if you don't it is a $1!! That's just to expensive! Lastly the coke machine is awesome, if you haven't seen it, it is very high tech! You can get all types of drinks and mix them for example coke you can add vanilla, cherry, vanilla cherry, lime etc!!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't great. Gotten wings to go twice and reached this conclusion.

The establishment itself is nice enough. Seems big. It touts itself as being a place to watch sports, but it doesn't seem to have enough TVs or space to really do that. The cashiers have always been nice enough. The place is nice enough.

The wings. For a place called wingstop, they really don't have that many flavors for wings. It's about 8. And even with that, it was hard to pick as it wasn't a great 8. And if you are not a fan of dry rub like I am, I guess you are out of luck. Your choices drop down to about 4. 

The flavors left a lot to be desires. Garlic Parmesan, you would think would be a nice cheese garlic rub...but it's really just slathered in sauce and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. It just seemed weird. I could buy a container of Parmesan cheese and sprinkle them on wet wings. Original hot barely has spice and the wings were dry. Hickory Smoked BBQ was slathered in BBQ, but then it was too much. BBQ was bland and again wings were dry. Hawaiian though was decent, had a nice pineapple flavor with being overpowering. Side note: Spicy Chipotle sauce is not worth it as a dipping sauce. Feels more like a cheese dip than anything else. 

The wings are just sub-par, There is a debate between bone-in and boneless but this is the place where boneless is definitely the way to go. You get more meat and the meat is juicier. Usually boneless wings are bigger anyway, but most places, the bone in wings are juicier and taste better. This place just doesn't have that.

Fries were also very dry and apparently has sugar sprinkled over the fries. Pretty much everything is dry. Might need to spritz some water of everything, it could use the moisture.

I would suggest B Dubs if you wanted wings and to skip this place."}
{"text":"Always satisfied with every wing. I would say that they  have shortened me one wing and was too lazy to have to go back... oh well, I'll still eat there lol"}
{"text":"I have decided to update my original review. After leaving this place completely unsatisfied and upset I contacted management where I was greeted by the GM Theresa. I explained to her what had happened the night before and she was just as taken back by the behavior as I was. She asked me to come back in and she accommodated my son and I for the experience we had the night before. While eating our food, she came to check on us more than once but also greeted everyone else in the restaurant and checked on them as well. She apologized to me more than once. I'm going to chalk last nights experience up to one employee having a bad attitude but overall I'm pleased with the way I was treated after meeting Theresa. Theresa treated me with compassion and you could tell she takes pride in the way she runs her team."}
{"text":"so happy I don't have to go to Chinatown for Wingstop now that this one is open! Brand new and cleaner and yummier than the other ones around! Also I recommend ordering online or from their app so much faster and easier!"}
{"text":"This app will not allow me to rate them in the minus so i have to give them one star (not by choice ).  The cashier there Odalys lacks customer service skills and is down right rude, not to mention the manager on duty who came to talk to me when i asked for a manager. ... omg this joke of a  manager by name Javila is the reason the employees act the way they do.. Javila was beyond rude,  condescending, unapologetic, highly aggresive, defensive and even tried to put the blame on another employee who she clearly had a problem with as she yelled at her to clean the mens stall.. im writing this review because this so called manager would not give me a higher manager's name or number when i did not want to further waste my time with her. I will dedfinately let ALL my family and friends know about this place so that we never come here again."}
{"text":"New location!  Tonight included a 10 piece Classic Combo.  5 Garlic Parmesan and 5 Original Hot wings, fresh made French fries and Blue cheese dressing.  

Service was good from this new staff.

The inside and kitchen were spotless.

Everything tasted good and as you would expect from any other WingStop location."}
{"text":"My favorite wings. Lemon Pepper with Fries, Blue Cheese Sauce, and one drink from a huge soft drink or tea selection.

Still, my first choice for food, at this price, is the original Volcano Grille on Durango and Warm Springs.  But, Volcano Grille is amazing Teriyaki!"}
{"text":"Wing stop is a place where you will get the same standards no matter the wing stop you visit. It's not the best I ever had but I know where to go if I want good wings every time and in any city I see find a wing stop in"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Wingstop in years.  I decided to try their lunch combo which is 5 boneless wings, a side, and a drink.  Not bad for $5.99.

The wings, however, were soaked in grease, and very salty.  There was a little pool of oil at the bottom of my basket.  Funny thing was that my wings were dry, as if it was never coated in the oily mess.  Also my side of fried corn wasn't the greatest thing.  It was overcooked, and again oily and salty."}
{"text":"Food here is always amazing and fresh. 
The max wait is 18 minutes so we usually call ahead so it's ready when we get there. I read another review that complained about the wait, but there's no way their food would be as good just sitting under a heat lamp. 
No thank you!!
I drive the extra few miles to come to this location because the food taste better and the employees are always super friendly. 

Also, if you get the traditional wings you can request all drums or flats."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! Best Wings by far. Way better then Buffalo Wild Wings and the service is great. Everyone is friendly helpful and the all always have that smile on. Now you may have to wait for a few from time to time especially Friday or Saturday night but knowing this going in it really ain't that big of deal."}
{"text":"Very patient staff, helped us order EXACTLY what we wanted. The atmosphere is cozy and family friendly for the whole family! The Friends theme song was playing when we walked in, good vibes. Absolutely fantastic food and service."}
{"text":"I love the Louisiana rub & the garlic Parmesan wings !  Love their ranch dressing, makes everything taste delicious ! ;)  The soda machine here makes you want to try all the different sodas that's available (except the diet Fanta)."}
{"text":"Either the online ordering system needs work or the employees need further training on its application. I placed my order through their website and when I arrived at the specified time the staff said that there was no order placed for me. I was passed off between staff members for ~10 minutes without so much as a \"sorry for the confusion\" until finally the manager came and figured out that they did indeed have my order in the back. No apologies or attempt to make up for the confusion, the manager just blurted \"Here it is, that will be $25.10.\" This place needs to revamp its attitude towards it's customers and learn how to implement some common courtesy. 

Wings were dried out, not particularly meaty, and lacking in flavor. Their classic buffalo sauce, which should be the hallmark of a wing centric restaurant, was totally off. The only saving grace was their seasoned fries which were delicious and perfectly crispy. 

I wanted to give only a single star but figured I would add another to compensate for the negative bias which their ordering and service problems likely caused in me. 

Won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"We ordered a 15 wing piece have bbq half original hot and they ended up messing up the order by giving us 4 BBQ four Mild and we ordered all flats and got a mixture , we went back again to fixed the order for home come to see they messed up again gave us 15 BBQ , by far worst experience I've ever had with wing stop ."}
{"text":"Today I went into wing stop after placing a big order over the telephone. After picking up my order in the time frame they told me it would be ready over the phone I noticed that the order was incorrect and my fries were soggy. I kindly asked the manager on duty Jasmine if she could redo my order or drop my fries again. Jasmine was very unprofessional  and rude and told me that it was not wing stop policy to redo the order even though I was not satisfied. I then asked for a refund and she replied that I was 4 minutes outside of the pick up time and wing stop does not give refunds or replace orders. She was getting loud with me in front of customers. When I asked for corporate number she replied that she didn't know it. One of the other workers told me to look on the wall. When my friend came into the store to talk about how that was not right, Jasmine replied to her \"it is what it is\" which made my friend upset because we are very loyal customers and spend at least 200 a week with them. I'm not sure if this is how Wingstop handles its customers but I felt disrespected. I did call customer service and they informed me that the district manager will call me and refund my money. It's sad that one person can make an entire corporation look bad and I hope that they train their team on effective customer service skills and how not to be rude. This was a simple fix and did not have to be escalated to the point where the on staff manager took it."}
{"text":"White lady eating pasta and making wings at the same time behind the counter, smh. Didn't wash her hands either. She was the manager too. Yikes!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Nasty!  

The floor and tables were covered with grime and dirt and I'll start there.  There was grease spots or whatever the nasty on the picture frames, indicating that someone went tazmanian devil into the wings.

I literally saw the fries get re cooked.  Seriously, i thought these were supposed to be cooked to order.  The wings were also terrible.  The amount of Na+ in these wings was enough to cure meat in Alaska over the winter.

The staff needs to make sure they have clean gloves, not touch their phones with the gloves, and clean the bowls before just tossing teh next wing order into the bowls for flavor.  I can't imagine how old the wing juice was in some of those bowls.

Needless to say, I tried 1 wing and was done.  I couldn't even put words to what I saw when an employee licked their fingers with wing sauce on it.  I'm not a picky person, trust me, but this was totally unacceptable.

TOO MUCH TO BE DESIRED, and I will never go back:("}
{"text":"So this is my 2nd Wingstop I have visited and I am still in love!

This particular location is smaller then what I have previously been too, but still a great operation.  The staff is super friendly and welcoming.  There is a small seating area and some TVs to watch during lunch.  It is a nice place to grab a fast lunch and be out quickly.

The boneless chicken wings are delightful, especially the Louisiana Rub flavored ones.  YUMMY!  I have tried pretty much all of the flavors and I don't think you can go wrong with any of them.  The lemon pepper flavor is quite interesting though.  I usually get a few of those to go in the mix just because it is such a unique flavor.  I actually had a dream about the boneless wings from Wingstop.  You know it's good when you dream about the food!  I like the fries too.  They have a sweet & salty seasoning on them that make them tasty.

I haven't eaten here, instead I usually put in a huge take away order to bring back to my mom's house.  Yep, that's right, I got my mom addicted to Wingstop and we have had it 3 times in the past month.  Ha ha!"}
{"text":"I just recently found this place and I am so happy I finally gave Wingstop a try.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are big.  They even have a $5 lunch special every day from 11a-2p. The chicken is tasty and the sauces are yummy.  I have tried most of them so far and really enjoy the Louisiana Rub and the Garlic Parmesan flavors.    

It is also a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat.  You can be in and out pretty quickly when you need to be.  If you like sports, there always seems to be something on the TVs.  It has a sporty vibe, but it isn't shoved down your throat either.  It is a fun place to eat.

They have an email club that you can join on their website and get coupons emails pretty regularly as well.  I love a good coupon!"}
{"text":"I come here often and this is probably no fault of this location but the corporation. I placed an order online to avoid this 18 minute wait. Used my credit card only to get here and hear \"we don't show an order for you\" and the only thing I was offered was a cup of water while I wait. Beyond livid and my card better not show a duplicate charge."}
{"text":"The worst chicken wings ever.
Ask for mild got extra spicey
The corn was burnt not roasted 
French fries never happened 
But was charged for them.
Never again..."}
{"text":"I have pretty much come to the conclusion that these wings are the fast food of wings. Not that they try to present themselves otherwise but I just get a very generic feel from these wings.

I will say that the service at this location is top notch. The cashier taking orders was very nice and made sure to clarify what I had ordered before she put the order in. I ordered three chicken strips with original hot sauce and fries with a side of cheese sauce. The strips were just okay. I would not go out of my way to order them again. The fries were the same. The cheese sauce that came with them was overall pretty bland. My true issue lies with the amount of salt that is used in everything here. Way too much salt. It became overpowering halfway through my meal. As one of the other reviewers said, I could also taste sugar in the fries which is just completely unnecessary. 

I'm not sure if I would come back to Wing Stop. There are certainly many other better alternatives for wings in the area. I might consider trying something else here but not any time soon."}
{"text":"Haven't had the wings yet, I will post review for that shortly, however I just place my carry out order and I must say the gentleman on the phone was great! Very polite and perfect customer service! Excited to finally try the wings!"}
{"text":"This Wing Stop is located inside the Santa Fe Hotel in the food court area. Best way to get here without walking all over the casino is to park in the front by registration which is right off Rancho and walk straight back and you will see it. 

I'm new to this area of town so I actually had to ask the lady on the phone how to get there and the best place to park. She was extremely nice and gave great directions. I didn't catch her name but I really appreciated her patience in answering my question. So thank you!!! 

Ok, back to the food. I placed my take out order of a Family Pack with 24 wings, veggies, and a large fry. I'm really weird and always order my chicken wings plain and just get the sauce on the side. So don't think my wings looks weird in the picture. My veggies were fresh and delicious. I actually enjoy eating nice crisp celery and carrots with my wings. I swear this place has the best ranch ever! I always order a large ranch and just use the left over on my salads during the week. 

The only reason I docked this place a star was because my fries were not cooked all the way and still slightly raw. I think they forgot to season them as well. Next time I will just mention it over the phone so they know and see what happens. 

Overall great spot, friendly staff, and delicious food."}
{"text":"The wings are big and tasty.  They meal deal is actually a great value, 6 big wings and fries for $8 (fills you up) and you can get 2 different sauces.  This place is small and there is a bit of a wait, but I've come back multiple times so it's a good place for lunch.

I like the milder sauces like Hawaiian and garlic, but there new seasonal spicy pepper sauce is great too.  The fries that come with the meal are awesome."}
{"text":"I don't come to wingstop that often, but when I do it's because I'm ready for a wingtastic meal. I usually order from the by the piece menu and get the breaded parmesan crusted, teriyaki and hickory BBQ flavored wings and they never disappoint.

You can't really go wrong when you eat here because the the food is always fresh and hot and the prices are more than fair and they serve beer for those who dine in... Now how cool is that?!

The only down side to this particular location is that it's always packed out, especially in the evenings and most of the time you have to stand in line for 15 minutes just to place your order.

I definitely dig this joint and look forward to making my way over when the wing droolfest begins!"}
{"text":"Great wings. Great price. Great customer service. Can't find wings accompanied by this service anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"I've never had the wings but I can say that the chicken strips are the best I've ever had.  I get a 3 or 5 piece (naked) with BBQ sauce on the side and ranch dressing.  The fries are very good or you can get twisters (also great).  Its a very clean restaurant and the staff is top notch.  I go there at least once a week.  They are open late (midnight?) which makes it a great way to cure those late night cravings."}
{"text":"Tried their wings for the first time. I enjoyed them and will be back again. Tried four different flavors. The garlic Parmesan were my favorite with the Louisiana rub close behind.  Not enough heat in the mild for me but good flavor if you don't like spicy. The lemon pepper was not one I would do again as it wasn't strong enough. Just tasted like a chicken finger. Their ranch sauce was very good. 
The restaurant was nice with the sports on all the TV's but it was freezing and I like it cold. It was a little loud for talking but great for watching games."}
{"text":"I put in a phone order for mild and chili line wings and got a box of mild and plain wings. Thanks for ruining my craving."}
{"text":"slow service , giving our order to the wrong table which Thy dipped their hands into the fries and the waiter still brought the order to us ! Wth !!!
Their wings are not that special . Will Never return"}
{"text":"Tropicana and Decatur in Las Vegas they where the best clean  fast and friendly super close to our timeshare we stayed at"}
{"text":"Yummy wings. My fave is the mango habanero followed by a close original.  Workers are nice and super friendly"}
{"text":"All of these great reviews got me to finally go to Wing Stop. Its just kind of a hole in the wall type of place...the name says it all 'Wing Stop' if you want yummy wings that its open late at night I will say this place was very good. I got the 20 classic Wings due to the fact I'm afraid to try new sauces because I have been disappointed in other places sauces so I figured I would stick with Original Classic Wings Hot. They were not too spicy but had a nice kick to them. Tangy wing sauce hot kick. The only reason I didnt give them a 5 is I asked for Well Done and they werent actually crispy well done. But they were still good I judt wanted them Crispy and thats what I asked for. The cashier girl was very friendly and also patient with the people in front of me that didnt speak very good English and she struggled to get their order. The location wasnt my favorite on Tropicana near The Orleans its kind of run down over there but overall everything else was good. Usually its the hole in the wall places that have the best food. I will go back again when i'm craving some tasty wings."}
{"text":"very slow,waiting for over a hour for wings,over price,and the wings was not that good.thumb down."}
{"text":"Cashier was very rude to a customer over the phone when the older lady came in for her order the cashier continued the rudeness. I waited 30mins for 2orders of 10pc wings and fries..."}
{"text":"Good wings with a great price. Garlic Parmesan traditional are my favorite. When visiting this location, it has had some questionable service. Order wait time can take an eternity even when picking up. However, nothing compares to their fries as I would cater them to my wedding!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and the wings were great. They were just the right size and I tried a new flavor Spicy Korean. It had a great flavor but wasn't really spicy to me. Usually when I order wings at other locations I have to order them extra crispy, but I didn't at this location. 

I was very say satisfied with my order and I will return soon."}
{"text":"Wings are good, place is small but clean. The girl that took our order not so good. I don't know if she can't speak up or what but we couldn't hear half of what she was saying. We have to ask her to repeat almost everything."}
{"text":"The Garlic Parmesan wings I ordered were covered in chunks of dry sauce, and the Hot wings tasted like an experiment gone wrong. The chicken tasted alright, but the flavorings made them near impossible to eat. I ended up throwing out half of my meal. By far, this is the worst wings place in the Champaign area."}
{"text":"Best place for wings!! I am so happy I have one so close to me. The Cajun and lemon pepper flavor wings are delicious !!"}
{"text":"I ordered 15 minutes ago, got here, and they just put my wings down and told me that it's going to be ready in 20 minutes.  

Considering that the order was placed well ahead of time and that this is the second occurrence,  this will be the last time I get Wingstop from this franchise.  Terrible punctuality."}
{"text":"Very good wings always order bone in classic. The boneless even though good reminds me of nuggets. One can have many Flavors from mild to nice and hot."}
{"text":"Love Wingstop. Try the citrus Brazilian. One of my favourite flavors. Korean bbq is good too but kinda sweet."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Placed on online order for 9:45 giving them plenty of time because my friend had told me he placed an online perfect there before and they didn't even start it until he got there. Got there close to 10 and they told me they didn't even have the order. I tried to tell them I had my confirmation number and she cut me off and saying it might have went through on my end but they don't have it. The lady did not show any kind of haste or care about my problem. I purposely timed the pick up to be during half time of the cavs game and she made us wait there for about 5 minutes before she finally walked up to take care of my problem. She said she was going to have re put in the order, and my friend asked if they already had some wings ready and she answered rudely \"well I don't know, what is the order?\" I was so upset by the customer service and attitude that I left. As I was leaving I was complaining to my friend and the dude walking out with me said they made him wait 40 minutes instead of 20 and he was missing the game too. Seriously some of the worst customer service and experience I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"I love wings as much as the next girl, but when me and my mother entered this Wingstop the THREE employees were too busy talking and joking to take our order."}
{"text":"Wings...Average

Service.....Not


Ordered online emailed ready in 24 minutes arrived about 20 minutes later. When I arrived there was a rather long line. I looked for the online/phone pick up window and there was none. So I waited in the line. 2 cashiers were working the line. of course when I get up to the line one cashier goes back to the cooks to chat and I kid you not the other answers the phone for a phone order. So of the 2 cashiers one is working the other is visiting in the back and the customers wait. I would have left but I had to prepay since I ordered online. Almost left anyhow. Then when the cashier got off hte phone she took care of my order and I still had to wait 15 minutes. EVERYONE in line before me got served BEFORE my online order was finished. Wings are average but service is not worth it."}
{"text":"Wings were good. Definitely not cheap. Food took 25 minutes from the time of order to service and they forgot our veggies. We have been here for nearly an hour since we walked in and now are about to leave - there have been 3 other customers this entire time. I'll never eat here again unless it's takeout.... good thing they serve beer, you're going to need it for the wait. 

Wingstop replied... they have a standard cook time. Apparently this is 25 minutes?  I can grill a perfect chicken breast in my back yard in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I ordered bone in wings fried hard. They were cooked well, however, half of them had more than a few feathers on them. I'm sure some of the feathers crisped off in the fryer. Nice to know they'd rather save a few bucks and feed a customer disgusting food, than ensure they keep loyal customers!"}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers, right amount of heat, tasty fries, and that Coke jukebox thing. What more can you ask for?  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"2 people working only place had 6 groups in. Waited 7 minutes, and just left.. Hire a1extra person other than 1 person doing cleaning / ice / and cashier...."}
{"text":"Just want write a review on (Anna) she was extremely nice and friendly. Amazing customer service. Like to let management or who ever is in charge she's awesome. Also the place was very clean and staff was very well organized. But Anna's customer service was what impress me the most."}
{"text":"Went to Wingstop for the first time after hearing so many good things about it. Me and a group of friends ordered about 48 wings and 2 large fries. The lady that was taking our order was the very least bit interested in being there, as she was taking our order she kept staring out the window and having us repeat over and over again what we had ordered. Then once we sat down we noticed every time the phone rang she continued to be rude to the people on the phone. After about 20 minuets of still waiting for food the cashiers son came in with her family he seemed to be about 3 or 4, he was just running all over the place trying to jump on counter tops and she just did not have a care in the world. After finally getting our food the fries were so salty we couldn't eat them and the wings were so dry and hard they tasted as if they were hours old. Won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Two small orders (6 & 8 piece) took over 40 minutes! WTF! Good food but not sure it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have returned a few times since writing my last review and am always greeted with a friendly smile from the helpful staff and I continue to be impressed with the cleanliness and attention to detail. This is fast food elevated and I will continue to drive the distance to eat there."}
{"text":"I like Wingstop flavors and their seasoned flies. But the first time, I tried ordering a takeout I found having smaller wings and also less number of drumsticks (I found 2 out of 8). However, its always good when we sit there and eat. The service is good. Everyone should try Mango Habanero, Luisiana Rub, Spicy Korean...:)"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Let's start from the beginning. The person who took my order had an attitude as if he hated his job. I got the 20 piece wings which comes in 3 flavors. He didn't even know that, and looked at me like I was crazy when I told him the 3 flavors I wanted. While waiting, I got to listen to the cooks argue about why the food isn't made in a timely manner. To top that, when I received my food, I was asked for it back because they gave me someone else's take out order. I didn't even get an apology for the confusion. This place needs to step it up."}
{"text":"I realized it had been a minute since I had wings. This place was close and I knew it would be fast. Besides the friendly service, that is about all I can say-fast and friendly service. 

Dry bone-in wings. I have tried 4 sauces here and none of them have hit me as being something I would return for. Their sauces are not hot enough for me. 

If you go here, go for boneless as they are more juicy. I prefer traditional bone-in overall because I am not a fan of breading, but boneless with a ton of breading is the only palatable option."}
{"text":"I used to come here weekly for lunch.  Honestly, it's a bit far from work so I don't come out here nearly as much as I used to.

They have a new soda machine which is amazing.  It's one of those coke machines with the touchscreen and hundreds of combinations of drinks.  Gotta love that.  Except when the old people who don't like technology take their sweet time trying to figure it all out.

The fries are amazing, though I should admit they aren't most peoples style.  They are quite limp (but not soggy).  They have a good thickness which allows you to actually taste the potato.  They salt the hell out of them so make sure you order without salt though.

The ranch dressing here is also awesome.  It's thin without being watery.  Normally I like a thick ranch, but wingstop manages to make a thin sauce that's really perfect for dipping.

The wings (boneless and strips) themselves are about average.  They do have some good sauces though (If doing boneless, I recommend ordering the sauce on the side for dipping).  My personal favorite is the hawaiian.  Beware of the mild sauce as it's really watery/runny."}
{"text":"I've been a Wingstop fan for quite some time now.  My friends and I would got to the Green Valley Ranch location about once a week until it was closed down.  Then we started going to the Tropicana location (although not as frequently due to the location).  We recently found about this particular location on Maryland and wanted to give it a try.

The manager, DJ, transferred from the Tropicana location.  He remembers our names (even though we only go a couple times a month these days) and is always welcoming and friendly.

This location is a bit different than most Wingstop locations.  There is a bar area.  There is more seating than normal.  The walls are lined with TVs showing sports.  I like all these things.  At the other Wingstop locations I would feel cramped and would want to leave soon after finishing my meal.

The wings I got on this trip were exceptionally large.  I've never had a problem with wing size at Wingstop and these were even bigger than usual.  I typically get the hot sauce which has a decent amount of kick.  The wings are never undercooked or overcooked and are quite tender and juicy.

I love the ranch sauce.  It's thin without being watery.  Hard to explain, but it's perfect for going with the hot wings.

They have TWO of the coke machines with the touchscreens.  I love those touchscreens, but people can be slow figuring them out.  With two of them there I hardly saw a line waiting for them.

The only negative about Wingstop is the price.  A small soda, dozen wings, and a ranch cost me over $12."}
{"text":"This is our favorite WingStop location. No matter how busy they are, their customer service never falls below five star. Super friendly staff. Wings are always fresh, orders are always correct whether you take out or dine in.
It's one of the smaller locations, so if you're planning on watching any games inside, get there early!"}
{"text":"I realize Wing Stop is a chain, and those familiar with the brand are highly unlikely to take customer reviews via Yelp into consideration before placing an order here. However, I feel responsible for informing anyone who happens to glance this business that this is location has the one of the absolute worst customer services I've ever experienced. We ordered take-out here a couple weeks ago only to come pick up and the food and be told that the associate \"forgot to place the order. OOPS!\" No compensation offered for time lost or the inconvenience, not a cup of water while my boyfriend was forced to wait, which also left me waiting at my job to be picked up an additional thirty minutes. Giving it a second try this evening we experienced the same epically shitty service as before. We tried ordering the same \"special\" we were offered a couple weeks ago to be told \"oh you want the special? We don't have that.\" Really? No suggestions to other specials you DO have that we're more than willing to purchase? 
With that being said, the Wing Stop off Nellis and Stewart has amazing service by associates who seem very happy to do what they're getting paid to do, might I add, no matter what time of day you're ordering. It is very clear to me whoever is employing the indignant robots in this location cares even less than the workers do about providing quality service. A true tarnish to Wing Stop's reputation."}
{"text":"I only wish this place was closer to me! Fast service. Like that this is a sport bar concept Wing Stop. One negative- have to pay for extra dips, like Ranch."}
{"text":"Love me some Wingstop.  The fact that all orders are made fresh is a plus, it's a little bit of a wait, but if you plan ahead and order then drive over its perfect.  I usually always do that.  I love their wings but lately I've been getting the chicken strips and I'm in love.  Nice and saucy.   Not a huge fan of the fries but that is no big deal to me."}
{"text":"Look, it's wings. It's pretty hard to mess up wings. I love that everything is made as you order it. Nothing is kept under a heat lamp here. Pretty friendly staff. Food is consistently good every time I go here. My only complaint would be that it's a little more pricey than other wing places, and they don't have a large variety of flavors and rubs."}
{"text":"We have only order here once because we ordered boneless and got regular bone wings and they were pretty small. Also the employee I spoke with when I ordered wasn't very courteous. We prefer Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I love this wingstop!  I go to any wingstop I can because it's my favorite place to eat!  This place has the best service of any wingstop I've been to, though!  I love the garlic parmesan wings the most, but the lemon pepper are my second favorite.  The fries are the best especially if you get them with their cheese sauce (I ALWAYS do).  I love wingstop's wings so much my fianc√© and I even ate here for our anniversary!  I know that's kind of ridiculous, but their food is really good!"}
{"text":"Went into this wing stop and will say that I was very happy with the personnel!  She was very friendly, allowed us to taste any of the sauces and checked on us multiple times while we were sitting!  

downfall is that it takes 20 minutes to get even get your food - which is also a plus because it is fresh 

I received fry's that I think were old as they were all limp looking 

i tried mango habanero (favorite), bbq and lemon pepper (fiance's favorite)"}
{"text":"I ordered the the two sauce, 10 piece meal (original hot and garlic parmesan)....they were good, but I expected better from a place that specializes in wings. There are hundreds of places in Vegas/Henderson that serve wings as good (or better) than Wingstop.....so Wingstop is nothing special....but if your close by, and are in the mood for wings, then Wingstop will suit your needs."}
{"text":"This is my first time here my aunt loves this place I will update my order once I try the wings but ! It's super bowl Sunday this place is running behind since they are so busy ! 330 promise time it's 334 we will see how much I get we need to wait ! 

Stay tuned for more

Very disappointed been waiting over 30 minutes seems like they are very disorganized ! 

Doesn't seem like they have any clue how to run a smooth operation super backed up! That's understandable but they really. Need to get this under wraps ! 

I still want to try the wings but we may be asking for a refund !

We finally got our order 30 min late but after getting home and eating the wings they are good ! 

Well the French fries are amazing ! 

Too bad the wait was so long they need to find a better way to service customers appropriately according to order and promise time , but besides the long wait no other complaints 


I would have gave two or one stars but my aunt swears by this place never being like this ! So I will give them three !"}
{"text":"We have always loved coming to this place,1st we love wing stop second the crew were great BEFORE! Now they have changed a lot.I felt like we're the only customer that they don't give a dumb about. I see them serving the foods to other tables with plate included. I had to go and ask them for a plate! Probably because they see us often here that they don't care anymore! But isn't that it should be the other way around? They already know what our needs our we don't have to ask for it over and over."}
{"text":"I ordered online and ordered incorrectly and they fixed it with no problems and no attitudes that's greatly appreciated!!!!"}
{"text":"They completely messed up our order! We drove back to pick up the wings we were supposed to have only for them to be drowning in grease and over seasoned. We ended up throwing them away because it was so salty that you could not eat them. I will not visit this place ever again. I usually like wingstop, but this location is not the best."}
{"text":"Love Wingstop!! Never had any issues other than today...ordered some wings for delivery and was disappointed to see that the containers my wings were in were full of grease! We separated from the container and when my husband took a bite, grease literally gushed out of his boneless wings. Called to talk to the manager and she came off as if we were lying about it. Seriously!! Not that serious ended up having to drive to the location. Inconvenient and the manager wasn't very professional. Double check your wings before they leave if you ordered for delivery."}
{"text":"Ate here twice this week. They cook the wings fresh so it takes some time but worth it. 
Good customer service and clean store."}
{"text":"Nice location for a wing stop since it's literally down the street from my house. Came here on a Friday night for take home- we placed an order with Bryant he asked us to wait 17 minutes. It seemed to be their motto cause he said it to pretty much everyone who ordered. We decide to try their new flavor spicy Korean and he even offered for me to to have a sample. The staff is attentive, friendly, and fast and the establishment is clean. Will defiantly be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. If I could leave no stars I would. Employees were all just sitting around doing nothing on their phones. There was a mix up with who's order was who's and employees rolled their eyes when I grabbed the wrong order. When we did receive our orders it looks like they just threw everything on the plate, didn't even season anything. Probably won't end up going to this location anymore just because of the horrible service."}
{"text":"I love this place the people are friendly and the food is great. They keep the inside clean so it's comfortable to sit dawn and eat. My order was done fast and everything was exactly how we ordered it. We had a couple of special orders but it came out great."}
{"text":"The Wing stop I would not stop just keep driving... The wings were ok and I think a bit over priced for what you get some wings... I am sorry when your bill is almost $20 dollars for wings and fries it better rock. I would have enjoyed the fires but they were super salty this is one stop I will not make again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and awesome customer service! Definitely will be back for more wings made to order!"}
{"text":"Been there couple of times... Once tried the atomic wings ...One of the spicest wing i ever had...Infact was not able to eat more than two bites.. The nedium ones are good ... There is not much service or ambience..Its located at a small place next to frys and people usually tend to miss the spot due to that...The attendants are very cordial.."}
{"text":"Slow a molasses. Only one cook and he can't keep up. People were leaving because of the time it was taking to get their orders filled.

Wings are good, don't get me wrong. The time to get served is unacceptable. This was my second time trying them. There won't be a third."}
{"text":"Best wings in town, they also have a great ranch dressing.  The fries are good and there are several seasonings for the fries, but my  favorite is the cheese sauce for them."}
{"text":"If you have not tried the Lemon Pepper wings and the fries here, you need to stop whatever it is you're doing and go to Wingstop NOW!!  A friend of mine always used to get them and the idea of lemon pepper just didn't appeal to me but one day I felt like something different so I decided to try them.  Once I did I was mad at myself that I hadn't done it sooner!  The wings are perfectly crispy, the balance of flavors between the lemon and the pepper is mouthwatering and the fries are some of the best I've ever had with a sort of sweet and savory seasoning on them that I can't figure out but I'm obsessed with.  The one thing I will say is that if you like your fries crispy you'll need to order them \"well done.\"  If you don't they're still good but a little too soft for me personally.  I also love that they have Strawberry Fanta, it just tops off the perfect meal."}
{"text":"Staff was quick with our order. Came here twice. Nothing out of the ordinary. Yeah, the staff doesn't always have a smile on their faces but neither would I."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON I T.  My food was burned and Pink Chicken in the middle with an 20 minute wait time and the garlic parmigian was shaken out of a Kraft Can . HOW IS THIS A NUMBER ONE IN VEGAS????"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many wing stops across many states. This location was on par. The wings were cooked well and the sauces were delicious. The staff was professional and pleasant. The seating area was also clean and tidy. While this business is not my go to for wings- I can safely eat here and never be disappointed. Being new to the valley I have not found the \"perfect\" wing joint yet."}
{"text":"Maaaaaaaaan listen to me... two words: Lemon Pepper. Make you slap yo mama, grandma, and cousin if they're around. So doggone good."}
{"text":"The employees need to consistently wear gloves. You're dealing with other people's for !!!"}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes for 12 wings and fries. Mediocre customer service. Dirty condiment station that needed to be refilled."}
{"text":"I've loved Wingstop since I first had it in Chicago. This location is really busy. Food is still just as good as u remember it back home."}
{"text":"Excellent service and fresh, hot tasty wings. Can't beat it! The garlic Parmesan wings were delicious, as were the lemon pepper wings. I wanted more..like a never ending mountain of delicious, crispy wings. The fries were good, and super fresh. The portion was so big that two of us couldn't finish it!"}
{"text":"Rude and extremely slow service! 6 people working in the kitchen and 1 on the register with 12 people standing in line ! One line for ordering and pick up ! I ordered online and came at the time that it was estimated to be ready ! Online it said it would be ready at 16:08 and I was finally able to pick it up at 16:25 obviously food was cold already"}
{"text":"I ordered my family meal online with an add on of lemon pepper boneless wings for only 2.99 (pretty good deal). I double checked my email before I left to make sure that the confirmation went through and yup, there is was, so I left to go pick up my order. I got there and the staff was warm and greeted me nicely. The restaurant was clean even though it was pretty busy. I requested my order and showed them my confirmation and they never received it in their system. I had to reorder and wait. I did ask the manager for a discount considering I had proof of my order and had to wait an additional 20 minutes and he was nice enough to give me 10% off for my inconvenience. 

In short, the food was okay. The best part were the delicious rolls and the lemon pepper boneless wings that I just threw in the order. Everything was hot and fresh but not as tasty as I had hoped. The staff was nice and the manager was kind enough to give me something for my inconvenience. I don't know that I will be heading back any time soon but my advise to you is that if you are ordering in advance, do not just rely on your email confirmation make the call and see that they have received it in their system or just call in and order over the phone. 

Okay, but not great."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I just recently tried Wing Stop for the first time and we were not very satisfied. The wings weren't as tasteful as we expected, we were charged $1 for each small container of ranch and the food was very overpriced. The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is because of their customer service."}
{"text":"This Wing Stop has the worst customer service.  I come to this location at least twice a week. And, I have never been greeted with a pleasant attitude by the front register staff. Going back for a refill or picking up food, the cooks are always nice. Management needs to seriously evaluate their choice of up front and dining room staff. Samson is the only up front person to greet you with a smile. 

And, I'd call out the rude employee but he's not wearing a nametag, and, honestly, he'd probably give me a fake name. 

I don't know what they use to clean the tables, but they are constantly sticky. There's a reason we don't take our food off the trays. 

I'm giving this location two stars only because the cook staff actually care about their job."}
{"text":"I went there so much when it first opened and never had any complaints. The service was phenomenal! I stopped going for about two-three months because I was eating there so much. When I went  there recently, the service was HORRIBLE! I was so surprised because the management strived for great service. Almost everyone who was working was new, so that was the problem. The new staff weren't as nice as the previous staff. Randy was still there and he was great! My issue was with the so called supervisor, who seemed extremely happy to have some kind of authority. As I was making my order with another employee, she was taking someone else's order on the phone. I am not sure why Jasmine (the supervisor) felt the need to be in my conversation with the other employee especially since she was on the phone taking an order with another customer. She was so rude! After she hung up with the customer, she began rolling her eyes at me and saying things to me that a supervisor should never say, like when I had a question about my order she said things like \"it is what it is\" or \"that isn't my problem\". She was so rude and I don't ever want to eat there again because of her. Randy, if you know better you'll do better! That little girl shouldn't be the face of Wingstop!"}
{"text":"Really good location! Has a lot more space than most of the other wing stops as far as seating and there are plenty of TVs to keep an eye on your favorite sports etc! Really clean inside and the customer service is awesome!!! The food was prepared fresh and in a timely manner and as always the wings came out delicious!!! I love me some Wingstop and this location holds up the level of quality that I've come to expect!!!"}
{"text":"Was reluctant to try this place based on the poor ratings.  But it's walking distance ftom my office, it was lunch time, and let's face it, I like wings.

The place is nice and clean, check.  The young lady who took my order was mildly peasant, check.  I ordered 10 hot wings, cooked crispy with a side of bleu cheese.  It took about 15 minutes for my order to be ready, about what I'd expect for wings, check.

The wings weren't quite as crispy as I like, but they were still pretty good.  I was pleasantly suprised at the \"larger than expected\" side if bleu cheese dressing that came with it."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but my first experience was not good. Maybe even horrible. My boyfriend loves wings and used to eat here in Texas all the time. He owns a shirt. His love for this place is serious. So I placed an order on line. We like kinda far and I heard they take a while bc they are so busy. So I was cool with it. Places my order and we drove down there picked up food and came home. I should have checked the food but I assumed bc it was online with a print already clear for them it would be fine. It wasn't. I guess somebody else had ordered a very similar order to ours. And they mixed it up. I was upset but they refunded my money back and I was whatever about it. The wings were alright nothing special. It's hard to say how good they were since it wasnt what I ordered. Fries were soggy and not seasoned. My second or third chicken wing I found the longest black hair ever. I stopped eating obviously. This kinda pushed the whole experience over the edge. Even my boyfriend who loved the wingstop in Texas said it wasn't as good. Probably won't ever come back. I only have two stars bc the cashier girl was nice and very apologetic and I got my money back anyways. This place is over hyped."}
{"text":"We did an online order so it would be ready to go when we got there. It was, and the food was yummy! No complaints. We are happy and have full tummies now :)"}
{"text":"They have the best boneless wings around town, lots of sauce, juicy chicken, and great dipping sauces!!! You also cannot go wrong with their fries and dipping them in hot cheese is to die for!!!! Finally, if you are thirsty they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle Machine so you can make and drink you want!!! I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at this place. I LOVE the Lemon Pepper wings....delicious. I also enjoy Louisiana Rub and Garlic Parmesan. This place is always jumping with customers coming in and out. My wings are always made to order and are hot and fresh. Nothing bad I can say about this location."}
{"text":"We Love Wingstop!! Louisiana Rub is our favorite. And the seasoned fries are delicious. Would give 5 stars but due to the fact that I was sweating inside the restaurant because it was 81 degrees inside."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying that I wanted SO badly to give 5 stars here. I attended the Yelp event last Wednesday and the place was amazing. The wing seasonings and sauces were homemade, and very tasty. Louisiana rub and lemon pepper were my favorite. The potato salad reminded me of how my mom makes it, very good. The manager who hosted us was very hospitable, friendly and welcoming. I loved the story and history behind Wing Stop, them landing in Pittsburgh with plans to open 14 locations, and the food overall was great. We took a to go menu because we were definitely ordering from them again! 

My boyfriend and I were hungry for wings today so we grabbed the menu and decided on the 25 wing deal with fries. 3 different flavors, hell ya! We got in the car with the dogs (so they could enjoy a Sunday evening ride of course) and headed down. It started pouring rain on the ride down. So instead of going in and chit chatting it up with the friendly staff, I decided to just call in and not get soaked lol. The girl who answered the phone was friendly, but new, she had to ask another employee what the 25 wing deal was. Hey, whatever, there are new employees everywhere no biggie. Also, the first thing she said to me after I said \"pickup\" was, \"we charge over the phone for pickups is that ok?\" That was a little bit of a turn off for me. But, what I just couldn't understand though, was that she told me it was only for boneless wings. She told me that there was a 30 wing deal with regular wings for a couple bucks more. Now, I love a boneless wing just as much as the next guy but I had my mind set on gnawing on a bone haha. And I really didn't wanna pay for that many wings. I didn't want 30 wings, I don't really like to keep them as left overs and the two of us definitely wouldn't be able to finish 30. 25 is even a little bit of a stretch. I asked if she could please ask her manager to help us out and do some type of 20-25 deal with fries, and she told us \"he said no.\" What place 1- wont let me sub regular wings instead of the their boneless, more expensive counterpart? (Everywhere I've seen mostly has boneless wings more expensive on their menus) And 2- make something happen for their customer? We told the girl over the phone, never mind, that we would just call another wing place. She responded with \"ok, are you sure?\" As far as interactions with food places go, this wasn't the most terrible experience I've had by any means, but I'm all about making my customers happy at my job, I like to be made happy as well. I felt as if the hospitality they preached at the yelp event kinda fell through on this one. I wasn't even offered to pay a little bit more to sub the regular wings (still not ideal) but they probably could've gotten more money from me to give me what I wanted. We will maybe give this place another shot, but they lost $20-$30 bucks from us tonight."}
{"text":"Wingstop never disappoints!! Nice staff, clean place, and delicious food! Just found out about this location which is closer than the other ones we've been to."}
{"text":"Anytime you can order online and cut your wait time, I am a super fan.  I decided to check these guys out for my friends and my \"tradition\" of Monday night football and wings.

Online ordering was a breeze and I arrived ahead of my scheduled pickup.  Definitely greeted warmly and the dining room had a few customers waiting in it.  There was another guy waiting for a to go order... they make everything fresh to order so it's \"#worththewait\".  They have a selection of flavors and being a major chain, I would think they would be consistent at any location.  I experienced them in Chicago since there's a place near where my family lives and definitely thought their wings were solid.

Having the new locations open up in Charlotte (one up in the University area opened about a year ago).  This one opened about 2 weeks ago and I'm excited it is close to Southend.

The dining room has a smattering of tables and you can push them together for larger groups.  They offer more sides than fries:  veggie sticks, coleslaw, potato salad, baked beans, and baked rolls.  Lots of dipping sauces to choose from too.

Staff was super friendly and they were banging out wings and food.  You can totally see the kitchen from the bench you get to sit on while waiting for your order."}
{"text":"I ordered an 8 piece boneless meal. 3 Cajun, 5 hot Togo. What I got was 4 Cajun and 4 mild, which were also incredibly dry. Not happy at all."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed by the service here. They messed up our order the last time we ate here and the manager (Maria) swore up and down she'd put us in her 'red book' (which appears to be a list of credits they have for dissatisfied customers...it's several pages). She neglected to mention that they only keep the records for 30 days and pretended not to remember serving us when we came in today. Kinda sucks being screwed over twice by the same place. It's one of two wing stops on Maryland, guess i know where to take my business in the future."}
{"text":"I have never experienced worst customer service in my entire life! Last night my girlfriend and I decided to head to Wingstop. We got there and a \"Manager\" by the name of Jamilett was sticking to her wrong doings. She took our order incorrectly and once we got back home she told us that we didn't have to come back in she'll have our refund in 5-7 business days. When we got back to their location to either refund our money or just have them remake our order correctly. She told us she would only remake the food that SHE input incorrectly. Problem we had with that is she did it wrong the 1st time and we drove back home which was a collective 1 hour trip making 4 trips back and fourth from the restaurant. She then got mad at one of her new employees for sticking up for us in stating that the customer is right... Let's just remake their food. She then proceeded to tell her she's wrong for going against her and that she's gonna be in trouble. This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Money wasn't refunded. Food was left there. Stay away. I highly recommend that!"}
{"text":"Nope!  Fries were a horrible mess of soggy salty goo. I ordered 12 wings. 2 different DRY rubs and both ranch and blue cheese with a side of veggies. I  received the gross fries, and the wings. No ranch!  No blue cheese!  No veggies! And no napkins!!!!!  Best part of my order was the Diet Coke!  Total failure!!!"}
{"text":"My go-to when I have any kind of chicken wing is typically a boneless wing with mild hot sauce. Suffice to say, Wing Stop can provide me with that when I feel like it. However, I think BWW beats Wing Stop in the boneless category. If you're going to go to Wing Stop definitely get the bone-in. They are massive with lots 'o meat! Very different from most chicken wings.

On my last trip here I went out of the box and got half of my wings mild and the other half the lemon-pepper (it's a rub) and I did it based off of Melia S.'s review. Well, luckily I wasn't disappointed. I really did enjoy the lemon-pepper, but unfortunately my mild wings barely had any sauce on them! Most of the sauce was pooled in the bottom of the container. Kind of disappointing.

I have had their yummy french fries in the past, but the last time I got fries from this location they were kinda soggy and not so good. I guess you just gotta get them at the right time or something. 

Also, and the last thing - their ranch here is very thin, not goopy, and I mean goopy in a good way, like when I have a chicken wing I want the ranch to STICK to it, not roll off! 

Overall Wing Stop is a good fix if you need those chicken wings!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 4 times over the past year.  Each time the place has been clean, the food has been consistantly good.  I love their pototo salad.  I ordered the combo meal 10 wings, a soft drink, and I substitued the fries for the potato salad.  If you are looking for places to eat in the area for under $10 and relatively quick, I highly recommend it.  Oh and even though you don't fill your own softdrink they've always given me refils without charge - a must in my opinion when eating hot wings."}
{"text":"This place is a mad house. I think the core business model is partly to blame. 

First of all, the restaurant is clean. They proudly display their A from the health dept hanging on the wall. 

The problem comes in at taking the customers basic orders. The counter is barely 8ft from the front entry way. 

When they are semi busy it becomes a mad house. You can barely exit the restaurant because there is so many people blocking the entry way. (Poor layout). 

The next gripe I have is for a order/take out type place they are way to slow.

It shouldn't take 25 mins to get your food after ordering. 

If I ever get the food I ordered I'll update this review once I taste my food. Until then I'll keep watching the time..."}
{"text":"$15 bucks for a dozen wings and a drink. 15 minutes after I ordered, and having seen the three people who ordered after me, receiving their orders before me, I approached the counter and asked about my order. They either forgot about my order or gave it to someone else by mistake, because that's when they started making my food. Wish they would have told me about it instead of  leaving me uninformed and waiting even longer, I would have just asked for a refund. Wings were good, especially the korean bbq, but, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Really like the wings, especially the dry rub... very crispy. Wasn't a fan when they combined the wings with different flavors into one container as it didn't taste as good. I just ask for them to be separated now. Not a huge fan of the ranch either, but I usually just use one from home.. always have been nice and helpful inside...
The side of celery and carrots is a good deal also!"}
{"text":"The people here are so friendly! Andrez was our cashier along with who I think was the manager, they were both amazing. The Cajun wings are my favorite."}
{"text":"You know what's awesome.... when u order some food that u know will be good and u get it and it's better than expected.  I have lived in cleveland all(most) of my life and if u want wings. They are always better on the east side. I could have ordered (and I have ordered) the same thing in Brooklyn at the north cliff location and it would have been all messed up with out fail. But they are new, so I'm gonna give them some time. Either way. Wingstop is real. Thank u"}
{"text":"Quick Bad thing out of the way first: 3/10 of my wings were legitimately more breading than meat. I think they should be more conscious of what can be perceived as \"penny pinching.\"

Now, all the rest was great! The attendant who took my order was not only helpful and suggestive but she even brought their Monday special to my attention without me asking. AND she didn't judge me for being too much of a wussbag to try spicy options. What a sweetheart. 

I had both the Hawaiian and the Lemon Pepper options and they were both seriously so good. The Hawaiian was a sweet and sour sauce that was of notable quality, while the lemon pepper was a dry rub over butter and it tasted amazing in a whole different kind of way. I seriously got away with 10 wings for $6. Can't beat that. 

But seriously, Wing Stop... if you get a little infant sized piece of chicken... don't bag it and charge the same amount for it as you would for your normal, plump, proportional ones we travel there for. It's just not a good look. Still love you though."}
{"text":"Wingstop is good on its own *just ask Rick Ross as reference*

You couple that with a lunch that's $5.99 including 5 wings, fries, & a drink? Welcome to heaven ladies and gentleman. 

You have the option of paying an extra $0.50 for a premium side instead of fries and not a single thing you can spend fifty cents on will be of more value than their macaroni and cheese. Trust me. I can never go back to Kraft. Never. 

That special is only from 11-2 so I encourage you make it happen on the weekdays."}
{"text":"I ordered lemon pepper wings . They were hard, dry, and barely had any flavor. Maybe they were having a bad night . But my food was horrible"}
{"text":"My very first visit to Wingstop this week and I've must of gotten a lil lucky based on some of the reviews I read.  We got there around 9pm and our food and service were top notch, was actually surprised how busy they were throughout the night.  Wings were very good along with the fries and cheese sticks.

Will def be back for some RunninRebels away games."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great customer service, food is always delicious. I always order the family pack and am never disappointed today was no exception."}
{"text":"I gave this establishment a chance again a year later and had stellar service. Just a complete 180. Thanks!"}
{"text":"\"Focused so much on the wings, forgot the true focus...*Looks over at the fries and takes a bite.\"
But seriously, the fries are really good and especially the wings. Would recommend to friends and family. Really great eating."}
{"text":"If anybody tells you this WingStop sucks they are lying. I been going to this WingStop for the last 3 years. It is always on point. If you order aga of time (no point not to) you will always have your food ready.  This place isn't that big for eating there so I recommend that you don't. Also, they only have one soda machine which can make the place backed up if there is multiple people. All in all order ahead of time via the App or phone. Wait about 15-20 mins drive and get your food."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch.
Food is always fresh and yummy!!
Staff are really patient and friendly.
The place is always clean.

5/5"}
{"text":"I'm only putting a 2 star because I like wingstop. I usually go to this location and have nothing but nice things to say but this last time was horrible! The fries were so crunchy and it was all scraps none of them were full fries. Also the wings were way over done so crunchy and hard. Everything was over cooked and not pleasing to eat. I'm debating to even return to this location again. Even though its close to my house."}
{"text":"The ten minute drive home was tortuous with the smell of wings filling the cabin. The roll and a few fries didn't survive the drive.

I love everything from Wingstop. From the season fries to the baked beans and don't forget the warm, soft roll.  Heaven.

The wings and fries are cooked to order. You can request regular or extra crispy for both.  I like soft fries so I order regular but I know a lot of ppl like crispy so make sure to tell them if you do. 

There are a few different fry seasonings you can choose from : Cajun, Lemon Pepper, Parmesan or Fry Seasoning. I always get the Fry Seasoning. It's what made me keep coming back. 

Today I ordered boneless original hot and I tried something new to me, the Louisiana Rub.

I'm thinking the Louisiana Rub might be better on bone in wings but it wasn't bad. It just tasted like battered chicken with some spices."}
{"text":"First time eating here, and I will not go back. The wait wasn't long, I'll give them that. But the food was yuck, I had pieces of chicken that wasn't done. My fries were limp. When they called my name I went to get my food, and they had to bag it because it was to go and some how they missed that. Went to bag my fries, and they were bagged with out putting them in a  take out container. I told them that was gross to have fries in a bag like that in the open. I was told that was company policy, still gross. So the manager again explained it was policy, I said ok. But she did put them in a carry out box. The best part of my meal was the ranch dressing that came with the chicken, and I had to pay almost a dollar for an extra one. Needless to say, but I will not be going back for half fried chicken and limp fries. Yuck and gross."}
{"text":"These were the hardest chicken wings I've had on Vegas.  My Mom asked me to make sure I didn't bring her here again.  I've been to other wing stop and I enjoyed the food.  I steamed the leftover and they were some what soft again.  Stay away from Rainbow and  Charleston."}
{"text":"The fries are really good.  I could eat them all day long!   The chicken strips themselves are really good, but I was just expecting more than some Parmesan cheese just sprinkled on top of them.  I thought by the picture that they have on their web site it was more of a sauce type of coating. Do not get me wrong they are still good but just not what I was expecting.   I can not wait to try some of the other flavors that they have though."}
{"text":"Wingstop is my favorite chain for wings. I originally got hooked in Tucson and I'm happy to report there's a Wingstop near Ak-Chin Pavillion (this location), which I plan to frequent more often.

The service was fast: wings and fries done in 14 minutes. Free drink refills for dine-in patrons (and they have Fanta!). 15 wings (up to two sauces), 2 drinks, an order of fries, and 2 ranch/bleu cheese dips for about $20 is not terrible. 

The wings were a little smaller than I remembered, but the sauce was just plain tasty (original hot).  I never really was \"into\" their fries before, but maybe because they were SO fresh and SO hot... I just devoured them with the bleu cheese. I wish I had some right now :P

The tables were all clean, with a few patrons in and out while we were there. 

Love Wingstop, love their menu items, prices are A-OK."}
{"text":"okay, where do I start....
My family loves wingstop chicken wings....... I HATE dealing with wingstop employees.
Yesterday we called to place an order, they put us on hold for over 10 minutes and never came back to the phone so we decided on something else for dinner.

Tonight..... thought I would by pass the phone and order on line.

Ordered at 6:30.... 30 wings for pick up, online ordering said it would be ready at 6:55
Got there at 6:55, called to have them bring out the food(curb-side pick up)..... again placed on hold... waited.... waited.. finally went in.... was told my order would be ready in 10-15 minutes.
I really hate to be a b*tch.... there was no one in line.....6-7 employees wandering around behind the counter...... 3 people in the corner of the restaurant that already had their food.
Why in the world was I even placed on hold.....6 employees and no one can answer a phone call? Why wasn't the food ready...... 45 minutes to cook 30 wings???????
These employees obviously have no desire to work. Hoping you don't call in an order.

It is really sad that a place that has such good food has such horrible service. I hope the owner of Wingstop in the Santa Fe reads this...... we would love to be regular customers! Your employees make us want to never come back!"}
{"text":"There's always consistency with the taste of my wings, and how nice the staff are.  I am obsessed with the mild wings.  No matter what, come see Cynthia!!! She's awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad this location opened up...... way easier for me than having to go into the Santa Fe Casino for wings........Ordered take out on a weekday, family pack of 40 wings and fries. I got the Louisiana Rub, the Lemon Pepper, and the Garlic Parmesan flavors on the wings. I also ordered all flats and cooked well done....... They were cooked perfectly!!!!
I recommend if getting take out, order well done on the wings and on the fries too, this helps them to stay crispy on the trip to their final destination......"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today Food was hot and fresh and we had an amazing cashier server named Whisper she was very attentive and got us refills and kept checking on us throughout our lunch. We definitely will be back and highly recommend the food but the service was the best. Great job Whisper!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered given a 15 minute wait. 
 Small place pricey. 8 wings and fries and a drink for 9 bucks times 2.
 More to come. Granddaughter ordered teriyaki I ordered garlic and mild. 
 These do not come with celery unless you use that as your side.
 Now we waited a half hour and they packed it in a bag. We told them dine in when we ordered. We will see how these are. 
 Ok got the boneless wings. 
 Greasy as heck 
 The chicken made me think McNuggets at a high price. 
 They really hardly had a taste to them. 
 The garlic was well, I'm still waiting for the flavor. 
 My granddaughter liked hers. 
 But I probably will not make this my stop for wings. The 
 Sad. And they just opened too."}
{"text":"Worst Wing Stop ever!!! Ordered 8 wings and took over 1 hour. Staff needs to be replaced immediately or this place will close soon!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here quite a few times, and it is pretty good. I LOVE the garlic Parmesan, it's absolutely delicious and the workers are always extremely nice and hard workers. Oh and the fries, I absolutely cannot get enough but I also would like to add that although the food is good it can be a little pricey here. Honestly at wingstop heaven, the garlic parmesan is better in my opinion because they use freshly minced garlic, but other than that the fries are better here hands down."}
{"text":"I LOVE Wing Stop! I have been eating it for years and it's only gotten better with meatier wings and more variety on their menu. I usually stick to half garlic parm and half bbq traditional wings. I get cheese for there fries and can DRINK the ranch....okay so imagine someone drinking ranch, kinda gross, no I actually don't drink it. But it IS the bomb! The sweet/salt seasoning for the fries is perfect and the yeast rolls are yummy!! The only con to Wing Stop is the price, it's a lil bit pricey for some wings. 
At this location they actually sell beer!! And they have the new coke machine that will dispense any coke product you want with whichever flavoring you want. I LOVE the cherry vanilla coke. Parking here is easy and krispy kreme makes you drool since it is next door....If you haven't beent to a Wing Stop before I DARE YOU TO HIT IT UP!!!!"}
{"text":"The lemon pepper wings were to greasy, and undercook. The wings were to salty, and the lemon pepper wings tasted blend! The home made  ranch dressing was terrible! The cheesy fries were okay, but I didn't  get any jalape√±os in my cheese sauce! BWW have better wings hands down! I have to admit, the Louisiana Cajun wings were okay."}
{"text":"Great wings, even better customer service. The tenders are good as well. I highly recommend the Louisiana Rub."}
{"text":"Sure, the staff are kind of disappointing, but the wings are tasty; I usually prefer them for take-out over BWW, especially their atomic wings. I can't speak to the non-chicken parts of the menu--I've only ordered sides once with low expectations, so I honestly don't remember if I was satisfied or not.

Overall, call ahead and get take-away for some of the cheapest, tastiest wings at home. No, it won't revolutionize your chicken wing world, but it's good enough to make a regular appearance at movie night."}
{"text":"Only reviewing the bar area.  I came here to meet a friend a catch a little March Madness.  Clean facility, wasn't that busy, and plenty of televisions to catch the sport event you want to watch. 

Staff is very friendly and helpful, but maybe a little bit too much?  They have a lot of employees working there than actual customers so you are being checked on a little too much.  They might be a little too quick to clear the table for you.  Just a minor correction that they could work on.  

Its not a full bar, in fact we asked what kind of liquor they had and he responded Margarita's and Beer.  Ok, duh, I think I could of looked at the bar to realize that. LOL. 
So yes, its truly just Margarita's and Beer, a few available on tap.  Oh, as an FYI, if you are kind to tip your bartender and you are paying by Credit Card, they don't have a gratuity line on the receipt.  So if you do get the Just right amount of good service, bring cash to tip them."}
{"text":"This is my go-to wing place since it's smack dab half way between work and home.  I frequent this place about once a week and always happy.  There have been a couple times when the wings have been pretty small and felt like they were the ugly step children of the batch.  I discovered the key was to be the first to get there.  Do that, and you get the biggest, juiciest, delicious wings you can image.

Services is great to!"}
{"text":"* Back on Yelp *

I come here often since I work in the casino my Favorite is the Garlic Parmesan it's so yummy I never try anything different since I already know this is the one I crave just thinking about wingstop  my boyfriend is always trying something different Majority of the time he likes it . Staff is always friendly and cooperative ! ."}
{"text":"Funny story..  

For years I thought this place was somehow related to Pizza Hut, but I guess there's is called something else.  I hear they get that all the time.  Finally, I decide to go inside because I'm hungry and I guess pizza hut wings would do.. 

Soooo glad I was wrong.

Wing Stop is a place that specializes in just wings.. win? I think so.  They have about 6-8 different flavors if I recall, but my personal favorite is the dusted Garlic Parmesan.  I can easily put 10 away. 

Now the way th ey do their wings is they dont do dozens, but instead they offer them in 10s and for an additional 2.95 ask if you want 5 more? clever huh?  I usually end up doing that.  

Oh don't forget to try their french fries.. holy crap..  they are fresh cut fries that are actually sweet!   de-frigging-licious.   My girlfriend always gets them with a side of hot cheese sauce.  I end up eating a few, walking away with a big smile.

I'm noticing the bad reviews here, but I personally have always been happy here.  

Why not 5 stars?  Because they're not the best wings Ive ever had.  That's a toss up between Native New Yorkers, Oregano's and Zipps wings.  These guys are up there though."}
{"text":"I visited this Wingstop for the first time ever and was not really impressed. I ordered a dozen boneless wings(all mild) and a drink. I explained to the ladies at the counter that I was a first timer and they weren't much help. I kind of had to figure out the menu by myself. She did explain the Monday special price but didn't really give me any info on the sauces, etc. Anyway.. the food was just OK, the breading was a little much but the wings were decent. I don't really have much else to say about the food. The mild sauce was a typical buffalo sauce and the ranch dressing was normal also. The restaurant wasn't super clean and there was only one other customer. The employees didn't look super put together but weren't rude. I don't think I would come back but I would give Wingstop another chance if anyone has any recommendations on other items or flavors to order."}
{"text":"Much better alternative than b-dubs
 Didn't have any problem with wait time on a Friday night. If you don't like your fries drowned in salt, I'd request for them to go light on it"}
{"text":"Ranch & Honey  mustard sauces are freaking delish, if  only they sold it in bottles. ..watch out when your food comes. It is so incredibly hot, scalding hot. Great friendly service. Best wings in the city..way better than Buffalo wild wings, by leaps & bounds. Thank god, they don't have delivery...it would be bad for me :) Only draw back is place is tiny, not alot of seating"}
{"text":"So every here and there, you just want a solid chicken wing without paying true restaurant pricing.  I have to say that the Lemon Pepper wings (bone in) at Wingstop are among the best chicken wings I've had whether in a restaurant or not.  Their dressings and dipping sauces are also all top notch.  Preferably the blue cheese or the ranch, they're both killer.  Many locations all over town so t makes it easy and convenient to find a location near you!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location! We've always gone to the one inside the Santa Fe Casino. 
Since we were ordering from a third party delivery we didn't get our food for about an hour which was fine. And even though the wingstop itself was actually further than others the food arrived very fresh, hot and still crispy. 
We ordered the boneless Family Pack for $23.99 which included 24 boneless wings, an order of fries and four dips. Super great price for that much food.
This was our first time trying the Voodoo fries and they were awesome! I'd order from this location again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years and I've never had a problem. Everything is always fresh and the employees are always nice. My only complaint is when you walk up when they are busy it's really smokey. But that is to be expected because they are in a food court and it is a small area. 

 Just recently I ordered for delivery using their 25 boneless wings for $15.00 special, and I wasn't disappointed. Everything came hot, fresh and still very crispy! They for sure have a returning customer!"}
{"text":"wings are always great.  I suggest the lemon pepper.  but it doesn't matter everytime I order online my food is never ready at the promised time.  other than that the wings are so good!"}
{"text":"The wings are really tasty and so are the fries. My favorite so far is the lemon pepper & garlic parmesan. I haven't tried the cajun or hawaiian or teriyaki yet, but I should have an updated this week. This has been our usual friday lunch spot for the past two fridays in a row. I like the 10 wing combo w/fries and a drink for under $10.00."}
{"text":"Horrible service, dining room is dirty and the soda machine is almost empty. Out of hundreds of options I think 3 are available. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Ok so my visit started a little different than normal. I came by myself to eat being pregnant living close and constantly craving hot wings. My order came out Luke warm because I believe the a/c is too cold for 8:40pm. But they tasted fabulous anyhow although I love my food really hot. I ate half the order and again being pregnant I needed to use the restroom. To my dismay no more than a minute later one of the staff was cleaning off tables and was about to throw away my food. I almost cried. He was so nice though and was so apologetic I felt bad to have to complain but after he had touched my food and had been cleaning tables I just felt disgusted to eat the rest of my meal after it had been tampered with. I spoke to Dominique and she made my experience go from a one star to a four star almost five. She was so sweet and kept me from crying lol preggo hormones. She fixed the problem with grace and kindness and I left with a smile on my face and will be coming back soon. Thank you so much! It human kindness like this that makes the world a much better place to live in.  Again thanks Dominique and the staff who was really friendly and accommodating. See u soon!"}
{"text":"Omg I couldnt believe they had opdn a wingstop so close to my house! I love this place... Its interior is extra spacious for big crowds! However the times I've been, its not super packed, just the right amount of people.
The employees are very friendly & courteous! The wings are finger licking oh so good!!! 
You must stop by!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out, when I got there to pick up my order there were 4 workers. All of them talking like if they were on break. Finally one recognized me to help me. When u got home j realized I was missing things from my order. Went back a f they would not redo my order. They were expecting me to eat a cold meal. Spoke to the supervisor and he was not authorized to do anything. Only give me what u was missing. I ended up asking for my money back. Wrote an email and haven't received any response. Their customer service is big there. I would not go there again!"}
{"text":"Food is always good, never a complaint. I don't appreciate Angelique's attitude towards me, her coworkers, and other customers in the establishment. My food was 20 minutes over the estimated wait time, and no one even offered a discount or assured me my food was being cooked. And I was given incorrect order the first time."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't ever go here. The manager is rude.  I ordered 10 garlic parmesan wings on a Friday evening at 9:45 pm.  When I got home they had given me the wrong order. I called them and they wanted me to bring them all the way back. Since I don't live right around the corner and I was starving I ate wings I didn't even order or want. Especially the hot wings. So I brought the hot wings back and the manager said she would only replace the wings I brought back. This was the next day.  That to me was horrible customer service.  My receipt specifically said garlic parm wings.  I told her to jus keep them and I will never go back into that store again or any wings top for that matter.  Two of the times a I went there before my order took 30 and 40 minutes after I called it in.  They still could not have them there on time.  Do yourself a favor and go anywhere EXCEPT WINGSTOP."}
{"text":"I love coming to this Wingstop. It's very spacious with lots of tables to sit at. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. The wings are on point!! You can also order ahead and take it to go.
I would highly suggest coming in to enjoy some wings. Family friendly!! You can also order to go using Door Dash. :)"}
{"text":"I really like the Cajun dry rub.  The veggies on the side were nice too - thick carrots to munch on."}
{"text":"Hands down the best staff I have ever encountered at any wing stop I've been to. Extremely nice, super helpful. I just had an overall wonder experience and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Walked in and all three employees were in the back sitting on the food prep counters... Fries were not bad, but a little undercooked and the Louisiana rub had so much seasoning/salt I could blow it off every wing and it was just over powering! The teriyaki and BBQ sauces were both good but all the wings were over cooked. I will not go back here..... I'd rather pay a little more for Buffalo Wild Wings!"}
{"text":"Ordered the garlic parmesan wings had to throw them out when I got home way too salty I think they spilled the whole jar of salt in my wings and fries very disappointed will not go back employees did not speak English what kind of place is this learn the language people I'm going to tell everybody at Nellis Air Force Base not to go there I'm in the Army very disappointed waste of $20"}
{"text":"Good wings for fast food, but when you have a craving this place definitely hits the spot."}
{"text":"Me and my friend felt like getting some wings tonight so we decided to come here. They close at midnight and we got there at 11:38 pm. As we walked up, a worker that was outside smoking a cigarette said they were closed as they were standing next to the \"open till midnight\" sign"}
{"text":"Garlic Parmesan hands down!

Ever since one of my die-hard-LA-Lakers-fan of an Aunt shared the \"Official Wings of the Los Angeles Lakers\" (funny enough) to my family one day - that was a set of 10 lemon pepper flavored wings - my adventurous side smirked at the idea of experimenting with a few other flavors. Thankfully, this branch is located barely 10 minutes away from where I live so when the opportunity to pick a new flavor presented itself, I went with  'Garlic Parmesan' and 'Hickory Smoked BBQ' Both of which were undeniably tasty. 

My father and I have grown to become huge fans of this place and always opt for the 20 piece wings (that comes with 2 flavor choices) He continues to stick with lemon pepper while I've branched out to Garlic Parmesan...by. a. mile. Not only does the texture make the wing so savory but the garlic really does compliment the parmesan in a way that makes the overall taste so rich, the world converges towards it. 

For $13.19 (+ tax), you can choose to get 15 or 20 pieces (I'd be insane to let an extra 5 pieces pass!) and for an additional $2, you can go for wings only (no mini legs) not that it really matters. There's a drive-thru in case you're in a hurry and the staff is very friendly, not to mention humorous (we joked about how they couldn't pronounce my name) There're seats in the restaurant - not the more spacious, I have to be honest - but other than that, this place gives you all the reason for a stop - great food and great service! 

What a win!"}
{"text":"Great employees working for wingstop first time that I seen wingstop greet there customers made me feel good the place is really clean and like I said great staff audrey took my order there she is very friendly I will go there more often even when they move thank you wingstop great place to eat"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first experience here. I've been hearing about this place for a long time and I'm glad I finally went. The regular 10 wing combo basket seemed a little pricey but after killing my cajun wings and the basket of amazing fries, I was stuffed! The food was great quality and the neat new Coca-Cola machine was an interesting conversation piece. I really enjoyed the cashier that helped us, she was very experienced with the product and very helpful. I will definitely recommend this restaurant and I will for sure be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Just called in for an order at 11:25 some young punk ass lazy kid has had me on hold because he doesn't want to take my order because the close at 12:00. Fuck this place. And the sorry ass management that hired these kids"}
{"text":"I would at hands down- best wings in Vegas!  If you call in a \"to go\" or stop and eat inside...it's a great place. Plan for 20-25 min for cooking time. Some advice...
-bone in is the best 
- BBQ and Lemon pepper are my favs
- Cajun is my fianc√©s fave 
-Family packs are the best 
-try every flavor
-great for game days
-everything is made to order"}
{"text":"Restaurant is disgusting. Service is terrible. Took 45 minutes for them to tell us our wings were ready but we were still waiting on fries. Restaurant was empty. Food was refunded. Never going back. 

The staff is so rude. No one is trained in customer service."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I'm a huge fan of Wing Stop and was excited when I came across the restaurant. Okay so when I entered the restaurant they're were 4 people who had already ordered and been seated. It took 35 minutes for my food to come out, all of which was FREEZING COLD! But wait, it gets better. Both drink machines had ABSOLUTELY no drinks available, and one was so out of order that it was shooting unmixed liquid all over whomever tried to use it (me included). The drink machine not only ruined my experience but also my shirt and when I reached for napkins, yep you guessed it, THERE WERE NONE! I politely asked the waitress for some napkins so I could clean the mess and she gave me the worst attitude, as if that wasn't part of her job description. I mean I'm sure some of these things were out of their control but at the very minimum I would have liked an apology for my shirt being ruined! To say the least, I won't be back and I will definitely contact corporate.. I do not recommend this Wing Stop."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place, though the last time the wings were anemic, but the boneless ones were pretty good.  Love the Coke super soda machine.  The only real issue I have are the fries.  They put something on them that makes them sweet and they just don't taste rift."}
{"text":"I honestly love this location of Wingstop. Not only do they get my orders correct every time, they prepare it timely as well! I have tried many locations and I find the staff at this location very friendly. They are extremely clean as well. I will definitely be coming back to this location more often. Especially being obsessed with hot wings, I can not wait to try out their other flavors."}
{"text":"This is my go to location for wingstop as it is the closest to my home. I'm excited that they had expanded their location. No more standing ovation or sitting in my car while waiting for my wings. I haven't actually dined in here as I always take my order for to-go.

Staff are okay. They're somewhere in between friendly and unfriendly if there's such a thing....lol Sometimes I feel welcome, and there are times that they are just cold. Everytime I attempt to make an order over the phone, I'm always put on hold for like forever so most of the time I end up just ordering it in person.

I have no complaints on the wings as they are always good, yummy and saucy!!! :) Bone in lemon pepper and cajun are my faves!"}
{"text":"I hate when workers give you bad attitude when you approach them so nicely. The lady taking our order was so rude from the tone of her voice to the look on her face. If you don't like working here then leave. This is how you chase away your customers. So stuck up! I didn't have a attitude until I realized she did. Didn't even know her name bc she didn't have a name tag on. A girl with a full face of MU is as much I can describe her as ?"}
{"text":"I honestly loveeee wingstop and prefer it over bdubs or hooters, but there's just something about this fricken location that makes me mad lol. I've been to this location a good amount of times since it's just down the street from UNLV. Every time I've ever been here, they have never greeted me - no hi, welcome, or anything. Maybe it's just me? lol I just think that should be a standard and it's common courtesy. 

I usually order the 6 pc combo (bone in - lemon pepper & garlic Parmesan) & it comes with fries & a drink. I try to get it extra crispy but here's my problem... just a normal order takes FOREVER. The combo I get (without getting it extra crispy) takes AT LEAST 30 mins. Always. It doesn't matter if I'm with a group of people or I'm by myself & nobody's in the store. It always takes at least 30 min. If I get it extra crispy... it's like a fricken hour. Why does it take so long?! 

You can see the workers from where you sit & every time I look back there, they're just standing around & just one person is actually doing work. It sucks cos I love their food, it just takes forever & the service sucks."}
{"text":"I went in for the first time, ordered boneless wings, 20 pack. What a disappointment. I will never eat there again, they were chicken tender chunks, obviously processed and tasted the same. Great customer service at the counter, but that is all."}
{"text":"Wings here are pretty good. But I didnt like the fact that I had to wait more than 20 mins for my order. Besides the girl at the front counter seemed to be a little angry to every customer that walked in that night."}
{"text":"They deserve 5 stars for their wings.

They screw up sometimes but they've always made things right."}
{"text":"Ghhhaa..loved this place the first time we went. Was impressed with the wings & bar service while we waited. 
It was busier this time but not crazy busy; bar service wasn't bad but wasn't great..HOWEVER I only go here & eat wings because they offer boneless so yea I'm now pissed because we ordered 24 wings, got home & NONE OF THEM ARE BONELESS ;( 
Lammme
I'd call but don't feel like dealing with it. 
Hoping I get to update this review to make it better..whenever we decide to go back."}
{"text":"Staff were rude and nasty!!! They got my order wrong and instead of them offering to fix it they asked nastily if I wanted a refund! After I offered to wait until they remake it the staff went into the backroom and talked among themselves until a new customer came in. I would not recommend this wingstop location."}
{"text":"I was told it would take 12 minutes. A half an hour later I received my food, chicken is tasty but the fries were so damn soggy. Probably go to buffalo wild wings next time."}
{"text":"it was very convenient for lunchtime. Customer service was okay they weren't very excellent to explain some sauce to us first timers. Parking was available."}
{"text":"Thank God for Wingstop!  The place that made me stop ordering Wingstreet at Pizza Hut!

In late 2011 I decided to give this place a try and it became one of my absolute favorites because it had one thing that no other place had...

The Coca-Cola Freestyle Machine!  Wide varieties of different soft drinks all with a touch screen menu!  The best thing ever for me...Diet Vanilla Coke!!!!

Always go boneless, that's how I roll.

I LOVE their smoky bbq flavor along with their Hawaiian sauce, sometimes if I'm feeling a bit adventurous, I'll get the Louisiana Rub for a bit of a kick.  To this day though, I've yet to try their Original Hot.

The fries...man, I don't know what it is in that seasoning, but sometimes I think there's a hint of brown sugar mixed in!!!  There's definitely a bit of sweetness to them fries!

The dipping sauce...oh my God!!!! Their honey mustard is like a drug, I can't get enough of it, and their ranch....oh man, the creaminess of that stuff when you dip your fries/wings in it...-Christopher Walken voice- Wow...wowie-wow-wow!

Plus, they've got quite possibly THE best baked beans I've ever eaten.  Who cares about gas, INDULGE YOURSELF!!!! NOW! DO IT NOW! GET THE BEANS!!!!!!!!

I think I know where I'm getting dinner tonight!

Here's to you Wingstop!  Thanks for making me a repeat customer for nearly 5 years now!"}
{"text":"I don't care what anybody says I'm not even a chicken wing fan and I didn't go into this place but my nanny went over and bought a whole bunch of different kinds of wings I had some boneless Parmesan garlic and they were absolutely out of this world
I don't know if I was just super duper hungry
Or if they were just dynamic but either way
They were good 

I didn't go inside
It was delivers to me at my house by a friend"}
{"text":"The hubby and I were craving wings to eat during the hockey game. We had passed by this place a couple of times and decided to try it. Can I just say 1st and foremost how nice the manager and the employees were??  GREAT customer service!!  The manager explained some different options to  us and we dove right in. We ordered Mild wings (sorry but I'm a wuss) and BBQ wings. Our sides were fries and potato salad. Both types of wings were good. There was a lot of sauce on the BBQ wings  both sauces were finger licking good. The fries were good. They were hot and salty and I believe there was a pinch of sweetness to them. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the potato salad. It needed salt or a little more flavoring. 
We will definitely be back. We want to try the baked beans and coleslaw and a few other wing flavors. The wings are a little small so order more than you normally would."}
{"text":"I normally don't like eating fried foods because of the greasiness, but I guess it's ok once in a while. I would rather make a call next time.

The service was ok I mean they gave me enough time to see what I wanted and when I was ready I still was waiting for a couple minutes. Nothing too bad to complain about but that's what happened.

I ordered the 3 chicken strip meal, parmesan and garlic, usually i'd go for hot and mild sometimes.

The atmosphere was cool and filled with airplane parts and had a couple of tv's which wasn't too shabby.

The flavor was alright although you can taste the parmesan and garlic, it wasn't too strong, the texture was semi crunchy if not dry although there were small bits that were a little soggy, The fries just seemed kinda greasy and soft but did have that salt and sweet taste, The ranch was really rich and creamy though. They did have a multi drinks mixer but I just had water...maybe next time i'll try the lemonade.

Between wingstop and wings n things I would have to go with wings n things. But Wingstop is definitely a contender."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good reviews so I went and tried it out. The place was clean and good service. I wasn't a fan of the wings they are more on the slimy side. The French fries had good seasoning."}
{"text":"Today we visited Wing Stop on Mayfield. The online ordering process was easy. However our order was not correct!! They attempted to fixed and still got it wrong. While the cashier was polite about it. She seemed as though we were bothering her. It's Sunday and no football games are on their TVs. Smhh"}
{"text":"We order from this wing stop frequently, but tonight we had a bad experience. I ordered for pick up at 7:10pm, was told the order would take 18 minutes. Did not walk in until 7:30, and then were told it would \"be done shortly.\" We then proceeded to wait 15 minutes, before my boyfriend went up to the counter to see how much longer it would be...the employees were so busy chatting amongst themselves that they didn't care to check that our order had been ready to go, next to multiple to go bags. We saw many people getting their food before ours that came in way after us. We've also seen a time where a man was trying to swipe his wife's card without her present, and when the employee declined, he said something to her in Spanish and then the employee proceeded to swipe the card. What if that was a stolen card? 

The food here is always great, but the service is definitely questionable..."}
{"text":"I normally do not leave bad/critical reviews, but this location was an embarrassment. Trash covering the tables, workers smoking directly in front of the main door, and to top it off- the RUDEST staff I've ever encountered in this area. Perhaps they were all brand new. Perhaps at some point, moments before I walked in, they were so slammed they couldn't think about picking up the trash on/around the tables. Perhaps the workers were trying new methods of \"customer engagement\" by accusing me of lying and arguing with me in front of 10 people in line. Perhaps they were just off that night.

Whatever the case- avoid this location. It's worth the drive to BWW's."}
{"text":"The wings were pretty good, although I would probably ask for the sauce on the side next time as they were super saucy and messy. The only thing was the wait time was a little ridiculous. For what you get, it's a little over-priced IMO. I would rather go pick up some wings from the grocery store or even BWW."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for customer service. Very welcoming and inviting the staff greets every customer that comes in the door.  They ask for your name as soon as you reach the counter. I will be back just because of the great service. He even let me know about the  brownies and the coupons they started to mail  out."}
{"text":"I will NEVER order from here because, when I call and you tell me you don't know the number to your other location, your an idiot, you know you just can't be bothered so I will tell everyone \"YOUR RUDE\" lost business for your location!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Grease and fat...you cant go wrong...takes a while to get food, but its all made to order. Decent food, a bit spendy, very greasy but everyone needs to splurge once in a while."}
{"text":"They forgot my ranch but the manager took care of it and I really appreciated it. I went back to order more and the services are great!"}
{"text":"Ordered their boneless wing special today. The lemon pepper and the garlic parmesan were good but their fries are horrible. I thought with asking for them to be cooked well done, they'd be good."}
{"text":"Wont be eatting here again. They use to have 5 wings for $3.. So i ordered 10 wings, and it comes out to $11.50ish.. That math isnt right. So the employee says its right because its actually $3.25 for five (still not right) and insists its the tax.. Finally one of the cooks corrects here and says its $4.90 or something like that. Which made more sense because i got ranch too... I came here because i just wanted some quick wings at a good price. If i was gonna be spending $11 i wouldve went to bww for some better wings. I dont like that the employees running the registers arent educated in the prices. $10 an hour shld drop to $7 an hour in that case."}
{"text":"I have to have a taste for wings to eat them. They're not my favorite food to eat, but I do generally enjoy them when I have them. My favorite place to get wings, based on quality, is Wingstop.

I've been to Wingstop 3 times and this location all 3 times. There's a bunch of things I truly appreciate about this place compared to other places. There's also a few I don't enjoy so much. 

First of all, from here on out when I go, I will know exactly how to order, to get the biggest bang for my buck. At first, I was confused on the prices compared to the quantity. I don't quite know what I ordered my first time ordering but it was much more expensive than my last two times. I realized on my 2nd visit that I can get the 12 piece combo that includes a large fry and 2 drinks, all for 17.99. I usually add 3 extra wings for 2.99. That gives me just enough to split the food with my partner and pay less than 23.00 while doing so. Perfect!

I like the favors that they offer. Anywhere I go, I generally order some variation of Garlic. Here I get Garlic Parmesan. I enjoyed them, although they do put a lot of Parmesan on the wings. More than I've gotten anywhere else. It can be overwhelming, but I'm not big on complaining. Also, I've tried the Lemon Pepper (L.P) flavor, mild and Spicy Korean or something like that. They're all really good, but I would like more salt in the L.P flavor.

Since the 1st time I went, the wait has gotten shorter and shorter. The very first time I went, I waited about 25 minutes to get my food. The 2nd time was about 20 minutes and they 3rd time, the quickest wait, was only like 10 minutes. It does depend on the time you go and how pack the place is, of course. 

The first 2 times, the place was packed. The 3rd time, I thought I would be smart and call before I left my house (12 minute drive) so the food would be ready been we got there. I felt really smart when the girl picked up and put me on a 5minute hold, I just knew they were packed. When she finally came back and attempted to take my order, she just couldn't get it right. Her attention wasn't there. She was repeating things I didn't order. I ended up getting irritated and telling her that I will just come in and order. I felt like I was just wasting time and we were starving.

When I made it in to the store, I could tell by her voice, I was working with the same girl. She was just as inattentive in person. She was looking around and paying attention and talking to other cashiers as they took orders. I guess she was making sure that they were taking orders correctly or she could've needed help. Either way, I had to repeat my order a couple times.

When we got the food, it was just as fresh as the previous times. The Cajun seasoning (.10 extra) fries were perfect. They were seasoned to perfection. Really everything tasted incredible.

I also like the fact that the plates, condiments, napkins and everything else is self serve. I hate asking for plates and napkins.

I would definitely recommend this place, especially on Mondays and Tuesdays because the boneless wings are .70..."}
{"text":"Perhaps it isn't entirely fair for me to give a rating of 1 star since I never tried the wings. After sitting at the bar for over 10 minutes we left. A nod, a smile, a glass of water even would have been wonderful but 3 different people walked by us multiple times without even a basic acknowledgement. They were half empty too."}
{"text":"Great wings always service is good but they need to double check orders they've messed up 2 of my orders so far"}
{"text":"Love there wings here they are always fresh.
The fries are a little stale somtimes and not seasoned well"}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever!! The guy who took our order was too distracted watching the football game that was on tv or playing on his phone. I took us about 10 mins to order a 20 piece meal because he was so preoccupied. Zero customer service skills!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the customer service is bad. The location is 85 degrees inside. It was so hot that we asked for them to turn the fans on."}
{"text":"Love Wingstop from Houston to Omaha now in AZ and they are here too!!!!! My favorite are the Garlic Parm mmm. Stopped in today for lunch greeted by Nicole very pleasant and helpfully lady and the wings were awesome. .."}
{"text":"I love Wingstop I have been to there locations first in Houston,then back home in Nebraska and now here in Phoenix.  They are my go to chain place I even prefer them over BWW.  My fav is the garlic Parm with seasoned fries and Bleu cheese dressing.  Today I had the pleasure of being helped by Amber ...great customer service ...I shall be back"}
{"text":"Carolyn had the best personality very cheerful I'm from Long Beach California you cant get customer service like that in Cali thank you for making me feel welcome 6 star if I could"}
{"text":"I go to this wing stop every week and this is the first time I've had exceptional service from a wing stop employee. Isaiah's personality would make customers continue to come to this store. Thank you for making sure orders are correct and putting a smile on your customers face!"}
{"text":"Wings were cooked right& good size. Staff was great, it took a while that was because they cooked fresh to order- defiantly worth a visit"}
{"text":"First and last time. First the wing portions were the size of pigeon wings with broken pieces. They came out floating in grease. Seriously the nastiest wings I've ever eaten. Very sad for a new establishment. Wait time was incredibly long. To the owners...are you guys asleep?"}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place! I'm not proud to say that but these are the best wings in town. The other locations aren't even this good. I usually come here at least once a week. The staff is extra friendly and they always make me feel welcome. The restaurant is always clean and every since they expanded there is more seating. They have a customer as well long as I live in Vegas. Keep up the good work. Love this place."}
{"text":"Ok so I really like wings. When I tried this place I noticed...the wings were a decent size. If you've never seen my magic talent of putting a wing in my mouth and removing all the meat and skin in one swift motion, you don't know what your missing.....But this wing place is definitely better foodwise than Bdubs. I like the different flavors and dry rubs like the garlic parm ---(kinda salty but it's good) The atomic is grreeeat! It gives me the food sweats. It doesn't have a big selection as bdubs --- but it's definitely good. For me --- the key to eating good wings. Is to get them plain --- while they're crispy and dip them in the sauce. So that way you can taste chicken and not just doused chicken in sauce."}
{"text":"Heard about Wing Stop from my sister due to the special on Monday and Tuesday.

If you are looking for take-out, be sure to call in 15-20 minutes in advance or you may have to wait.
Though the advertisement said it was 50 cent boneless, the store has upped the price to 60 cents per wing for some time which is still cheaper than normal price. 

Tried the bone-in classic and I personally found them better than the boneless wings at Wing Stop due to the salty-ness. When the wings were boneless, the seasoning was a little too salty for me compared to the bone-in classic.

Tried the atomic, and it isn't as spicy as I thought. Both the atomic (spiciest at Wing Stop) and Cajun (their main flavor) were both spicy to the tongue, however, tolerable if you are into spicy foods. Do not try if you are not into spicy food. However, if you are, these are definitely ones to try. Both to me seemed to taste fairly similar except for that Atomic had cracked pepper in the spicy rub. 

If you are not into spicy, tried some of the classic bone-in wing with Lemon Pepper, and those were addicting. It is something to try, recommend it.

Wing size compared to other places I've been to, are bigger, which is good if you like it with a little more meat. 

Overall, good place, near where I live, and though they do get busy on special days, so be sure to call in beforehand!"}
{"text":"yummaaaaaaay....open till midnight! Chill outside on the patio at night, or during the day if its not 110 degrees. Fresh veggies, tasty blue cheese dip. Weird baked beans, more like baked bean soup. They tell everyone 18 minutes for the order to be ready. You may want to call ahead if your impatient."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and messed up my order when I received it. The lady who delivered it said that's just what they gave her and they don't actually give her a list of what is included in the order. 

Tried calling for 30 minutes and phone is perpetually busy and can't get a live person. 

Edit: finally spoke to a rep who refused to send out the missing items and said he would add it as credit for the next order. He blamed me for using the third party delivery service when I ordered directly through the app. 

Amazing customer service here! /sarcasm"}
{"text":"Love their low carb options here.  Their Louisiana Rub is probably one of the best tasting wing rubs I've ever had and their ranch is to die for.  I am especially happy with them having those awesome drink machines that let me get a Peach Sprite Zero!  Yeah baby!  Good stuff."}
{"text":"I have come here multiple times and I was once again able to get some good customer service and some good food.

First off, I always appreciate a business that will make sure to get you the best value available. I had ordered some blue cheese sauce on the side, and the woman who took my order recommended a single bigger and cheaper size instead of the more expensive individual containers I initially wanted.

I ordered some garlic parmesan and original hot wings. When I came in and picked up my order everything was finishing being bagged up, so I didn't have to wait long in getting my food and heading out.

When I got home, the wings were hot and crispy with the perfect amount of seasoning and sauce covering everything. 

This is my go to store for wings. There is a crappy Wings restaurant that Is minutes from my house. But I will always take the extra time to drive to this store amd get consistently good food and service."}
{"text":"We found this place Sunday after church and have been going ever since. Everything is fresh made and delicious. Very friendly staff. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch got the lunch special no biggie upgraded fries .  Got my food to go no sauce no dip. Girl told me we offer no dips for specials. What the heck. Should have told me that while I was ordering I could have opted to buy.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"We  wing stop!  The staff is always super friendly and helpful.  When we can't decide on what to eat, we always end up here.  I don't like spicy so I always get the garlic parm & lemon pepper.  Also, their ranch is amazing and I'm a huge fan of their fries and veggie sticks!  I  that the fries are a little sweet .  The wait is lengthy which is fine with me but if you're in a hurry, just call ahead."}
{"text":"First time here. The wait staff is helpful and friendly.  The store is really clean and not overcrowded with drunken sports fan. A plus for this neighborhood.  I'm looking forward for my next order."}
{"text":"Their atomic and garlic parmesan wings are awesome!!! Fresh baked rolls and fries are also very good !!!"}
{"text":"I came here and orders the 8 wings combo. I got half bbq and half Cajun. The wings were decent. They were a bit overcooked for me. I usually love wing stop fries but somehow here, the seasoning was less flavorful. I would still swing by if I was craving wings and needed a quick wing fix."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this location. I actually called in my order ahead of time so I didn't have to wait very long. The lady who answered the phone was super friendly and helpful. I arrived early so I had to wait a little while but I didn't mind the wait because I knew my food would be fresh. I ordered lemon pepper with fries. The fries were fresh and very well seasoned. The wings were fresh and hot so i had to wait before I could eat them. The only thing I absolutely did not like was there was a think layer of grease in the bottom of the container. That kinda grossed me out because it means they didn't properly drain the food before placing in the to-go container. Now mind you, the wings are probably not the best thing to be eating but they should have at least let grease soak off before giving to the customer. I had to wrap the wings in paper towels to get all the grease off. 

I would go back again but I would make sure to give specific instructions to ensure grease was drained properly and order more fries. :-)"}
{"text":"Cooked to order wings (8-10 flavors). Soft drinks & cold beer. I had bone-in wings 3 flavors), fries (skin on--yum!) & up-sized soda. Very reasonable price. Only negative: Having to pay $1 each for my dips: Ranch & Bleu cheese ( is there any other ?!) Friendly staff. Very clean. Return visit worthy. Take a night off and do take-out and movie nite at home."}
{"text":"I was between the 'experienced better' and 'a-okay' for this review. What helped push it into the 3-star territory was the fact that I enjoyed the service here having eating in. 

My sister and I came in late night for some sibling bonding, also, we forgot where Steak-and-Shake was. We ordered the 2-person Combo of 15 boneless wings that came with a serving of any kind of their fries and two soft drinks. Not a bad price I must say as it came out to about $20 for all of that. 

The fries were okay, not my favorite. They weren't very flavorful to me or salty enough. As for the boneless wings, I enjoyed the juiciness of the parmesan garlic wings, but the parmesan wasn't really pronounced nor was the garlic. Meanwhile, the Hawaiian wings came out a little dry and chewy and almost a little too ginger-y. 

But despite that, my sister and I still had a good time and joked with the staff there whenever they passed by, so I definitely appreciate that. 

Overall, it's a fine late-night pit stop. Have some fun with it."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years now, mostly ordering to pick up, but occasionally eating in. Every time I call to pick up, the order is ready within ten minutes and it's FRESH. I've never had to wait longer than ten, and today is no different, though I'm dining at a table before my eye appointment. I always always always order Lemon Pepper boneless wings- I love variety as much as the next guy if not more, but I CANNOT branch away because these are so damn tasty. Dip them in honey mustard.
The dining room is clean but divey enough for my tastes, and is certainly a welcome respite from the... um, pleasure of Spectrum Christown Mall. That's uncalled for, I'm sorry. 
Anyway, ridiculously tasty, fresh, inexpensive chicken and beer. I got no complaints."}
{"text":"Great wings great service and the owner is always there. I always order online I have never had a bad experience.  The owner will adjust order if their was a mistake. Favorite wing. Place."}
{"text":"This store so far has the best service in all of laveen. Carla is amazing! No matter who is helping you they always give there name and are always so helpful! Thank you for giving great food and service to laveen. We need more business like this."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place.  I see them sporatically all over the valley, and assumed they were a half decent place to get wings and a beer.  I still think that, but my stomach does not.  I was dissapointed with my experience here, and for now, am scratching any plans on returning.

I wanted to try something different for dinner last night, something new.  I didnt want fancy, or to blow a lot of money, just something out of the norm.  I swung by wingstop after feeling like I needed some chicken wings, and not from Wendys.  lol.  So, I ended up here.

I walked in and the place isnt huge, but seats quite a few.  Studied the menu, asked a few questions, and ended up ordering the 3 peice chicken wing combo for a reasonable price.  I went with the BBQ flavor.

So, the food comes out like 10 minutes later.  I couldnt even finish it.  The fries were so salty and tasted weird..they were spicy I think?  My toungue didnt know what to do!  The wings were doused in BBQ sauce!  I mean buried!   It was like they went to Wendys or McDonalds, got some BBQ sauce, and poured it over the top of the wings, and wala,BBQ chicken wings.  It was just to much for me to finish.  It was to much with the sauce.  Even after I scraped some off, I still couldnt down the rest.  

My stomach gurgled the rest of the night.  It didnt like what I fed it.  I woke up in the middle of the night wanting to hurl, but ended up not doing so, thank goodness.  It was to much for my tummy to handle.  :-(

I don't think I will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of wings, but this place was pretty good. I would normally order the boneless wings in a Garlic Parmesan flavor with a side of fries. The wings were flavored well and had a good amount of meat. Fries were good, but to me, they could have been cooked longer so they would be crispy. Almost every time I got fries here, they seemed soggy, not greasy, just didn't stand straight. I like fries that I can actually pick up with my fingers and dip them in my ketchup.

Food usually takes awhile to come out, even if there are only one or two people ahead of you waiting on their food. 

It's a give or take as to whether you'll find a clean table. Many times I'd come in here and there were still dirty baskets on the table or they hadn't been cleaned off. Nothing more frustrating than having to remind the staff what they need to do. And what makes it even worse is that those times, there weren't many people there. Lots of empty tables, just dirty. 

This location offers a bar, so you can order your beer or other alcoholic beverage, eat your wings and watch sports on one of many TVs. You do have to be 21 years old to sit at the bar. However, I saw several times when people sat there and they didn't check ID's. Maybe they were regulars. 
 
Overall, I like the food here..just maybe order my food to go."}
{"text":"I'm a BIG wing fan... so ya gotta get it right, or I'm outta there! WingStop on Maryland is VERY GOOD FOOD, great service and very fast (17 min) ! The wings are med/large size & cooked very well, just the right amount of chewiness texture (I can't even cook'em the way they do :-). Multiple flavors; I like the buffalo style, the lemon pepper & bbq all outstanding. {Tho I hold my opinion :( of the teriaki}. Price is ok at 20 wings, up to 3 flavors @$19.
      Mon. & Tues. special @ .60 cents each. 
      They charge you for the sauces... soooo bring your own! lol 
I like they're atmosphere, but I always phone order to go."}
{"text":"Sauces we had on our wings were good the only compliant I have is the wings them self are small compared to the rest of the wing you find in Madison."}
{"text":"yumm.. i've been thinking about their wings all night. and im gonna go get some after i finish this review! i like the wings here better than buffalo wild wings. cuz all they do is wings. i dont have to sit around wondering what im gonna order. they have a good variety of flavors but not so many that you cant decide. their combos are perfect. 10 wings fries and a drink. and you can pick two flavors.. plus its pretty close to my house. ha!"}
{"text":"So...this particular wing stop is super clean, amazing staff, and great service. BUT, their food is sub-par on a good day. I have tried multiple different wings thinking maybe it was \"just that one time\" realizing that well unfortunately for me, the customer, there are consistent pitfalls in their final product. 

I tried some atomic wings even thinking maybe that would do the trick. I was heavily disappointed with not only the flavorless deceit of their sauce but also that their frail tasting wings lacked any measurement on the Scoville scale. Weak sauce Wing Stop is my new name I'm coining. What happened? Maybe it's just this specific location, but even the mango-habanero was a disappointment at best.

Save yourself the letdown and skip this place.

 2 stars"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is a new location, being that we're new to Nevada buh my husband and I love Wingstop! Although our experience here wasn't the best.. our chicken wings were over cooked and barely had any seasoning/flavor.. We both ordered lemon pepper and Cajun wings, extra crispy fries with extra seasoning.. we like to do our orders online and pick them up, once we retrieved our order and brought it home we realized that our order was completely wrong. Fries were soggy  with no seasoning, annoying! when we called to let the manager know what happened she immediately explains to us when you order dry rubs they wings aren't wet.. (come on now we know that) that doesn't mean that the shouldn't have any seasoning right? Any way I went back up to the store the manager lets me know she told the cook to make the fries crispy and the wings wet and they redid our order once I bring the food back home to my husband we open our boxes and they were full grease I guess that's they way they make them look wet?? I'm confused.. anyway I will not return to this location.."}
{"text":"This store has been remodeled to double the seating capacity. Thank you and we'll done.
Besides beers in the bottle they also have the Coke Freestyle machines with 100's of soft drink choices available. Which is great for all ages.
My favorite is the boneless wings, with carrots and celery, with blue cheese to dip the veggies.
Sauce flavor favorites: Hickory smoked BBQ, Cajun, and traditional Hot wing sauce top my list.
I have eaten here several times, and never had a bad experience. I will be coming back.
Atmosphere is casual and they always play sports on the TV, and they have TV's on every wall.
This place gets busy, so plan ahead if you are going during a big game or during a dinner rush.
I would recommend this place to others.
Obviously, the menu is just chicken - which is great for me. They stick to doing 1 thing well."}
{"text":"I've never experienced such a RUDE manager. 

She was talking poorly about customers right in front of everyone. I honestly couldn't believe it. 

We had gotten something incorrect on our order and she says \"not our fault\" and laughs. 

So ridiculous."}
{"text":"'Garlic Parmesan' boneless wings were way too greasy in my opinion.. 
Don't wanna sound picky, but the fries were kinda salty as well, but that's probably just me. 
Nonetheless I enjoyed their 'summer deal' 20 bucks for 20 wings, 2 drinks and 2 fries with the lady! Beast mode lol. And it always has me craving it for days after having it.. Boneless wings ftw. 
Oh and I love the remodeling they did, makin this place look way more spacious and welcoming. 
Wingstop wins"}
{"text":"Been here twice and have enjoyed it. Been to the one on Nellis and yea not so great. The fries here were fresh. I'm a big fry guy so yea. Wings were good also, nothing special. The one thing I really like about this place is the service, everyone is so welcoming, helpful, and will check up on you to see if everything is . Good job guys"}
{"text":"Great flavor sauces!  Decent bread to meat ratio for boneless!  Juicy meat!  Everything is cooked right in front of you to order! This is officially my favorite wing place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Maybe just my opinion but I've had much better wings!  Usually we get from ATL Wings, but they were closed early so we tried out wing stop.  I got the hot wings and they missed the mark on flavor and heat.  I really didn't care for the flavor of their hot sauce tasted weird to me, and they were not that spicy.  They were also soggy , I like my wings crispy!  Plus there was too much sauce sitting at the bottom of the container, maybe that's why they were soggy I'm not sure.  Along with soggy wings their fries are soggy as well and I don't know anyone who likes soggy fries!  So again it may just be my opinion but I really don't like the food here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly employees. Great wings.  Too much noise though. Loud radio playing with TVs on. Wings where over cooked and fries where under cooked. No garbage cans you leave it on the table."}
{"text":"We were immediately greeted by Josie who was wonderful! Unlike some wing places I've been to recently this stop was painless and actually fun. Will definitely be coming back soon. ASK FOR JOSIE!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent wings!!! First time here! I got the combo deal. Spicy Korean and the Original Hot. Both were crispy, meaty wings! The sauces were both very good choices. My husband got the lemon pepper rub which was a little salty and the Original Hot. Also happy with his choices. Lots of fries for the side of fries. Free refills on sodas too. $23 for two of us. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Hey I'm just happy there are Wing Stop locations here in Mesa.  Coming from Missouri,  we frequented Wing Stop. This looks like a nice clean location. The cashier was friendly and very helpful. The garlic wings are our favorite. Love the fries with honey mustard dressing. Can't wait to come back. Hopefully there are some locations in Queen Creek where we are moving to next week."}
{"text":"My friends and I went in tonight to get some wings on our way to work. The girl who took our order was just outright rude. She laughed at me for pronouncing a word wrong?? And when my friend asked if she could get the tenders flavored she rolled her eyes and replied \"uh yeah?\" Like sorry we all don't know how wing stop works? Definitely will not be returning. While we were waiting for our food another couple had been waiting for 40 minutes!!! And when our food was finally called out they got up and asked where theirs were. He replied \"well did you get bone in?\" They ended up just getting a refund and leaving. The lobby was downright disgusting, dirty tables everywhere and a pile of trash trays where they call out your order. Ew.
This place needs a wake up call on not only how to run an efficient store but also on how to treat their customers who let me remind you are the reason you guys are even in business."}
{"text":"It's nearly impossible to find good wings in Vegas. This place has decent sauces but they're way overpriced for some tiny wings with no meat on them."}
{"text":"It's a decent spot nothing to really brag about. The eating area could be kept a little cleaner two tables still had not been cleared but were  empty at the time we arrived. To get fast service its best to call ahead."}
{"text":"I love Wingstop and have found this location to be a good drive from my place. I have always only ordered online and picked it up, so I can't speak for service in-house. When I order online, I usually order my classic lemon pepper & louisiana rub wings. I've always been satisfied. The service is quick and has always been right on time, if not quicker, than the estimated pickup time stated on the online order. The staff I've interacted with have been helpful and service has been consistent."}
{"text":"So WingStop was always a favorite of mine and my sister's.  But that's all changed since she got like crazy sick! I feel bad too because I can tell she is not diggin' the way she feels. She ate WingStop with her friends last night and is now feeling like death. Food poisoning is a possible solution and I would't doubt it. The last time I was there I ordered the boneless bbq and hot wings and halfway through I noticed one of my wings wasn't cooked thoroughly. The breading was uncooked on the inside and not only that but there was dark spot on the chicken and breading. Better believe I was done with my food after seeing that! I hate to write this because I really love wings but after that occurrence and my sister feeling horribly sick I don't think we'll be going back. Just can't risk it. 
I think WingStop may need to hire more staff. Maybe then their food would get cooked to the proper temperature. I say that because every time I would go in there, one girl would be taking calls, orders, and making  sure that the cooks are making the right wings all at once. Might be the reason why some people didn't receive their correct order."}
{"text":"Ordered food at 5pm didn't get it till 6pm!!! ridiculous and then had to redo the fries again because they were cold don't go to this location they are slow when all we ordered was 30 wings half lemon pepper half mild wow!"}
{"text":"A great place to get a quick bite to eat. A note though though the wings are on the small side but, still are really good! I love this place"}
{"text":"When it comes to quick eats and chicken wings at that,  this place is bar none! Definitely the best wings I have had around this part of Charlotte. These wings will compete and beat many of the wings that are served in the big chain restaurants in the area. They really got something going on here. They should consider expanding and possibly serving beer on tap. Also, maybe adding some more televisions and just becoming a full on go-to restaurant for the best wings in Charlotte NC."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service  ordered food  was told about 11 minutes.  Was told they would see where my order was yet never was called out for it.  35 min later I went up to tell them I just wanted my money back. It had been sitting there for who knows how long.  The wings are ok but will stick with other choices from now on"}
{"text":"I hate coming to this location because they never get my order correct, after the third time of screwing my order up I contacted management and was offered - 5 free wings with my next order.....the wings are great but pass on this location or at the very least make sure you check your complete order before heading home and being disappointed like I was."}
{"text":"Well the reviews didn't lie, placed my phone order like an idiot and arrived to the store and you better believe they totally screwed up. Made a slight attempt to fix it but it was STILL incorrect. The store was damn near empty so they can't use the \"we were busy\" excuse this time. Then asked me if would like to pay for an order of the flavor I requested that they got wrong in my order. I asked was there a manager available..there wasn't - surprise, surprise.

Just avoid the trouble of going here and find something else to eat. I wasted $35 and don't want you doing the same.

*Management don't leave that bullshit message you've been leaving under most of these bad reviews here about forwarding the info to the store staff etc....offer replacement orders/credit when you screw up if you REALLY value what's being said here and correct your mistakes the FIRST TIME.

********So it's safe to assume their \"concerned\" comments are automated guys  they totally disregarded my statement about them making a statement and as you can see not a single offer to correct it********"}
{"text":"I don't know why it's taken me so long to leave a review for this place considering my greedy @ss is ALWAYS there but I love these guys, nice staff and management, order always ready to pickup in the time given when I call in and the one occasion my order was messed up management went out his way to fix it and make sure it was right that time.

The area isn't the best but there's always cops eating in there so I always feel safe when picking up my order."}
{"text":"3rd time placing an order with this location and this is their 3rd time messing it up... requested my wing EXTRA well done.....like my previous orders and i still received gummy \"usual\" cooked wings....hairy, half assed wings at that. 

I'll stick to Atl for wings or the other Wingstop location on 51st Ave but even that location is a crapshoot. It's a shame that you damn near have to stand over these people and hold their hands in order to get your wings prepared the way you specify ESPECIALLY considering wings are suppose to be something they specialize in."}
{"text":"I have gotten take out several times for dinner Today for lunch we ate in. Two People that came after us received their lunch first it took 25 min i finally went to the counter and asked how much longer the Hispanic man looked at me walked away and came back with my order. He didn't say one word to me, no apologizing at at. To make matters worse the wings were dripping in grease and tonight both of us have food poisoning and are sick."}
{"text":"Not a local but we've visited this Wingstop many times before! TODAY the chicken is grossly large and hormonal looking. I requested that chicken be cooked longer and it wasn't.  When we FINALLY got our 24 peice family pack the skin on the chicken was slimy! So I went to tell the young lady that took the order that the chicken wasn't cooked longer as I had requested. She goes and talk to another young lady and then comes back and tell me that it was cooked longer when clearly it wasnt. As one could see from my reviews I visit wingstops frequently and I know good food especially from Wingstop! This isnt it!!! The service was horrible. Wasn't in anyway trying to make it right! Save your money and go to another location. We were gonna take the remaining of our food back to the hotel with us but it was far too disgusting to even give to the homeless! #trashit #wasntwortheating or mymoney"}
{"text":"Man I love me some wings! Plus, I never knew how great Wingstop was until I moved out here to AZ. 

I think the reason why I really love this place is for their selection. I enjoy the traditional hot flavor, but I'm also a huge fan of the lemon pepper and garlic parmesan. When my buddies and I come here, we always get the family meal, which comes with a GRIP of food for only about $28. 

You get 35 wings (your choice of flavors), two large sides (we always just get double orders of fries), carrots/celery and 2 sides of ranch. And believe me, it's enough to FILL YOU UP!"}
{"text":"The 1st few months of that place opening it was great.  The manager there, literally took this place downhill. Ben there about 15x. 1 time it was great and She was working there. Skinny white lady! 2nd time it was good. Not great, but good. From 3-10xs it was ok.. last 3 times. Complete fail. Every time I came in she was there.  The last 2 times where a nightmare.  I ordered 5 citrus blaze 5 garlic 5 lemon pepper 5 boneless citrus. And fries. Got to Westlake and oil spilled all over my car. Opend the only box they gave me and there was 7 lemon pepper 5 garlic 1 citrus and 1 boneless citrus. And a basket of half cooked fries. I called and they said oh we thought you ordered 1 and 1. You would be surprised how many people call and order just 1. I said ok. So where is the rest. I drove all the way back from Westlake and gave them there food back. And I promise I'll never step foot in there ever again that lady manager they have is tearing this place up.  Sadly.. she belongs at a McDonald's drive thru on the midnight shift.  With the attitude she has. Horrible. Don't go there please you will regret it. Nasty ass food oily and not even cooked all the way. Looks like crack was taking her face over. Basically a Skelton managing wing stop on Lorain rd Cleveland Ohio."}
{"text":"I order from Wingstop about every 2 weeks through their app and I love the food. The bone in and boneless wings are great, I am not a fan of the tenders. I like Wing Stop because I prefer dry rub seasonings on my wings and the selection here is pretty good. I usually get the garlic parmesan and lemon pepper flavors. I also partake in the original spicy but that is as hot as I can stand.

As for sides, they aren't impressive or worth the calories. The fries are soggy, even if you order them extra crispy."}
{"text":"This is my usual go to wing place, but recently they have been getting my order wrong and being short on wings,  I come back and let the girl at the counter know and she just takes my receipt and walks to the back no smile no apology just \"oh \".  They need to work on customer service"}
{"text":"I loved their garlic Parmesan chicken wings and I always request extra crispy. Excellent service, clean environment & Great location."}
{"text":"I tried wing stop after delivering it to a customer when I was postmating. It was surprisingly delicious. I got the Hawaiian and mango wings and thought both were excellent."}
{"text":"Two very nice ladies assisted us with our orders.  I had a coupon that I had misread and they were very kind to change my order with no issues. The food was given to us fast and hot. They mistakenly forgot a side order of mine. Promptly called me back and gave me the option to come back now or get the side for free on my next visit. I went right back and they upgraded my side order to a large for free! Food was awesome of course! They are very nice at this location! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Absolute garbage!!! Ordered 50 wings for my Halloween party around 11 am. I set my pick up time for 5:30, when I arrived NOTHING READY!! They chose to tell me this after I payed. Their bull crap excuse was that my pickup time means that's when they start making the order. The place only had me and one other customer. They had so much free time that they were fooling around in the back when I arrived. When I asked for the manager I had to laugh he didn't even look like he worked their at all, he was dressed like a hooligan. Then they had the nerve to ask if I can wait until 6. I'm definitely calling corporate!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered 25 boneless wings with three different flavors that were all terrible. Southern bbq, teriyaki and mango habanero. All three flavors had 10 times the amount of seasoning needed, to the point where i couldn't eat them. The voodoo fries were inedible, soggy, cold and disgusting. I had also ordered baked beans, rolls, a brownie and cole slaw, all of which were LEFT OUT of the order. I will never be a customer of Wingstop ever again."}
{"text":"Terrible service and rude staff. 
Never coming here again. 
In a rush to get home and can't even take the time to help the  customers how it should be done. 
Very slow service."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, I haven't gone in a couple months because my experience was horrible. I ordered 6 lemon pepper WITH bone... I get my order and drive home, open it up and it was chicken without the bone. If I wanted some chicken nuggets I would have went to mcdonalds. So I call wingstop, and I bring my order back in.. I'm waiting about 10 minutes to get my re order, then the lady comes out with BUFFALO wings.. how do you get buffalo when I said lemon pepper? So I'm waiting another 10 minutes for my order and they finally got it right the 3rd time, but almost forgot to put fries in my bag. After all that, they didn't offer to give me my money back considering the fact I drove all the way home and had to come back, plus my order was wrong 3 times. Or they could have given me a free meal for next time. Make sure to always check your bag before leaving if you're not going to eat there. Chicken is good, but they need to get their orders correct. Plus they have way to many people working at this location. Must have a great job not having to do anything all day except stand around and talk. Maybe that's why you guys get orders wrong."}
{"text":"Great wings. I was given everything I asked for and more. Not great fries and they had no spice. Kinda limp but I like mine crispy and will ask them to do that next time. Loved the ranch and the celery and carrots were fresh. The service was top notch. I had never been there before and the young man was very helpful. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to carry out one Friday night after my trip to the liquor store next door.

I ordered 10 boneless wings, half with the lemon pepper and half with the original hot sauces.

The \"sauces\" are more like seasonings. These wings are not dripping in sauce like Buffalo Wild Wings, but they actually aren't too dry either, which was my main concern. 

The wings themselves seemed to be of decent quality. Both of the sauces were tasty, though I did think both the lemon pepper and the original hot were very salty. 

The wings themselves are quite small. I ordered 10 for myself and was still very hungry after that. At about $1/wing, I thought them to be overpriced for the amount of food I got. Knowing that Buffalo Wild Wings has a comparable wing for literally half the price on Thursdays, I think I would be more inclined to go there.

The cashier was friendly and Wing Stop is open a little later than most other places."}
{"text":"My co-worker recommend me to try wingstop. But I feel I like buffalo wild wings more. The chicken wings tasted fine just too dry"}
{"text":"On 07/29/17, I went to this wingstop at 11:40pm and the door was already locked. Several employees looked in my direction without anyone coming to the door. The Open sign was still turned on. The hours of operation state until midnight therefore the doors should remain open until that timeframe."}
{"text":"UPDATED May 2015: I am lowering my review from 5 to 4 stars, because they cannot seem to get to-go orders correct. Once, I arrived when instructed only to find out my order had not even been started because they ran out of paper in their printer, so I had to sit for the 16 minute cook time. On multiple occasions, my online orders were incomplete - missing sauces, wrong veggie sticks, and once even missing fries. I don't understand how this can happen so regularly since the online orders come to them in a printout, so there's no mixup from being on a phone. But orders are more wrong more correct these days. It's quite frustrating because their wings are the best in Gilbert - they certainly beat Buffalo Wild Wings.

Original review:

I just discovered this store, and went three times in a month! The prices are good, the wings are delicious, and they're cooked nice and crispy (but no breading). The amount of sauce is subtle, much like the original Anchor Bar in Buffalo, NY. Franky, I think Wingstop ranks up there with the masters; they're certainly way better than Buffalo Wild Wings. I am a purist so I prefer the original mild & hot, but they do have some unique flavored rubs and sauces for the variety.

The fries are alright but the seasoning includes sugar, so if they're over-seasoned they become sweet and inedible; keep it in mind when ordering. And this is really minor, but I wish they'd include paper towels at every table instead of the single roll for the entire restaurant. Finally - $2 beer on Tuesday & Friday (as of September 2014), which is quite the deal considering they have some quality beers available."}
{"text":"We love this location, the staff their are always nice and the food is the best. We prefer the family pack so we can all get the flavors we like the boneless wings are the best. Also the french fries are so good, we always have to get extra because by the time we get them home they are almost gone. The wings also reheat good so we always get extra so we can have them for another day."}
{"text":"My son requested chicken wings from here for his birthday since he loves wings. We hesitantly agreed to it because we have never been. Downloaded their app to order and got $5.00 worth of wings free( yay) we ordered about $40.00 worth of wings and got 4 different flavors. That's about 60 wings total. Although the wings were alright, there just wasn't enough sauce. We thought they were a bit too dry. We were specially disappointed with the buffalo flavored wings. They tasted more like flavored fried chicken than wings. Don't know if these wings had just been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time or if this is how they are supposed to be but we just really didn't care to find out. Needless to say we have since then deleted the app and will probably never be back. From now on we will be ordering from a place that serves sauce with their wings."}
{"text":"My husband is excited that we have a Wingstop close by. I am... not quite so enthused because all of their wings are breaded so there are no options for me to eat there; I cut small pieces of two wings that he ordered, just to be able to taste and review.

My husband's main complaint was that it took him 15 minutes to get food. He described the restaurant as one with evident \"growing pains\": a manager in the back who yelled nonstop, and general chaos among the staff. However, the food was still perfectly hot when my husband brought it home, so there is that.

He really liked the fries. They looked well-seasoned and crisp. He ordered an assortment of three kinds of boneless wings. I didn't try the atomic. The teriyaki didn't have a very strong flavor and the breading was awfully thick, while the lemon pepper did have a pleasant lemony taste. The chicken meat looked to be of a good quality.

My husband didn't tell me what he paid for his meal, but I found the takeout menu he brought home. YIKES. Wingstop is awfully expensive for what you get, and for such slow service, too.

I certainly won't encourage him to go here again, but I imagine he'll drop by nevertheless. He'd get a lot more for his time and money if he went into the deli at the nearby Fry's or Walmart."}
{"text":"Wingstop was a last minute decision that was made for dinner. I haven't had wings from there in a few years. The location I used to go to was rather slow and I didn't want to have to wait as if I were being waited on at a sit down restaurant. Went in and ordered and put food was ready within 10 minutes. 25 wings two fries and tenders all within a timely manner and I was on my way. Quite please that when I got home my food was still very hot and my wings had plenty sauce on them. Not to mention there were three ranch dips in the bag as well. No complaints here! Keep it up Wingstop."}
{"text":"This is the best wing spot in town.  The wings have the best flavor and there Ranch is awesome.  Not the cheapest place to eat with a large family but worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"Second stop and wait for an eternity. I went next door. Ordered food. Got my order and came back. Still waiting. They lost their second star. Same rude teller slash cashier method. 

Tastes great. Very filling for a combo. Everything else needs improvement. The server interrupted me and didn't answer my questions. She was more worried about the name for the order. If its an obligation technique it didn't work on the old lady behind me. She laughed and said this place was over priced. It was awkward and unnecessary to rudely ask my name for an order I haven't placed yet. Then I waited twenty minutes for my food.  I do have places to be. Its supposed to be a wing stop. Not a rooster-nest. Yes they are clean and friendly but awkward, expensive and slow. I'll check back in again to see if the wait, server was a fluke. The prices don't seem like they will change anytime soon.

Also note not vegetarian friendly. No fish, nor healthy choices for drinks. But a large American selection of beer."}
{"text":"The good thing about chain restaurants? They're all pretty consistent.

Was craving Wingstop's Garlic Parmesan wings and their awesome house fries. Ordered an order of the Garlic Parmesan and Lemon Pepper wings to share along with fries. They also had a Yelp Check-In offer for 5 boneless bites which was cool.

The wings tasted the same as any other location, crispy and flavorful. Fries were filling and plentiful. Typical to wait at least 15 minutes or so for them to cook the chicken, but not bad.

Interesting set of people that come in here however, so be wary of that."}
{"text":"It's a good thing there isn't a Wingstop close to where I live, otherwise I'd go there all the time.  This one has a Coke machine, where you can choose from a ton of different flavor combinations.  They also have seltzer water, if you're like me and think soda is too sweet.  My combo when I went was seltzer water and a splash of Mello Yellow Peach.

We split the 15 wing deal, got extra crispy lemon pepper and teriyaki.  They always give you a lot of fries, and I never finish it.  

Just like other Wingstops I've been to this place is small, and I always worry about getting a table when I come here.  This time no problem on a Sunday night.

As we sat down we saw the family next to us had ordered some kind of potato chip goodness with cheese sauce over it.  Have to try that next time."}
{"text":"Wing stop would definitely be a better review if the would get the service and flow of this location right . There were so many customers waiting,  coming back because something was missing , or just lost lol. 

If you don't care about any of the above statements,  and just want some good wings then this is your spot.  We ordered a family pack of 30 wings, mixing it up with garlic parmesan , honey bbq, and traditional hot wings , we chose all drums but they couldn't accommodate our request , giving us 20 drums and 10 flats.  Why have the option if you can't do it ? Yet they still charged us for doing all drums? The order was accompanied by large fries , which were yummy as well. All inall , tasty, yes , but would I come back? Probably not . It's too far from where I live, and it's too unorganized.  Too many wing spots in Charlotte to make this a favorite ."}
{"text":"This wing stop gives the franchise a very bad look . 

1)  Don't try calling , they don't pick up if they do it's after you've called 3-4 times minimum.

2) The service is slower than that last bit of dish soap you're waiting to come down so you can say you used it all and got your money's worth . 

3) After the hour and a half wait for your order the fries are soggy , the boneless wings barely covered in sauce , and they forgot part of your order. 

I'm so disappointed because I love Wing stop ."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of this location for a while and do to the convenience of it being around the corner it was awesome! Recently though the customer service and quality of food has declined severely. On our last visit we placed a phone order. They took our order and told us it would be around 15 min. We didn't leave the house for at least 15 min since it is literally 1 minute away. We pay and they tell us it will be a few minutes?? Alright still fine since I would rather have fresh wings and fries. Well we sit and wait for 30 min and nothing. Finally another 5 min go by and the girl, which seemed to be the manager grabs a bag that has been sitting on a shelf since we arrived and calls out our name. My wife grabs it and it is cold, she does a quick SMH thing and the employee gives her a nasty look. We take them home and 9 out of the 12 wings are ok, but the rest umm not so good. Nasty fatty, way too breaded chicken. Not a bash on all locations but this one really stinks. Very rude and unprofessional service."}
{"text":"Hello friends, 

Simple and plain
LEMON PEPPER WINGS

Monday & Tuesday boneless wing special price which i believe is 60 cents. Unlike a lot of other \"wing\" spots. Their boneless wings are all fluff. They are meaty, and when I say meaty i mean most meat and less batter. 

Anyway back to the wings. They have a flavor called LEMON PEPPER if I haven't mentioned it before. It makes me think of heaven when i eat them or at least what I want heaven to be like. 

Well you get the point. This is their Newest location other being in the University Area. This location seems a bit more airy than the other one. Which means you won't walk out smelling like fried wings. 

Go enjoy, 
TTFN"}
{"text":"Hello friends,

Two words.. Monday & Tuesday. Half off boneless wings. I love thier lemon pepper (a la Rick Ross). You can call in you order for pick up, order at the front for take out or dine in. I'm usually picking up 20 wings (real wings or boneless) and a order of fries before I go I work. 

Fries?? Did somebody say Fries? Yes, yes I did. If you like fresh cut fries. This is the place. If you like that burger joint that givess you wayyyyyy to many. These are in the same lane. GOOD!!! They have the malt vinegar to go along with it. Ummmmm 

It's in a strip mall (ohhh nooooo) tucked away in the corner. They're open til 12:00AM. I'm not sure about this location but the one in Pineville used to sell beer as well. 

Today is Monday which means....... See my 1st sentence.

Go enjoy!

{"text":"chicken lovers just love wingstop! you just can't stop the loveee!! 

AMBIANCE: 5 - they have actually expanded to include more seats and flat screens to the left of the register! most people like to sit in and eat because they're eager and hungry!!! 

SERVICE: 5 - fast and efficient! they are accurate and really good at getting orders done. we do takeout all the time, and sometimes they are a few min late, but it's not a big deal! 

FOOD: 5 - I've eaten so much chicken that i think I've grown wings..I recommend garlic parm and Louisiana rub with ranch! no other flavors need recognition :) 

but I give this a 4 because I feel like their fries are really lacking something in quality. they should pass out dinner rolls instead lol."}
{"text":"My favorite WingStop location in Vegas. Chicken is always cooked very well and I ordered their fries with extra seasoning and wasn't charged for it. My brother and I went when it was busy and waited 15 minutes to get our food which was pretty fast for how many people were in there, just in case though I would recommend calling in your order. 
The staff is friendly and they keep in clean. I saw at least 2 people cleaning the whole time we were there. 
5/5"}

The staff is usually pretty prompt and very friendly and being close to the house is never a bad idea.  The variety of flavors is perfect for me, as I don't care for anything too hot that I can't enjoy, but the Louisiana rub has got me hooked so far.  Can't go wrong with the wings here"}
{"text":"Horrible experience  called and ordered a 30 piece wing last night at 11:05.. they close at 12... The African American lady answered the phone and was complaining that I was putting in such a large order late. It was only 11:05?!! I told her I would cancel my order but she said no it's fine what do you want. When I get there, the African American cook was so rude. He screams all annoyed, \" ORDERING OR PICK UP?! ORDERING OR PICKUP?!\" My boyfriend goes on to say we are picking up... Then the African American lady exclaims, \"Good because we ain't taken any more orders.\" It was only 11:25.... they close at 12. We get our food and the cook goes on again and is complaining how the kitchen is a mess again and he isn't going to clean it because he doesn't care and that the morning employees will just be mad he doesn't care. 
I felt so uncomfortable there and I honestly felt nervous to eat my food, he was so mad I thought he might have done something to our food. After reading other reviews these 2 African American workers have received other terrible reviews. Why are you keeping them around? It's ridiculous. Not happy."}
{"text":"When wings are your specialty, you gotta do that right.....right? Last time we ordered from here the wait time was at least double what we were told. As I picked up my food at the takeout window the employees called out my items as they bagged them. I appreciate when restaurants do this and I felt everything was in the bag.

Drove home, unpacked the order. We were missing a large fry and an order of wings. Okay....I'll call them back. As I got into the food I found that the wings were greasy, small, several of the wings had broken bones. The flavor was good, but the wings were so diminutive it was sad. Spent $50 on the order.....extremely underwhelmed.

When you specialize in WINGS, maybe you should ensure you are getting a good product from your vendors. I can go to the Pizza Peel in Cotswold and get wings that are flavorful, meaty.....and they're a pizza place!!! 

Great location and I hope they make some improvements, until then I'm going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Meaty wings, bland sauces. I don't like a whole lot of spice on my wings, so ordered the mild and the garlic parm, but still expected SOME flavor...not so much. I made my own sauce and tossed the wings in them- much better. Good quality chicken. Avoid the fries."}
{"text":"The chicken was good but the sauce on them was not my favourite. too much salt on the fries. the service was good."}
{"text":"I will usually avoid getting wings from anywhere else except here. The dry rubs are finger lickin' good, especially the Lemon Pepper and Louisiana Dry Rub. 

The price is pretty steep though. It cost me $16 for 12 wings, fries, and a small drink. YIKES. But their fries are totally worth it and their wings are fairly well sized. 

I only come when I'm craving good wings. My pocket burns, but my tummy agrees."}
{"text":"Our family's go to wing place. Stopped by last night and ordered our usual family pack: 30 pcs lemon pepper wings, large fries and veggie sticks. Service was prompt though the place was hopping due to Sunday night football. It's such a  casual and relax place to hang out with the family, the hooting and grumbles of fans adds excitement to the place without being too rowdy. All in all a solid place to chill at if you're craving delicious wings and a sports fan."}
{"text":"I visited Wing Stop again after 9 months or so. It was as good as I remembered only less so as in it wasn't that good last time and was less good this time I tried the Cajun sauce and I don't really know what it is supposed to be but it was kind of hot and kind of buffalo sauce and kind of jerk-herby and hard to pin down like this sentence it was a little aimless in it's flavor and just didn't do much for me so this was probably my last visit to Wing Stop.  Yup."}
{"text":"I attended a Yelp event not too long ago at the Wing Stop and I have to admit that I'm a wing aficionado.  My daughter Muff and my sister become agitated every time I order wings around them.  Let me explain.  I like my wings thoroughly cooked.  Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  If I detect rubbery skin, I am not a happy camper.  I usually I provide very specific instructions on how to prepare my wings, which drives my family and dining companions nuts.  They're like, \"Come on already!  Just order the damn wings and let the cooks do their job!\"  Humph!  If I'm paying, I have a right to ask that my food be prepared a certain way.

Anywho, since I was a guest at an event, I couldn't provide instructions on how my meal should be prepared and I didn't need to.  The wings that I tasted were delicious.  Additionally, many places that specialize in wings generally have sides that don't measure up to their wings.  Not here!  The seasoned fries were scrumptious, as well as the baked beans.  And I'm a ranch dressing with fresh cut fries person, so their home made ranch dressing was right up my alley.  The revelation?  The potato salad!  The potato salad tasted like someone's Nana or Auntie was in the back slicing and dicing ingredients to make you feel like you were at home.  Yazzz!

Everything was really yummy.  I hope that they open a spot not too far from me, as promised.  I have been to other wing spots and have tasted varying degrees of properly prepared wings.  At the Wing Stop, not only do you get properly prepared wings, you get well prepared side dishes that can stand on their own.  Yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"Great food and great environment. Staff is great. The prices are reasonable


Came with family and friends. Awesome times"}
{"text":"Went to this location on 2-17-18 and this place was horrible! 3 out of 5 ended up sick. The boneless chicken wasn't cooked all the way. We will NOT be visiting this location again. If I could give this a -5 I would but since I can't a 1 will have to do."}
{"text":"Today I was craving chicken wings. I always heard good things about Wingstop so I decided to give it a try. 
Upon entering, I was greeted. The young lady taking my order was very nice and patient with me (I did take kinda awhile to order since it was my first time). 
After, we went to go sit down to wait for our order. Immediately she came to make sure the table was clean for us. The entire dining area was clean. There were flat screen TVs set up everywhere with the basketball game on, which my boyfriend liked. Our order only took no more than 10 minutes to come out, which is nice considering its freshly made. We took our food to go.
We got the half-half family back, which is half bone-in and half boneless, 24 total, with 4 choices of flavor, 4 sides of ranch or bleu cheese, fries, and veggie sticks. 
Overall the bone-in wings were very oily, with a puddle of oil in our to go box. The lemon pepper was okay, and the Louisiana rub lacked flavor. 
For our boneless, we got more lemon pepper, and mango habanero. Maybe it's the Korean in me, but the mango habanero was definitely not as spicy as they made it seem and the flavor didn't satisfy my craving. 
It was good to try, but ehhh wasn't the best. 
Giving a 3 star rating because they had great customer service, and a nice dining environment."}
{"text":"I'm not digging this place at all. Maybe because I'm so use to Buffalo Wild Wings but experience of the customer service could've change that, but no it was horrible, little kids are working at the register, was super late for my wings, waited 20-25 mins for a 10 piece & found out that they gave the order to someone else. So I waited another 15 to 20 minutes to get the wings. Three hours later I'm in the restroom begging or mercy. I think this place need a visit from the health department ASAP."}
{"text":"Me and the wife decide to try this place since it just opened up and right down the street from the house.

So far we have sampled the boneless wings and the fries. Both were amazing. We tried BBQ, Lemon, and the Original. All three sauces were good. 

A large fry is a very generous size. The dips are a great price for the size, and depending on what you order are sometimes included. 

Ordering online makes a nice easy trip to pick it up, both times my order was ready early.The staff was super friendly for both my stops. I hope this place stays open and grows in this location.

So if you haven't tried this place et give it a shot I think you will like it."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent. We got a few flavors.. I'm a Buffalo Wild Wings girl so I was turned off when my fianc√© mentioned it but gave it a try any ways. The hot flavored was horrible. Even my fianc√© didn't like it. The bbq was the best flavor we got and the lemon pepper was bad. The fries were just ok and what pissed me off was I specifically went in there and asked could I pay for extra ranch (3 to be exact) and yet they still only put one in there. If it wasn't for my phone dying I would have called up there and asked for a refund! But I also should have checked my bag. Anyway it was just alright"}
{"text":"People say Wingstop is so great, but I went to this one, and I'd have to say I don't get it.  Neat decor with the oldschool flight theme, and cozier less terribly noisy environment than BWW.  Wings were large and meaty.  But sauces just weren't very interesting."}
{"text":"Great wings ! Good customer service very friendly and clean will definitely be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place out they said order would take 17 minutes wings were all dried out like they were re cooked don't think I will be back"}
{"text":"I was expecting an experience similar to BW3s, but that is not what I got. 

The Parmesan garlic wings do not have sauce on them, but are instead soaked in butter with Parmesan cheese sprinkled over top. Totally disgusting.  Their menu doesn't even mention that it isn't a sauce. 

The fries also have a weird sugary sweet kind of thing going on. They weren't very good.

I couldn't get through more than a few bites of each.

It's possible that the wings that actually have sauce (though the menu doesn't point out which those are) might be better, but I will never know...

I won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Horrible wait time I called ahead they said to order would be ready in 24 minutes it ended up taking over 40 minutes meanwhile a guy walks in with in seven minutes they havehis food up and ready faster  so I will never come here again should not take 40 minutes for fries and wings. They did nothing like offer a drink or anything just all around bad service time

For a word of advice walk in apparently get better quicker service then a call of 24mins and waiting in the lobby another 15"}
{"text":"I love WingStop! In my book, it's just as good as BWW, and it's closer to my house. 

They have great regular and boneless wings in addition to awesome seasoned fries. The fries are seasoned with some crack filled flavoring. (Disclaimer: I'm only assuming they have crack on them, I don't know what crack would actually taste like.) The service is always good. Prices are totally reasonable. The sauces here are more limited than BWW, but I love the parmesan garlic!!! If you get these, you should get another style as well, because they are pretty strongly garlic (obviously) flavored. 

I look at it like, if you just want the wings to go, then WingStop is a great choice. But should you want to actually stay and watch the game with some buddies, then BWW is the winner. Monday and Tuesday they have a 50 cent boneless wing special. If you love wings, give em a try."}
{"text":"Ordered into my room at the Homewood.  Confusion on the phone over what they did or didn't have available.  I had already had a light meal at the hotel, so I only wanted to order appetizers and a dessert.  It was on the company, so I ordered cheese sticks, mushrooms and banana cheesecake bites

Everything seems to be overly breaded and overseasoned and I'm guessing a frozen, bought in product.  The banana cheesecake things were awful and both the mushrooms and cheese sticks were so heavily breaded that I made efforts to remove as much as possible.

Throw in a 20oz coke and delivery charge, I spent more than $20 for food I mostly tossed because of poor quality.  Next time I'll just get in the car and head out"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best wings in town for sure! The boneless wings are perfectly breaded and sauced! If you like spicy, I def recommend the mango habanero. Can never go wrong with this location."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes for 10 wings. And then they weren't cooked long enough and they were lacking in flavor. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Just came in to pick up my order and was greeted by one person who appeared to have just finished eating something, who wasn't able to assist since she just cashed out.  Said the other employee was going to have to help, well she was on her cell phone, never greeted just stood there waiting for her to finish her call. Once she was done, no apology for the wait or the fact that she was on the phone. Just handed me my slip to sign while she was hollering something to someone else in Spanish.  Then proceeded to give me the incorrect number of drink cups. Asked for a drink holder response given with attitude. Then proceeded to crumble up my receipt, which I needed. Been here before never had service like this."}
{"text":"We eat here at least twice a week, my friends and I may have a problem...

You only need to know two words:  Louisiana.  Rub.

That is all."}
{"text":"Pretty sure you ALL have had Wingstop before LOL.  If not, they are a pretty solid wing spot to get some grub...probably my favorite CHAIN wing restaurant!

I tried the Hot, Garlic Parmesan, and BBQ this time...all sauced up and tasty.  TOO much sauce actually...I was scraping the BBQ sauce off, since it was poured so thick lol.  Better too much than not enough I guess.

The wings are cooked perfectly, juicy, and flavorful.  Really enjoy their fries here...cut up home style with the skins....yum :)

A little spendy though...think we spent around $24 for 24 wings and some fries.  Almost $1 each at that rate with no drinks.

Gotta pay to play I guess!  At least while you're in Sante Fe :P"}
{"text":"Tha wings are good, but the employees are morons! 
Every location I go to the employees R fucking incompetent!
WTF! Wing stop, pay employees better and get people who are not illiterate!"}
{"text":"10 piece bone-in wings, original hot. That's my order every time I eat here. The wings always have that perfect amount of heat that makes my mouth burn and feel heavenly at the same time. The wings here are usually pretty big compared to some wing places I've been to. They each have just the right amount of sauce on them and a good amount of meat. Now let's move on to the good part...

THE FRIES!  The fries here are soo delicious. The seasoning they use makes the fries so addicting. I always save them for last because they're my favorite part of the meal.  Quick tip though: if you don't like salt, stay away from them."}
{"text":"I only ordered 8 pieces of chicken and I swear I been here forever. All those people in the back there's no reason to that damn slow. Also why is this location prices higher than any other location. I will still continue to come because it's up the street, but really a whole dollar more on some things."}
{"text":"We've never had an order we weren't satisfied with here. The staff was happy to double check the allergens in their sauces as well. Ask for your wings and fries well done- game changer!"}
{"text":"Great wings! I've loved all that I've tried. However it does seem overpriced and at this particular location they are terrible at customer service. The huge long waits don't help matters either."}
{"text":"Amazing staff! Amazing wings! Amazing fries! Amazing ranch! We love eating here. Being honest, at least once a week. The staff are so friendly. We feel at home here. Ordering is simple and quick. We love the Habanero Mango flavor. Strongly recommend to try these. We like the fact that the place is always kept clean and that sports are always on TV."}
{"text":"Not bad. Wings are always good. Staff seems a little unhappy but overall not a bad wing place."}
{"text":"First time to this location.  Was really impressed with the staff, cleanliness and how good and quick the food came out. We tried the new Brazilian dry rub and the normal Atomic.  Both were great.  If you like wings and a great atmosphere for a quick meal.  Come check this place out."}
{"text":"When you order pick up you would think they have it ready when you go to pick up no they hold your order then decide to throw it in when you get there there's no point in ordering ahead of time poor service  and no manager on duty"}
{"text":"This place is so good the chicken is great . I always get the lemon lime and the fries are to die for yes I said it . I always love how the servers have a great attitude they actually interact with you all the time and make you feel  comfortable . The place is always clean. Also"}
{"text":"I always come here and never had a problem. Today my boyfriend signed up for their wingstop club and we got our email stating that we had a free fries with any purchase . When we didn't print it out because it was not on our voucher to print the coupon out the manager on duty Vanessa refused to honor the coupon. She even noticed that it did not state print on our coupon and still didn't honor it. That honestly has been the worse service I have ever received at a wingstop. Please be aware that you have to print the fries coupon or else they will not accept it !"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood today and decided to give the place another shot... the wait for the food is a little unnerving. .. but when I finally received my order, the fries were the hit. .. the wings. .. just like any other wings however ... there really needs to be a faster way to complete and deliver orders. ..especially if you are dining in on a lunch break. .. The fries...!?  Very good recipe. .perhaps the best in  Charlotte"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Buddy of mine walked in @ 11:16 and two workers were leaning up against the bar, watched us walk in and did not acknowledge the fact we walked in. We waited  few minutes until someone came from the back. Terrible customer service. The worker then began to work the register after first ignoring patrons. I live in LA and have WS @ least 2X a week and never have I had this kind of customer service before."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check this spot out because we were in the area. The young ladies at the counter were very pleasant and efficient. The food is good, especially the lemon pepper wings. My only concern is that the chef was dropping wings in the grease with his bare hands.  When my husband commented about it, the chef put on gloves. I will not boycott an establishment just because one person was off their game BUT please get him together. Part of the charm of an open kitchen is being able to see your food being prepared fresh. Let's try to do that AND follow health inspector guidelines."}
{"text":"AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by EVERY SINGLE employee! With a smile too!!! & it wasn't sarcastic. Everyone was genuinely nice. Food came out bomb! Like always. But I will definitely be going here more often. The manager was really nice & cool too!! Forgot to get their names but you guys are SUPER COOL!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Wingstop wings. I honestly would have them in any city that I visit. Lol That being said, this location as far as service has really gone downhill. It's sad. Wings are still solid, but the service is subpar."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings around. It's nice to be able to order good wings as takeout, because then at least you don't have to tip someone.

They also offer a 10% discount to military, police, fire department."}
{"text":"My husband love wing stop.  I don't because I don't eat meat. But I do love their customer service."}
{"text":"Wings Beer & great service! This is the only wingstop that has a bar service! The Bar area has about 6-7 seating bar stools. If you don't drink there is enough seating in the dinning area. PBR cold on tap for just a dollar! You can't Say no to that deal!! They got coke soft drinks with all other types of sodas to choose from. Me and my wifey enjoy coming here when we craving some wings and drinks! They treat you well and remember your name. Yes they get busy and have lots of to go orders. Morgan and Paola are the best!! I get all flats lemon peeper & Wifey orders flats Louisiana rub with some honey mustard, you got to love their signature ranch! They also started making some cheese fries with other toppings u love! This wingstop rocks! If your not happy with the cook tell Morgan she will make sure to fix your order and get you what you need!"}
{"text":"This place is open until Midnight everyday! (at least the North Las Vegas location) They have better wings than Buffalo Wild Wings, and the prices are reasonable. They also have a cool beverage dispenser where I can mix and match all different types of sodas. Probably like over 60 drinks.

You can get boneless or classic (bone-in) wings in the following amounts:
8pc - $6.49 (2 flavors)
12pc- $9.69 (2 flavors)
20pc- $15.99 (2 flavors)
30pc- $23.99 (3 flavors)
50pc- $39.99 (4 flavors)

They also have family packs and meals for two. www.wingstop.com

Wing Flavors are (Top down hottest to mild):
ATOMIC (I warn you... don't even get this unless you want to prank someone lol)
CAJUN
ORIGINAL HOT
LOUISIANA RUB
MILD
HICKORY SMOKED BBQ (probably my favorite)
LEMON PEPPER (I recommend this, it's a dry seasoning though)
GARLIC PARMESAN
HAWAIIAN
TERIYAKI"}
{"text":"I have to say I was unpleasantly surprised, for this being wing specialty place. These wings were not big in fact they were downright tiny. The taste was okay but not great. I will continue my quest for tasty wings."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new wing place open up nearby, but wS not impressed with the 20 pack of wings I got.
-  fries were good tasting, but too salty.
- garlic parmesan wings were tossed is a   
   salty powder with no garlic flor what so 
   ever. I could only eat 1 out of the 8.
- Hawaiian flavor was good.
- Teriyaki flavor was good but salty.
- The other problem was the thick heavy 
   breading on the boneless wings.
 Overall I was not too impressed. 
If the cut down on the salt and used fresh garlic insteAd of powder, maybe I would return. 
I will say the online order was easy and the order was ready when promised."}
{"text":"Same as all other wing stops which is kind of comforting. It was nice to get off the strip for some east tasty food. Near Walgreens and easy to get to and easy to park. Great soda machine with tons of options."}
{"text":"Fresh and Hot!  Good wings with about a dozen different flavors.  Everything is made to order.  Was quoted, \"It will be 14 minutes till your order is ready\".  Fresh hand cut fries.  Homemade slaw or baked beans.  The fries and beans were good.  Did not try the slaw.  Tried the mild and the Louisiana rub wings  Both were good but enjoyed the Louisiana a little more.  You get a choice of Ranch, Blue Cheese or Honey Mustard as a dip.  Had the blue cheese and it is blue cheese in ranch dressing so it has the chive flavor; would have preferred it without the chive flavor. 

The service was super friendly and helpful.  Explained the menu and all the options.  They also clean the tables when you are done."}
{"text":"They are building one of these places by where I live. And I had to find out if it was any good while in Vegas. I was very impressed with the food we had. The boneless wings are nicely breaded with the perfect amount of sauce. But the thing I wasn't prepared for was the bone in wings. They use a dry rub for all of them. And at first I thought I usually only like saucy wings? But these were really good! I hope the location going in by me does everything the same. I will be going a lot if they do."}
{"text":"Lets just say I'm leaving here 100% satisfied and stuffed. We ordered some Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan, and Mild wings. DELICIOUS! Also don't forget those fries and even the blue cheese is above par. There is a soda machine with over 100 drink choices, the future is here. Took about 20 minutes to get the food which is good considering the place was busy. Till next time Wing Stop."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible service, they say they are OPEN until 12:00am but we pull up at 11:30 and they're already locking the doors saying \"we're closed, sorry\" like come on .. if anything 11:50 or 11:55 start closing . But 11:30!? And that's just when we pulled up y'all probably closed down because you had no service around 11! Don't do that you never know who'll want something last-minute! Ughh disappointing. Should've just stayed in the long in-and-out line ... instead of trying to get something I heard was good ."}
{"text":"Brought my friend for the first time here and from the minute we walked in we got great customer service. Very friendly staff and I will probably come here over Buffalo Wild Wings from now on. The gentleman worked with us and gave us an extra flavor and let us pay half and half on our bill. Two thumbs up for this location. Justin and Steve will make you feel like family and had us laughing the whole time! New wing spot for us!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  They are always friendly and the food is good.  I like the new expansion, it looks good.  The location is conveniently located."}
{"text":"Always super quick and polite. Where I order there or call it in. Good amount of food for a decent price."}
{"text":"This location needs to get it together. Every time I come here, I wait MORE than 30 minutes for a very simple 8 pc order. On one occasion, it took them about 45 minutes for lunch and I was late getting back to work. I decided to go last night, but I order takeout just so I don't have to deal with waiting long amounts of time. I should have checked the bag because of course the order was wrong and they forgot my salad. But I live 20 min away so I lost out on my money. I'm so tired of this Location. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Has a welcoming greeting. Great place for sitting in and enjoying your food. Aside from that it is always well taken care up to date clean. Best part can be on how they keep the food coming out in time never really have to wait. I would say they have my favor kind of wing better then Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"This is the only wingstop I go to here in Vegas and its decent! Sometimes they take a little long with the orders but other than that everything's all good!"}
{"text":"So glad for the henderson location. Online ordering made simple and very accurate. Wings were delicious. Ordered fries but would of liked then a bit more well done. I cant stress enough to order line since it gives you options on how to organize which wings and sauces you want. Lemon pepper is absolutely amazing. Ive tried buffalo wild wings lemon pepper and it doesn't even come close. I always like my wings crispy and being able to add that option online is so convenient. The only part I was a bit disappointed on was the heat level. I'm a huge fan or spicyness but after ordering Louisiana rub and Brazilian citrus pepper I was left wanting more \"heat\". I dont blame them for it though just felt like the heat level was a bit misleading but its just my opinion. Overall amazing place with very detailed and friendly staff"}
{"text":"The flavors are dependable, the wing sizes are tiny. Every piece requires you to stick your pinky out when handling because it's so tiny. Good thing I'm cutting back on calories. These are perfect!"}
{"text":"Wingstop is the best place to get good wings. Boneless or bone in it doesn't matter they are great! Good flavors good service good fries good ranch good everything. Did I say good wings? Oh yes I did."}
{"text":"The wings are large (they have Wings, Boneless, and Chicken strips) they have about 6 to 8 different flavors so not much of a selection, A meal is about $8, and I think the worst part about the place is that they take FOREVER to get your food out- yes, the food is made fresh, but if you're on a time crunch I don't recommend eating here. The seating area is small. I like what they do with the fries though, they add a bit of sugar to it so their sweet (regular and seasoned fries available)"}
{"text":"Fries are yummy!! :D I dont know what they do but the way they cook them is very different from your typical fried french fries...

I'm a huge Buffalo Wild Wings fan so I was a little hesitant to try Wing Stop at first. This WS happened to be located inside the Sante Fe Station and for a Sunday night it was busy. If your looking for a variety of flavors, you're not going to find that here. They have about 7 basic flavors and if you get an order of 15 wings, you can only mix and match TWO. Kinda lame. So anyway, I tried the Parmesan and original style hot. The Parmesan was \"good\" and the original tasted like it was tossed in Tabasco sauce and I wasn't very impressed. The quality of chicken is OK, I've definitely had better. I thought it was a bit pricey for the amount they give you and the quality. 

So for now BDubbs is still my fave, but Wings Stop is not a terrible place to stop by when you're hungry and in the mood for wings. I will however give them another shot just to try the other flavors... :)"}
{"text":"FEATHERS ON MY WINGS. Not okay. Not cool. I will never be going back to wing stop. I should have never strayed from Buffalo Wild Wings. I understand you make so many wings so you maybe don't notice but I am paying good money for wings. Not wings with chicken feathers. I would be giving 0 stars on here if it was possible. There's no way this is normal I've checked online."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Not worth the hype from rick Ross . Lol but it was ok. The actual restaurant itself .... employees were nice . The tables were dirty. We literally walked to everyone until we found a table that was decent enough to eat off of .  We did have to wait a while for our food to come even though it was like 3 other people in the place. I just assumed they had a lot of Togo orders because people kept walking in to pick them up. The mango habanero was really good and the parmesan .We actually tried all the flavors .. the mild was to salty for us and we asked for no salt on fries but they put it on their any way. And then they put a lot of salt on them . We didn't even eat them . And they do advertise to order online because it's seems faster  . Overall I probably wouldn't drive 20 minute to eat here again for some wings unless I was in the area."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of chicken like most Americans. Wing stop is one of those places you frequent because it is open at midnight, you don't want to turn on your oven, and you may have had just one too many. The wings are known for their seasoning which I find extremely salty. They can be pricey too with wings and fries running you about $6-8. And these are not big wings. It also takes a while to make them for some reason. I figured the small amount of meat on the bone would mean a shorter cooking time but maybe I'm wrong. Personally I prefer BWW for my cheap wings. I only come here when my niece wants something."}
{"text":"2700 W Baseline Rd is the address. Yelp says it's on Baseline and Price but there is no store there. I would give a higher rating but I shouldn't have to do research to actually find the place. It's quite literally on the other side of town."}
{"text":"Still no contact from Nina after I emailed her. I suspect it was just a cheap attempt to look more competent"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this. I'm so sad to have been so disappointed. My first time here and the boneless wings are chewy as can be, which I'm praying is because they were frozen and not undercooked, we'll find out tomorrow... the blue cheese is tasteless, and the fries are oddly sweet? I was really hoping to have found a great wing spot, but all I found this evening was disappointment"}
{"text":"The wings are so good here, I had the lemon pepper and the garlic Parmesan. The wings had the perfect crunch to sauce ratio with plenty of meat. I think I found my new lunch spot for work."}
{"text":"They served my soda from an old 2-liter bottle then ignored me when I protested. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Called in an order over the phone for pick-up. The employee advised that my order would be ready in 15 minutes. I showed up about 10 minutes later, paid, and waited an additional 20 minutes. A total of 15 minutes extra than what I was advised. Food is ok, not great."}
{"text":"I used to love you wing stop. You were my favorite. I love your sauces and your fries, but I've gotten you three times recently hoping each time will be be different, but no more. I can't take the undercooked chicken and soggy fries anymore. The first time I just got stomach cramps, but the last two times, I've had food poisoning. Very very disappointed. I won't be ordering from you again. :/"}
{"text":"A bit crowded but definitely worth it to wait. Or better yet do a take out order. Friendly staff and amazing chicken wings!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner last night. I did not realize this is a new location! My boyfriend and I ordered the 15 boneless wing combo with large, unseasoned fries, two iced teas, and added a yeast roll. For our sauces we asked for lemon pepper, BBQ, and teriyaki. She said they could only do two sauces. At the location at 75th Ave they always let us do three sauces. It just makes sense! 5-5-5. If you can order five wings with one sauce, couldn't you just order three sets of five wings and get three sauces? What's the difference? So that annoyed me. We eliminated the BBQ and settled on the other two.
The place was a lot bigger than the one on 75th. It wasn't busy when we got there, but it got busier as time went on. Didn't take too long to get our food. It was hot and fresh! The fries were great with a little salt. Rather than one large order, she brought us a regular order and told us more were coming. The lemon pepper flavor is always delicious. I forgot to count if we actually got 15 wings, but I think we may have been shorted a couple in lieu of some larger wings. The food was really good though. My tea was a little strong and needed some more ice, but my refill was better.
Everything was good until a really smelly customer came in just as we were finishing. Time to go!"}
{"text":"Placed an online order for the 8 pc crispy tenders meal for 2 (lemon pepper and teriyaki) and a side of cheese sauce for the fries. Drove to Wingstop and paid with a gift card. The food was ready except for the fries, which just took a couple more minutes and they were hot, fresh, and delicious. It was a busy Friday night so the only seating available was at the counter, which was fine. My friend & I LOVE the lemon pepper tenders! So good. The fries were good dipped in the cheese but made me full more quickly. I took some leftovers for another day."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, though somewhat overpriced for what you get. Prices are on par with BWW, and food is about the same quality, but with BWW you get a much better experience--Wingstop is kind of like a fast food restaurant inside. If there's a BWW near you, you're definitely going there, but you can be happy going to Wingstop if there isn't a BWW nearby."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS ! as much as I love Wing Stop this location is terrible. We were passing by and I love far from this location I just happened to be on that side of town and I got the wrong order and I called to tell them and they told me to hold on to them until the next time I came around that location and return them to get a refund or my food remade hahahaha what ?! Idk when is the next time I will be on that side of town well now i know I HAVE TO CHECK MY ORDER REGARDLESS OF WHERE I GO BC I HAD NEVER GOTTEN A WRONG ORDER AT WING STOP BEFORE THERE IS A FIRST TOME FOR EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"This is the only place with a reasonable price for wings and fries. I come here often sometimes for take out and dine in. I've interacted with Mel who works the counter multiple times and he's been nothing but pleasant and provides great service!"}
{"text":"Ordered online, and everything was ready at the time promised. The gentleman behind the counter- Miguel- was kind, prompt, and courteous to us, and everyone else he was helping. Wings and fries are hot, fresh, and delicious! We got our order to go, but the restaurant appeared clean. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Uninspired, dull, bland chicken. The \"atomic\" sauce wasn't hot at all. Then my bowels thanked me by bleeding for the next 2 days.

The sauces generally taste of chemicals; the wings are overpriced, and the \"boneless wings\" aren't wings at all, but merely bits of chicken breast, breaded and deep fried.

Also, I saw \"Alice R.\" on a plaque on the wall with a license of some sort in it, meaning that an employee of this company is posting a review of their own company, and is dumb enough to use their own name. Wow."}
{"text":"Wing stop is a great wings fix. They are quick about their orders and the menu is simple. I always get the boneless wings in the original Louisiana rub. Wings always come out crispy and flavorful. The portions and size of the wings are exception and I could not complain. They are like a fast good restaurant for wings and it's great. I recommend you try it if you want a wing fix that's quick and delicious."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I decided to have wings after the USA soccer game. Once we all finished ordering since there was no one in the restaurant, my friend asked to change the channel to a soccer game that was showing on the little screen. The cashier looked at him and rolled her eyes. As we were getting our food, another employee comes out and tells us to keep it down. ** first and last time here."}
{"text":"Waited almost an hour for a 12 piece , saw several larger groups with bigger orders that had ordered WAY AFTER ME get theirs before me. Never eating there again"}
{"text":"When it comes to you I'm very very picky my boyfriend and I have been here a few times. He always gets their traditional lands but she says they are perfectly crispy in flavored. I always get their boneless. I decided to try a different flavors so I got their spicy Korean which was very very good I would highly recommend it above any of their other wing flavors that I have tried. I also got there Cajun combined with the Louisiana rub which is a perfect combination of spicy especially when you dip it with their honey mustard. The only negative thing I have to say was they messed up my order and then they gave me one of the Boneless Wings actually a few of them that had some dry rub. They didn't taste bad by any means it just wasn't what I ordered and I was already home so and 12 minute drive to go back to get it fixed"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is with this location but 60% of the time they get my order wrong. I went with the number 12 wing combo with garlic parmesan fries. I wanted three diffrent flavors but they only allowed two for 12 wings. No other wing place has ever told me that. But okeay no biggie.

 I had very Pacific order  5-garlic parm all drums and 7- Louisiana rub three of them drums and the last four the wing part

I waited about 20min. When I got my food I open the bag to steal a quick french fry. Smh there was no garlic parm on them. I brought the Fry's back to the counter and the gentleman remade them for me took about 6 minutes or so. 

When I got home and opened up my wings they were not how I ordered them. They were 6 of each flavor and only three of the garlic parm were drums and only one of the rubs were the wings. 

My whole order was mixed matched because the girl at the cash register didn't know what she was doing. even while taking my order one of her fellow co-workers had to come up and help her.  its not that complicated.. With alt wings opening up in mesa Down the road I will not be back."}
{"text":"Still solid 5 star after all this time I've been coming here.  Even with all the new Wingstops opening all over town, this is still my favorite.  The girl at the counter even recognized me even though it's been a while since I've been here."}
{"text":"Pretty good bone in wings. They were cooked well with a nice crispy skin. Sauce was in the bland side. Boneless Chicken was good. No complaints about the food. Service was not great, the crew is still very new. Watch out for the add-on items. They charge for a side of celery, ranch sauce, and anything else they can think of. Good addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love me some bonless or bone in hot with them damn sugar frys and cheese for dipping, can't forget a Bacardi mojito on the side! 

Not my favorite location but meh, it'll do!"}
{"text":"Lunch break! Order in my wings and it's a drive across the plaza and vuala! My wings are done! 

Boneless HOT wings with a side of ranch. Sometimes I'll add frys with cheese for dipping."}
{"text":"Great spot for wings. The mango habanero sauce is a winner. Also, make sure to get the Parmesan fries. Add some blue cheese for dipping and you have some great wings along with a very clean, well serviced restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is always slow from calling in order or just seating in being served still slow."}
{"text":"We haven't been to a Wing Stop in ages and actually drove a bit out of our way to visit this one. We were greeted by a super friendly woman who helped us order by making some suggestions. The wings were a little over saucy but good. The fries were delicious and fresh. The place can definitely use a good cleaning. Overall it was good."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of best food bar for sports and conversation. The staff is awesome. Good people and good vibes. I highly recommend this wing stop. A++++"}
{"text":"5 STARS. 5 STARS. 5 STARS. 

I CANNOT stress enough how strongly I feel about this Wingstop location. I have been to Wingstops all over including some in Mexico. This is by far the absolute best! Any time I have guests in town, I make sure to bring them here. I have probably brought 30+ people over the years. Including my brother and his family who have also become regular customers. 

Wingstop is my favorite wing house for sure. I have been going to this particular Wingstop in my hometown for at least 7 years now. 

I have always liked their wings but was never hooked until I tried the boneless garlic parmesan wings as recommended by another patron. Nothing on the menu even compares. I am serious. Just trust me. On this particular visit, they really loaded the wings with the parmesan cheese. The chicken is a cut above the rest. The juicy meat is tender, flavorful, and totally satisfying! The buttery garlic combination is perfectly concocted. 

The fries are a salty sweet sensation that will leave your mouth wanting more. It almost tastes as if there is sugar in the seasoning. With that being said, I always ask for my fries to be extra seasoned. Recently, I have been adding the cheese cup to my order. 

I would like note the friendliness of the owner, Sam and his wife. He is such a hard worker and deserves everything he has gained from his success. He always remembers my order and I have a great customer relationship with him and the brand because of it. 

5 well deserved stars."}
{"text":"Wingstop is my favorite wing house for sure. I have been going to Wingstop in my hometown for at least 7 years now. After moving to Pittsburgh, I was bummed that there were no convenient Wingstop locations.  I was delightfully surprised one day to find the South Side location.

The fries are a salty sweet sensation that will leave your mouth wanting more. It almost tastes as if there is sugar in the seasoning. With that being said, I always ask for my fries to be extra seasoned. I don't usually opt for the cheese in addition to the fries, because the cheese isn't that good and takes away from the amazing seasoned flavor. In my opinion, the fries should either be unseasoned with cheese or seasoned without cheese. 

On this particular visit, I tried the new spicy Korean flavor. To those who have not tried Korean food or to whose who not distinctly know Korean cuisine, this wing may be for you. However, having just come back from Korea, this wing's flavor is a mess. It's sort of just a mash up a Korean flavor with BBQ. There's nothing distinct about it. To call it Korean, well I think is a stretch. Once again, I was disappointed with a menu item that was not my beloved boneless garlic parmesan wings. 

5 stars."}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday night around 11, not too busy. The lady up front was very nice, our food was ready in like 20 minutes! Everything was fresh and tasted delicious! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great location. I often order online prior to pick up. My food is always either just coming up or is waiting for me. I love this streamlined process of check out. I will say the section for drinks could use improvement ( the two sides vary in options and I sometimes find myself visiting both prior to going home). 
Now the food: AMAZEBALLS. If you didn't already know that, stop cheating yourself and get you some! I'm from DC and we often eat Americas Best but I have yet to see one out here so I tried Wing Stop and I must say, IM A BELIEVER! A TRAITOR!! lol they're garlic Parmesan wings are exactly how I imagined they should taste! The lemon pepper R a classic and awesome. And the fries. CRACK! I swear it's not just the seasoning they must use magical potatoes too because It's a very distinct flavor unlike any other and keeps me coming back!!"}
{"text":"Finally a Wingstop in Henderson! We often order from this location as many of us at work love it. The staff is always friendly. They always have our orders correct. Fulver is the GM who turned a horrible experience to an amazing experience. Btw, it was not Wingstop who gave the horrible experience but Doordash and their delivery person."}
{"text":"Greatest wings I have ever tried in my life!! I drive half an hour just to eat these."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying wingstop. I'm not impressed.  My food was extremely salty. The French fries looked very good, but looks can be deceiving.  The fries were very salty and it had a funny sweet taste to it. The sweet aftertaste was just wrong, don't do this to fries. The wings were boneless but I couldn't take another bite. Too much of a sodium taste. I think I had enough sodium in two bites. Now I need water to flush out all this sodium intake. If you like salt this is your stop!"}
{"text":"I would never ever go the Wingstop at 624 Tyvola Road Charlotte, NC.  I put my order for Cajun wings paid my bill and sat waiting for my order.  At the time which was around 1:00 on Wednesday.  There was only two other people in the store at the time.  After that there had to be 20 people that came in and put in there orders.  After 25 minutes everyone had there order but me.  Guess what?  I was the only Non-Minority there and the only one person that did not get served. I left in disgust and now you know what kind of place it is.

{"text":"I like that the food is made to order. 
I don't like that it takes 30 minutes to get 20 wings.  
I like that Jenna was friendly. 
I don't like that she was friendly with her coworkers instead of bagging my order that I could see sitting on the counter. 
I like the new serrano glaze wings. 
I don't like the Hawaiian crap."}
{"text":"We had Boneless Hawaiian, Lemon Pepper and Mild. Yuck!  All three. The best part was the soda machine and the fries. Oh! and the decor.  We are a one and done. Maybe it's someone else's cup of tea. Just not mine. Price not so bad."}
{"text":"Me and my brother want Wingstop for lunch, but this location always smells like raw sewage. Is that fixed or should we not even try?"}
{"text":"After leaving my gym nearby, I had planned on getting a nice healthy meal but couldn't decide where to go. I drove by Ann and Losee and saw this place just opened. I'm not a huge chicken wings fan but for some reason, I can't resist Wing Stop's Garlic Parmesan wings. Goodbye, healthy meal; hello, cheat meal!

I always get Garlic parm wings, hot wings, fries or carrot sticks. They're cooked to order. So, your wings are nice, hot and crispy. The quality of food and atmosphere are pretty consistent amongst all Wing Stop locations. But on the day I went here, the staff was friendly and super energetic.

I'm also not a huge soda fan but they have a soda dispenser with a lot of different Coke products and flavors: Coke, Cherry Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Coke, Sprite, Sprite Zero, Cherry Sprite, Cherry Sprite Zero, Strawberry Sprite, etc. They have brewed tea as well."}
{"text":"FINALLY!! Wing stop in hendo!  .  Best wings hands down.  Been waiting years for this place to open up in henderson and the wait is now over and it definitely did not disappoint.   Very clean and fast service.  Everyone was very nice and knowledgeable.   *one note.  Noticed no trash cans anywhere in the restaurant to throw anything away?   Granted they come to your table and throw your trash.   

Wings were on point.  Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.   The new Korean BBQ sauce is so good.   We also got the traditional hot, mango habanero and garlic parm.  All very good.  And he fries."}
{"text":"Tried Wingstop for the first time a few weeks ago. We placed a to go order consisting of the mango haberno, smoked bbq, and original hot bone in wings. I think the price was around $20. The staff was friendly and helpful and the restaurant was comfortable and very clean. For a restaurant that specializes in wings I was not impressed. The wings were ok, but nothing exciting. I prefer many other restaurants that don't even specialize in wings. Also, expensive to even get a side of ranch, so I made my own at home. I don't think I would return unless they had wing specials."}
{"text":"This is where you go when you really want wings but every other restaurant is closed and chickens have disappeared and it's illegal to make your own buffalo sauce. 

30 minute wait when there were two other people in the restaurant. Seriously, go to Chilis."}
{"text":"My main reason to come here was to try the garlic parmesan. I prefer boneless over bone in & their's are double the size of Buffalo Wild Wings (huge plus!). Chicken was really good; juicy and flavorful. However, my 18 minute wait turned into a 40 minute wait because they lost my ticket."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this place because I've order here before and many times they screwed up my order. Today I gave them the benefit of the doubt and once again they let me down. I did a online order and requested all bone in wings with particular instructions. Well when I got my ordered delivered I received \"salty\" greasy boneless wings with the wrong sauces and decent fries. I also got the smallest dried out pieces of chicken and it was mostly breading. I don't recommend this place to anyone and if you do decide to give it try... Make sure that your order is correct and have 911 on speed dial because you may pass out with high blood pressure with all the salt they use. Not even kidding. I'll stick to Zipps for wings because there prices are way better and the quality of the food is awesome."}
{"text":"They were completely out of forks, they had no hot sauce.... a wing joint... The wings seemed a little undercooked as well"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We love the staff here they are super friendly and always make sure that we are well taken care of. We are here about 3 times a week. Morgan, Lupe and Paula are always super attentive with us. The wings are the definitely our favorite never go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I really like this place....I've never had the wings but I've had the seasoned fries many times, i get the large size and they are SUPER GOOD, always hot out of the fryer and when they say large size, they mean it! .  Place looks clean, they always seem nice and friendly. Yes, it's in North LV which might not be the \"best\" part of town, but it doesn't look bad around there, just a typical busy strip mall type of area.  Traffic can be heavy on Craig, so getting in and out of the lot can be a bit busy, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Alberto is really friendly and really enjoy his customer service. It is like he's always there when I go! He's funny to talk to as well."}
{"text":"The best fries!  They add a little sugar to it, and it is surprisingly addictive!  They have a good variety of wings flavors to choose from, including not so common ones like garlic parmesean, lemon pepper, and hawaiian.  Personally, I just stick to the original hot or mild."}
{"text":"The service and quality was missing all together. I have eaten at this chain all over and this was by far the worst. My order was wrong twice and when I got my food it was cold. Smh."}
{"text":"I've come to this location a few times and I enjoy the order online for pick up option to skip the wait. Well today my order was supposed to be ready at 10:53 and here I am at 11 and they barely threw the wings in the deep fryer. We got our order by 11:04 when there was absolutely nobody in the restaurant. This has happened on more than one occasion to the store. The service is what earned the low score otherwise the foods spot on and continue only because of the quality of wings."}
{"text":"Not a fan of wingstop. Been to this location twice, and had it catered to my work from here once. Keep thinking just the wrong kinds or flavors  are being ordered, but none of the wings are edible. Always too much garlic, too thin of sauce, too greasy, unevenly coated wings, I must have the worst luck because I keep getting recommendations for this place, but they just aren't for me."}
{"text":"This place has some really good wings.  

This location opened up a little while back but we have been there many times since then.  I prefer bone-in wings and they are really good here.  The boneless option is also really good (my girlfriend prefers these).  They have some great flavors that span the spectrum of mild to hot.  The garlic parmesan flavor is good as is the teriyaki and BBQ.  They have a variety of combos and deals so you can take care of however many people you are ordering for.

If you are craving wings and are in the area, definitely stop in here."}
{"text":"Usually the service in here is \"okay\" but Gabriella just helped me tremendously. My kids were sleeping in the car, so she ran our orders out to us and even filled up all our drinks. Went above and beyond to help me. Great customer service, thank you!!"}
{"text":"The food was good like always but there was two younger kids that was working the register last night and they were really loud plus the girl kept cussing and I found that really disgusting tbh. This is not your house."}
{"text":"I ordered online from this store. I was promptly sent a confirmation message telling me that my order would be ready for pickup in 20 minutes. An hour later I finally received my order. When I asked to speak to the manager, only to alert her to the fact that there may be a problem with their online ordering system, she proceeded to talk down to me with a very rude attitude and attempt to explain that my order wasn't received in the store until a whole 30 minutes after I received confirmation. Being in the chain restaurant business myself I knew this was a complete lie but allowed her to belittle my intelligence and eventually offer me a refund. Why would I get a refund on food that I waited an hour for? Also how is it that your website can send me a confirmation right away but not send the order to the store until 30 minutes later. I know this was a lie because when ordering previously my food was ready when I walked in at the suggested 20 minutes. 
I also noticed that the cashier handled food and money without scrubbing his hands, which is a definite health code violation. The manager also attempted to handle my food without washing her hands. If you want to roll the dice on your health, eat here. If attempting to order online you may want allow 50 minutes instead of the stated 20. Definitely amateur hour over there."}
{"text":"I've been to several locations and the one close to me is at 40th st and thomas.  I like that they r open till midnight.  I think that they're wings are very good.  Beer is cheap.  I didn't care for a flavor they no longer have.  It was a special flavor for a limited time.  I forgot the name of it but it had lime and a hot spice to it.... I have yet to try the Louisiana rub.  That's next.  And I've been reading that the fries are a hit or miss, I personally like the fries, I do like that different flavor it has, its unique.."}
{"text":"Wont order from this location again. I will update with wether or not it was worth the fucking hassle of me having to drive as opposed to getting the delivery that i actually wanted. My husband ordered but made the mistake of pick up. Usually establishments that like to make money will go above and beyond for the customer that puts the money in their paychecks. That wasn't the case, the supervisor that talked with my husband is a dumbass and shouldnt work customer service. You never should tell a customer no, not for a simple and easy as shit request. Will call and talk to manager tomorrow and their headquarters."}
{"text":"Wingstop is soo good & Josie was a great help and suggested a good choice of wings ! Coming back soon ."}
{"text":"If you like your wings served in soup and your fries to taste like sweaty sugary balls you'll enjoy your food at wingstop. I've never had my order delivered but read the other reviews, it seems to be a nightmare. I would never choose wingstop over any other stop for wings in town. Your personal tastes may very but based on my repeated poor experiences here and everyone else's delivery reviews, I give this place two stars. 

I'd give them one but to earn a one star from me you have to have really gone out of your way to be terrible, at least wingstop is attempting to deliver a unique food experience. I've never fallen ill after eating there, and they have never stabbed me or anyone else that I've known."}
{"text":"Plus, Plus, Plus

I wanted wings for lunch so thought I'd try this.  Bone in wings = extra (compared to boneless), celery = extra, blue cheese or ranch = extra.   Wings themselves were a bit oily, but the flavor and size were good. I'd go back if someone offered to pay, but for me it's too much money for what you get.  $18 for 15 wings with celery and Blue Cheese.  Ouch.  
My other issue was the timing.  I placed my order and was told it would be 17 minutes. To their credit, they delivered on time, but that ticket time is way too long for a place that basically sells one thing."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that the wings dressed in Lemmon pepper are a amazing!  If you like all flats or drumets all you have to do is ask and they will give you what you want!"}
{"text":"$1 beer was nice, but wing was  hard as rock, I asked if this was harder than usual but they said that was the one I should enjoy...  not for me."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Wingstop I've been to. I called ahead and placed a pick up order. When I got home I realized that only half of my order was right. I immediately called to let them know about the mistake. I would've thought that I would show up, give them back the incorrect half of the order and get the right flavor and be on my way. That's not how it went down. The idiot behind the counter tried to tell me that I had to go back home and get the other half of the order that was correct. That's insane. You guys messed up, not me. I asked to speak with the manager and the girl kind of walked around aimlessly. Before you come up with an idiotic solution, consult with your manager. That's what they're paid for. You lost my business."}
{"text":"I've been going here for lunch several times over the past month and the best thing about it is the reasonable lunch special (4 bone in/boneless wings, fries and a drink) for $5.99. You can't beat that for made to order wings and fries. You get a big portion of fries too. The sauces are a kind of hit or miss, I like the hickory smokes bbq or mild.The overall location is a little dirty though, tables are sticky. The bathroom had no paper towels and the soap dispenser was out of soap (kind of gross before you dig into your food!). Overall, not bad for cheap lunch but not the best experience."}
{"text":"It was my first time going and I ordered online. Got there to pick up and food and it was ready which is great! Then I get home I was expecting fresh warm bread, fries, and wings. Sadly I was wrong. The bread was hard and cold.. Only one of the six was freshly made. The fries were decent but closer to cold. The wings were the only things that were good. I doubt I'll be going ther"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times, not even giving it a chance until a drunkard raved so much about it I had to try it out. The size of the individual wings are very substantial indeed, but the taste and texture is what captivated me. The lemon pepper wings have a lofty balance of salty and crispy while still offering flavor. The teriyaki wings were quite tasty too, but the lemon pepper was by far the star performer. It takes about 10 minutes to cook once you place your order, so don't go if you're in a rush. They also have a nice garlicky ranch dipping sauce that's worth trying as well."}
{"text":"Only reason y I gave this place 2 stars I love there wings but the fact there was a hair in my French fry really wtf gross"}
{"text":"The wings were expected to be good and it didn't disappoint! The customer service was awesome, positive, happy to be there, etc. They look like they have fun working there's food with each other. I order the 12 piece combo and large veggies (but it has an option for fries). Later, I kinda regretted not getting the fries. I was talking to a staff member, Manny, in general conversation and joking. I went about my business. Later, the same staff, Manny, bought a basket of fries to my table. How sweet!!! And no, I didn't ask or told him about regretting not getting the fries. I guess he must've heard me talking to my BF. The only concern I have is the bathroom was a little dirty. I only went to wash my hands, but I could see they're missing toilet seat covers, papers on the ground, and both toilets not flushed (which I know it's not their fault). But they should check the bathroom more. Also, the dining area had dirty tables, but I get it, they were consistently busy. Maybe they should manage staff time better or get more good staff. Last thing, it was freezing in there! During the day, I could see that being a benefit though. Overall, I gave it a four star for food and customer service."}
{"text":"The chicken here was good. Better than other wing stops iv been to.  It was crispy and moist. The fries were mediocre at best. Not crispy and under seasoned. Took 20 min for the food to come which is average for a fried chicken place. Overall I would come back here for the fried chicken but that's about it. Parking isn't too bad but it does get busy as its in a plaza with seafood city. Prices were average for this type of place"}
{"text":"Love the food! Excellent wings and their French fries are amazing with ranch :) 

One of my son'a favorite places to eat :)"}
{"text":"Overall one of the best wing spots in the area. I like my meals extra well done :) price is on the high end but it's clean and they are friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Wing stop is delicious! The chicken is always cooked perfectly and super crispy. This wing stop in particular is very stingy with their wing sauces though. A lot of the time there just isn't enough sauce making the chicken some what bland depending what flavor. The French fries are seasoned very good, yet are disgusting due to the lack of crisp or crunch. They are extremely soggy and mushy. Even when asked to make them extra crispy they fail and are just as soft. I go to this location a lot because it's the closet to me, I haven't had such issues at other locations. The customer service here is alright, nothing great. The employees look very sad or like they don't want to be there. And there are often little mistakes such as forgetting the drinks, side sauces, incorrect change back, and wrong type of wings (boneless or bone in). Overall wing stop is great with their chicken, just this location makes me second guess since all the aspects besides the chicken are poor."}
{"text":"Ordered online through the mobile app. I'm not really why there's so many negative reviews. Wings were on point with flavor and texture, and my order was ready as the time stated. Great place for quick wings, would return to this location again if I were not from out of town."}
{"text":"Love them, everything is made fresh to order, so it takes about 16 minutes, but its worth the wait.  They come out piping hot, I don't like wings that have a big batter on them, these do not.  My husband and I will get a big order and choose three flavors, my favorites are the cajun, lemon pepper and parmesan.  

The place is small inside with a limited amount of tables.  I  noticed that the phone orders and 'to go' orders are a big part of their business.  We usually eat in and sometimes find only a little table stuck against the wall.  But the sodas unlimited and it's consistent quality wings each time we come in."}
{"text":"Dad's dinner secret.
 
Avoided this for years because I thought it was Pizza Hut's wings but 6 months ago we check it out and it's a winner.

My kids love the teriyaki wings but my favorite are the Hawaiian WIngs. The fries are great and a Dos XX while I wait for takeout is always a good thing :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Wingstop is the best place for fast wings. They never disappoint! My wings are cooked to perfection and I never have any problems(: today I ordered a 6 piece lemon pepper!! Yum, the best!! Thank you for having a location so close to home"}
{"text":"Stars are just because I love Wingstop's wings! Customer service at this location is horrible!! I always place an order online and nine times out of 10 it's incorrect. Tried the order ahead online today instead of right away and they ended up making the order at 4:30 when I placed the order instead of paying attention to the time that I needed to be ready by 6:00. Cook lied and saidit was only ready as of five minutes before six but wings and fries were completely cold as if they had been sitting there for the hour and a half. I asked if the food could be remade as I didn't want to feed cold chicken to my kiddos and he he said yeah I'll just remake the fries, not the wings! Lady at the front was nice and said, sorry yes the order has been sitting there for a while. With so many mistakes from this one I recommend taking the extra drive to 48th and baseline and using them.

Update* customer service at Wingstop is great! They were quick to make sure our next experience was a good one and it was. Have been back a few times and cannot complain. Thank you."}
{"text":"The ordering process for the delivery option isn't very easy and I had the person on the phone not being very helpful. Was on hold a few times for whatever reason."}
{"text":"I came in around lunchtime on a Tuesday. I was greeted by what seemed like every person who works at Wing Stop, which made me smile. 

Nancy was my cashier and she handled my order really well and went above and beyond what I would expect from a cashier at a counter place. She made me feel welcome and handled a few special requests I had with my order with no problem. 

Frankly, I knew I would come back to this place before I even had my wings because I appreciated the level of attention paid by each member of the staff to the customer experience. 

Even so, my wings were delish. I got ten garlic Parmesan and if you get the full meal - 10 wings, a soda and a side with two huge sauces - there is excellent value for money. 

IRecommend this place for wings for sure."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the staff was unprofessional and messed up the order! How come I ordered before a rush of 8 people came and all of them get their food before me? The staff all stood around the register area laughing and talking story. Couldn't even tell who was the manager. Ordered 3 meals and they combined them in one box. Knock Knock Hello?? Pay attention people!"}
{"text":"Yuck!

This place is GARBAGE.

You would think that with all the NEGATIVE reviews I would listen.

But nope, I was too hungry to care.

I regret every dollar spent on this place.

I ordered 15  boneless wings, 10 BBQ and 5 with Honey Sauce.

It was dry, dehydrated pieces of turds with a lackluster sauce thrown over the wings in a cheap attempt to masquerade the low quality of the wings.

The fries that I ordered along side the \"wings\" were standard at best.

The only plus side to the fries was the seasoning, which consists of sugar instead of pure salt.

But I could of saved the $15 dollars and just swallowed tablespoons of sugar instead.

0/10 Would not Bang.

Avoid this place.

You've been warned."}
{"text":"This rating covers Wingstop as a whole and has really nothing to with this location.  Wings happen to be a passion of mine and when  I travel I always look for the favorite local spot.  If I can't find something that interests me then Wingstop is my fall to location, that's if they are in the area.  Anyway, I like the fact they have several rubs and that you can order all drums if you want.  On average the wings are a decent size, nothing worse than a sad little wing sitting there in sauce.  The Parmesan Garlic, Lemon Pepper and Louisiana rubs are a few of my favorites but what I really like the most is the potato salad.  Beats any store bought deli brand hands down and comes off with a simple homemade taste.  The fries also are good and can last a second day without a lose of flavor.  As for this location it can be hit or miss but I'm not there for the ambience or the service, however they could improve on that."}
{"text":"I just had some wings from here and awesome some great cuts of chicken and the cooked the chicken right crunchy and flavorful. My order was 10 minutes late but that's fine because the place just opened a week ago and all new businesses have hick ups . The reason I say this is the food quality was great blows those other two competitors out the sky . The inside very nice for dine in and clean . I will definitely be back finally a place that don't mess up chicken. Kudos wing stop welcome to the neighborhood. Well it's 9 months later and I have still had a great experience here , I've heard the complaints about the boneless wings I don't like em myself but the bone in are great . Ordered a 40 pack last night with fries and no problems wings were excellent! Kudos"}
{"text":"What a hell did they forget to put the wings know why the hell did they forget to put the sauce on the wings oh my God I was in the hours that I said that I still had my way to still good I will the boldest weeks I was getting the teriyaki wings and no sauce lotto and I've never had wings liked up for this crazy service is amazing not the game matter fact I'm still going to get on my view and go tonight now me real wings Monday to Friday email drop bombs"}
{"text":"Worst experience they lie about changing recipes & bad customer service very bad rude a girl name America was rude not the best wing stop I rate 0 !!!"}
{"text":"Great place for wings. Always have good service and a ton of selections. Prices are very fair even for large parties to split up a among them all. Environment is typical for a sports bar and they have a decent beer selection."}
{"text":"I have lived in Chandler for 3 years and for the first time 2 weeks ago, we decided to try it. We got half of the house recipe wings and half of the hot. The beans were great and the fries too! Only disapointment was the dinner roll, yes the dinner roll. The photos looked nice and fluffy and buttery, ours must have missed the butter and were kinda burnt. Not enough to stop us from going back. I will give the free pass on the bad batch of rolls!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday with a friend.  Tried the boneless Cajun, traditional hot, traditional Louisiana rub, and fries with cheese sauce (I was hungry!).  The traditional hot was the best of the three.  The Cajun was good but didn't have a lot of flavor besides hot!  Wasn't a big fan of the Louisiana rub.  Fries were good and cheese sauce was a good up sell by the guy at the counter.  Good customer service and food was quick.  I'll be going back to Wing Stop!"}
{"text":"We come here pretty often and tonight's service was beyond ridiculous. I ordered ahead online, this place has a specific line for orders so I stood in it. After waiting for 10 minutes and switching lines from preordered to order here, while 2 girls see the line getting backed up and not saying a word,  a guy comes from the back to start taking care of people in the back of the line. After saying no we were all here first, he started taking those of us who came in first. When I tried to give him feedback for at least having the other ladies say \"we'll be right with you,\" he says \"I just got out here.\" In a very defensive way. Yea, I know, I watched you walk out here!! I then say \"yes, I know. This isn't directed at you but overall feedback for this location is communication with the customer.\" He smiled and said \"ok\" no apology, nothing! I will not be coming back to this location as the customer service has steadily declined."}
{"text":"I don't know ... We came in around 9pm. The staff wasn't into it at all. So I know there wasn't any love put into the food. We ordered 50 wings ... Asked for 10 of them to be bone-in and they completely ignored that demand and reversed the other 40 as bone-in and the specific 10 lemon pepper boneless . I'd come back if they cared more . Too many I don't care attitudes here"}
{"text":"I always had good experiences with the location in Tucson but I was just not feeling the grub we picked up from here. Maybe it was the fact they messed up our order? Yes, this could be a big reason but also they lacked in heat (temp) and just didn't really do all that much for my taste buds.

maybe it was a dud pack I ordered??

The positive: the celery and carrot sticks were on point"}
{"text":"Came in to pick up an online order, was towed it'll be about another five minutes, so sat on the bench waited almost 15 minutes, employee finally asked me if if I'm waiting for an order and hand me the bag that's been sitting on the counter for almost 10 minutes.  Poor customer service"}
{"text":"Ok, Chicken Fingers are pretty tasty. Customer Service is TERRIBLE! I called 6/17 to place a order to go and they said please hold. So I waited like an idiot for close to 6 minutes, and decided they don't want to help me, so I went else where. The next day thought it may be better? No, I called and they say please hold. After 2:45 I was done so I called back and asked them if they do TO GO orders? The guy said yes and helped me. With all this being said, they really don't care about their guests. All good with me! Buffalo Wings is just a short drive away! Wish they would have wanted to help me? Its ok, SOMEONE ELSE WILL."}
{"text":"Never been to a wing stop before but I've heard so much about them. Stopped here since it's only down the street from my home one night after work and was not disappointed. Customers we service was fast and friendly. Good is made to order so everything is hot. Boneless wings were fantastic and the fresh cut fries are delicious. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Staff are very welcoming. Ordered through the phone, order was supposed too be ready at 10:55pm. Got there at 10:50pm & order was already ready , food is fresh. Great place too be and eat!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food from Wingstop.  Everything was fresh and the food was tasty.  It took a bit longer to get our food than I thought it would, but this is the trade-off for getting freshly cooked food, so I was good with the wait.  Staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Came here to get a family pack. We bought the 30 piece with Lemon Pepper Parmesan and BBQ extra crispy. They came out perfect wait time was about right for wing stop they are never quick. Staff was friendly I will come back."}
{"text":"Worst ever. I made line and waited a while for an online order I made. For I could know they are only taking cash! Are you kidding me....  Go to another wingstop they offer better service ."}
{"text":"If you are reading this you are obviously having that inner battle with yourself of whether you should have wings for dinner or not. If that is what is happening right now I am going to go out on a limb and assume that it sounds a little something like mine once did. Lets see if I can help to answer any of your questions.

Hmm Wing stop... I wonder if they have good wings?

You bet your wing loving ass they do!

I really like spicy but my significant other doesn't, ugh if they don't have something for her/him this isn't going to work.

Of course they do Dumbo... You just throw down some Cajun or Atomic Wings and let your less spicy less interesting other half toss down some garlic Parmesan or lemon pepper wings.

The question is.... Ranch or Blue Cheese?

Sorry, I never said I would answer all of your questions, I truly despise blue cheese so your on your own here.

Boneless or bone in??

Considering a boneless wing is really not a wing at all I personally stick to the true wings and go for bone in. But for all you, \" Oh i really want wings/Chicken Nuggets\" People out there, I would assume the boneless would do the trick.

Lets just stop playing this 50 Questions game, stop being a sissy and go pick up a 20 count 1/2 Cajun 1/2 Atomic bone in wings and fries. Ready GO!!! You won't be disappointed, make sure you order ahead on the app or online to avoid waiting 20+ minutes for those delicious little wings... Also remember, Red bull doesn't give you wings, Wing Stop does."}
{"text":"What to say about Wing stop this afternoon.... My wings were delicious, I ordered the 10 piece boneless wings, 5 BBQ and 5 Cajun.. I would have ordered the Atomic but I was at work and do not have the luxury of actually sitting and enjoying my lunch without interruption. I absolutely love hot food and I also have a slight addiction to chicken wings that are done right. So an order of the atomic wings hit the spot when the time is right.

Anyways, the wings that I ordered today with a side of veggie sticks were made perfectly, Just the right amount of sauce, the perfect amount of Cajun seasoning on top of the Cajun wings and they were all perfectly cooked. 

I know this is a chain and I do review chains but I do not normally have raving reviews for the chain restaurants that only consist of deep fryers and sauce vats but I do have to say that the boneless wings at this place are great for a quick inexpensive lunch.  Try it out and tell for yourself."}
{"text":"I was very dissapointed with this place for the 2nd time. The first time my order was wrong, then they fixed it; however, the wings were not seasoned at all. They were dry. Some were also way over cooked and a few others were under cooked. I went the 2nd time to give them another chance and showed up 10 minutes before closing and was refused service. They told me in a rude way that they were closed when they actually closed at midnight. They refused my service very dissapointed. They were still open taking other people's orders but refused mine. I will never again go back. The staff was really rude and disrespectful. I'm a chef at a restaurant and know how it works. They were still open for another 10 minutes. But yet they wanted to leave early while taking other people's orders. Either it was racial discrimination or just playing bad customer service. Never again. They stared me down since the moment I walked in and started with side talk made me feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I love chicken wings! Therefore I love this place! My favorite flavors are the original hot, garlic parmesan and lemon pepper, with the bone in of course! Chicken wings are NOT boneless  sauces don't come with , you have to pay extra...this is not fast food!  sauces not free! hehe and it does takes about 12minutes after you order because it's fried to order. once in a lucky while, they will miscount and you get an extra wing! maybe making up for the size of wings? sometimes they are smaller than usual.

It's great to have this location so close except for the fact that it's in the casino and you have to park and walk to it. So ordering from home takeout can be a little humbug but if your craving for the wings you do what you have to do! sometimes after we watch a movie we have a craving we will order out. or we eat before going to the movies. 

It's nice when my sister and brother used to stay here, because they also loved these wings and would bring them over for dinner. now they stay at Red Rock where there isn't a wingstop. but then again, they also opened up in Hawaii now, so it's not as special to them."}
{"text":"Our experience, my girlfriend and I, here was amazing!!! Angela, the night shift manager was over the top. She made multiple rounds even thought they were extremely busy and managed to pick up after guests and still cranks those wings out in record timing!!!
There was never any less than 15 guests, and for a smaller location having Angela and her staff work as productive as they were was awesome!! 

In short, COME HERE if you're In the neighborhood and say what's up to Angela and her staff!! And grab some wings while you're at it, they'll take care of you!"}
{"text":"This is the worst location that I have been to. The wings are always dry so we have to drive to the location in the Santa Fe Casino to get decent wings and the wait is too long."}
{"text":"If the wait is  going to be an hour do not tell customers it's going to be 15 minutes. The cashier was super rude was acting strange like he was high"}
{"text":"I tried Wingstop the other day for lunch.  I like that they prepare the wings when you get there so they are fresh, but I wasn't really impressed with the sauces I chose.  Hawaiian was gluey and too sweet, and the parmesean cheese was like a bottle of Kraft sprinkled on it.  I wish I had tried the habenero, but the guy at the counter seemed to discourage me.  
I'd like to go back and give them another try with some different sauces.  Service was good, so I'll give it another shot sometime!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their garlic parmesan wings. Also the ranch dressing is amazing. The staff is friendly and helpful. Everything is made to order so it helps to order ahead and save the 16 minute wait."}
{"text":"Food was great. Only thing was that it took long to get my food plus i got sick from eating too fast. Other than that it was amazing and the cashier was very friendly"}
{"text":"Stopped in to use a RedCard coupon for a free 3 piece chicken tender basket -- a really good deal considering full price is almost $9! When ordering wings you get the option to choose one of their sauces to cover them or you can stick to plain. Additionally you have a choice of a side -- some options are fries, veggie sticks, baked beans, etc. They also give you a dipping sauce on the side. Anyways! I got plain tenders with veggie sticks and honey mustard dip. We got them to go, and probably waited 10 or so minutes. There weren't many people in the place but they seemed very busy preparing orders for carry out. I think next time we'd do that to save time! The food was good -- the tenders are pretty typical, and what'd you'd expect for a chicken tender. Definitely will be returning to use more of the coupons!"}
{"text":"This Wing Stop is always so friendly and they have great costumer service. The store is very clean. Robert does an awesome job. He is very attentive to costumers needs. Great place to get delicious wings!"}
{"text":"This is hubby and i favorite Friday night guilty pleasure! The wings are delicious as well as the fries! Yummmmie times 1000!"}
{"text":"Went here with a couple friends on Tuesday evening. I had 5 of each Teriyaki and Hawaiian. One friend had 10 louisiana rub and the other had 15 barbecue. The friend with the Louisiana said he never had wingstop before and he liked them. the friend with the bbq always gets them and loves them. i like them as well but i wanted teriyaki. which was okay but not really that great and the hawaiian ones were good tho."}
{"text":"First time eating at Wingstop and i have to say it was great. 

About 6 choices in wing flavors and few options on the sides. 

Tried the family meal that came with 50 wings, sides and drinks, had traditional wings (bone in) to the boneless options, and they all tasted good, the flavors we ordered were Teriyaki, Mild and Parmesan Garlic. 

Endless drink refills. 

Staff was cool, let us change the channel on the TV. to let us watch college football and they did not mind at all. 

Awesome Grub."}
{"text":"Stop by here before closing to pick up some wings to take back to the room.

Staff was cool and had my order ready about 15 mins after paying for my order, regardless if you order online they will toss the wings in the fryer until you pay.

No over the phone orders, have to order either in person or online."}
{"text":"First time having wing stop and I can say that it was worth the wait. It was a little busy for a Sunday ,but the service was speedy. The cashier was quick with taking orders the food however took a little longer. The atmosphere is inviting. They have 2 large screen tvs in their dining area. I tried the teriyaki, lemon pepper, and smoked bbq wings. Whether boneless or with the bone the wings were great. Definitely everything that they  claim it to be. The Lipton sweet tea is Great! Made to perfection ! Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We've been to one other wing stop before and didn't have a great experience. I thought it was just that location so we decided to give it another go. I realized it wasn't the location so much, as it was the wing stop food. To start, the employees were nice and helpful. The girl at the counter was very patient and answered all of our questions. There was one order in front of us and the place was DEAD. It took about 15-20 minutes for our food to come out. Maybe that's part of the ambiance? 

The food is why this review is so bad. Wing stop just doesn't have good food. The wings are nothing to write home about. They are just wings. I tried 4 of the hot wings and 4 of the lemon pepper wings. My girlfriend ordered 8 of the Honey BBQ. The majority of them were drumstick style and didn't have much meat on them. The flavor was dull on the hot and too strong and salty on the lemon pepper. Total bummer. 

We split an order of french fries. Isn't it impossible to mess up fries? They put this weird seasoning on the fries and they DUMP it on. Way too much seasoning. It has to have sugar in it because it tastes sweet. I don't want my fries to be sweet like candy. Gross. It ruined our appetite."}
{"text":"I'd really give it 3.5 stars if I could! I'll be honest and say Wingstop is nothing special, BUT if you're craving wings then this is the place for you. 

I'm a fan of their takeout so I can gorge in the comfort of my own home, usually whilst watching football or some sporting event with my boyfriend. Wings and sports just go together like peanut butter and jelly. 

Also great if you want to get a large order for friends to enjoy with you! My boyfriend and I are kinda in love with the Lemon Pepper wings. We order more of those than any other flavor. I'm not a huge fan of the BBQ wings, but I don't particularly like any BBQ wings, I prefer the Lemon Pepper or the Original. Can never go wrong with original and can always go right with the Lemon Pepper. 

Their online ordering system makes it easy so you can pick it up at your convenience. Want wings? Go here."}
{"text":"I love wingstop. I have always been a fan of wingstop and this is my favorite location. This location is at least 3 times as big as a normal location and I love the service too. My favorite flavor is the cajun. Spicy with good overall flavor."}
{"text":"Love the wings and fries here. There's such a good variety of flavors - my favorites are the garlic parmesan, hot buffalo, smoked bbq and hawaiian. I also really like their ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  It's cheap and better than Buffalo Wild Wings.  If I lived closer to one I'd probably go here again but this is too far out of the way for me to go to.

The fries were fresh and nicely cooked but they tasted a little sweet like they put season salt or paprika or something on it.  I'd a traditionalist with fries and didn't like that, but if you like that sort of thing you'll love it."}
{"text":"Cool spot for students, nice and relaxed spot scene for a local neighborhood. It feels like a good Man Cave."}
{"text":"This is only based on the online ordering for this location.   My work was on this side of town so we decided to order online and pick up.   When we got there everything was ready for us which was great.  When we got back to the office, we noticed that we paid for extra ranch, extra veggies and a extra side of fries, which were all missing.    
We didn't bother to call because most likely they would've told us to come back and I'm not driving back there for a couple of dollars.   

I have them 3 stars because the food tasted just how it's supposed to taste, and I love WingStop, but what I would suggest for other people ... ALWAYS ALWAYS  check your order BEFORE you leave.   
It's sad that we have to, but I guess if you want it done right you gotta do it yourself."}
{"text":"Looking for a \"wing-man?\" Stop by Wingstop !  Ok a little corny line, but honestly hands down ... wingstop is the place to get your wings.   What's not to love?

Wings are always made fresh.
Wings and fries are super crispy.
The ranch is the bomb (my fianc√© makes fun of me because I always want extra ranch because it's soo good) 

My preference are dry rubs, definitely Louisiana rub and as Rick Ross would say \"that lemon pepper\" 

The only negative thing I would say is that I wish wing stop would come to the Southside .. for now I'm willing to drive to this location to get my wing fix !"}
{"text":"This Wing Stop really gets it right.  The wings and tenders are just perfect.  I give credit to the staff.  I have been to other locations in Texas and Illinois, and they were not even close to mastering the ingredients.  The baked beans are interesting, kind of a beer taste to the sauce.  The tenders are crispy but not way too crunchy.  The wings are traditional or boneless.  The rolls are pretty delicious.  Interesting also is the wide selection of IBC products in the cooler, if you like that more than Coke or tea.  Wingstop does have an odd way of using paper towels in place of napkins, that is a company quirk, so pack your own otherwise."}
{"text":"I got three flavors.  The Cajun were horrible.  Never order them.  They taste like they have been dragged through mud.  So much dry rub on them but then wet from sauce, they were inedible.  The other two sauces were average at best.  Add overpriced, not a good fit"}
{"text":"Customer service fails!!! 
We place the order by telephone, order was 12 chicken strips, fries, beans, two blue cheeses, and an order of cheese sauce. After spending the 15-20 minute drive there and back each way (obviously not one in my area) open the sack only to find the sauces missing. What is the meal without the sauce. Called to complain, placed on hold, even spoke up and said I didn't want to be on hold because I had an order problem. On hold anyways. Hung up, called back and again said I had an order problem, the manager, Shawn, Swan or something said that the only thing he would do is give me free sauce the next time I came in... What? No I'm not satisfied by getting free sauce that I have already paid for on my next visit. A bigger attempt at a discount or comp would have been the only way I was going to be satisfied. My meal was not complete. Very disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"It's fine.  The garlic parm here was pretty crappy, but the louisiana rub and the fries were as expected.  Just your typical Wingstop.  Nothing more and nothing less.  Actually had a really good managers special for 2 people.  15 wings, large fry, 2 sauces, veggie sticks, 2 drinks for $19.99... not a bad deal."}
{"text":"Went back twice cuz we didn't order enough wings for our team potluck! Good service, but 20 mins for 50 pieces of wings? Might be a big too long? Good wings though...you can't go wrong. 

-regular hot
-garlic parm
-lemon peppers

All flavors were good."}
{"text":"I love Wingstop but this location is so disappointing. I was so excited when they opened and for some reason keep torturing myself by trying to eat here. First the good: fries are excellent and wing flavors are really good. The bad: not once can they get my to go order correct. It is always the wrong wing count and flavors. It is a good idea to take the time to open your boxes and make sure you have the right order before leaving. This location is not taking the time to make sure the wings are cleaned first. I've had to remove the skin on wings because they still had feathers. I understand that one can get by every now and then but there are too many to give a pass. I will have to reserve my Wingstop fixes for when I am out of town."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers and french fries  was terrible salted and the the server said gave a excused they don't spice any thing... thats the way comes..and was the end of history."}
{"text":"Amazing Louisiana rub chicken wings and fresh cut fries! No breading and you can get veggies. Very affordable for two ppl! Love this place"}
{"text":"As a regular wingstop customer from Texas, I WAS thrilled to find a wingstop.  This was the worst excuse for a wingstop franchise I have ever visited.  Wings tasted old, the Louisiana rub was watered down, yes it is supposed to be a dry rub, the mild sauce was also watered down.  No flavor.  Tried to call but no answer.  Would love to here from the franchise owner. The location is on Baseline by Frys. Threw away $20 at wingstop so I went to Sonic.  Horrible wingstop location!!!"}
{"text":"Bitty Wings with no sauce...highly disapointed. Stick with bw3 for overpriced wings!"}
{"text":"+ good variety of sauces and wing styles
+ Not the best wings in town, but pretty good overall. If you're in the Santa Fe and you're looking for something to eat, this is one of the better options."}
{"text":"I ordered bone in not breaded and got boneless and breaded. Great taste and since I drove all the way home with an incorrect order I ate them anyways. Just make sure you double check your order as I had high hopes"}
{"text":"I love wingstop. I've literally never had a complaint in the many years i've been going to various locations until last night. last night was my first time at this particular location except i actually didn't go. my husband did an online pick up order, but that's beside the point. i had been talking about wingstop allll week (particularly the amazing fries) and finally last night my husband offered to go pick some up for us! he brought home our food and our wings were great, no complaints. BUT I WAS SO SAD ABOUT THESE POOR, SOGGY, FLAVORLESS FRIES. my fries were completely unseasoned. there are many other places i can get good wings, but no place has fries like wingstop. so you could imagine my dismay. anyways, this location is our closest location and it's like 12 miles from us so at this point i don't see us going back. super bummed"}
{"text":"After eating at Buffalo Wild Wings nearly a hundred times, I am a little tired of their wings. I found this place in Madison and decided to give it a try. 

It turned out to be an awful decision. The wings are pretty expensive. $6.99 for 10 regular wings. It would be okay if they were normal size wings. Unfortunately they are not. The wings I had were tiny. I was still hungry after eating ten regular wings. Seriously, where do they buy such small wings in America? The chicken must be starved to death to have those skinny wings and legs. 

I would rather go back to Buffalo Wild Wings. I don't think such an unimpressive restaurant can last long in Madison. Don't waste your time and money there."}
{"text":"Was excited to try their wings until we showed up and the man opens the door and rather rudely tells us that they aren't open for another 20 mins which would make it 11:30 when the door clearly said 11."}
{"text":"Amazing service! I put in an order to go through the phone and on my way there both of my kids fell asleep in the car. So I called them and they politely came outside charged me and brought the food to me! That is GREAT service! The food is amazing ! Best wings"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in awhile so stopped in to get what I used to always get. A 5-strip combo medium. Got it to go and began chowing down after getting home, or so I would've liked to. Every strip I began eating had that gnarly fatty cartilage you unexpectedly chew down on that makes your stomach turn, forcing you to spit it out. Irritatingly disgusting. After the third strip and closer observation you can tell the chicken they're using now is of the lowest possible cheapest quality. Some of the \"strips\" weren't even strips--more like chicken nuggets being held together with strings of battered breading. Really? I threw the rest away in the trash. My dog wouldn't even touch it. BAD SIGN. Besides that, the fries were drenched in grease and soggy. Not cooked PROPERLY either. This place has clearly gone downhill, yet was crowded with folks who I guess will pay for anything. Should've stayed away."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect coming into this place. It's set up like most fast food joints, no server, menu on the wall. Decently clean and a nice cashier, (Terrel was sweet!) He said the food would take 15 minutes which I was actually please to hear know the would cook the food to order instead of giving us actually fast food (I hate fast food). I ordered 20 classic wings with Louisiana Rub and hickory smoked BBQ. There levels of spicy were thrown off a bit. The Rub was supposed to be spicier than the BBQ but it was the other way around. But for cheap wings they were decent.... But only decent."}
{"text":"I cannot express how disappointed I am with this Wingstop location. I normally eat at the one on Baseline because it is next to my work but I was craving it all of a sudden so I went to this location near my house and what a mistake.. ordered 20 traditional wings 14 lemon pepper and 6 garlic parmesan, 1 large seasoned fries, and a sweet tea for my sister and I. Everything is horrendous just horrendous.. 

The garlic parmesan had no garlic taste and was not even tossed. One side had parmesan the other was naked.. the lemon paper tasted really off in ways that cannot be explained. The \"seasoned fries\" was not seasoned at all.. worst part is.. the fucked up on SWEET TEA!?!?? Like how do you even do that? This place is full of degenrates.."}
{"text":"They forgot our order and didn't notice as 10 orders past us and kept us waiting for almost an hour, but they at least gave us a refund and made us the food. I recommend take-out, the place isn't the nicest."}
{"text":"My favorite Wing joint!! All the flavors are great, but Lemon Pepper will always be the winner for me! All flats, get some cheese sauce for the fries !"}
{"text":"Can go wrong eating at this place! I love there nacho cheese  this location isn't as big as the other locations but it's still nice and clean and accommodating"}
{"text":"The wings are always so delicious !! And their new flavor  brazilian citrus pepper is the best !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Employees are lethargic and unwilling to help. Very rude as well. Had an African American gentleman watch the basketball game while listing to vulgar rap music while taking my order. Unbelievable.


Also, I called over 6 times and was unable to get through to an employee. I asked about it, and the employee said the phone put itself on hold. I'm thinking they did it intentionally to have decreased workload. Asked for a discount based on this inconvenience, nope.

I'm speaking to a manager in the morning. These guys need to be fired, they are costing your company $$$$$.


Here is a picture of the employee."}
{"text":"We ordered online through wingstops website. Timing was great we received the food in about 40 mins...however we we opened it up everything was cold the buffalo chicken looked old...$35 later and my family could not stomach to eat the mushy chicken that looked like it had been sitting for hours. Thoroughly disappointed that we had to order somewhere else for dinner and spend more money!"}
{"text":"Food was late, cold and it had no flavor to it. When I called to figure out the situation, the store owner, Sahil, shouted at me and then hung up on me twice without letting me speak. He later called me to hang up on me one more time."}
{"text":"First time there we walked in and were greeted by the owner. Very nice people. She explained the menu And I ordered the mango habanero wings which were the bomb one of the best wings I've ate. Good prices and everything was cooked to order and perfectly done ."}
{"text":"The wings are amazing, I have been to Wingstop twice only because it is a little bit of a drive. They have several different types of wings and are military friendly. They have fifty-cent wings Mon and Tuesday, their wings can come in boneless or bone-in. They also have freshly made ice tea and a selection of coke products for beverages. It is clean and has nice seating for young, old and in between."}
{"text":"I have fallen out of love with Wingstop. I used to be head over heels in love with this place, but now I'm just kind of \"eh\" about it.

Service: The people working at this location is a hit or miss. Sometimes they're super nice to you, and sometimes it's like they've got a couple of chicken bones up their booties. However, 65% of the time that I've been here they have been very nice and accommodating especially since I order A LOT of wings to take home to my family.

Food: Umm, well.. This place used to super amazeballs. It was so amazebally good that I picked this place over BWW. Never again, unfortunately. Their boneless wings are super salty. I wanted to throw 'em away. And their classic wings don't have enough sauce on them and are also a bit too much on the salty side. My favorite sauce however is Hickory smoked BBQ. Those are almost always delicious. 

Overall: Two stars. One star for the service, and an added star for their BBQ-flavored wings."}
{"text":"I know there are a lot of people who don't like wings for chains but I honestly think they have one of the best wings. Love their fries as well. Definitely going to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for a takeout order. Wings were good, fries were undercooked and cold."}
{"text":"The bone-in wings were dry, I won't order those again. Boneless were much better and a decent size."}
{"text":"I messed up my order so bad and they took care of me, Big Time!!! I love Wingstop but now it's on a new level! I'll be back, a lot more."}
{"text":"It was my first time at a wing stop, it was pretty good, (how can you mess up wings?) I'd go again. The only thing that bothered me was that they were having some wing special and my order would have been significantly cheaper if the cashier had done her job and told me about it. That would have been great customer service."}
{"text":"I was extremely displeased with the level of service I received from the attendant that was packaging my order. Not only were my wings overcooked. She forgot to place the sauce with our order.  Then when I had to drive all the way back to the store after taking my order home to eat. I revisited and asked her for the sauces she had forgotten on my order. 

She then proceeded to lie and say that she had placed sauces in our bag. She basically called me a liar in doing so. As if I'd drive back after spending 48.79 just to lie about sauces on my order."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would! First of all I called 3 times to place an order and they just kept putting me on hold
For over 10 minutes each time. Then we get there and it takes 23 minutes for our food to be ready! We only got a 10 piece combo & to top it off they mess up our order!!!!! Ugh never ever coming here again"}
{"text":"Word in the streets is that Wing Stop has the best chicken wings around...I decided to see for myself and here I am a year later, Duchess of Wing Stop.

So I go here a lot. That doesn't mean I think it's perfect (notice the 4/5). But one thing I value most in establishments is consistency. With Wings Stop I know I'll get hot, crispy, flavorful chicken wings because they always make me wait a blasted 18-23 minutes. That's how you know it's fresh. Service is quick and curt. 

The only downside for me is that it's a little pricey but it prevents me from eating it daily and getting high cholesterol I guess.

Favorite aspects are the unsweetened tea, blue cheese dip, seasoned fries, and I always always get lemon pepper. Also team classic wings for life. 

I don't think I ever craved wings so much until I started coming here. Curse you, Wing Stop!"}
{"text":"Wings weren't that good. The soda machine was out of Coke first thing when they opened. Got the order wrong had to wait to get wings. Can't recommend, but place was very clean."}
{"text":"The service was great . Wings are made to order so nothing was sitting around. Food took about 15 min to cook. The wings were fresh and hot. Lots of flava. I would have given more stars if they weren't sitting in a pile of grease."}
{"text":"I called to make a phone order and was put on hold. After 15 minutes, I was hung up on. When I went to the store the MANAGER, Essence, told me that it is their policy to ignore phone customers when the walk in line is busy. She offered no apology for the inconvenience. She simply said that the walk in customers take priority. That would be more acceptable if they had communicated that to me when I called instead of wasting my time."}
{"text":"Working late night shifts must suck I'm sure, people should still treat their customers a little more nicer. These kind of business rely a lot on customer service & being familiar with different wing stops stores this one is by far the worst, our host Jennifer seemed annoyed & all around rude. It's unfortunate that not all locations can go by the same motto that would make this place even a slight okay compare to the rest of the ones I've visited. I'll continue to go to my favorite location & save myself the trouble of even giving this place a dime."}
{"text":"This location is the best! Always the same great experience, everyone is attentive & very on top of things! Angelica was my favorite, you can tell why she was in charge. But overall from service to food is never ever a disappointment! One of my go to places all the time!"}
{"text":"Ordered some wings today. Picked wingstop, thinking it would be quicker than buffalo wild wings. It wasn't. I was already eating lunch 2 hours late, so I was really hungry. I paid for extra sauce because my kid wanted sauce on side, and there was no option for that online. I paid for my food at the time it was supposed to be ready. 10 minutes later, I was told they haven't even dropped my wings yet. People that ordered food after I paid got their food before me, and I ordered online and showed up when they were supposed to be done. For messing up my order, I was not offered any discounts, remember I already paid extra for sauce.... I was offered some nacho cheese for my troubles. Nacho cheese? What the hell do I do with that? I didn't have fries. Maybe they should have given me some fries to put my cheese on. It's been 5 hours, and I still haven't figured out what the hell I was supposed to do with nacho cheese. And they were out of blue cheese dressing to go with the veggies I paid for. What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"The service at this particular location is absolutely horrible. Won't be back!!! They are extremely slow took them almost 40 mins to bring me my food smh horrible service"}
{"text":"I was not impressed....this was my first time at any Wingstop location, and I can't say I'll ever be back.

There was nothing really horrible about it, it just wasn't great. I ordered the 6 boneless wings combo with 1/2 lemon pepper and 1/2 mango habanero. First of all, we were in line FOREVER. There were only 2 people ahead of us, but the service was incredibly slow. My friend ordered first, but for some reason I received my food first - it was really strange.

We were told it would take about 12 minutes for our orders to be ready.....it was closer to 20 and as I mentioned above, my food was ready before hers, even though she ordered a good 5 minutes before me. The kitchen looked to be really disorganized and a lot of employees were socializing instead of working. 

The flavor of the wings wasn't that great either. Overall, it just missed the mark and I am glad that I live so far away that I won't have any desire to drive across town to hit this location."}
{"text":"We are new to Las Vegas.  I was very happy to find this place! The wings are great, so is the service!  Most other places here are in a hurry to get you in and out but not this place.  The prices are good too.  I'll be patronizing again soon."}
{"text":"I placed an online order on 1-22-11 at approximately 8:45PM and was assigned a pick up time of 9:16PM. I arrived at the location and was told that my order had not been started because the employees forgot to check the fax for an online order. There was another customer there who called in her order, arrived 30 minutes after the call and they still had not started preparing her food and she was being ignored as well. It was not busy, when I arrived, the manager was leaning against a broom talking on her cell phone. The employees were just milling around and no food was being prepared. Additionally there were only 3 tables of customers who were all eating, thus no reason why food should be delayed.  

Once I realized it would be another 30 minutes before they could even get to my order I asked for a refund and was refused. I asked 2 additional times for a refund and was refused again by the manager (who is the owner's wife). She did not speak English (per her employees) and because I am African American assumed that I didn't speak Spanish. She proceeded to use racist and derogatory language regarding me and my request to her employees and in ear shot of the restaurant patrons. She referred to me using the slang for whore, fat pig, and the Spanish slang for the N----- word. I continued to request a refund at which time she called the owner Jose Arriola who informed me that I was not getting a refund nor was I getting my food order and even if I called GOD it wouldn't help the situation.

I repeated my request for a refund while repeating back his statements for clarification. While I was speaking Jose ended the call by hanging up in my face. Once he ended the call, I asked the female manager? again for a refund. By this time I have been in the restaurant for over 40 minutes. I was told by an employee that Jose was on his way to speak to me in person and to resolve the matter. Within 5 minutes Jose arrived and started a conversation with a friend of his for an additional 30 minutes. I was told in confidence by one of the employees that he was stalling on purpose in hopes that I would either leave without my money or food, or I would cause a scene which would give him reason to call the police.

I remained calm and continued to ask at 2 minute intervals for a refund. Finally Jose came to the counter and stated that I would get a refund via online and that he cannot and will not issue a refund in person. I requested something in writing that he agrees to process a refund and that the refund would be placed on my credit card by Monday. He provided me with an incomplete sentence on my receipt stating \"Refund order because of ASAP\" with his signature. 

My fear is that he is in fact not going to refund my money and will claim that I received my order. At this point I have filed a complaint with the Arizona AG's office and I am contacting my bank tomorrow (thankfully they are open on Sundays) to begin fraud proceedings. Needless to say I am NEVER eating at another Wingstop anywhere in the world and will encourage others to never eat there again. 

Beware if you go to the Wingstop on Dobson in Mesa, you may not get your food and you DEFINITELY will not get a refund."}
{"text":"First let me say that I love wing stop. This review is for the store. 

I'm Keto so I do not get the combos when I order my wings. I always get 6 piece wings by itself with no problems at every wingstop I go to. The exception to this is this specific wingstop. They said the minimum I would have to get would be 9 wings. I know it's just 3 more wings but it's the principle of it! Why would you lie to to a customer to upsale your wings"}
{"text":"At work, this place is an institution with one of the guys. To the point that every Thursday is now known as WINGSDAY and we MUST go to Wingstop. There is no other option. In fact, the manager (?owner?) doesn't even need to take his order. All he says is \"I'll have my usual,\" and it's done.
Now that's service. It's not extravagant or over done, but it's a solid wings place. Good food, filled with business types and ESPN. It's everything you need to wings, lunch and men! { and a few token chicks }"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced for the quality...

The sauces I tried were flavorful but nothing I can't get at Bdubs for about the same price. The boneless wings were a bit too crunchy for my tastes on the outside and chewy on the inside. Bdubs patrons will find that the boneless wings are nearly identical in texture. Overall the meal was satisfying, but it felt overpriced by about $1.50. The staff was friendly if a bit disorganized."}
{"text":"As you can tell by the two stars rating on Yelp, this is not a great place to order food. I came here after placing an online order at work for a 7 pm pickup on my lunch break. I arrive at Wingstop approx. 07:05 pm and I had to wait in line for about ten mins, because of one register being open. My order of 10 flat wings and fries was yet to be ready even though. I had pre-placed the order at 3 pm. I explained to an employee, who I think was the manager? About my issue but who deflected( with it's not my fault). When I had the chance to eat my bag of food, the food was all soggy and not well prepared( rushed). 

I am disappointed with this restaurant I feel like they could do a lot better for the price. They are in a great location right beside UNCC, so this helps with staying open because the food is not that great for the price."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what all the hype is about. Definitely have had way better wings. I went inside the location and that should have been my first sign because is was rather dirty and it wasn't like they were extremely busy. But I was there so I ordered. I got 5 lemon pepper and 5 hot with fries, it wasn't bad but wouldn't go out my way to go again. The seasoning on the fires was good tho. And service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Completely over priced. I called to order pickup and their standard pricing is $1 per wing... Insanity! There should not be wings in the world more than 50c per... And even that's on the high side."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time tonight. Ordered well done/extra crispy, as that is what I prefer. Wings were perfectly cooked, crispy but not burned. We chose Atomic, Hawaiian, and Mango Habanero sauces. Would not do the Atomic again, all heat and not good flavor (have had much more flavorful \"Atomic\" type sauces). Mango Habanero was very good. The star of the show was the Hawaiian, an Asian ginger sauce. Very large orders of celery (much more than BW3). Blue cheese dressing was excellent, very flavorful, and large cups. Will definitely order from them again, just wish they also had a Caribbean Jerk flavor sauce."}
{"text":"Wings and a few sides just isn't enough variety for my taste. The flavors for the wings were ok but the seasoned ones (lemon pepper and Cajun and LA rub) were too salty. The people and service were good though."}
{"text":"I have such a love/hate relationship with this place.  I go here about once a month and I think I'll just start writing about each experience so you'll see what I mean. This place needs to clean house and get a new manager.  

May 5, 2016 - I'm about to leave work so I call to place a to-go order.  They keep me on hold for 13 minutes.  I was able to download the app, order, pay, and they still never came back to the line so I hung up.  When I get there 30 minutes later, my order is not ready yet and they are out of ranch.  I get home and they didn't give me my mozarella sticks.  Four employees were sitting around taking breaks meanwhile I waited 30 minutes past my pick-up time for my order.   

Until next time...to be continued."}
{"text":"Went on Monday 10-5-15 to pick up some wings around 5:50 PM.  I probably eat here once a week.  It's convenient for me to call it in and then it's on my way home so I just stop and pick it up.  This location is on lamb and stewart, in the Smith's shopping center.  It's a pretty sketchy area but it's always crowded in there.  

$13.14 got me 8 bone-in wings (half mild and half garlic parmesean), fries, two warm buttered rolls, a drink, veggie sticks, and ranch dressing.  

Wing stop has my favorite wings because they are crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The worst thing in the world to me is some gummy, fatty, wings.  

On my latest visit I was treated to an old homeless man with no legs staring at me while I waited for my wings.  He puttered outside in his rascal and sat right outside the front door begging everyone who walked in/out of the restaurant.  I'm human and compassionate and all that shit but I don't like to be harassed while I'm tryin' to score some wings.  

My order has never been wrong here.  And the employees are efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would, this was the nastiest chicken I've had in my life I had 5 orders of wings and each order was nasty hard n waay over cooked, it's like they re-fried the chicken! The fries were cold and they were ridiculously high! I've eaten at many wing stops before and this by far was the worse ever! I will not be eating at another wing stop anywhere ever again! The cooks need to learn to fry chicken if they wanna have a career in frying chicken"}
{"text":"Excited for this wingstop to open! Went in on opening night and was not disappointed. Ordered food to go and it was ready in about 10 minutes. Will be returning for sure! A nice new addition to our huntridge neighborhood
They are open 7 days a week 10:30 am-midnight!"}
{"text":"My husband decided on some wings last night. He came home with some boneless mango habanero and some bone in Louisiana rub. We also got an order of cheesy fries. The wings were great but the fries could've been cooked just a tad bit more. Also, while digging into the fries we noticed a very long strand of hair. Gross! Hair net suggested, especially with that long hair! 

Can't say it'll be our last time there because we are Wingstop fans and this location is close to home!"}
{"text":"CAUTION: This restaurant intentionally gives lackluster service to Caucasian people.

I have been in here i multiple times and on multiple occasions I have been given very poor service which I am attributing to the fact that I am white.  One time I ordered a meal for dine-in and while I was waiting they were bringing out meals to the other (non-white) patrons, when it was time for my meal instead of just bringing it out they decided they would just shout my name out and I could come get it myself.  I have placed Dine-in orders only to have them packed up to go.  I have had requests ignored.  I have had just a general overall attitude from the whole staff of this place.  

I know it can't be easy being black, especially in a city as segregated as Pittsburgh, but taking out your frustration on someone you have never met by using your tiny speck of power as a fry cook is just plain pathetic."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.. Ordered and its 2 hours later- still no food!!! It's not like this in Detroit where I am from; but this is not the service I have come to expect. Go to Zaxbys!!"}
{"text":"Just did a call in order and the staff is more concerned with hanging out with the security guard of the area and gossiping about a female customer. I come here often and usually call in. According to the guy on the phone you can not order 40 wings at once. It has to be 30 or 50. So I had to call and make a second order of just 10. I have been ordering 40 from there for over 3 years. Then when I picked up the order, I asked the girl about it and she only said she was new and didn't know. I asked who did work there longer and she laughed and walked away to gossip with the security guard again."}
{"text":"I love wing-stop favorite place but this location is far by worse. Believe me I know service and there no service at this location. I don't need to write a 2 paragraph on it but you can tell their is no management"}
{"text":"So far this is my go-to wing place in Phoenix.. The lemon pepper wings are the best!! And their blue cheese is so good, you can buy it by the pound. I like to get take out, have not eaten inside yet."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I LOVE Wingstop! 
Seeing the reviews to this one My girlfriend and I almost decided to wait until we got closer to the one we normally go to but we were starving. 
Walking in.. we were greeted right away by both cashiers and my first impression of the place was a good one. It was clean and spacious. 
The cashier got our order right and repeated it to make sure.
So while sitting down waiting for our food I wondered why this place got such bad reviews and so I started to read some.. next thing I know it has been 20 mins later and our food wasn't done!
So I walked up to ask the kid and he had said oh we're putting sauce on the wings now. 
Waiting patiently for another 10mins by then I was already irritated and as I was walking up again the manager approached me. 
Finally we got our food after 30 mins of waiting ! 
The only reason why this place is getting 3 stars because the manager approached me and tried to help also because the kid gave us 3 extra ranches."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for wings! I'm addicted to wing stop,especially their garlic Parmesan and original hot wings with their amazingly tasting seasoned fries. Great customer service and great place to just sit back enjoy great tasting wings with friend or family. They also serve beer. This is a place I'd recommend to everyone! This location is great right next to GameStop and Krispy Kreme doughnuts!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service and time it takes to get your food is ridiculously long.  Every time this happens - not just once in a while but every time I come into this store it is super slow.  Not sure why or what the hold up is but I purposely avoid the store as a result."}
{"text":"wings were extra extra salty,
So we couldn't eat them at all

That's the only thing but salty food is a big turn off so we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I made a stop here to bring some food home to my house on the west side, since I was on that side of town and after having experienced the Mentor-on-the-Lake location many times growing up.  I pre-ordered online with a request that the order be ready 2 hours later.  When I arrived at the restaurant, the order was \"lost\" which took 5 minutes to find the paper, that got tossed on the bottom of some pile.  Additionally, because of this, it took another 30 min for my order to be ready, since they had customers waiting already.  I was not upset about waiting my turn, however I pre-ordered to avoid this delay.

Once my order came in, I double checked the wings and noticed that I was given the wrong 2 sides (beans instead of fries).  The cashier refused to correct this for me, and said I could purchase the fries if I really want them.

I will not be going to this Wingstop location again."}
{"text":"My first Wingstop experience and I find it odd that the fries were the highlight.

The wings were decent - I just felt that they were skinny, skimpy, and lacking flavor.

I like how there's TV's everywhere, the IPA was really good, and the 2 soda machines are convenient for the variety."}
{"text":"This place is friggen awesome!!!!! Since Buffalo Wild Wings wants to be a bunch of gun hating commies I decided to look for an alternate wing shop and I have found it. This place literally has the best wings in town! I love to grill wings but I can't even lie, this place blows my wings (and Buffalo Wild Wings) out of the water. First time we got the fries they were a bit salty so next time we ordered light seasoning and they came out even perfect. The wings are just absolutely amazing, not sure what they do to make them so good but keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good...it takes 17 minutes to get your order done.  Have received wings and/or fries not hot at different times.  The prices have gone up quite a bit with the changes in the menu choices.  Maybe the Santa Fe Casino should lower their rent...they seem to want you to pay more after they take \"most\" of your money!"}
{"text":"The mango habanero wings are freakin awesome. Not impressed with the fries at all. 

The staff are very friendly..."}
{"text":"I always place my order over the phone which takes about 5 minutes. Then I wait 15 minutes to leave the house (very close) just to get there and end up standing in line for another 10 minutes while watching my food wither away on the rack. Then stand in line another 5 minutes to fill my drink at the coca-cola machine that seems to leave everyone indecisive. 

Been here enough times to confidently say the food is inconsistent. I always have to order my food well done here or the wings come out slimy and the fries soggy. Sometimes asking for well done fries gives the perfect lightly crisp crunch and other times it's still soggy. I don't know what it is.. I'll mostly likely still come here since it's closes to my house but there could definitely be a few improvements."}
{"text":"Finally a Wingstop in Henderson!  One of the best places for wings!!  Right next Bestbuy in the Galleria shopping area off of Marks St!!  I remember seeing it a couple weeks ago but it wasn't listed yet on their website or on yelp. Glad I was able to stumble upon it!!  Time for some wings!!"}
{"text":"Never been here before although I've known of it for years. Today my biz partner and I will try the Blazin Wings which are supposed to be hotter than the devil with chlamydia. We will see. I will report soon.

Ok I'm back. The Blazin wings were good but not hot enough for me. The mango habanero was delicious. Desert heat a close 2nd.  I have came, I have conquered. Respect my gangsta."}
{"text":"We place an online order, with the pick up time being 9:15pm. We arrived at 9:10pm, in which we were informed it wasn't ready yet. And that's fine. We waited. And waited. Annnnd waited. It was now 10pm and we finally got our wings. And they forgot the sauces. Imagine getting home after waiting way longer than the pick up time, just to have naked wings. Awesome."}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch last week.  Got a combo of wings and veggies.  I liked they split sauces even with smaller orders.  I had the hot and the cajun.

Wings came out in 6 minutes.  Service was good.  Wings were very good.  Hot, crispy with a nice coating of sauce.  Hot wasn't too hot.  They have hotter flavors if someone wants it.

I had a great experience here and will be back.  Only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is because I had several of the wing parts break.  Other than that it was great.

Next time I'd get the fries with wings and order a side of veggies.  The amount of fries they give on a combo doesn't even compare to the amount of veggies you get in a side."}
{"text":"Dined at this location on 04/11/2018. We ordered one of there specials, which the cashier was very helpful. ordered 6 garlic parm, 6 medium bone in. 6 boneless hawaiian and 6 boneless teriyaki. not a big fan of their boneless. just too much breading. we got our order quit quickly, but one of wingd were wrong. instead of garlic parm, they gave us lemon pepper. big difference!  went back up, told them and said they will bring it to me. the re-fire came no less than 2 mins? really fast. i figure they re-fried the wings, re-tossed and sent it to our table. that is exactly what they did. wings came back oily and tasting like lemon. went to ask if they re-tossed or made fresh wings. they said they made fresh wings. hmmm fresh wings in 2 mins?? i dont think so. told them that it taste alot like lemon, but they insisted they were fresh. so they said, if im willing to wait 18 mins, they would make a fresh batch. why didnt they do that in the first place. with no manager or lead line cook, they will do anythking they want. GOOD THING NO ONE SITTING OUR TABLE IS ALLERGIC TO ANYTHING. man that would be some bad news. FYI we turned in a purse to an employee. hopefully the rightful owner returned for their purse, and everything is in there. 

i will NEVER return to this location and i will make sure anyone i know will not dine there."}
{"text":"Called in our order at 10:45am which was the time the website said it opened. Got to wingstop by 11:00am and our order still wasnt done. Watched people who ordered after us receive their order and when we finally received our order, it was WRONG."}
{"text":"The food was really good! The smart phone app has issues though, when you get the app it has a deal that you will get 5 free boneless...however it doesn't actually work, so that was a bit irritating. Not neccessarily the restaurants fault.

I had traditional wings in Lousiana Rub and Original hot with Bleu Cheese.  The Lousiana Rub ones were my favorite and I'll definitely have to get them again.  The Bourbon Baked Beans are amazing, I love baked beans and these had such a different but yummy taste!"}
{"text":"Food was good, BUT...Eliminate the dishonest and underhanded way that customers are cheated out of extra money. I asked for one order of 20 wings with 3 flavors. The order was purposely entered as 2 orders (10 and 5+5) of wings, which resulted in a higher price charged to me on my receipt.  Though the extra amount (stolen) is small, the dishonest intentions are not. If the menu has 20 wings at a price, and I order 20 wings, I do no want it entered as two orders which costs more, so the employee gets a bonus. To me, it is stealing from customers, because something is done which I did not ask for, and I am charged more for a decision which was not mine. DISGUSTING!!! I brought the difference in price up to the employee for an explanation as to why it was entered differently than how I ordered from the menu. The employee shamefully admitted they get bonuses when they enter orders in that manner.  SHAME!!!"}
{"text":"I order online to this location all of the time. They do a great job of making sure that my order is done at the estimated time, and the food is always tasty. However, the last time I ordered, I was disappointed that I only got two out of three of my ranches that I ordered with the family pack. I drown my fries and chicken in ranch, so I was sad about that. Also, I was maybe 6 minutes late picking up the food, and it wasn't kept as hot as usual. You could tell it had been sitting out of the warmer for a while. Overall, this is my favorite location and I will continue to order from here. I would just appreciate getting everything I paid for and my food still hot when I pick it up."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service!!! Tried to redeem my check in offer and the manager (Victor) was a complete dick! First he said that the coupon needed to be printed when it clearly said to show it to the manager at the bottom of the screen. He then tells me that he can't redeem the coupon because they have the special only on Mondays and Tuesdays. Meanwhile his attitude while explaining this to me did not help at all!"}
{"text":"Great wings and fresh cut fries. Just down the road from our home so easy to get in/out. Do need to work on the app to make easier to order and understand the lay out more. The flavors we have enjoyed are Cajun rub, garlic parmesan, Hawaiian and mango habanero all worth trying."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times, mostly because our son loves this place and whenever we would be with him he suggests wing stop and being inside Santa Fe made it convenient
.
They are ok, but kinda small for the price. He don't seem to mind how much they are. He usually orders 30 hot and 20 medium both with extra sauce and he would also order fries too.
Being in the casino I am sure they are higher priced than if you went to a regular wing stop but I have no idea.
Customer service behind the counter we have always found to be friendly even when getting refills on drinks you have to walk back to the counter and ask for it.
The flavor of the sauce is good, as I said the only negative is the wings are smaller than some places we have been.
We have never had a problem eating here ~ so I would suggest if your coming here and have no problem with the size of the wings go for it!"}
{"text":"Wings were over cooked and hard.. Too hard to chew in some places. Also tasted like they had it out sitting for a while! I called in a phone order, they said 15min; so I went in after 10 mins. They brought my food out from the BACK like it had just got done cooking.. But it was NASTY! I got the 8pc boneless, and I received 7 pcs.. As I paid for my food, I ordered an extra side of fries.. It took another 15 mins to get those fries.. FRIES!!! 15 mins!! Luckily the girls at the register were polite.. Otherwise I would have raised hell in there. I was hungry. I couldn't complain and wait ANOTHER 15-20 mins. These cooks SUCK. The ONE star is due to the cashiers ONLY. The other non existent stars are due to the crappy food."}
{"text":"Awful!!!  Cooked to the point of being petrified!!!  Hard, crunchy, dry, barely edible!!!  So over cooked there wasn't a drop of moisture left in them. They were chicken wing jerky!!!  Maybe you should try baking your wings for those of us that don't like to chew dry particle board for food. Blech!!!!!"}
{"text":"The creepy and lazy manager pulled his cashier off break to help up front so he could continue flirting with 3 ladies for 10 min. Gross and unprofessional.

Other than that, the girl on break who jumped on the register who helped me was very nice and the food was fine like usual. They just forgot my honey mustard."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick dinner and ordered my food over the phone. I specifically asked for EXTRA CRISPY wings. I got home excited for my meal, and what do i get? Soggy wings! Mind you, I live 30 mins away and I was looking forward to my meal. This was disappointing...

The bright side, the manager offered to serve me complimentary wings to make up for the messed up order."}
{"text":"Awesome place great owner great food have gone there every Sunday the browns play for the last 3 years and have never got sick of it it's that good"}
{"text":"The place has an overall great vibe, but the food was below standard. We got mango habanero, atomic and mild. The mango habanero was the only bare able one taste wise. You guys need to update the flavors on your menu, not to mention it was a bit over priced. I might update if they ever decide to update their current menu."}
{"text":"I stopped by wingstop for some wings (first timer btw) and when it was my turn to order I thought, \"I'm not THAT hungry, so I'll just order 8 wings\", and after giving my order I was told there would be a 20 minute wait.  Seemed fair but I was a bit bummed.  I wasn't THAT hungry anyways so maybe after the 20 minutes I would develop more an appetite.  So I waited... but didn't even have to wait the 20 minutes!  I only had to wait an hour and fifteen minutes!  By the time I got the eight wings I wish I would've ordered more!  Thanks Wingstop!"}
{"text":"All I can say is \"boneless\" and \"garlic parmesan\" wings. Their fries are yummy and different as well, they have a delicious ranch dressing that I just want to dip like crazy. Mmmmm juicy fresh made to order wings, they never let me down, have been here multiple times and always a success!


Wingstop you rock!"}
{"text":"I love wing stop but for now on I will be going to the Dobson location because the service here is absolutely horrible! Everyone is so rude and act like they hate their job. I've given them too many try's."}
{"text":"I could literally live off wings for the rest of my life. having said that, I could literally live the rest of my life at wingstop living off of their wings! delicious flavors (lemon pepper and lousiana rub are my fave) and even better prices! love coming here by myself, or sharing dinner with my family!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for lunch during the work week. I always get the boneless strips, cajun or hawaiian. Love that they have the drink machine with over 100 choices. Fries are very good. 5 boneless strips, fries and a drink is $8-9."}
{"text":"Louisiana rub is the best in the bizz!!!! good flavor and the right amount of spice!"}
{"text":"I love Wing Stop!  I was excited to see one so close to our new home in Vegas...SLC doesn't have one.

We tried it out on a Saturday night...so it was hopping.  Their flavors are awesome and the dipping sauces are oh emm goodness!  The ranch is my fav, but the blue cheese is great too!

We tried the boneless this time and I have to say they were a little dry.  Wish there had been more sauce.  Especially on the garlic Parmesan!  There was plenty of Parmesan but hardly any garlic sauce.

We will be back though....I dream of their fries and seasoning!  You know you can ask for extra seasoning on the side, right??!!"}
{"text":"My first time here tonight. Service was good, the guy let me try some sauces and was helpful. The wings were ok, nothing to go out of the way for. They give you a lot of fries  but the food was cheap and they don't put much sauce on. It's on a college campus and it's surprisingly clean."}
{"text":"Best wings in town, in my opinion. I always stick with original hot. Their atomic flavor tastes like some weird peppered beef jerky. That's disappointing to someone like myself who loves spicy food. But overall, I've never had a bad encounter as far as the food or employees go. It's always been a grand experience."}
{"text":"Not awful. But definitely not the best. The flavors are hit or miss. Some are great. Some are best described as very salty honey. The only other complaint I can think of is that there is only one drink machine. The restaurant is in a great location, so it's pretty popular. The last time I was in there, the line for the drinks wrapped around the wall to the doors of the restrooms. It took FOREVER just to fill up my drink. Another machine would be really useful. The customer service is great, the fries are great, everything else is great. Just those two things, and the wing thing specifically is kind of a dealbreaker."}
{"text":"Mediocre wings.  I was really excited after hearing how good wingstop was.  kinda disappointed."}
{"text":"I get lemon pepper wings, like the Big Boss, lol

Counter service, but they'll come around and refill your drinks

I like the fries well done"}
{"text":"I love the food at NYPD. It's some of the best Pizza around in my opinion. Prices are a little higher than most but you get your money's worth.  The staff are very welcoming and out going. Our server Alexis was fantastic! Thank you Alexis!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  I would give zero  stars if I could. Forgot half of our order and then pretended to forget we ordered. And the acted like I was a jerk for reminding them to give me my drinks."}
{"text":"Don't know why Rick Ross came there, because these wings taste like straight garbage. Bet he wished he would have kept on hustlin' that day...he'll never come back. The wings smell and taste bad, I was never like, \"Wow, that smells good, can't wait to get home!\" Nope. Also salty as a pretzel and the salt tastes burnt. At least the BBQ ones are like that. Terrible taste experience. I should have went to KFC, at least their taste is legit and would have saved 50% like the time I switched to Geico!"}
{"text":"Very slow service.  40min to make some wings. Smaller orders are placed above your order, even if you are there before the new order. Ridiculous business management."}
{"text":"I work for wing stop and I love it! The location on trop and Decatur is the most fun to work at. I don't mind dealing with everyone they can be down right rude or they can be the nicest people ever it doesn't effect effect me at all!! :D"}
{"text":"Average wings. Everything was just.... ok. The fries tasted sweet for some reason which I'm not the greatest fan of. Ordered delivery of the 30 boneless wing family pack, tried lemon pepper, bbq, original hot. Also, ordered baked beans, potato salad & cole slaw. Overall, I'd give it a 5 out of 10."}
{"text":"I have been here several times but the majority if the time I see the employees yelling at each other, I have ordered to take out twice once was given the wrong order, 2nd my order was suppose to be ready at the time given online, was it ready? No it was not. The wings always good but the customer service here is pessimistic at best. ***Note to owner*** please get new management to change the service given at this place."}
{"text":"Awesome!  If you haven't tried the Louisiana Rub, you should. It is the BOMB! Just the right amount of kick. Delicious!
Sabrina P."}
{"text":"It's really really cold in here. Make sure to take a coat to bundle up! The wings are ok not the greatest and the environment is somewhat loud but not a terrible place other that it's like a meat locker."}
{"text":"One star for the soda machine ...

We were not impressed .. Where to start ...

Customer service - bad, no hello ,no welcome, no nothing .. Attitude like they didn't want to be there or wanted us there.

Fries - who likes soggy over salted fries? Not any of us!

Wings - we tried mild,  original hot and atomic..  They were dry, small and lacked flavor :(

Maybe it was on off nigh, but since its not worth the price, we are not coming back .. Should of gone to BWW is what all three of us said."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but multiple things had kept me from loving it. My little and I had come for the wings and beer. We didn't receive a good first impression with the girl who took our order. She had our order wrong and took a long time to get it on the register. On top of that, when we were in the middle of our order she had answered the phone....... 

After we received our food, the sauce tasted really oily and not good at all. I had gotten the mild. The chicken was hard and very breaded. The fries were soggy and not good at all. It's hard to make french fries not taste good. I think I'll stick to other places for my wing cravings."}
{"text":"I had a better experience at this Wingstop than the other one near UNLV. 

Once you enter, everyone greets you! It's very welcoming and every place should be like that. Their customer service was good and food came out pretty quick. 

The size of the wings are huge and the sauce was a pretty good amount. Lemon pepper and mild are always my go to flavors and they didn't disappoint. 

Love places with the machine that has a bunch of drinks in it. They always tend to have lemonade and I get the raspberry kind! So good to pair with wings!"}
{"text":"This is where the wings are! Make sure you get the wings with the bone in anything else and you'll be disappointed.  The flavor choices are standard with the lemon pepper being a little to weak for my taste.  I am a fan of the BBQ and Cajun flavors.  The resturant is clean and has a 95.5 rating.  The staff are polite and accommodating.  The fries are great when served hot but make sure they don't skimp on the fries. I had to ask the manager about my portion on a large once...she kindly replaced them with a bigger, fresher portion.  They are a little pricey but if you like wings, it's worth it.  Their wings are also a nice size, so you won't be mad at how small they are when you receive your food.  Overall they do okay and that is why I gave them 3 stars.  I would have given them 4 but the selfishness with the fries for the price kept them from receiving the coveted 4th star."}
{"text":"Not sure if it is just this location but it is bad.  Don't bother calling in an order or using the app. on a phone, it is a guaranteed 15-20 minute wait no matter what.  Longer if they are busy!!! Pretty sure they DO NOT drop the order till you show up.  The wings are tasty but they just increased their prices.  Forget getting a lunch for a decent price.  Wings, fries, and a drink $15.00-$20.00.  Sauces extra of course. They state the price increase is due to bigger wings.  Bigger bones too so the meat is the same amount as before.  Overall not a place to grab a lunch and you will pay a lot!!"}
{"text":"I went to bed late the night before, and still woke up at 6:30am. I don't even actively day trade stocks right now, so that was annoying.  

In spite of the less than stellar start to the day, my favorite Asian agreed to meet me for lunch and I offered her a choice between wings or ramen.  Deep down I knew she was gonna pick chicken wings, but nearly every fiber of my being was hoping she would surprise me again and go for ramen.  It was barely in the mid 50s at the time we were exchanging texts, negotiating my term of unconditional something or other.  While she casually mentioned that she wasn't at home but was at one of the mid-tier Strip hotel.  Okay, maybe the guy spent all his budget on 12 Blue Moon and 8 Red Bull (sugar free), plus the room and there was nothing left for brunch. Whatever the case, he is off to ride back to his crib on the West side or Cali or wherever.  A lot of weeds to whack to get the girl, that's just the reality and the struggle.

Anyway, I will skip the tangential details and get straight down to the business of reviewing my very first ever Wingstop experience.  As you are probably already aware, there are multiple Wingstop locations dotted throughout the Las Vegas valley.  Most locations open at 11am, but this location on Tropicana wins the early bird prize by opening at 9am.  

The simple menu is the same, as far as I can tell, across all locations.  You basically have wings (classic bone-in and boneless) and crispy chicken tenders to select from, with 11 wing flavors and whatever limited time promo they are offering.  The dipping sauces (ranch, honey mustard, blue cheese and spicy chipotle) are extra, unless you order their combos or family packs. Their fries are actually not bad, and a large is really more than enough.

Service is swift and professional. But your order will still take up to 18 minutes, which the cashier will inform you as you place your order.  So call ahead or be prepared to wait.

The wings was just okay, because my wings were on the overcooked side, and not really moist and juicy.  The Cajun sauce was spicy, but tolerable, but eat a lot and the heat will build up and surely burn you later.  Lemon Pepper was good, but damn was it salty.  Hawaiian was decent, with mild sweetness and no heat.  You also have the option to ask for your wings to be served \"wet\".

Overall, the food was okay (3 stars).  Spending time catching up over a bunch of fried chicken wings with my fav Asian, talking about random stuff made the Wingstop excursion well worth the price of a 24 piece family pack (which was surprisingly heavy - pretty sure it is enough to split with 4 people with normal appetite).  I would do it again if she still wants wings."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at  Wing Stop and it won't be my last. These are the best wings I've ever had, espeically here in Vegas. They're nice and crispy on the outside, but not fried so long that they're dry. I have two favorites. The first are the lemon pepper; they're sauceless (unless you count the grease as sauce) but they have enough flavor you don't need any sauce or dip. My second favorite are the hot (sauced), which are barely spicy to me, but have really good flavor. The hot wings are also their signature, so of course they have to be good right?

They also serve boneless wings, boneless strips, gliders, and five or six different sides. I got fries to go and that wasn't really a good idea. When I got them home they were really soggy, so I don't suggest getting them as a side if you're taking food to go...but they'd probably be excellent if you ate them there.

Overall I HIGHLY recommend to anybody looking for a good place to eat wings, not only in the North Las Vegas area, but in Vegas period!"}
{"text":"I kinda like this place even though it seems to take forever to get your order.  Then you get the food and wish you'd ordered more.  The prices are pretty good and they have some good deals.  It is a good place to grab some dinner to go.  Sitting at Christown (unless you are mid-shop grazing) is kind of a sad thing.  The decor is clean as are the bathrooms.  The staff seems to change often and probably get minimum wage so you can take that as it is.  The wings themselves are cooked well and the sauce choices are intriguing and really very good.  Fries not eaten there are limp but otherwise they are homemade deliciousness.  I like the place for a change of pace from the usual fast food.  Dealing with Christown (as it is now) is the only drawback."}
{"text":"I have given Wing Stop a try twice so far. The first time I dined in and the second time I ordered take-out, but unfortunately, I did not enjoy the food here. 

Garlic Parmesan Wings (regular and boneless) - the taste is not too bad, but after eating two wings, I feel like I have to stop because it becomes too salty!

Smoked BBQ Wings (boneless) - the chicken was very soggy, both times.

Seasoned Fries - pretty soggy, some were not cooked very well. 

Sweet Tea - I usually love sweet tea, but this was very bland. I should have just filled up my cup with unsweetened tea!

Also, I thought it was weird that when you dine in, the \"napkins\" that they provide is a community roll of hard brown paper that you have to tear off (located next to the drink machine) Really?!?!

The only plus is that they have very friendly employees who are more than happy to explain the menu to you or make any suggestions. 

Sorry Wing Stop, I'll be going elsewhere for my chicken wing fix!"}
{"text":"They call it wingSTOP for a reason. Because you have to stop everything you're doing for at least half an hour just to wait for your food. It took me over 30 minutes just to get my 8 wings at lunchtime today. No wings are worth that kind of time. Boo wingSTOP."}
{"text":"I've never had wingstop before but this was the biggest disappointment. My fries were old cold and look black I asked for medium and received hot): Now i can't even eat my food."}
{"text":"I love this location. They always get my order right and I never have to ask for extra sauce. Unlike BWW where they think 2 drops of sauce is an acceptable amount for your wings. They always deliver great service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The wings are just ok and are overpriced.  You're better off going to Buffalo Wild Wings or Wings Over Madison."}
{"text":"I will never spend money here again. Made a large order of different wings and the lady broke down my order in pieces to charge more. She also charged for every ranch and sauce and what angered me the most was I got home and there was not 1 single sauce. They forgot everything and upcharged me without saying anything. DO NOT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"My BFF and I were walking in Christown Spectrum Mall last night when we came upon Wingstop. Leaning over the bar that separates the mall from the restaurant, we decided that one day we'd return for beer and wings. But, mostly for the beer and to people watch...because that's what one does at CS Mall. After parting ways, I decided to give Wingstop a shot and was pleasantly surprised. 

The restaurant was nearly empty when I walked in at 8 there was a young couple with their baby cart on a counter and a lady with a Wal-Mart shopping cart with her purchases (including a case of beer). Wingstop doesn't have a huge menu but they have the basics for survival: wings, fries, beer. With nine sauces from which to chose---Atomic, Cajun, Original Hot, Mild, Hickory Smoked BBQ, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan, Hawaiian and Teriyaki---there's a great variety of options. I sampled the Atomic and instantly knew that my mouth and stomach would hate me if I selected that sauce. Instead, I ordered a 10 piece boneless combo and Pacifico. I was given the option of two sauces---Original Hot and Garlic Parm, in this case---and a dip, blue cheese. After being informed it would take about nine minutes, I took a seat to take in the scene. 

First, I have to say the customer service was incredible. It's truly appreciated when young people exhibit even mediocre customer service skills and the crew here were solid. 

As for the food, the wings were very good. The Original Hot are your basic wing sauce, nothing too fancy; the Garlic Parm was great with a generous sprinkling of parmesan cheese. The fries, as the website state, are fresh-cut and you can tell they're not processed in the normal fashion of fries, which is a good thing. You can even request more of your sauce or another from the list in which to dip your fries or wings. Sweet! The only complaint I have is the paper towels are only one roll located at the front counter. I guess I can understand keeping costs down by limiting the amount of waste that could happen, but wings can get messy.

Tuesday nights they have a $2 beer special: all beer is only $2!

By the time I left the front dining area had filled up a bit more, an encouraging sign. If you find yourself in the CS Mall area, stop on by. Entrances are from the parking lot and the mall."}
{"text":"Nice location.  Wait time was reasonable.  Will definitely come back.   Nice easy to use app."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love chicken. I always order the original hot with fries and blue cheese dressing. The fries are soo good and so is the dressing. I love the fact your order is fresh so i dont mind waiting,  tho its a little pricey. The area is really clean and the updated drink machine is a great addition to the place"}
{"text":"I didn't know this place existed and we happen to come across it as we were driving by.  The people who work there are really friendly, the food is good, but it's quite expensive IMO.  I probably won't be back any time soon but good to know there's a wing stop around if I'm ever in the mood."}
{"text":"Close and convenient. It does the trick when I'm in the mood for wings.

Go on Tuesdays or Wednesdays and they have 50 cent wings. Why do I always end up there on a Thursday or Monday, though. Grrr.

They don't have nearly the variety of a Buffalo Wild Wings, but they are pretty inexpensive so that's a plus."}
{"text":"The wings are usually not my favorite from Wingstop, but I can't resist their fries and what's not to love about Wing Tuesdays and Wednesdays! I'm always interested in a discount but unfortunately this deal only applies to boneless wings, which I'm not don't really like, but a deal's a deal.

This location is good for some takeout after a long shopping session. I prefer the spicy or Hawaiian and you have to order fries, that's the best thing at Wingstop. I just wish they had more variety of flavors."}
{"text":"Tried there 10 pack with 2 sauces and 1 dip the boneless are amazing nice and crunchy and the sauces dont disappoint. Very good values there are alot of combo packs so eating here is affordable. Sauce choices seem a bit short I was kind hopeingfor more variety.

 The frys are seasoned and rate flaverful. Place is kinda tacky with airplane parrs all over the walls also there is limited seating but didn't really take away from the experience over all I think it's better than buffalo wild wings in my opinion beer choices are decent as well. Lots to choose from. Give it a try today."}
{"text":"Every time I order from here my food is hot and fresh and if I called in my order and my food was ready before I got there they always give me a fresh batch of hot fries!!!! Two thumbs up for me!!!!! Food is good customer service is good"}
{"text":"I mean it's WINGSTOP! I prefer them over all wing places here in the valley and I've tried a handful of them. The wings are never too greasy, the fries are delish especially when paired with their honey mustard sauce. The only thing is the wait. Yes I'm a bit impatient but knowing that they come up fresh does make up for it and now that I can pre-order online, even better."}
{"text":"It's WINGSTOP need I say more? Really do I? Ok, fine. Their wings come fried up with flavor and is always a hit with me. I used to not be a fan of their french fries as they seemed mediocre BUT dip them in the honey mustard sauce and it brings their stock up 50 pts. This is a great place for lunch or dinner but I do suggest ordering online if you are not going to eat here because they do take a while to cook. That's how you know they are fresh. 

Service is always nice and patient especially when you're boyfriend can't decide what flavors he wants. I don't blame him they all look pretty good but I stick to my Lemon Pepper (my favorite) and Parmesan."}
{"text":"It's 8:19 on a Thursday... arrived to a locked door only to have it opened by a gentleman and be told they weren't taking anymore orders. No sign, no reason... just \"we not taking no more orders, y'all have a good night\". Yeah.... I tried to give this place a second chance this location has completely left a bad taste in my mouth... figuratively speaking."}
{"text":"Tonight we got our usual (5 boneless bbq/5 boneless hawaiian, large fries, 2 sides of ranch) and tonight MARA answered the phone. 

What was different about ordering tonight at Wingstop was MARA!  Customer service, energy and enthusiasm! This girl made me feel like I was talking to one of my girlfriend's. She even asked us if we wanted to add something extra to our usual, and named off the items. 

We got extras; dinner rolls! How could we not?! As she ended our call she said, \"Excited to see you!\" 

Thank you MARA for making a lame pick up order special!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I stopped by here for a quick bite this afternoon. The service was definitely great. They were super friendly and even offer us refill on our way out. The general dining area is very clean. Love it. 

I ordered a 6 wings combo with 3 Mango Habanero flavor and 3 Hawaiian flavor (all flat). It comes with seasoned French fries and a soda. The sauce is definitely hot but the flavor was just average. I do like the French fries. They were seasoned very well. The combo is only approx $9. Definitely a good deal. My friend ordered boneless chicken that was breaded and he hated it lol. 

I will probably come back here again to try different flavor. All in all I think its average."}
{"text":"One of my favorite wing spots just opened near my favorite library.   I am always in need of a great and awesome location to pick up food when I am headed to the library to read/study.   This place just happens to be my all time favorite. 

Brand spanking new with my favorite lemon pepper wings and hand cut fries.   Order online or with the app.   Could life be any better?   I think not."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat wings! This location is fast and so nice! Their food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Wings of this chain restaurants are great. Not dry, tender and juicy and brings out flavors to each of their own. It's one of the wings place that I'd go when craving for wings. However, there's usually a \"but\" to it. Look, I'm not trying to be some snobby critique like some people are now these days, I just want to let people who enjoy food as I do to understand what they are getting into. So, this Wingstop place, good wings, but customer service feels neglected. They weren't terrible with bad attitude or anything like that, just feel unwelcome and the waiting was helluva long wait. I actually work across from them and I was on my lunch break. I my lunch break is only 30 minutes. It took me 2 minutes of walk to get there and 2 minutes back. So, that left me with 26 minutes of lunch break. That's exactly how long it took them to finish my wings, unfortunately. What's even funny is that, I was the only customer there. I order 3 flavored wings, a drink, and a side of fries. 4 cajun, 4 teriyaki, and 3 Louisiana. Food was very delicious though. The interior place was nicely clean, but rather it was very empty because no customer, only me. But that's about it. I have been to many Wingstop from California to Arizona and all of my wait has always been around 10 - 15 minutes even when they are people that ordered ahead of me. The max wait usually should be 20 minutes, but here I just don't understand why this place take them so long to cook wings."}
{"text":"Poor customer service and satisfaction! Ordered a combo through the app but once I arrived I informed the cashier that I didn't want the drink or the dipping sauce that comes with it. Instead I just asked for a small cup of cheese (on the app it only showed like an extra $1.67 for cheese) as a replacement and she said that cheese cost way more than the drink. She continued to still charge me full price even though I didn't get a drink, just think that's poor service especially seeing as I place multiple orders there."}
{"text":"I'm deeply devised that they messed up my order. I really really like wing stop but after today I'm extremely upset. I order online boneless Cajun wings instead I got classic Cajun wings"}
{"text":"I decided to try Wingstop out one evening after work when I had a craving for wings. I wanted badly to call my order in on my way over so I wouldn't have to wait at the counter, but after reading other reviews against this practice, I decide to just cool my heels and wait in the restaurant. 

It was around 8pm, a few families were in there eating, one patron walked in ahead of me. Orders were placed quickly, and within 20 minutes I had my wings. I was pleased (lucky?) I didn't have any issue with food, wait or service. My daughter and I both enjoyed our wings at home. 

I will be back to try different flavors, hopefully everything goes as smoothly as the first time."}
