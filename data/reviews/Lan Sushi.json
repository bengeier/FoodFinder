{"text":"Love this place! Good, fresh, reliable sushi! The menu isn't extensive but its good! Great combos and great lunch prices! Nice and cheap! I usually get take out since the dining area isn't the most inspiring but there are tables and chairs to sit and have a bite."}
{"text":"For years I have been waiting for a place in my neighbourhood that delivers Japanese food! I called and found out that I live just out of their delivery area but for a completely reasonable fee, they would deliver. Not only was the phone and delivery service friendly and accommodating,  my items were all correct, at the right temperature (no sushi rice sitting in the fridge from the morning and reheated) and very tasty! I will absolutely be ordering from Lan Sushi again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It's sad how a business can avoid completely alienating a loyal repeat customer, but chooses not to to save a couple of dollars, and to save their pride.  I USED to go here, until one night when I placed an order for delivery, and waited an hour before calling them back to see what happened, and they told me that I placed an order for pickup.  If I wanted pickup, I would have said pickup...   They told me that the food has been ready for some time now, and they can deliver it now.  I told them that I wanted a new meal as I didn't want the cold food that's been sitting in their takeout box for an hour now (since I ordered the teriyaki chicken with rice which is a hot dish).  Also, I specifically asked them to deliver to the back door, 3 times.  They delivered to my front door... As my alarm was going off, the delivery guy told me that this was the original cold order that's been sitting for an hour.  I was hungry, and grumpy, so I presented the money to give to the delivery driver, but he pulled the food away!! saying \"do you want to the food or not?!\", as if to taunt me and to punish me for not picking up my order.  I couldn't believe this.  Here I am, giving him the money, and he doesn't want it???   To me, the emotion and experience behind the food is actually more important than the food itself.  I told him I didn't want this.  Meaning, to be bullied into giving my money to someone who's clearly on a powertrip.  Lan Sushi.  Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi for dinner -- Philadelphia roll, spicy California, and red dragon. We were underwhelmed based on the prior reviews posted. Food was very fresh, but we expected more creative, filling rolls. If you are looking for cheap, yet tasty take out, this is the place."}
{"text":"Loved the place. Best sushi I've tried in a while. Complementary hand roll while I was waiting for my order was a nice gesture. Lovely staff too"}
{"text":"They haven't closed! They have a new location at  1500 Royal York RD. #35 (M9P 3B6). They're located in the second level of the strip mall/plaza.   Very fresh food, friendly staff and quick service. There is not much room to sit so probably best to do take-out. I'm so glad they're in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. wish more business was like this. Sushi is reasonably priced and tasty.   Not the best for dining in. When it gets busy prepare to wait, I will continue to go there."}
{"text":"I would move to The Junction just to be closer to Lan Sushi.  The service is friendly, prompt, helpful and very efficient.  I ordered a small maki party platter ($30) and the lobster maki ($11) and every single last piece of sushi was a work of art, fresh and delicious.  The green dragon roll (which was part of the platter) is just the right mix of spicy and sweet.  The simple (very clean) decor should not fool you - the quality of the sushi is as good if not better than the downtown sushi hot spots.  I live on the east side but will travel back to Lan Sushi soon, and I am bringing friends.  My only complaint is that this gem is not located closer to me."}
{"text":"Really good, satisfying sushi, really low prices, *really* good service.  It's great to finally have a quality sushi place in the junction.   Plus they always give me a free roll while I'm waiting for takeout."}
{"text":"Love it here! I live ten minutes away and order from them a few times a month.    I don't order rolls very often mainly because rice and I do not get along, but when I do I always go for the Rainbow and Black Dragon.  Hands down the best rolls I've had and *almost* worth my body hating me for the next 48 hours.  Needless to say I tend to stick with the sashimi which is always incredibly fresh and flavourful.  The seaweed salad and edamame are great as well but honestly, it's hard to mess those up.   I've probably introduced half a dozen people to this place since they opened and every single one now calls it their favourite sushi joint."}
{"text":"Lan Sushi is one of the best hidden gems in the Junction. The staff and service is amazing and the sushi is fresh and really affordable. They always greet me with a smile and remember my order! The free hand roll while you wait is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best sushi places in the city. Their servings are very generous and always fresh. I work in the area and frequently get their lunch take-out specials. If you walk-in, you get a free hand roll. The staff is lovely and take great care with packaging your food. LOVE IT! Try their Alaska Roll, it's my favourite. If they ever had all-you-can-eat, I would die."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!  Lan Sushi is fantastic in every way. It has my highest recommendation for take-out sushi. The fish is fresh, the sushi is well prepared, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. The interior is also very clean, functional, and cute, and serves as a great place to sit for a quick lunch. Preferably, it's where you wait for a few minutes while your excellent take-out sushi is prepared. Lan gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the dining room just isn't the place for a nice sushi dinner. Get it to go! Great food.  4 stars"}
{"text":"watch niceness.  My only (very small) complaint is that the spicy mayo and tempura crumble gets stuck to the top of the take out container. You could eat it to stay or just put the bits back on the maki.  Everything else has been said below."}
{"text":"Excellent Food for a reasonable price. Usually get a complimentary hand roll with your order as well."}
{"text":"We love Lan Sushi and we're so happy it moved into the neighbourhood. The sushi is fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. We usually get the Sushi Combo, Avo-Q rolls and Yam rolls and all are excellent. The people who work here are always very friendly. Great take-out spot!"}
{"text":"When we lived in Bloor West Village, you couldn't throw a cat without hitting an overpriced, underwhelming sushi joint.  When we moved to the Junction, there wasn't any sushi at all!  Wherever would us hipsters eat?  Then along comes Lan Sushi!    The food there is amazing, and very well priced.  The people running the place are extremely friendly and know us by name already!  They give my wife a free hand roll every time she goes in to pick up an order!  I love these guys!    Sure there's no place to sit and eat in the restaurant itself, but who cares!  Go home and eat it in front of your X-Box 360 during a spirited game of Modern Warfare 2.  Am I right ladies?"}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh and the staff were really friendly. The only downside to the sushi was our roll were not tight and kept falling apart. The wait was pretty long. I would definitely come back for the sushi mi but would not order the rolls again."}
{"text":"My $13 unagi don consisted of approximately half a cup of rice, topped with a few very thin strips of unagi. Definitely no more than two ounces of meat. Perhaps the price would be justified were the food of very high quality; however, my meal was very average. I would not recommend this place. Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi that I've ever had. It is so fresh, it's unbelievable! The service is always friendly and the complimentary hand roll is lovely. A really nice neighbourhood spot that I HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good cheap sushi! I'm from Vancouver and have pretty high expectations for sushi and this beat a couple places I've been to back home. The server gave us salmon or tuna mix rolls on the house and they were delicious! My meal was also great. I ordered the maki combo a. I usually think california rolls taste pretty bland but here it tasted fresh and they weren't falling all over the place. I couldn't finish the whole combo and I still have 1/3 left in my fridge :). One thing I didn't like about the place was the lighting and lack of seating, but I guess most of the customers just order take out. I also loved their little pocky and teacup section. So glad I stumbled upon this place!"}
{"text":"I live less than 5km from Lan and they refused to deliver here, stating that we were \"out of their area\".  That makes no sense at all.  Very disappointed and will not again visit in person either."}
{"text":"I don't know how this sushi restaurant exists in the market and how people gave it 4 stars.  It's worth nothing to me. The sashimi quality is very low. It is  below average. The fish size cut in a very small pieces. Don't believe it!!!  The unagi don, the eel is cold. It should be served in warm.   Won't come back."}
{"text":"I've been there several times, very good, well priced for take out. They have a small space to eat in but not very fancy.  Very friendly, nice people with very good sized sushi!"}
{"text":"Love lan sushi!  Amazing customer service and great food. I go for lunch there every now and then. If you love sushi i highly recommend lan sushi."}
{"text":"Went there for takeout! They were a little slow getting our rolls together considering there was no one else waiting, but they made us free handrolls (which were delicious) so we absolutely forgave them. With the prices as cheap as they are, it's a wonder how they can afford to do that for everyone. We got the stuff home still warm - a nice trick leaving a steam hole for the gyoza so that they don't get soggy.  So overall it was awesome, and we'll probably go again :)"}
{"text":"Take out sushi place - how good could it be, right? Pretty good, as it turns out. This is now our 'we want sushi but feel guilty about eating out' place. I always call to order ahead of time - have never walked in. Probably mentioned before - but cash or debit only! No credit cards.   Out of the four times I've gone, I've received the much talked about free handroll once. BUT it was on a night where I was absolutely STARVING after a long day at work, and I was so hungercranky... My husband said that when I got into the car with the sushi clutching my free handroll (which was promptly devoured) I looked like I had just been given a million dollars. (Yes, food makes me that happy)"}
{"text":"I came here based on the rave reviews on Yelp. The shop itself is quite underwhelming, it's mainly a take out place so don't expect to dine-in.    The service was good, not exceptional. We were greeted upon arrival and given time to look at the menu to decide what to order. Everything is given in take-out containers, to go along with the take out theme.   So what did I like about my experience?  The sashimi and rolls were fresh and good, time for food service was quick, prices were decent.   Would I come back again? Not in a hurry, but if I were to pass by and suddenly develop a craving for sushi. Yes."}
{"text":"I have been to many sushi places, but this place makes the best tasting sushi ever. Everything here tastes so fresh. I usually order the veggie combo. Their sushi with the shiitake mushrooms is amazing. For the price, you get a decent amount of sushi. The service is very friendly. I also love how they give you a free handroll. I love this place!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I've ever had! Out of all the different countries , this one is the best"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, delicious and inexpensive sushi. Doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"Nicely made rolls with good proportion of ingredients and perfectly cooked and seasoned rice.  It's a takeout place mostly, and the prices are reasonable enough that I don't feel guilty going often...which I do."}
{"text":"Fantastic Sushi!  I really enjoy it! There Spicy Salmon is delicious and they are always very nice and courteous.  Often times while waiting you will get a hand-roll to nibble.   Their lunch combo's are perfect and such a great price.  I rely on them weekly and am never let down :)"}
{"text":"Once again we were directed to this place by yelp. With a plus four rating we figured all was well. This is a small space that is primarily directed to take out, but with two small tables and one four seater cocktail table, it can accommodate the rare eat in customer, like us. Nice clean atmosphere, with quick service after we ordered. Very fresh. Sushi pizza, delicious. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and well-made! Good prices. +1 for the complimentary salmon/cucumber hand roll, it was delicious. I find it's a hit and miss, sometimes I get one and other times I don't.   Only negatives are they don't accept credit cards, and it's not a great place to sit down and eat, definitely a take-out type of sushi place. But there's free green tea if you get thirsty. :)"}
{"text":"Trekking to the junction to find the best super cheap sushi joint in the city, really? Well, certainly not a single reason to go to the junction, but if you happen to be in the neighbourhood and want to nibble on some fresh, well-priced rolls I highly suggest it.  It's a sparse, bright, single room suitable more for take-out rather than dining in with a self serve tea canister equipped with Dixie Cups.  I would give Lan sushi four stars, however the people who work/own the place are soooo friendly. They either genuinely love their customers or are just amazing actors (Hollywood worthy really).  +1 for a complimentary hand roll while you're waiting -1 for the Cher and Cher covers..."}
{"text":"The service bumps this take out sushi place from a two to three stars. The service is quick and friendly, however the food is pricey for the quality. Ordered three rolls including the beef roll, inwhich the beef was too chewy and dry to enjoy, had to force it down. The spicy salmon and tempura roll were tolerable, maybe it was too close to end of day though."}
{"text":"Lan Sushi is the newest business on the street and unless you are a Junctionite, you have no idea how much this area needs a sushi joint!  Aaaaaaand, far so good. The restaurant itself is really just a walk up/take out place at the moment. They've painted the place up a bit and added some nice decorative touches which distinguish it from the two places it's been recently (Bronto Burger and Jocelyn's Place) but it still could use some improvements. There are a few chairs set up by the window and one high table (like a bar table) with 4 high stools. It feels a bit unfinished but maybe they're still in the process of determining their set up and staffing.  The maki options are standard, but not in a bad way. To start I had the lunch sashimi combo ($11) which came with salmon, octopus, tuna and tilapia. It came with miso and sushi rice and was relatively fine, the fish was fresh and tasty and the octopus was a pleasant surprise.  We also ordered Maki combo A ($11.50) which featured a tasty california roll, a HUGE dynamite roll and a spicy roll that made my mouth happy! I enjoy a sushi place that doesn't skimp on the spicy in their rolls. Also? No mayonnaise to be seen so far. (Mayonnaise is the sushi kiss of death in my opinion.)  The stars are missing because this is still a new place, the menu is far and away from fleshed out, the seating is strange and the rolls are simple. Give them a few months and I'll re-review, but as it's the only game in town, I'm sure I'll be mosying my way through the menu soon enough."}
{"text":"When you want sushi in the area, Lan Sushi is currently your only option, but thankfully they do everything just right.  I have many friends who go to Lan Sushi so frequently (because they like it so much) that the hostess knows them all by name. I find the owner (or head chef, I'm not sure) always has a friendly smile going on when I go in, which feels especially warm when he walks out to give you a complementary hand roll while you wait for your meal to go.  The sushi's good quality, but smaller than what I'm used to. For a meal I'll always order two dishes from Lan, which usually does the trick. t I don't recommend eating in the restaurant. You can, and I have, but it's pretty pointless. It's a takeout shop and the atmosphere doesn't really help you enjoy your food or your company (people are always coming in and out of the store right beside you and are all just ordering or standing around and waiting for their food. So just take it to go and enjoy it at home."}
{"text":"Lan is my go-to sushi place in the Junction.  I don't even live there but will drive the 15 minutes to get takeout.  I also always stop in and grab something when I'm in the 'hood shopping etc.   The service is super friendly and they always give you a complimentary hand roll while waiting (which btw, is always amazing). There is also complimentary hot tea.   There isn't much for seating (2 tables and window), but if you can snag a seat at the window and people watch while eating, you're golden.  I have ordered a lot of items from the menu, from the spicy tuna/salmon etc. to spider roll, to unagi... it's all fantastic and fresh.  I am absolutely a repeat customer. These guys know how to keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Had a yam roll and the alaska roll, I completely agree with the previous yelpers this place is amazing! They add this delicious sauce to the rolls and even the rice used in the rolls tastes ridiculously good, deliciously vinegary. Definitely recommend, I found my new favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"this is in my opinion the best take out sushi in the entire city. Ive had take out at many many many many places in this city and nothing compares.  We usually order the medium maki party tray and maybe some tempura. The rice is always freshly made, the fish is always fresh (although sometimes not sliced very neatly) and the orders always come with some poky! one or two times our tempura has been a bit chewy/stale but the sushi is so damn good I let that slide.  I'm not sure what type of soy sauce they use but it isnt salty but full of flavor and is I am guessing usukuchi which is a more mild version and in my opinion superior to koikuchi.  The only frustrating thing that usually happens is the woman who usually answers the phone does not speak english very well and usually gets intercepted by someone else who does speak english. we order alot so they ended up just knowing us by name which was nice."}
{"text":"I consider myself a huge sushi snob and good sushi is hard to come by. So when I moved to the junction - I was worried about finding a new go-to sushi place... until I ate at LAN Sushi. By far the best sushi I've had - and that goes for any neighborhood. Even if I moved out of the area - I'd definitely make an effort to eat at this place. They deliver too ! Sushi is fresh, generous servings and the menu is very inexpensive for the quality of sushi you're getting. The employees are super friendly as an added bonus - even the delivery guys !! Eat here. FANTASTIC sushi !!!!"}
{"text":"The one merit this place has is that it is the only sushi place in the junction. Owners try really hard to please every new patron that walks through the door. Prices are ok on the high side. Sashimi lunch is small in quantity and if you choose to get a can of Pop instead of the soup make sure you don't take an Ice Tea from the fridge. I was called on that by the lady at the cashier while I was eating my lunch, which made me feel quite bad, and charged me 25 cents...not a good sense of business etiquette from her if you ask me, since I also left a good tip.. I will probably won't be back. Nothing to write home about. Decent food, ok prices, won't wow your taste buds..."}
{"text":"The fish at Lan Sushi is still as fresh as ever. They still offer hand rolls while you're waiting for your order. They also read their reviews which I think is very awesome of them to do. And they now know me by name. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!   I have been four times now and it is fresh, consistent and reasonable. I usually get the Spicy maki-combo and a wakame salad.  Plus, the owners are so very cheerful!   The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I would like to sit in and eat, and save on so much packaging."}
{"text":"There are some seats to eat your sushi but I feel it's best to do take-out. The sushi is tasty and affordable. While I wait for my food I can serve myself some tea.  The staff are nice, the food is yummy and it won't break your wallet.  Win"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood but didn't try this sushi place for a long time since I already had a favourite in nearby Roncy (sushi 67).  But after reading the great reviews here, I decided to try it.  Ordered the medium sushi (or was it the sushi/sashimi?) combo for pickup.  The order was ready and got the free handroll (yummm).  However, I think the handroll was my favourite part of the meal.  The sushi was good but nothing special.  I would definitely put sushi 67 (unfortunately now closed) way above Lan.  Now to find a new go-to sushi joint...*sigh*"}
{"text":"This is my go-to neighbourhood sushi place. It's 95% takeout but there are a couple tables if you want to sit down. The fish is always fresh and the food is consistent. Service is fast and friendly.   My faves: Salmon & Tuna sushi/sashimi, Spicy Tuna Salad, Sushi Pizza, Alaska Roll, Red Dragon/Green Dragon.  I've also ordered party platters in the past and they turned out great.   They sometimes give you a free hand roll while you're waiting too - I think it's usually bbq salmon.  Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Delicious!   Best sushi I have ever had!  Quick and friendly service. Will definitely be back. Mmmmm so good!"}
{"text":"I found Lan Sushi about a year ago (November 2013) when I started working in The Junction, and walked with a co-worker to grab some sushi one day for lunch. It was SO. GOOD. I was amazed at how fresh and real it tasted. Soon, the whole office was joining in and it became a highly-anticipated weekly tradition to get sushi. (Usually \"Sushi Thursday's.\")  Lan Sushi doesn't load their sushi with vinegar or lemon (yay) nor do they do what a lot of other sushi restaurants are guilty of - giving you 70% rice, 30% vegetables/fish. Lan Sushi's rice takes a back seat to the vegetables/fish (depending on what you order), which is perfect. If you order a salmon roll, for example, the salmon will dominate with confidence.  Their lunch combos are delicious, very filling, and well-priced. 12 pieces of sushi for around $8 including tax? That's awesome.  Lan Sushi has the kind of sushi you crave and dream about. For REAL. It's my favourite sushi place in Toronto (hands-down!), and now that I'm not working in The Junction, I sometimes find myself travelling to the west end specifically for this sushi. It's so worth it. Go get some!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi and I can tell you that this place stands out as a gem in the Junction area amongst many average sushi joints in the city.   While the fish is always fresh, it is the greater emphasis on flavour / texture combinations that makes this place stand out. Even on a party tray they use some premium ingredients, which is unusual for most sushi restaurants.   The price is fantastic and service outstanding. They seem to always give you something for free, which is such a nice touch and makes you feel like you're their favourite customer.   I love this place and have ordered at least 50 times. Thanks you guys. Don't ever lose your passion. - Steve"}
{"text":"Great food I've ordered a few times from them, however for home delivery they only take cash.....wth?? They, of course, only mention this once I've placed my order, given my contact info (buzz code) etc etc.   Very annoying!"}
{"text":"Updating my review to say that Lan Sushi is consistently awesome, the food is always top notch, they ruined me for any other sushi place downtown, I now compare everyone's vegan options to Lan Sushi' and no one compares in freshness, portion size and taste. My husband eats fish, often gets double the order of spicy combo because it's THAT GOOD! The owners and their staff are all lovely people and are so nice to my kids, which is a huge plus. Lan Sushi is a must try, you are guaranteed to come back many times to try everything on the menu, you will be loudly greeted with the owners calling out your first name with a huge smile, you can't beat that."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening with a huge festival going on Dundas st. Restaurant was empty and they put the chairs on the table and said only take out. Oddly enough they weren't partaking in the huge outdoor festivities. Food tasted average but the colour of the salmon roll compared to the hae dop bop was very noticeably off colour. Don't think I would visit here again as there are many other options around."}
{"text":"One of my favourite non-AYCE sushi places. The prices are fair, and the sushi is great, especially their spicy salmon.  Normally I am not a fan of hand-rolls, but this place makes the BEST and ONLY hand-rolls I ever eat...not to mention they often give you a complimentary one while you wait."}
{"text":"This place probably has some of the best sushi I've had outside Japan. The fish always tastes very fresh, and they don't try to skimp like some other places do.  I almost always get the $10 spicy combo, and even when I think it won't be enough to fill me up, I'm never hungry once I'm done. The staff is also always very friendly!  I wish that they had more of a sit-down area and an option other than take-out, but they're probably affordable because they don't really offer a sit-down option."}
{"text":"3.5*  I thought this place was OK for a takeout place.  Atmosphere:  Space was not used to its full potential.  HUGE ass space in front of the takeout/cash area where there is absolutely no seating.  Instead, seating is concentrated towards front entrance of restaurant.  Décor/furniture is sorta ugly, mishmash of random, leftover pieces, see:  photos.  YES, you do get a complimentary handroll while you wait.  :)  I think we got Cali which is a very nice touch!  Food was well presented, but done so in takeout trays.  (I'm sure that they can make it into more of a restaurant if they wanted to!)  There was a self-serve tea carafe which I also appreciated.  Food was good.  I wasn't too fond of the sweet brown sauce which was atop the Green Dragon & Alaska Roll, but my bf liked it.  Everything was fresh, that's for sure.  My least favourite thing was the Agedashi Tofu which was more like breaded, pressed tofu steaks.  Decent, and I believe only, sushi place in The Junction area.  I wouldn't hesitate to visit again if I was nearby!"}
{"text":"For a non-ayce take out place I really enjoyed Lan Sushi. Their sashimi was amazing! Probably the best I've tried thus far.  My boyfriend and I shared the sashimi-sushi platter (#1 I believe) for $26 and an order of spicy salmon for $4. We were both full when we left.  After looking for sushi for hours, I was so excited we finally found this spot.  There are no washrooms and it's strictly for takeout but there is a pitcher (not sure if that's the right word) of hot green tea and a bar against the window with some stools and a high and a low table if you choose to eat there."}
{"text":"WHERE IS THE FURNITURE?!?  That said, The Junction needed a Sushi place. And we got one in the site of the former Bronto-Burger. Good news!  The take-out sushi I had was pretty good, with fairly reasonable prices for the large and filling rolls I took home.  However, I didn't intend to get take out. This place oesn't really offer anywhere to sit! There is one table and a bar by the window.  I'm just happy to have a sushi place around the corner from my place."}
{"text":"Great little take-out sushi place with a few small tables. The food was surprisingly great and fresh. Loved the miso soup and wakeme salad. Super fast and friendly service, and good value for the price. You get some free hot tea and a cone-roll while you wait. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best sushi rolls in Toronto downtown - ish area. Their sashimi isn't bad but it's not as amazing as their rolls. They only take cash or debit. No credit and not much seating area. But they're pretty quick for take our orders and very convenient for Junction area locals. Their prices aren't too bad either but it is not AYCE. Only menu a la carte."}
{"text":"I've never had the food here...called to order delivery and was informed that they only do cash. Meh. Will review once a) I pre-think my dinner choice for the night and pick up some cash and b) they get with the 21st century and accept plastic over the phone. Only then will I have their sushi."}
{"text":"Such great, fresh sushi here.  I go in for takeout sometimes, and I've never had to wait more than ten minutes for my order.  They also have a lot of interesting things to buy on the side, like cool chopsticks and pocky stick.  They make a mean Philly roll!"}
{"text":"Of all the sushi places in the city this is for sure my favourite... Which is what prompted me to re-review these guys and bump them up a star. The sushi here is super fresh and I really love their spicy combo (spicy salmon, spicy tuna and cucumber rolls) and their spicy salmon pizza... what can I say I'm a sucker for all things deliciously spicy.   Their service is excellent; they read all their Yelp reviews, learn their regular customers' names and are always in a cheery mood. They still don't have a customer washroom but that's ok because Sweet Potato, the amazing local grocery store across the street has a nice big one in the back. I recently found out they deliver but only within a few blocks so I still need to go there for pick ups but honestly that's no big deal.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! This is my neighbourhood sushi takeout place! It really is just a takeout place (with about 3 tables inside, but 95% of the orders are to-go). Sushi is good quality. I enjoy their Maki Combo A which comes with california rolls, spicy salmon (good proportions of salmon, tempura bits + spicy sauce, with some added salmon to top it off) and dynamite roll. I've also tried their sashimi salad (found in the fridge), which was quite good and a hefty portion. We've also ordered sushi trays for parties before. Reasonable prices and friendly service. They used to offer a free hand roll while you wait for sushi, but I find that they don't really do this anymore. I feel really fortunate to have a yummy well-priced sushi joint close to me!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.   My gf and I were looking for an ayce sushi place in DT Toronto when we stumbled upon this place. Even though it wasn't all you can eat, it was definitely worth it.   Upon walking in, it looks like your typical small take out sushi place with a small eating area. I wasn't too impressed with the eating area but once  the sushi came, it made me forget all about the small eating area. I was in a \"foodies\" paradise for the remainder of my meal. We ordered the sushi/sashimi combo and both were outstandingly fresh. The prices were fair and they have unlimited free green tea while you wait/eat. The staff was nice and attentive. What more could one ask for?   Ps. We never received a complimentary handroll while waiting but I'm not devastated, I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Lan Sushi is fantastic - quick service, delicious maki, and... free tea! Who could ask for more? Plus they do pick up. Win win."}
{"text":"I had walked past LAN sushi dozens of times and kept thinking to myself, \"I will go back there, some day!\" And of course proceeded to continue forgetting that it was there.  Finally, one day, an insatiable craving for sushi hit me, and somehow it jogged my memory of this place. Upon arrival, I found reasonably priced rolls and very fast turnaround for takeout, as well as lots of Japanese goodies for sale.  The restaurant is spartanly furnished, but it does the job.  Staff are friendly and like to ration napkins, soy sauce and wasabi (frankly, I agree with that as many restaurants throw in a handful of packets that get thrown out!). The menu is mostly sushi focused (there isn't a wide array of other Japanese foods) but it hits the spot.  The name, I'm not sure of its significance, but it sounds like an IT help manual.  Barring that, I would say that this is the best place (or maybe even only?) place to get sushi in the junction, and I would say it's a good option at that!"}
{"text":"For a sushi take-out place with minimal seating, dang this was pretty good! We were recommended this place by a nail salon near by. Thank goodness we listened. I had the sashimi lunch special combo. It comes with miso and rice. The rice is not just plain rice, it's seasoned! Whoa, that's a first. Sashimi was pretty fresh tasting =] Would definitely come back again."}
