{"text":"First time experience was fantastic, but today with terrible.  The ramen soup was mediocre at best and the noodle was soggy.  Portion was much smaller than the first time, and we were nicely charged $2.75 per green tea....  for a Japanese restaurant (you do the math).  

Anyway, the experience today ruined any hope of us ever going back again.  

Never again. 2/10"}
{"text":"Me and my friend were excited to go try some food here. Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the food and it's lack of flavor and the portions were small. The service was even worse. On the surface of the cup there were few dried green onion thingy but the server said it is a \"MANUFACTURING PROBLEM.\"
(Gosh.. better say sorry I will get you new cup.) then i showed her the cup and she said.. \"Well, it is only outside.\" then she scratched those things with her nail... so gross. 5s17.. you guys have a good server who could fight for you. I will never go back again"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the meal I had here. I went with three others to try this meal...and we were all dissatisfied with it. Let me keep it short and simple.

I ordered a Japa Bun, Tempura Oyster Mushrooms, and Japa Fries. The Japa burger was okay, nothing special. The side salad that it came with was terrible. It was extremely tart to the point that it made you cringe (I think there was way too much vinegar or something in it). The Tempura Oyster Mushrooms were extremely dry and the batter on it was clumpy. The only thing that made me give this restaurant a 2 stars out of 5 was that their Japa fries were really good. 

Service wise, I ordered the Japa Bun because it comes with a toasted sesame bun. However, when I asked the waitress she had no clue what I was talking about. She gave me a blank stare, shook her head and walked away. 

Judging from other ratings, perhaps I went on an off day. However, I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the ramen here but it was rather disappointing. The tonkotsu ramen was on the bland side and the broth wasn't flavorful enough. The noodles were a tad undercooked and the pork belly was a tad on the dry side. My friends tried the salmon sashimi in citrus soy and it looked good. The gyoza was pan fried nicely but definitely on the pricey side. $6 for 4 small gyozas is a bit steep. The restaurant was very quiet for a Tuesday night. We were the only patrons in there. Overall, I found the prices a bit high and the food fell short of expectations."}
{"text":"Service with a smile and super flavorful dish after dish ! Wonton Avocado to start put a smile on my face. Once my wife found a spelling mistake on the Saki list. It just made our day. They do a great job and well priced. I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went in under the suggestion of a friend.  Had a Teriyaki burger, gyoza, a dish I think called 'Beef Tatare' and some saké.  The gentleman service us (larger guy with a beard) was friendly and helpful answering our questions.  We really enjoyed our dinner - it was full of flavor and had fantastic aromas.  We finished out dinner off with a creme bruleé and left with full tummys.  Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"5S17 is truly a gem in Calgary's culinary scene. As a creature of habit, I usually order one item: Satoru's  Breakfast. In my mind, I like to call it Satoru's 'All Day' Breakfast. The different elements of said dish allow me to enjoy it whilst being sober or drunk, which, in my mind, makes a dish exceptional. For example, I can only enjoy foie gras when I'm sober, but not when I'm drunk. On the other hand, Satoru's Breakfast can be enjoyed in whatever state of mind one may be in. I'm hoping to try the Japa Burger next. Thank you, 5S17."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant but it fell really short of expectations.  My friends and I tried the ramen, salmon sashimi and gyozas and nothing stood out.  Gyozas were tiny and mediocore ($6 for 4 pcs).  Salmon sashimi was fresh but sliced thin and I didn't like the sauce ($8 for 6 slices).  The ramen was very disappointing - the noodles were not cooked thoroughly and it had that \"soapy taste\" when you don't rinse it enough.  The broth was aromatic but flat on the taste.  Portion was tiny for the price ($12-$14) as well.  I think they have a lot of work to do in order to succeed on 17th Ave."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dining experience here. Very high quality ramen and an all around delicious meal. I would highly recommend coming here. great location as well!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service. 2-man operation. Excellent noodles. Pork a bit over dried and eggs a little bit overcooked. But really modern Clean place to hang out. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch menu. Fresh, authentic Asian fusion (in this case not an oxymoron) and delicious. I could not recommend this place enough! Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"5S17, I love places that have cool names, the name is based on 5 Senses, also the owners name starts with a \"S\" (Satoru) and 17, obviously being located on 17. I had a great experience, I tried the tuna tartare and the kale and quinoa salad. Both were great, refreshing, loved the presentation. The salad dressing was delicious, I am looking forward to try some mains next time, I was in for a quick lunch this time. When you mix French with Japanese....well when you mix Japanese with anything, it's out of this world!"}
{"text":"For anyone of you that don't know true ramen don't post negative comments on this page. I lived in Asia for a long time and this is the best ramen I have had here. Satoru you are doing a fantastic job! Keep it up."}
{"text":"A fusion of Japanese & French cuisine, complex flavors with a lot of depth.  I had the smoked potage soup which was delicious, talked to the chef later and found out even though it looks simple the level of depth when developing the broth and getting the smoked flavor is very complex.  I also had the creme brulee and it had the perfect crack when you broke the sugar on top.  Had a great time and good friendly service, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Mediocre experience at 5S17. I stumbled across this prime real estate spot in the heart of 17th ave, and I decided to give it a shot. The layout of the restaurant is pretty cool and there is a patio, which is a huge plus for summer days. 

The ramen itself, however, is mediocre at best. The noodles felt lower quality, and the broth was only passable. Not a terrible choice in a pinch, but with so many options on 17th ave, I wouldn't see myself coming back unless I really wanted ramen. Overall, passable, and not terrible if you want to people watch from the patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place after reading some of the reviews. Ramen was mediocre at best! Dumplings were good but the sauce was way too salty! If you want good ramen there's plenty of other restaurants nearby to choose from !"}
{"text":"Really this place is 2.5 stars. The poke bowl was delicious. The ramen was ok but the duck that came with it had an odd after taste... like it had been previously frozen, got freezer burn and had picked up odd flavors. It was so bad that after two bites I couldn't eat anymore of it and resorted to eating around it. A good server would have commented on my lack of eating the duck, but sadly the server didn't bother to ask either during the meal or when removing the bowl. Like some other reviewers I got the feeling that they just didn't put that much care or attention into the ramen as they did the fish dishes. I think they should cut the ramen from their menu, or send the chef on a ramen tour so he can taste what great ramen is. Vancouver and Toronto both have much better ramen for significantly lower prices."}
{"text":"5S17 has re-opened and the new menu is Japanese focussed albeit with some subtle French flourishes- more to come on that. It's no longer \"French-Japanese fusion\" and is more focussed and I'd say better value.

My first and only visit to 5S17 in its former incarnation was a disappointment; one lunch, three items and nothing I really enjoyed. I had higher hopes yesterday since the menu makes more sense to me, and for the most part I was happy, but the experience was uneven.

I ordered the tuna poke appetizer and the curry rice bowl with chicken (beef is the other option for this dish). The appetizer was stunning- in fact if that was all I'd eaten I'd have given five stars. Cubed beautiful red tuna, green onions and minced apple alongside deep fried flour tortilla strips to scoop it up and a devastating spicy smear (it's the same sauce they use for the chili goma ramen, says the very nice server, a friendly bear who, I learn, is the new owner). Only complaint is that it's served on a rimless slate when you need a rim to get the food off the surface- please use a normal plate or better a bowl for this one.

The curry rice was a problem. First, for $16 it's rather a tiny portion. Second, the curry itself is a bit watery. Third, it comprises unpeeled boiled potatoes, which I despise. Fourth and most important is that the rice is horrible- gummy and raw on the inside. Completely unacceptable. On most marks this dish was a flop. HOWEVER! The chicken, oh lord the chicken! It was pan fried in what is clearly a holdover of the chef's French training and was just stunning. If I could have had a meal of just the tuna poke and this chicken, it'd have been a memorable meal for the right reasons.

Folks, if you're going to go the Japanese focus, and you should, then you have to get the rice perfect- not just acceptable, but perfect. I'm looking forward to trying more dishes and seeing this rice issue worked out, because you do have great potential here with a good, well thought out menu in a nice room. Fix the rice, please. And peel your potatoes."}
{"text":"Beware of any restaurant that handles your money, digs out change from a jar of tips and then handles your food and utensils without washing their hands. I've been here twice, both times I was disappointed. I went the second time hoping for a better experience, but food was cold and bland, ingredients were not fresh but the hygiene left nothing to be desired. I don't even know why I ate the food to be honest. As it never occurred to me what I may not be seeing and I had already paid for it. I'm sorry this place just isn't what it should be and clearly they need more training in food handling."}
{"text":"Came to visit Calgary and was craving Ramen. Friends suggested this and here we met.  Place was quite small, but comfortable for us a table of six. We went late afternoon so we were the only one there. The owner was great and told us about the dishes. 
To start we each had something different. 5s17's fusion menu features ramen noodle bowls, build your own poke bowls, sushi, Japenese fried wings and Asian grill. Located Mid 17th Avenue SW in Calgary, parking is in front and around. 
There was six of us so we just started off with all the appetizers. There were 3.  Japenese fried chicken, Pork dumplings and Edamame. Very flavorable but very pricey as well for the amount you got. 
We then went down the menu and had the BBQ Yakitori Chicken, Short Rib and then I chose the Ramen. I went with Duck confit. Not bad, Id say less flavorful and slightly cooler temp then i would like for Ramen.  Sushi was fresh and I didnt hear any complaints except portion sizes for all meals,  including the poke bowls. 

Overall, its pretty pricey and was trying to see the French side of things but I wasnt blown away. 

Service was good and place was clean.  Hours of operation, not so bad unless you are looking for late night, this is not it. I am glad its open around lunch time though !"}
{"text":"I went with a big group recently. Mushroom broth ramen was good, a lot of ramen places don't offer vegetarian broth so props to them! The fried tofu added something to the ramen for sure. Edamame and fries to start were good. Service is fabulous and attentive. Gluten free noodles are available as well. Cute atmosphere! Some people said their spicy ramen was not very spicy, so that could be an issue for some. Poke bowls look like a good portion. Would be interested in the sushi burrito if photos were available beforehand."}
{"text":"Casual, trendy place on 17th. Had the tuna tataki, steak tataki and dumplings, beautiful plating and very tasty. Love the environment"}
{"text":"I am at 5s17 almost three times a week. It's definitely in my top five for favourite restaurants in the city. Not only is the food delicious, it's also affordable and the service is dynamite. They always make me feel incredibly welcome when I go in there, hence why I've become such a regular.

I eat the chili goma ramen at least once a week. It's perfectly spicy and the pork is always tender. I also like the fact that the egg is marinated in soy sauce which gives it extra flavour.

The sushi burrito is also fantastic. Not many places can say they have such a thing so I'd say it's what makes 5s different from other Japanese restaurants. It's super fresh and perfect as a light meal on a hot day.

I didn't know you could have Japanese food for breakfast until I tried Saturo's Breakfast. The signature sauce with the patty and the runny egg is awesome for those weekend hangovers. It comes with baby bok choy as too so it's kind of like a healthy breakfast! 

I also enjoy the gyoza, the tuna poke and their fries. I mention their fries cause I get them literally every time I go in there. If you're a fan of those skinny McDonald's fries, you'll like the ones at 5s. And their even better because they come with a side of tasty torgarashi mayo!

Much love for 5s17 and the staff that work there :)"}
{"text":"It's surprising that they got 4stars on Yelp! 
So I was tricked there by this fake rating. In a dinner time at 5:30pm it's not busy at all, because we were the only table there. It seems to be a forgettable place in such golden location on 17 Ave.
The appetizer was fine, small amount but fresh and tasty. 
The tonkotsu Ramen we ordered is not for main course since the portion is like 2 bites, with little broth inside. The meat and broth are not freshly made at all, it tasted like it sit in the fridge over a week then they reheated to serve us. The other Ramen we ordered, broth taste like plain soy sauce water... or water with few drops of soy sauce....
Server only focus on the bills and tips without decent service.
The owner is obviously over proud of his food and not friendly at all. 
I say with big mount of pride, owner need to improve everything in his restaurant and learn how to talk to customers in person, in stead of sending the server to protect his pride from poor food quality and quantity!
Worse experience so far and as zero it's not worth to rate at all. I will never come back and warn those who's bigger than 100lbs, bring your own snacks to fill your stomach since you pay 20 dollars but never will be full at 5S17. A total waste of such a golden location!"}
{"text":"Service here is so great. Loved the server and the food are awesome. Will come back again for their ramen. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"I tried 17S5 since it is one of the ramen places opening whole afternoon. I ordered Tonkotsu ramen and gyoza (Chinese dumplings). gyoza came quickly. Gyoza itself is decent, but sauce ruined the gyoza. It was too salty. I was waiting ramen coming but the cook didn't make any moves, just standing in kitchen. I asked him if he was going to make ramen. He replied and asked me if something wrong with gyoza. I told him I was going to have gyoza and ramen at the same time. He replied gyoza was appetizer and it was supposed to be finished before ramen. I told him it was not Japanese way. Gyoza is side dish, not appetizer. He replied to me \"we ain't Japanese\". I was shocked to hear that comment at Japanese restaurant. Then he started making ramen. The noodle was in a individual package of plastic bag. The soup was in kept in looks like food-warmer often used for catering. Usually, a big pot is found in ramen places, and they cook their signature soup in the big pot. So I don't know if 5S17 is making soup by themselves. Eventually, the ramen was served. Everything was disappointing. The noodle has strong smell of baking soda; the tonkotsu soup was bland and no taste. It was broth rather than soup. The roast pork was also tasteless and dry. I didn't see anything interesting in toppling of ramen. So their ramen was really like fast food, and I think it is expensive to spend money for passionless food."}
