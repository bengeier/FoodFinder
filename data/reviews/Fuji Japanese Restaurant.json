{"text":"I'm your average wonder bread from mid America, so admittedly the only experience with Asian cuisine I have encountered has only been with in the past few years. Saying this, I still must attest to the genuiness, warmth, and comfort in not only the service  but the food of this modest establishment. Unable to decide,  I ordered the biggest combo, and I finished every bite.  The tempura.... Amazing... Light and crisp with just the right amount of sinful grease, but for me the real cherry on this savory sundae was the beef teriyaki...tender beef and the perfect kiss of sweetness in the sauce.  Needless to say I finished my plate! These folks deserve all the praise they have received."}
{"text":"I have been to Fuji a few times now and I will be back many more.  The staff is always so attentive and awesome.  They offer the most authentic and delicious Japanese I've ever had and the prices cannot be beat.  The amount of food you get for the cost is unbelievable.
They are always offering some sort of discount if you \"like\" them on facebook.
If you haven't tried them yet, do yourself a favor and get over there.  You won't be sorry."}

{"text":"Just because you call yourself Fuji Steakhouse doesn't mean you're a Fuji Steakhouse!!!
Terrible experience!!Mediocre food and an outrageous bill with the gratuity added on with out our knowledge.  We came here with the intention of celebrating my daughters 10th birthday with her grandparents. A 45min drive. A total of 5 guests no bar drinks(only 2 bottles of beer ordered) and her grandparents SPLIT their meal, knowing about the $5 extra fee to share they wouldn't bring my mother a salad. Not one time did anyone have any fun never did they show any \"flare\" no Volcano onion flames, no toss the shrimp in our mouths, no sake bombs, or sake \"water\" shots for the kids, no toss the egg in the hat or ANY fancy handwork with the spatulas. No clanging or cheering no fun at all. Charged us $12 for noodles that's were never cooked. Shrimp overcooked, steak: small, overcooked, unseasoned. My parents split a 4oz lobster tail 5 scallops and 8 shrimp for $43.99 oh plus the $5 for sharing. Ridiculously overpriced. We had the steak and shrimp and when they brought us the bill.... $194.87. @!! $!%รท$ ARE YOU KIDDING ME FOR WHAT MY DAUGHTER WAS IN TEARS BY THE TIME WE LEFT. 

Never ever go here, unless you like a funeral atmosphere bad food terrible service and for an insane amount of money."}
{"text":"This was my first \"good\" find in Las Vegas, for Japanese food, over 14 years ago. It's family owned and operated, and the husband and wife are very very nice. In a nothing strip-mall on Pecos and Trop, the interior is well-worn but comfortable. Yes, enjoy those silk flowers on your table, but every once and awhile there WILL be real ones!

The food is simple, hearty and VERY tasty. They excell at tempura and their beef or chicken teriyaki are very good. A wonderful treat is their sukiyaki. The broth they make for it is both very sweet and savory at the same time. I've eaten here with my husband at least 50 times in all those years, and have never had a bad experience. I used to live on that side of town and went very often, once or twice a month. They have a teppanyaki grill, but i've never eaten any food from it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas!  Authentic Japanese food at very reasonable prices with a great mom-and-pop flair.  Not super fancy but a place you can get good food, relax, and the nicest servers in the world."}
{"text":"I came here with friends to see our friend's band play and we ended up in the hibachi table room instead of the room with the band.  So, we did not get to hear our friend play but the hibachi was decent.  It was better than what I've had at other local Japanese restaurants.  They had a good selection of proteins to choose from on the menu for hibachi.  I ordered steak and shark steak.  I have never seen shark stead on the menu before so that was exciting.  Other than that it was nothing superb but it was good.  We did also order a couple plates of sushi that were delicious."}
{"text":"Prompt service and entertaining chef, but that's it. The food is not that good. The salad dressing looks like mayo and the food is bland. Not impressed at all. The price is outrageous! Not going here again."}
{"text":"We've been going to Fuji for years and enjoy it quite a bit.  The food is wonderful, and the owners are really nice.  I particularly enjoy the calamari appetizers."}
{"text":"Small menu, but awesome tasting simple food. Friendly service. I had the Vegetable Tempura and it was just the right amount of food. Followed that with Mango Mochi, perfect for a summer day. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Polite staff, okay atmosphere. The food is not authentic but okay. I ordered the Chicken Yakisoba. I may try something different if I decided to go back."}
{"text":"Home-Made Authentic Japanese Cuisine served with a genuine smile and friendly conversation.  Not fusion.  Better. Way Better.

Only down-side is the area is a tad on the 'sketch' side for a visiting tourist.  But other than that,   'sake bomb' away!!"}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of hibachi restaurants - they're a bit corny, but fun once in awhile for a group of people. I was really, really disappointed though for a few reasons. 

Our group ordered the spicy chicken and vegetarian noodles. The food tasted okay, but largely because of the MASS amounts of garlic butter/oil being used. I get that this isn't where you go for a healthful meal, but there are limits, and they certainly reached them for me. Moreover, it was a bit of a turnoff when they explained that their dressing was just mayo and ginger. It may have tasted good, but mentally, the way it was described made it less than enjoyable.

A more specific problem our group had is we had one friend with us who was vegan. All of us had to explain that she wanted her food without butter, and just with veggie oil. We were told this was okay, but it was a consistent problem throughout the meal. So, be careful when you order the vegetarian dish there - you might not be too happy with the result if that's something you are looking for.

So - I'd think twice before making this your groups' destination. Although the only other restaurants nearby are chains, we all agreed we would have preferred going to one over going here."}
{"text":"Great Japanese teppanyaki at a great price!  If you are a snob and are looking for a hoity, toity place, this place is NOT for you.  If you want really good food at a really good price - look no further.  The restaurant is a bit run down, but the food is great.  Take a chance!  Service is great and food is great.  The atmosphere is lacking and the \"show\" is lacking, but I will overlook that for great food and service that is definitely affordable for my large family :-)"}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is amazing beyond all reason. Once you get past the aesthetics as has been mentioned in previous reviews, this place is simply divine. Amazing Japanese food at really, really good prices. 

Came in here around 8 PM since Red Velvet Cafe had some issues and were no longer serving food. My friend had not been here before, and it had been ages since I had so it was almost a new experience for us both. 

The service is A+. The server we had was extremely attentive, and we never had to ask for anything. There were a few other patrons there who were raving about the red bean ice cream (which was a part of my meal, hurrah) but mostly the place was empty, which is a shame, because the food is phenomenal. 

I ordered off-menu technically. I asked for a veggie plate hibachi-style, and edamame. This came with vegan fried rice (!!!), sprouts, onion, and zucchini on the biggest plate I've ever seen, and a salad with ginger dressing. The edamame was really good and everything came out steaming hot. I didn't think I would finish all of my food but lo and behold, I did. I ate about 7 fistfuls of vegetables in one sitting, plus ice cream. Wow. 

My friend ordered the teriyaki steak and some sushi, and he really enjoyed the steak so much that he had to slow himself down and enjoy it. 

Come here if you want ridiculously good food at very decent prices, with service that is hard to match at most other restaurants. I want to shout from the rooftops how great this little restaurant is because it really does deserve all the business in the world. Wonderful dining experience and I will definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch (sushi both times).  Each time the food was above average, and the staff is very friendly.  I will eat here again when I'm in Macedonia."}
{"text":"Tried Fuji for the first time this evening and it was good.  My table split 3 different sushi rolls, a couple shrimp Tempura apps and we all had ice cream.  The food was good but the service was a bit on the lacking side.  It took a while for waters to be refilled and there was not much ice in the waters.  A minor detail yes but on a really hot day like today it makes a difference.  Would go back and try again."}
{"text":"If you want a good udon soup for a good price, this is the place...delicious!!! It is a nice little restaurant with friendly people..food is fresh and delicious...I'll definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'd heard about this place before from my husband's cousin who raves about it. After going to Outback and finding out there was an hour wait, we went to Fuji and were seated immediately. The soup and salad were good.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken and my husband had the diablo chicken.  We both enjoyed our meals. The only thing keeping it from a 5-star was that they didn't bring out all the chicken to be cooked at the same time so everyone at the table, including my husband,  He had to go get more and I received my chicken probably 8 minutes after everyone else.  It was good, just delayed.  We will certainly return again."}
{"text":"Love love love Fuji! From the outside you wouldn't be too impressed (Trop and Pecos.. yuck) but the food is amazing, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is amazing. A must try!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. If you have the urge to throw away your money, just do it somewhere else.

I've been here 2 times. The first time was terrible but I thought I would give it another chance. Bad idea. The first time I went, I went during lunch for the hibachi and a sushi appetizer. When I walked in the establishment, a woman sat me immediately but did not bring me a menu. When the hibachi chef came around to ask what my order was, I had to request one and ended up having to make the entire table wait for me to look it over and decide. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and the chicken hibachi. Soup and salad comes with the hibachi meal and was the first thing to come out. These items were the only items that tasted decent. The chicken ended up being burnt but trying to communicate that with the chef and the server was difficult and there was clearly a language barrier. They said that's how chicken is cooked. So I was left with my burnt chicken. If you're expecting good portions of chicken, veggies, or rice... go ahead and get rid of that expectation. You won't get much. My sushi came after the hibachi and it was loosely wrapped, so fell apart when picking up with chop sticks. I had to eat it like a chipotle bowl with a fork. So disappointed. I left hungry and frustrated... but thought maybe this was just a fluke. I went again today for take out lunch. I didn't get hibachi this time, I got salad and soup (still okay) and I got a crunchy shrimp roll, spicy tuna roll, and cucumber roll. The cucumber was good. The spicy tuna and crunchy shrimp rolls were again rolled loosely and fell apart. I'm eating it out of a bowl with a fork at my desk at work - If I hadn't spent 30 minutes waiting on the food that I called ahead for, I would be going and getting a different lunch from somewhere else. 

Never wasting my money there again. Overpriced, poor quality, and slow as molasses."}
{"text":"Food was alright, nothing too special, took a while for the food to get prepped and my girl and I were the only ones in the restaurant lol the server was nice and the cook was polite, we tried their Eel roll and not quite fond of theirs, so much rice on it that the thing fell apart while trying to eat em, I guess this can be a good spot for just take out, nothing authentic about the food that's for sure."}
{"text":"After our fruitless Slider-venture, we somehow ended up coming here on a whim. 

This place is a small restaurant in an unassuming shopping center. At most it could probably hold about 40 small people, but don't let that stop you from sampling their goods. 

I found the restaurant charming. The menu is small and there are several versions scattered about the restaurant, including one posted in front of the door so you can see what they're offering as soon as you enter. You can order sushi, selecting nigiri by the piece or from a handful of cut rolls. There's also hibachi, with 2 grill tops available and two options to choose from (new york steak and 2 skewers of yakitori or the steak and 3 pieces of shrimp). You can have steamed rice or fried, and the meal came with a bowl of miso soup and a salad (garnished with sesame seeds at the table). The three of us opted for the hibachi meals, and our chef was a 72 year old oji-san who was very polite. He cooked up our food while talking with us about Japan, joking about golfing & skiing. The food was simple and clean, without the use of MSG or anything weird. As such, it wasn't particularly exciting but it was satisfying.  

After our meal, we were given a choice of ice cream flavors to choose from. I had red bean while the boys had plum.

They also have beer available!

I look forward to returning to try their sukiyaki and tonkatsu, as the food seems very cozy and homestyle. It's a nice little escape close to our home with yummy food at good prices."}
{"text":"We intended on going to Casa D'angelo and then a movie, but being New Year's Day, they were closed. In order to avoid going to a chain restaurant (which isn't easy in Macedonia) we decided to give Fuji a try. When we walked in, I saw there were only 4 people eating. Not a good sign. We were promptly greeted and seated by a very friendly woman. The place looked very clean but the decor had a definite 80's look to it. The menu is very, very small and is not the menu on Yelp. At all. At this point we were debating leaving. The prices were also outrageous. We ended up being happy we stayed though, because the food was very good. However, I can't recommend it because of the menu and the crazy high prices."}
{"text":"I'm just seconding everything that Lindsey said about this place.  It definitely ain't the fanciest digs around, but it's not the type of place you go for the ambiance.  You head to Fuji to get some excellent Japanese good at really good prices.

The staff - because the chef's come out to say hi before - are all very nice and attentive.  Once we were seated near their sound system - a boom box (see, not fancy) - and it was a little too loud and we asked if we could turn it down.  They said sure, apologized (although it wasn't anything to apologize about) and brought us a free roll which was way above and beyond what anyone would have expected.

Man, now I think I know what I'm going to eat tonight."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Hibachi places I have been to recently! Little slow on service, but you go for a hole in the wall not for speed."}
{"text":"Stay Away and seek out a better quality Japanese restaurant. Staff is friendly but Food is mediocre as well as pricey. 

I witnessed a lot of cross contamination, using bare hands with no gloves to handle food, no hair nets and owner seems to have negative views of his main customer base of African Americans however they are the main reason the business is staying afloat."}
{"text":"As someone who spent 5 years living in Japan this restaurant offends me to the core. I don't know where to even begin with this train wreck of a restaurant. I guess I'll start by saying that this restaurant does not serve Japanese food.  I know that when most people think of Japanese food they think of Sushi, Hibachi and instant ramen noodles. Well they definitely have Sushi in Japan but it is nothing like what you find in America, it is infinitely better and they most definitely invented instant ramen noodles(which can't shine a light on how awesome real ramen is). Hibachi restaurants are an unholy American creation and this place falls into that category and it is a bottom barrel Hibachi restaurant at best. Now on to the meal. I ordered chicken yakisoba; A delicious yet humble dish in Japan, yet the disgusting mess that I was prepared tonight was not yakisoba. As part of my order I was brought a salad made up of iceberg lettuce that was drowned in thousand island dressing. I would estimate that there was at least a half a cup of dressing on this poor little salad, next was a bowl of soup which was in reality just a bowl of beef broth with a few onions and mushrooms tossed in which was completely disgusting. Next in the course was \"Hibachi\" stir fried vegetables which consisted of onions, mushrooms and zucchini drowned in vegetable oil and copious amounts of butter, stir fried. Another complete failure and the last course was the yakisoba, which again consisted of cabbage and other unidentifiable vegetables drowned in oil, butter, soy sauce and some kind of butter with soba noodles tossed on top. This entire meal was utterly devoid of flavor other than that of the oil that everything was swimming in. I almost forgot to mention that they used the same knife for the fish, chicken, shrimp and vegetables on the grill. I am not a chef  nor a professional cook but I know that you should never ever do this to avoid cross contamination especially with raw chicken and seafood. Please stay away from this restaurant and do yourself a favor by finding an authentic Japanese restaurant. This was quite possibly one of the worst meals I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"I'm really stuck on this one.

The food was good, but very expensive. ($110 for a family of four, with only two drinks ordered: beer & wine). I've visited other hibachi restaurants, received better food, better service and paid 1/4 less.

They had one of the best soups ever, but charged extra for fried rice, even with hibachi!  I've never heard of that.

The hibachi was entertaining, but we've experienced better.

Exterior of the restaurant is odd because they block off the view out the windows with some crazy print screen scenic photo.  The interior looks worn, the hibachi grill could use a thorough cleaning.  If it weren't for the decent food this place would be a total kitchen nightmare.

The staff were a little shaken the night we visited as a party seated before us was trying to complain about everything and get a teriyaki chicken removed from the bill because they suddenly realized midway through the meal they don't like teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"Not great. No showmanship, fire, spatula flipping, etc. Lunch vegetables are different than dinner --pureed carrots and onions. Sesame chicken is only grilled chicken with seeds on top....No taste!"}
{"text":"I love Fuji.  I have been coming to this place for as long as I can remember because it has been my entire life.  Since it is one of my grandfather's favorite places, I have been sat in a highchair at Fuji as well as celebrated my college graduation with friends and family.  The menu is simple, but the food is always solid.  The service is friendly and not as slow as some other reviews suggest.  And the food is totally authentic home-style Japanese.  It reminds me of my grandmother's food - a memory that  has not been invoked by any other Japanese restaurant.

Consistent and delicious, you can count on Fuji to fulfill a Japanese craving."}
{"text":"Great little Japanese restaurant. Food is good and the prices are reasonable. If you are looking to impress a date or a business partner, this probably isn't a good choice. But if you want some good teppanyaki and don't want to break the bank, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"We originally went in there for hibachi, because it was something we were comfortable eating. Their grill was down so we decided to try some new food and it was AWESOME! Great experience friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch & ordered the steak & shrimp hibachi for $12.90. The steak was not high quality, very basic, but everything else was good. The ginger sauce was good as well. The waitress and cook were friendly."}
{"text":"Hibachi - Japanese for overpriced but fun show.  

Cons - Seating in this place is a bit cramped.  The setup also makes it loud, and the exhaust fans don't work well.

Pros - My sushi was good.  My accompaniment had a variety of items they let me try also.  The steak and chicken were great.  I recommend  dipping both into \"McDonalds\" sauce (Thousand Island with no relish).

Nice chef too.  He called me Sushi man since all I had was sushi.  To which I responded, I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob.  He also did not laugh.

If you have an hour for lunch, this might be pushing it.  It's a good time though.  Keep it in mind for dinner."}
{"text":"It alright not much but it foods. Good beer but it needs to be chilled not cold."}
{"text":"Dreadful. The chefs aren't Japanese and it shows - no \"show\" at all. Then the whole service aspect was terrible! They offered chicken liver appetizers - but when I went to school the appetizers came first. Not here! Everything comes in totally random order. Appetizer after the entree and finally followed by rice - WHat the ???? My wives salmon was undercooked. If you want Japanese green tea you have to ask for it. I asked for it twice. Never got it. For the Fuji - forget it!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't bother

I used to really like this restaurant. I haven't been here for many years. Went for dinner tonight and we will never go again. 

No show from the cook. I ordered spicy chicken and he forgot the spices so I had dry chewy chicken. 

We had to pay extra for fried rice and it was mediocre at best. 

If you want a fun great hibachi experience, go to Wasabi or one of the other places. This is NOT impressive and NOT worth the crazy prices."}
{"text":"Ok. I really wanted to have a good eating experience at Fuji. I was trying to avoid the all you can eat Japanese in Vegas. And I tried to to go to a family owned place. There has been serious vote stuffing here. Or food deprived reviewers. 

So I read the Yelp reviews and 4 and a half stars...I drive there on a Monday...duh, closed. So, we go back tonight- Tuesday. Walk in and the place looks dumpy and stinks of hibachi in the middle of the room (my clothes still reek of it as I write this.) 

If you're not used to really good Japanese, you probably would not know the difference. But, folks this isn't the place. The waitress took 10 minutes to get to us, another 10 to bring the miso soup, after I asked again. Then, we had the entree come but, the sushi was missing. When it came after I asked for it, the salmon (sake) and unagi sushi tasted like it came out of a freezer. The decor is just sad. The chairs in the waiting area are all seriously stained. The bathrooms are dirty. Small things like this are clues to the experience you're about to have if you look for them. Usually, the Japanese are extremely clean and orderly. 

If this is Las Vegas good Japanese, save yourself the hassle and go to In-N-Out Burger. 

In short, I think what happened here is a lack of pride in the food they serve and a white bread customer base that think Benihana's was the pinnacle of Japanese culinary expression. I've been to at least 40-50 Japanese restaurants all over the country. So, I know when it comes out right. 

On the plus side, plenty of parking at the strip mall."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the Hibachi other than the small serving and the tub of butter that cost $20+ per dish."}
{"text":"Had a great time Fugis!!! The staff was great, very friendly and the food was amazing, I would recommend this place to anybody! If you have a baby this place is for you! Even though they didnt have alot of variety of sushi, their habachi was the best! Yum Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here well over a dozen times in the past 10 years. I guess I am a creature of habit, at least when it comes to Fuji. I always get the Steak & Chicken hibachi combo and it is always delicious! Best to go before 6:30 as you can get the Early Bird special of the combo for $7.00 less than regular price. Service is friendly and we love the salad dressing on the cold, crisp salads."}
{"text":"Overall: I did not have a good experience with sushi take out.  I probably won' be back.

Service: 2 stars.  I Googled their menu and reviewed it online.  It showed a lot of great sushi choices.  When I called for take-out, the lady told me that was not the correct menu and they don't know how to remove it from the site. Since I was obviously not the first person to make that mistake, they should find a way to fix the online menu.

Food: 2 stars.  Sushi was average.  The selection was weak.

Price: 2 stars.  I requested extra spicy sauce on the side, for my 2 rolls.  Most sushi places give this away for free, or charge $0.50 or $1.00.  They told me it would be $2.50, which I told them was fairly high.  When I arrived, I found out it was $2.50 per roll ($5.00 total) for a little extra spicy sauce on top of the 2 rolls.  I said that was crazy, and they reduced it to $3.00, which I reluctantly paid.

Interior Appearance: 2 stars.  It has about 10 large hibachi tables.  It's dark and open with some blue lights around the side."}
{"text":"I will never eat here ever again. The customer service and food was horrible. My sister and I ate here 3 days ago. We had to wait forever for our salads and soup. We order the Calamari Tempura that came out not cooked. We sent it back and they refried what we sent back and said we don't want it. They still charged me for the Calamari even though we didn't eat it. This is the worse from the customer service to the food."}
{"text":"I have gone here several times and would recommend you to try it.

1.  Homey - Not fancy and definitely family run. Kinda basic, but not bad.

2.  Food - Pretty good, I eat Japanese food all over the world and even in Japan. It is authentic stuff, basic home style cooking, not your fancy Americanized Sushi Rolls that are so mixed up you really cannot taste the true flavors.

3.  Service - Did I say family run?  Seems like a small family runs it. Not entirely efficient, but certainly not too bad. Just be prepared to wait a bit.

4.  Food Selection - Pretty basic, the stuff here is not going to challenge your taste buds or your sensibilities. Serving size....okay.

5.  Price - Very Economical.

I don't mind this place, and would come back, but I also have other places I would pick first. I give it a 3.5"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. The staff was very nice and they treated my son like a prince for his birthday. The shrimp was amazing, and for the price ($18.95) it was the best hibachi grill I've been to in town off the strip.  The owners are always there and make you feel like family.  The whole staff is very attentive, weather the place is full, or we are the only ones in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ah, Fuji. I love I love I love this place. Great Japanese food, friendly service, and good prices. The best I've found in Las Vegas, actually. I'll be totally up front about the aesthetics, though -- the place could use some work. Dingy fluorescent lighting, faded plastic flowers on every table top, cheap flooring, and let's just say that thin little mat in each seat at the booths is there for looks more than anything. I find myself shifting from cheek to cheek throughout meal, to avoid numbness. All that aside, I am a repeat customer to Fuji. My friend and I dined there for the first time about a week ago. I enjoyed Combination A, which consists of miso soup or a fresh green salad tossed with ginger dressing (which they offer in a 16 oz take-home container for $4.95), two entrees, rice, and ice cream for dessert., all for $10.50. And it was worth every penny. Initially, I thought, \"Well, I'll order this, eat half, and save the rest for a nice lunch tomorrow.\" Nope. Didn't happen. There was nothing left to take home. Luckily, my friend shared the green tea ice cream, which was EXCELLENT, with me, or I would have popped.

The second time we ate at Fuji, which was this weekend, my friend's mom was in town, and we just had to share our new find with her. I ordered tea and miso soup for myself, and shared a rainbow roll ($14.50, but gigantic) and nabeyaki udon with the table. My friend ordered  two pieces of salmon nigiri for herself, priced at $1.30 each. Like I said, the prices are just right for me. And the food is really, really good. The menu is a little limited, but everything we've ordered from it has been fantastic. The server, Mo -- I'm pretty sure she's the only server they have -- is very friendly and eager to share her knowledge and preferences with you.

Yum. ,': )"}
{"text":"NO SHOW!! 

This is the best Habachi I have been to.
The food was great and the fact that the focus was on the food and not the egg tricks made it even better.

Lunch time is not busy and the staff is very tentative....."}
{"text":"Ok food but not worth the money.  Strange atmosphere, no flair in the habachi which is one of the draws to that type of restaurant. I even tried to talk the guy up politely but he just ignored me.  And not because there was a language barrier as he was clearly American.  I will not be returning but since it was just us in the place I think others feel the same way."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Food was cooked to perfection.The chef had good showmanship. The prices were fair considering they were cheaper than wasbi, another habchi restaurant in Cleveland. I will be back for me and my girlfriends anniversary."}
{"text":"There was a strand of hair in my soup and when I showed the lady she said it was from the mushroom....no it's not lady I know what hair looks like. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Wow im surprised by all the low stars....I came here on a visit with my fam who come here quite often. The staff remembered them and also couldn't be more friendly...everyone from the chef to the host.

The food (and prices) was just as good as any other restaurant of the type and just as flavorful. Its not the biggest place on the inside but since it wasn't by any means packed for lunch it suited us just fine. Our chef wasn't one for as much flair as some of the other chefs but he had a good convo going and the food was good so I was happy with it. 

They have lunch and dinner specials as well with different combos to suit the palate and really can't go wrong with either one. I will def be back when i'm around the area.

ps. go to town on the sauces and also ask for the diablo sauce as well. (I think that was what it was called...its there hotter sauce. Yum.)"}
{"text":"After doing a Yelp search for a 'real' sounding Japanese place, the reviews here seemed like it was a sure thing...and thanks fellow yelpers you didn't steer us wrong at all.  Spent almost 8 years in Japan and the 'ambiance' made this place really seem like when we opened the doors we were stepping into a restaurant in Japan.  The grills are still broken, and from seeing the previous reviews it seems to have been broken for quite sometime, they had a TV sitting on top when we were there..so I wonder if they're going to fix them.  I wonder if they get enough constant business to justify the repair.  Well I hope so, because with as good as my steak was cooked in the back like it would have been in front of us, there's something to be said for dinner and a show.  I don't need onion volcano's or to watch them throw a potato in their hat, i just enjoy watching them chop, dice and cook my meal as well as the casual conversation.
When we walked in there was a few tables put together where a large group of Japanese people were enjoying their meals as well as a couple bottles of sake, laughing and having a good time.  When we walked in they stopped looked at us briefly and went back about their business (first thing that made me feel like I was back in Japan).  As we continued to walk in mamma-San appeared from the back and told us to have a seat and handed us a couple of menus.  (she was cute and sweet, #2 thing...you see a pattern yet?) The booth we sat in the 2nd to last along the wall the table and seat were to close on one side and almost to much on the other but hey who needs a reminder they shouldn't eat everything on the menu!
We ordered our meals, they came out quickly and perfectly cooked.  We both devoured dang near everything on our plate, but it was just the right amount.  As we were finishing our dinner and she was insisting we could find room for dessert an older couple came in and walked to the booth behind us like they'd been there a thousand time.  When the sweet mamma-San appeared she started almost squealing and was obviously happy to see them.  I'm an avid people watcher/eavesdropper in public :) and easily hear what I could imagine as my grandparents talking to an old friend and they had been craving all their favorites and had decided that they would order them all and take home the leftovers.  The proof is in the return customers and people who crave something you serve.  
All in all I really enjoyed this place, hope that at some point they repair the grill.  I will be back probably many times.  I think i forgot to mention it was about $50 for two people to have full meals, good home cooked like meals...that's crazy cheap and another reason I'll be back and encouraging others to go to."}
{"text":"When my mom was visiting a few weeks ago, she wanted to go to a Japanese restaurant for dinner. It was a Sunday night, so we needed to find something that was open. Fuji Restaurant is close to where I live so we decided to go there. 
It's a small restaurant, very cozy. There were a few other people there when we went in, but it wasn't busy. The service was excellent. We didn't have to wait very long after we sat down to have someone take our order. 
The price of the meal included edamame and miso soup and both were very yummy. I ordered the katsudon and it was the perfect serving size and cooked perfectly. The prices were extremely reasonable for the amount and quality of the food. 
My mom liked it so much that for dinner the night before she left, we returned to eat there again. And she already has plans to go back when she comes to visit again. I would definitely recommend this place to others."}
