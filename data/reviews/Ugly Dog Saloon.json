{"text":"Great wings, awesome specials, a lively staff, cool atmosphere, trivia nights. I could probably keep going on and on but I'll spare you reading a big review. Come here."}
{"text":"We (me and my girlfreind) have been going here for wings since they were 15 cents on Thursdays.  Up in till last week i had no problem with anything there, they raised the wing prices, fine, i know wings are getting expensive.  And there are a couple cheaper places to go, but i really liked them there.  But last last week was the last time i'll go there.  We sit down to order and the girl says for teh first time ever \"you can only order wings in 10's now and you cant order any to-go\".  I thought that's fine we usually split 3 kinds anyway. so we order 30 to split, they were very good as always. But we could only finish 25 of the 30.  So i ask the bartender if i can get a  small box for the wings i didn't finish, she say \"No, no carry out\". so i ask \"what are you going to do with them just throw them away?\"  she says \"yep\". So the wings i l already paid for and couldn't get in orders of 5 i had to throw away? That's ridiculous!!! I can understand if i was taking home 10 or more, but 5? give me a break!"}
{"text":"I had to change my review recently. Much of the \"staff\" we have come to love has left. If your one for mixed drinks- one might choose differently. The bartenders are hit and miss. Hopefully management will get a handle on that and fix that issue soon."}
{"text":"I have never been treated so poorly by an establishment.  I was with three friends, who recieved their food an hour before I did.  When the waitress finally returned with my wings, I told her that I was upset.  She said if I refused to pay for them that she couldn't let me eat them and that I had to leave and never come back.  I asked to speak to a manager, who told me that it was busy, too bad! I have only complained at 1 other establishment in my life.  Needless to say, I will never be back- because I'm not allowed!  

Can't testify on the wings since they were taken from me before I had a chance to enjoy a meal with friends."}
{"text":"Saturday at 11:30 am, those wings in a tray of one of their many flavors were super good.  Honey garlic bbq sauce, a beverage, and a chill mid-day atmosphere make this place a serious hit for lunch."}
{"text":"Their pizza is really good! I ordered two slices and they filled me up. Each is a pretty decent size. I also ordered cheese fries. Personally, I don't like the kind that have crispies on the outside, but they were still good.

The only complaint I have is the food took a long time to come out. Two of us went in for a quick dinner around 5 on a week day, and we were the only people sitting down at a table. The bar area was also a lot less than half filled so I don't see how it took 40 minutes for four slices of pizza and a basket of French fries.

You are not allowed through the door even for food unless you are over 21 years of age so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"For my first experience at this place, a three is a fair rating since I am only able to review the service, atmosphere and prices. 

The service was pleasant and attentive considering there wasn't much of a crowd to  compete with. But, it was early in the night and it seemed to be a place to go later in the night. 

The only thing that left me scratching my head was that I had originally heard about the Ugly Dog from a friend raving about their food. And while we didn't order any food (see below as to why) I can't understand how a place known more for its food can still have patrons smoking inside? 

I generally don't mind the smell of cigarettes in an open-air setting but in a closed bar with no fan movement, it leaves the smoke lingering around my face. I considered ordering food but couldn't get past the idea of my food ending up tasting like the thick smoke of the bar. 

Maybe there needs to be a compromise of smoking inside after as certain time to allow for a dinner/food crowd to enjoy the food without being subject to secondhand smoke clouding their food. 

Overall, I will likely be returning - hopefully to  order food."}
{"text":"I had not been to this place for awhile and decided to give it a try with a group of people going to check out a band this previous Wednesday. The bar was busy and the bartender, a blonde girl named Jessica I believe was working. She seemed very irritated to have to serve people. She was very rude and would be talking to friends I'm guessing for long periods of time. I was never treated this poorly at any bar or restaurant ever. There are other bars that will be happy to take our money. Never again would I go there!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Monday during the day. Amanda the bartender was awesome during my visit. Very quick, good personality and really cares about the bar. I had wings, they were fantastic. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great wings and pretty cheap drinks. They have 4 dart boards and 2 pool tables as well. Really good dive bar with a decent crowd."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years with my softball team. Great place, friendly bartenders, very good food. Always treated well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was in town and didn't wanna drive to the Carson strip. Found this place thanks to the girl at the front desk of our hotel. Top shelf liquer was super cheap, no cover and people were friendly and made us feel like we were regulars. Girls were receptive. Talked to everyone and they bought us shots. We did have an issue with one girl who was yelling at us, but the bouncer was cool and told them to shut up and invited us back for the next day!  It's a little local joint with big time potential. If they read this; Thanks for your hospitality and showing us Jersey Boys a good time. Oh yeah, and thanks to the girls who drove us home since the cab service in town sucks."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of this place because their wings aren't bad. I put up with the atrocious service and dingy smoke infested seating because I liked their wings. I've worked in the service industry for years and the service here is not only non existent when you need it, but they are downright out of line and racist to be honest. I walked in there on Thursday night with a (black) friend who had just moved into town, who had never been there before. After sitting there for 15 mins waiting for someone to greet us we were finally greeted by their bouncer coming over and telling us that my friend stole wings from there before and we needed to leave. Kind of hard to do for someone who had never been there before. No problem here, I spend a lot of money at these kinds of places, but I will never be back there."}
{"text":"Good place to go after work for a few and meet up with friends.  Cheap drinks, and on Fridays there is free food, usually something half way decent, and the wings here are very good."}
{"text":"Ugly Dog has some AMAZING wings. I will say that Hot Garlic, and Chipotle Gold are my go-to wing sauces on a Thursday night. 

The only times I've ever been to Ugly Dog were for their awesome Thursday Night Special on wings which are 25 cents a piece. So you can go to Ugly Dog and order as many wings as your little heart desires and get a few beers and get weird.

Believe me, I live for getting weird (drunk) and eating wings, and Ugly Dog Saloon supplies that to my much needed lifestyle."}
{"text":"So many wing flavors! If you like wings and you like to try different flavors this is your place. There are a ton of flavors to try. Nice size bar and lots of beers on tap!"}
{"text":"Pretty good local bar. Good prices, $7 for a domestic beer and vodka & sprite on a weekend night. Good music from the DJ, some mixes were a little strange. But, overall fun environment. The place is much bigger than I imagined. Very good first impression!"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch once a week with a few co workers. It is usually on Monday or Wednesday. Monday is $6 burger day, and Wednesday is $5 anything for lunch day. The bartenders are awesome. We always get their burgers and they are great. Very consistent. For the price, this place is great. I usually just get water, but their bar is very large with many different liquors and lots of beers on tap. They have a lunch card where you get your 10th lunch for free."}
{"text":"Von 11/17/2013
The wings are good. Many selections. A large array of beer choices. The barmaid was very friendly and helpful. The customers were friendly as well. Prices were fair. One draw back, this is not a clean place. Terrible bathrooms and the kitchen, which you can view does not inspire an appetite. But the wings were tasty."}
{"text":"I was shocked to actually enjoy myself at the Ugly Dog.  I was told to expect something completely unlike what I ended up experiencing as it was described to me as a hole in the wall dump that was filthy.  Minus the smokieness, and the fact it was totally packed, I had a great time and cannot say anything bad about it!  

I did not have food, just some beers, and got to enjoy some awesome people watching, sports on TV and good music brought to us by the DJ... some older school goodies too!"}
{"text":"Update: We stopped in for wing night last night. You could order them 6 per flavor in the past. Last night, we found out that we had to order them by 10's. Man i loved ordering them 6 per flavor :\ Its still not a big deal though. 

Our drinks were strong and the bartender was ok. 

Our wings and fries took 35+ minutes. I understand it was wing night, but i've been there during a more crowded thursday and still got wings in less than 15 minutes. 

...Still an awesome deal and great flavors. Last night we ordered Garlic Parm, Honey Garlic BBQ (!!!!!!), Lemon Pepper & Caribbean BBQ (too sweet for me). The fries seemed beer battered and were delicious!

Can i ask though... why is smoking allowed where food is cooked and served. That's a little confusing......"}
{"text":"I've lived 2 blocks from here for 5 years, and I wish I could love this place, but at the end of the day it remains average. Good food, decent beer. Very smoky inside, and a few of the bartenders are borderline rude, and it takes a lot to make me feel offended. All in all, I'll continue to come here occasionally, because of the proximity. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to check this place out."}
{"text":"I have been to this place on more than one occasion and let me just say, each time has been great. The food & drinks are reasonably priced and if it's a game-day, there are always drink specials. I find the waitstaff are nice to you if you are nice to them. (Which is really any place you go unless they are automatic as*holes)

This past Sunday I attended a comedy show they hosted, which was hilarious and quite entertaining. Of course while I was there I ordered their hot wings with ranch/celery and a couple nice cold drafts to wash it all down. So good every time! The wings aren't super \"hot\" (as in spicy) but just have that perfect \"kick\" to keep you drooling for more. I tried my friends' wings, but I can't seem to remember all the different kinds we ordered. (Besides my hot) I'll find out & update. I do have to add one *special note* that the one bartender was running all over timbuktu getting our food/drinks, while still tending to the bar. She did a wonderful job and was really nice about us ordering more wings...some time later. Ha! 

You may be wondering after reading this review (Thanks btw) why I didn't give it 5 stars...and that is only because this establishment allows smoking. Now, I will have one every so often so I'm not trying to be a hypocrite, however, I don't care to inhale nor smell smoke while I'm trying to eat. I found the best choice is to sit in the dining area (To the right as you walk in) where not as many smoking fellas venture.

I highly recommend visiting on Sundays when it's 30 cent wings (Increments of 5 wings per your choice of wing sauce)."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always go here with my friends like 3 times per week to chill at the bar or play pool. Awesome atmosphere. But today is the second time when I have bad experience. Here is one bartender, a tall guy without any smile, oh gosh.... So first time we came when he was working it took him 20 mins to give us beer, plus it wasn't busy at all. Like 10 people inside. And only for us he gave beers in plastic cups. Everybody else had glass. Today is the same. I understand today is kinda busy but after 15 mins he asked what we want to drink, but.... After he served 10 more people . Finally we got our beer, again in plastic. So I asked him to pour  it a glass. He looked at me like what the hell, and then said its the same size. I was like I prefer a glass please because beer in plastic doesn't taste the same. He finally gave us beer in glasses and turned around pissed off. And trust me, we always tip like 40%, this guy doesn't deserve even a penny or working here. Love this place but this guy makes me just don't come here when he works. I hope the management gonna read my review and work on it."}
{"text":"One night I was on the other side of town, a long way from home, and had an hour to kill before an appointment. I walked into The Ugly Dog Saloon because I saw it and liked the name. The parking lot was crowded, so I figured, \"popular place.\" All of the tables were filled, and I managed to find one empty seat at the bar. They had a nice selection of beers on their taps, so I ordered one of my favorite IPAs and some buffalo wings and fries from a very pretty lady at the bar. I was shocked at how fast they came out of the kitchen. I figured I'd be waiting a long time for my food because of how crowded the place was, but in under five minutes I had a plate full of hot and crispy wings, and some exceptionally crispy fries. They were those batter coated fries, and I ate every last one of them. I tried another microbrew that I hadn't ever had before and asked for my check from a very polite, and very tall, young man working behind the bar. I was stunned at how low my bill was, but I had come during one of their wing night specials. I left an extra large tip, and decided that this was the kind of place that I'd like to come back to. The next time I visited, it was with a friend, and it was \"a hockey night in Pittsburgh.\" The place was once again packed, and we had to stand for a little while before somebody left and we got a seat. Once again, the bartenders took care of us right away, and the food came out super quick, and the wings were delicious. I've only been to this place three times, and every time I've had a good experience. It can be a little on the loud side in there, but that's because there are lots of people in the room, and it's a large room. Maybe next time I'll try something else besides the wings, but I must say that their wings and fries are excellent, and the tap selection is great!"}
{"text":"The place is alright, it's average bar and has relatively average bar food...even at that standard.  It gets an alright happy hour crowd, or an alright place to grab a sandwich and some wings.

I have a fair amount of memories when I first moved to Pittsburgh.   They used to have free chicken wings with the purchase of a drink so you could go and have wings and a few drinks cheap.   They no longer do this because I can't imagine that they made money on it."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to watch the Pens Game here...WOW...We are fans! Ugly Dog Saloon had a huge Projector Screen right in the middle of the Bar for all the action up close and the food was GREAT!

The WINGS were Excellent for the Price...CHEAP!

We also ordered the 'Big Ugly'...it is a CHEESE STEAK sandwhich with a Bacon Cheeseburger Stuffed inside. Let me Repeat...Steak, Burger, Bacon, Nacho Cheese, White Cheese, Mushroom, Onions all STUFFED into a 12\" Roll...for your enjoyment. The sandwhich was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss here. This time the blue cheese was like water, I've never seen so much breading on wings in my entire wing eating life, the service was slow but they only had one bartender one so it wasn't her fault. (It's a wrap around bar). The Mac and cheese bites were good. The wings were also cold. Big disappointment on the wings. Used to come here all the time and no consistency.
Update; the bartender confirmed the wings are from restaurant depot."}
{"text":"Well, the Wings are different, thats for sure. They use a dry seasoning on top, which I wasn't so sure about at first, but ended up loving them. They have a few pool tables and the music is top40ish from rap top40 (-1) to alt top40. I don't go out of my way to go there except Wing Night and sometimes Fridays to meet some friends that are regulars."}
{"text":"I have been to the ugly dog multiple times. It is our go to bar after work and is usually amazing. Mike and Ellie make the service and entertainment  awesome. But everyone once and a while we will get a server named Amanda ? Tall blonde. That literally has no personality but on top of that she has yet to not mess up a night while we are there. Whether it's that she can't provide us with what we want to drink (which only seems to be when she's working ) or if it's totally messing up a simple food order. To be honest I've never had a day when she was working that anything went smoothly for me or for anyone I was with. I love the ugly dog everyone there is great with the exception of the tall blonde that looks miserable and barely does her job. Sorry for being blunt but it's more than annoying. I'm in food and beverage and something needs to be resolved. Sad that I even needed to post a star"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid.   I love it.  It's friendly.  Food is decent.  Drinks are good.  It's a bar serving bar food but a great place for the local bar feel.   Employees are fun. Food is good drinks are good and prices are great!"}
{"text":"Are specials of the week are awesome from $1 blue moon Mondays to $3 bloody Mary Saturdays..4 free tacos on Tuesday and wing night Thursday we have an amazing bar crew jukebox is always jamming stop down any day or night for a drink or something good to eat..leave a comment on our website about your experience at the ugly dog.."}
