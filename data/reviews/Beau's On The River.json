{"text":"We went there for breakfast one morning, after making a reservation online at 10:45 only to find out the breakfast closes at 11 AM. Lady at front desk \"claimed\" to have tried to call us but said our number was disconnected--which it is not. Very unprofessional and disappointing on all ends as we were planning a birthday brunch. Should not be an option to book online at this time if you would only get 15 minutes. Disappointment doesn't begin to describe how we felt. Unfortunately we had to leave"}
{"text":"My daughter and I recently visited Beau's on the River and had a good experience.  The chicken salad sandwiches we both ordered were just average.  They would have been much tastier on a croissant than bread.  The cole slaw was delicious, as was the iced tea.  The restaurant itself was beautiful and the view was spectacular!  I used the Groupon, which was a good deal.  It was nice to receive a buy one-get one coupon for the Monday-Friday lunch buffet for a future visit by the end of the year.  We do plan to come back!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of people.  The staff was very friendly and the place looks very nice.  The appetizers took 30 minutes to come out after being told it would be no more than 15 minutes.  We had some shrimp, calamari, and spring rolls, which were actually pretty good.  However, the main entrees took quite a bit to come out as well and were not impressive.  Many people who ordered things like filet mignon thought their food was dry, bland, and was not cooked as they asked.  Because it took so long to actually get the food, they did not have the time to send it back.  Not only that, but some of the orders were messed up a bit as well.  The average prices are around $25-30 (I think around 30 for the filet mignon); it was definitely not worth the price.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Beaus for the first time a few days ago for my birthday.  We have been frequenting the same two restaurants(Lannings and Pomeroy House) for our birthdays for the past few years.  While we have never been disappointed in those establishments, we decided to branch out and try something new.  Overall, it was a mediocre experience.  It was practically empty when we got there at 6:30pm, and we got a nice window seat.  The view was great, but the constant draft was not.  I ordered the chicken parmesan and my husband got the filet.  We also ordered mozzarella sticks, at the suggestion of our waiter.  They ended up being pretty unique, but I felt like they were greasy.  I could only eat two of them.  My chicken parm was bland.  There was spinach on it that was very overpowering.  The sauce on the noodles was watery.  However, the portion size was generous for both.  My husband enjoyed his steak.  I took a bite of his mashed potatoes, and those were very tasty.  We ordered the chocolate lava cake to go, and that ended up being okay.  The ice cream that came with it didn't have much flavor to it though.  I still haven't made up my mind on if I liked our waiter or not.  I usually don't like servers who are constantly checking in and overly friendly, but I feel like ours was the opposite.  Almost bored.  He didn't really engage in any conversation and was more and more absent as the meal went on.  But, he did his job so can't complain too much about that.  I guess for the price, I was just expecting more from the experience.  We will be returning to our usual spots for special occasions from now on."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Beaus , and we went for the breakfast buffet since we had a Groupon. The food was ok. We were seated quickly. Waiter was nice and prompt. However, they don't tell you that with the buffet the drinks are extra. So-- as they come around and smile in your faces with the big carafe of OJ and coffee-- just remember that's an extra $6-7 or so. The buffet was ok. It was mainly your regular breakfast fare. The potatoes were cold. Waffle was probably mixed with water and not milk. No substance to it. Eggs were fair. Sausages were our fav. However being there for an hour I asked if I could order an omelette and if I cldnt finish it-- wld I be able to take it home?? The waiter said no. So after paying a total of $53 including the groupon, I had 2 bites of waffle, some eggs and sausages --- cold potatoes and 2 glasses of OJ (after the 2nd glass they aren't as prompt) and some cantaloupe. I tipped well. But we probably won't be back. I think Beaus is \"trying \" to be upscale here in the Falls, which is comical. But needs to be thorough and follow through on some things. Paying $14++ for a buffet and getting the same quality of food that you can typically get at a Bob Evans is sad. Nice try Beaus. We weren't impressed."}
{"text":"The view was awesome... The food was less than impressive. Service wasn't very good. Overall not what we had hoped it would be."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a special occasion.  Food [B-] Having already perused the reviews, I did not come in with any expectations for the food itself. That being said, we were craving seafood and ended up ordering a ocean-themed set of plates. Starting off, the tuna tartare had interesting components, yet lacked the cohesiveness and integration expected for a tartare dish. The tuna pieces were haphazardly arranged, and were not flavored with any sort of marinade, as if thrown on as an afterthought. As for entrees, the sea scallops were of reasonable size and cooked OK, lacking the firm bounce, whether due to lack of freshness or the amount of heat employed by the chefs. I tend to stay away from \"specials,\" yet this time the swordfish seemed so much more promising than the rest of the items on the menu. Unfortunately, the swordfish was a tad overcooked, which was a shame considering the inherent flavor potential. Rounding off the marine experience, a chocolate cake served a la mode with pistachio ice cream, which was just fine. Was the food terrible? Not at all, however, for the price point and the value of food you do receive, just accept that you are paying essentially a \"cover charge\" for the view and it'll make the experience more enjoyable.  Service [A-] Our waiter was pleasant, attentive, flexible, and did not push any items, which is always appreciated. We asked for specific substitutions, without any issues. Water and bread refilled in a timely manner.  Ambiance [A+] Perhaps it was the company I was with, or just the glistening of the water as it flowed into that autumn night, that made the occasion more enjoyable. The views here are outstanding. Our waiter was kind enough to place us in prime seats to get a full view of the river and the falls under the night lights. Being part of the Sheraton doesn't detract from the environment, and if anything it adds a little bit of pizzazz. Comfortable seating, well-spaced out from other tables and ample walkways make you feel overall very cozy. Dressing up is optional, as there will be hotel guests who will stroll in with more casual attire, while those on romantic adventures will often dress to the nines.  In summary, come here for the views. I would say for the price, the dining experience itself was 3.5 stars, so I'm rounding up for the excellent ambiance. Stay for the views. For a hotel restaurant in Cuyahoga Falls, it was a nice dining experience for the right occasion."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here last week. We grabbed dinner here before we went to downtown Akron to see a play. While we asked for a view of the river (they did give it to us), it was sadly not able to be seen because it was dark and raining out. (I hope to go back in the summer/daylight hours for a better view). Our service was a little shaky at first, but then the server really came around and was super friendly by the end of the meal. We all ordered the small plates for dinner, which had plenty enough food. I got the salmon, and it was so delicious. The sauce and risotto that accompanied it - both amazing. Just the right amount of food too, and much easier on the pocketbook. I also got the soup of the day, which was perfect for the cold damp night. I can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu"}
{"text":"First off let me say I have been to the other Beau's in Fairlawn and they are great, I wish I could say the same for here. Three of us had lunch there the other day my ice tea was the worst could not even drink it never had that happen anywhere before. I had the calamari which was over cooked and like rubber not to mention the sauce it was cooked in was not good. I had my other guests try it  and they hated it too so it just wasn't me. I then had the caesar salad pretty safe bet right? No sad to say they had whole anchovies all over it totally over powered it. I have had this all over the country never had it with whole anchovies before. My other guests had similar complaints with their food. $50.00 for lunch that was the terrible left most of it on the plates. Our waitress was very nice I didn't complain because what do you say it was all so bad and it wasn't her fault."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice.  For the price paid, was very disappointed both times.  Service was \"ok\", but not great.  The most recent time was New Year's Eve.  My group of 6 was seated right at 6PM (time of our reservations).  The dinner rush had not started yet.  We ordered our food and waited AT LEAST an hour and a half.  The waitress came back and said they were \"busy in the kitchen\".  However, looking around the restaurant, there were still many empty tables. Some people, who came in after us, got their food before us. Under staffed? Maybe.   Once the food came it was obvious it sat under a heat lamp for an extended amount of time. My steak (requested medium) was well-done. I could tell the quality of the steak was good and the seasoning was also good.  Others at the table mentioned their steak was also over-cooked.  Mashed potatoes had a crust on them due to obviously sitting under a heat lamp.   In general, the food here is good.  But if I wanted a burnt steak I can get two for 20$ at Applebee's."}
{"text":"I stayed at this beautiful hotel several times while attending company sponsored training or operation meetings, and one of the benefits of hosting these types of events here is certainly the room accommodations as well as the onsite dining option. Beau's provides adequate but what I would call an average menu for a hotel sponsored restaurant, I certainly think the service and setting is above average with a well trained staff which is exhibited throughout this facility. It's oblivious this restaurant is more about providing food service catering to the the corporate customers and less about the food, although the pricing gives the impression this is a much more upscale venue than the food represented here. I read reviews of special celebrations, I can't say from my experience the dining rises to that level, even though I've experienced numerous meals here including breakfast, lunch buffets, hors d'oeuvres, and dinner service. I will say there's no doubt about the view, it is absolutely amazing so if ambience is the draw for those wanting to celebrate the milestones in their lives it would be tough to argue that point. The backdrop of the Cuyahoga River Gorge rushing past the giant panes of glass in the rear of the restaurant is breath-taking, and in someways competes with the food, the view is so over the top it's seems almost impossible that the food could ever be the main attraction here and fell short time after time. With the exception of the lunch buffet nothing here is terrible only disappointing in my opinion, I'm quite sure I'll return for other events and will continue to dine here since its usually incorporated into the program, I just hope the management raises the bar on the creativity and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Nice location overlooking the falls in Cuyahoga Falls, inside the Sheraton. Great to have Beau in a new location.   P.S.  Rachelle was great!"}
{"text":"While the food was fine, the Caesar salad better than bland pasta marinara, and my server was wonderful, I'm flabbergasted by what just happened. I got the side of pasta marinara and the poor server had to come tell me that the manager instructed her that there would be an upcharge for the grated Parmesan for my pasta. I've never encountered such a thing, no cheese for pasta? I asked to speak to the manager and that indeed is the case, there is an additional charge for grated Parmesan to sprinkle on pasta. So disappointing, it's not the cost, it's the customer service."}
{"text":"Although we only live 15 minutes away, this was our first visit to Beau's.  I must say, I was blown away by the \"million dollar view\" right in our back yard. View aside, the restaurant was just perfect for us.    It's hard for most couples, who enjoy different foods, too find a restaurant that has the \"something for everyone, classy menu\".  Tonight, I enjoyed the Ahi Tuna, and side salad, while my husband had his favorite type of foods--chicken wings, stuffed banana peppers and fries-- win win for both :-)   Challenging even more so for the craft beer lovers in us, is to find a restaurant that satisfies BOTH the food and drink criteria. Beau's did not disappoint. Super happy to have spent my 37th birthday dinner at Beau's! I highly recommend it. We will be back! ~Kevin and Tanya Pantalone"}
{"text":"Good service, great view. Food was a bit underwhelming, but nothing was bad. A variety of specials and standard menu items to choose from.   I recommend a flight of wines, and be sure to ask for a table with a view!"}
{"text":"Still loved the lobster bisque. But the rest of the meal was so so. Invited a couple of colleagues and I'm certain that they were disappointed with all the rave I've told them about the restaurant"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a spontaneous date night and what a fun treat it was.    We had a beautiful view from our booth.  Service was a bit slow and my water glass was empty quite often.  My husband had the oysters and I had mozzerella sticks.  These were incredible mozzarella sticks...  Clearly made in house and not frozen.  I could have ordered two and been happy with dinner.  I then had the chicken parm which was a huge portion and my husband had a steak.  It was just...eh.  For dessert I had the peanut butter pie and my husband had the apple crostada, I believe.  We both loved it and my husband said he wished he could have poured the leftover caramel sauce into his mouth.  We will definitely come back for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Apparently everything was updated about 6 months ago and they have not updated anything to reflect that. We went to eat at Beau's for lunch and they were closed. We then ordered dessert that according to their room service menu should've only totaled about twenty bucks with tip etc. It ended up being thirty bucks but once again we were blind sided by the false advertisement. We're disappointed but luckily Burntwood Tavern down the road was there to save the day."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of Beau's in Fairlawn I was very excited when we found out this was opening not even a mile from our home. We had our rehearsal dinner at the Fairlawn location so it's kind of a special place for us. AND, boy were we let down.   First, the location is GORGEOUS. If you can grab a window seat you're in luck. This was really the only good quality about the place on this visit.   Our server seemed frazzled. Maybe a first night? She didn't know any specials and when we asked she would go get the specials for entrees but not the specials for anything else so she would need to go get those.   Food was OK. The menu is not the same as the fairlawn location. Missing a lot of awesome things which was a disappointment. I ended up with a burger which was burnt which a nice slap of cheese to cover the burnt part.   Also, my fries arrived after my burger was finishes. Waitress was apologetic but not sure why fries take so long? Said she would take them off our check but never did and by the time it took to just cash out, I didn't even care.   Won't go back!"}
{"text":"What a disappointing night. Made a reservation for 14 for a friends Chrismas.  We Asked to sit by the windows. They did not want to sit us by the windows. After asking several times, they finally seated us there. There was one other table besides ours, service was incredibly slow.   We were not told because we were a group, that we would have a reduced menu.  Yes reduced menu for 12 people. Food was served cold. To correct, she said they would put in pan and rewarm (seemed more microwaved) and not food served at same time.  Just very disapointd in the experience.  Sadly we will not return."}
{"text":"Today was our church senior citizen's Christmas luncheon at Beau's, with 20 of us attending. It was arranged that we would all have the buffet ($13.95). I also ordered a Caribbean Dream Martini ($8.00). Tax and tip were included with the size of our group, so the bill came to $27.83.  There was an extensive and delicious salad buffet, along with cream of potato soup. There was only one main entree (meatloaf) which was dry, so I had to request gravy, which three of my friends shared with me, so I wasn't the only who felt that way about the meatloaf. There was also steak fries, rigatoni, and green beans (which were very tough). There was also a dessert table with brownies, lemon bars, and cheesecake."}
{"text":"The servers are very pleasant here and the view of the river is great if you can sit by the windows. The best thing here are the mashed potatoes! You must get them if you come here. I recently got the chopped sirloin which is on their lighter faire menu and that was very good. My only problem with this visit was we ordered mozzarella sticks, which I put a picture of and they look absolutely delicious. However, we tasted them and we could tell there was some seasoning on there that was definitely not normally present so the server checked with the kitchen and here they had made the recipe incorrect and there was too much horseradish sauce put in. The Kitchen did apologize and they took it off our bill, but my question was if they knew they made the recipe incorrect why did they serve it?"}
{"text":"Just had a lovely romantic dinner overlooking the cuyahoga falls. We started with the ahi tuna and the pierogis. Our entrees were the succulent grilled pork chops and the vegetable ravioli  with sautéed vegetables. They have a fine wine list as well. Our meal was so great that we thought we'd try dessert as well and that didn't disappoint. We tried the riccota cheese cake topped with raspberries and raspberry coulis and the peanut butter silk pie. We also had some tasty cappuccinos. I don't know why this place has garnered such poor reviews. I think it's delightful."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  My husband and I go at least twice a year. We always have the best food. The Lobster Bisque is better than we've ever eaten, even in Maine. It has such a unique flavor.   The views of the river are beautiful. It's a great location right off of Route 8 in The Sheraton."}
{"text":"The management at Beau's convinced us to come back and try them again. Their approach was extremely admirable, and the service we received while we were there was so much better. Whether they knew we had a previously poor experience prior or not, everyone was extremely kind and attentive.  I really really want to love this place. The decor is very nice, and you just can't beat that view. Unfortunately the food just does not live up to ambiance. It is too highly priced for the quality of food we were receiving. Nearly everything we tried tasted frozen and bland.  I am very appreciative of the management and staff for their ability to turn our service-experience around, and have raised my star because of this."}
{"text":"Food: Ok Service: Excellent  Ambience: Amazing   This place is all about amazing views of the river just beautiful. That and the service are the only outstanding items about Beau's and they make the entire experience worth it. I wish the food matched up to the views. The food is what you except from your average catering service. The city chicken was the only thing that stood out in my mind everything else was average. I do recommend people come and sit next to the windows because the view is amazing other than that nothing exceptional about the food."}
{"text":"After purchasing a new truck with my boyfriend we came here to celebrate.   For the price of everything I was quite disappointed.   Beef carpaccio is hands down one of my favorite meals, and I solely picked this place because they had it on the menu. The appetizer was probably the worst carpaccio I've ever had in my life. It was flavorless and dry. Really bland and just boring.   The tuna app was similar, just bland and boring, and the tuna had a \"fishy\" taste like it was beginning to go bad.  For entrees we had the rack of lamb, and scallop special. Although the entrees were better flavored, the scallops were gritty, and crunched when we chewed them.   The best part of the meal was the dessert. We had the peanut butter pie.   Our server was knowledgable and friendly.  The ambiance was so bright. I think they needed to dim the lights a little.  Overall 3 stars for service and lamb dish. Will not return as we were not impressed with any dish of the night."}
{"text":"I've only been to the lounge here because the restaurant wasn't open at the time.  Regardless, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  The view here is stunning.  They have a great selection of wine and cocktails.  The food is spectacular.  I look forward to going back in the future."}
{"text":"I will definitely come back to this place. It's very nice and the morning breakfast buffet is where it is at!!! True Story! I went because there was a Groupon promotion for it and  it was very well worth it. The scenery is beautiful if you are lucky enough to get a window seat. I have been here also for lunch. I had the lobster bisque. It was not the best I ever had, actually it was one of my least favorites I've ever had, but it did have a lot of lobster in it. Seemed to have too much Sherry in it for me.  The other tings were good. I ate the perogies, they where good. I would recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place. I took my girlfriend on a date on her birthday there. Perfect place for romantic dinner. It was Thursday night at 9 pm and there were not many people. So felt like the whole place was ours only. It has astonishing view on the river. During daylight and night it looks very cool. We had table for two in nice and quite part of the restaurant. So we could have some privacy. The service was great. For appetizer we took delicious pirogi. The only thing the prices are quite high, but it is worth each penny for the atmosphere we got. Also the menu is online, so I checked the price in advance and was aware of it. We both took fish entrees, which were alright. I thought fish would be baked, but it was deep fried. It has nice wine collection. Overall entrees were alright, pirogi were delicious and wine (glass of Pinot Noir and glass of Chardonnay) was good. Also we walk along there river after dinner. Actually, don't have to dine there in order to walk along the river ;)"}
{"text":"Simply the best lobster bisque I have ever had. Seriously, no joke, absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"First time at Beau's On The River and can't wait to go back. The Sunday brunch was awesome. The food was all very tasty & fresh. There was a nice assortment of fresh salads, good breakfast foods, fix yo order items-cinnamon French toast was awesome, nice selection of hot dinner choices- loved the cod & of course desserts.  From the moment we entered the restaurant, everyone was so kind & helpful as one in our party had a walker. The view while eating was very relaxing & beautiful. We stayed & visited & never felt hurried to leave. Our waitress was very very nice, attentive & offered to take pictures for us. Everything about this Sunday brunch is 5 star!!! Looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Its freezing out there and didnt want to leave hotel. reviews where not encouraging but...whataheck. worst it can happen is another bad experience for the books. I was surprised. First, on why the weak reviews. Beau has very good food, a decent wine list and world class service. People of Akron and vicinities, rejoice! You have an top notch restaurant that stands tall against any global city (believe me, I've been around). Second, the plate creativities are remarkable. kumquat orange peel marmalade infused of habanero is a match made in heaven, one of those that makes perfect sense but never have had before. And the execution of a tricky fish like steelhead trout (too soon its soggy, too much its dry) was flawless. Could it get any better? Make sure you ask for a spot with the river view and the beautiful icicle formations on the rocks."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere for a date. overall selection was small. service was good anf friendly. great view of the river."}
{"text":"We attended Beau's for the Sunday brunch. Overall the meal was mediocre. The brunch offered a good blend of lunch and breakfast, included a station for omelet, waffles , and prime beef carving stations. The food was average, good basic food with no Flavors that blew me away. Service was attentive.   The one thing I was blown away by was the view. Overlooking the river was gorgeous while we were eating our meal. Being from Cleveland, I probably would not come back as it is a long drive and there is much better food in CLE."}
{"text":"Returned for a buffet lunch. Don't be fooled by the picture of what Groupon shows as the buffet lunch! It's not even close. While it's not bad, it's a single main dish. No choices. The day I went, it was catfish. One entree, one vegetable (green beans) one starch (potato).  The picture seems to show seared tuna and it looks delicious. I wonder if they ever have that for the buffet though. While the lunch was good, it was not special not what a buffet should be, with some variety. For the price, it's disappointing."}
{"text":"Don't order the wedge salad (soaked in salad dressing) with tomatoes, blue cheese and bacon. The first time it arrived it looked like a thick soup. The 2nd time dressing was on the side but the bacon and tomato pieces were all but missing. There was never an apology given by the server. We were charged twice for the salad; then the 2nd salad was removed but the tax remained and the server said she couldn't remove it. Be careful, and check your bill should you decide to dine here."}
{"text":"There was a Groupon promotion for lunch/breakfast buffet for Beau's at this location which I took advantage of as I had not visited this place since it had switched from an Italian restaurant a few years ago.  My partner and I were seated quickly at the bottom part of the dining room where the best views were. We took a quick look at the lunch buffet options ($13.95) but decided to go a la carte instead.   Our waiter was pleasant and efficient, filling our glasses with ice cold water from a bottle immediately as we sat down. We ordered an appetizer of calamari, and entrees of the pizza of the day and fish and chips. The calamari arrived quickly and it was lightly breaded, deep fried, then sauteed with a light citrus sauce of peppers and garlic. It was quite tasty and we would definitely order it again.  Our entrees came shortly after we finished the appetizer. The pizza consisted of bacon, spinach, onions and 3 cheeses. It was lightly sauced, heavily cheesed with a soft crust. It wasn't bad but nothing too exciting. The fish and chips dish came with some tartar sauce and a small serving of vinegary coleslaw. The chips (french fries) were nice and crispy which I enjoyed. The fish, I didn't enjoy so much. The fish was served as \"sticks\" lightly coated with cornmeal. It was cooked well but alas, it wasn't too well seasoned and tasted quite bland.  Overall, the food was average, the service was good and the ambiance/view was superior."}
{"text":"This past June we enjoyed Sunday Brunch at Beau's and we can't say enough good things about the view, food and service.  Our server at brunch was a gentleman who actually knew how to serve.  I was so impressed with his kindness that I assumed the dinner servers were just as top rate -----so we reserved for dinner in August and turns out I was wrong.    We had 5:30 dinner reservation on Saturday 8/26.  Did not get out of there until around 8pm.  The wait between fly-by's by our waitress was unacceptable. It was a birthday, and inexperienced waitress never mentioned they offered desert menu.  Her service was \"fly-by\" due to the large number of tables and customers she attempted to handle.  She was in over her head, and bordering on arrogant.  This restaurant needs experienced, older servers during dinner, not what they offer now.   The gentleman waiter who works during the brunch service, should train the dinner servers and they would have better results. For dinner, the restaurant should seriously consider replacing the plastic place mats with table cloths and maybe a candle on each table would be nice touch or a flower when they know it is someone's birthday.  Put it on the bill, I'll pay for it.  Maybe offer a little birthday package with dinner? A tiny cupcake, a single rose and mini-balloon?  Any marketing geniuses out there?  Anyplace that is going to cost me $120 for two meals, one app, and a tip (and no alcohol) should provide the whole package.  My birthday guest got no special notice or desert and I was let down, to say the least.  Great view/ambiance, good food and poor service.  They score A- on the first, B+ on the second, and a D-/F on the last."}
{"text":"I stay at the Sheraton where Beau's is located in pretty ofter for work. I have ordered a lot of their room service (smaller menu) as well as have eaten at the restaurant. By far the best thing on their menu IMO is their rack of lamb. The first time I had it, I was blown away. I've had it two more times and unfortunately it was over cooked, which was a shame!  I've probably had the salmon the most often and it is pretty unpredictable how it will turn out. Out of maybe 8 orders I'd say it was only cooked well once as well, it's usually a bit over done. Ive also tried their hummus wrap, calamari and wings all of which are too greasy or heavy.  I recently tried their smoked salmon and shrimp and grits (wo bacon) and that was pretty good.  Overall their food is decent, it def is a great option when I'm working late and don't have time to leave. But I definitely wish there were some healthier options available on the room service menu."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the years, but last night was something unexpected. My lunch earlier in the day was way less than noteworthy but we headed back for dinner when our meal elsewhere with clients was cancelled.   We ordered the special menu appetizer which was a cheese plate and we shared it between two. Looked OK, with one portion of the cheese looking a little too like crappy orange cheddar. Surprise. Every morsel was delicious, enhanced by the toasted bread, quince jam, and amazing pickled onion jam. Wow! And more than enough for two.   We both ordered salmon, over a bed of quinoa with kale. The half portion. Which was ample. Hotels like this usually try too hard, but this dish was exceptional. Understated yet perfect in every way and moving me to post a review. I would love to have it again tonight, it was that good.   We split the molten chocolate cake for dessert. The wait person was super honest that the was not much \"molten\" here, but that if you get past that and have ice cream with it, it's really good. And right she was.   Bravo!"}
{"text":"Our group of 13 friends decided to have our holiday dinner/gift exchange here on a Wed. nite after Xmas.  Most of us had never been and wanted to try it.  We made reservations at least 3 weeks in advance and upon arriving we were seated at a big table by the window, as requested.  The good pretty much ends there.  While perusing the menu we noticed that some of us had different ones.  I had checked out the menu in advance online in the weeks prior and was kinda excited of the size and diversity of the menu.  We questioned the server and were told that large parties were restricted to ordering off of the dinner menu only. Of course the most expensive and not very exciting.  Had we sat in the lounge we could have ordered small plates, sandwiches, burgers, WEDGE salad(can't get that in the dining room) plus the full dinner menu.  There is no mention of this RULE anywhere on the website or when we made the reservation.  20% gratuity on parties of 8 or more? No problem. Diff menu with no warning? On a Wed nite with practically no one in the place? Huge problem.  All sides are also extra, even with a $30 steak; several dishes were brought out barely warm, there were inconsistent portion sizes of the same dish, service wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. My meal of mussels and lobster bisque was just OK.(Woulda got that steak if it would have come with SOMEthing)  And we are not cheap.  If we had lots of options and good service I'm betting we would've stayed longer, shared more food, had more drinks and spent more $$. As it was it seemed that we all couldn't wait to get out of there.   Can't complain about the drinks though, they were good.  Should've stayed in the bar but we didn't even know that was an option.  Much better places to eat in the Akron area.  Major disappointment."}
{"text":"The restaurant has great view. We used to like their week day buffet or the Sunday brunch. Have not bring here for at least 2 years after we moved out of cuyahoga falls. This time we came because there was a groupon sale. Was very disappointed for the week day lunch buffet. Selection was very limited. Probably only half of what they used to offer but with the same price. Especially not suitable with young kids. My daughter only had apple sauce and banana. Won't be back for lunch buffet again. I may just order from menu if I come again and hope that is a lot better than buffet!"}
{"text":"We always come to this restaurant and hotel for our anniversary and I don't know why I never left any review before. Well this is a very laid back restaurant where you can actually sit down and enjoy a decent drink and meal with out any rush. Staff is very down to earth, helpful and laid back. The salmon ALT was very fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was extremely slow and MIA. It took 30 min to get our appetizers and we had to track down our waitress to find out what happened to our entrees. Entrees just arrived. We are now over an hour into our meal. Entree was good. Now need to track down our waitress to get the bill and get out before I am two hours into this meal."}
{"text":"Had a business buffet lunch at this very pretty restaurant overlooking a small waterfall river, where apparently people raft. Buffet had a small selection. I didn't pay, so I'm not sure how much it was. But it was pretty, decent food/small selection, and nice ambiance. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"I have past this place a ton of times but never tried it. I remember the one in Fairlawn but have never been to that one. So tonight was a special night so we decided to go hear since it looked like a nicer upscale restaurant. It was. Great views. Calm and cool servers and the food was well prepared. I was there with someone who was disabled so they were not able to use stairs. The facility does have an access elevator that allows people who are disabled to reach the dining room. That elevator was disgusting. It was sticky. Every single thing was sticky. The rails, the floor. I did not want to touch anything for fear that I would need a shower. I simply do not get why a place can be so nice. Even have a service elevator for the disabled and let the elevator be in such dirty shape. I am in the process of becoming a health inspector. Though no food was served or prepared in the elevator I must say it is pretty gross to touch a sticky wall of an elevator than eat food. My only other complaint is a two parter. 1. like many upscale places they give a small dish size serving of ketchup and not the bottle itself. 2. Its not Heinz. Its a different brand often used at high end facilities. It has a much more tomato like taste and is much more acidic. It's so acidic that it actually masks the flavor of the food. I had fries with my meal and actually had a few without ketchup... which is unheard of for me, because they tasted better without the ketchup they had. Clean the elevator, get a lighter ketchup and you got yourself a regular on special occasions."}
{"text":"Both wife and I had excellent dinner here. Swordfish was outstanding. Not crowded, got right in on a Friday night, nice. Staff was excellent also. We will return soon"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner last night celebrating our anniversary. Wendy our server was outstanding. We were not in a hurry and she didn't rush us out even though they were busy. She was knowledgeable on the menu and we were pleased with our selection. We split the mussels as an appetizer. They were clean and tender in a light broth. We also shared the gem salad which was a special. Grilled lettuce with pickled onion and big chunks of heirloom tomatoes. My husband had the Ahi tuna which was seared perfectly and I had the small plate shrimp and grits with a wonderful onion jus and bacon jam. Perfect! It was worth the hour drive."}
{"text":"My wife and I ended up here for a date night and Beau's did not disappoint. The view is beautiful, though there are only a few prime spots that provide the beat views of the river. Everyone else just has to sit there and be jealous.  The service was spectacular. The young lady taking care of us was knowledgeable, helpful, and checked in on us just enough.  The rack of lamb was a current special, and I went for it. Preparing lamb separates the cooks from the chefs.   It was perfect. I cannot recall the reduction that it was served with, but I do recall my plate being clean.  My wife went with the steak - she always does - and was a big fan.   The wine list was nice and, honestly, the prices are not bad at all. Sometimes higher end places charge obscene prices, but Beau's was reasonable.  All in all, big thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Valentine's dinner here Saturday night. We made a day of it in Cuyahoga Falls. Some shopping, lunch and closing the evening out at Beau's. Great location in the lower level of the Sheraton. We had Great view of the river. Even in the dark you could see it. Very professional staff. Our waiter made some suggestions of his favorite entrees. Drinks, then appetizer of Cajun shrimp with white cheddar grits. Was very good. The spice was just right and the grits were good. My wife doesn't like grits but she liked these. She had a salad and filet mignon. She is picky how her steaks are cooked and normally gets them butterflied but didn't this time. Came out perfect. She selected carrots as a side dish. I had the salmon which was one of the suggestions. Didn't disappoint as it was very good. This came with rice and I added a small wedge salad.  Deserts were offered but was too full. Prices were in line with the type of place and food quality  I would consider Beau's slightly upscale. For the 2 of us was $112 without tip. Plenty of parking and they had complimentary ballet.  Reservations recommended for special occasions. I would come back and recommend as a good choice for anniversaries and special occasions. ."}
{"text":"Great service and top notch steaks. I couldn't ask for anything more. Except for an amazing view which it also has."}
{"text":"Amazing lobster bisque. I am never a fan on entrees but the beau loves them. Great martini and apps. Gorgeous view. Thursday is half price wine. Excellent happy hour joint."}
