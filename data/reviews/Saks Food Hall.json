{"text":"Very good spot for food, gourmet food purchases, groceries, or food gifts. The turkey and Brie cheese on a croissant is a delicious choice. As was the mozzarella with tomato and basil sandwich on white panini. Really great choices for any appetite or eater at this food hall. Sharing is also a good option to try the different offerings. To tempt you there are luxurious to everyday foods that are affordable and tasty. I would come here for a coffee or tea break as well as if I was preparing a special meal I could cook at home, or one that I needed prepared. Excellent prepared foods with lots to choose from. Well worth a visit any day of the week. There are holiday selections right now as well, which make it extra fun and festive. There is a full service champagne bar and sushi bar which were busy. I'd try those the next time when I had more time to linger.  Very good spot."}
{"text":"Best place for organic or quality food! Sorelle & co sells the best vegan donuts and other treats! It's a must try bakershop if you come to the food hall. It's my favorite place to get a sweet treat in the afternoon . Get some healing from the sweet!"}
{"text":"Delish! Every single food option here is great! It's fresh and healthy, I love the Pukkah and North Poke, both amazing. It is a little on the pricey some but the high quality is evident."}
{"text":"If you are ever thinking about where to grab lunch in the downtown core, you must go to  Saks Food Hall and grab some North POKE!   Trust me!!!!!!!  It's so full of flavor and It will not disappoint your taste buds. 

I go for the Wakame, with brown rice!  It comes with tarp chips as well.   
For the regular bowl It costs $13.00

Get your Poke on!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great area to open the renown pusateri! Opened the second week of November and has been crazy busy since it's opened. Lots of different food specialties ranging from a seafood section, sushi section, bakery, gourmet cold cuts and cheese, BBQ (with steak/ribs), pizza/paninni and a full on grocery shop. if you've been to other pusateri before then you will not be overly surprised in the quality and variation of products they carry. You can find most vegetable/fruits/meats in their grocery section at a fairly decent price. Mind you, this is not a no frills.. so don't expect prices to be dirt cheap but if you were craving for salami and cannot venture out to a cheaper grocery store, i would definitely recommend getting certain groceries here. it was about 2.69$ per 100g for the hot Italian salami which is very comparable to other local downtown grocery stores (sobeys/longos close by). They also partnered with my all time favourite scone place (Baker and Scone) and now i do not have to venture to St Clair west to get their delectable scones!!! They also have the greenhouse cleansing juice popup shop there as well (i actually think they're here to stay) so for any juicers that work close to the eaton centre, look no further because there is one right in the smack of the heart of shopping district.

Their cheese room/section is to DIE for... any type of artisan cheese you can imagine, it's there! Need a bag of potato chips and don't want to walk to a local shoppers? Pusateri also has it there as well. Need to get some flowers for the partner? They also carry a range of beautiful tulips and mixed bouqets. Overall, its a one stop shop for anything gourmet and yummy.

Extremely clean and staff are also very friendly... will be dangerous now that i work just right above this!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to discover a Pukka location since it's one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. I ordered the Chicken65 only to find myself extremely disappointed by the salty, soggy mess I received. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"PSA: Pukka has a pop-up food station at Saks right now. Not sure how many weeks they'll be here, but note their early-ish closing times (6PM weekends and 6:30PM weekdays) for all you downtown employees who like to eat dinner at the office. 5/5 for the Pukka chaat ($13), which is vegetarian, but can be made vegan with yogurt omitted. It's a huge portion and super filling, comes with lots of puffed rice, pomegranate seeds, etc and lots of flavor. 4/5 for the pumpkin curry ($12), which is vegan. The curry is probably one of the best I've ever had - sweet from the pumpkin, excellent dense texture, and the seasoning is just right. Lost one star because the portion of actual curry was too small IMO. Instead so much basmati white rice was given... Not interested. 

For non-vegetarians - the other 2 options are shrimp biryani and a chicken main. Def check them out if you like quality Indian food and don't want to TTC to their main restaurant!"}
{"text":"I feel like I've landed in heaven. The Sak's Food Hall (Pusateris to me) contains a collection of superb food shoppes. You can find organic fruits, vegetables, vegan pastries that rival the fanciest and tastiest of bakeries and fine tea and coffee. There's fancy shop after fancy shop and you can find anything you need here (excellent quality fish, meats, cheese, bread, etc.)

Note: if you don't know where this food Hall is located, the easiest way to find it is by entering via Hudson's Bay on Queen and taking the escalator down."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved prepared food. Wonderful place! Beautiful! Excellent selection. Amazing deserts and coffee. Great service. Absolutely five stars!"}
{"text":"David Chow chocolates sold here!  Gorgeous chocolates on display and they are like mini edible artwork!   

I always loved the lower level of the hudsons bay and now that it's partly a Sak's food hall from Pusateri's , it's wonderful. 

It's starting to be more reminiscent of the food halls in Japanese and Taiwanese department stores .  :-) 

Yes some of the items are a tad pricey, but a great place to find gifts....with lots of foot traffic.   

They opened just in time for Xmas shopping."}
{"text":"I only recently discovered this place, operated by Pusateri's, and I was impressed with the choices and quality of food available. If I worked nearby, I would probably be here every day for lunch and maybe even takeout for dinner. It would take me a very long time to run out of choices, and then I would just start all over again.

I shared a couple of pizzas with friends, vegetarian and sausage. They were very good and I really liked the crust. It was crispy and light, just right.

There are so many other choices available, including salads, meats, sushi, baked goods, healthy choices, decadent choices, and more! You can even buy groceries!

I will definitely come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"What's not to like. There is a Pusateri's and a Sorelle and quality and service is consistent with their other locations.

Started with a couple of sandwiches
Grilled cheese on sourdough (could have been grilled longer to melt all that cheese)
Prosciutto with fiore de latte and arugula on baguette - amazing

Free samples abound

Finished off with a crinkle cookie for the kid at Sorelle, safe for most allergies and very delicious.

This is nothing like Eaton Centre food court eats of old, and that is a good thing. :)"}
{"text":"Very upscale and posh food area. The pristine clean white look of Sorelle just screams elegance. Dropped by Sorrelle as what was on display had grabbed my attention. Went with a carrot cupcake and the orange citrus donut. Both items were good but the orange and citrus donut definitely was the highlight. Definitely could make out the gluten free taste/texture."}
{"text":"Ever eaten something that has left you with an aftertaste so great that all you want is more of the same? When event the burps taste just as good coming back up as the food did going down? Well that is a smoked cheddar and grilled tomato grilled cheese sandwich at the Pusateri food hall. My tastebuds are in a blissful place right now and I don't want this to ever stop.

The only negative about this place is the limited places to sit during the busy lunch rush. I will be back though to try out the other gastronomical delights in this place. Off to a great start so far."}
{"text":"I'm soooo happy the food hall has SORELLE, gluten-free VEGAN Treats mmmmm, 
They also make the best gluten free, vegan bread I've ever had! Great location, super busy during lunch time. Genius idea for Puseteri to open up @ HBC"}
{"text":"This Foodhall is definitely a treat.  From fresh fruits to cured meats to gluten free bakery the Bay hosts Saks/Pusateri luxury for the downtown workers and commuters.  At a higher price point than regular grocery stores but well presented and most read to eat food items this Foodhall is great for quick delicious and healthy choices.

In the morning there is an oatmeal bar for $6.95 and a salad bar at lunch (by weight).  Smoothies bar to breakfast bar... Chocolate, cakes, gluten Free bakery (Sorelle) and a coffee counter are all available.  Now until June 30th they are hosting North Poke (and this is my favourite)!"}
{"text":"Every Department Store should have a Food Hall like Saks! Best thing ever happen for Eaton Centre complex. 

Here you can do your grocery shopping, pick up a snack and even a whole meal. Indian food from Pukka, Poke Bowl from North Poke, Grilled Cheese Sandwich with soup and even freshly made to order pizza, Sweet from Sorrelle. If you want to be fancy, even a Champagne Bar!

An one stop foodie experience without venturing out in the cold.

A little pricier than regular grocery stores but not kind of expected due to the location and the selections they offers!"}
{"text":"I realkyenhoy walking around this place so much. You can taste everything as far as the eye can see. There even direct access to the Queen subway station, and there is also a Starbucks. There's foodwares and company as well. I will continue coming here evety week to grab a bite to eat. There is also a Squish brand gummies shop. There's O&B as well with all their confectionary. I also love the macarons that they make here. It's comfy and cozy here. I never wanna leave. The lure of the food just brings me hefe all the time. What an experience in food."}
{"text":"David H. Chow is an infamous pastry chef and more importantly, a chocolatier in Toronto. One of the most popular products would probably be the photogenic BONBONS. It is different from regular chocolate, because they are handcrafted with love and care. Each piece is unique, and they often have various layers of flavors. Chocolatiers will use their creativity and bring surprises into each piece. That's why, I am very obsessed with bonbons. So I have begged my friend, who was going to visit her boyfriend in Toronto, to bring me a box of those mysterious and beautiful bonbons as souvenir. 

My friend bought a box of 12, and it is $32/box. Yes, I have to admit that bonbons are way more expensive than regular chocolate. However, I can also guarantee that you would not regret of trying once in your lifetime. 

Here are the 12 flavors that I get to try (from top row): 

1. Raspberry Tonka Bean
2. Stirling Butter Caramel
3. Meyer Lemon Thyme
4. 70% Dark Chocolate
5. White Truffle Hazelnut
6. Mango Pineapple Habanero
7. Arbequina Olive Oil
8. Banana Passion Fruit
9. Grapefruit & Black Sesame
10. Sweet Corn Tarragon
11. Spiced Cherry Pistachio
12. Yuzu & Bergamot

My #1 favourite would be Grapefruit & Black Sesame - simple but bomb! This combination definitely brings out the black sesame flavor, but the subtle sourness still remains. My #2 is Yuzu & Bergamot - \"citrusy\". My #3 would be the Mango Pineapple Habanero -  spicy. Yes, you read it right! At first, I did not know what Habanero, but the taste of the chocolate explains it all. It was sweet at first, but after few seconds, the spiciness kicks in. Very strong and surprising, but I had fun eating it. My least favourite would probably be the Spiced Cherry Pistachio, because it definitely has a very strong \"medicine/cough syrup flavor\", and I was never a fan of cherry coming in other forms in my food. 

Overall I enjoyed my box of bonbons, and it was great to taste an entirely new world and flavors from a different chocolatier. Though I have to say that my friends and I agreed that there are some \"hit or miss\" flavors, we all recommend you to go and check it out at least once if you were ever in Toronto. Currently they are selling them at Saks Food Hall by Pusateri's in Eaton Center. Or you can check out their website to look for more locations. 

Taste: 4/5 * Quality-Price: 4.5/5"}
