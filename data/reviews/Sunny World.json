{"text":"This is a review for the new place, since it is no longer Sunny World.  The food was just ok, what really makes this such a poor rating is the service. When I went, there weren't that many people sitting down but I had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. The waiters would look over and it would appear they were apprehensive to seat more people. When I finally was seated, I overheard people complaining about the same issue. One group of people experienced it too and seated themselves.  We came for dinner. I don't remember much about the menu but it came with soup. What is supposed to be an appetizer (the soup) took 20 minutes! And the drinks even longer. I don't know what the heck is wrong with these people but they really weren't that busy to warrant such slow service. As I said earlier, the food was just ok. In my opinion you'd get better tasting Chinese food from Panda Express."}

{"text":"Worst Chinese ever. Wontons in the wonton soup were mushy."}
{"text":"Went to try Sunny World as it was close to home, mistake #1, girl/waitress taking our order to go had difficulty with english and had to go to the kitchen numerous times to see what was in a dish, mistake #2' order came out and manager tried to make lame jokes ( that I can deal with). Took the order home and upon opening the Kung Pao combo (beef,chicken & shrimp), I found a slimy mess of lettuce, vegetables(I think) and NO meat whatsoever ! The order of cashew chicken had a small amount of what may have been chicken but was void of any flavor and was greasy. When I called the establishment to complain about the slop that was served and that it was nothing close to what was ordered, the girl that answered the phone said \"sorry\", nothing else, no attempt to correct the matter, transfer to the joke making manager or any other resolution, mistake #3. This is an establishment that should be avoided at all costs, if most restaurants fail in the first year it is because of situations like this, poor customer service, lack of remorse for substandard food etc. I only wish I could give a lower star than one."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here the other night, and honestly was quite happy with it. It's not true New York styled Chinese, but it is pretty close. Everything tasted extremely fresh, not greasy and was flavorful. My only gripe is that like many Chinese places out here, their \"eggrolls\" are just spring rolls. Anyone from back East will understand the difference between the two. Will definitely keep ordering from here, and will recommend them out to others. We tried the chicken lo mein, pork lo mein, general tso's chicken and fried rice. Will be trying other menu items in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Place doesn't look like much from the outside but quite charming inside. The wait staff is very nice and very busy but still manages to take care of customers.   The Orange Chicken, Lemon Chicken, Sweat & Chicken, and Beef With Broccoli are excellent. Those are the only things we have had so far and it has been some of the best around.   Definitely worth a visit. Once word gets out about this place there will be a line waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"I went back again to try dinner.    This time service get improve.   Wondering how can they make the profit with the price that they have!!   Anyway to compare with other chinesse food in this area. No one can beat Sunny world.    Now on lazy day to cook we mostly go there. ;)"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to eat here yesterday and found the food to be delicious.  I had a Kung Pao Chicken combo plate.  It came with rice, small egg roll, crab puff, and  delicious egg drop soup.  Very reasonably priced.  I am going to take my 4 grandsons here tonight.  Glad to finally find a Chinese restaurant that I want to return to.  My friend got a big bowl of sizziling rice soup which she enjoyed too.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese food place in the east valley.  The food was tasty, and the portions were generous.  You can see the pictures I posted of the general Tso's, sesame, and broccoli chicken dishes we ordered.  All three were good, although the broccoli chicken lagged behind the others for flavor.  If you are in the east valley and looking for Chinese, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"nice place to dine out.staff are friendly.food is not that great but im good with it would recommend to others"}
{"text":"Pros: best Chinese soup that I have ever had. Clean and nice ambiance. General Tso Chicken was good. No greasy food here.   Cons: $3.99 lunch special is only for a few meals. I was sweating because the AC wasn't cool enough. We were the only customers there that the staff did not ask us for refills. Felt like the regular customers were more important."}
