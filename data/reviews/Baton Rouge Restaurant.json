{"text":"Everything Madelaine has said below is right on the money.   Thank goodneas for The Keg that is literally right across the street.   If the Keg turns out to be busy and starvation factor is an issue, i will hop over to baton rouge, although it is almost a last resort."}
{"text":"As John mentioned - they have absolutely mouth-watering, fall-off-the-bone ribs that satisfy in every way.    The only draw-back is that the price is a little more than your average run-of-the-mill Montana's rib meal.  The atmosphere is more suited for mature families and couples - and generally the servers have been great.  Waitresses have been very talkative and helpful in making decisions and making the dining experience an enjoyable one.  Their menu selection is more limited than elsewhere, but what they do (the ribs) they do well (the RIBS!).    Recommended to give it at least one shot..."}
{"text":"Dined here Jan 2011, it was a Saturday in Mississauga. Who would've thought a reservation was needed in this locale? Gf and I first planned on a simple meal at the Keg but found a 1+ hr wait, so across the road we go to Baton Rouge.  I had the rib steak, gf had a chicken + shrimp dish. The steak was badly overcooked and tough. The chicken dish was swamped in some kind of mass bottled steak sauce or the like. Suffice to say there wasn't a high point to any part of this meal.  I often avoid chain restos but in 'sauga that seems to be all there is. I would've had a better meal in a take-away shawarma restaurant.  Apologies to my fellow Yelpers, but anyone who's reviewed this place highly needs to just get out more."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for lunch. We both got steaks with ceasar salad and potatoes. The lettuce was not just brown but soggy and rotten, the ceasar dressing was sparse and tasted like a vinegrette, and the croutons were just like bland stale bread. We waited at least half an hour for our main course. My medium-well steak was still red and bloody in the centre(not \"brown with a trace of pink\"). The garlic mashed potatoes were very bland and I dont think they contained any garlic or ever the peels. Neither of us finished any of our food and we turned down the free dessert they offered us. They offered us gift cards but neither of us will ever be returning there so we turned them down. When I asked to speak to the manager to try and get some of our money back we were told she was on the phone and she just sent the waiter back with the same gift cards - unbelievable!"}
{"text":"So good I love this place the best place in the world for pork ribs. The service is  A1. All there other food is also great. But they are known to have the best ribs."}
{"text":"The crab cakes were wonderful and the mango relish was just the right touch. Ribs were fork-tender and delicious. Our waiter was excellent as well. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is completely and totally average.  For a place that's known for their ribs, I expected to go in and get blown away with the tenderness and flavour but instead just sort of found them average.  I came here a couple weeks ago as a group of 7 people. They sat us at a big round table (kind of nice because when you get long tables with groups it always ends up being a few small conversations rather than one big conversation).  The service was fine (they were training a girl on our table who fumbled a little, but nothing worth criticizing, everyone has to learn sometime, right?)  Over all nothing wrong with this place but nothing outstanding either. Because there are so many other options in the area I doubt I will ever go back but I don't think I'd discourage people from going either. Everything about this experience was average."}
{"text":"In terms of chain restaurants, this is one of the better options in Mississauga. Instead of the haphazard service of the booty baring Moxie's wait staff or mediocre food at Milestones, you can dine at Baton Rouge and get decent service and food. I've had their ribs each time and though it's not as good as some of the speciality bar-b-q places that are showing up all over GTA, it's quite decent. Large portions, not too fatty, not too tough (though it's not fall off the bone), and good flavour. They give you ridiculously large portions of the sides. I never ask for fries anymore because the size is about 2 times the amount you get at swiss chalet. I guess it's great for someone who has a big appetite. Their desserts tastes like it came from a McCain freezer container. Quite unoriginal and no flavour. I don't recommend them. The 3 times we've been here, the servers have been helpful, friendly, and attentive. FAR better than the Moxie and Milestone environment. I will agree that perhaps Baton Rouge is going for a different crowd (perhaps a bit more mature?) so maybe that's the difference. Either way, I would return here if we had to cater to someone's tastebuds who didn't venture far from pedestrian steak and potatoes."}
{"text":"It's been a bit over a year since I last visited Baton Rouge. Previously I didn't know what Yelp was (don't kill me!) so I couldn't express my disappointment...but now I can! I still remember that night as if it was today.  I dined here with a few of my friends for my 21st birthday (I'm 22 now). I chose this place for one reason, to try their prime rib. When the server came to take our order she told us that they weren't serving prime rib because they ran out. I was soooo disappointed, you have no idea. Instead, I ordered their seafood linguini because my sister raves about it...even right now as I am writing this haha.  The scallops and shrimps were ginormous (which I don't mind at all...I love seafood!). However, as I bit into the scallop it was freezing cold and still raw. I thought that maybe it was supposed to be like that so I swallowed it, huge mistake! I got my friend to try it out and he told me that it was raw. I called the manager over and he brought me back a new plate...this time it was fully cooked. At this point I was already upset...first, the prime rib and now the raw scallops. He didn't charge me for my meal (obviously) but I barely touched it because my appetite was ruined. My stomach started to feel uneasy by the end of dinner so I ran to the washroom to throw up.  Let's just say that dinner was a disaster and I am definitely never returning."}
