{"text":"Take a trip south, south of downtown, south of the 17 to find your way to Carniceria Castillo for some of the best Carne Asada in Phoenix. Drive to south mountain take in a hike or the views and do yourself a favor and stop in for their cooked carne on your way back. You'll find this market along the road, it's easy to pass right by, but they're likely cooking something out front on their BBQ grill and it's probably the chicken or beef you'll be eating in your tacos, burritos or nachos later that day and for the next few days to come.   Order a couple pounds because two pounds magically seems like three or four every time I order. Don't forget to peruse through the market for a Candy Coconut Roll, cause those things are awesome.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, eat more carne asada and eat it from here."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a small prepared food section in the back corner where you can get carnitas, chicharron, and other hot foods. I came here to get a container of delicious hot beans when I'm in a pinch. They also have a salsa bar area and a cooler with warm tortillas. There's a variety of Mexican candies and unique breads next to the counter."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with a $9.99 lunch combo that comes with a whole chicken, rice, beans, and corn tortillas. It's tasty too. Grab a couple sodas from the case and you have your self a great lunch for at least two people. If your in the area it's definitely worth a trip."}
