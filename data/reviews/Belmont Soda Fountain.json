{"text":"I am extremely thankful for the reopening and remodeling of my all-time favorite Belmont downtown childhood shops. Out is the overly abundant furnishings the previous owner have had and in with a more elegant modern but still classic feel to the place. 

When you walk in, go toward the back of the shop toward the end of the counter to order, you'll see the register and the menu will be to your left when you order.

Their soda fountain is still intact, so they still offer orangeade, malts, milkshakes, and hand-stirred sodas of kinds. Ice cream is back! A shelf full of classic candies to choose from as well. 

The ice cream is delish! You get to choose between a regular cone, waffle cone or cup(which comes in glass cup). Some flavors we've tried were vanilla, chocolate, butter pecan, cookies & creme, and black cherry. 

The only bummer we've had was the orangeade, it was not freshly squeezed when the lady made it even though they have fresh oranges in eyesight. We watched her take a bottle of pre-squeezed orange juice I believe out of the cooler and simply add simple syrup(not the real sugar) and water to it. It was pretty sour. 

Other than that, take yourself and kids there if you're in the area and mood :) Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I visited the Belmont Soda Fountain on July 24th for lunch. It was the most relaxed atmosphere with good food. The owner's mother greeted everyone that came in. The servers were knowledgeable. I plan to visit again and recommend everyone visit this nice, quaint restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is legit!  Screw Dairy Queen and any of the big guys, spend your money here and make sure these people are successful."}
{"text":"Went to the new Belmont Soda shop today. It was my first time being at an establishment making the past new again. The owners were so friendly and the food was amazing! While having lunch at their bar with my girlfriend and watching her enjoy her grape salad and orange lime ade.  I was pleasantly drawn in to my club sandwich and cherry lime ade. Who would have thought a hand mixed drink would taste so much better that a store bought one. Patron after patron came in and was pleasantly greeted and promptly served by owners. So many smiles to count both adult and child alike. I can't wait to visit again! Best of luck to the folks at Belmont Soda Shop you all deserve the best for serving the best!"}
{"text":"My mom and sister were visiting from out of town today and I had been wanting to check this place out so we stopped by for lunch. Cute interior, limited seating and pretty busy (half day for the school system may have contributed to this).  The woman behind the counter was very friendly, but unfortunately none of us enjoyed our food very much. 
- My mom ordered the Cobb salad. It was a decent size and looked okay except the shredded chicken on top was visibly dry. My mom said it was chewy. 
- My sister ordered the chicken salad sandwich and said it was okay (and ate most of it, which she wouldn't do if she didn't like it) but was surprised to find hard boiled egg in it. She also added a side of potato salad for $1.50 which all three of us tried and none of us liked. It tasted like a blob of sour cream. 
- I got the turkey sandwich and a Coke, since I wanted to experience the soda fountain aspect. The Coke was nothing special. It didn't taste as fizzy or flavorful as a regular Coke. The turkey sandwich description said it had pesto, cranberry, and Parmesan, which sounded delicious. The turkey was good but the sandwich as a whole was just weird. It was like they dumped a whole bag of craisins and a bag of shredded Parmesan cheese on the sandwich. Very weird texture. I ended up dumping off most of the craisins and cheese on the 2nd half of the sandwich. What was left was not worth $6.00. 
- My sister went back up and ordered a cookie sundae which was delicious and decent sized. I didn't see how much it cost. 
In conclusion, I'll come back here because I like to support local businesses, but I'll only be getting ice cream.  

Update: as I was typing this, my mom texted me to say my sister has an upset stomach and she's worried it may have been the chicken salad..."}
{"text":"Perfect blend if nostalgia and all natural great tasting quality food. We enjoyed the Ham & Provolone and Club w/grape salad.  The sandwiches were excellent. 

The grape salad is a must try! YUM! 

I was pleasantly surprised to be able to get my fresh squeezed Orangeade without added sugar.

Drinks were served in glasses and the food was served on Eco friendly plates."}
{"text":"Impressive!  Alejandro and I checked this place out!  I had never even tasted a Dessert in the \"Float\" Category!  The Idea of mixing something with Ice Cream is Incredibly Foreign to me!

RootBeer Syrup and IceCream in a Glass... an Unstirred treat in a Stirring Specialty Shop!

This place is Hip!  Exposed Brick Walls, a Bar that in my interpretation is a modern take on the DrugStore Soda Fountain...Perhaps too Hip for the Luvy Lu Lu La La's and her Daddy though it will be just fine for most of the others!

ManDate!  Ladies, if you are wondering where the Men in your \"party\" wunderedOFFtoo while you were shopping, check here first!

Learn the Rules!   Walk all the way down to the Register to order!"}
{"text":"This place is really neat. They did an excellent job of making you feel like your in an old fashioned soda shop. The staff were incredibly nice. I enjoyed a BLT and a side of potato salad. They were both very good, and they were served quickly. I am likely to return, it's a bummer they don't have places like this closer to my town (huntersville)"}
{"text":"This is a new shop that replaced the old Belmont Soda Shop. It has been beautifully remodeled by new owners. They are very friendly. They offer ice cream, shakes, malts, hand-stirred sodas, floats as well as sandwiches and hot dogs. We had a butter pecan ice cream cone and a chocolate malt (which was huge!) for about $8. It was really good. There's also old style glass sodas and classic candies for sale. The place is super cute, we're really glad to have this on Belmont's Main Street!

Also, my understanding is that they restored the original soda taps and ice cream dipping cabinets from the 1950s. The building is from the very early 1900s and the shop has exposed brick and wood beams. They've maintained the vintage feel, it's worth checking out for that reason alone."}
{"text":"Sweet!!! Literally and figuratively! Old fashioned soda shop with carrera marble counter, complete with sodajerks, stools and a little modern flair. Serving Tony's ice cream out of Gastonia. Malted Milkshakes, NY Egg Creams, Brown Cows, Coke Floats, Root Beer Floats, Cones, Sundaes and on and on. The best thing here though, genuine old school Orangeade bursting with fresh orange flavor. And the Cherry limeade ain't bad either (in fact it's good - very good). Not that much seating but it doesn't take long to polish off a treat from here anyway. Retro candy section plus sandwiches offered. If you pass through Belmont you have to at least stop and try the Orangeade!!! You will not be sorry!!"}
{"text":"This place is super Rad! Hand made Sodas, and great desert treats, with a friendly staff. Floats and shakes of all sorts, with a few simple food options. Feels like you're in the 60's."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Loved the sandwiches and you must try the pasta salad! Loved my root beer float!"}
