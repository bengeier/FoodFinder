{"text":"This was my first time trying a Pupusa. I shared a steak and a shrimp one. The steak was really good. The shrimp didn't have flavor. The restaurant is very decorative and clean. I ordered it take out so I'm not sure how the done in service is."}
{"text":"I love this place. My family comes here for any occasion and celebrations. Very nice atmosphere and amazing food. Love the people that work here."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this pupusas place that is very close to our job. Very spacious place, and friendly staff. Our pupusas took longer that what we expected, not sure if it was because they were making them from scratch, but it was fine. I was just not impressed by their pupusas. I ordered one with pork, beans and cheese, and mine didn't seem to have cheese or enough pork, it was mostly beans. Also the sauce and the cabbage salad you eat with the pupusas wasn't flavorful."}
{"text":"Absolutely the yummiest El Salvadoran go3od in Vegas. Best Guacamole I've ever had anywhere. What a great find."}
