{"text":"Not the easiest to find if you're just drifting along Dufferin, but it's the kind of place that rewards the traveler with a piece of mind and home-style cooking from the eastern block. Ever wondered what it would be like to have a plate of authentic perogies, or mashed potatoes with chicken Kiev? Moldova is the place that easily unites three generations under its roof for a dinner - as it is common in eastern Europe. Feeling nolstagic? Welcome home."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place five or six times so far, but only because my mother in law likes to have her birthday parties there for some reason -- I would never choose to go there on my own.  The food is alright, but not delicious, with tacky music playing loud enough to be impossible to ignore.  The service is quick, but unfriendly - the feeling is the the servers would rather be some place else on that day.  The interior is also hard to say anything positive about.  Overall, this is squarely a very average restaurant with prices just above average, and it has been that way for the last several years during which I have had the dubious pleasure of dining there.  I have no idea why anyone would choose to go there of their own will."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, service is horrible.  Got a borsh soup which was not fresh you can see it in the picture. Salad was not fresh eather, could smell that it was in the fridge for a LONG time. And in the end they gave us wrong bill! CHECK YOUR BILL! Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place, delicious food, wonderful and warm atmosphere with great service. I had grilled Seabream and it was to die for. Loved this place. Will come again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  In a dark corner off Dufferin St. in North York lies Moldova an Eastern European restaurant serving authentic Russian, Moldavian, Romanian and Ukrainian cuisine.   Inside it's dim, the windows have tints applied and have full length retractable blinds, from what I can distinguish (remember it's dim) the interior walls are light green in colour, there's tiled floors,  a wrap around bar,  lighting provided by ceiling dropped blown glass fixtures, wainscotting panels throughout,  also noticed a 12\" disco ball on the ceiling above. The space looks like it can be converted into a party room pretty easily. Music playing in the background was Russian pop.    We decided on two entrees:  1. Chicken Breast Shishkebob with mash potatoes and coleslaw  2. Chicken Tabaka (Spicy, Marinated, Cornish Hen) with coleslaw   It took the kitchen ~ 15 minutes to prepare. Upon initially tasting everything. it was all made to order. The food was served hot.    The Chicken Breast Shishkebob pieces were large and ample, pieces were almost 2\" squared in size. They were juicy and cooked very well.   I would definitely come back to have this. Simple but good. Mashed potatoes were a smooth consistency with no lumps.   The Chicken Tabaka dish was okay in comparison.  The cornish hen is split into two whole pieces and is baked. Edges are crispy. I found the hen lacked flavour,  but most disappointed of a lack of spiciness although it was mentioned in the menu that it was spicy.    The coleslaw, (a side order we both had included with our entrees) was thinly shaved cabbage with a light dressing, it was crisp and complimented the meals very nicely.  Service was fine in my books, my only interaction with our server was to  order and to ask for the bill. A pretty straight forward affair, plates were cleared when we completed our meals and the bill presented in a timely manner.   The experience we had was at Moldova was very good, especially liked the Chicken Shishkebob it was very flavorful, fresh and offered good value.  We will be back to try more authentic Eastern European dishes."}
{"text":"Quite a nice Russian/Eastern European restaurant with good portions and tasty dishes. Probably been there a dozen times. Often see familiar faces so obviously people go back and it's always a good sign."}
{"text":"There is very nostalgic atmosphere here. Back to the 80s. :) I would say it's a place with good food and not fancy interior.  But I liked food there. It's simple rustic cuisine. It's been served quickly and hot. I will definitely return there."}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible service. They actually rounded up all our items on our bill and added a service charge they couldn't tell us about when the other couple we dined with inquired about it. Their exact words were \"service charge is service charge\".   Our order: Borscht soup $4.95 Cabbage rolls $14.95 Beef trip soup $4.50 Meat pierogis $8.00  Our bill: Borscht soup $5 Cabbage rolls $15 Beef trip soup $5 Meat pierogis $8.00 Total : $32+ 13% tax + service charge = $40  My bf paid the bill before we even looked it over so they received $46.  Eat at your own risk, food is extremely bland and covered with butter (the tripe soup had a huge buttery film at the top and the pierogis were swimming in butter) and they'll put bogus charges on your final bill."}
{"text":"Wonderful Menu! Best Tripe Soup !!! Flavour was so good !   Great fast and friendly service with lots of parking."}
{"text":"If you a frequent visitor at Russian restaurants, you would probably know that most of them around GTA are banquet halls where you make a reservation a week in advance. Or you go to Yummy Market to get take out.  Moldova really fills in the niche of 'an authentic Russian to grad a bite to eat' and the only one that I know of in GTA.  Of course the key word here is 'authentic'. The food in definitely Eastern European and not every Canadian may like it, but my Russian friends approve of the quality.  The service is very honest. \"We are here because you are paying us. Smiling is not included.\" Although, I never found the service to be rude in any way."}
{"text":"Eastern European restaurant with good soups that your Slavic grandmother used to make. Every time I ate soup there it was good, salads are good, main entrees are great if you're into European food. As for me I don't enjoy them personally but my cl family did, like I said I only come here for soup.   Prices are fair, waitresses are quick and friendly, always provide water with lemon, mint. Always see families, or bigger functions here always drinking and laughing loudly. Dim lights, good layout, feels like your family dining table. Drop by if you're missing European food."}
{"text":"I come to this place every now and then just because they serve good harcho soup. Everything else I tried didn't taste good to me. I agree with other reviewers about the service - it's very slow."}
{"text":"I`ve been there and what gives them these two stars is food. But the service is bad. I think they expect you to pay for a smile from the waitres cause you`re not gonna get one for free. And the worst is mandatory tipping plus they expect yuo to tip more just asking how much you`d like to tip."}
{"text":"Eating at Moldova Restaurant, I couldn't help but wonder if the food was lacking or if it's just Moldovian cuisine that's subpar. Though I didn't especially enjoy anything I ate, it's entirely possible that everything was a superior example of the dishes they were based on.  But bad food is bad food, ultimately.  We arrived around lunchtime on a weekday and the place was sparsely populated. I ate:  Harcho (\"Spicy soup w/ meat and rice\"): This dish was easily the best of the bunch. It's a fairly bland, tomato soup-like concoction that kind of grew on me as I ate it. There aren't too many flavors going on here and the spice is almost non-existent, but it's no worse than something I'd eat out of a can.  Chebureki (\"Fried meat pie\"): This bizarre dish is essentially a very thin, underseasoned piece of meat in a pastry. It's edible, I guess. The lack of flavor is bizarre, to say the least, and I feel like the pie would've been helped by a dipping sauce of some kind.  Mamaliga (\"Corn meal w/ sour cream and feta cheese or fried meat\"): This thing left my dining companion and I scratching our heads in confusion. It's essentially a very bland, tasteless corn meal cake that's accompanied by sour cream and feta cheese (we were not given the option to choose fried meat). We both ate a few bites of this tasteless mess and gave up.  (I should also mention that the Chebureki was supposed to come with a side dish but that didn't happen. Our smile-free waitress wasn't exactly approachable, so we didn't bother asking.)"}
