{"text":"I have never had one decent experience at any franchise. Their YELP states they are open until midnight but I was showed the door at 11pm on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious if you enjoy Hakka. Dishes were plentiful and excellent. Simple place. Pretty empty for a weekday evening. But food was awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered Chilli Chicken (gravy), Chilli Beef (dry),  Chiili Prawns (dry), Manchurian Fried Rice, Pineapple Fried Rice, Chicken Balls and Lollipop Chicken.
In my opinion, the chilli chicken had just a touch too much ginger but I really enjoyed everything else.   Chilli Prawns was the best I tasted and I also enjoyed the chilli beef with the pineapple fried rice.
The order taker was very friendly and it was a pleasurable experience with a short wait time."}
{"text":"first time here.
read all the great reviews. I thought I would try it. 
terrible. 
I ordered the chicken with curry sauce.
the chicken pieces were fried before it was stir fried in the curry sauce. who does that?what the fuck.
I have never had a curry chicken dish where they fry the pieces first. it made me suspicious. maybe they were trying to hide something. 
the curry sauce was watery. it had a faint taste of curry.
I went up to pay for my bill. the male server saids it comes to 12.12. I said shouldn't it be 10 dollars plus tax. he gives me the bill. it reads 11.02.
he was trying to pull a fast one on me. he was the same oriental guy who served me.
maybe it was just the one dish I ordered. still I would not come back. shadeeeeee.
my water was never filled. the glass table tops were greasy."}
{"text":"I had never had hakka food before and was curious to try this. In the end, for me, the only thing that I thought was \"fusion\" was the pakora, which were really good. The gobi manchurian were in a very shoyu-flavored sauce, which was definitely different. Everything else to me just seemed like either Cantonese style food or Indian food (noodles were basically chow mein, fried rice was... fried rice). Service was good and prompt, though when we didn't take the tofu home the server asked us why a few times, haha. 
Not quite sure if I would go here again, but it was still good nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Went with Coworkers and ordered the Chilli Chicken. The dish came with a spring roll but the service was extremely slow and food came quite late plus they will charge you gratuity on the bill.  

They do serve halal food"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and really clean restaurant. I've gotten the chicken shwarma a couple times and it's always been good. Even been given samples of their onion salsa which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very good food, so many options! The lunch special is an unbeatable deal. I come here once a week for lunch and I'm in and out within 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Very great food at great prices. Portions are pretty huge and all the food are cooked really well. Would really recommend for the value and taste."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp when in the area.

We ordered 2 orders of the Bombay chicken which tastes okay, however clearly full of MSG to the point where you can taste it in the food. We also ordered the curry pad thai, which was pretty much inedible, very bad flavour. 

At the end of that day, the food is of poor quality and the service was slow and not friendly, so I would not return."}
{"text":"food came super quick (chili chicken)."}
{"text":"We came here after a full day of touring Niagara Falls and were staring. There were 10 of us so we ordered a ton of food - from soup, appetizers to fried rice and main entrees. Among the favorites were the chicken corn soup, chicken pakoras (yummy sauce on the side), veggie fried rice, chili chicken, hakka noodles and spicy pepper fish. Portions are decent and prices as well. The place is really clean, including the washrooms. 

The service started off great and then went down hill towards the end. We had gotten all our food and were practically done eating with 2 items still missing. When we asked for them the waitress had a bit of an attitude which persisted the rest of our time there (they lost one star here)."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! 

It's nothing fancy. It's straightforward tasty, filling food. Their prices went up a bit from last year, but it's still one of the cheapest place I've ever had. Their plate is always full. I don't think I've ever finished my plate. 

The only thing I don't like about this place is that the wait can take quite long, especially when a lot of people are around. 

We've only gone here during Saturday lunches and there are times it gets pretty busy.

I highly recommend this place if you're hungry and want a guaranteed, good food!"}
{"text":"Our new go to Hakka place!
They have great lunch specials and great menu overall!
Great service and lots of space for small to big families.

Make sure to get the chili chicken with the red and green sauce on the side....yum!"}
{"text":"This place is a must if you want to try the Hakka food, the menu although is very large it is very easy to understand. The interior of the restaurant is nice and simple, you can choose to eat-in or take-out. Now the food: it is really good, and full of flavour. I ordered chicken curry spring rolls as appetizer, the hakka masala chicken and the szcheuan beef and i really enjoyed the meals. For the kids I ordered a meal with leag and back chicken on top of fried rice which is not spicy and they loved it. Let me tell you that the portions are huge so expect to take some left overs home, as far as what you get for the price it doesn't get any better. The service wasn't the best but there was only one server for 12-14 tables and she was rushing, she was nice and brought the food fairly quickly. I recommend this place for anyone craving hakka or chinese food."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Hakka Chinese restaurant. Portions are enormous for the price, and food taste great! The staff is very friendly, and service is  quick."}
{"text":"This is probably  the best hakka place in brampton, I've been to a few but the value can't be beat, they have lunch specials for $5.95 7 days a week till 4pm! The quantity is more than enough and the food is great"}
{"text":"Really nice spot for lunch with great selection of rices noodles and dishes. Friendly service and food is always out super quick so its perfect for when you are short on time for lunch.  Try out the fish pakora, first app that really hooked me on this great lunch time spot."}
{"text":"if like Hakka style its very good and delicious i love their sauce it makes every dish taste great , Chilli chicken, Manchurian Fish its one of few best Hakka restaurant"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today as I was starving sitting at my desk wondering where all the good Hakka in Brampton is. A coworker suggested Hakka No.1, which is worryingly close to my work. I'm afraid I will be there way too often now.

The restaurant itself is of the \"no frills\" variety, which tends to signal good food. I find when a Hakka place really fancies itself up, its playing a dirty smoke and mirrors game distracting you from the food (whether quality, quantity or both). But that's just my opinion.

I walked in having never seen their menu, but knew I was going to order the Chili Chicken with sauce. That dish is the real barometer of a Hakka place and decides whether I will visit again. Their version was quite good, no complaints. It doesn't hold a candle to my local in Mississauga, but it was still yummy. Really quite a large portion, with sufficient sauce coverage on the rice. You also get a bottle of water and a spring roll, all for $5.95 plus tax. I will say, it seemed a bit heavy on the MSG though. Just a warning.

The place is obviously popular as there were at least 20 people dining in and a steady flow of take out orders. Never less than 10 people waiting to pick up, with only 2 servers handling all orders plus waiting on tables. 

Keep the food coming, I will be back! Probably sooner than I would like to admit."}
{"text":"Very good portion size you get for the money you pay. Also in a perfect industrial location for people to grab quick meals during their break or after work."}
