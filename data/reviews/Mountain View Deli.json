{"text":"I just wanted to let you all know that the phone number they have written down here is wrong. It is a law office. It apparently has been wrong for some time now because she says they receive wrong phone calls all the time asking for Mt. View Deli. The correct phone number is 570-322-6794.

However, my family has been buying their subs since I was very young. I am now 32. It was always a very special treat to have their subs for lunch or dinner. They also do  sub or wrap platters for parties. My mom got both types of platters for my 30th birthday party and they were excellent and made the day even more special. Their meat, bread, and toppings have always been of very good quality and very tasty. I didn't know that they made their own bread until now but it's always been nice and fresh. I forget what days they bake it that it's the freshest but anytime I think it tastes good enough for that day. The people there are always very friendly with fast service. I definitely will be continuing my family's tradition of treating myself there every once in a while."}
{"text":"Great Subs!  They proof and bake there own rolls and use high quality meats.  The guy that made my sub seemed to be the owner and took great pride in his work.  I had a turkey sub with everything and it was very good.  Great value!  Subs are close to 20 inches long loaded with high quality ingredients for 8.50."}
