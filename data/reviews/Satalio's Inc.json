{"text":"Satalios is a hidden gem! In fact, this is probably my favorite dive bar in Pittsburgh. My husband & I go here with another couple often, and we always have a great time! It looks like just a small bar in the front, but if you walk to the back, there is a large room with big windows & a gorgeous view of the city. There is a pool table as well.  Satalios doesn't have a kitchen, so if you're hungry, I'd do somewhere else. The drinks here are probably the cheapest on Mt Washington & you get a heavy pour! The bartenders are always incredibly friendly. The bathrooms could use a little updating, but who cares, atleast they are clean! I would certainly recommend this bar. I wish satalios would add an outdoor deck because it's the perfect spot for it!"}
{"text":"This is a cool bar with a great view in its back room.  I went here to see Palermo Stone perform here for his CD Release Party.  It comfortably fit 100 or so people and felt eventful.  They had good prices on drinks and a dark private atmosphere.  I would recommend renting this space for your party or show as a artist or band."}
{"text":"Love Satalios, the perfect neighborhood local. If you're looking for something fancy, go elsewhere. They'd probably appreciate your business regardless, but no one else will."}
{"text":"Satalio's is the best! A true hidden gem and great dive bar! One of my favorites. If you're ever on Mt. Wash, you gotta stop in. The bartenders are always friendly and welcoming. Make sure you head to the back where there are huge windows with an amazing view of the city! They also have a pool table in the back and a juke box in the front. Cheap drinks, great view, good bartenders...what more could you want!"}
{"text":"I spent some time here on a recent visit to Pittsburgh.  We stopped in after having dinner down at Station Square based on a recommendation from my brother.  Reasonable prices, great service and nice people.  When you arrive, it appears to be just a small front room, but in the back is a room with a wall of windows and an amazing view of the skyline.  It could be the perfect dive bar - the view is awesome, but it's not pretentious like some of the other establishments up on Mt. Washington."}
