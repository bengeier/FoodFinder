{"text":"Mecnhie's is a great spot for frozen yogurt and sorbet. Checkout my review of the West Island location here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/menchies-dollard-des-ormeaux#hrid:opYRfYESSyW9UZ3kzckY8w"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot for frozen yogurt. You get to sample most of the flavours before purchasing. It would be nice not to waste spoons for toppings and keep plastic tongs. It's cool thry have a party room for kids birthday parties starting at 11$/child and each child gets a bowl of froyo, activities /games, the mascot shows up- pizza can also be included for a larger price. Cool concept."}
{"text":"Finally had my first Menchies experience and I am totally in love! I love the whole concept of making your own creation and price is determined by weight. I also love the fact that you can try samples of the different flavours before you buy which is very useful as some can be a bit confusing. I intended on getting the Nutella flavour but after trying the sample, found it did not taste at all like Nutella!  I opted for a mix of vanilla and fudge flavours topped with strawberries, blackberries, pineapple, blueberries, cookie dough and m&ms. It was probably too much as I went a bit crazy with the choice so next time I would go a bit lighter. Being waffle Wednesday, I was given a complimentary waffle roll - sweet bonus! I love everything about the place, from the variety of flavours and toppings to the cute collectible spoons and tubs. The only thing I felt could have been improved is you cannot really control how much froyo comes out as when you press it, quite a large amount comes out so it ends up going to waste. Other than that, I reckon I will soon be a regular at Menchies :)"}
{"text":"Wow I'm hooked!  I've heard so much about Menchie's ever since it was on the news over a spoon issue with the language police... I'm a big fan of frozen yogourt and have been loyal to Yeh but after having discovered Menchie's I just wish there were more of 'em, downtown please! For those who say it looks like Yeh, well Menchie's has been around longer so I'm pretty sure everyone else was feeling inspired.  This froyo franchise is the real deal. They have something that other chains don't, which is brand recognition: an adorable swirly head mascot, collectible spoons, a real loyalty program (you can register card online, get free gifts on your birthday, a discount after roughly every 50$ spent) etc . They even have your favorite froyo flavored lip balm, how cool is that!  It's a bright, cheerful atmosphere with extremely helpful and friendly staff. They are extremely kid friendly, they even have a little room for you to book birthday parties in. Right as you walk in, you notice little taste tester cups for you to sample the flavors - everything is delicious, so it's a hard choice. Lots of toppings, an assortment of candy and fruits although probably more candy  to fresh fruits ratio. Many different syrups like chocolate, caramel, strawberry, honey. There's something for everyone.  I highly recommend Menchie's, it's more than just a treat, it felt like a unique experience."}
