{"text":"I was craving KFC recently and I dropped by here after work.    To beat the rush and you can get better service. 


It has a good vibe and we beat the rush since it can be busy.  After 8.  It is popular for drinking also

I got the orginal version and love the crispy skin.  

Just the other yelper it is a pub that serves good chicken.  And should not be thought of a chicken place that serves beer.  If you want good kfc chicken I go to galleria super market, I call in advance   and eat it there.  It is not that cheaper consider ing it is a 24 hour super market.      Set you back $24"}
{"text":"Xmas eve dinner at the fry!! First time here. Plain and simple...green onion boneless chicken was delicious...very tender...perfect amount of batter...green onion goes well with the fried chicken. Calamari was okay...nothing special...it came with a sweet and spicy sauce. Butter garlic fries...don't order it...it was sweet which tasted kind of weird. When I asked the waitress she said its supposed to taste like that. We didn't touch the rest of it and they didn't do anything about it. I'd come back here...but just for the chicken."}
{"text":"I get take out fried chicken from here all the time. The chicken is delicious and comes in a cute take out box which include pickled radishes and a drink"}
{"text":"When this location first opened up, the food was great. My basket of fried chicken would mainly consist of white meat. Now? It's mostly bones. 

The sauces are still pretty good, but there are better fried chicken places along Yonge St. if you want better food quality. 

The restaurant itself is quite dark and gloomy."}
{"text":"I first heard of this place from a friend and she had raved about it. Decided to check it out with my friends and we were blown away.  It's a nice little joint. Top 40 music. Nice ambience.  But the food was the highlight for us. Chicken was nicely battered, really crispy and not overcooked at all.  We had the half and half special and it was way more than we could finish. Lots of food but each piece of chicken was so delightful. Just to warn everyone though, spicy is pretty spicy so just be careful. It's a sweet and spicy sauce that creeps up on you after. We also tried the butter cheese corn and it complimented all that spice. Overall we were all happy with the service and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We were there on a Friday night. Got seated right away. Waitress was very friendly and helpful. She gave us a few suggestions as we told her it's our first time there. We ended up ordering the half and half. 

The free apps was a really nice touch - salads and corn on a mini hot pan. The wings were super crunchy and very good size. We couldn't finish everything. Waitress gave us different sauces and a big container of green onion to take home. 

Definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't get a table. They wouldn't give us a table for 6. They wouldn't even try.  We would have waited. Stupid.  Only 1 person working the entire place. Stupid again. I don't like giving my business to people who could care less about mine. If you feel the same then avoid this place. 

We went next door to Ha Ba Tang and had a good time. 

If I could have got a table in would have been happy to leave a real review."}
{"text":"Great music, great food, great price, great service as well.
Most of the food came out very fast and everything on the menu is delicious.
The wings with the green onions is amazing and goes quite well with beer.
I just wish they have more brands of beer."}
{"text":"This review isn't a condemnation of the joint. They do fried chicken pretty well here, but not necessarily better than some of their competitors in the area. They do the plain KFC with green onion well and I would recommend that.

Disappointing that the beer menu was as small as it was, and some of the beers listed weren't available. The service was painfully slow and not attentive, and they actually missed an order. We also had to wait over 45 mins for a single order of fried chicken to arrive

This place may be hard to get seating, so arrive early (or late)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 10pm. The place was 3 quarters full at the time and was seated by the window for a total of 3 people. We initially asked to be seated near the door due to the cold and have mentioned it would be a 30 minute wait. 

We took the seats by the window and wanted to order the Spicy BBQ Chicken with melted cheese and Soy Garlic Chicken and garlic fries. They mentioned they don't have garlic fries, so we decided to order the corn with cheese instead.  5 minutes pass by, one of the server came back to our table and told us they don't have the Spicy BBQ chicken with cheese. We then decided to order the green onion chicken but requested to add melted cheese, which they said they can't do that. We told them it's fine and we'll get the regular green onion with chicken. 

We noticed one of the booth was available and asked to be moved there shortly after ordering. We were in the middle of the restaurant now and noticed how the interior of the restaurant wasn't even completely finished. 

After receiving our appetizers of corn, corn with cheese and the salad, our order of Green Onion Chicken came out 20 minutes after receiving the appetizers. While half way done, we noticed we haven't received our order of Soy Garlic Chicken never came out. We asked the server if it was coming, to which they replied yes, it's on it's way. 10 more minutes pass by, we asked again and with a dumbfounded look on their face, they checked the kitchen and told us it was going to be ready soon. Another 5 minutes pass by and we never received it. 

We tried getting one of the server's attention and they just ignored us. We went up to the front of the cashier to tell them we want to cancel the Soy Garlic Chicken. I don't understand how we received our order of green onion chicken when we had to order that AFTER 5 minutes after the first initial order. 

The food was good, but the service was just terrible. I would rate the food to be 4 stars, but due to the terrible service we received, in addition to the lack of the server checking up on us, and not having the food we wanted.. this place is not worth going to. 

Save yourself the time and avoid coming here."}
{"text":"Chicken and beer. It's hard to do it wrong, but this place does it bomb. Still can't do it as well as the galleria moms chicken tho."}
{"text":"If you like KFC (Korean fried chicken), you should try this place.
If you like KFC (Kentucky fried chicken), this place will blow your mind.
The menu might be confusing, so I'll leave 2 recommendations here.  Green onion chicken tenders and chicken with spicy sauce.  Absolutely amazing! 

Only issue is this place is often packed with a long line up.   If that's the case, there are 2 other Fry's between finch and steeles on yonge."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving fried chicken and beer, this is the place I go to. The place itself is very hard to find as its in a tiny plaza (just look out for an LCBO... It's across from it). The place can get quite packed as its small and cannot seat a lot of people. Recently tried something else in addition the fried chicken and beer. Ordered the cheesy spicy bbq chicken; I really liked the sauce and how tender the chicken was. Good sized portion as well. Will be back again for more fried chicken and beer! Also, they have few side dishes (salad, radish, corn and coleslaw) they give for free."}
{"text":"I assume you would go here for the fried chicken which is what my friends and I got. We got a split combo with soju, regular fried and spicy. We should have got the boneless as the chicken had very little meat. There was only one server who did his best to cover all the tables. It was pretty busy and I don't know why they had only one person.

There are much better options on the same street."}
{"text":"The green onion original fried chicken is re~a~lly~ good. 

Service is a bit slow though. ...

Price is slightly higher than other Korean fried chicken place"}
{"text":"The service here is awful. I've been a few times but my last visit was the worst. The wait staff are young girls who seem like they have no idea what they're doing. Not only that, they are rude. We walked in and asked for a table for two. There were 5 empty tables, yet the waitress wanted to seat us in a table that was in the most crowded spot- and there was a customer using it. She kept trying to kick the woman off the table, even though the older woman said she did not want to stand (she was waiting for take-out and they had no designated seating/waiting area). The food is not bad, if you're craving it I suggest you order delivery. Oh, and it reeks of old grease in there and the place is smoky."}
{"text":"I came here during a Thursday night and the restaurant was about half filled. 

I ordered the boneless green onion chicken ($18.99 - small) due to the raving reviews, and it definitely did live up to its hype. I ordered a small which is definitely a good amount to share between two people. The chicken was juicy and nicely breaded without being too oily. I also ordered a side of garlic butter fries and they were to die for! They were a bit on the sweet side, but it's a definite must order every time I visit the Fry.

Atmosphere: 4/5 | Service: 4/5 | Price: 3/5"}
{"text":"So, SOO delicious. Probably the best fried chicken I've had. Ever. We got calamari and the fried chicken in spicy sauce (it has gochujang in it, if you're a fan). The calamari was perfect, so delicious. For the chicken, we ordered the large size of chicken for the 3 of us and there was way too much to finish, the size was a lot bigger than we thought. The chicken had this perfect crispness, and I really like eating the bony pieces, so it was great that they basically fried up a whole chicken instead of just wings and drumsticks. Of course, there were meaty pieces too. The complementary sides are super great. The chicken was slow to serve, but that's expected when they're making 'em to order. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the spicy wings! Very crispy wings and great balance on the spice.  Can't beat a beer and wings here.  Fair price.  I go after 9 weekdays and it's busy, but not crazy. Coleslaw is great too, they add a hint of dill."}
{"text":"Legit Korean fried chicken! Love their crispy chicken with spicy sauce and the cheese spicy BBQ chicken as well as their reddish. Amazing choice for party takeout."}
{"text":"A co-worker recommended this place so I went one night after getting dropped off from work.  I ordered the fried chicken that was around $17.  It came with a small cole slaw which was good, corn kernels, and I think pickled turnip ?  The fried chicken had a nice crispy coating but there was no taste.   It was pretty bland.  All I could taste was the oil from the chicken being deep fried.  Also, the place looked kind of dirty and dodgy.  Don't think I'll be coming back to The Fry anytime soon.  I'd rather have Colonel Sanders KFC."}
{"text":"So green onion chicken deserves 4 stars but doesn't make up for the fact that this place does not serve a grain of rice. Never been to a KFC place without rice and def a deal breaker for me. Many opportunities to would have  tried this place again but failed to do so merely because they don't serve rice. Baffled."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because a branch of Home of Hot Taste that was previously nearby, closed down.
Overall, the service was pleasant.  The facility itself was freezing cold so we ate with our coats on.  The complimentary corn was nice as was the corn with cheese.  However the fried chicken needed more seasoning.  We ordered it plain with sauce on the side and it was quite bland without the sauce for dipping."}
{"text":"If I'm thinking fried chicken...I'm thinking 'The Fry'. My go to for fried chicken in Toronto. Can't go wrong. Usually do a pick-up of a whole chicken, half with sauce(amazing) and other half with soy garlic. If you brave and like heat, ask for the spicy sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Gross and a waste of money and time. Garlic pram fries nasty, overpriced menu, horrible service, dirty surroundings, chicken is \"mystery meat\" style.

So many better options for fried chicken in the few blocks nearby."}
{"text":"We had fried chicken with green onion, and crispy fried chicken wings.

The green onion one has a good sauce and tons of green onions. They are fried particularly well too. Although the pieces are cut too big for my liking.

They threw in fries with the wings so that's a nice bonus. 

Butter corn side dish is delish!"}
{"text":"Great place for korean food. Fried chicken and the corn cheese is a must. Worthy of a second visit"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for some chicken and beers on the recommendations from some of my buddies. Overall the food was pretty good, we got the boneless chicken with green onion and the half/half chicken. Between the 2 dishes I would say the boneless chicken was definitely better. Maybe we got the wrong sauces for the half/half because both were very similar, we got the spicy sauce and regular sauce.

We also got the spicy rice cake and it was veryyy spicy just to my liking! If you are not accustomed to spicy I would say stay away from the spicy rice cakes.

It seems like there are more Korean restaurants that specialize in chicken and beers and I would consider coming back to The Fry if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"The service here is terribly slow. It took ages to flag down a waitress to put in our order and much longer to flag one down for the bill. The food itself wasn't outstanding and some of it was just not enjoyable.

Boneless Chicken with Green Onion (small) - 3.5/5
- best dish out of all that we ordered. Surprisingly not dry for boneless chicken. It was quite crispy and came with lots of shredded green onion on top. The only thing I have to say is that I wish it had a bit more sauce.

Fried Chicken (part of Special Half & Half) - 3/5
- this is just fried chicken. No sauce, no taste. It was very crispy, which was nice, but nothing special.

Spicy Fried Chicken (part of Special Half & Half) - 2/5
- WAY too spicy. Perhaps my friends and I just have low spice tolerance (usually I can handle medium spice at Korean restaurants), but we each took one bite and our mouths were on fire. I could taste a bit of the sweetness in the Korean spicy sauce but the burn from the spice was so overpowering, it was not enjoyable at all.

Corn with Cheese - 3/5
- This dish was alright. Not too special. Just corn on a hot plate with cheese melted on top

Garlic Butter Fries - 1/5
- did not taste like garlic butter at all. It had some strange sweet taste to it.

Overall, I don't really recommend this place. I'd go elsewhere for fried chicken."}
{"text":"There is hype I know, but it really IS THAT good!

Been here several times, and starting from the overall service, which is always super friendly, makes it a highlight for every visit, regardless if we had two people or six people.

Plenty of parking off Elmhurst street, which isn't free, but it's reasonably easy to park.

Store kept clean, though decor is very simple.

Music is all good, with a mix of Korean pop and Korean EDM?

Food! O!M!f!Chicken! How is something so simple taste so amazingly addictive. I am speaking from a \"why is this shiet $25\" perspective before eating it, to \"holy shiet we Are coming here again without having dinner next time\". It's magical.

Like all Korean establishments, there's always the free appetizers beforehand, and did I mention their fried chicken dish is amazing!?

Tip well - we unfortunately learned that a lot of customers don't tip at all, which isn't nice."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim on a Saturday at around 5pm. First things noted: no other customers in attendance besides a bike courier, bare plywood walls on one side of the restaurant, and K-Pop blaring through tinny speakers.

My girlfriend gave me the \"let's GTFO!\" eyes but I was craving that Korean fried chicken and we stayed the course. Skeptical yet intrigued, we ordered a classic fried chicken basket (not boneless) and washed up in the basement bathrooms - no paper towel on the men's side, but that's what pant legs are for.

We were treated with water and a few small appetizers (some sort of tasty slaw, cubed daikon (maybe?) and a hilarious aluminum foil-wrapped skillet filled with oily, piping hot corn niblets from a can). I scoffed at the corn and then promptly inhaled it. I was hungry and/or I have been wilfully blind to the genius that is scalding, greasy canned corn.

Then came the fried chicken and it was on POINT! It was accompanied by the house sweet chili-esque dip. The breading was impeccably crispy and thick and surprisingly light. Perhaps some sort of panko batter? As others have mentioned, all sorts of bony chicken bits are coated and fried and so some pieces have little to no meat on them; nevertheless, each piece bears plenty of disgustingly delicious crunch to whittle off with your teeth. 

Anyway, this place is clearly not perfect, but if you're after a no-frills Korean fried chicken joint in the Annex (and you don't give a flying flapjack about anything other than fried chicken), this is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken! Soy garlic was definitely my favourite. The spicy chicken is great too but the spiciness really builds up so eat with caution XD. 

Go for the beer combo if having beer at the same time. Very speedy service ;)"}
{"text":"We usually get half and half.It was really good the first time we ordered it. Speachless quality. We have only had take out from this place. Most of the time are very very good. Few times average but never to a point you think you just wasted your money."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Korean Fried Chicken in the States and so far nothing has lived up to the Bon Chon standard. I'd say The Fry is one of the better alternatives in the GTA, with good food, great flavour, but alittle pricey.

The food (4/5): I've tried 3 things here: Garlic Soy Chicken (with bones), garlic fries, and the hot & spicy chicken with cheese. Mind you, all 3 dishes are huge proportions, especially the chicken, its enough for 2 people to share. The Garlic Soy chicken comes out looking like Popeyes/KFC, bubbly yet crispy skin and moist on the inside. Flavour is great, tastes like Soy Garlic, but I was thoroughly disappointed that it wasn't cooked doubly fry style where you get a glassy crisp as the skin. Ah well! However, those garlic fries doe... I can munch on them all day. I'd highly recommend! Sweet, garlicky, with a bubbly crisp :3 The spicy BBQ chicken with cheese is alittle on the spicy side for me but I have a low spice tolerance anyways. Its pieces of chicken on a bed of onions slathered in their spicy sauce and topped with cheese. A good dish too.

The Cost (3/5): The Soy Garlic was ~$16, Garlic Fries ~$8, Spicy BBQ chicken w/ cheese ~$12 (not sure not on this one). I'd say that if you were ordering 1 dish for yourself then its a bit pricey, but as I said about the proportions are huge, so order a couple and share it between friends, it comes to a good price point per person that way.

Service (3.5/5): I came with a friend on a Friday night for dinner. The small place was packed with a constant line up for take out orders. From what I noticed there were 2 waitresses managing  the tables and the cash. I found I didn't have to wait too long to be attended too, so no complaints here. The servers were nice considering how they were being pulled in every direction.

Ambience (4/5): Place was small, and somewhat dark. It had it's own identity and I'd say it was a pretty casual and hip place to chill. Bathrooms were meh but nothing to complain about here"}
{"text":"If I hadn't paid a visit to 'The Fry', I never would've believed it to be possible for anyone to take a popular and standard dish in Western cuisine and actually improve upon it.

I have no idea what the process they're using to make the batter and to fry the chicken, but this is hands down, some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  

My friend and I ordered the Half-&-Half special (Spicy Sauce Chicken, Soy Garlic Chicken) and a side of Butter Garlic Fries.  Although deep fried, the chicken is still juicy, tender and flavourful.  The spicy sauce is at just the right level of heat; spicy enough to keep you interested, mild enough that you can still feel your taste buds.

I love the fact that it isn't conventional whole cuts of chicken (ie. leg, thigh, rib) and instead, is literally an entire chicken that's been chopped up into wing-sized pieces, battered and deep fried.  Every piece you choose is a surprise until you start eating it and realize what part of the chicken it is.

More expensive than your run-of-the-mill KFC or Popeye's, but totally worth it.  This is now my go-to place when I need to satisfy a craving for fried chicken."}
{"text":"Great chicken. We had the soy garlic and the green onion, both boneless. Appys mediocre. Grapefruit soju is dangerous ... Tastes like juice! Service a little slower. More importantly .... It is freezing out. Seriously. I think they just heat from residual kitchen heat. So bring your long underwear and a warm coat. Wools socks also recommended."}
{"text":"Flavors really on point for the chicken. However, not all pieces were \"meaty\", and some were more bone than meat. Spicy sauce was far too spicy for my liking but the chicken itself was succulent and not dry at all. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good but gets 1 star from me because of the service.
Waiters who work here are really nice but the waitresses are toatally a B*****.
Just went again yesterday ordered takeout and even tipped the waitress.
Was told it will take 15 minutes.and ended up waiting an hour.
food was ordered at 6:50 and got it at 8pm...
the waitress did not even apologize for the long wait or explain why it was so late and the other waitress didn't care.
what a nice service they have.
When I asked they just looked at me like I did something wrong hear laughing when she walks back.
Food is good but service is the worst you can get"}
{"text":"Sorry but the sauces they use here are just all wrong, taste like they came straight out of a jar.  I was hoping for real asian style fried chicken and this was just an imitation.  For the real deal unfortunately you need to go to asia or even nyc for bonchon etc. still looking here in toronto..  

The plain fried chicken was ok so just stick to that."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the highly recommended place for chicken. Location, amount compared to the price, quality of the food, service, everything is 5 stars but only reason I chose to give 4 stars is due the fact the food is a bit too salty - with beer = perfect."}
{"text":"Omg... Koreans really know how to fry their chicken! Came here on a wednesday night and it was pretty packed. Once we got in and asked for a table, she looked at me like she didn't understand what I was saying in English and walked away.. I had to request for her to put our name down on a waiting list and to call us when there was a free table while we walked around for an hour and went for drinks. Things got better when my korean speaking friends came and our requests were acknowledged. 

Lesson: go with a Korean speaking friend!

Anyway, despite all the initial troubles, the food was delicious. Highly recommend the one w green onions and the sweet and spicy one. Soooooo crispy and soooo good!! I've had a lot of fried chicken and this was the crispiest and one of the better ones. :)"}
{"text":"The service here was horrid. Walked in, place was half empty and it took forever to get seated. Then we sat for 15 mins with no water or evidence that any of the servers were going to come over so we left and went to Kinka across the street. Brutal."}
{"text":"Delicious food, okay service.

I tried Korean fried chicken (chicken with green onion [Small]) for the first time here (their specialty), and it was delicious! The chicken was well cooked, batter was crisp, and it wasn't too greasy.

My fiancée and I also ordered the Fish Cake Soup, which was perfect on that cold evening.

The food came very quickly, but the staff working there all seemed to be a bit frazzled and inexperienced. They were still kind, but I wish they would look around and spot opportunities to serve the customers more often (many people trying to flag the servers had their hands in the air for a minute or two).

The restaurant at this location is very small, borderline cramped, but is still enjoyable nonetheless.

We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Since trying Bon Chon in the States, I've been on the lookout for a great KFC restaurant. I've tried Home of Hot Taste and Ajuker, but they were simply OK and did not live up to my experience at Bon Chon. When one of my colleagues told me about The Fry, I had to give it a shot. 

My fiance and I went to the Fry on a Friday night. We ordered a half and half with soy garlic and crispy chicken, and we also ordered chicken wings with their spicy sauce (which comes with fries). The chicken was absolutely delicious!! Super crispy and fried perfectly. The sauces were pretty good as well. Fries tasted like the ones we get from Costco though.

Service was OK. Like most Korean restaurants in Toronto, there's one server for the entire restaurant. We had to call our server 3 times to get her to take our order, and then we had to ask for water 3 times because she was always too busy to bring it to us. 

Overall, I'd recommend the Fry is you're looking for good Korean fried chicken. I'd say Bon Chon is still my favorite, but this place comes close. The only thing they really need to improve on is their service."}
{"text":"Tried a couple of KFC places in Toronto and this place is hands down the best. Anyone can throw a fancy sauce on top of chicken and have it taste good. But to have chicken come out crispy and juicy with just the right amount of batter is NOT trivial. That is where the magic is and that is what makes The Fry the best. They're pretty consistent with the cook of the chicken, but sometimes their regular fried chicken can be under seasoned."}
{"text":"Dropped by with the cousins and was hit with a 20 min wait. They didn't take numbers down, they just expect you to wait. I mean in the spring and summer its all cool but when its -20 outside, its kind of ridiculous! There is no waiting room but lucky we managed to squeeze us all in the little space they had. 

We finally sat and ordered our food! We got the cheesy corn (highly recommended by fellow yelpers), half and half chicken (soy garlic and sweet&spicy), and their famous scallion chicken. 

Honestly the soy garlic and sweet&spicy was super flavourful and yummy. The scallion chicken was a bit of a let down. I felt it needed a dipping sauce. 

Overall, it was okay food and the atmosphere is fun. Very casual and somewhat loud (drunk Koreans). 

There are probably better chicken places in the area to try. 

Happy Belly!"}
{"text":"The place was terribly cold. Someone asked to turn off the air conditioner but they didn't care. We ordered the food but they brought just the food. Where are my side dishes and water? In the Fry in Steeles they gave us salad, and corn for free.  Here the excuse was \"you should order chicken\"...  WE EFFFING ordered chicken,  but they couldn't care less. How rude you should be to not bring side dishes and water? This place is terrible. I usually don't give below 15% tip,  but they were astonishing terrible. If you want the Fry food go to Steeles,  Sheppard one is a mere waste of space and money."}
{"text":"Food - 4/5 service 2/5 
I arrived with my wife and daughter around 5pm for dinner so we were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant. My wife had a craving for Korean fried chicken and this place being the closest we decided to give it a shot. 

So keep in mind we are the only ones in the restaurant at the time
Food was decent. We ordered the half original and half flavored combo which came with 4 side dishes. I enjoyed the original fried chicken which came with some sauce on the side and my wife really like their flavored chicken. The chicken was tasty with a nice mix of dark and white meat and not too many bones. Overall the food itself was enjoyable.

Service - so there was only 1 waitress at the time when we arrived and she was terrible. I understand if you're busy but being the only table you had to take care of there was no excuse. No explanation of the menu, I had to ask for water after nothing was offered for over 15 minutes, never came to ask if we needed anything, I had to get my own napkins when I needed extra. I think she spent more time working the tv then she did on us. 

I'd probably come back for takeout but that's pretty much it."}
{"text":"Came here with a reservation and waited about 10 mins. Food was alright great beer pairing food. The spicy chicken was super spicy which kinda ruined the rest of the food for me"}
{"text":"4 stars on the chicken. We had chicken in sauce, chicken with garlic, butter & garlic fries, and corn & melted cheese. Took a while for food but hey I get it. It takes time from scratch. The food was plenty and fantastic tasting but here is where I had a bit of an issue. Maybe I'm just an old fart, but the music was playing so loud my wife and I could not carry a conversation without yelling at each other. It was so ridiculously loud that we laughed about it in disbelief when the waitress was trying to take our order but she had difficulty hearing us and us hearing her. If they were not so far from my home I would do take out. Too bad because the food was awesome."}
{"text":"This place has a great Selection for Korean fried chicken. The waitress recommended their fried chicken with sweet green onions or the saucy savoury secret sauce. Really liked their boneless fried chicken with their secret savoury sauce- it was a little bit sweet like honey was in it. What was great about it was even tho it was a saucy chicken dish, it was still really crispy and the chicken wasn't dry ! 

The corn with cheese had a lot of cheese, it was a bit of a smaller app but the amount of cheese made up for it. This was perfect for sharing with 2 people 
 
Their selection for fries is great for sharing. The two of us could not finish the Bacon and cheese fries, it's a great choice for sharing with 3-4 people. The cheese was more like cheese wiz, I'm a huge fan of cheese wiz but if you're not, you might wanna go with something else .. like the garlic butter fries (it looked REALLY good).

Besides the food, the restaurant was a nice casual place to dine on a weekday. I can imagine how packed and busy it would be at night during a weekend. 4 stars because they didn't have Sapporo is a bit harsh... 4.5 stars for this spot :D they have parking spots !!"}
{"text":"My wife has been eyeing this place since it opened. I finally gave into it. She picked the half and half chicken  (half original and half secret savory sauce) with a side of cheese fries(fries with pretty much nacho cheese sauce and bacon bits). 

I would give this place a 4/5. Service is great and quick when you order on the phone, food is really good and they give you a free pop.

Fries were ok , need more nacho cheese sauce and more bacon bits.

Overall chicken is very well cooked, the secret savory sauce chicken is literally worth getting your hands dirty and with the spicy sauce ordered on the side is the best dipping sauce."}
{"text":"The location is small but cozy. If you like fried chicken, they have a lot of choices. The chicken tastes good although I've had better in the same area. Got a piece of plate (pressed would) in one of the appetizers and wasn't impressed. The waitress, although nice, didn't seem too concerned. I would give it another shot next time I crave KFC."}
{"text":"The Fry!  I get so weirdly excited about The Fry's Korean fried chicken it makes me write in exclamation marks nonstop. Nonstop! 

Open only for dinner starting at 5pm, the busiest hours are when people are ready for beers: ~7-10pm.  Korean fried chicken is made for beer and soju - something I've learned from reading their reasonably priced soju/beer + fried chicken combo menus that cost roughly $28.  Oh, and also from Korean dramas, cause those are real-life, obviously!

Picking just a basket of fried chicken, regardless of small or large, will have you starting your meal with a sizzling foil-lined cast iron skillet of corn.  I'm pretty sure it came out of a can, but whatever, the sizzly factor makes it tastier.  What is this stuff called anyway?  Loose corn?  Corn bits?  (I think what I mean is kernels). 

Batter is mixed with corn starch so it's a lighter and fluffier batter than the American style of fried chicken.  Whole, dark pieces of meat contain the bones still in, and those to me are the tastiest parts.  Sometimes not a whole lot of meat on those ones, but who cares?  The most important part is dat chicken skin! Oh, yes!  That crispy exterior is like breaking the burnt sugar layer of a creme brulee.  

The meat is moist, flavourful from keeping the bones in. I like to ask for a spicy sauce and a regular sauce on the side, so maintain the height of crispy chicken but still able to dip in the meat.  Ordering extra sauce on the side means you get less sauce in the small container plus an additional $1 per container, but I think it's a worthwhile cost to prevent soggy fried chicken.  Sogginess is fried chicken suicide!  

Green onion chicken has a minimal amount of sauce on top, but is covered with a heaping mound of shredded green onions.  I've been told that this is a popular way to eat fried chicken in Korea.  Why? I dunno, but I shovelled in mouthfuls of green onion after each chicken bite anyway.

Garlic soy sauce is my hubs' least favourite.  He says it just tastes like sweet soy sauce and it makes the chicken soggy. 

The spicy sauce is truly quite spicy, so have some drinks on handy.  Some beer or soju perhaps?

{"text":"Bomb ass fries! Their regular fries taste exactly like Costco! We ordered the cheese fries with bacon bits and quite enjoyed it, especially when you need it to cool down your mouth after some spicy chicken. The chicken was a lot spicier than I had hoped, by the end of it my nose was red and my tongue was burning. Though keep in mind I don't handle spicy well. Their regular fried chicken is pretty good. I'd suggest ordering boneless and getting the sauce on the side. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that the service wasn't great. Not as bad as downtown but still not great. Though she was the only server at the time so I understand."}
{"text":"The Fry specializes in Asian Fried Chicken, which is built based on a Korean themed restaurant. The side dishes were korean styled but the actual food that we ate were the spicy fried chicken and the garlic butter fries. The fried were really food, it blended with the cheese really well, as well as the server listening to our silly requests. Otherwise, the fried chicken tasted really good compared to other places that gave you small portions of chicken. I recommend you to come here if you want alcohol and chicken late at night, since it opens till 2ish am!"}
{"text":"I always go to the fry. I recently went to the other location north of Yonge but decided to try out this location near Sheppard. That was a total mistake! There was 5 of us today and it was really busy but we got a table pretty fast. We ordered and waited. While waiting I saw one of the waitresses go to a table and switch a customers basket of chicken as he was eating it. She said nothing and the customer looked so confused, and meanwhile I was still waiting for my order. Everyone at my table got their chicken and in less than a minute the girl who swapped the other persons chicken came back out with my food. I could tell right away that this was the same basket as the one she switched, because the chicken was all tossed around and the sesame seeds were underneath the chicken unlike every other persons basket at my table. What she did was disgusting as that guy was already eating the food she switched! I will not be going back to that location and will make sure my friends don't either."}
{"text":"Don't dine here and waste your money on half cooked fried chicken. Ordered for delivery on a Saturday night. When I got my order, one box of chicken was only half full and was very soggy. The popcorn chicken was pink on the inside. Shivers***

When I called the restaurant to enquire about my experience, the employee did not speak English and it was very tough communicating with her about the incident. 

Also, it's really over priced and the chicken was not even good. Very very disappointed !"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

We ordered the fried chicken in spicy sauce. It was few ah, crispy and juicy. The sauce was flavourful and quite spicy! Sweet potato fries were good too but that's hard to mess up. Overall, food wise it's nothing I'm rushing back for, even though I only tried 3 dishes (those 2 plus the free corn). 

The service wasn't good. We weren't upset about it, but it was EXTREMELY slow all the time. The waitress was polite, but inefficient and lacked understanding of English. 

Overall I'm indifferent about recommending this place even though the fried chicken was pretty good, and the restaurant had a cozy ambiance about it."}
{"text":"First time to The Fry! Great experience!! Two appetizers came on the house. One was the sweet corn in cheese on a barbecue hot iron plate. There's no way that I don't give a 10 out of 10. The corn was sweet and tasted so well in melted cheese. 

The second appetizer was a plate with three compartments, coleslaw salad on one end, turnip with vinegar in the middle and cabbage with thousand island dressing on the other end. All of these three kinds of salads tasted good. I especially like the turnip chunks in vinegar. They were not too sour even though they were dipped in vinegar. I thought I was eating apples chunks. So tempted to request for an encore. Another 10/10.

Ordered a pint of Pabst Blue Ribbon because it's on special. A pitcher only cost $13.99 & a pint was $4.99. It was a perfect partner with the fried chicken.

Also ordered a Half & Half Fried Chicken, half order in original fried chicken and another half in secret savoury sauce. I personally like the original fried chicken more comparatively. They were dry and in original taste. The one in secret savoury sauce made the fried chicken more sticky and too sweet to my own personal taste. I would give a 9 out of 10.

Beer and Korean Fried Chicken are a perfect match."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is delicious! I ordered the boneless fried chicken with savoury sauce and I was not disappointed, the chicken was crispy and crunchy while tender and juicy on the inside. The sauce was great, though it was a bit sickening after having too many pieces in succession.

My boyfriend got the bbq chicken with cheese, which was also good but definitely not on par with the fried chicken.

It's a bit pricey but one order is enough to fill two not so hungry people! They have combos that include alcohol as well.

Service was great considering our waitress was working all alone, she got us seated, served our food and got our bills quickly. 

Overall, I would love to visit The Fry again soon!"}
{"text":"Call ahead and order your food before arriving. And if it's Friday night. Come early or don't even bother. Food takes forever to arrive. So waiting around for a seat could take 2 hours at least. We waited well over 40 minutes after ordering and the waitress forgot our order, she came back to \"confirm our order\". It took at least an hour for our food to arrive. People around us who ordered after us received their food first. They spoke Korean, we didn't, coincidence? I think not. Chicken is good. But not worth the wait. Have a snack before coming."}
{"text":"Got a chance to try this restaurant franchise for the first time. The place was open for lunch time (starting at 12pm) and my colleagues and I decided on the large green onion with fried boneless chicken. Overall, the chicken was nicely fried with light seasoning with salt. The sliced green onions on top added a nice counter balance to the chicken meat. 

The restaurant also served hot corn kernels on a sizzling plate. We also got appetizer plate with salad, pickled radish and coleslaw. 

Went in the winter timeframe and there was like no heat ..."}
{"text":"This is my favourite chain for korean fried chicken. Fried chicken is big in Korea and until I came to the Fry, nothing came close to replicating the same quality of taste. In general, I would say the food is good but the service is rather slow and all of the branches are tiny. I also don't think they take reservations so I just try to avoid peak times. I would highly recommend the regular fried, soy garlic, and green onion chicken."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Friday night. When we went in they told us it would be 20 minutes ish wait so we left our phone number and they said they would call. I'm about 15 minutes, I got a call saying our table was ready!

We ordered the crispy fried chicken and the fish cake soup. Both were pretty good and came in pretty big portions. The two of us left very full. 

I prefer MyMy chicken not very far from the Fry, but this is a close second for me. However, just like many of these Korean chicken places it was super loud. I had to yell in order for my girlfriend to hear me basically.. also, the servers don't walk around often enough so you have to hunt them down if you're seating close to the windows."}
{"text":"Clean place, good amount of parking spots including underground. Service was okay. Food was good. Ordered the half original and half green onion and soy. Also got a side of garlic fries which are always addicting. The server was great bringing us more sides and filling up our water. All in all, I'm just glad it's a lot closer than the city locations."}
{"text":"my first time trying Korean fried chicken and I'm a huge fan - don't think I can eat Kentucky Fried Chicken or Popeyes ever again now knowing Korean style exists."}
{"text":"Finally get to try this new fried chicken place. This restaurant was busy when I got there on a Tuesday night. However, they only have 1 server at the front so taking orders take quite long. I ordered the fried chicken with special house sauce and the green onions fried chicken. They both taste good but I don't find it very special for the price I'm paying. I feel like their fried chicken are all the same just putting different sauce on top. I like the other fried chicken place better with roughly the same price. Overall, the taste is good and the service is good just really lack of server to take better care with customers aka the wait time is too long just to place order. The price is bit expensive but it's still good taste fried chicken if you are around the area and crave for that."}
{"text":"When first time I went there it was awesome for the food! Love Korean chicken with beer. But 2nd time I went there, that waitress just told us there were no more seats and NOT telling us how long should we wait for. Basically what she means it's just get out there are no more seats dude. A bit disappointed. Not sure I will go again! Good luck!"}
{"text":"Our good friends Michelle and Phil had ordered take out from The Fry for us to enjoy during our visit to their new condo (Congrats again guys!!) I've always wanted to try Korean fried chicken, especially after watching the Korean drama \"My love from the star\" 
She ordered the Korean fried chicken with spicy sauce for us. The batter on the chicken blew me away, I was expecting hard and crunchy texture (I judge it by looking at it..I'm sorry!! ), but got a light and crispy taste instead!! Almost reminded me of tempura!! So good. They got spicy sauce for us to dip in, and I thought I could handle spicy...I couldn't..I was WEAK! It was so good but I was literally dying and had to eat the coleslaw (BEST COLESLAW EVERRR) the entire time.  They had another one that was less spicy and more of a sweet and tangy taste, that became my dipping sauce of the night. Super good! 

She also ordered the corn and cheese side dish. Corn and cheese..you can never go wrong with combining those two. I loved the fried chicken...but I love the corn even more. I can't even begin to describe how FRIGGING delicious this was. Like look at those beautiful cheese strings though...So just go try it! I think I'll order one to myself next time 

I'm excited to come back to the restaurant and enjoy other fried chicken dishes...with a couple bottles of soju of course!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. My favourite Korean Fried chicken joint. However the service is pure crap. They basically take your order, drop food off, and have to be chased down. The restaurant is big enough for 40 people and SO EASY TO CHECK ON YOUR PATRONS. But the servers just chat behind the desk. 

Only thing keeping me coming back is the deliciousness of the food. Boneless green onion chicken with garlic fries and pitcher of Sapporo! Can't go wrong ;)"}
{"text":"Everything is exceptional about this place. The quality of the food, portions, and value for money. I've been here about 10 times and every single time I'm hungry for more and looking forward to the next time! What I always get: Boneless green onion chicken, spicy rice cake dish, garlic fries. These are all easily shareable, so ask about the portions before putting in your order!  Only criticism about The Fry is that it is FREAKIN' COLD in the winter! They need to turn the heat on, and its like that during every visit in the cold months. 

Also, the staff should probably come around more often. They aren't hard to flag down, considering the cash desk is super close, but as a part of their service mandate, they should definitely come around more often.

Value here is really awesome for what you pay compared to other popular places like MyMy Chicken. This is much cheaper, with incredibly tasty food."}
{"text":"Mouthwatering fried kitchen! Yum! Breading and seasoning is great and very fresh! Just wish they were a bit faster during late evenings. I always crave their fried chicken every time I'm in the area. Price is decent, they need more locations in the west side!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Crispy chicken (C3) and the secret savoury sauce chicken (C11) along with Garlic butter fries. We also asked for a side of the spicy sauce which is a must try here. The crispy chicken was very crispy and not oily at all. All chicken dinners come with 4 complimentary sides (pickled veggies, salad with aioli sauce, coleslaw and corn) the corn & pickled veggies were our favourite. We definitely underestimated their portion sizes and over-ordered lol but hey, Take-out! The ambience is nice and chill as well and doesn't feel like you're in Sauga, it's the downtown vibe. All in all it came up to $80+tax"}
{"text":"Boneless chicken with green onion is amazing! Nice sauce and veggie combo. The crispy fried chicken was nothing to write home about, would opt for a more flavourful option next time. 
The large portions are massive. One may be sufficient between 3 people. I felt like I was living in an episode of Let's Eat. 

The garlic butter fries were...what the heck were they. I am a HUGE fry lover and I actually did not want to eat these. They tasted neither like garlic or butter. Super sweet and was like crispy cake, so bizarre. Now as I am reading others' reviews, seems like our batch got messed up in the process. 

Ordering take-out was easy. The girl warned me that they're really busy and that the wait was going to be 20-30 mins, which was fine. She sounded really sad when I said I wanted to order anyways. Takeaway boxes were sturdy and easy to carry."}
{"text":"Went there around 9pm and got denied by the waitress saying there's no more room. All the tables were taken but there weren't any line ups. She didn't even bother to tell us to wait for the next available table and the place closes at 1:30AM"}
{"text":"The yogurt soju is interesting! Not as strong as original soju, taste sweet and sour! Hahhah love it! We had cheese corn, fried sweet potato(recommend this one!) and garlic fried chicken! All good! They also serve salad, kimchi radish and butter corn for free! But a little bit pricey... however, worth a try!"}
{"text":"Nothing special or memorable.  The basic fried chicken is a little bit on the dry side.  Also tried the spicy sauce, which was much more sweet than it was spicy.  Compared to other Korean fried chicken, say at Momofuku, it lacked complexity in flavour.  At nearly $30 for the order, I would have preferred a smaller quantity with better quality.  Crispy fries were good, but at $8, a bit on the outrageous side. 

Not too much to note on service as I took takeout.  Just that there was general confusion about what to do when I came by to pick up my order and that it took an extra ten minutes from the promised time.  But meh.  Not the end of the world."}
{"text":"I love Korean fried chicken overall, but would ask everyone to stay away from this The Fry location.

I went with a group of 11 and we were told right off the bat there's 15% automatic charge in tips due to the large group. Thats fine with me but I was surprised given it's an Asian restaurant, this generally doesn't apply or happen. Meh.

Our group was split up into two tables - one of four and the latter of seven. We (larger table) ordered the green onion chicken (large) and soy garlic chicken (large). Food wise, it was just right and filling. I liked the green onion one a lot! It works best if you grab a piece, then place some sauced onion on top. Yummy! As for the soy sauce one, I found it alright - just like any other fried chicken. They also gave us a plate of sweet corn in cheese as Korean appetizer for all customers prior to our orders. It was pretty tasty.

Aside from their food, the poor customer experience is what   made me grumpy. It kicked in shortly after we arrived and throughout our meal. This store is deep with the kitchen at the far back. We were sat closer to the door. What ticked me off is the lack of attention to our big group. The waitresses never came by our tables unless we flagged them. Secondly, as a table of seven, they only gave us one bottle of water. The water was gone in four cups, yet they would never come by to refill or check on us. Every time we had to wave them down and doing that was tough too.

It may also be lack of staff but the waitresses would go around to those tables closer to the kitchen. Overall, I don't like the service and would not come back. I'd rather go to the one along Yonge. Why would I pay 15% tips when service was not even on par."}
{"text":"I've visited the fry twice so far, it's a small Korean pub style restaurant in the Yonge and Sheppard area. Not the biggest place but always seems to be fairly busy. Personally I'm not sure why as I've found it be below par. The food is very very pricey for what seems like no frills meals but for some reason most Korean fried chicken places charge a lot of money for what is very simple fried chicken. The menu is not very large and I've found the staff to be a little on the cold/ unprofessionally curt side when I went here. Ambiance is standard bar feel but due to the size it tends to be very noisy and hard to converse. The crowds are not too mixed so it has a very ktown vibe."}
{"text":"I've already been here twice. I enjoyed their original fried chicken. The batter tasted really good but the chicken needed more salt. We usually order half chicken for two people. It comes with 4 sides. The corn (comes as a side with the chicken) is delicious. The spicy rice cake wasn't very good. We also had fried chicken with spicy sauce which is a good choice too. The fry is also open till very late which is convenient."}
{"text":"Came with a group and got to try a few things off the menu! I believe we got some sort of a combo that gave us 2 sides and a pitcher of beer for $27ish dollars if I recall correctly. We ordered the seafood cream sauce rice cake, cheese corn, soy and green onion chicken and a spicy fry special sauce chicken. 

I will begin with the special sauce chicken. I have a moderate-low tolerance for spice as a reference. Upon my first bite of the spicy chicken, I thought \"O this tastes delicious. It's sweet and not spicy at all.\" Then it hit me full force after my five seconds of enjoyment. My lips, mouth and throat were burning and my eyes were watering. But it was strange because I still really wanted to finish the chicken amidst that pain because it was genuinely yummy. After a trudged my way through that piece of chicken a friend of mine said i had a look on my face that said \"what am I doing with my life\". I think I'll take it easy and just get something non-spicy next time. Or bring a gallon of milk. [They also give you free plate of assorted salad and pickled radish which helped cut the spice a little but not significantly. They do refills of this though which is great!]

The soy and green onion chicken was a welcome dish to my burning palate. It was a good amount of crunch, not over battered, juicy, and well marinated/seasoned. Will get again next time.

The cheese corn was exactly as it sounds. You can't really mess that up. The seafood cream sauce rice cake was great. Especially good for people who want to try rice cake but can't handle the spice of ddukbokki (spicy rice cake). Ample seafood in the dish as well. There's a lot of empty mussel shells, but you just have to fish for the meat that's fallen out

Overall, great place to chill with small group of friends over some beer and some food.

TIP: they can only split bills 4 ways! Something to keep in mind if going with a group."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and the Half and half were really good and cooked to perfection.  I have to say it's way better than KFC and popeyes combined. I did take out for order and the packaging was amazing. 
pricing wise it was more expensive than I would have like to pay for fried chicken."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place due to many good recommendations, so we decided to order 2 items for takeout. It took a good 45 mins to receive the 2 items.
We took original and spicy chicken. It was good, but nothing special about it. The chicken was tender, but it was not worth the hype."}
{"text":"I live in the area so have gotten take-out from this location of the Fry two times. Their chicken was ok - nothing special and not worth the hype. Personally, I prefer the made-to-order Mom's fried chicken a lot more. The one made by the Fry is more greasy, less crispy and pricier.

This weekend, my family went to the restaurant to try eat-in. As many other people on Yelp have already alluded to, service is lacking and the waitress were, I hate to say it, but downright rude. With so many options in the area with good food and nice service, we will not be back or getting take-out from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The legit KFC (Korean fried chicken)! This location is quite small with usually one person to manage the tables and cash. It's really laid back and music isn't blasting. I come here often because I live close and the chicken is perfectly crispy and tender. I enjoy the simpler option of the fried chicken with green onions. Gotta definitely eat the chicken with the pickled radish - Korean thing - to balance it out or else you'll feel greasy? (All fried stuff do it). Staff is pretty friendly and it is relatively kept clean. I don't have any complaints for this place. 

Ps if you cannot find parking at the front then there is a bigger lot behind the building. Just be careful going to the back because it is a narrow path."}
{"text":"Loved Loved Loved our waiter Yun Han!!! Made me and my friend's night so fun and enjoyable and the food tonight was PERFECT! 

The chicken was perfectly crisy and juicy on the inside like it should be and the garlic fries were so fucking good. They were piping hot and crispy with the delicious grated cheese over it??? YES! WIN! Now I'm ALWAYS going to order this with our chicken and would definately recommend the Garlic Fries to everyone!

We also ordered a Sapporo, Heineken, and Stella and our waiter was so entertaining! Thank you so much and I hope to see him again hahah~"}
{"text":"To be honest, I haven't tried the chicken here because it seems the reception girl doesn't want me to have the chance. I called at 5:30pm to place an order for a pickup at 8:30. The girl who answered my call refused to take this order and asked me to call her back at 8pm to remind her otherwise it will be too confusing! I'm not sure whether the owner trains the employee to receive orders this way or the owner has no idea the staff is working like this. Anyways, there're many Korean fried chicken restaurants in this area. My friends and I will never visit The Fry given this kind of customer service."}
{"text":"Paying 15.99 for a basket of 10 fried chicken pieces. Every fried chicken order comes with buttered corn and 3 other complimentary appetizers. 

For that price I'm expecting juicy pieces. The skin was over fried and the meat was super dried. I couldn't even finish past 3 pieces. 


I do not recommend this place.if you wanna eat fried chicken, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The garlic Parmesan is the best! I never had something like this before. It was sweet, buttery and garlicky. 
The chicken was decent, the chicken was a little dry to me even the sauce couldn't help it

Overall, 3 stars because the garlic Parmesan fries was good"}
{"text":"Come on a Saturday night. My third time going to The Fry and this time was the best.
Ordered half chicken with special Korean sauce. The chicken was moist and tender and the sauce added a good taste to it. The server came with side order of corn, radish and cabbage with Sriracha mayo on it. The side order complement the yummy chicken. 
5 stars because it satisfied my fried chicken craving and I usually don't like white meat but they made it really moist and tender so I'm impressed."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying that I LOVE fried chicken.  I love all kinds of fried chicken from popeyes to taiwanese popcorn chicken.  So I was pretty excited to try Korean fried chicken especially after reading all the glowing reviews on yelp.  

We went on a Friday night around 9pm so it was pretty busy but we were able to get seated almost right away.  The server put down the menus and literally came back 30 seconds later to see if we were ready to order.  Um... no. I hate feeling rushed when I'm out eating.  We decided to split a large order of two flavours - the original and the soy garlic.  I think a large order is a whole chicken.  So the original was just okay.  The batter is very light and honestly it doesn't taste like they put any spices in the batter.  The soy garlic while more flavourful was a little sweet.  I would seriously just stick to popeyes.  Way more flavourful and the chicken more moist.  This was disappointing."}
{"text":"Great Fried Chicken! Light and crispy!

Came here with a friend to try their Korean fried chicken, I'm new to this. Order the Soy Garlic fried chicken. It was really tasty, full of flavour. The batter was light and fluffy and didn't give me that gross feeling when I eat KFC. They also fry different parts of the chicken, breasts, thighs, wings and cut them up into small pieces so it's easy to eat. 

However, if you don't eat spicy food there are not that many choices on the menu. I did try their egg roll and corn cheese. The egg roll is exactly what the name says it is, it's like scrambled eggs pan fried to a flat sheet and rolled up. There might have been something inside maybe a bit of meat? But not noticeable. They put this ketchup-like sauce on top, which gives it a tomato flavour. This dish was a bit plain to me, not that exciting. The corn cheese was a bit weird to me. It was tasty but it is basically some frozen corn on a hot plate with some cheese. 

This place is also notorious for the bad service! I have been here once before and waited a long time and was not seated. The waitress don't really pay attention to the people when they are trying to get her attention. Simple stuff like if customers sat for a long time you should go over and see if they are ready to order, you should ask if they want something to drink, you should know your menu well enough to explain each item, also after people ask for the bill you should go back to get them change or process credit card payments etc. They obviously had zero training to be in the food service industry. So I will take off a star. Therefore come for great Fried Chicken and Zero service!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but this has been the worst service I've experienced in a while. There were only two waitresses on a Friday night - both EXTREMELY inattentive. We had to wave them down multiple times when we wanted to order, get some water, get water refills, and get take out boxes. I also saw one of the waitresses drop some napkins onto the floor, pick them up and put them back on a dining table."}
{"text":"Great service especially if you bring a Korean-speaking friend.     We ordered a combo of half chicken - Spicy fried chicken and soy garlic chicken.   We also had the delicious green onion boneless chicken.  Definitely recommend the green onion chicken. 

They also serve an appetitizer of pickled radish, lettuce and coleslaw.  Overall their chicken is crispy and flavoured.   You'll definitely feel the heat as you eat more of the Spicy chicken.   The serving sizes are large.  This place is well worth a try!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you that it was my first time.trying Korean fried chicken! Definitely worth it after hitting the gym haha

Although this is great for groups, my group was unreasonably large (10 peeps). Luckily for us, no one was in the restaurant so we were seated right away! I guess this is more of a late night snack kinda deal rather than a sit in dinner place. Despite how loud we were, our server was super nice and all smiles the whole time. Everything was served in a timely manner, no problem with the service at all.

With your order, you get a plate of three sides--there was a variety of pickled veggies. I assume they are supposed to be eaten along with the chicken to clear your palate but they were so salty that it didn't complement the already salty meat. Not my kind of side.

We tried quite a few different flavours: half and half (original and spicy special sauce), half and half (original and special sauce), and a large green onion fried chicken. Although fried, the meat is quite tender on the inside and still moist. One thing that gets me is dry fried chicken, so props to them for doing it right!

My personal favourite was the spicy special sauce with the green onion being my second. The sauce is not actually that spicy but it's certainly there for the flavour. The green onion was basically original but topped with a mound of sliced green onion. You'd think that there's nothing special but it really makes a difference! They must have slightly fried the onion in some oil or something cuz it definitely tastes better than raw ones haha.

This place is best for groups of around 4-6 as all the dishes are meant to be shared. Beware that the bill can only be split by 4, so either bring cash so that all of you can pay or pair up with a buddy to pay (hey, that's what etransfers are for). 

Overall, I'd definitely go again just for more chicken! Too bad I can't just go by myself!"}
{"text":"Bad service.

waitress forgot the  radish ,sauce, chopstick...

How can i give them 5 star.

Food also not good."}
{"text":"I visit at least a month with a buddy because yonge-sheppard area didnt really have a good Asian place and especially Korean Asian style fried chickens.

If you havent been to Asian (especially Korean) pubs, they have what is called a combo. Basically it is a package deal where you get five beers+food or replace beer with soju. The kind of food you select depends on how much more you pay (more you pay, more expensive menu obviously). If you are going with friends, definitely a combo will do cost savings but you can also order individually as some of the menus are not a part of a combo.

Food is great, no doubt. I do have to comment on waitresses however as their level of friendliness somehow is very inconsistent; some are nice, some are really cold with no replies but a short nod with no smiles. 

The place is also fairly loud with audio, so please be aware if you are looking for a quiet place(it is not a con by the way).

In overall, I still go often and you wont regret, but I put 3 instead of 4 stars hoping they improve their service consistency."}
{"text":"Came here with some expectation and ended up leaving feeling unsatisfied. Ordered spicy boneless fried chicken which was $16.99 (overpriced) and garlic butter fries(that tasted odd). Definitely not worth a trip, unless you want mediocre chicken drenched in regular spicy sauce and weird tasting fries, but at the same time overpay for the food that'll leave you questioning your decisions."}
{"text":"The restaurant is cramped. The food was okay but not spectacular. The servers were too few but efficient."}
{"text":"The food is nothing spectacular but decent enough. The restaurant is spacious enough that you don't feel cramped. Good enough place for a night out with friends. But don't expect spectacular service. Usually have too few servers."}
{"text":"This was my first Korean fried chicken experience in Toronto and it definitely did not disappoint! My friends and I wanted a pre game spot before we head out to drink. So why not get some fried chicken & beer to get the night started?

If you've got a large group like we had (7 people), get the large sizes of both the Original chicken and the Green Onion chicken. They're great for sharing... and lining your stomach before a night out of drinking. 

The meal also comes with a few Korean side dishes, some of them being crispy fish, potato salad, and pickled radish (my absolute fave, as its acidity cuts through the saltiness of the chicken).

The staff was friendly and accommodating, despite the time we had to follow up twice for our water.

My tips: Order a cold pitcher of Sapporo to go with your chicken and say \"Kampai!\""}
{"text":"Decent fried chicken, but the menu can be a little confusing for people not well versed in the Korean language. My friend and I ordered one of the combo, and the server wasn't able to fully explain to us what was included. Oh well, I guess sometimes you just have to take a chance. At least the chicken was pretty good!"}

Onion fried chicken is the best!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the half and half - half original and half sweet saucy chicken $28.99 - the chicken comes with sides of corn, radish, lettuce and coleslaw.
 
The chicken was good, crunchy, seasoned well and tasted how fried chicken would taste. The seasoning is simple just salt. The sweet saucy chicken taste like thai sweet chili heat (minis the chili heat). 

The fishcake soup was a simple clear broth with mounts of fishcake ($16.99) - quite expensive in my opinion for what it was (the fishcakes were the korean frozen ones you get at any supermarket that are used for hot pot). 

Overall I would just say this place is 'ok' - I guess if you were looking for chicken and beer, this is the place? It's dimly lit and looks run down on purpose to give it that 'underground' feel."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!! We ordered spicy rice cake and half of chicken. The chicken came out about 20 minutes but spicy rice cake didn't come out about 40 minutes. So i asked one of the servers and she forgot to order the rice cake so we waited another 20 min.
but the chiefs forgot to add extra noodles and cheese. Me and my boyfriend were about to explode and die out of hunger (the chicken was half) and we waited another 10 min. GUESS WHAT. There was small piece of fried chicken inside of spicy rice cake. Disgusting. Never ever going back again.

{"text":"Their main feature is their fried chicken. They have other sides and soups if you want to try those. Lots of drink options to choose from, including soju, plum wine, and beers.

Place gets busy. There was a large line forming at the door.
They had only two waitresses working, so things can get hectic since they're constantly walking back and forth between clearing tables, checking up on the line, handling pick-up orders, attending to customers, etc.

We got a large order of green onion fried chicken (with bones), and a small order of crispy chicken (for size comparison)

A plate of side-dishes and a hot plate of corn came out as we waited for the chicken.

5 or 10 minutes later the chicken arrives. The large order is pretty large. They say that it is good for 2 people, maybe 3, and that's about right depending on how much you eat. The small order is good for one person, possibly two.

Skins were crisp. Meats were tender.
Green onion fried chicken comes with sauce drizzled over it and a stack of green onions on top.

Crispy chicken came with sauce on the side. Sauce was a bit sweet, so might have been plum sauce, don't know. The chicken itself had extra batter and wasn't drenched over it, which I suppose is what makes it \"more crispy\" than the other offerings.

Enjoyed the fried chicken. Good for groups, but line-ups may get crazy.
You might choose to just place an order for pick-up and watch everyone look at your box of chicken on your way out."}
{"text":"Korean hang out spot!

Loved the fry! It's simply casual hang out spot for Korean authentic chicken. Fried chicken in Korea is big on variety and the fry certainly has that. I also got the yogurt drink which was great and honestly easy to make for oneself too. The chicken was fresh and crispy and the batter was not to thick. Absolutely loved the texture."}
{"text":"The food here probably deserves a solid 4 stars from me but as other Yelpers have attested to, the service is what really drags this restaurant down.

As a party of 4, we ordered a large plate of boneless green onion fried chicken as well as a half and half order of fried chicken in sauce and regular fried chicken. It was plenty enough food for the 4 of us and the chicken was great! Fried to a crisp and crunchy coating, the meat was overall fairly tender and juicy. The sauce that came with the green onion was delicious and complemented the fresh flavour of the green onions well. The sauce from the \"fried chicken in sauce\" was too vinegary for my likings but I could understand if other people enjoyed that taste. The regular fried chicken came with a sweet and sour sauce on the side, which was also great.

The problem with the service is that they seem to be understaffed, inattentive, and forgetful. When we arrived, there were 3 tables empty but we still had to wait about 10 minutes because all 3 were still covered in the mess of its previous guests. Throughout the meal, we had to ask for plates (which took a while to come) and then new plates (because the ones they gave us were dirty), chopsticks (because they assumed we needed forks), and a refill of water (which never came so I had to ask again). The waitresses weren't outwardly rude but I did feel a vibe that they didn't really want to serve us. 

Is this the best Korean fried chicken I've ever had? No. Is it the only place within this area that offers it? Probably. I wouldn't mind coming back but I'd have to mentally prepare myself to compromise my needs for good service."}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered half and half chicken (regular and one coated in a sweet spicy-ish sauce), dukbukki, and garlic fries around 5ish on a weekday. We were given 4 side dishes: coleslaw, thinly sliced cabbage in some spicy mayo sauce(?), pickled radish, and cheese corn.

The chicken was delicious. With a thick and crispy batter on the outside coating, the chicken was super tender and juicy on the inside. The chicken might seem cold because the restaurant itself is pretty chilly but it is fried to order.

The dukbukki was the highlight of the meal. I thought it was delicious, had an abundance of fish  and rice cake. However, it is definitely on the pricier end compared to other Korean restaurants' prices.

I read in a previous review that their garlic fries were amazing so I was very excited to try them. The crispy fries were sprinkled with some garlic powder mixture on the top... and it was very VERY *SWEET*. This definitely caught me off by surprise. I did not enjoy these fries because I was expecting something more savoury such as some salty garlic-y fries so I am rounding down on this one. 

The Fry could definitely improve in their size portions. I also would have liked if they indicated on the menu if the fries were sweet. Service was good. They also had no problem splitting the bill for us."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, which is probably telling for how I feel about the food :)

My favourite menu item is definitely the green onion fried chicken. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! I tried the ones with sauce as well, but it was too saucy for my taste (bordering on soggy depending on how slow you eat?). Portions are huge - I've been overly ambitious each time.

It's quite small and dark inside, but I've always been able to get a table right when I walk in. The servers are great. Bathrooms could be nicer."}
{"text":"The chicken here is pretty good. Came in a large group (10 ppl) and we ordered large sizes of the (1) boneless chicken with green onion, (2) fried chicken in spicy sauce, (3) fried chicken in sauce, and (4) garlic butter fries. 

My favourite item of the evening was the fried chicken in sauce. I found that this one had the right amount of flavouring, whereas green onion one was sparce on seasoning, and the spicy one was way spicy. The overall texure of the chicken was nice, with crispy breading and tender chicken. Garlic butter fries weren't my thing - they had a good texture (crispy outside), but they had a sweet taste which was weird. As for the appetizers, the lettuce salad was average, but I enjoyed the coleslaw and the cubes of pickled something (not sure what it was). The corn kernels on the pan were awesome!

We were seated near the door, and we were cold for most of the time, because the door was left open whenever anyone exited or entered. Someone from our group had to keep getting up to shut the door.

Best thing about the meal? Came out to about $12 per person, including tax and tip. Good place to go for groups. Also good service."}
{"text":"After going to NYC and having Korean fried chicken there only last weekend and loving it I had to find a local place that could give me that experience or hopefully even surpass it.  

I had found the Fry on Yelp of course as one of the places that serves Korean fried chicken and considering it basically makes up a majority of the menu I thought I would give this place a go.

I had ordered garlic fries, cheese corn and a half and half order of chicken which is a choice of 2 styles.  I ended up asking for garlic soy and spicy sauced.  

IN NYC:  We had garlic soy and hot and spicy in NYC but the hot wasn't sauced... hard to explain really the chicken was sort of coated with light batter but the batter was so sublime it was almost as if it was part of the skin and so crispy.  I had ordered only wings as they had the option for ordering wings, boneless breast, drumsticks etc. 

The Fry:  The chicken is basically what equates to 2 chickens cut up in pieces that are about evenly sized.  The only two recognizable pieces are your wings (flat and drumlets) and drumsticks.  The rest are basically cut up pieces of what seems to be the rest whether side, center breasts or thighs etc.

The Fry's batter is thick, so much that you can't really tell what the non wing/drum pieces are.  The chicken itself is tasty but the saucy version was really wet.  The sauce is not really hot but more of a sweet chili sauce but it seems sort of runny, not very thick yet the pieces stayed pretty crispy.

I preferred the garlic soy pieces because generally I like dry vs sauced.  The reason I ordered the sauced is because they didn't seem to have a hot - dry version but it was still ok.  

The fries were ok, nothing amazing but just average.  The garlic flavor on them tasted strange almost sweet when I'm expecting savory.  The chicken overall was good but I'm afraid to say not nearly as good as the version I had in NYC - not even close...  

Now it may not be fair that I'm comparing this place to what I had in NYC but I'm going in without the expectation that it's going to be not as good.  I'm hoping I can find better than what we had in NYC because I can't go there as often as I can go to a place in the GTA obviously.  So... I think it's fair because I'm going in with an open mind and trying it here but for me every Korean chicken place I try will forever be benchmarked by my experience in NYC because that is why I'm trying to find the same if not better now at home.  Can I do it?  I hope so but not this time around unfortunately.

Overall the experience here was ok.  The server seemed really busy as it seemed she was essentially alone to tend to the entire restaurant with about 10 or so tables and the place was full.  The food was good but not great.  Was it good enough to return?  I'd like to try other things they have but the sides were nothing to write home about and the chicken was about par."}
{"text":"The waitresses here are pretty(yay) however the chicken can really go off sometimes. In my experience it's about 30% to get the bad food.
Do not get soy garlic(i think its this, something with soy). I presonally felt it was waste of money getting it."}
{"text":"With a name like \"The Fry\", I never realized this was a Korean fried chicken (KFC) + beer place until a Korean friend told me. The sign doesn't give anything away. I originally thought this was a Chinese stir-fry place. 

Anyways, I'm glad I came here. This is as Korean as a place can get in the GTA for a non-traditional food place. It's basically a Korean pub that focuses on fried chicken and beer. If you're not here for chicken and beer, you should go somewhere else.

The food: 
-Instead of side dishes, you'll get white radish which good for combating spicy and greasy tastes common in KFC. Along with radish, there's dressed lettuce, baked corn, and macaroni in mustard sauce. 
-You have a range of chicken to choose from: onion chicken, sauce chicken, soy sauce chicken, or just regular. You can also mix (ban ban chicken). 
-They have a few non-chicken items on the menu but don't expect too much. I already forgot what they were. 

The prices are acceptable. You're looking at ~$15 per person for a meal portion and maybe more if you want beer. 

The atmosphere is your typical pub atmosphere. It's pretty dark, and there's music in the background. Nearly everyone is Korean. Don't worry, there's English on the menu. Everyone's talking loudly. This is definitely a place to hang out with friends. It's a pretty niche place. I don't get fried chicken cravings easily so I'd only come here if dragged by a friend."}
{"text":"3.5 star 
small place with free parking. We got the half and half special , one with the soy sauce seasoning and the other with sauce. Very crispy and lots of meat, subtle seasoning for the soy sauce chicken makes it great, the sauce just makes the crispy wings soggy. I like how it comes with side dishes to wash away the greasiness of the chicken. We wanted to try the chicken with green onions but the half and half special portion was more than enough for my friend and I"}
{"text":"the food is good but the service is not good.
Took forever to get my food...
Although the chicken was really tasty, I don't think it is worth the money."}
{"text":"Delicious fried chicken!! The crispiness is just right, and there is just the right amount of sauce. I know some people experienced some oily corn, but the one I got was not oily at all. The spicy fried chicken is quite spicy for people that don't normally eat spicy, so be mindful of that! The only bad thing was the service was kind of slow because there's only one waitress for the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of fried chicken but that all changed the day I came to The Fry for dinner. We showed up on a Saturday night so the place was packed and there was a one hour wait.

However, the food was definitely worth the wait and they also provided many free side dishes. I especially loved the pickled radish cubes which were delicious.

I ordered the boneless fried chicken in sauce and found the chicken to be very tender and crispy. The one thing I hate is dry chicken but this chicken was cooked perfectly. The sauce was also very flavourful and I liked how generous they were with the portions!

I also tried their homemade grapefruit soju which was an unexpected delight. It was very fruity and refreshing. 

I highly recommend coming to The Fry whenever you're craving some good fried chicken; I know I'll be!"}
{"text":"We chose the Boneless version of the Green Onion Chicken so every bite was nice to eat. It was interesting to have the green onion slivers on top of the pile. You could eat it with the chicken. I liked it since it was a blander flavour."}
{"text":"I got the special half and half chicken to go from this place with original sauce and spicy sauce. It came with a really nice cardboard box for take out and a can of coke.

The chicken was very tasty but I could tell the difference between original and spicy? The spicy was not spicy at all. In addition, I find the place a bit too pricey for what you get. All in all, I would only go if I had a coupon."}
{"text":"Now while I've been to the Fry near Finch and Yonge (I have to specify where in North York because there's another near Sheppard and Yonge) this place seems a lot more spacious and accommodating.  

Now while I've personally had some pretty poor service at a few Korean fried chicken places (*cough Dakogi, Home of Hot Taste*) this one thankfully doesn't go into infamous slot.

I had attempted to make reservations earlier in the week for 8 but life happens and some people couldn't make it after all so it was going to be a party of 4 only.  Since the place doesn't open till 5 I couldn't update them until about an hour beforehand because I was on my way down there (subway).  I actually popped in to let the server know it would only be 4 at 7pm and she was cool with it.

We received a tri-plate of typical KFC complimentary appetizers including daikon radish, cole slaw and something else as well as hot corn (without cheese) on a sizzling plate.  

The four of us ended up order 2 orders of half and half in which there are 4 different ways they serve it for this option so we ended up taking all 4 options (original, sauced - sweet/sour, garlic/soy and spicy sauced).  We ended up getting a side of fries as well as a pitcher of domestic beer.

The chicken took a while to come but when it did it all came out at once.  It was steaming hot, fresh and it took up all the table.  Each basket is a half chicken, cut up into a variety of somewhat recognizable pieces and each flavor served it it's own basket.  

The chicken is good kind of how I remember the one in North York I went to but I still think Cheers near Yonge and Finch and K-Pop are probably better.  This place is a decent option though.  They have a good variety to choose from and the service is not horrible."}
{"text":"We ordered the boneless chicken with green onion combo with yogurt soju, dokbogi (spicy rice cake and fish cake)and egg roll.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The rice cake had a lot of veggies and the portion is quite large even though it didn't seem that way with the plate they served it in.  The egg roll was tender.  It tasted like a green onion omelette.  The yogurt soju was what I was after.  The soju wasn't very strong but the yogurt (Korean probiotic drink) was definitely the key.  

The way that the dishes are portioned, in my opinion, is more suitable for parties and gatherings than to eat there alone."}
{"text":"Good fried chicken.  
We ordered the boneless fried chicken with green onions (S),  fried chicken in spicy sauce (S), and fries (Costco like fries!). The Fry on the chicken is good and crispy. Not overly battered which is nice. I found the boneless dish a bit dry, as it was only drizzled with a sauce. The spicy was indeed spicy. Portions were more than enough for 3 people. Overall it was ok,  standard fried chicken. Should I have a craving and in the area I'd come back. But there are other places to go to for really good fried chicken."}
{"text":"Many Elites seem to like the chicken here. Some are describing it as the best KFC in town! I guess I'm one of the few who didn't like it.

We ordered half & half whole chicken ($27.99) which came with few appetizers (pictures below). Choices of sauces for half & half were plain, mild, spicy, and garlic soy. We picked mild and garlic soy. Garlic soy tasted like plain chicken. I didn't feel the garlic or the soy sauce. Mild sauce was way too mild. Service was OK. Place was loud and crowded for a Thursday night.

2 Stars = I've experienced better. At HOHT and Dakgogi. Tastier, cheaper, and more sauce varieties over there. That's where I usually get my KFC fix from."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the hype! I didn't have high hopes for it as fried chicken usually leaves me feeling gross after, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually really good!

Came with a group of friends and we ordered 3 large chickens:

Green onion fried chicken: Best out of the 3, perfectly crispy, not too greasy, and the green onions compliments the chicken very well. 

Crispy chicken: Also very good, loved the sweet and tangy sauce that was provided

Crispy chicken with soy garlic: This came last and by then it started to taste very similar to the first two, the flavour was good but was a little dry.

Spicy rice cakes: this dish was super spicy!! But loved the rice cakes !

Overall, very good place to hang out and have some awesome fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago, order the original half & half and dukbokki. Our server seemed like she hated her job and I felt like she catered to their Korean customers more, she gave side dishes to the table next to us when we arrived first and was still waiting. The food was good don't get me wrong but the service was meh. It wasn't until another server arrived for her shift and she was way better! Very friendly and always has a smile on her face!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3
Service-5
Food-4
Strikeouts-0/3

This place is a bit dark for my taste, but still good enough to take pictures. We ordered a whole array of chicken, and fries and before that arrived we had complimentary appetizers. This included this delicious buttered up corn on a platter. Since I didn't order, I don't know what most of the chicken was called, but none were that special. It tasted maybe a bit better than your traditional popeyes chicken or KFC chicken, but really stoodout and made me want to go back was the garlic fries. I've never tasted anything like it, and it was amazing. These garlic fries are must!! Another notable dish was the rice cakes with mussels, I know my girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed these little bites!!"}
{"text":"Went with with a group of friends Tuesday night and it was a good experience overall. Service was quick and our waitress was very sweet and helpful.

Extra Crispy Chicken - would recommend this!! It has extra batter which was light and crispy, and super juicy on the inside.

Half & half chicken - this includes their original and spicy chicken. It was nice to have a variety and definitely is big enough to share between 3-4 people. Their spicy sauce is like a tangy sweet and spicy. The original was good too, but I prefer the extra crispy one more.

Garlic butter fries - the fries itself is nice and crispy but we didn't like the garlic butter shake on. It was very sweet.

Fish cake soup - the broth was flavorful and was nice to have on a cold night. Some of the fish cake slices looked whiter or closer to being transparent and it made me wonder how long they've had it sitting around cooked, because it was pretty soggy. Fish balls were good, and I liked that there was udon in it. This has chili flakes in it so it was a little spicy.

Spicy rice cake & bbq chicken - rice cake had a nice chewy texture, but I think we didn't enjoy this dish as much because the sauce was on the sweeter side. It is spicy though. They were generous with the chicken, as they were large slices.

We'll definitely be coming back since it's local and has great fried chicken!!"}
{"text":"Came here for date night. The fried chicken was ok. A little on the dry side. Not much flavour. Maybe we should have ordered the spicy one, but we thought we had the spicy chicken with cheese so perhaps the offset would be nice. Bad idea. 
The spicy chicken with cheese tho.....oh my mouth just went to a lovely spicy place that made all that was good in the world, well we all know where I went .
The sweet potato fries were crispy and not oily. Soooooo good. 
The service was ok. There was only one waitress, so as the night went on things started to get a bit slow. 
I know this sounds odd to request hot water when everything is spicy but for someone who couldn't drink cold that day, they don't offer hot water. Not even warm. No hot drinks. Only cold water and cold beverages. 
Not a biggie, but seriously it's hot water. 
I'd come back for the spicy cheese chicken and maybe try some other items, but I'm not in a rush."}
{"text":"The Korean fried chicken was good, but by no means is it mind blowing. I know it's unfair to compare it to Popeyes, but it's not much better than it.

Got the ~$30 fried chicken combo for two. Which essentially comes with a soju or 4 beers. And some free sides.

Picked the grapefruit soju. It was very watered down. I would (if I could) ask for the bottle of soju on the side and mix it myself.

Not on my repeat list."}
{"text":"The chicken here is amazing. The food is never disappointing, the cheese with corn is my favourite of all! Could have easily received 5 stars except the service here is just alright because it is close to nearly impossible to communicate with some waitresses who do not understand English too well."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was really bad.  We went at 6pm on a Friday night.  At the time it wasn't too busy but we had to flag the waitress to get our orders in.  We ordered the boneless green onion chicken, bone-in crispy original and their butter garlic fries.  Or meal came with 4 sides (coleslaw, corn, pickled radish and some kind of salad)..nothing to write home about.  The corn was the worst out of the sides... The picked radish was the bees IMO.

The best was the boneless green onion chicken was the best since they gave you enough green onion and it was very tender.  The crispy chicken didn't have enough meat and wasn't as render as the boneless green onion chicken.  The fries was quite good too.

We had to flag the waitress for water... So service wasn't there.  When you pay with the machine, the lowest preset tip option was 15% was I thought was quite comical.

Honestly, Mymy Chicken across the street was much better food and service-wise.   I would choose to go there instead of the Fry."}
{"text":"We went to The Fry's new location on Bloor and Bathurst. Since we went for early dinner, the restaurant was not as full;  but by the time we left, the place was packed. 

This was our first time, so we went for the classic fried chicken. We ordered the half and half chicken to share and picked fried chicken in spicy sauce and fried chicken with sauce on the side. In addition to the chicken, the order came with complementary array of side dishes as such in a typical korean restaurant. However, this one puts a nice spin with an assortment of pickled radish cubes, leaf salad, and coleslaw on one plate and corn on another. Each one was delicious and perhaps the highlight of our meal.

When the chicken came, we were surprised by the portion size (it was quite generous). A note of caution is that specific pieces of the spicy chicken is quite hot. It has a nice sweet flavour, but because of the spicy nature it became hard to tolerate and we had to gulp down water for relief. The other fried chicken was nothing surprising, but was less greasy compared to western styles. The sauce that came with it was also sweet, but with less kick. I would have preferred more savoury seasoning to have a more diverse taste palatte, but whatever.

Overall, this would be a great place if you're looking for korean style fried chicken, but it is not out of this world. This would also be suitable over beer after a long work day."}
{"text":"Came here last week because it was one of the places open late with food we wanted to eat. Went with a group of people, it wasn't too busy on a weekday night. 

We ordered multiple flavors of fried chicken and the spicy chicken with rice cakes. The portions were good for sharing! They also give you corn and sides with the chicken! 

I know this is going to be a personal preference, but I really wanted some rice with my meal. If you're like me at all, order take out and make rice at home because they don't have any for you to order!"}
{"text":"Food is always good.. but service definitely needs work. They seem to always be understaffed, so the servers are always rushing, running around, and they tend to miss items."}
{"text":"Great place for a warm day. They open the front windows for a nice breeze. 
There was only one girl serving - so there was a bit of a wait for everything, and she wasn't good at english. Also, the parking lot is really small, and there is a popular restaurant in the same plaza as well. 

Like most Korean restaurants, they come with pre-meal little snackers, one which included cheese and corn on a hot plate! It was nice, but it was pretty much what you would expect it to taste like. 

The chicken was good - both boneless and bone-in. For the Original Chicken, it wasn't too dry or too moist, and it was really crispy. The price isn't bad for that amount of chicken we got either. 

However, for the Chicken with Spicy Sauce, be aware that the spicy sauce should come with a warning label - it's really a 5/5 on the hot scale. It was so spicy that we couldn't eat more than one each, and they weren't able to take it back to change for something else, or give us hot water to rinse off a bit of the sauce.

Anyways, I would go back, on a lazy day, for the chicken (with spicy sauce on the side, of course)."}
{"text":"The Fry was my go to for Korean Fried Chicken but have noticed the quality isn't as the same as before. I came here with my friend for dinner on a Thursday night and it was pretty busy so service was on the slower side. We were also seated at a smaller table and we did order a couple dishes: half and half chicken, fries, soju and we were given corn with butter and the coleslaw, onion, and salad trio. There were barely enough space on the table so it was a bit of an uncomfortable dining experience. 

The chicken was crispy on the outside and tasted so good but some of the pieces were so dry. The pieces that were juicy on the inside tasted like heaven though. The fries came out piping hot, straight from the fryer. 

I feel like the experience here can be a hit or miss, I don't know if I ever want to come back here, if I do, I'll go to a different location instead."}
{"text":"It's my favourite time of year again. It's sweater weather!! Sweater weather means I can eat an entire meal composed of fried chicken and no one will know except my own guilty conscience! But whatever, my future self will deal with that.

When they say fried chicken, they mean chop up that whole chicken and throw it in the deep fryer. Is that a chicken butt? Why not! We got regular crispy chicken, one with sauce, and one with spicy sauce. I'm not sure which one I was eating when I was trying the sauce and the spicy sauce, but it sure was tasty. The regular crispy chicken was good too but it needed something more...like sauce. 

The Fry is also home to the oddest tasting fries I've ever had, their garlic butter fries. It sounded normal enough on paper but when we tried it, it wasn't very garlicky and had a strange sweet and creamy taste that reminded me of milk-flavoured Pocky sticks. Oddly satisfying. 

Service...eh. Food was slow but people were friendly enough. There were a couple of things that were kinda irking though. 1) The table of people beside us that came in after us got their food first. 2) One waitress told us they were out of garlic butter fries. Then when we were served by someone else 5 minutes later and we mentioned the fries, they literally said \"what? no...we have it\". Well, ok then.

Other than slow service and waitress number 1 hiding fries from us (probably not actually), the Fry is a decent place to get some food of the fried variety. So throw on a sweater and ready your stomach. Baby, it's cold outside but the deep fryer is hot, hot, hot.

{"text":"I've had korean fried chicken once before, and it was amazing. This time, I decided to try The Fry due to the buzz. I found The Fry far from excellent but better than average. 

Their hot chicken is very spicy and tangy, making it hard to taste the chicken. The infamous fried chicken with green onion was overpowered by the five spice. However, The Fry has the best batter in terms of fried chicken of any culture. The garlic butter fries was very interesting; it tasted like sweet popcorn with french fry texture.

The vibe and music did not suit the restaurant. Heavy EDM and electronic music was playing loudly. Had to carry out a conversation with such demanding music.

Overall, pleasant experience and food enjoyment will vary by taste buds."}
{"text":"I come here... pretty often! The food is delicious, worth it's value, and I'm always coming back, which is what usually differentiates between a 4 and 5 star for me. The side dishes usually consists of pickled radish, some sort of pasta, and some cabbage with mayo - and they are pretty generous with the refills!

Usually, we get the half and half - soy/garlic & spicy, and it never fails to disappoint. The outside is damn crunchy and the inside is soft and tender with a kick of Asian spices. 

When it comes to Asian restaurants, I don't ever expect much from service, but I'd say that all of the servers are pretty attentive and they'll get you what you need! For $18.99 for half a rack may be a bit pricy, but the half and half deal is always worth :)"}
{"text":"The food is okay but there is really no service. I was sitting by the window freezing (2 person table) and all. I requested to sit somewhere else (4 person table)and they said no even though no one was sitting there. They only moved me after an hour when a 2 person table opened up. Turns out no one sat at the 4 person table after all. I might come back but most likely not."}
{"text":"We walked in here for a pre-movie dinner. Our order was taken pretty quickly and our drinks came within minutes. About 20/25 minutes after we had our order taken, the waitress came back to ask what we had ordered... By then, it was clear we'd never have a enough time to eat before our movie so I asked the waitress to cancel our order. I went back to the table and a second waitress came with fries but I told her our order had just been put in and cancelled right away so they couldn't be our fries. The first waitress came, we paid for our drinks and the second waitress came to ask he first waitress where the fries were supposed to go. Turns out that somehow, they were our fries... The first waitress came back right before we walked out and told us our food had actually been made and asked us if we'd like to take it to go. At that point, we expected them to comp everything and give us the food because they didn't want it to go to waste. The waitress came back with another bill and the machine, expecting us to pay for fried chicken and fries that would get soggy by the time we were able to eat them. That is VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE and that is why we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here on A wednesday night with my friend. Very easy to get a table for 2. This is a smaller restaurant than the one at Sheppard location .
We were served corn on the sizzling plate as a complimentary dish. It was really sweet and delicious. We were also given some salad/ radish side dish. 
We ordered Crispy wings and spicy sauce on the side. I was hoping the wings would be super crispy since it was not going to be drenched with sauce like the last time I ordered. 
I liked the fact that I got to dip the spicy sauce to keep the wings crispy. If we just order crispy wings on its own, it has no flavor. 

The spicy sauce was more sweet with a sudden burst of spice. It came with fries in the same basket. 

We also ordered a small plate of green onion with boneless chicken. It was a huge plate for 2 people! it was lacking on the sauce but I think the boneless chicken was fried really nicely. I like the sauce for this dish at Home of hot taste more because they had more sweet and onion flavor with their chicken. But The Fry does the chicken batter nicely and big pieces for this dish .

I would come again to order this boneless chicken dish... but my friend didn't feel well because it was much too greasy for her preference."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday evening with my girlfriends for a table of three. it was one of those cooler evenings (we were inbetween the transition of Winter to Spring). But this place was freezing. We were sitting in the middle of the restaurant but had to wear my jacket because the door kept opening and allowing a draft to come in. 
This restaurant is bigger in size compared to the other one location near Finch. 

Maybe it was the waitress that couldn't get our simple order down because other tables that came after us already got their dishes. We kept asking about our food after awhile of nothing to eat since we sat down. she probably didn't enter our order in the first place. 

We ordered Egg soup. it was ok, nothing special. But because it came at the very end, it was getting cold reallly fast since the restaurant or where we were sitting was super chilly. 

Ordered 2 plates of Fried chicken. Keep in mind that fried chicken means that there's other pieces of the whole chicken mixed in there. Some people were more dry than others. We ordered soy garlic (not much flavor and not as crispy as I was hoping) and spicy sauce (which had so much sauce that the chicken lost its crispiness, I assume). 

In comparison to Bon Chon chicken in the states, i would have expected \"korean friend chicken\" to taste like that. I'm quite disappointed and not happy with the service. 

Since it was my first time at the Fry, i didn't know what to expect --- we also didn't get that complimentary sweet corn dish =( true disappointment"}
{"text":"Almost missed it, a little door but a fair sized dining area....but probably fills up fast. I ordered out because I wanted to eat at home. 

Anyway I ordered extra crispy and the savoury spicy (dry and sauced) dish for $30. Came with a pop and a side of radish pickle (I'm in love with these). The take out box is unique and has a string to carry. Packed nice and secure.

Good portions, it was just two of us plus enough for leftovers. The meat is juicy and even though it took us 30m to drive home everything was hot as crispy still. The sauce was very flavourful but a bit sweeter than I expected. 

I do recommend this if your a fried chicken fan"}
{"text":"Love the crispy chicken and spicy chicken. Have ordered the sweet corn with cheese as well.  Dined in once but mostly purchased take out.  Consistent quality and efficient service.  Definitely recommended for fried chicken lovers.  Note that the spicy chicken is a spicy sweet but the heat lingers so you gotta love the heat otherwise it will be too much."}
{"text":"Came In around 10:30pm and waited at the entrance to be seated and the waitress barely acknowledged us and when she did, told us to wait which is fine but it took about 15-30 mins, keep in mind that there is no one else but the two of us waiting and there were four tables available before she assign us a seat. I don't understand why the owner or whoever in charge has just one girl working there to do cashier, taking orders and waiting tables all at the same time and while the place is busy. Can't really blame her but food came out slow and also tables were all dirty and didn't receive our sides such as the coleslaw and radish until we ask for it. The crispy chicken that we order which was the large size for $27-28 came out hot but too much bread battered and had no type of seasoning whatsoever, it tasted too bland. The fries were also lacking salt and they have something of flour coating on them which was bland to the T. We ate a few pieces and left about a bucket full of chicken combine. Wouldn't come back here again to waste money and time. The owner who is charging pricey $$$ for just chicken should have money to hire another waitress or waiter to help out with service. Don't even understand how yelpers can give good stars for food here that has no taste"}
{"text":"Never been to any of the other locations.  In fact we did not even know they had so many locations til we read the menu and it showed the other places.   The ambiance is good in a car like setting.  The background music was not blaring so we were able to hold conversations without screaming.  The appetizers (free refills) and butter corn (one time) was very good.  

We ordered their signature fried chicken with original and soy sauce.  It was very tasty and not dripping with grease and oil.   The portions were quite large so one order was enough for three of us.   It was probably because we could not handle too much fried stuff in one sitting.  Maybe we will try the noodles next time.  Very enjoyable experience and service was very good!   Should give it a go!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Wouldn't say that the food is bad, but I think you can get better chicken elsewhere. If you were to come here, they have four flavors for their chicken, all of which taste kind of similar in my opinion. Portions aren't bad for the price though. A lot of people recommend the garlic butter fries, but I didn't like it at all. It's great if you like sweets, but if you're looking for something savory, look elsewhere. This place does get crowded, so be sure to call in to see if you can reserve some spots.

Food (3/5):

Food was mediocre. I'm a simple person, and I really like chicken wings. If you're hoping that this will taste something like All Stars or Wild Wings, you're looking in the wrong place. They server Korean style chicken wings, which are a bit more saucy. The chicken is crispy, but it is not oily. If you really like Korean food, the sauces they use will be to your liking; else, I don't think you'll enjoy it that much either.

When I went, we also got the garlic butter fries. My expectation was something savory, but the actual fries were very sweet. They tasted like the sweet corn chips that you can get at Asian supermarkets. Definitely not something I was super excited about, but I can see why people like it if they are into something sweet that day.


Space / Location (3.5/5):

Their location is actually pretty good. They're in the same plaza as Nome, meaning that it is pretty close to the subway station. The actual restaurant is kinda small, and you will be expecting to wait if you go around the prime time. I highly recommend that you call in before coming here, just to make sure you won't be waiting like 45 minutes. If the wait is more than 30 minutes, I think you're able to find better food around. This place also gets really loud, so don't come here if you don't like that.

Overall (3/5)"}
{"text":"Had the Fry chicken in Ottawa a month  ago and been craving for more. So took the SO to the north York location and decided to take out.  Waited roughly 20-30 minutes for the order. 

We ordered the green onion chicken, spicy chicken, butter fries, corn and cheese and soya sauce chicken. You think we are feeding the military - just 4 people 

The spicy chicken is very spicy - if you want to clean out your colon, this is the one for you.  I had one piece and my mouth went numb.  

Love the original chicken with green onions. The soy sauce chicken is probably second best choice. 

The batter on the chicken is light and fluffy, unlike KFC or Popeyes. 

Butter fries has a slight sweet and garlicy-powdery consistency. This combo actually works. 

The corn and cheese - well as the name implies that's what you are getting.  It's ok,IMO."}
{"text":"The food here is very good.  I've had Korean fried chicken elsewhere (i.e. ajuker, not good at all) and this place is the best in town.  It was recommended and we went with a couple of friends and got two 1/2 and 1/2.  We tried the regular fried, sauced, soy and spicy.  It came with few appetizers including the pickled radishes and the buttered corn which were great to start with.   The chicken were very crispy and it was very close to how it tastes back in Korea.  I would definitely return here.

Food: 4/5, crispy chicken and well sauced.  The original fried chicken was our favourite.

Service: 3/5, typical service - nothing surprising but nice staff overall.

Ambience: 2/5, a little dark and not as nice but it's more a bar feel.  They could decorate the exterior a bit more so it's more welcoming.  It almost seems like it's closed.

Price: 3/5, not bad at all around $20 per person."}
{"text":"When I got into the restaurant it had that pub kinda feeling with the dimmed lights. We ordered different flavours of chicken: the soy garlic and the sweet, sour and spicy.

I quite enjoyed the soy garlic flavour. The sauce covered every piece of the chicken!

I wish they refilled the apps... the corn was a leaning on the harder side. 

Over all I would like to go back to try their wings. Hopefully next time they aren't sold out of it."}
{"text":"Love it!!! They have great appetizers and fried chicken. I ordered the fried chicken with green onion. The portions are huge! Three of us shared a large size and was super full.. The chicken meat tastes juicy and delicious. It's also a great place to hang out with friends :)."}
{"text":"Having tried the other 'the fry' on yonge and sheppard, I was expecting consistent food and taste. This restaurant offers free parking, which my credit card is definitely a fan of. The inside is dingy and cramped, just like the other one but they're about the same size. One thing I do like about this one is that they have dividers between tables.. although it takes up more room, it's nice not to be right next to somebody else and have to listen to their korean stories about shenanigans that has happened to them. 

Only one waitress on call but it seemed to be enough. She was sweet, spoke english perfectly and was efficient as ever. We got everything quite quickly and she was easy to flag down to get more stuff/take stuff away. I think she made up both the stars in this review.

We ordered the large fried chicken.. oh man.. we could've stuck with a small, there was SO much chicken ;-; I remember that I really enjoy the chicken from the other fry, but this one definitely tasted over-battered and some parts were also a bit dry..? It was good but it definitely felt like something was missing... The other thing we ordered were the butter garlic fries and to my surprise, they had sugar all over them?? It had a sweet taste for some reason and I even thought they mixed up salt and sugar. Turns out, that's the taste they're supposed to have. We weren't super big fans of the garlic salt, parm, salt AND sugar together, so we just left almost the entire thing uneaten. I don't think I'd recommend that dish, unlike you like sweet and salty in the most uncommon form.. then go ahead!

This definitely wasn't the worst place I can go to for korean fried chicken, but definitely not the best. I think I'll be sticking to the other location for now."}
{"text":"This chicken place is the shizzle. You want some fine Korean style chicken that you can't really get at wings places? You come here. 
Although I wouldn't say everything on the menu are gonna be perfect for everyone, if you find the right chicken, you will find yourself coming back for more.
Just remember that one large order is plenty for 2-3 people. 4 stars cause some in the menu ain't for me and I gotta be honest."}
{"text":"The fry has so much more to offer than what you'd think. It looks dingy from the outside and one of the photos on this yelp page said 'dark and uninviting'. I almost didn't want to go into it- however, I'm glad I did. 

I love korean bars and as soon as I saw the menu, I knew this would be no exception. Extensive menu of chicken, made in all different ways.. makes me hungry just writing about it now. The service was super quick and friendly. We ordered the best fried chicken I had ever tasted- step aside, dakgogi. There's a new chicken king in town. Breaded to perfection and seasoned to an even higher level of perfection. Damn! Also had the spicy rice cake with chicken and that was made incredibly because I died of happiness within one bite. Spicy and sweet level was JUST right and the chewiness of the rice cake... wow. The korean appies were yummy, loose corn is one of my favourite things and a whole plate of mayo loose corn... heart attack! (From happiness and yummyness) We also had the calamari, which was breaded perfectly and the squid rings had the perfect texture. Yum! 

Honestly, the venue was not even bad nor uninviting- it's dimly lit, just like any korean bar. I don't think anyone would enjoy a korean bar with bright fluorescent lights, right?

The Fry.. let me go exercise again and then I'll be back for you."}
{"text":"A good place to fulfill a fried chicken fix. I've only had Korean fried chicken a couple of times so I am in no way an expert, but I was happy with my order and how crispy the chicken was. I ordered the green onion chicken with hot sauce on the side. Their hot sauce is definitely hot with a sweet lilt to it. Goes really well with the chicken though. I liked the Korean side dishes things came with. Being Filipino, I kind of wished they had side orders of rice but they don't. Crispy french fries filled that void though. 

The restaurant itself appears a bit grungy though. Lighting is dark and it's hard to see through the front windows because the glass looks dirty. Loud music too so not a good place for intimacy but late night food, sure!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal at the Fry and I have been a frequent customer here coming on various occasions. I always ordered the Boneless Fried Chicken with Green Onion which is their signature dish here. It is always so delicious and awesome to try for anyone coming here for the first time. Also tried the corn dish and simply loved it. These are two dishes that I would recommend getting here. Service is quick and the staff are quite friendly. The place is quite small though and sometimes it can quite busy on the Friday evenings and weekends. Overall, I would highly recommend this. Can't wait to be back again!"}
{"text":"Great place to get your Korean Fried Chicken fix.  I've been to several of their locations in the GTA but this is my first time going to the one in the Annex. So I went for dinner on a Sunday with a group of friends. Restaurant wasn't busy so we go a table right away. The first impression that the Korean waitress gave wasn't really a good one. She started trying upsell us and trying to implement a minimum of $20 per person for dinner. A restaurant should not be allowed to do this at all. She also miscounted how much cutlery needed for the amount of people and nearly mistaken our order by assuming that we said 2 pitchers of beer instead of 2 pints. After that little hiccup, we finally settled down and ordered food. We ordered the Green Onion Chicken, Spicy Chicken with Cheese, the Rice Cake Rolls and Calamari. Fantastic dishes all around and you can never go wrong with their signature Green Onion Chicken dish. The Spicy Chicken with Cheese was alright with just the right amount of heat. You also get some side dishes such as sweet radishes, cut potatoes and lettuce with dressing. It was a great deal despite the customer service mishap. Overall, a great Korean restaurant to dine at and what a better way to have Korean Fried Chicken than with a cold one to go along with it."}
{"text":"Having never tried korean fried chicken, my friend and I were excited to come to the Fry and check it all out! Upon arriving on a Saturday night, we were immediately seated next to the door (which was a little chilly) but a good experience nonetheless. We opted for the garlic chicken and spicy tteokbokki, and received complementary sides like butter corn. Although the servers were busy, they were patient and helped explain the choices that were offered.

The food, however, was really nice! The spicy tteokbokki with cheese (added cost) was enjoyable but the KFC really made my night. The seasoning was perfectly done and the meat was nice and tender. I hope to come again soon!"}
{"text":"The chicken they have is pretty delicious as the regular fried chicken is deliciously crispy and the spicy chicken is also good but could be more spicy. Plus the service was very kind and to split with friends is pretty good. However, if you don't like greasiness do not get the corn with cheese as the plate is pretty much has a small puddle of oils and yet the chicken they fry isn't that greasy at all. Other than that, everything else was great.

The service is fairly slow as me and some friends asked for more water and the server completely forgot about it and prioritized cleaning the tables more. Another downside was that we also received our chicken and calamari pretty late, as we waited for it for over 45min.

Though I have only been there twice, the service should have been better to deserve better tip and not ask for it when me and my friends didn't get the service we needed."}
{"text":"OH BOY, this fried chicken is the BOMB. The batter is thick but so light and not-oily, the chicken is juicy and the sauces are so yummy. Four of us got 1/2 dry chicken and 1/2 saucy chicken and both of them were a huge hit and got devoured in 10 minutes. 

You get the entire chicken (none of that sketchy wingless chicken you see sometimes at other places) making it a blessing and a curse. We got so much meat but also a lot of bones which made it hard to eat. However, they do offer boneless which is something I would definitely want to try in the future.

Overall for $10 taxes and tips you can get yourself some yummy freshly fired chicken!"}
{"text":"The best part of this place is their big portions! 1 order can easily feed two people. The side dishes it comes with was pretty good including potato salad, pickled radishes and coleslaw and the best is the sizzling frozen corn on the skillet. 

The chicken itself was not bad, crispy topped with a sweet sauce and lots of green onions. The spicy flavor was also good not that spicy though. But both were moist and not dry. The only issue I have is that it wasn't really hot it came out on the lukewarm side. 

The restaurant itself was a bit on the cold side I was a bit chilly while sitting there even with the food. The staff was fine, everything wasn't memorable but fine."}
{"text":"We ordered Korean fried chicken and french fries on line.  It came with a can of Coke which we didn't order but there was no extra charge for that. ( Now I have some coke to make fried chicken from a recipe I found).  Included was some dipping sauce, thin slices of green onion which were tasty.  Also there was some squared white pieces in a liquid that smelled like carrots but they did not taste good.  The french fries were seasoned well, crunchy and and delicious.  The fried chicken was awesome, not at all that greasy but tender.  Will definitely order again and will try out the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious the only thing that irks me is the owner of the establishment has only one waitress who does the waiting tables, special requests, cleans tablets, get that table extra sides., billing, stupid questions from patrons like how many pieces of chicken comes in a dozen. I've came here about 20 times and every time that question is asked. Expect the service and wait time be slow don't blame the server it is not her fault she deserves the tips be sure to request for your sides or water as these can be missed. This place needs to hire 2-3 servers on fri,sat,sun and Wednesday special night. I enjoyed the soy garlic chicken wings great flavour and the sides of corn, pasta salad, turnips was delicious!!!! Again expect long wait times I don't get why people like to idle here eat and enjoy your food and get out for the next set of customers thank you"}
{"text":"Really good fried chicken, crispy outside juicy inside and not super greasy like traditional fried chicken. We ordered the regular whole fried chicken, Fried chicken in sauce. They have interesting sides that were ok.. But I'd mainly go back for the chicken"}
{"text":"If you want fried chicken in Mississauga this is new places where to come. Nice cool Decor inside. Admittedly I had to ask for a spoon as it's hard to eat the corn with chopsticks. 

Overall the side dishes where ho-hum but the fried chicken is amazing. Comes out steaming hot. Special kudos as I washrooms was so beautiful and clean."}
{"text":"Tried The Fry for the first time. I've heard a lot of great things about this place. Went around 9pm on a Wednesday so it wasn't too busy. Ordered the boneless chicken with special sauce, fried Calamari,  chador bacon fries and the cheese corn. Overall wait time wasn't bad 
Food was hot and fresh. The chicken and calamari was great. The corn wasn't bad but probably over prided at $9 and the fries were pretty boring."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening and was lucky to get a table before most of the after work crowd came. After 6pm it becomes a bit of a wait for a table, though they have a patio as well. The outside tbh looks a bit sketchy, like I was looking at the exterior wondering if this resto is even open cause they have reflective glass all over the front so you can't see inside. But don't let that stop you! Go in! 

My friend and I ordered small size of fried chicken in sauce, crispy chicken and corn in cheese. Both were nice, chicken in sauce was nicely seasoned but sweet. Crispy chicken was fried in a light batter that kinda reminded my friend of tempura? Portions were pretty decent and filling! They provide little side dishes of pasta, radish, and lettuce. 

Also, I loved the the corn with cheese dish! Yum yum! Didn't know what I was missing till now. Definitely recommend that dish! 

Drinks are reasonable too, I got a pint of Canadian for under $5 bucks. 

Overall, will come again. Good casual hangout spot for friends."}
{"text":"Chicken was flavorful
However, the portions mainly consisted of chicken thigh.
The chicken was not fresh as I did not feel good afterwards."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is very good. Other than that, everything was a bit pricey..... I'll go next time just for fried chicken."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. 

Came here on a weekend night and was promptly greeted at the door and seated. We ended up ordering the half and half chicken. It was half original chicken and half chicken with sauce ($29.99). 

Our half and half chicken came with 4 sides. The sides that we got were: 
- Pickled radish. I thought the radish wasn't crunchy and was pretty bland. 
- Corn. This came sizzling hot. This wasn't bad but I thought the corn texture was a bit waxy(?) for my liking
- Salad. This is just a shredded cabbage with dressing. Not much to say about that. 
- Coleslaw. It's coleslaw.

(I don't think the sides are refillable since the waitress just came and took our dishes away once they were emptied. They never asked if we wanted a refill or anything.)

Original chicken: My first impression of the original chicken was that it was greasier than I expected. Normally korean fried chicken isn't greasy but this was. It was quite disappointing. There also wasn't much flavor but luckily the chicken came with a side container of salt and a container of extra sauce. This helped save the chicken. 

Chicken with sauce: The sauce was sweet and slightly spicy. I actually didn't think the chicken with sauce tasted greasy. Maybe because the sauce covered up the grease taste? I preferred this one over the original chicken. 

Overall the service was good. The waitress come to check on us multiple times and the food didn't take too long to come out. 

The reason I'm only giving 2.5 stars is because I wouldn't come back here. The chicken isn't anything I would want to eat again."}
{"text":"Food was good, got the half and half (soy and sauce). I've had the boneless chicken before and I have to say I prefer the boneless chicken above anything else here. The servings are huge so definitely will have something to take home. The music is kpop, so if you don't mind listening to that. Tis a pretty good place"}
{"text":"First time going there last weekend and I am impressed with the level of spicy and sweet of their fried chicken! I love the vibe of the restaurant in general so I will be definitely be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant mainly because of the food so am giving this 4 stars. I love how we walk out of here completely full and there is always leftovers for us to take home.

We usually order the Special Half and Half fried chicken...one with just the regular sauce and the other half spicy. Along with it we also get their flavoured fries that I highly recommend. 

With any order, its always accompanied by a free corn appetizer and the usual Korean side dishes in a huge plate. Yum.

Overall I recommend coming here if your looking for a good fried korean chicken. They really know how to make it and in my opinion they are one of the best around toronto. Cant beat the flavour. 

But service wise, well they need to work on it. I would rate them like a 2 out of 5. There are days when they are attentive and there are days that you have to just get up and ask for the bill yourself. So its always 50/50. This is coming from someone whose been here a couple of times so I already know what to expect. 

Best time to come here is when they open at 5pm, its usually quiet when we go and we get what we want without any issues. At night time can be a little loud but it's expected since they serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Up on waiting for our table a few doors down, Jen and I decided to head to The Fry, a popular Korean Fried Chicken restaurant in North York.
it being located in a small parking lot, finding a spot during prime dinner hours can be tough.
Inside, The Fry is small with a handful of booths and tables. 
We ordered their Citron Soju for starters.

Our server provided a complimentary appetizer; melody of turnip and greens while waiting for the fried chicken.

Green onion Korean Fried Chicken served with shredded and season green onions on top.  Presentation was beautiful, perfect blend of spices and not overly breaded since they're fried.  The dish was served with corn.

Overall the experience was great! and I'd definitely be open to coming back here to try some Korean beer to compliment the chicken. :)"}
{"text":"3.8/5

You can't call yourself fried chicken enthusiast if you haven't tried korean fried chicken! 

Korean fried chicken is nothing like your typical sour &  sweet thick battered chicken wings. It's crunch, JUICY and tender. Can be VERY spicy so read the menu carefully. 

My go to is half crispy chicken (not the usual classic fried one) & half spicy fried chicken. It's the typical classic set to order in Korea, and this is the only way to make me and my sister happy lol. Their soy garlic is crispy garlicky yumminess as well. 

Now the service....  I will recommend you to forget about the service. These newbie(ish) servers don't really know what they are doing so their system is very disorganized and lack in staff doesn't help the situation as well. Just go for the food or do take out. When you order a set manu, usual there is a coupon on their special delivery box that allows you to get a free fried chicken when you collect certain amount of coupons.

This is the most authentic korean fried chicken I ever tried in Toronto. I'll love to give them 4 stars for the food but because of their lack in service and few other complains, I'll give them 3.8."}
{"text":"The chicken wings and fries are to die for at this place. Perfectly crispy, juicy, flakey, with just the right amount of salt. They also bring complimentary side dishes which I think is customary in these type of restaurants. I will come back here many times but perhaps try a different location as the service was a bit slow and we had to ask several times for basics like water, utensils, etc and for that reason alone I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"It was pretty good.  We ordered the special half and half and it was way to much chicken for 2 people.  Plus side we had dinner for the next night.  Sweet potato fries were yummy and all the sides were great!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, usually late at night. Always order the chicken, i dont think their fried chicken is that great but it comes in big portions so half a chicken can feed 2 people. 

Its also good the chicken all come with sides. Its a great sit down place for big groups, and the place is decently setup so seating is pretty good. It helps it usually doesnt get busy for me when i go which is usually 9pm."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place for fried chicken in Toronto. And this is coming from someone who loathes chicken. I never ever eat it. I actually choose the vegetarian entree at weddings rather than eat chicken. Yet the fried chicken at The Fry is so damn delicious that I will eat chicken here happily. Trust me you won't be disappointed. The service isn't that great (which is why it's not a 5 star review) but the chicken here is totally worth the subpar service and the sketchy front exterior."}
{"text":"I hate to leave bad reviews but this place has horrible service and the waiters are full of rude attitudes. When I went there at night it was quite busy, I ordered some takeout and while I was waiting for the food, I sat down at one of the tables. A waitress came and told me \"You cannot sit there.\" I said I was just waiting for my take out, she repeated, \"Yes, but you cannot sit here.\" Yes, this was what she said. I said okay and left the table, but there was nowhere else to sit, so I could only stand all the time. And for some reason people who came after me had their takeouts ready before me, I ended up waiting there for 40mins. 40 MINUTES! I will never come back"}
{"text":"Love the green onion chicken but their service can be better.

I ordered boneless green onion chicken, they gave me the regular green onion chicken that comes with bones. 

I also tried their house fries. Texture is like Harvey fries topped with seasoning. Meh.

I also tried the seafood rice cake dish + noodles + cheese. It's like seafood Alfredo with Rice cakes and udon. Not bad, but heavy."}
{"text":"Took my friends here for a little reunion since I haven't seen them in ages. There was around 9 of us, so you can imagine the space they have available for groups. The service was amazing and they are super friendly and explain everything to us. We tried the Green Onion Fried Chicken (which is a MUST try when you get there because what is the Fry without it?!) and then we tried the other half and half spicy chickens which was also delicious. I wish some of their chickens were boneless even though most of them are, but I'm that lazy one who just wants to eat the chicken without the bone. It gets kind of messy with the bone.

Nonetheless, it's a must try and don't be afraid to bring your friends."}
{"text":"Just had a great meal at The Frys for Korean fried chicken. Ordered the fried chicken with green onion and boneless fried chicken with spicy sauce. 

The meal comes with complementary 3 flavour vegetables, along with sizzling cream corn. 

The chicken came hot and quickly, service was great overall. If you're looking for some unhealthy fried chicken, this place comes recommended!

Things to improve: bathrooms can be cleaner"}
{"text":"This was my first introduction to Korean fried chicken. I'd say it's a great place to start with if you've never had it before - so different than Popeyes or KFC. I recommend the original chicken with green onion, and the spicy sauce one is also popular.

The Fry was super crowded when we went, so if you have a larger group definitely call to reserve. It's not a new restaurant so I'd say the lineup is the norm. 

Bringing a few people is great because then you can try out more flavours."}
{"text":"The Fry is one of my favourite spots in the city for fried chicken.

It's a Korean place, so as is tradition, they give you side dishes with your order, which can be replenished at your request. My favourite side dish has got to be the corn and butter in the aluminum serving tray.

As for the fried chicken, I always get the boneless chicken with green onions (a classic). The portions are HUGE. It's quite literally a mountain of fried chicken. Make sure you go with a group of friends. It's made to order, so it's always hot and fresh. This is a great food to eat with beer and Korean soju, while enjoying a great night with your friends.

The best part is that The Fry is open late, so it's perfect for those late night fried chicken cravings!"}
{"text":"The fry has always been my goto korean fried chicken place and have ordered chicken from them multiple times, however, my last order experience was horrible at this store location. I ordered half original and half spicy sauce as i looked over their menu, but i realized they gave me both covered in sauce. When i went back to ask them, they said I should have said original FRIED CHICKEN instead of original. Even though the menu right infront of me said original fried chicken, they said I wasn't specific. Please properly train your employees to learn the menu in english."}
{"text":"Terrible service, was seated and waited for my order for 30 mins. The servers did not bring my family and I water. The table was not cleaned properly. I'd suggest ordering uber from them because they lack such customer service. So disappointment"}
{"text":"Pretty good! :) Came here a few times for fried chicken & beer.
It comes with two side dishes - including butter corn on a hot plate too (Love this!).

Tried two flavours so far:

GREEN ONION FRIED CHICKEN 3.5/5
I liked this one! I'd rate this higher if they added more sauce. The overall flavour was delicious! It's just that we ordered way too much (got a large size for 2 people).. as always.. hahaha

SOY GARLIC FRIED CHICKEN 2.5/5
I had high hopes for this but there just wasn't enough sauce (even less than the fried chicken with green onions on top).. We had to ask the waitress for sauce on the side! It was a little dry overall."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving something savory, crispy and cheap. We decided to come by the Fry at 11:30PM to satisfy our craving. I don't have any regrets coming here, but I will let you know off the bat that this restaurant isn't very cheap. Two dishes came to a total of around $35 (including tax and tip)

We ordered the small green onion chicken and the garlic butter fries. This restaurant only had one waitress working at the time, so the service was a bit slower. But despite this, the waitress that served us did a great job! 

Side dishes came along with our meal - specifically daikon radish, salad and butter corn. The wait time to get our meal was a bit long, but these sides distracted us a little bit from the wait time. My friend and I had a mini competition of who can fit the most kernels on our chopsticks and ate it all one by one, which I'm not going to lie was /very/ entertaining despite my 22 years of age :P

The chicken portion was really big! A little /too/ big for the both of us. On top of this, the side of garlic butter fries made it impossible for us to eat it all in one sitting. I would say that both of these dishes were enough to feed three people - maybe four if everyone has a small appetite. 

The chicken was super crispy and not oily at all and the garlic butter fries were a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a salty flavor to them, but they were actually... kinda sweet! The more I ate them, the more I enjoyed the unique flavor of these fries.

This restaurant seems like the perfect place to go to if you want a very relaxed gathering with your friends in the late evening. Overall, I enjoyed my visit here and I'll be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Went in today and by a surprise, the food was perfect. I loved every bite of it. My boyfriend and i went to eat here since he wanted to take me to this place. He had heard of this place from his coworkers. We came during the opening of the restaurant, which was at 5pm. The service was really good. We've ordered the green onion, chicken and calamari and i have never seen any place that have their food that crispy. It was perfect. As a food lover and dating a chef that knows his food...this place just got some brownie points . We also ordered another dish, but the waitress was nice enough to tell us that the ingredients went bad, so they couldnt make it for us. Tipped her good for the service and she knew that it was my first time in their restaurant. I would definately recommend this to my friends.

Btw, their portions are huge, so if you guys plan on getting a large for 2 people, get a small instead and you'll thank me later....you're welcome"}
{"text":"We have tried to come a here at least three times before and this place is always packed. This time there was no wait so we decided to go in. This place is small with a seating capacity of around 30. Nothing much in terms of decor, and dim lights. We ordered the 2 half full chicken, with soy garlic sauce, and spicy soy sauce. It came with four sides: corn, macaroni salad, pickled radish, cabbage with mayo dressing. The sides were small but we got refills.

In terms of the fried chicken, I liked the soy spicy flavor better. It was more sweet than spicy and it had more sauce than the soy garlic chicken. The chicken itself - lots of bones in it. The service was attentive."}
{"text":"Went to the Fry a second time.. Had a way different experience this time. The food is great but the service is really hit and miss. Server forgot to bring the beer, forgot water, forgot to bring bill when asked, forgot to get my takeout box... Forgot everything.. Maybe the server was just having a bad day but it was bruutal service.

Anyway could be an anomaly but I would only go back for pickup and avoid dine-in"}
{"text":"I like the food, best korean fried chicken i have in town. But then the place is little bit small so you have to get there early to get seat. One more thing is the music is too loud,even it's a bar but most people go there just for food. Little pricy but it's still good."}
{"text":"Went for a late night snack with friends and had their green onion chicken and garlic butter fries, excellent decision! Their chicken is crispy and delicious and the fries were an excellent appetizer. They also give you starters like coleslaw and pickled radishes that are refillable. The waitress was very nice and quick. Definitely recommend going."}
{"text":"We came in on a friday night to try out their chicken since we were in the area. The food overal was good. The chicken itself was a little bit dry but the sauce was delicious. However, I only give them 1 star because we experienced very bad service. We had to walk all the way to the back of the restaurant and asked for everything that we needed, table, water, food.... our server wasnt friendly and got some attitudes. We wasnt happy so we decided to ask for the bill without finishing our food. I tipped 5%. She ran after me and asked for more tips. I could not believe it !!! You dont ask for more tips when you dont deserve it. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Come for the food. Ignore the bad service. 

The cheesy corn and garlic fires are super addictive and you just can't stop eating them. 

In terms of the Chicken I would recommend the Sweet and Spicy and the Soy Ginger. 

If you get the chicken without sauce it is a little dry but with sauce it is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great Korean fried chicken restaurant.

The original chicken is awesome. It comes with a sweet chili sauce. Ask for the spicy one if you like a little bit of spice.

The soy garlic chicken is amazing. Most Korean fried chicken places I've been to tend to pour the soy garlic sauce on top which makes the skin soggy. I suspect they spray sauce on the skin after or something, because you get the full punch of flavour without the sog.

Get the original fries. They're super crispy, kinda reminds me of the ones at the Costco fast food window.

The cheese rice cake is very good. Quite spicy though.

Food is great. I come from Vancouver, BC where there are tons of Korean fried chicken places. This one is better than some of the best ones!

Where they lose a star is their service. You have to ask for things a few times. Also I wish they didn't serve their sauces in those individual sauce containers though. Why not just use sauce plates or put bottles on the tables?!?!"}
{"text":"Solely based on experience as we didn't make it long enough in here to eat. 

We went in at dinner time, 7:30pm on a Sunday. We were seated quickly but when we tried to order, the waitress was extremely rude. 

Ordered seafood soup. Was told no, no seafood soup today.

Ordered cheese corn. Answer was just no. No. No? No. 

Ordered green onion chicken. She said, it will probably take 45+ minutes to make. 

LMAO. So what can I have? Nothing? We ended up just telling the waitress we will go somewhere else to eat and she just kinda rolled her eyes and left."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Fry. Whenever I tried going to the downtown/North York locations, they would say it's a 30+ minute wait, so I was quite pleased that I didn't have to wait (practically empty, 2-3 other groups). This new location is nicely renovated, a mixture of black and wood themed booths with a central bar table. 

Onto the food, I ordered the boneless chicken in spicy sauce (~$18+tax/tip). It came with a small portion of side dishes, including a sizzling plate of corn. The corn was so hot that there was a burnt section on the foil. It was splattering dangerously, to the point where some of my corn exploded onto the floor and I flinched when the hot oil hit my face. The chicken arrived sometime later, with about 20 pieces liberally coated in sauce. The sauce was tangy, sweet, and a little spicy. The closest thing I can compare it to is sweet and sour chicken and with a hint of gochujang. I wish my chicken was a little hotter though... For freshly fried chicken, I was expecting it to be juicy and steaming when I bit into it. Instead, I was left wondering how long my chicken was sitting to cool before it reached me. I also got sick of the same taste after the first couple pieces and ended up taking the rest home. 

Overall it's a decent place to go if you're in a small group and willing to share multiple dishes. I wouldn't recommend it if you're dining alone though because you really can't get more than 1 item and there aren't bento options."}
{"text":"Been to the other ones at the North York location and I am so happy they opened up one here in Richmond Hill. You can never go wrong with KFC. Location is at a predominantly Chinese plaza just at the corner. My party of 4 arrived on a Saturday evening around 6 and there was space for us to sit down right away. Be warn if you choose to go later, I say 7 on a weekend evening be prepared to wait. They were kind enough to refill our sides. My favourite being the creamy corn. For 4 ppl, we ordered 2 half chickens and my absolute favourite fries: butter garlic fries! I was totally satisfied, just saying."}
{"text":"Best garlic butter fries ever!! Then again, I'm not sure of another place that has garlic butter fries but their regular fries are just as good too. Nice and crispy. 

Although I'm not a fan of fried chicken, but the fried chicken here is really not that bad. I just can't have a lot of it. However, the boneless bbq chicken is decent and they have plenty of appetizers at the beginning to keep you eating while you wait for your food. 

This place does not take reservations, so if you have a big group (ie. 6 or more), expect to wait a while. It's a really small restaurant and I must say I was not pleased with the wait at all but we only waited because of the garlic butter fries. One of my friends arrived first and was just waiting at the back, and then I saw another group of 6 (whom I thought came after us) and they sat down before us because they walked to the front. Had to be a bit aggressive because as soon as I noticed people after us sit down before us I gave the wait staff a hard time. After a while, they said those people came \"before\" us (which I was a bit skeptical of) and eventually I just let it slide. We had a table 10 minutes later still. The size and the wait would probably be the only reason why it's a 3 star and the over use of green onions on the green onion chicken. There's just too much of it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night with my girlfriend, place was rather empty when we came in at 5:00 but got a bit crowded as it got closer to 6:00. There was one waitress working at the time, we got the bigger corn cheese (there's a complimentary version but I knew it wasn't enough for the both of us) and the special half and half fried chicken, we chose the soy garlic and the fried chicken in sauce. The plate of corn cheese came out about 10 minutes after we placed our order, the chicken obviously took a bit longer since it's made to order. The wait was quite long as the place did begin to fill up. I felt really sorry for the waitress as she suddenly got swamped with orders. Poor thing ran around to all the tables and when our chicken came out, she realized she had forgotten our water so she quickly went back to the kitchen to get it.

Taste scale time~
Corn cheese: 5/5
OMGSH this is an awesome app. Corn cooked on a skillet plate deliciously coated with some garlic butter then layered with a thick gooey mozzarella cheese and some kinda herb seasoning. It is bomb. Luckily, it's a complimentary app.

Fried chicken in sauce: 5/5
Light and crispy, good crunch and beautifully seasoned plus they were nicely tossed in the sauce so the sauce wasn't making the crunchy batter soggy (ain't nobody want soggy batter chicken). The batter that used wasn't thick and was light and that's what I appreciate about KFC. You got a lot of random pieces of chicken, honestly I couldn't where on the chicken some of the pieces came from but hey, we Asian, we eat the whole thing. Even though I asked if the sauce was spicy, the waitress reassure me it was mild with a slight kick and that's exactly what I got. Excellent job.

Soy garlic chicken: 4/5
Sadly the soy garlic chicken was underwhelming for me. Like the soy garlic flavour wasn't really there, my girlfriend even thought I had ordered the regular fried and I told her that I ordered soy garlic, the flavour eventually did come out after nearly finishing the basket. I guess they tone down the hit so foreigners aren't in shock but I don't know.

By now, the place was packed to full capacity. There are 2 waitresses running around, yet still rather difficult to flag them down for our bill. Once flagged, it was at another 15 minutes before the waitress brought the receipt over for me to pay. Overall experience here was okay maybe if I went on another day, the service might be better?"}
{"text":"Overall, the food is pretty good. I would even say the best Korean fried chicken you can find in downtown Toronto. I've tried spicy chicken, crispy chicken, and original chicken and they were all good. 

However, as many others mentioned, service here is completely garbage. They didn't even give us water today... If you are too drunk to notice their crappy service, this is one of the best place to go at night in Bathurst and Bloor area."}
{"text":"Just Eat is a terrible delivery service, was desperate for Korean Fried Chicken that's why ordered through them.. as usual took almost 2hrs to get my food .. 

The Fry has amazing chicken!!! It was worth the wait... i ordered the half original and half spicy... absolutely delicious!!!!! Portions are amazing... the chicken tasted great the next day as well and did not have a weird after taste..so you know you're not wasting food! I highly recommend this place to hit the spot with your cravings!"}
{"text":"This place is better than the ones from Korea. I have came to this restaurant many times. I am glad that they opened at Yonge location.  They have a nice patio at the back of the restaurant. I wish I knew this sooner. If you decide to eat in the patio, they have warm blankets. When you order any chicken, you will get salads, relish as appetizers (this is unlimited) and also get some butter cheese corns(just one). I have tried every single chickens in the store but I like the green onion fried chicken boneless the best. I find spicy sauce chickens are too spicy. If you want an authentic korean style chicken, I recommend green onion chicken w beer. Small size is good for 2 to 3 ppl ($18.99). Great fast service and great food. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place. I tend to have the 'fry' cravings when i want to eat deep fried and delicious chicken. Always order the special half and half which comes with a good quantity with the garlic fries. Costco fries probably but who cares.. they're the best fries when crispy and seasoned! Service is fine but sometimes short staffed I guess when it's only 1 server during rush hour. Maybe a dash more salt could be added to the crispy chicken but always will be my go-to spot."}
{"text":"Awesome fried chicken and side dishes. The corn cane sizzling on a hot platter and other side dishes came in organized plate. The chicken was light and crispy with overload of the sticky delicious sauce! It's light and airy not dense like Popeyes but still has great crunch!"}
{"text":"been to this place a number of time, but it has been very disappointing. I mean, the chicken tastes fine, but it has huge up and down, sometimes the sauce tastes too sweet, sometimes tastes good. and also the side dishes, you should know the importance of pickled radish when it comes to Korean fried chicken. most of times, it wasn't done properly meaning the radish needs to be picked longer before serving it.

anyways, to the main point why I'm writing this as chicken lover( I want this restaurant to be improved for the better service)

1. The Horrible inventory management
last couple times I went there. they ran out of draft beers. and it was around 6pm on friday(supposedly the busiest day of a week)  they must have a terrible manager who keeps on stocks. Never been to any restaurant that ran out of something before the weekend starts. and last time I tried to go again(I live in the annex) it was Saturday night, they ran out of sauce!! How can a korean chicken restaurant ran out of sauce?? that's by far the worst inventory management that i have experienced. I worked at various restaurants as kitchen manager, and I managed inventories. it's a major problem, that could badly damage the revenue of the restaurant. It has happened several times. I don't understand their management. whoever in charge of inventory need to be let go in order to serve better.

2. Consistency
As I mentioned earlier, this restaurant's consistency is really bad. Sometimes I feel like eating totally different food from different restaurant. Not only their inventory management sucks, but also their cooks don't know how to follow recipe, which is a simple task.

The fry became the main brand of Korean chicken in Toronto, and they have to have certain management skills to continuously growing or serving proper service to costumers.

I really hope the owner to see this review and consider changing their management for better service.

I will give it a try one more time there, if they don't have draft beers or sauce. I will directly call the management team to complain."}
{"text":"Got a chance to try the half and half chicken deal and enjoyed the batch that was drizzled in the \"special sauce\" a lot more than the soy garlic one. I didn't find the chicken to be as crispy for Korean fried chicken. Wasn't a huge fan of their honey fries, they are good but for the amount they provide, it was too much. Five friends including myself devoured the chicken and fries, so definitely bring a group with you if you want to order that much. 

Def a nice sit down place though as they serve lemon-flavoured soju. I wouldn't return again as I wasn't too impressed but I'm happy that I tried it. I will continue my search for the best Korean fried chicken in the GTA."}
{"text":"The fried chicken here tastes great but a bit on the pricy side. I tried the soy garlic and original fried chicken in the half and half combo.. not sure why soy garlic costs an additional $1 over sweet and sour but it tastes good so I'll give it a pass. The soy garlic tastes more like soy sauce with very light garlic flavoring. They also gave free appetizers - salad and corn in oil (was good but extremely oily)... Great place to eat with friends but it was a bit filling for just two ppl!"}
{"text":"Ordered C8 ($29.99) which was Half & Half chicken. Half was original chicken (basically normal deep fried chicken) and the other half was chicken was sauce. The price may seem a bit daunting at first but it's for an entire chicken and it's enough to feed 3 people. 

The food itself was pretty average, nothing special about it. The chicken with sauce was definitely tastier than the original chicken so if you can only get half a chicken, get it with sauce! The sauce was sweet with a slight spicy-ness to it. The flavours worked well together. The original chicken was also a bit greasy compared to other korean fried chicken places. 

The service was good although I felt they were a bit understaffed as there was only one girl waiting tables. She kept coming around to ask if everything was good, it was easy to flag her down when we needed to and food didn't take long to come."}
{"text":"Those crispy chicken is to die for. I love the sauces too. Yeah it's expensive but it's so good. Every dish I ordered was delicious. If you want to try a few different flavours, get the half and half. What would be awesome would be them providing some plastic gloves so we can eat with our hands without getting messy. Other than that, I love this place. It's the bomb!"}
{"text":"The fry is a good spot for Korean fried chicken. It's nothing over the top but always gets the job done. I go here pretty regularly and I've never had a really bad experience here. Chicken isn't the most moist and I would definitely recommend the sauced chicken. If you come here they'll always give you complimentary corn with butter."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is pretty damn good. Not much in the way of vegetables or starches as accompaniment though. One \"half and half\" order of fried chicken (i.e. Two flavours) is more than enough for two people.

If you get take out you get a neat takeout box and 1 canned soft drink. Take out is the way to go really if you want anything resembling a complete meal (i.e. With most food groups) ... you can go across the street to M2M and get some Korean side dishes and maybe some type of bun or roll to get with the chicken."}
{"text":"The fry is a long established chain of Korean fried chicken restaurants, but the first one that I can recall that has opened in Richmond Hill.

I have been here twice already, once for dinner on a weeknight and another time for lunch on a weekday. Both times, they were pretty steady with the amount of people inside, as well as the number of take out orders.

In both my trips so far, I have tried the green onion (large), honey garlic and spicy chicken platters. Both meals we were served 3 to 4 sides. The main sides are pickled radish, some shredded lettuce and a coleslaw. If you come here for dinner you also get a side sizzling platter of corn. This is only for dinner. 

These sides were very complimentary and they seem to give a nice cooling sensation if you decide to go for the spicy chicken. 

Also, the large fried chicken can easily feed two people. And given its price point ($30~) I would expect nothing less.

Koreans seem to have a real love affair with fried chicken, given the number of fried chicken restaurants I see both in Toronto, and when I lived in Seoul for a short time. And they honestly probably make some of the best fried chicken I can think of and the Fry is no different. The fried chicken comes out lightly battered with a nice crunch, while having a nice chunk of steaming chicken inside. I would say the chicken to batter ratio is some where along the lines of 80% chicken and 20% batter - which is a very good bite of chicken. 

I dont think I need to say I will be back again, as I already mentioned I have been here twice already. So I wouldnt hesitate to recommend stopping by here if your in the area and have a hankering for good fried chicken."}
{"text":"Close till 2:00 p.m. even weather is bad, everything is fresh, not pricy, great service."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Pub setting. Korean fried chicken and beer. Food wise, you can't really go wrong. Service was so-so. If you want to order take out from home, you have to physically go into the restaurant to order since they don't take orders over the phone. Which sucks since it takes them 20mins to make each order. But anyway, I really like their green onion chicken and most of the other sauces go well with the chicken too!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here looking to satisfy our korean fried chicken craving. We ordered special half & half chicken - we chose soy garlic and spicy as our two flavours. We also ordered a side of garlic butter fries. 

Every meal comes with banchan or small side dishes which consisted of coleslaw, macaroni salad, pickled radish and our favorite which is sizzling corn with butter. Would have ordered more corn but we had to save more room for the chicken. 

The chicken came out fresh and hot, the portions were generous and had a nice crunch to every bite. Both flavours were good and contrasted each other well. The spicy sauce had a nice kick to it and is addictive. The soy garlic sauce was good as well and not too sweet. The garlic butter fries were a great side to order but quite filling when having alongside the banchan and the entrees. Overall, their KFC satisfied our craving but still does not compare to other places abroad."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out but unfortunately did not get any sides that people seem to be raving about. Maybe next time will try dining in. Fried chicken with sauce and their sweet potato fries were great! Just the fried chicken alone was ok. A little bit pricey but decent!"}
{"text":"Huge, huge disappointment. I love fried chicken but this was mediocre and minimal. Onion ring orders had 3 onion rings. Literally - $6 for 3 slices of battered onions. Cost over $100 to get three small portions of chicken - and they included inedible chicken backs. Not the oysters - the spine, battered and fried. Butchery was terrible. Quantity terrible on everything, quality pretty bad too. The rice cakes were good, but the rest was a"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Korean fried chicken to see what the hype was about and I heard The Fry was the place to go. Luckily I was running an errand near! I ordered one small fried chicken with the spicy sauce and sweet potato fries. The chicken wasn't as tasty as I thought they would be. The sauce sweetness was a bit much but the sweet potato fries balanced it out. And holy moly. The sweet potato fries taste amazing. Anyone coming here should definitely try them. 
Also, the meal did come with some complimentary sides. The washroom was clean, the staff did their job and the atmosphere of the restaurant was quite nice! Overall, decent experience."}
{"text":"New place grand opening. It was pretty quiet during lunch hour. The service was excellent, very patient with us on ordering... we took a bit of time on thinking what to order. The chicken taste not too oily, I personally like green onion fried chicken better, the skin is so crispy"}
{"text":"Can you say deelishus?

The resto is really small and right across the LCBO near Finch Station.  We got the half half chicken with two baskets, one with fried chicken + sauce & extra salt/pepper, and one spicy friend chicken.  I thought the plain fried chicken was good with the sauce, too salty with the extra salt/pepper - but a bit on the dry side.  The spicy chicken though.. mhmmmmmmmmm!  Tender and flavoured en pointe.  The apps for this resto was also unique, we got buttered corn on a sizzling plate in addition to the standard salad and Korean side dishes.  

Overall, definitely recommended for a casual dinner with yummy fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Our meals came with appetizers (salad, coleslaw, pickled radish) and a small plate of corn and cheese. The appetizers tasted ok. 

For the mains, we ordered: 
Soy Garlic Chicken (small) - We didn't even get this in the first place. The waitress got the order wrong and gave us fried chicken in sauce instead. The taste of the fried chicken in sauce was alright. I had an issue with the texture of the chicken. Both the dark and white meat was REALLY dry.  

Green Onion Chicken (small) - When the waitress notified us that she got our order wrong, it seems like they added a bigger portion to our green onion chicken. The chicken tasted pretty much like batter and really dry. The white meat was also really tough to eat on. 

Cheese Fries - The fries were really salty but the portion was reasonable. It came with nacho cheese, bacon and ketchup. 

Corn with Cheese - We ordered this without knowing there was complimentary corn with cheese. The corn was mostly burnt but the taste wasn't bad. 

Since we came on a weekday, there were not many people in the restaurant and there was only one server. For one server, the service was ok. Also, since the food was really average, I don't think I would come here again."}
{"text":"'Round these parts of North York, KFC isn't about an old white guy sporting a string bow tie... 
Been a couple times already, and you're here to order all things fried. From what I'm told, it's about the double frying technique, and they do it well here. K-Towners know what's up with fried chicken and the fixin's accompanying em. 
**for the non-chopstick experts, ask for a fork/spoon when you order. you'll understand why when the sizzling creamy/cheesy corn comes around.

All things fried - YESSS... with Beer.. double YESSSS!! 
This place only gets 4 stars only cause of the health factor. 
Less one star cause this place added another inch to the spare tire I seem to be carrying around."}
{"text":"This places reminds me of my basement, old, wooden and smelly....well actually my basement isn't smelly but this place sucks
We waited like 20mins for someone to serve us and it looked like they didn't give shiitt

Ordered those beer towers and our canadian tasted kind of funky 

Will not come back ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"No complaints about the fried chicken itself. Ordered the half & half chicken. Nice and crispy. I wouldn't bother ordering it again, but others seem to like it. 

Place was way too dark and too loud on music. Service incredibly slow on a Sunday night with just one server struggling to clean, serve, and take orders. Waited a long time by our table just to get it cleared so we could be seated. Also forgot our drinks. 

Fries taste like Costco fries."}
{"text":"Light, tasty and not greasy at all. Perfect Korean fried chicken, especially when boneless! Big servings too, that's a small in the picture. For $19 it's a great value. 

The side dishes are not so great, but the corn is very good. 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow but the chicken was delicious. We got the spicy sauce and soy garlic"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night with a friend and it was packed - only one table that was open. If we came any earlier than 9pm, I'm sure there would have been a wait. I would recommend ordering two types of boneless chicken (one with a heavy sauce and one without). Every bite of my chicken (with bones) was amazing, save for the fact that I had to keep picking away at the bones.

We got the Half and Half Chicken ($27.99) with the Soy Sauce Garlic Chicken and the Fried Chicken in Sauce. The basket was enough to feed the two of us - especially since they gave us free corn kernels on a skillet and the typical Korean starters. Both were tender and tasty, whenever you didn't have 80% bone and 20% chicken (some pieces were 100% bone and 0% chicken...) 

I would say the Fried Chicken in Sauce was a bit too saucy and the Soy Sauce Garlic chicken was exactly what it was supposed to be. I liked having the two and eating them interchangeably (I can't stand food that has too much sauce).

At the end, my friend and I could not finish the food. We gave up 90% of the way there. I would have pushed on but I had too much of a stomach ache from all the coffee I had earlier that day."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Too much food for me hahaha the service is good. Ordered Chrispy chicken."}
{"text":"A bit on the expensive side. We had the green onion fried chicken and soy garlic chick, ddukkbogi, and garlic butter fries. The garlic butter fries were good, a very interesting taste, slightly powdery. the Ddukkbogi is just next level spicy. I honestly ate 1 piece and paid $14. The chicken tasted comparable to \"home of hot taste\"."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Korean fried chicken and this place doesn't disappoint. 

Just like at any other Korean fried chicken place, I stay away from the spicy sauced chicken. I just don't like it. 

So go with the regular fried chicken or the green onion fried chicken and you'll be soooooo happy. 

I'm not usually a proponent of boneless fried chicken because it's usually dry white meat, but at The Fry, they use the dark meat and it's sooooo good. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Quick service, nothing special about the food. 

Ordered the egg soup, butter garlic fries and spicy chicken with cheese. 

Egg soup: pretty good, the egg was fluffy and soup wasn't too salty. 3/5

Garlic butter fries: as described on the menu the garlic was powder form, the fries were sweet which is not what we were expecting. However they were fried quite well. 3.5/5 

Spicy chicken with cheese: came out on a hot plate, it tasted good, but nothing too special about the flavours. 

Overall this place is average, not impressed on this first visit. Unfortunately we thought the spicy chicken would be deep fried. Will come again just to try the fried chicken."}
{"text":"First time eating at The Fry and would definitely go again to try their other chicken dishes. I ordered the spicy chicken with cheese, spicy rice cake, and sweet potato fries as a side.

The chicken and rice cakes were served hot and in a timely manner. Both were delicious and cooked well. Both dishes were portioned well for two people at most, and were cut into pieces small enough for one bite. I would suggest adding 2 pepper signs on the menu for the spicy rice cake as it was considerably more spicy than the spicy chicken.

As for the sweet potato fries, I never got to try it. They got our order wrong and gave us the cheese fries instead. However, I would definitely recommend the cheese fries as it is something I would order next visit. The fries were reminiscent of Costco fries and covered with dry cheese bits all over like it was breaded chicken. It was delicious.

Overall, the food was great and the service was satisfactory. My only gripe would be getting my order wrong, which still turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I would suggest having the waitresses/waiters write the order down on paper instead of memorizing."}
{"text":"Glad to have a closer branch. We came on a Wednesday dinner around 6pm and there were only a few people but after sometime, the place is filled but no wait line. This is a much bigger place and a nicer atmosphere. Notice that it only has one server so service is really slow. We have to call her attention several times and follow up on an appetizer that never came. 

They serve free appetizers like corn with cheese, pickled raddish, coleslaw(yum) and cabbage with dressing.  We ordered spicy chicken with cheese. Oh my this dish is really spicy hot even with cheese. Not for people like me who can't handle spicy food. We also had stir fry chicken bbq noodle. It is chicken bbq with udon noodle mix with rice cake and vegetables in sweet sauce. I love the taste and the chewiness of the rice cake. Then we had 3 different flavors of fried chicken, half and half, we chose soy garlic chicken and fried chicken in sauce(sweet, spicy) and green onion chicken. All of the chicken were fried very crispy even after coated with sauce.

Food is really good, it's the service that needs improvement. For a group of 8 people, mostly teenage boys, we just had enough food. A little bit pricey but overall its ok."}
{"text":"The service was slow and not attentive. The waitresses didn't offer to bring water or checked on our table during our meal. Food is over priced for what you get. We had a regular fried chicken and green onion chicken. They werent juicy or crispy. Not a memorable meal."}
{"text":"Parking: Free - small lot

Washrooms: OK

Experience/Venue: Small venue.

Food: As someone who does not eat any meat my options were severely limited to french fries. I was here mostly to hang out with friends. So the 2-star rating says \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" It fits my experience perfectly because I've probably have experienced better, nothing against the actual food and staff personally. I also need to start throwing around 2-stars to balance out my reviews and this is my first 2-star rating."}
{"text":"My favorite here is their Green Onion Chicken and Garlic Butter Fries. Whenever I come here with my friends I always order these two plus whatever additional items they want to try. It can get pretty loud in there so usually I choose to bring larger groups of friends there (as opposed to just 2-3 for catching up etc.). So far I've brought a few groups of my friends over, and they all loved the place (Sheppard&Yonge).

One of the other things I like about this place is their corn side dish that comes before your meal, I eat corn although I'm not a big fan, but I really like how it's done here.

I've only ordered their chicken for take out once (Green Onion Chicken), but it was also really good! The take out box was neatly designed, sauce was packed at the side, so when I got home the chicken was still very crispy.

It does get busy over here, so I usually go around 5-6pm to avoid lineups if I know I need a bigger table, since they usually open around 5pm."}
{"text":"I've been to the fry many times including this exact location. Last month I went to the one in north York. Was hesitant to get the spicy rice cakes again here because it was not that great in north York. However, the menu is limited so there wasn't much else to choose from except fries. The rice cakes this time were okay. Not very spicy but spicier than the spicy fried chicken we got. The spicy chicken was a huge disappointment. 2 people usually finish the small basket, but we could not finish this simply because we didn't want to. I remember the chicken being crispy/crunchy and then smothered in sauce. This time it was just a huge soggy bowl. The sauce was also very acidic with a strong vinegar taste. It lacked gochujang flavour!!! I ended up dipping the chicken in the rice cake sauce so it would be spicy. The first piece of chicken my friend got was also cold and had a bone. He thinks maybe they took someone else's leftovers and topped it up. We had asked for boneless chicken. 
We also got the appetizers last. We thought maybe they forgot... The salad and coleslaw were good. 

Overall, would not come to this location again.
 
- rice cakes got replaced to a thinner and smaller cake
- Prices went up from last time (~$2)
- newly renovated
- newly designed menu to include more pictures"}
{"text":"Came here once and honestly the chicken was amazing!
However, as some people have said, the service is not the best and the decor looks pretty ghetto with extremely poor lighting. 
This is definitely not a sit-down restaurant imo. But since it is open so late, its definitely a great delivery option for those late night cravings and study breaks"}
{"text":"The Fry was my first experience with Korean Fried Chicken and I fell in love with it. It gave me the confidence to try Korean Fried chicken at other restaurants and it does not compare with the Fry. They have a great combo with a few bottles of beer and a large portion of fried chicken. I recommend the green onion boneless chicken for the best experience. 

If you're daring and can handle your spice, go for the spicy chicken but be warned. It is HOT, this is coming from someone who eats spicy on the regular and orders SPICY for pad thais at Thai Express (if that gives you perspective?). 

I also highly recommend the spicy rice cake. It is delicious and the right amount of spicy. All in all I highly recommend this restaurant. Expect about $15-20 per person for dinner."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy fried chicken at a very reasonable cost! Not at all greasy, and very well made. My friends and I shared a large crispy fried chicken ($33)  between the three of us, and honestly, it was so much food. We probably would have been fine ordering a small ($19), as we had about half left after we were done. Each order comes with 4 sides: pickled radish, shredded cabbage, coleslaw, and sweet corn. The sides are also very tasty, and they help cut through the fat of the fried chicken.

The only downside is that the service is very slow, as there is only one server for some reason. They won't come to check up on you, so if you need anything you'll have to try really hard to get their attention. The space is also quite small, so if you don't come right when they open (at 5pm), you'll most definitely need to wait for a seat."}
{"text":"- Nice little casual hang out spot. Free parking available.
- Green onion Fried chicken all the way here. The half and half is a great deal.
- Korean side dishes are awesome, Much needed with the greasy chicken. I keep asking for more.
- Service is usually speedy, however its a bit on the slower side during weekends.
- Tip : Have a few pitchers, take your time"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it was but I've had a HUGE craving for Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) for about a month, even though I've never had it. Was finally able to get my hands, mouth, and belly into some KFC and the Fry did NOT disappoint! 

Went with 2 other friends for a late late dinner (10:30pm) on a friday night, and I guess I'll start with the negative, which was the wait for a table. I mean we all should've known that K-town on a friday night - that late, at a place that serves alcohol - would probably have a long wait, but lesson learned. We waited about 50minutes for our seat, but i think it would've been a bit less had the servers cleaned up a few of the tables which cleared up earlier. It did seem like they were understaffed that night.

We ordered the Green Onion chicken and the Boneless Chicken in Sauce, along with an order of Garlic Butter fries and a bottle of grapefruit soju. The soju was made in house, which was cool, but it wasn't the same as the ones we're used to getting at other joints that come in a packaged bottle. Both chicken items were amazing - we were a bit skeptical with the boneless chicken as we weren't sure what the sauce was, but I personally enjoyed it over the Green Onion. It's almost like a sweet and sour sauce, which was excellent! The Garlic Butter fries are exactly just that - imagine garlic bread, with a bit more butter on it, in fry form. It was definitely good for the first 10-15 pieces or so but after a while it does get a bit heavy. We also got both chicken items in the smaller size, and it was perfect for sharing between 3 people - even had some leftover!

Overall I'd come back, but make sure to come prepared to wait. Maybe I'll even try takeout?"}
{"text":"Always find myself back at the Fry when I'm craving KFC! That day i went we ordered boneless chicken with green onion and fried chicken in sauce. I always get the chicken with green onion and it never disappoints. The chicken is moist and has a nice crunch to it. Also another one of my favourites here is the corn cheese! I've learned that ordering the chicken in spicy sauce is too spicy for my liking so I just switched to just the sauce (still tastes very good)"}
{"text":"So happy I finally got to try The Fry! They've actually expanded to multiple locations since I first heard of them, and this one's conveniently right by Bathurst Station and the new Hot Docs Cinema. Upon walking in, the decor looked like it was under construction. One side has cool wallpaper with Korean and Chinese characters, but the other is a sort of raw particle board and not in a hip, exposed wood way. My friend and I grabbed a booth and decided on their half and half fried chicken ($28.99) in Soy Garlic and Spicy Sauce, as well as an order of the Garlic Butter Fries ($8.99). We took a while to order because we found the combos on the back of the menu a bit hard to navigate. TIP: it's actually meant as an alcohol + one dish pairing versus the multiple plates we were hoping/thinking of. 

The meal comes with complimentary sweet corn served on a hot plate, and three small side dishes of daikon, lettuce, and a tiny pinch of something resembling pickled cabbage. It took a while for the food to arrive, but it gave us time to catch up and whet the appetite. They were pretty busy with takeout and foodora orders all evening - it's clearly a neighbourhood favourite. When the chicken came, the portions were generous and good value. I'd recommend the two flavours we ordered because having both a crispy portion and a sauced up portion strikes a good balance. If I had to only order a single flavour, I think Spicy Sauce is the way to go. The Garlic Butter fries were nice to try, but I wouldn't order them again. They were crispy, but tasted of neither garlic nor butter. The closest thing I'd compare the flavour to are those weird, sweet creamed corn chips you find in Asian supermarkets. That's what I get for glancing at review highlights and not actually reading through beforehand - d'oh! 

Minor note: we found a tiny piece of steel wool clinging to a thigh of our Soy Garlic, which was offputting but not a dealbreaker (my friend still ate it).  

3.5 stars for an awesome alternative to your typical game night wings, especially since they deliver through third parties like foodora. Service was a little lacking, but we'll chalk it up to a busy takeout night this time (aka - the waitresses were really cute, so due slack was cut ^-^)."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was ok. The batter was quiet  thick but it wasn't bad. We had a pretty bad experience with the service tho. I better say there was no service at all. We had to ask for every single thing. They put the food down before we had any chopsticks, bowl and water cups. You think the waitress would look around the table and will notice that half of the people don't have a bowl and chopstick...nope...she turned around and never came back. I mean, we didn't expect a high class service and not even a smile but at least the basics should be served! It was just bad...I will not go back"}
{"text":"Went with 2 other friends on a a Tuesday night. Food was good. The fried chicken was amazing as were the fries. We got the soy sauce flavour one and the green onion one.The fries taste like those honey butter chips. My friend thought it tasted a little artifical thou. 

The place was packed on Tuesday night with only one waitress. So service was so so"}
{"text":"So happy to see the Fry opening closer in Richmond Hill.  Food and service were great.  It was quieter than others locations perhaps but food was fresh so an added bonus.  Would highly recommend green onion chicken.  Crispy yet tender."}
{"text":"I'm really excited to have the fry open up in Richmond hill. It's more convenient but I realized having expectations lead to disappointments. They have the same menu just like every other The fry. I ordered the half and half chicken with original and savoury spicy sauce with a side of cheese corn. The chicken came and there was barely any meat on the chicken.... it felt as if I was just chewing on flavoured chicken bones. There's also only one server on duty.... regardless of ever needing something it was hard to wave down the only girl on duty since she was always occupied with a full house. I also made reservations but clearly reservations don't seem to matter... kind of disappointed and I'm going to just stick back with the north york location."}
{"text":"Korean fried chicken can't go wrong. their batter is not too thick and it's very crispy. I love their soy garlic chicken!!! the combination of soy and garlic doesn't sound so appetizing, but it actually taste like dry honey garlic chicken with more flavors with out the sauce. I guess that's where the soy sauce punches in?"}
{"text":"The dark environment was the first \"wow\" for me. The Korean chicken was good, but not the best Korean Chicken I had. It is worth the money and time to check the place out."}
{"text":"A great place for hanging out with friends and having a beer. Will not recommend the cheese fries because the cheese tasted really weird. however for the quantity given with the price is great. They don't sell anything else other than fried chicken so if ur looking this place for dinner it might not be that great of an idea to go here."}
{"text":"? really did enjoy the atmosphere this little place has. People working here have such a good vibe. Small appy tray was nice, i loved the pickled radish. Mayo pasta thing was odd, and the shredded radish with some kind of spicy mayo was okay.

We ordered 3 small baskets. Not so small.

Fried chicken soy garlic was amazing. The fried in spicy sauce was okay too, too sweet for me.

Overall nice experience."}
{"text":"Always busy because the food is great. Corn is tasty. But pricey....  onion fried chicken is great too!!!   Service is always horrible. Lol!!  Always new staff it seems."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night craving of Korean fried chicken. The service was slow at first but the waitresses were polite. We order the invite including buttery corn and half a chicken with green onions and beer. 

Chicken was tender and crispy. 
The location is convenient for dt where I do live in north york with many Korean restos. Was dt so worked in my favour."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this place is really good! I thought it would be a regular wings place but as it turns out, I was wrong! The Fry had its own unique touch to their food and very delicious. The meat is tender and very soft and the Korean foods were very good as well. 

It is a very, very small place. There was only about 6 tables and only one waiter. It was very busy, but the food came out fairly quick. Although, the place is small, the place was nicely decorated and cozy. 

I would definitely recommend this to a friend! I would for sure revisit as this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Must try: Half and Half Chicken

The food is very consistent with other the Fry stores, the chicken I always get is original and spicy.

The service that we received was great. I can tell the girls are very busy and overloaded, but the waitress that worked our table always had a smile and got whatever we requested. I think it may be hit or miss.

I would definitely go if I want KFC and don't want to venture uptown.

DELIVERY REVIEW: via Foodora

Since I got delivery, my review focuses solely on the food and not the service aspect of this restaurant - which seems to play a large part in the lacklustre reviews below. 

I ordered a Special Half & Half Chicken meal in which you get to choose 2 flavours. 

Soy Garlic Chicken:
- the sauce was well-balanced and not overbearing

Fried Chicken in Spicy Sauce: 
- not too spicy, more of a tangy sweet spice 
- more saucy compared to the soy garlic one 

The fried chicken was not too oily so no need to dab on a napkin! The portion size was quite big - probably for 2 very hungry people or 3 hungry people. My colleagues often order this to share amongst themselves.

The Fry definitely passes our fried chicken test with frying colours!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little gem. The food, service and ambiance were all great!
We ordered a small boneless chicken with green onion and the spicy boneless chicken and the portions were gigantic, I believe a small portion is an entire chicken and a large is 2 chickens. I wish I had known that before I had ordered.

The restaurant is small but we didn't have to wait. We were seated right away and brought water and some complimentary appetizers. We got a side dish of some sizzling corn, and then a salad platter which consisted of a green salad, some pickled radish and some coleslaw. The chicken was a beautiful heaping portion of fried goodness. The green onion chicken was flavourful and crispy but didn't feel greasy. The spicy chicken was very spicy. I could only manage a few pieces. The radish and salad helps to cool down your mouth a bit, but the flavour is amazing. 

The value is really good considering the portion sizes and free side dishes. Our meal came out to around $40 or so but could have easily fed 3-4 people. 

The restaurant itself is dark and trendy, there's loud music playing in the background so it's not a good place for a quiet meeting. It's a small restaurant, there are only about 10 tables. There's free parking in the lot out front but it likely gets full during peak times. 

The service was good, everything came out quickly and we had no issues getting refills on the salads or water, especially considering our waitress might have been the only one waiting on customers. 

Overall, I can't wait to try more items, maybe some side dishes, the rice cakes look good, and maybe a different flavour of the chicken!"}
{"text":"Went to The Fry on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised to see not many customers. Overall, the experience went well. My family enjoyed the food and we left with our fried chicken cravings satisfied.
Total: 20/25

Customer Service: 4/5
- Friendly staff, helpful in explaining how to order
- (One indicator of great customer service is paying attention to customer beverages and to check on them in general)
- Our waitress did not pay much attention to our table even though there were few customers, leaving us thirsty and waiting for more water.

Food Taste: 4/5
- Ordered the Bacon Kimchi Fried Rice and the Special Half & Half Chicken (Soy Garlic/Fried Chicken in Sauce)
- Pleasantly surprised by the combination of Soy and Garlic as a flavor, was my preferred out of the two.
- The Fried Chicken in Sauce tasted great, very similar to the Chinese Sweet and Sour Pork flavor.
- The chicken is better not just wings, it contained many parts of the chicken so it satisfied my preference for more white meat, and my grandmother's preference for bone pieces.
- The Kimchi Fried Rice was tasty, the rice had a nice kimchi infused flavor and decent amount of bacon.
- Side dishes that came with the chicken rather plain, although the radish was great with the combination of chicken to refresh your palate.

Food Presentation/Portions: 4/5
- Presentation of all the foods were appealing (forgot to take pictures)
- Helpful bone bucket so easy to keep organize
- Took rather longer than expected for food to arrive consider customers in the restaurant
- Portion sizes were big & filling, the half chicken size is better than a pound of wings at your local bar.

Environment: 4/5
- Modern atmosphere, lighting hard to tell since I went in the afternoon. 
- Overall comfortable seating, could group larger parties
- Noticed Bar stools in the middle of the restaurant for more \"bar\" feeling
- Both T.Vs were not working

Price: 4/5
- A little more on the expensive side but the value is there
- The chicken is reasonable but the fried rice was not as great"}
{"text":"Sad to say that this restaurant is a little bit underrated. K-Pocha which is another location who offers KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN has a great contender now.

So glad we came across this restaurant. Their FRIED CHICKENS are amazing!!! We tried 3 different kinds so far...

And I would rate it as...

3rd - Green onion chicken 
2nd - Soy garlic chicken
1st - CRISPY FRIED CHICKEN !!!!!

Always made fresh to order. Comes with sizzling corn, and 3 extra sides which are refillable (coleslaw, salad, pickled cabbage)

Dont be fooled tho!!! Small portion of an order could already feed at least 2-3people. So make sure you think twice before ordering that large portion.


Usually, small (half chicken) costs $18.99-$19.99 per order. And a large (whole chicken) usually costs around $30-$31/order.


Tip: They dont sell rice here. So for all of my Asian friends there!!! Dont come in with expectations."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the chicken was great! The food is a bit on the pricier side but this is a great place to enjoy a greasy-chicken mess and then wash it down with some truly substandard beer. You may be asking yourself, \"Why would he give it only two stars?\". Well sit your assess back down on your saddles folks; half the battle of food is what happens after you eat it. 

Without going into the gory details we weren't exactly feeling great after our meals. I was hugging the ceramic throne the same way a hipster hugs their canvas knapsack at a flea market. It was bitter-sweet. I was feeling awful but the thought of the juicy chicken was worth it. 

All in all I would say going to the Fry is akin to getting a tetanus shot. You need it, but it sucks. Go once every 10 years. If only we could pay with out health-card  it would warrant a 3-star rating."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love KFC? Probably one of the best places to go for Korean fried chicken! 
This is a small restaurant with limited parking so we had to park on the side streets. The interior of this place is nice and dim, with rustic decor. The service here was amazing, there were only 2 waitresses but the place is small so it makes sense, they were very attentive and came back to check on us if we needed refills or anything else. The chicken here is so yummy, it has the perfect amount of crispiness but also very soft and tender on the inside. We got the large green onion boneless chicken and I personally think that is the best one out of all of the chicken selections. 
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this is my first time trying Korean fried chicken here in Toronto and I liked it honestly. I can't compare with other Korean fried chicken restaurants cuz I've never tried any. Good place to go when my Asian genes crave for green onion rather than honey garlic! Us four people ordered one large boneless green onion and one large spciy sauce but almost couldn't finished all cuz the portion was so huge.
.
The most popular green onion is definitely my fav, crispy and not soggy, green onion goes really well with the sauce, everything is just so good when all combined together. The spicy sauce is a bit too spicy that I could only had three pieces with glasses of water...the only thing I'd complain about their chicken is that it wasn't juicy enough but unlike Popeyes chicken, their chicken is in smaller pieces so even though it's not as juicy as Popeyes chickens are, it doesn't taste like super dry chicken breast especially topping up with the sauce.
.
On the side, they gave us pickled radish, cabbages, salad, and CORN CHEESE!!! I love corn cheese but so sad that you can't get it refilled..
I'll definitely come again in the future to try out their other flavour!! Maybe in different locations though!!"}
{"text":"Literally so bad. The only slack I'd have to cut them is that we showed up at midnight (granted, it was Saturday and relatively empty, so we thought we could get served quickly). Regardless, we ended up waiting almost an hour for our food, which, despite the long wait (I ordered fried BBQ chicken in sauce), was unpalatable. A third of what I ate was burnt fryer crud, a third was cartilage, and then one third was chicken. Furthermore, the waitress assumed that nearly everything I asked her about would be \"too spicy\" for me (for the record, what I ordered was not spicy whatsoever, despite her stating the contrary), which did feel was condescending. No tip!"}
{"text":"This place has limited amount of seats (say around 30 people can fit in here).  Both times, i have been here, they only have one waiter working.  That didn't stop me from coming, their fried chicken is crispy and juicy.  We came here with a group of 6-8 people, ordered a variety of chicken.  My favourite would be the green onion chicken, loads of green onion mix with a sweet sauce.  It also comes with a complimentary butter corn, salad and pickle radish.  It was busy both nights we were here, but it didn't stop the waiter from topping up our salad and pickle radish, unfortunately there's no top up for butter corn.  Great place to grab drinks and fried chicken with your friends for a little catching up (just talks, no tv inside!)"}
{"text":"This is usually my go-to Korean fried chicken spot, so I was slightly disappointed by my most recent visit.

When we asked the server what the sauce for \"chicken with sauce\" was she said \"SAUCE\". WHAT KIND OF SAUCE? Please specify!

Also, the service was very slow. I had to get up to ask the server for water 2 times because she always stood at the back of the restaurant where she couldn't see us.

The food was average, but the \"chicken with sauce\" was a little lacking as the flavour was too strong. We enjoyed the garlic onion chicken the most!"}
{"text":"Such great fried chicken! The half and half combo with beer is great (serves 4). I always get the regular fried chicken and the spicy sauce one. It's crazy spicy, but sweet tasting and delicious so worth the burn. Gets really busy between 7 and 9, but you can leave your number at the door and go a couple of doors down for a drink while you wait. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My favourite Korean green onion boneless fried chicken place. I ONLY recommend this dish and the butter garlic fries if you are going to be eating here. 

The fry is a place to socialize over delicious fried foods and an assortment of Korean Street food for sharing.

First, they welcome you with an assortment of cold side dishes. This includes their sweet cubed pickled radishes, green salad, and cole slaw. Some of the yummiest side dishes to accompany a nice bite of green onion chicken! (As a side note, ask them to refill it if you run out). 

Each table also gets their own sizzling hot buttered corn. While this dish isn't refillable, it's delicious Korean buttered corn which most places don't offer as a side. 

Finally, the food. Again, only order the boneless green onion fried chicken. We once had the misfortune of eating normal green onion fried chicken which was drier and not as juicy as the boneless version. 

Also, if you're a sauce person, ask for some extra on the side. 

Each piece is lightly battered and juicy. It's meant to be eaten with the shredded green onions, so don't be afraid to take a bite of them together! 

Also, if you like honey butter flavoured things, you won't be disappointed by the butter garlic fries which are a MUST every time we go.

All in all, in love with the green onion chicken here! 

Service is a hit or miss sometimes depending on who's there though; hence, 4 stars"}
{"text":"Real korean style of fried chicken?The price is worthy cause of the huge volume. Here is pretty crowded during night. So?it's better to take an reservation"}
{"text":"The Fry was my first introduction to Korean fried chicken, and I was definitely impressed with my experience here both service and food-wise. My friends and I had fried chicken in sauce, spicy sauce, and soy garlic. All these orders were great, with the spicy sauce having just the right amount of heat. The spicy rice cake on the other hand was a bit too much, but I still enjoyed it regardless. As for the side dishes, the restaurant provided radish cubes, pasta salad, coleslaw, and corn, all of which were well prepared and tasted good.

I recommend eating here with a small group of maybe 3-6, as you'll be able to try more menu items together shared as a group. Furthermore, the restaurant is a bit compact and dimly lit, which can make accommodating for larger groups more difficult.

All in all, I would definitely try The Fry if you're looking for a place to eat Korean fried chicken. This location had very friendly staff, and the food came relatively quickly despite the restaurant being full."}
{"text":"We got takeout garlic fries, not sure what happened today but the fries they gave us were three times smaller than what they were a year ago, absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends. If you cannot eat fried food, don't come here because 99% of the items on the menu are fried related (since it's called the Fry lol). Not a big fan of their crispy chicken. I find it tasteless. You can get better crispy chicken elsewhere for sure. But their chicken with sauce is pretty good! So i highly recommend that. Spicy one is too spicy to my taste and most of my friends'. So if you can eat spicy, you will like this too! It was really cold the day I went..hopefully it's not the case anymore. Overall, it's an OK experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Korean fried chicken at a restaurant, so take it with a grain of salt. 

We arrived at around 8pm, on a Saturday (they don't take reservations) and this place was packed! Granted we were a large group, so we had to wait a while for a table. 

We chose the spicy chicken, soy chicken, crispy chicken with green onions, and garlic butter fries. Along with the combo came bottles of their homemade grapefruit and yogurt soju. They even gave us this roasted corn dish on the house!

The spicy chicken (classic) was the best and most flavourful. The outside had a thin but crispy batter, and the chicken was very juicy on the inside. Personally I like a little more spice, but it was definitely tasty. To be honest I expected the batter to be a little firmer and more crunchy, but again, I'm  a kfc newbie. 

The garlic butter fries were kind of bittersweet experience for me. While they were very good, they didn't quite fit my flavour profile. The fries were crispy, and came in this buttery sweet sauce, and with ketchup on the side. I'm not really a fan of sweet tasting fries, but all my friends found them exceptional!

The corn was kind of bland, but the sauerkraut and pickled radishes they serve with the chicken provide a nice acidity cut from all the fried food. 

Service here was a little slow, and we had to remind them a couple times for missing drinks/water. But I don't blame them. They only had 2 servers in a tiny but full restaurant. 

Overall a good experience. A small hole-in-the wall type restaurant with some really good fried chicken."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday around 6 and it was packed. The service was pretty good even with just 1.5 servers basically.  

We got the special half and half chicken. It is TONS of chicken. Seems like way more than say a loblaws chicken. One half chicken with spicy sauce and the other half was soy chicken. Very crispy and moist inside for both. 

Also had the butter fries - I feel like asian style fries taste funky like captains boil fries are kinda funky not sure I can recommend these. Just kinda weird fries no idea how they fry it.

Try the yogurt soju. You can drink tons of this stuff. It is so good.  

Overall a good experience 4.5/5 rounded down. There's also a hidden patio in the back."}
{"text":"Went to The Fry a while back, as it was one of a few places that were still open on the holidays, craving Korean Fried Chicken. When you go to a Korean chicken joint, there are two dishes you NEED to get:

- Fire Chicken (cubed pieces of white meat chicken coated in a sweet and very spicy sauce)
- Korean Fried Chicken w/ Green Onion (large pieces of boneless fried chicken with a healthy handful of green onion & dressing)

Albeit, we were there when they were out of the Fire Chicken, so we just opted to get the latter instead. The Korean Fried Chicken is light and satisfyingly crispy - pair it with bites of green onion for that hint of freshness and dressing for that slight sweet tang.

Waitress we had was very nice, but because they were short staffed, you may be waiting a bit for your food."}
{"text":"Okay so this is my second time here and the first time I was here was a very long time ago and I don't really remember my experience. So yesterday was my second time back and before coming here I wanted to read up on some of the reviews. And boy were these reviews bad lol. Don't get me wrong many of you said the food was great but the service was super slow. I was really hesitant to come here because of that. But because we had just finished watching a show many restaurants had closed or were nearly closing. So we decided to give it a go.

My boyfriend and I got here around 10:40p.m. so it had already died down. We were seated instantly and the waitress had taken our order once we decided what we wanted. We didn't even wait long for our food to come out as well. Food was delicious, waitress was kind and attentive, and the food came out quickly.

So not sure what everyone was complaining about the service being slow. The only complaint I may have was the garlic butter fries. Are they usually that sweet? I had a hard time eating it because I wasn't really fond of the taste. Other than that everything was great. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant with friends. It was already quite busy, thank god we reserved a table. We ordered TWO of the same combo from the 3 combos that you could pick. All combos came with either 4 domestic beers or grapefruit/ citron soju. We picked the grapefruit soju for both (they are HOMEMADE). It also came with a plate of sizzling cheesy corn and side dishes- pickled radishes, coleslaws, shredded cabbage w/ 1000 island dressing. The chicken were crispy and juicy. Really tender too. We ordered original, soy garlic, house special, and a spicy one. The house special was the perfect amount of spicy, but a little bit too sweet (reminded me of a spicy version of orange chicken). We also ordered the original dobokki (korean rice cake). It was a little too spicy for us, but the flavour was really enough and the rice cake were the perfect amount of chewiness. Overall experience was good, will definitely go again

PRO:
- Homemade soju was not as sweet as the store-bought ones, still enough that you can taste the soju and the grapefruit
- corns were really sweet
- can refill the side dishes ('cause they are THAT good)
- pickled radishes were not so sour or overpowering
- great for catching up with friends or a date!!

CON:
- not enough cheese flavour in the corn
- CANNOT RESERVE if you have a party more than 6 people
- a little pricey for FRIED CHICKEN to be honest"}
{"text":"The chicken is really good, a decent place for friends gathering and casual night out. However, it is kind of dark inside. It is hard to read the menu. There is not much to read anyway, the selection is kind of limited.

We ordered larger fried chicken with green onion and fish cake soup. They comes pretty quick after order. The food portion is pretty good. A large dish can serve around people. The fish cake soup is average. 

The service is so so. The server tends to ignore you after you ordered. The overall experience is good, and would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Not many Korean Fried Chicken restaurants in Markham east of Bayview Ave. so this is certainly a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. The restaurant was quite tame for a Tuesday evening, which allowed the food to come to our table quicker. I had the fried chicken in sweet and spicy sauce. Half the chicken is quite a bit and was plenty for me. The flavours were great, though mostly sweet and the slightest hint of spicy gives the chicken dimension. I did not order boneless, but they do a very good job of reducing the amount of bones you have to pick through anyway. 

The service at times was slow, as they seemed to only have one server for the entire restaurant tonight. The four sides of corn, pickled raddish, coleslaw, and \"salad\" (cabbage strands with sauce) were all right. The coleslaw and salad seem a bit redundant. However, the portions for the sides were small, and there were no refills. The corn was also either undercooked, or came out of the freezer to the pan as they were tough to chew through. Hoping the bon-chan will be better next time."}
{"text":"The chicken is pricey and without the sauce it has absolutely no taste. Also it taste like frozen meat that was taken from the freezer and thrown into the deep fryer. I mean seriously. Come on."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars. 
We ordered the special half & half where you get to pick two different types of chicken off their list. We tried the spicy fried chicken and the crispy chicken. The spicy chicken was pretty spicy, so make sure you can handle the heat. Their crispy chicken is not tossed in any sauce, but you can ask for sauce on the side and they will give your their house special sauce. It comes with some salt and pepper on the side as well, but be careful not to sprinkle too much. 
Overall, chicken was very tender and crispy. The crispy chicken was a little too battered for my liking (like Popeyes crispy). But the meat was very moist and soft. The half & half also comes in pretty big portions. I think it can feed about 3 people (average eaters). 
The sauce flavours (spicy & house special side sauce)  in my opinion tasted very similar except one was spicy. They both have a sweet kick to it. 
This place also offers complimentary side dishes. They give you buttered corn on a sizzling plate which is pretty unique. And their coleslaw was surprisingly really good! 
The only thing about this place is that it's quite small, not really good for groups. The whole place prolly seats around 20-25 people.  As well, I wish our side dishes was brought out to us earlier and not almost at the same time as our chicken."}
{"text":"Went to The Fry on a weeknight, so the place was not that busy.  I was pretty surprised that the setup of the restaurant was a pub style.  I guess that is how it is in Korea.  Anyways i came there for the famous KFC (korean fried chicken).  We ordered the fried chicken with green onion, fried chicken with special sauce, fried calamari and fries.  

The fries: were your typical fries, it somehow tasted like costco fries.  Anybody else notice that? 

Fried Calamari:  it was fried perfectly but lacked seasoning. Could've used some salt and pepper.

Green onion fried chicken:  first of, i have never seen so much green onion on dish.  There was actually more green onion than chicken.  But kidding aside the green actually tasted really good with the chicken. 

Fried chicken with special sauce:  this was the best dish we had.  The chicken was breaded and fried perfectly.  You can hear the crunch everytime you bite into it.  And sauce had perfect harmony of sweet, sour and spicy.

Overall the experience was good.  Service could use some improvement.  Food was decent, but on the pricey side.  This locale is more of an adult pub rather than a family restaurant."}
{"text":"First time at The Fry and it was great. The fried chicken is better than other Korean places like House of Hot Taste in my opinion. The portions were big and the flavour was great. The chicken comes out freshly fried so it takes a while longer than your 'typical Asian restaurant', but it's worth it. It's piping hot but not greasy. Will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Who would ever say no to fried chicken and beer?

Actually - oddly enough I might since I am not a super huge fan of chicken, and usually only like it when its fried, or in a sandwich masked with a ton of toppings.

But, this place has succeeded and dissolved a little bit more of my distaste for the ugly bird!

We ordered the half&half - comes with 1/2 plain fried chicken and 1/2 spicy saucy chicken. Both were amazing and I still can't pick the winner. The plain was super crispy, moist and tender inside, and the batter tasted amazing. The spicy was nice and saucy while the batter was still crispy. It is very spicy though so be warned! 

The price point for this + a pitcher of beer (korean combo style) was about $26-$30 and well worth it. Two of us only made it through half of the chicken (one of us being a boy with a very healthy appetite) and we had a ton of leftovers. Another perk - the chicken is cut up in many different ways so you get some wing, some bones, some nuggets, big and small pieces... a great variety.

Comes with your typical K-side dishes such as salad and delicious corn on a hot plate.

Service was just alright which is why I gave it a 4.

Will be back! Give it a try when you are in the area, or there is another location just down the road at Yonge and Cummer which tends to be a lot less busy :)"}
{"text":"Living downtown, there aren't a lot of places where u can get Korean fried chicken. Home of hot taste used to be my go to spot but in the past few years the quality really went down. 

I've tried the fry in North York and it was so so, but I've been wanting to try this location out for a long time... And super glad I did. Got the half half original and the spicy sweet sauce. Ugh so good. Perfect for after drinks. 

One star off because the seating situation is pretty terrible."}
{"text":"Poor service and mediocre food. We went in and the hostess showed us to the tiny two seater right next to the entrance, in this weather? I don't think so. She later offered us a bigger table after she'd done cleaning it, mind you she was the only person working front of the house. She gave us the menu, and went back to attending others, and took a long time before she came back to take our orders. We got the special half and half, original and spicy friend chicken (the total amounts to 1 whole chicken). The price was $28.99 and came with side dishes (a small plate of corn cheese with radish and 2 types of salads). The food took a while to get here, though the side dishes came quickly enough. The fried chicken was not what I was expecting at all since I've heard great things about Korean fried chicken The original flavour was not crisp at all, maybe even a little salty. The spicy flavoured was extremely spicy, which threw me off guard since I do especially well with spice. Therefore, if you can't take the heat, do not order this. The corn cheese was really savoury( a mix of sweet and salty) a good balance, children would definitely enjoy this one! Service wise was also poor, and the overall atmosphere as well. Lighting was extremely poor, it's a decorative thing but definitely wrecks the mood, cramped space and the stairs to the washroom downstairs is also another killer. Funny story: I walked into the women's washroom to find an old Korean man taking a dump. They had a private women and men's washroom, no individual stalls. Last thing- the change took a while to get back to us. And since we were in a rush, that was the last straw. Anyways overall rating is fair."}
{"text":"The Green Onion Wings were really good, I was not a big fan of the spicy or soy garlic wings here as I had better.

The appetizer platter and the corn were a very pleasant surprise. The corn is AMAZING. The coleslaw was great too.

The waitress was very kind, smiling and accommodating. 

Place was a bit too dark and different than what I'm personally used to, which took away from the experience a bit."}
{"text":"Heard many things about \"korean fried chicken\"- finally tried it and I can say I'm a fan, but only because I love fried chicken. Would I come back here if I'm craving fried chicken again? Potentially... but I'd also be ok with grabbing wings at a regular pub/bar. The side dishes were great- the corn was a nice extra touch. Lots of people raved about the green onion but I didn't think it was too flavourful or special. We got the non-spicy special sauce, which was my favourite of the 2. I would love to get a spicy one next time as well. It was fairly easy to grab a table on a Sunday night at 7pm- but it was still fairly full. Definitely reserve if you have a large group."}
{"text":"Waited 45 mins for 3 bottles of soju. The waitress completely forgot about us despite it being a pretty quiet night. When we walked up to the counter to tell then we're leaving, they just starred blankly at us and shrugged. Never coming back. There are plenty of places to eat on bloor"}
{"text":"Bad experience ever, bad food bad server.There fried chicken was nothings on it but crispy parts. The waiters looks like own the restaurant, bad manners."}
{"text":"Quite happy to see that The Fry opens up in Richmond Hill and even offers lunch special!

Basket of Half Chicken ($15) in Spicy Savoury Sauce
- 3 big pieces of chicken: 3 Joint Wing, Leg and Thigh
- I would prefer to have chicken chopped up in smaller pieces. Though all the pieces were juicy but sadly not enough surfaces to be coated with sauces and a little tricky to eat
- The sides offerings was excellent includes banchans and even a plate of sizzling corn

If I come back, I probably will opt for the boneless as the waitress said the boneless consists of all dark meat!

This is good option for lunch if you are in the area, especially you want to have some KFC!"}
{"text":"A lot of people recommended this place to me, but when I went there I found everything to be mediocre. The chicken was moist and tender but the flavour was surprisingly lacking. The sauce wasn't memorable and for the price point, you can find better."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is mainly because the food was incredibly delicious. The chicken was ridiculously good and I could eat their garlic butter fries forever! The service was meh but was seriously overshadowed by how crispy and juicy their fried chicken was. Will come back. Excited to eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here for Korean BBQ - was a quite Sunday lunch time when we arrived. Overall the experience was good and the food was at the expected level. Not the best Korean BBQ place in Toronto but good. 

A good option in the Yonge/Steeles area."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday with a bunch of my friends and we all left thinking that we had better.  Everything we ordered had a certain issue with it.  Fries weren't crispy, Green Onion Chicken was crispy but dry, Soy Garlic Chicken was moist but soggy, and their Fried Chicken in Sauce was average.  The best part of this meal was their side dishes which is standard among all other Korean Restaurants around the area.  The service we had was slow as there were only two employees working the dining area and cash register.  Overall I feel that there are better options around Yonge Street."}
{"text":"Had a take-out order. Everything was fresh made, so it took time to wait. The chicken is very crispy and the home made sauce was so awesome!"}
{"text":"I found the mirrored glass in the front a little off-putting, but Yelp convinced me to give it a go.

Inside was much nicer than the mirrored glass would suggest. I got the half and half chicken for two people, at the server's suggestion. The spicy was more sweet than spicy, which isn't really my thing, but that's a personal preference and I know I'm an outlier. There was a ton of chicken.

If you're in the neighborhood, this is a pretty solid option. I'm not much for fried chicken, but every once in a while I get a craving, so I'll probably be back to check out this patio they supposedly have."}
{"text":"The Fry is one of the newest restaurants in the Yonge and Sheppard area. I am not sure why they would open up to two locations within walking distance from one another, but there's a second location on Yonge/Finch. The Fry specializes in Korean-style fried chicken, which is basically a fried chicken dish prepared in a Korean style. 

After we ordered our food, our server brought us a plate of side dishes of green salad, white radish, and macaroni salad. We were also given a hot plate of seared corn. We ordered the special half & half chicken ($27.99) - fried chicken, and fried chicken in spicy sauce, as our main dish. I'd say that this dish was more than enough for two people, as we left with a few leftover pieces. The fried chicken in spicy sauce was true to its name, as it was rather spicy and flavorful. Additionally, I liked that the chicken pieces were evenly coated in the sauce. 

The second chicken dish that came with the combo was the fried chicken, which was a generous portion of pieces. Korean Fried Chicken is fried twice, and this results in the skin being crispier. The chicken skin was indeed crispy and perfectly spiced, and the meat was juicy on the inside. This way of deep drying also creates a lot less grease all over the chicken. Lastly, as a side, we got the crispy French fries ($6.99. I loved these lightly battered fries, as they were very crispy, and not oily at all. Overall, The Fry was a great introduction to Korean Fried Chicken for me, as I have never tried it before. I enjoyed our meal, and left pretty stuffed until the next morning."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend because I felt like eating Korean fried chicken, and I am SO glad I came here. It's a small place located near Yonge and Finch. It's has a bar feel to it. You can order pretty much just beer and fried chicken and other korean side dishes. Their main thing is their fried chicken though. 

They start you off with side dishes of salad, raddishes and macaroni + cheese. The raddishes help to cool things down and tastes very refreshing when you're eating the chicken. 

We ordered the half and half, so we got a mix of regular fried chicken, and the spicy chicken. We also ordered tteokboki, since we both love korean rice cakes. 

The tteokboki was soo spicy, but so good. It is very spicy, so beware! The spiciest place I've ever tried, but it tasted so good. Luckily, the raddishes we had helped to save our tongues. 

The regular fried chicken without sauce was really good. Much better than the usual fried chicken. Moist chicken deep fried with a crunchy crispy outside. It also came with sauces on the side, one was a sweet and spicy sauce, the other was just salt. The chicken tastes good on it's own too. 

The spicy chicken wasn't too spicy, and there was just enough sauce on it that it wasn't dripping all over the place, but not too little that you would need more. The chicken for this was also very moist and crispy, even though it had sauce all over it. 

Near the end, the waitress came by and gave us some corn. The best corn I've ever had. Super sweet and I think it's stir fried with butter. The corn itself was very sweet though. 

This is definitely a place I'd go back to with some friends (not too many since it's really small), to just chill and have beer and wings."}
{"text":"I was really excited to hop on this korean fried chicken craze but it doesn't seem all that great to me. The atmosphere is great, it makes you feel like you're in the middle of Seoul but the lighting could be brighter. Waiters are not very attentive and patrons are constantly requesting to be moved from the door to avoid the winter draft. Although pricy, their portions are humongous! The 1/2 chicken is way too much for one person, definitely a sharing type of place. I liked the original fried chicken with green onion but their \"special sauce\" chicken tasted just like honey garlic wings. Overall, I don't see myself returning as the food was quite mediocre and not as unique as I expected."}
{"text":"Sweet. Cooksville is beginning to turn into your next Korea town! Super happy that The Fry opened a store up in Sauga - now I don't need to trek down to North York to try. I've been meaning to try this place for a while (not sure exactly when this opened up). I came by on a Monday evening around 6pm with a party of 4. There's prob about 10 total tables? and 2 booths which we were seated at. The shop isn't that big it's pretty small. Actually the size is a little smaller than kpocha in terms of seating. 
We browsed the online menu before so we knew what we wanted to eat. 

We ordered the L boneless green onion fried chicken. S secret savoury sauce. Spicy rice cakes + cheese (+$2). Few minutes after we made the order, the waitress came out with sweet cheese that was sizzzzzlinngg hot and a long appetizer dish with radishes, salad and coleslaw. The corn was the best! Just be careful and let it chill a bit cause it burnt my friends tongue LOL. 

The spicy rice cakes came out first and this was good! Nothing too amazing, they tastes similar to Kpocha and Mymy chicken but good $ for it's portion. We added cheese to it to soften the spice and it wasn't spicy to me. Just good enough and my company enjoyed this. I wanted to add noodles only if it was glass noodles but waitress said it's udon only so only opted for cheese. The only thing I didn't like that much was the fish cakes.. smelt and tasted a bit toooo seafoody so I only had a few pieces. 

Next the S secret savoury bone-in fried chicken came. The small is half size. Still preetty big in portions. It tasted like a sweet semi spicy sauce. I'm not a fan of super saucy fried chicken so this was only ok to me. 

Finally, the L boneless green onion fried chicken came and this was huge. This was good! The wasabi sauce wasn't that overpowering and it didn't bother me. BUT I personally find the green onion fc tastes better elsewhere. 

Service was good. Just need to get up if you wanted to get someones attention as the booth backs are so high, you can't see them if you don't stand out of it.

Regardless, I would come back!"}
{"text":"Must try the fried chicken (not greasy at all) and sauce (a combination of spicy, sour, sweet) that goes with the fried chicken!  And I like their side dishes."}
{"text":"This was legitimately one of the worst dining experiences I've had in Toronto. I'm not sure if Korean fried chicken is normally sweet (the spicy garlic and cheese wings, as well as the spicy sauce wings were both sweet, much to our surprise and disgust), but I was not anticipating the butter and garlic fries to be sweet as well (honey-flavored?), which turned off my appetite completely. In fairness, everyone has different food preferences and taste buds, so let me get to the real reason my experience was rock bottom. 

Upon entering, we waited around hoping someone would eventually appear to seat us. We waited five minutes before even seeing a waitress, who we had to flag down to be seated.

She drops some menus off at our table shortly after we sit, and abandons us within seconds. Classy.

A few minutes later she pops by, asking if we're ready, to which we replied yes. The waitress turns and starts walking away; I yell, \"excuse me, we're ready\". She walks back over and stares at us. We proceed to order awkwardly.

The butter garlic fries came first. We inquire why it was sweet - the waitress replies without sympathy, \"this is not what you wanted?\" And we say, \"no, we thought it would be salty\". She shrugs and mutters \"sorry\", then turns and walks away. Doesn't offer any alternatives or suggestions.

After eating, we make three attempts to flag this waiter down to pay our bills. My first friend makes eye contact with the waitress and says, \"excuse me\". My friend is ignored.

My second friend flags her down while the waitress walks by, who proceeds to a different table before returning to ours (without acknowledgement). This tells me the waitress clearly heard and saw my friend, but ignored him to attend to the other table first.

After requesting our bills, the waitress disappears, and returns with boxes for our food. No bills. As she turns away hastily, I frustratingly yell out, \"EXCUSE ME! .. Can we please have our bills?\" She comes back over and says she'll bring them, but we have to pay up front.

At this point I was thoroughly displeased with the food and service as a whole and just want to leave. I'm sad to admit that I'm a very generous but simultaneously vindictive tipper - I easily and frequently will tip up to 20% on a meal if the service is even modestly appeasing, however if my experience is as unpleasant as the one I had at The Fry on Yonge and Sheppard, I will tip nothing. When the girl who rung up my bill saw I had not tipped, she muttered \"service charge is not included\". Not hearing fully (her voice drowned out by the blaring music) I asked her to repeat herself. \"Service charge is not included in your total\" she remarks flatly, looking at me with expectation. I stare her in the eye and respond equally as unimpressed, \"I know\", waiting for her to ask why I chose not to tip, and ready to provide feedback. She stares at me, then rips my receipt off the machine and tosses it aside and proceeds to cash out my friend. She clearly did not give a damn about her customers, much like the waitress who served us. 

I'm extremely glad I did not tip and will not be returning to this establishment. I hope others will not share the same experience I had yesterday."}
{"text":"Summary: good fried chicken, a bit pricy.
Recommend: fried chicken, non-spicy ones
Not Recommend: everything else in the menu

I went to here once because I was craving for fried chicken. I really like the fried chicken here, mainly because I love the sauce. The portion is good, enough for 4 people. However, we ordered a seafood soup, which is definitely not worth it.
I ordered both spicy and non-spicy favours. The spicy here tasted synthetic.
Maybe because I went during night time, I found interior decor of this place is dark and groomy somehow.
I would probably go to this place again when I am craving for fried chicken with group of 3 or more friends."}
{"text":"Best friend and I decided to hang out after our movie and found this little spot by the area.

When we're normally at Yonge and Sheppard we tend go to Nome or Han Ba Tang but today we decided to try something new.

There isn't enough staff to serve the guests and the AC is way way too cold. 

Food- to be continued."}
{"text":"Where do I start? First item we ordered was the fried chicken in sauce. The sauce wasn't amazing but it does grow on you after eating it multiple times. I assume there sauce has a hint of tobasco? And the rest I don't know but overall, sweet and little spice. The second item was the soy garlic chicken. Lord it was good, no complaints. I love dry rub meat. The second item was the garlic butter fries, it's not a new concept but it tasted good along with the fried chicken. We got three small side dishes and sizzling corn plate. I would definitely come back. Service was good. May wait a little bit to be seated during high peak times like \"dinner time.\""}
{"text":"The food was amazing, I love fried chicken and the corn was absolutely delicious. However,  the service is not the best. The wait staff is forgetful and not as attentive as I would like. Also the restaurant is cold, we were in jackets the majority of our dinner"}
{"text":"I walked in and there was no one to seat us but the waitress was very attentive afterwards. My friend and I ordered the small scallion boneless chicken and damn I was impressed. I thought they accidentally brought out a large size. The chicken was unbelievably crispy. I never anything like it before. We had leftovers and it was still crispy the morning after. They give you a corn mayo skillet, Cole slaw, macaroni, and radish as sides and the portions are abundant. We also ordered the yogurt soju and I thought it was just ok. I would definitely return for the scallion chicken."}
{"text":"Great Korean style fried chicken, with all kind of combo in the menu. Recommend to every Korean food lover!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came to The Fry on a Monday night. It was my first time trying any of the locations but my friends had been before. There were only one or two other tables. My friends had already told me that this is not the best location but I kept an open mind as I wouldn't have anything to compare it to anyways.

I enjoyed the laidback and relaxed atmosphere - dim lighting, casual, with upbeat pop music playing in the back. There was a gentleman and a lady working in the front. The lady was the one helping us for the most part but we could tell she was new and her English wasn't great. Every time we asked a question, she had to go ask the gentleman behind the counter for help. I wanted to use the ladies' room but the door didn't lock. I tried to tell them but they didn't understand me...

Our order came to $89 for four people:

Half and Half Combo (comes with corn with cheese + homemade We chose a bottle of Grapefruit Cocktail Soju (made in-house, regularly $18.99). I thought that there was nothing special about the regular fried chicken. The other one was very sweet and a little too saucy for my liking. I can't say I liked either one more than the other because neither really appealed to me. They were friendly, bu

Spicy Rice Cake - We asked for less spicy and they were able to accommodate. This was soft and chewy; a great texture and a good enough portion.

Egg (Rolled) - Really, just normal egg rolled up and I didn't think this was worth it at ~$14. 

Overall, the food just wasn't suitable for my taste and it ended up being $50 per couple, which I didn't think was worth it. I know this is largely due to the bottle of soju, but still. I would not return."}
{"text":"TLDR: YUM! Who doesn't love fried chicken?

My friends and I came here on a Sunday evening around 7PM and were seated right away. It's a small restaurant with maybe 3 large tables (seating 6-8 person/table), and maybe 6 smaller tables (2 person/table). 

For the four of us, we ordered the full green onion boneless chicken combo, which comes with your choice of soju (grapefruit, citrus, yogurt) or four beers - we got the yogurt soju. We also got the garlic butter fries and spicy bbq chicken with cheese on top. Comes with complementary butter corn, pickled radish, coleslaw, Korean coleslaw. 

Off the bat, the fried chicken is delicious, made fresh when ordered, yum! Unlike most places, you actually find pieces of chicken under the batter! It was delicious! 

Garlic butter fries... if you don't like sweet and savoury, this might not be for you. It was more like a sweet dish than what you would expect as garlic fries :P

Spicy bbq chicken with cheese, comes out piping hot! It isn't actually that spicy (coming from someone who doesn't eat spicy things), it was good, but the portion is a lot smaller than we thought. 

Anyways, their fried chicken is delicious, so try it out :)"}
{"text":"I was super excited to hear that the Fry was opening in Mississauga. The store is not very big, but it was comfortable. There were several people in there before us, but other than that it was pretty empty (mind you, we also went on a Monday night). 

We ordered the half & half--half original, half soy garlic. The serving size was bigger than we expected and can probably be shared amongst 4 people. I really enjoyed the original chicken, it was crunch and the meat was tender and delicious! The soy garlic was good too but it thought that it was not as crispy as the original. 

The appetizers were delicious! I enjoyed the butter corn & white radish. I would come back just for the corn. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place! Service was nice and friendly and food came at a decent time!"}
{"text":"Chicken was crispy and flavourful.  The spicy chicken is extremely spicy. A few friends who can take the heat had tried it and found it spicy.  They don't accept takeout orders until 5pm. Wait time about 30 mins."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and the food is good. Especially the boneless green onion chicken and the garlic fries. However, I ordered take out today 30 mind in advance and the waitress told us to wait another 10 minutes after arriving but we waited around 30 minutes. It was annoying."}
{"text":"Had the garlic butter fries, green onion fried chicken, wings, and the egg roll. The garlic butter fries were amazing! They had a lot of flavour and the fries were very crispy. The green onion fried chicken was good but it didn't really stand out to me enough to want to go back for it again. The wings were good at first but the sauce made the wings soggy so maybe it would be better if they had the sauce on the side. The egg roll was the most unsatisfying since it tasted like something I could make at home. We had ordered the egg roll with cheese but it didn't even taste like there was cheese in it. The egg roll is definitely not worth it in my opinion. 

The service here wasn't good either. It took the waitress forever just to bring us water - there were really little people in the restaurant at the time too. 

I think this place is worth a try but I doubt I'll come back again. I haven't tried the other locations before so maybe those ones are better."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 other friends on Thursday December 21 in the evening at around 8.

The first thing that I noticed were the earth toned interior with wood accents and edison lights which gave the space a very warm and welcoming feel the place especially in the cold weather. I dig it.

I also noticed that for some reason the table we were seated at was composed of two tables with one of them being about half an inch higher than the other one with a significant wobble. Kind of annoying and could have been easily fixed by exchanging with one from a 2 person booth but I'm not going to base this review on that. 

Anyway, we were starving and quickly ordered boneless green onion chicken, soy garlic chicken, and original. The waitress may have forgotten to ask us if we wanted drinks at this point because we had to hunt her down later in the night as ask her for water. Food came out promptly it was finger lickin' good as always...and that's about when service from the servers ended.  The food and ambiance are the only reasons this isn't a one star review. 

For the rest of the night we got absolutely zero attention. Not even once did our waitress come around and ask us how the food was or if we needed anything else. We had to flag down a waitress to get some water and we got one jug which was never refilled for the rest of the night.

The whole time these two waitresses would be hiding behind the cashier barricade chit-chatting instead of keeping watch on the dining room. The layout of the place is linear so one could quickly glance around from time to time and see if any patrons need anything but apparently taking care of customers was not on the menu tonight. 

My thirsty ass needed some water yo. Now it seems like the simple solution would be to flag down these lazy waitresses every time I needed something but on principle I should not have to do such a thing as I would like to think I'm in a restaurant dining room and not a food court. 
 
Considering the dining room is about 10 meters end to end with a maximum of about 40 patrons it seems mind boggling that the waitresses can't walk from one end to the other and check on their 20 patrons every 10 mins or so and refill waters. It takes a special kind of stupid to fail at such a simple task.

Later on in the night we had to flag down the waitress for another order and then once again for the bill. The waitress never even asked us if we wanted separate or on the the same bill and had to redo it. Then after giving us the bill she never told us we had to pay at the front so we sat around for a while. HOW HARD IS IT TO SAY 6 WORDS? I never knew my meal came with a side of puzzles that I needed to solve in order to pay and leave.

So after receiving abysmal, piss-poor, almost non-existent service I think to myself you know what? I ain't tipping. I get better service at Mcdonald's for god sake. I pay and my waitress has the audacity to tell me \"You know tip isn't included in the bill right?\" GIRL WHAT PLANET DO YOU THINK I COME FROM? If anything yo dumbass should take the hint.

Now I can be a very generous tipper but a tip is by no means mandatory especially when you put no effort into your job. If you go above and beyond and do an exemplary job I will pay you an excellent tip. However, if you do the bare minimum and that includes speaking words to your patrons, you deserve only what your employer is paying you.

How do you expect a tip for asking me like 1 question throughout the night and walking 5 meters from the kitchen to my table? That level of service is pathetic. I could do that too and more efficiently as my legs are longer.

Let me introduce you to a mind blowing concept. As a server, you go around and ask people a few minutes after serving their food and asking if everything is alright and if they need anything and then walk around every in a while refilling waters and just making sure everyone gets what they need. Boom you all get a decent tip from all the satisfied customers. I know, it's a radical idea. I'm fairly certain the owners aren't paying you to stand around and talk to your coworker all night.

Overall, my night out with my friends was pretty good but lack of service certainly detracted from the experience. 

It seems that poor service is a common issue here according to other reviews. It probably would  be of great benefit to the business if the owners got rid of the lazy, money-grubbing, airheaded, poor excuses for waitresses who think they can get by looking pretty instead of actually doing their jobs that we got tonight. Whatever we got tonight was similar to service from a fast food restaurant except the servers had the nerve to ask for a tip.

I wouldn't mind coming back here again for the food but then again I might not come back due to the non-existent service.

Also the washrooms are scary yo. The towel dispenser is hanging sideways, there's no mirror and graffiti in it's place. I've been to cleaner gas station washrooms."}
{"text":"When I saw that the Fry opened up in Richmond Hill I was pretty eager to try it since it's a bit closer to home. Decor and ambiance was really nice, looks more modern than the Yonge/Sheppard location. We went for a weekend lunch and ordered the lunch special - boneless fried chicken with soy garlic sauce (comes with fries) and spicy rice cake. We were a table for three and I felt like what we ordered was a good portion for sharing. Both dishes we had were more on the sweet side, which I didn't really mind. I would have liked it if the soy garlic had more garlic flavour though. It wasn't busy at all during lunch, even though there was only one server for the entire restaurant at that time. Prices are a little steep in my opinion, we ordered two items and the bill almost came up to $40 including tip."}
