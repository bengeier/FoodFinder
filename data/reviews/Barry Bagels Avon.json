{"text":"Staying at the Cambria hotel and followed other yelp reviewers and came here.   So much better then Panera.  DH, said it the best bagel he has had in awhile.  I had egg and cheese and it was yummy.  Skip Panera and come here.  Plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Went to Barry Bagels for the first time in Sunday.  I can't say it was a stellar experience and I'm not inclined to return.  The service was very slow, but they are new so understandable.  When I ordered our food I requested a specific bagel type and noticed that the sandwich was being made on a plain bagel.  When I asked I was told \"we are out of those so it doesn't matter.\"  So that means we don't get a choice of the 16 others you DO have?  When asked what soup we wanted we were told \"oh we are out of that too we just didn't change the sign\".  Ok I'm flexible.  So we got Motza ball which apparently they were also out of because what we did get was the remnant of a Motza ball and chicken noodle.  So we ended up with he wrong sandwich made on whatever they felt like giving, a mish mash of whatever soup was leftover (which we were up charged for) and a staff that was just not pleasant - first impressions count and this ones not good.  Sorry Barry, think I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"The bagels and bagel sandwiches are delicious! And the service was fantastic! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Vance and Jen run a first class organization!   Great food, always fresh!  I have made it part of my morning routine and miss it when I can't go!  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I visit 2-3 times per week for a bagel and cream cheese or an Eggel sandwich before work.  I've had the Lox and cream cheese, as well; it was delicious.  The bagels have an excellent texture and I love the scallion cream cheese...and the veggie ranch cream cheese...and the jalepeno cream cheese.  I love it all.  The crew is always friendly and they have a smile...even at 6:45 AM!"}
{"text":"My partner in crime ordered an amazing Bagel said it was the best he's had yet...the Creme Brûlée coffee is to die for. An amazing local spot w WiFi, and super nice attentive staff."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the bagels and coffee. I have not tried their sandwiches, soups or salads yet.

I love that they have different flavors of bagels. I have tried the Everything, Spinach & Feta and Parmesan. I think the bagels are a tad on the smaller side but the bagel was toasted perfectly and was very tasty. When I ordered the everything bagel, I got the Lite Southwest cream cheese and it had actual slices of jalapenos in it! That got my stamp of approval!

Beware of the coffee sizes. Their small cup is very small but for only .10 cents more you can get a medium. I like that they had both Hazelnut and Creme Brulee flavored coffees as well as other black coffee options.

I love that a new bagel place has opened..now just to get one to open in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"I'm not even sure how to start this review honestly. You guys know my wife is Brooklyn raised. A about 2 months back we were in Virginia and discovered bagel shop called Sclafanis. We vowed to never eat at another bagel shop unless the bagels were authentic, then we learned that Barry Bagels was opening up in Avon. 

It's about a 30 minute drive from us in parma heights, but it's a drive I'm willing to take a few times weekly. The restaurant itself is calm quiet. They have a pretty big dining area, even separate from the dining area appears to be a business dining area. 1 TV in the main area and one in the business area. The place is very clean. You can can even watch the bagels being made if there are some being made,  a-la Krispy Kreme they have a viewing area with a large sheet of glass that looks into the kitchen.  The employees are attentive and energetic. Prices don't seem too high for the quality of bagel. But enough of that. 

The bagels themselves? Amazing. I picked a lox on an everything bagel, the safe choice. It was excellent. The bagel was fresh. Well cooked on the outside and filling on the inside without being dry. They have about 7 different flavors of creme cheese,  but I stuck with classic flavor. Up until Sclafanis I hadn't had an authentic NY bagel,  then I felt that I could no longer survive without the authenticity. Then Barry Bagels opened and they taste just as Sclafanis does. I have to say if you're a bagel lover YOU MUST HAVE BARRY BAGELS, you won't regret it.

(Update: 9-19-16) Purchased a half dozen bagels to bring back home for the weekend. 2 everything, a vanilla cinnamon, cinnamon raisin, sesame bagel and an asiago bagel. The employee who bagged my bagels had quite a bit of knowledge. She even knew to bag the everything bagels separate from the other bagels, and even gave us a bagel bag to keep them fresh as long as possible. Speaking of staying fresh this was Saturday and this morning my asiago bagel still retained its freshness. All I can do is continue to give praise."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a dreary Cleveland afternoon for a bagel pick-me-up.  Ordered 2 cheddar jalepeno and 2 blueberry for the next day.  On the car ride home, I tried a smell test to see if I could identify the two types, as I asked them to be put them in separate bags (which they were not going to do unless I asked).  Bad news, I honestly could not smell a difference between the two - nothing.  In fact, neither had much of an aroma.

When I got home shortly then after, I toasted the cheddar jalepeno and slapped on a little Philly cream cheese.  My overall thoughts - fair, at best.  The bagels are on the smaller side. The bagel really had no flavor and there were no identifing qualities of cheddar cheese or the spice of jalepeno's.  Overall a very disappointing effort.  I smelled the blueberry up close and can say that I would expect the same - there are no qualities noted that this will be a tasty bagel.

Overall, there is nothing there to ever have me go back - not impressed, at all.

Also noted plain cream cheese is $7.00/lb (which is 2 bricks of the inexpensive $2/brick Philly cream cheese) and flavored is $8.00/lb.  Comment - that is ridiculous!

Wanted to see first hand about the blueberry bagel so I cut it in half to toast it.  I counted only 3 blueberries in the entire bagel.  Did it have any taste?  Nope.

This place is a major pass ... in fact, given this complete lack of quality, I'm willing to go out on a limb and say this place will not be around for long."}
{"text":"Ok so Barry Bagels . . . Really good bagels, lousy coffee. Hubby and I came for breakfast at 9:45am today, Saturday. We were greeted and our orders were taken. The bagel selection is excellent. The bagels are REALLY good. The cream cheese is good. Now to the coffee. I am not a coffee connoisseur but my husband is. I think it was awful. He agreed. We both got a small which was ridiculously small for the price. Tiniest cup I've ever seen in fact for a coffee cup. Most of the coffee pumps were empty except for the one we used. The guest before us waited at least 10 min for them to be refilled and her order was to go so she waited A LONG TIME! It's now 30+ min since we arrived and 2 coffee pumps still aren't refilled. Plus, they charge for refills! Not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great bagels and really enjoyed the farmers bagel sandwich.  Sandwich made with a fresh egg mixed with fresh veggies along with a choice of meat and cheese.  

Kids enjoyed the vanilla cinnamon bagels and the spinach feta."}
{"text":"Just visited this bagel place for the first time today. I'm very impressed with it it was very good I like the staff they were laid-back and friendly. I got the everything bagel with the light veggies ranch cream cheese and I also got the vanilla cinnamon bagel with honey brown sugar cream cheese. They were both really good you could tell that the bagels were fresh the cream cheese were good. For both I think I paid $5 and change which isn't bad."}
{"text":"9/10!! Ventured there on a Saturday early, to make sure I got the freshest of bagels. As I drove their I hoped and prayed they would be New York style bagels, as I've been searching desperately throughout Cleveland to find one. Low and behold, I found it! Barry's looks like your typical bagel shop, similar to Einstein or brueggers, but it's so much more. 

Appearance: it was spot clean, no messy fingerprints on the glass, the inside is nice and dark, dim lighting perfect atmosphere. There's a window for you to watch them bake the bagels, it's quite fun to see actually. 

Service: the girls behind the counter were super duper nice and friendly. They were quick! 

Order: we got an everything bagel with cream cheese and lox, and another everything bagel with cream cheese. Checkout was a breeze, we got to the car and one of the girls behind the counter chased us down, seems they forgot to put lox on one of the bagels, she was super apologetic and offered to bring us out another fresh bagel with lox! Score we got a free bagel! 

Aftermath: WELP, afterwards I said to myself \"I f**ked up\" because the bagel was everything I needed it to be. The outside was crunchy and the inside was so soft and perfect, the bagel was the perfect thickness, the perfect size. Biting into it was like walking down West 42nd in NYC and realizing I'm in heaven! It had the perfect amount of everything flavor and the cream cheese was just enough to make it perfect, usually places either glob on too much or barely put any on.

Final thoughts: BARRYS IS A WIN! For me it's a drive, but totally worth it! Price was perfect, taste was amazing, service was outstanding, I'm happy I ventured out here cause now I know what is my #1 bagel spot! Go BARRYS!!!"}
{"text":"Barry's bagel is the best bagel around! The bachelors are made fresh in house, the perfect size,  chewy crust, and flavors! The staff is super friendly and they serve doggy bagels for your furry family! Don't leave without the scallion cream cheese!!! It is freshly mixed and you can buy it by the pound, it is not prepackaged!"}
{"text":"So this review is just on their product. They are brand new and are still working out some things with their staff/training and operation so I am going to give them a chance to settle in before addressing that. Their bagels are excellent with great variety and the choice of cream cheese is awesome. Everything I have had here has been very fresh and tasty. We were so excited that they opened because Avon has NOTHING but chain restaurants as far as the eye can see. It's like the city has banned local bakery's or breakfast places-and it's not like Barry's is independent or local (again, I think the city must have something in their ordinances against that), but at least now we have some other option than Bob Evans or Perkins :( Their coffee situation is very limited, but we get our bagels to go and enjoy them at home on our patio with our own coffee. Often times when we get home they are still warm. Yum!"}
{"text":"I was Happy to see a new Bagel place in Avon, but really disappointed. Been there twice and orders not ready or completely right each time. Ordered breakfast bagel with egg, cheese and bacon. Only bacon on one half of it. Blueberry bagel Barely have any blueberries in it, to the dismay of my little one."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a \"real\" bagel option in the area, as Panera's bagels are really just bagel-shaped bread. Their bagels and Eggels (their cute name for breakfast sandwiches) have all been very good. Bagels are always fresh, as are the vegetables they use on their sandwiches.

Juice options are limited, unfortunately, to Minute Maid concentrated. They could use a re-eval on that front.

One sort of annoying this is that, each of the half dozen or times we've visited, service is among the absolute slowest of anyplace I've ever eaten, ever. While the kids who work there are nice, it takes forever if there are 2 or 3 in front of you in line. I'm not sure what the hold-ups are, but we've never been there when things have gone quickly.

The biggest negative, though, is that they have Fox News on in their dining room in the mornings, which at this point, isn't defensible in any way."}
{"text":"We came in for our first visit and I got an everything bagel with regular cream cheese who was very fresh a delicious. My wife got a vanilla cinnamon bagel with some kind of honey brown sugar cream cheese which was also very fresh and even better than mine!  We ordered 6 to go and will be having them tomorrow for breakfast with the kids. We will definitely be back for more next time we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Did not have the best experience. I've heard great things about this place and have been wanting to check it out for a while. I stopped in today to get two bagels and two coffees. The guy that took my order couldn't look more like he'd rather be anywhere in the world but there. A lady came in behind me who must've been a regular because the staff knew her by name. They immediately started her order and put mine on hold. My husband and baby were waiting in the car so I was a little annoyed about this. When I checked out I asked for two small coffees. The cashier slammed the cups down and said it's over there and pointed towards the coffee. The creme brûlée coffee was completely out. I told one of the workers and he said, \"ok.\" And walked away? So I chose a different coffee and then the half and half was out which again same guy responded, \"ok\" and continued doing what he was doing? At least let me know if you're going to re-fill it or say just a minute? The bagels were just ok, both had hardly any cream cheese on them. Maybe I just went on the wrong day, but won't be rushing to go back."}
{"text":"Cute bagel shop, good location. 

Menu could be better organized, slightly confusing when walking in. 

Had to wait a few minutes as they can only heat 2 sammy's up at a time. 

Gets pretty busy on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"A lot of beeping from industrial style microwaves and no sort of coffee selection.  I watched someone pour powder into water and stir it in front of me for the hot chocolate I ordered...could have done that at home.

Fine food, not something I'm dying to go back to."}
{"text":"I came into town on business and went to Barry Bagels Avon location on the basis of previous Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. My bagel was everything a bagel should be... chewy and tasty.

I ordered an onion bagel with lox, cream cheese, red onions and capers. The best way to describe the taste is heavenly happiness. I noticed they have matzo ball soup and may come back tomorrow to try it out."}
{"text":"Great bagels!!! My breakfast sandwich was generous and so satisfying!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Bagels in town! Great staff! Buy a dozen and freeze best price! Onion, Everything and Blueberry a must!"}
{"text":"Great place clean. Everybody is very polite and friendly great location easy access off of I-90. Definitely have to visit and experience."}
{"text":"I finally tried Barry Bagels out of necessity and curiosity, as my local Bruegger's joint here in North Olmsted suddenly and unexpectedly (I hate when they do that) closed overnight, and I was having withdrawal symptoms!  I'm a huge bagel maven with carb cravings (yo yo YO!), so I drove a bit out of my way to try this place, having only heard about it a few days before.  I've been patronizing both Einstein's and Bruegger's over the decades, so I just had to try BB to compare.  All in all, I really like BB, and their authentic New York style bagels taste excellent.  The spinach-feta bagel is great, and i've always been a fan of asiago bagels (although I wish BB would melt some asiago cheese on top of the bagel, like Einstein's and Bruegger's do).  The coffee and sides were good too.  I am hoping that BB scouts a new location here in North Olmsted, as there is now a glaring empty black hole in town where a bagel oasis once was!"}
{"text":"I was really happy with Barry Bagels. I have been twice so far. The first time, it was with the family. I tried the turkey bagel sandwich on a plain bagel just to get an idea of how they were. The serving of turkey was generous. The taste was good. It was near closing, but it didn't seem stale. 

The kids tried cookies which were a huge hit. They were so soft! 

The other time I was there was for a bunch (I had a coupon for 16 for the price of 12.) I was happy with the selection, and glad they separated the different types of bagels. Cinnamon next to jalapeño would be gross. The bagels were a big hit, as were the two cream cheeses I got but did not sample. 

I would like to try their coffee soon, but everything else seems to be just fine. I will be back often."}
{"text":"We waited for a long time for Barry Bagels to open, they have tasty bagels and egg bagel sandwiches, BUT service is slow, we were overcharged, and the coffee sits in a small area in a carafe which is very difficult to dispense, and gets congested - not to mention coffee runs out.  We've decided to not go back, paying $2 for a cup of coffee that isn't made for you (like at at Starbucks) but you have to PUMP out of a carafe (awkward and difficult) and sometimes the type of coffee you want isn't available; then want to charge you 50 cents for a refill on such coffee out of a carafe - um I think NOT!  Way too many other choices for a bagel, Einstein Bros, Panera, Brueggers.... all very good, they don't overcharge for coffee, and guess what you can get a refill for FREE - oh and freshly brewed, not sitting in a carafe that is almost impossible to pump out!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this shop to open since I first saw the sign pop up as we live in a bagel desert!

The layout is much larger than expected. Lots of tables and nooks to sit in. Would be a nice place for a date or to catch up on some work quietly (Need to check and see if they have wifi next time), or have a small meeting. Also have several decent sized TVs.

They have a loyalty rewards program you can sign up for - buy 12 bagels and get one free. The cashier did not mention it to me and I was disappointed when I saw a sign after checking out as I purchased 6 bagels on my visit. Manager heard me and came up and reopened my order so I could get a card and get credit for my purchase - what great customer service!

They offer bagels, sandwiches, soups, salads and have Biggby coffee (First time I have seen it offered locally.) Bagels were a decent price and the selection was still great when we stopped in on a Saturday evening. We tried the everything, asiago cheese, garlic and sunny grain. They were fresh and had a nice chew and texture. Looking forward to trying some sweet bagels on next visit."}
{"text":"This place has gone way down hill...

If the manger/owner is not working it's a total joke.

They can't make more than one sandwich at a time... which takes forever.

They are now charging for coffee refills!!! Funny Panara and Dunkin don't do that... what gives Barry???"}
{"text":"My family's absolute favorite place to eat or bring home for any meal! Clean, affordable, friendly staff, delicious. We love this location. As a native of Toledo I missed Barry Bagels. I actually prefer this location to any other Barry's I've been to. We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Very very good breakfast bagels!  We got bacon egg cheddar tomato on Sunnyside bagels!"}
