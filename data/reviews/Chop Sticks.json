{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars because it's Chinese food that is what it is. They don't make any gourmet promises.

This place is great though for take-out or delivery. The people that work there are so nice. There for awhile, my fiancee and I were so busy that we'd order delivery from them a couple times a week. We usually get the same thing and they'd say over the phone \"You live at (our address) right?\" It was awesome, they dropped off our food and were always really gracious to us. We moved to another neighborhood and after a few months ordered delivery from them again and they remembered us still. The delivery guy even asked us how we were liking our new neighborhood.

The food isn't like wow gourmet Chinese amazing, but it's pretty good. The beef and broccoli is very good, the beef lo mein is really good, and the beef and snow peas is really good too- always crispy vegetables. The crab rangoon is also good and it's the best sweet and sour chicken I've had in town.  

Delivery is generally pretty fast and the prices are dirt cheap."}
{"text":"Pretty much the same as any Chinese take-out place with slightly nicer tables. Was very cold but they put a space heater blowing at our table (as we were literally the only people at the restaurant at noon on a Sunday)."}
{"text":"Good Chinese delivery.  Nothing to die for, but solid food at good prices.  I've had the cold sesame noodles, which were good, though not spicy at all.  The hot and sour soup has nice tofu in it, but could be hotter and sourer.  Pork fried rice is good, though the rice is kind of a strange yellow-orange color.  This will probably be my go-to Chinese delivery in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"I've order General Tso's chicken and disappointed. It wasn't sweet, tangy, or red enough and the sauce was too watery."}
