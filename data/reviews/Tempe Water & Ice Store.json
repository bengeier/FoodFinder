{"text":"New ownership only cares about his iPod/iPad screen fixing business. On multiple occasions we have walked in and stood around waiting to be helped, only to see the man that works there, working feverishly on an iPad in the back. Never looking up or acknowledging that we are there-even with his alarm that alerts him when a customer has walked into the store. The last visit we made (and will ever make) we stood for close to 5 min and even walked up the the doorway that goes to the back, only to be ignored. So we left and will drive out of our way to go to a different store. Previous owners were amazing and very helpful. Now, they don't acknowledge you at all, and would rather you walk out, than actually help you. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in last two weeks and both times the people were friendly and helpful.  Bonus, their ice cream freezer is chock-full of every flavor you could think of, dozens of them!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was a great experience for me. I got the bottles that I needed (after my old ones finally died), a free fill of water for them, and a nice chat with the sales guy. When I need new bottles or an emergency water refill, I'm coming here."}
{"text":"The young man offered to clean my bottles and fill them.  He asked if was my first time here and then gave me my two gallons of water for no charge.  Very kind of him.
I asked questions about the glass bottles cuz I thought that was interesting.  They had 1, 3, and 5 gallon sizes, the larger of the two I believe he told me were made in Italy and the smallest one was actually made in America (gasp!).  Okay, THAT impressed me because so much of the stuff sold in the USA is  from China. 
And of course they have those water bottle stands, ceramic bases, plastic bottles, and THRIFTY ICE CREAM.  Woohoo!  
Well no i scream today, but who knows about later this week?!
Anyway, the young man working filled the brown, glass bottles after he pressure washed the insides and encouraged us to come back soon.
I guess we'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this particular store. We've been coming here for over two years now for our water and the support that is given each time is great. I have also used the iphone repair services and the pricing is excellent and I was in and out within about 15 minutes and my phone was like new. Very happy with my experience here. 

For the record, I see a negative review on here and I'm surprised by it. The gentleman who works there busts his butt and is only concerned with the customer. We have been there for water or other services over two dozen times and never had an experience that wasn't great."}
