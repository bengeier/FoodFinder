{"text":"Good food!  We had the superhero subs.  No wait and friendly staff who checked in on us to make sure we were satisfied.   Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Website says delivery hours are till 8:45pm. Called and was told no at 8:30... Please correct website hours or stop trying to shut down early."}
{"text":"A lil $$ but it seemes all subs shops are getting there."}
{"text":"Been looking for a great, quick and cheap (read: Cheaper than a traditional restaurant sandwich) and they've nailed it. I've only had the veggie sandwiches here and they're great. Brought a couple home to my wife and kids (who are vegetarian) and they loved them as well. Good stuff."}
{"text":"So a friend of mine ate there a few times and said it was good. I was at work today and ordered food for me and 2 others. We got to pastrami sandwhiches and mine sis not have enough meat on it for 8 bucks  and my friends was burnt. My other friend got a side if meatballs. One thing they did too was deliver it somewhat still warm. Anyway it was just ok and if you want you should still try it out. I just did not care for it."}
{"text":"Love this place but they have to change the name of their sub called the experience. Do you know how awkward it is to call in and order the footlong experience."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Planet Sub.  This little sub shop stays true to its roots from the University of Kansas.  The bread is amazing.

My favorite is the classic Planet sub.  I'm never disappointed.  My wife is a fan of the Creamy Club (Turkey, Cream Cheese, veggies, sprouts) and the Green Turkey (Turkey, Guac, Veggies).  Co workers love the chicken subs, but I've never tried them.  I collect the large Planet Sub cups for use in the office and at home.  It is a 25 minute drive that I make 2-3 times a month and it is definetly worth it.  Large Sub and Large Drink is around $10, but it costs about the same as my order at Chipotle or Five Guys.

Favorite Sub shop in the Valley."}
{"text":"yum yum yum! this sub place does a great job. we can get many subs for a good price. I enjoy the dip sub and having it delivered in usually under 30 minutes. They do a great job !"}
{"text":"Needed a quick lunch on my break from work so went here since it was close by and I've never been here. I got a half buffalo chicken with ranch.. I open it and the sauces were globbed on way too much that it was all over the inside of the foil and a huge mess and making the bread soggy. Already at work and starving, had to eat through it plus it was so messy and they gave me one thin napkin. Most likely won't go back"}
{"text":"Never going here again, although the service was fast the quality of chicken was disgusting. Every bite was crunchy like cartilage and had way to much spice on it. My friend also found a hair in her sandwich (she pulled it out of her mouth)."}
{"text":"I got the Philly cheese steak and the steak was very dry. They burnt the bread very bad close to not edible. I got  my daughter the grilled cheese off the kids menu and it was cooked the same way. She did eat the entire thing though it was mostly bread with a very sad portion of cheese. 

I would put the quality on par with Sheetz  if not a little lower."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since this business has opened, and every time I've found new menu items that I've fallen in love with. 

Despite being flanked by impressive competitors (BurgerFi on the left, Chipotle on the right), Planet Sub manages to draw my appetite the majority of the time. They have a very wide variety of subs, from beef, chicken, seafood and vegetarian, as well as a beer menu. Additionally they have soup, salad and wrap options.

The food has always been above-average, and if you can't decide on a single one to get I'd recommend the Beefeater. The staff is friendly and service prompt. If your sub is toasted (as is standard) the wait time can seem to drag, especially if they are busy, but it's worth it for the quality of food... all of which is fresh and made daily (as is the case for the bread).

Sidenote: their footlong subs are formidable in size. Don't be surprised to find yourself saving half for later. And as a friendly FYI, if you do I found that reheating the subs in the oven at 350F for 15 minutes works just fine."}
{"text":"My staff and I visit Planet Sub every Tuesday for Turkey Tuesday. $2.50 Turkey subs. Great bread being made in the restaurant. Mom and daughter owned restaurant. Very friendly. You have to tell them if you want you sub cold or it will come hot to you. They make the sub in the back of the kitchen so its not like subway, port of subs, etc.... The meat is not processed tasting and the bread is not frozen and then baked. It's fresh and baked same day. FANTASTIC!!! 

They deliver the subs to you. Affordable, nice environment and fast for someone who has one hour for lunch. 

They also have a punch card. Wednesday is double punch day."}
{"text":"Always fresh and good quality food. Always at the top of out list. It is a little pricier however it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop, especially if you are in a hurry. Orders are ready fast and they have tons of different selections to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. Fresh bread and fresh toppings, hard to beat that in a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"The subs are fantastic, some of the best i've ever had, but their hours are terrible. Why would you close at 4pm. I don't know how many times I would have gone here but, whoops, no. They close at a ridiculous time when people who are getting off work would like to eat. In the future I'll go to the one 10 minutes away that closes at 9."}
{"text":"This place has excellent subs and great customer service!  Kudos for having lots of veggie offerings."}
{"text":"Ridiculous ...... Everything in a small pile in the middle of the bun. Had to rebuild the entire sandwich, scrape off the piles of rancid mayo and even then it was virtually inedible. Too bad as all the other Portage Crossing food places are quite good. Guess it won't be long until they are gone and hopefully something good moves in."}
{"text":"This is my review from last week! 
-I had my first bad experience at planet sub today :( I love psub! I've been going there multiple times a week for lunch because it's close to my work and always delicious. Well today when I came in there was only one other person in there eating so it obviously wasn't busy. I ordered my sandwich and sat down as usual. When it came out it was chicken instead of turkey, ham, and roast beef like I was expecting. I took 2 bites and decided I didn't wanna pay for a sandwich that I never intended on ordering. I went up front to the guy that rang me up and he said he would have it fixed right away. He was great! He rang it in correctly but the ticket was misread. When the sandwich came back it had the correct meat but it didn't have the lettuce, tomato, and onion I had added to the sandwich to begin with and the meat was only on half the bread and the other half of the bread was falling apart because of too much BBQ sauce. As I said before, I go there all the time and I always have an amazing lunch but today I was really disappointed. The sandwich I ended up with was soggy and poorly constructed. Maybe I'm just hangry and writing this review will help me feel better.


-Well today I went into planet sub and they totally made up for it! They recognized me right away and gave me a gift card and were very sweet and apologetic. I got back to work and my sandwich was made perfectly and service was great as usual. Thank you psub!"}
{"text":"We were in downtown Chandler and looking for somewhere to eat.  We've passed the place a couple times before driving, so we decided to check it out today.  The smell of fresh bread when you walk in is amazing, so that was definitely a great first impression.

I had the 12\" Super Hero and I thought it was great.  The bread was fresh and the meats and cheese in the sandwich were just the right amount.

My wife had the Green Turkey.  She was very happy that they had sprouts available to put on sandwiches and liked that their bread was whole wheat.

The kids just had basic ham and american and turkey and american sandwiches from the kids menu.  They weren't anything special, but they enjoyed them and finished their food.  That's all I can ask for.

We're not often in the mood for sandwiches, but when we are this is definitely a place we'll go to again especially if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options. Only one choice of bread, but it is freshly made and was fine."}
{"text":"I have to give it 5 stars.  I went to grad school at KU and lived at the original Planet Sub in Lawrence, KS.  It was called Yello Sub in Lawrence.  The fresh baked bread is what makes these subs.  They have a very diverse menu with lot's of vegetarian options.  My favorites are the Creamy Club and the Californian.  So glad to have \"Yello Sub\" (here it is called Planet Sub) back in my life."}
{"text":"Nice Surprise!  Stopped by there today just looking for a new place to try and wow they make a darn good sub!  Bread is tinder and the fixins were just right.  I had a sub they recommended, Dagwood's Dream... Ummmmmm super tasty!  Besides the food the place is very nice inside, nice decor and very clean.  I would recommend checking it out!  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Best sub place ever!  I started eating these subs back in Lawrence KS where they originated from and was so excited when they decided to move to AZ!  

Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"I avoided this place for the longest time because I thought it would be \"another sub shop\" but I was wrong!"}
{"text":"Only came because i had a coupon. All 3 subs came out cheesy. REAL CHEESY. I had a veggie sub that was 90%  cheese.  Wont be back......"}
{"text":"Excellent subs, my new go to place since it's walking distance from work, and the people there are very nice and friendly...I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place would be my guilty pleasure, but there's nothing to be guilty about here folks. I just order delivery here too damn much. Small house salad and a planet sub always hits the spot. Feeling lazy? Want a sub delivered that's much better in quality than jimmy johns? Give this place your money. The Yelp app to order your food is pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"We started coming here for work as an option other than Port of Subs.  The staff is very friendly and it feels like a family run business.  I have tried the italian (delicious), the pastrami (delicious) and the philly cheese steak (delicious) but my favorite is the grilled chicken.  Seriously I think it is all due to the baked fresh and toasted bread.  The dining area is small so if you come when the Intel hoard is there expect to wait.  Make sure to get a stamp card and take advantage of Double Stamp Wednesdays!!  This is my new favority sub shop."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch the other day. Nothing special about the place. The food was good but a little over priced, especially considering all the sub shops in the area. I found it weird that while waiting in line you get to watch a guy pound dough before ordering. After ordering they don't give you a number, rather you get a card from a playing deck of cards - this is the what they call when they bring your food out. If this is supposed to be a cool gimmick then they to missed the mark. What is wrong with just giving me a regular number?  Also, the subs are made in the back where you can't see (I found this a little weird- but that's just me). They also didn't seem to have enough people working in the back because it took a fairly long time to get our food compared to the other sub shops in the area. However, in their defense they could still be working out the \"kinks\" since they just opened up. I'll wait a little it and give them another chance."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and really nice customer service. Food was delicious too. I will definitely be coming back to enjoy more subs:)"}
{"text":"Solid sub sandwich joint. Much better than the typical offerings in the category. The staff is friendly, prices are reasonable, and delivery is quick."}
{"text":"I didn't bring lunch to work and I didn't have my car, so I ordered Planet Sub on a whim. I got the Tempeh Parmesan Sub and pasta salad...because I didn't know just how HUGE the sub was going to be; perfectly toasted and loaded with ingredients! 

The pasta salad was alright...the noodles were a bit overcooked and mushy, but the flavor was there.

Another plus...I placed my order through GrubHub and received my food within 8 minutes. Impressive.

I'm going to have to introduce this place to my boyfriend!"}
{"text":"Honestly in love with this place. I wish I could comment on their other menu items but I only get The Experience. Bread is phenomenal, you can tell its fresh. 

Only downside is that's the quality seems to dip a bit on weekends. I've had a few samiches come out a little soggy, poorly assembled. Overall though, great!"}
{"text":"The scene: It's the day before my wedding, and there are people and flowers EVERYWHERE.  No room, no food, no time.  With about 45 minutes until our mani/pedi appointments, the GrubHub app came out and we picked a random sandwich shop.  My helpful father picked up a variety of salads and sandwiches, brought them back, and we devoured them en route to the salon.  

I had a chicken Caesar salad with tender grilled chicken, banana peppers, bacon, parmesan, hold the onions please.  The dressing to salad ratio was perfect, which is a big deal to me.  The best part was the little roll of bread that came with the salad.  I figured with a side roll that good, the sandwiches had to be pretty good.

I was right.  On our first dine-in experience I tried the veggie sub and was not disappointed.  I usually dislike subs for two reasons: boring deli meats and plain, tough bread that cuts my mouth when I bite in.  These sandwiches fit neither!  The ingredients are fresh, flavorful and in delicious combinations. The bread is soft, doesn't overwhelm the sandwich, baked in the shop each morning.  I'm impressed.

The service is top notch.  Someone has said hello or goodbye every time we walk in, with a genuine \"thanks for stopping by!\""}
{"text":"Great customer service. I got mega roast beef sandwich. It looks and taste good. I would buy that again. So much selection. I have to go back to taste every one of them lol. I would come back for another sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  The subs are all delicious.  The service is fast and friendly.  You can call ahead and pick up or order in store.  

The restaurant is clean and the seating area is nice with a couple TVs in it.

Definitely a good place for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday (Sunday) and the hostess was very friendly and knew the menu without referring to it. A smile went a long way and the bread on my Planet Sub sandwich was SO fresh. The soda machine is the new Coca Cola kind that dispenses every Coke flavor known to man. So, I recommend! Thanks hostess!"}
{"text":"The subs here are GOOD! 
This was my first time dining at Plant Sub. When you walk in the menu is a little overwhelming. There are so many choices! I recommend checking out the menu before going. 
I decided on the Green Turkey (turkey, bacon, guac, salsa, cream cheese, onions, sprouts and tomatoes). I asked to have it on wheat bread and the staff told me all of their bread is whole wheat...nice! 
They handed me the Queen of Hearts playing card (fitting I know) and that's how they found me when delivering my sandwich to the table. 
All subs here are served hot unless you ask for it cold. I normally don't like hot subs but these are ridiculous. The bread is what really makes this place stand out. The fillings are delish too, but really...it's all about the warm fresh bread. My goddaughter (very picky eater) inhaled her sandwich and said she never wanted to go to Subway again, that this is her favorite sandwich. 
Seating gets a little tight during the lunch hour.
A few tips... 
Tuesday = $2.50 any Turkey sandwich 
Thursday = $3.00 any Veggie sandwich 
They also have a stamp card to earn a free sub. 

Go get some lunch!"}
{"text":"First time here, I really enjoyed The Experience Sub and my daughter like the Veg Grinder. Good level of spice, large plump chicken chunks and toasty bun. The service was very good and I learned they will be delivering to more areas in the future. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The subs are awesome and the delivery is quick. I have order from them a few times and have great experiences. They toasted subs are fantastic and the salads are good too but a little small for the price. Over all a great place and I will be ordering again."}
{"text":"With there fresh baked wheat bread and all there fresh toppings all toasted together, what sub place could be better!??They have there famous Turkey Tuesday and Veggie Thursdays. So yummy! I'm there at least 1-2 times a week!!! My family and I love them. They just added home made fresh Bread bowls for there soup! There service and customer service is great!!! A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"After calling and speaking with the manager he took care of us. Steve went above and beyond what many managers would have done. He is very pleasant and cares about the shop."}
{"text":"I love my sub shops so I was excited to hear of a new place to the neighborhood. The sandwiches on the menu sound amazing. I just wish there was more care put into the making of the sandwich and being more timely. I feel like there could be potential. The wait is long and the sandwich toppings are piled right in the middle and not evenly distributed. I also ordered mine without tomatoes which the tomatoes were put on it. I know mistakes can be made but I went back about 2 weeks later to try again and had the exact same problems. It's too much to pay for a sandwich when care is not taken in preparing it. A huge disappointment. Looks like I'll be sticking with my Jimmy Johns and Penn Station."}
{"text":"I just flew into town & was pretty hungry. From my hotel room I was looking for a spot nearby that delivers & has good food...which is how I found Planet Sub. I ordered the Chicken Parm sub & I must say it was delicious. The bread was nicely toasted, and the Chicken Parm in the middle with cheese was perfect. If I lived here I would come here more often. Too bad there isn't a location in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"The sandwich was pretty good and the guy at the counter was genuinely interested in my experience.  With that kind of attentiveness, you can expect a good experience."}
{"text":"We come here a lot and we love the service and the food! The sandwiches are great and we love the bread the subs are on! Overall this place is downright amazing and we will keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Thursday and there was no one at the front counter when I walked in.  After a short wait to have my order taken the sub was ready very fast.  As for the quality I would put the food slightly better than subway.  The atmosphere is very \"chipotle\" too which isn't an insult, it just has that same feel."}
{"text":"So good.
I got the green turkey sub.
Blows Subway & Jimmie Johns out of the water.
AND THEY DELIVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"I purchase a sub to take home for dinner. I was surprised to see no other customers inside. The restaurant next door was packed. I took a bite of the sub and a long brown hair was in it. I immediately called the on duty manager and she told me she would call me back. After about ten minutes she called and I told her not only did I find a hair but the bread was soggy from the wet lettuce. She asked if I wanted another one delivered since she was the one who made it. I stated to her that I lived 7 miles away and really didn't want another sub after that. She told me I could come in and get another sub or get my money back. She apologized and was nice. A week later I went in hoping to see the African American manager that was aware of the situation. Another gal was working and had an attitude. I explained to her what went down. I could tell by her tone she didn't want to make or give me a sub. She was like why didn't you have the issue solved that night. I'm thinking you got to be kidding me. She started to walk back in the kitchen and I asked her are you going to ask what type of sub I want. She turned around and rolled her eyes. At this point I'm starting to get irritated. An older blonde lady walks out and says to me I'm the owner. I was thinking great finally I'll get some good customer service WRONG! She was trying to defend the gal with the bad attitude. I explained the situation for the third time. Told the owner about the hair and crappy sub. She kept interrupting me, and I told her I didn't want the sub. She was not empathetic at all. She was like we try to handle the situation the same day rudely. I have now heard this from three people. How hard is it to understand that once you find a hair in food you don't want to eat anything from there immediately after. I certainly didn't feel like driving back there after working all day. She didn't care that I wasted my hard earned money on a soggy sub with a hair in it. They had an opportunity to turn a negative into a positive for me. Have you ever heard the customer is always right. You won't stay in business treating people bad with soggy subs. Get a clue!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had a better review for Planet Subs then I do. The staff was so sweet, friendly and courteous. I could have just hugged the lady behind the counter, she was so warm and inviting. However, I was not impressed with the food.

My husand and I both shared sandwiches so we can sample what our favorites usually are at sandwich shops. We had the Super Hero(italian sub) and the Tuna. The Super Hero really lacked taste and I couldn't differentiate between the different flavored meats. The sandwich was very boring and lacked flavor.

The Tuna was simply horrible. I grew up in New York and I might have high expectations, but I expect Tuna salad to have a thicker consistency and not have a brown coloring to it. The Tuna was very thin in consistency and tasted like poor quality tuna.

Again, I wish I had a better review because the staff was so sweet and we need more businesses with such a friendly affect - but the food just didn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"I frequent here because it's in my work complex. Always fast and always great! I recommend \"the experience\" sandwich. It has chicken, bacon, pepperoni, jalapeño, chipotle sauce, and cream cheese!"}
{"text":"On Tuesday 6/26/18 myself and my three young children had lunch at Planet Sub, not only was the food delicious and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, but they turned a bummer of a situation into the best case scenario for me. After we finished our lunch I walked my children to the car and somehow i managed to lock us out of the car while my keys and phone were inside. I went back into the restaurant and everyone was so helpful. Employees let me barrow their personal cell phones to google and contact roadside assistance. They never once seemed irritated that we were occupying a table (the lunch rush was thinning), and as soon as the restaurant was empty of other patrons they quickly turned the tv to cartoons for my children. All in all we waited for nearly two hours and the whole time the employees were kind and helpful. We have always loved the food at Planet Sub but now I have a whole new respect for our local sub restaurant."}
{"text":"Do your self a favor and DON'T ever come in or order for this place. The woman working can't understand that people who are paying customers need to use the bathroom. Me and my husband went to use the bathroom after lunch (which my sub  made wrong and she refused to fix it) and we both had to go poop. After we came out of being in the bathroom for 5 mins she scolded us on how it needs to one at a time because other customers were waiting. Well #1 we were the ONLY  customers in the restaurant and #2 it's actually quicker to have BOTH of us go in at the same time. And by the way the bathroom was dirty. I had to clean poop off the seat because she was to lazy being on the phone with a friend."}
{"text":"I have never been to a sub shop that offered gluten-free bread and vegetarian options! Woohoo for Planet Sub!!  I got a vegetarian grinder on gluten-free bread. I've actually never had a sub sandwich, so I don't know how they're supposed to taste, but this was delicious. Plenty of ingredients, not too much bread (which was good when toasted.) Yes, the bread was a bit dry. I had to dip it in marinara, but it's gluten free bread, what more can you expect? It had a nice taste, not baking-soda-y like some other breads I've had. 

 If you join their email club you get a free sandwich on your birthday. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for lunch the other day and while I realllly liked my sandwich, he thought his was just \"okay\".  I ordered an untoasted 6\" turkey club and added mustard instead of mayo and a side of potato salad.  He ordered a footlong buffalo chicken sandwich. I *think* the reason he thought his sandwich was just \"ok\" is because the buffalo sauce isn't very spicy. I personally thought it was delicious. I wanted to try his sandwich to see what it tasted like, and I liked it better than he did! The turkey on my sandwich was fresh sliced off a deli slicer and they didn't skimp on the bacon whatsoever. The bread was really tasty too.  On his, the quality of the chicken was super good and to ME the buffalo sauce/flavoring on the sandwich was great. The potato salad was decent too. I'm unsure if there are special deals per days/etc but if not- I'd totally come in at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Whole NEW Sub experience! First time here...We had 'The Experience' and 'Dagwood' subs! Amazing flavor and not a ton of bread. Whole Wheat bread baked daily! I mentioned was our first time; she stated all bread is toasted unless you wish otherwise. I can't eat at subway as the bread makes me sick. Gluten free options are available. Unlimited drink refills at machine. Download their app and receive $2 off first order. Plus electronic PSub's Loyalty Club between the cash registers; sign in (with your ph #) to get points/free sides, etc. Will return!"}
{"text":"A sandwich isn't tough to make so that's why I'm confused on how they messed it all up. I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich. The bread was the best part about it. The lettuce was not fresh but wilted with only two tomato slices. They put too much mayonnaise on it so disgusting! I threw it away and will not be back."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sandwich place in Chandler. The fresh baked wheat bread is mouthwatering. My coworkers and I make Planet Sub our lunch stop at least once a week. The creamy club is definitely my favorite. They have a lot of different sandwiches to choose from and you can turn any sandwich into a wrap. The other sandwich places in the same vicinity don't have anything on Planet Sub. My only request is that they would open more locations in the valley. This location is very easy to find and the service has always been superb."}
{"text":"Ordered a classic turkey sub. The sandwich was mostly toasted bread and very little of anything else. The sandwich looked \"empty\" when I took it out if the wrapper.  I had to really look for the contents of the sandwich. 

I like trying new places but I really didn't feel any value eating here.

On the positive side,  the place was clean and employee at the counter was pleasant."}
{"text":"Super clean fun atmosphere much like \"Bob's Subs\" I have back home up North of Pittsburgh. Very friendly, courteous, and on point staff. The food is fairly priced edging on the side of well that's just too much for a sub... as far as presentation and quality it was very fresh. Looked great and smelled and tasted great. I ate there twice while in Ohio. Hot and fresh and was exactly what I had been looking for. Really hit the spot. The combos are a little high to add on for a simple drink and chips. Other than that I would definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"Placed a order for delivery and have to report that it took a little longer than normal but it was worth the wait. Food was great and I will be ordering again. Enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Found this great sandwich shop on yelp today and had to try it out. Definitely not your run of the mill sandwich shop. They have a great selection of wraps salads and sandwiches. Everything is made fresh to order, even the bread is made in house and so much better then Subway. I had the Planet Sub and it was excellent. All sandwiches are made hot to order unless you tell them otherwise. Here's another plus, the prices are on par with all the other sandwich shops. I paid 6.29 for a 6\" sandwich but you can pay as little as 5.49 for a basic sandwich. 
If there is one drawback it's finding the place. It's packed in a strip mall with all kinds of businesses, restaurant, you name it, but it was worth driving around for 5 minutes to find it. 
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Planet Sub is definitely a good option for solid, good tasting subs. I'm next door at Gangplank a couple times a week and we usually hit this place up for lunch. It's much better than the last place that was in this spot, has tons of options (we decided you could eat lunch there for a month and not have the same sandwich), and friendly staff. I'm definitely glad they put this in. It's a great option in the downtown Chandler area."}
{"text":"I am a creature of habit and sometimes miss good places while I frequent places I'm familiar with.  I used to go to Firehouse Subs when I was craving a sub, but finally drove on Dobson instead of Alma School and realized there's a Planet Sub over there at Dobson and Germann.  Now that's our goto place for subs.  I still like Firehouse a lot.  Their brisket sub is mouth-wateringly delicious, but every time I go there it's a total C.F. and really crowded and I'm more stressed out when I leave, so I save that one for when I'm already stressed out and sweaty.  

The service is always top notch at Planet Sub and I like the daily specials like a $2.50 turkey sub on Tuesday and the double stamp day for the punch card on Wednesdays.  We've tried the Yello Sub, Torpedo, Pesto Bello Combo, Big Dipper, and the Meatball Grinder.  All amazing & made with fresh ingredients on toasty, crusty wheat bread.  I want to try the Smoky Southwest Chicken because that just sounds wonderful.  

They are not fast food and definitely worth the wait (which is not long).  I like that we can call the order in and it's ready when we get there."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to Planet Subs last night. I feel it offers a tasty choice to the big boys of jimmyjohnsjerseymikesquiznosfirehousesubs. 

Sorry, I've always wanted to try a run on.  Two days ago, I tried the Mom & Pop place, Can't Stop Smokin BBQ. Now, here's another locally owned family place. As I lamented in my other review, 'There is so much homogeneity in our dinning experience today. Everything is so cookie cutter.'

Yet, here is a small place trying to get a toe hold into a very competitive sandwich market filled with the afore mentioned giants. But the only problem is.... is.... that Planet Subs is also a Chain.  D'oh!!  Albeit, a very small one. 

I had their toasted Dagwood's Dream, which I thought was tasty but somewhat lite in the quantity of meat they put on it. It certainly didn't look (photo) like the old Blondie comic (photo) strip. Yet, it was tasty and I will probably come back to try it again. If I do, I will absolutely ask for extra meat. LOL

Their Premium Sandwiches run $5.99 for the six inch and $8.99 for the twelve, which seems like the new norm in the industry, except at Jimmy Johns. 

So Planet Subs is Three Stars, \"A-Okay\" in my book, just ask for extra meat."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, dining outside was pleasant. I had the Greek wrap to limit carbs. It was ok but nothing I'd crave. My husband had a turkey sandwich. It automatically comes toasted which he didn't realize and doesn't prefer, he also felt it was skimpy on the meat. We would probably need to come back and try again but not sure we would go out of our way to do so."}
{"text":"I found this gem when I was searching for a quick (but not greasy fast food) bite in downtown Chandler. I tried the California Veggie Sub, which was good. Its not the best sub I have ever had but it was healthy, vegetarian and tasty. 

I was impressed that they had a lot of vegetarian subs, a lot of sub/sandwich shops only have 1 or 2 but they had 6, which all sounded good (actually I didn't look at the menu too carefully when I ordered, and some of the others sounded a lot better than the one I ordered...next time!). 

The restaurant was nice and clean, and the staff was friendly. I would definitely go again when in the area."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is amazing. The portion is just right--not giant, yet not too small of sandwich. The ratio of meat/veggies to bread is perfection. This is one of the best sandwich shops I've been to, and I've been to a lot. You can tell their bread is baked fresh every day. It's mouth-watering!
Service is great, location is always clean, and prices are fair."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place, so I was happy to finally have a chance to met here here for lunch one day.  I wish that I had joined here there a lot sooner.  The sandwiches are amazing!  Hot , fresh and filled with flavor."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and always made fresh, hearty portions at a great price, staff is always professional and friendly"}
{"text":"Had the \"experience\" sub. Was the perfect amount of spicy. Chicken was juicy, and there was plenty of meat on the sub. Also had a s'mores cookie which was delicious as it sounds. Came here because I received poor service at a different restaurant next door and planet sub MADE MY NIGHT. I met Emily at the register and met the owners mom Barbara. The service was amazing. AND THEY DELIVER!! so happy I wound up here and will make this a new staple of places I get food from. GREAT EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"Great place to get your sub sandwich fix!  Fresh with great taste!  I have to eat Gluten Free (allergy) and love that they make their own gluten free bread daily!  Much better tasting than most GF bread.  The only down side is the cost to switch to a GF bun........but it is expensive no matter where you go...that is if you can find the option.

Staff is always friendly and I order from their app and pick-up.  Easy and good!"}
{"text":"Awful. Awful. Awful making a decent cheesesteak is not difficult. This had zero flavor and was overpriced. Will not try again. 

** update. The Regional Development Manager contacted me to try and resolve the issues. I have to say this was a really classy move. A good business knows that to improve customer traffic and retention, you should always offer an amicable solution when a customers experience is bad. Kudos for that. I would have to increase my rating just for that."}
{"text":"I got the Southwest chicken sub and it was really good! It was loaded with toppings and had too much chicken on it that it was falling out as I ate it. It had a little bit of a spicy kick, but wasn't too overpowering. I also enjoyed that it was a toasted sub. If I lived in this area I would return again. They also offer wraps instead of subs if that's your kind of thing! 

However, my sister got the cheesesteak and let me tell you this is NOT your average cheesesteak. The meat looked like deli meat and it was very bland. I would highly recommend not ordering it as I think you will be disappointed. Stick with the toasted or deli style subs instead. 

They also offer a happy hour special during the week where you get a regular sub and a beer for around $7. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here a lot now - enough to take advantage of their weekly deals. Sign up with your phone number and you'll get texts alerts with their ongoing promotions. I've seen everything from $2.99 6\" subs to 5.99 footlongs. Remember, the subs here are not your average sandwiches. These have freshly toasted bread and a generous helping of meats, cheeses and toppings. If you're looking for a quick cheap sub (think \"freaky fast\"), by all means there is a time, place, and appetite for that! Here, the subs take a little longer, made behind the scenes, and the employees will come out and deliver them to your table. My wife and I split the BBQ chicken sub today, which was pretty good. My favorite is still the marquee \"Planet Sub.\""}
{"text":"Stopped here today for lunch with my sister. I was excited to hear this place was family owned, so I wanted to show my support! 

The staff is super nice and attentive. Everything is also super clean and they have no problem addressing questions, concerns, etc. 

I ordered a half buffalo chicken sandwich with their blueberry tea. It was okay. The sandwich was really dry, even with extra buffalo sauce. It had weird lime and pepper spiced flavor on the chicken, sauce, lettuce and tomato. The sandwich was over toasted as well. I wouldn't recommend it or order that again. Lol it was definitely weird. 

I'm not going to lose faith, and I'll definitely come back someday just to try something new in hopes today was just a fluke!"}
{"text":"I went to pick up a sub for lunch on 2/17/17 at 130pm and was waited on by the sweetest girls ever! I didn't catch their names but my gosh were they nice. Great customer service and my veggie sub was perfect!! Thanks again ladies :)"}
{"text":"Although its not the least expensive, I believe that they offer the best sandwiches available. Big meaty sandwiches, fresh bread, made fast. Always a win. Dagwoods dream is a must try."}
{"text":"Had a Sunday lunch with my wife at Planet Sub on Dobson/Germann. I must agree with those previous reviews that mentioned \"meat scarcity\"!
Their rolls are quite good and were lightly toasted. I ordered a Green Turkey described as \"Oven Roasted Turkey, Bacon, Cream Cheese, Guacamole, Onions, Sprouts, Tomatoes, Salsa and my wife The Experience described as \" Signature Chicken, Bacon, Pepperoni, Pepper Jack, Cream Cheese, Jalapeños, Chipotle Sauce.  Flavors on both were nice but I couldn't taste what meat was in the sandwich due to the small quantity within.  If they doubled the meat and added a couple of dollars, they would have hit a home run!  The place is clean and staff is friendly but I do not feel compelled to return."}
{"text":"Decor is schizophrenic and low budget, staff is friendly. Order half hoagie... it is hot and tasty. A bit too much dressing but better too much than too little. Bread is good and fresh could of used toasting on the inside (open face) before being dressed to add crunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place. Sub places are a dime a dozen, so you can't be average if you're going to survive. 

I ordered the planet sub and asked for no mayonaisse, which is usually a simple request. I got my sub to go, so it wasn't until I got all the way home and unwrapped the sandwich to find it covered (I mean drenched) in mayo. Come on! You can't get that right, you're not going to make it. Well the sub went right into the garbage and I won't be back. Take pride in your work and get your customer's orders correct."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times with the hopes that maybe it'll be amazing this time. Usually there's too much sauce or the bread is baked to a dust. Today was another case where it wasn't amazi. I ordered a full Dagwood today and I'm pretty sure half my sandwich was missing roast beef. When I finished the first half of my sandwich and started on the second I was convinced my second half was a different sandwich. Like maybe someone I got half my order and half somebody else's? When I was eating the first half I was disappointed with how little meat there was. But then I looked on the website for what's in the dagwood. And lo and behold my first half of the sandwich had ham and pastrami but no roast beef. And then bam I eat the second half and there's a giant clump of roast beef. 

UPDATE: So after my initial review I received a reply from the manager and several coupons to give it another try. This time I ordered a 1/2 or their Italian sandwich (I forget it's name) and it was much better than my last experience. The meat was all there, the toppings weren't in several big clumps, and the bread was soft and not crumbly. 

I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the vegetarian options and I love that it is right next door to Gangplank! I get my lunch at Planet Sub and walk on over to the Wednesday Brownbags. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Good sub,  decent prices. A notch above the regular chains... I'd definitely pick this place over them."}
{"text":"Finally open! Subs here so far are Excellent. There are a lot of options on the menu and bread is fresh made with that big mixer in the back. They redecorated the whole place and rebuilt all the counter and table areas. I've been hearing rave reviews from people that have eaten there in other locations and I can confirm, at least with my first sub and the other 30 or so people here at Gangplank that have eaten there already, that Planet Sub subs are in fact... damn good. Think the best of when quiznos was actually good and when subway used to be the shit... it's like that but in one place. :)

They say breakfast is coming soon too. WIN. Go there... enjoy... say hi and come over to Gangplank and work and eat :)"}
{"text":"I love coming to Planet Subs. It's right by my work and every time I have came in for lunch I'm in and out and don't have to wait long to get my food. The sandwiches are fresh and lots of variety to choose from. On certain days they have specials and the sandwiches are cheap. On Tuesday they have turkey sandwiches for under $3 and on Thursday they have veggie sandwiches that are around $3 :)"}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite. If I were to compare it to Subway I don't think they'd even be in the same world. It's THAT good. Everything is extremely fresh and you can tell. They have numerous sandwich choices you can order hot or cold but their toasted subs are what they're known for. I'm always impressed when we come here. So happy they're expanding to new locations!! The kids meals are also a great deal, so inexpensive!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see them add romaine lettuce wraps to their menu and went last week to try. I was a little disappointed especially in the size. I had the buffalo lettuce wrap and thought it was lacking in substance. It was very, very small especially for $6. I don't think I would order another because I was left hungry after the last one."}
{"text":"Get the app before you go! You'll get $7 food credit after spending $99! 

Here's how it works- order at the counter and be sure to say if you want your sandwich warm or cold. The default is warm so be sure you specify. Use the app at the counter and then receive a playing card for your order. If you are lucky like me, you'll have the lucky card and get a grab-bag gift. I won a water bottle! When you're order is ready, they will call out your card and deliver to your table. I ordered two halves: a green turkey & a smokey southwest chicken. Boyfriend and I split each half and we both preferred the green turkey which includes:
Oven Roasted Turkey, Bacon, Cream Cheese, Guacamole, Onions, Sprouts, Tomatoes, Salsa. I always order without tomato but if you like them, they would pair so well with the ingredients. 

The half subs are $5.50 and the whole subs are $8.50. Obviously a much better deal getting a whole but we aren't big eaters and wanted to start knowing the menu. My next visit will include another green turkey and something new. 

Worth noting: they have vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options. They also cater and have a birthday club. Yeap, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place and it ended up being a good experience overall. 

My husband got \"The Experience\" sub and it was ultra spicy! He liked it but it would have been too hot for me to eat if I had ordered it. 
I had the cheesesteak which was different from usual because it came with creamy Italian dressing on its instead of mayo. It was good.
The prices are good. Our two subs plus a \"pizza boat\" for the little guy was only about 12.00. 

Biggest pro: the bread is very good
Biggest con: no fries for a side dish....only chips."}
{"text":"I like to give a place a few tries before a review. This was my third trip to Planet Sub. After trying a different sub each time I will say that there is nothing that sets this place apart from any other sub shop. Jimmy Johns, Penn Station and Planet Sub are all pretty much the same. I do enjoy all of their subs but I wouldn't drive out of my way for any of them. So if you are in the neighborhood and want a good sub, stop in. Just don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, excellent customer service, easy ordering, quick to bring food to table, delicious taste. 

We came here with a discount card we were forced to buy from my boss whose son plays high school football. We ended up with two large subs, a drink, and chips for only $8-9. Steal of a deal! 

The variety of subs they offer is very unlike the cheesy chain sub places. The bread is delicious and they use enough meat on the subs for you to enjoy every bite. 

I recommend this place for sure and will use that discount card again when I'm in that area!"}
{"text":"This place was fabolous to eat at, HORRIBLE to work at.
Im not shocked in the least that it closed. The owner was very rude and nasty. I hadn't worked there for more than 15 hours and she was calling me a retard to the other employees, telling I need to be running from the car to the restraunt after deliveries-which stupid AF because that would only save about 5 seconds. She encouraged other employees to be mean to me and when I had to step outside because she told me she wouldnt have hired me if she had known I had Lupus, she and other employees mocked me and locked me outside forcing me to walk around to the front of the building. I only worked here part-time to earn extra money for a trip me and my now husband were going on between school semester. I quit before I had even worked there 24 hours. One employee that managed another location of hers that also shutdown was in the process of leaving the job when I was hired on and he told me to leave ASAP and that the owner was a mean spirited woman. I should have listened but oh well I got my paycheck and Im thankful I dont ever have to see these people again."}
{"text":"Too expensive!  I prefer other sub places like Port of Subs for the same price.  I like picking out my toppings and seeing what they are doing...

The staff was excellent though."}
{"text":"Planet Sub is great! Definitely stop in if you're sick of your usual sub shop. Tons of interesting menu items, including a From the Sea section, and some Low Carb options. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I had the Mega Roast Beef sandwich, and the Greek Wrap on two different days, and both were amazingly delicious. They offer the option to toast your sandwiches, and both times I had them toasted, and they were perfect - warm and not too crunchy. The prices are good, and they also do a great job in making party trays.  This location will be introducing breakfasts very soon."}
{"text":"Never had a bad sandwich here. And the app is really convenient and easy to use.  The ham and Swiss and the super hero are both really good. Great service and the place is kept up very well. The quality is definitely better than other chain sub joints although I would liken them very closely to Firehouse.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good sub joint!  You can get them hot or cold.  Situated in the cool downtown Chandler area ir is good for lunches!

I would recommend a little wider chip selection. 
As far as a sub it is definitely a step, or three, above Subway or Quiznos."}
{"text":"I have no clue what caused me to eat here but I'm glad that I did. I'm not a huge sandwich person, but I really loved the Tempeh Parmesan. I've had tempeh before and it's usually so over cooked at restaurants to the point that it's inedible. This tasted really good, I even wondered to myself if it was actually tempeh. I got half a sandwich, a side salad, and a drink for about 12ish dollars. Seemed a little expensive for what I got, but not horrible since I was pretty full after. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. They were all really sweet and got my special order right. Id definitely come back. The place seemed really clean too. I wish they would take the calories off of the menu because it's slightly depressing"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch at Planet Sub that just opened up South of my house. My Fiance and I have both worked for Planet Sub's in Wichita and Kansas City and were very sad to move away from great oven baked subs! I got word that P Sub opened up in Chandler and went down for lunch and had an AMAZING southwest chicken sandwich and my fiance had The Torpedo. Everything was as i remember it 4 years ago. nothing beats Fresh Baked Bread made IN THE STORE and that chicken is to die for. if you are in the area then be sure to stop here for a sandwich! i hope Planet Sub expands down here!"}
{"text":"It looks like a chicago style pizza but tastes nothing like it. The sause is a bit bitter and burned.  Cheese is great. Over all I dont like it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Unique and yummy subs. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"We came here from out of town.  Had good sandwiches, great customer service.  We got the food to go, but the atmosphere of the shop was nice.  If I'm ever in Chandler again, I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Hot food good so good I love this place go here get cheesesteak it so good and fill you up and cookies yummy"}
{"text":"Delicious! Hubbt and i had a great time. Helpful staff awesome oven baked subs.  I had the experience sub and my husband the dagwood. Both were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  The whole is too big for one sitting, but certainly good for lunch the next day.  Best feature is the Mexi-Coke.  Nice chip selection too."}
{"text":"The quality of this place has gone down considerably since they opened. At first, they were very friendly and the food quality was very good. However, since then both service and quality has gone down considerably. The last couple of sandwiches have been okay at best. To the point, that I won't be going back any time soon. Service too has gone from friendly to \"oh, we have some business to deal with\". I would say to try someplace else."}
{"text":"They have a drive-thru that's open during the day during certain hours, really friendly staff, great subs, made fresh and fast."}
{"text":"Great subs! I recently discovered this gem of a sub shop while having my car repaired down the street. The bread is soft and hot, the meat is fresh and tasty and the veggies are crisp. I have had their featured specialty sub simply called \"The Experience\" two times now and both times it has been amazing. It has a combination of chicken, jalapenos, banana peppers, cream cheese and bacon, everything is better with bacon, especially this sub. They also have a student meal deal with one of the basic subs such as turkey or ham and cheese with chips and a drink for $5 which I may take advantage of because I am a student at CGCC down the road. The subs are all toasted and they have a wide variety of options including vegetarian and seafood. I will be coming back to this sub shop quite often. Now I want a sub..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop. I've tried them all. Fresh ingredients, always fast service. I'm hooked on the BLT, you'd think that's a sandwich that all places can master but Planet Sub makes the best!! The wheat bread is amazing. I won't go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by accident, what a great surprise! Several veggie options and not just iceberg lettuce and sad veggies. I recommend the californian, the flavors were perfect and the bread was soft and crusty. The staff was kind and took time to explain all of the sandwich options, even letting us try samples! Absolutely recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to SHARE our lunch... the sandwich we just had, The Experience... is HUGE! The flavor and taste is CRAZY good! But the bread makes it AWESOME!  Great place, and the staff is NICE! It's a Win/Win meal for me..."}
{"text":"Tried it again and had just about the same experience as before. A very sloppily made sandwich with crumbling bread and greasy vegetables. This time I tried the Dagwood. I just don't know what to say. I was contacted after my first review by a manager stating he wanted to make things right and that this is not their standard. I responded to him saying I'd be willing to hear him out. I got no response after that.  I took it upon myself to try it again when I was in the area and took a friend along with me. He was not very impressed either. In fact, he got a soda that was all carbonated water out of the machine.  He ended up just getting iced tea instead. So I don't know what to think. I find it hard to believe I just happened to be there on two different days that both were below the supposed standard.  All I can say is this is strike two. I don't know that there will be an opportunity for a third. I've already wasted enough money."}
{"text":"The subs are fantastic and fresh. Great shop and great customer service. My husband and I go all the time. We are life long customers.

My favorite is the Torpedo and my husbands favorite is the Smokey Southwest. Mmmmm...delicious!!!

I would strongly recommend trying Planet Sub for yourself."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with this sandwich. The girl behind the counter was awesome in helping us on our first time. Ill be back for something a bit different next time.

EDIT: I have been back three times now. 2nd time was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but then the 3rd and 4th time was not so good.. little meat, not such a great choice of the sandwich on my part.. I still give it a 4 because the awesome customer service (even with a new guy.) and the amazing sandwich i had the 2 times."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches. The lady at the register is kind of dumb though.  She might have some mental issues..."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy the meatball subs from here but, one time I unwrapped my sub and found a long black hair in the sauce. It really grossed me out and we weren't given a refund. After that I didn't go here for another few months. Now I always look to make sure they wear hairnets."}
{"text":"So previously i would have given Planet Sub 4 stars because their food is reliably good and delivery is ninja fast and super friendly.  

Well, today I tried the tuna, and it was cloyingly sweet and greasy and vile.  I like some relish in my tuna, but this was nasty.

My other point of contention is that they don't have in house delivery anymore!  I called to place my order and this Kardashian with vocal fry was like \"Yeah? We don't do delivery anymorrrrrrrrre?? You have to do that through the order online or grubhub or ubereats?\"

I asked how much delivery would be.

\"I don't know? It's different for all of them?\"

Ugh.  The ham and swiss was really good though!  

Get that."}
{"text":"Great service here. I asked for some mayo and 3 employees just about dropped what they were doing to help me. Good gluten free options, especially for a sandwich shop. Everyone seemed really happy here- makes for a pleasant lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Other sub places promise fresh-baked bread, but when you taste it, you can tell it's made of frozen bread dough that's later been thawed.  This place really does do their subs on fresh-baked bread.  My favorite sandwich is their Big Dipper (essentially a French dip sandwich).  Good place, not bad in price either."}
{"text":"Love this place! I work down the street and visit often for lunch.  I have to admit, I have only ever had one thing - I'm a turkey sandwich lover (I know, plain jane) so I go to PS a lot on Turkey Tuesdays. The bread is delish and the turkey and toppings always taste fresh.  My only recommendation would be to not order the 'avocado' because it's actually the guac-style dip instead of fresh slices.  Otherwise, great place. Oh, and another plus, they have Cherry Coke on fountain!"}
{"text":"We go here a lot for lunch and love it! The staff is always nice and the food is great! 

They like to hand you a playing card so they can call your order when it's ready.  We have made a game of trying to keep the cards and make a full deck out of them.  They keep trying to take them back but so far we are winning :D"}
{"text":"A sub shop with vegetarian options include tempeh?!? Color me impressed.  I'm very glad to have found this place."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken is the best! Also, you get free 6 subs every couple of times you go there(if you sign up)!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out for the first time about 4 wks ago when my office moved into the area. I have had three different sandwiches (Crab Californian, Big Dipper and the Pastrami Melt) and everyone of these were AMAZING! Very fresh, flavorful and no after tastes as I would get from JimmyJohn's. I also keep ordering their Garden Salad that is made with wonderfully fresh vegies!  AND THEY DELIVER at this location.. SUPER PLUS in my books. I wish they had a location in Gilbert too!  The employees have always been super nice on the phone and during their deliveries. LOVE THIS JOINT!"}
{"text":"Not good. All bread and grease and not good bread. Would not recommend trying since there are so many other sandwich shops around."}
{"text":"Every time I come in here, the staff is so friendly! They're always on top of everything. The food is great of course but the staff really pushes it over the top! I'll always come here!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch today.  We had a recent Living Social coupon, so it was a good opportunity to try the place.  Simply put, excellent.  I had the Pastrami Melt (pastrami, pepperjack, kraut, mustard), and my wife had the Dagwood's Dream (don't ask me for the list of \"stuff\" on it!).  Very flavorful, lots of meat.  We would (and will) return."}
{"text":"A great and preferred alternative to subway and its family owned so that gives me more of a reason to come back again and again for all my sub cravings! And they have SPROUTS!!! Like that's unheard of anymore!"}
{"text":"Tried the Dagwood something or other, it wasn't bad.  The bread was outstanding."}
{"text":"Love their subs - toasted/warm! Every sub we have tried, we have loved. Great service too! 

We have even used them for a catered event, and the subs were great and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Wow. Crafting a good sandwich really isn't that hard, I'm not sure why so many places around here can't do it. But this tasty joint gets it. I ordered for delivery and like most people I was terrified that I would receive a soggy ball of mush. Instead, the bread was perfectly toasted, the tight wrapping around the golden torpedo allowed the party of flavors to dance in warmth and the delivery was perfect. Quick and friendly. If and when I meet Neil Degrasse Tyson I will look him in his galactic eyes and say \"Fun fact: Planet Sub is the newest edition to our Solar System. BOOM... How bout dem bosons\""}
{"text":"I heard about this place so I thought I'd give it a shot..... I'm glad I did!!!!
Being that it was my first visit, of course I had a ton of questions and the young lady who helped me Tiana, was very polite and more importantly she was patient with all my questions. I I just got the feeling that she was really concerned with me being a happy customer which you don't see very often now when you deal with the public in general. She made a few recommendations I went with them and when I got home I was very much impressed with the taste of the sandwich, and the quality of the ingredients to put the sandwich together. I will definitely be back and yes I would recommend this sandwich shop to everyone in search of a good fresh bite to eat!!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried pesto bellows! Awesome!! The flavor is perfect,  the bread is warm and soft.! I will go back to try something else!"}
{"text":"Pesto Bello yumm :)"}
{"text":"Not for me.  I stopped by based on a couple of good seafood sandwich choices on their website.  Sadly they didn't even make them anymore.  So I settled for a plain tuna sandwich.  When they handed it to me I asked why it was hot and they said we make ALL of our sandwiches hot.  I am fat.  There are only a few things I won't eat and hot tuna is at the top of the list.  They remade it into a cold sandwich for me.  Sadly their tuna is super sweet like they are using Miracle Whip instead of Mayo.  Second on my list of things I won't eat behind hot tuna is Miracle Whip or sweet mayo.  Strike one missing menu items.  Strike two hot tuna.  Strike three sweet tuna.  And I'm out.....of here."}
{"text":"Ordered a Greek chicken wrap and a Philly cheese steak hero for delivery. Food came quickly and was still nice and warm. That is where the compliments end. Wrap was completely bland with almost no Feta cheese at all. The mystery meat in the \"cheese\" steak hero had a weird rubbery texture and a matching strange taste. Their prices are a fair bit less than other sub shops in the area. I guess you get what you pay for?"}
{"text":"I've gotten food here twice. The first time was delivered to work. It was so good I had a couple other coworkers want in the next day. I stopped by the store to pick it up on the way in. The store was clean, the service was friendly, and the food was excellent, again. This is definitely my new favorite sub spot. I ordered the experience sub and I highly recommend it. It's full of flavor and does not disappoint (though I add banana peppers for a little extra kick)."}
{"text":"I made an order for delivery on a Sunday evening and I was not impressed. I requested no lettuce on one of my subs and it was obvious they put lettuce on it and then tried to pick it off.  The bread was soggy as well.  The cookies I received were paper thin and the peanut butter cookie had a very weird taste to it.  I'm not sure I'll try this place again."}
{"text":"Had some subs delivered and the bread was nice and warn had the Planet Sub signature and it was good and delivery time was actually good"}
{"text":"I opted, by recommendation, for Dagwood's Dream, pastrami, roast beef, ham, mozzarella, onions, lettuce, tomato, and horseradish. All sandwiches are warm, at least, that's how they recommend them. All in all, I'd say a great deviation from the regular sandwich place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I entered this restaurant confused and left confused.  We entered through the back door, same set-up as what neighboring Chipotle has, and walked into a little disarray.  People were standing around randomly so it wasn't clear where to go to even order.  Eventually we figured it out and got in line.  We ordered and were given a queen of clubs playing card. No further instruction. The lady already moved on to the next in line, so we walked over and helped ourselves to chips and the boys got their beverages. I ordered a local beer (choice of two drafts) which was eventually brought to me by the manager. After about 5 minutes, a guy comes out of the back calling for a queen of clubs. By that time we had figured out that's their gimmick- instead of getting to know what could be a regular customer by name, you're given a card to identify your order. While we ate, it was interesting to see we weren't the only ones confused by the card.  The food was good. But then I wasn't sure what to do with my trash and my beer glass. So we left it. 

I'm giving it an optimistic four stars. I don't see it ever being better than that. And, I'm afraid I may end up downgrading it after my next visit. But, maybe they'll figure out how to create a better customer experience."}
{"text":"Another great spot in my neighboorhood! 

I had never eaten and a Planet Sub so I perused the menu and the gentleman behind the counter offered some advise.  I settled on the Chicken Parmesan sub and a cup of Chicken Enchilada soup.  My daughter got the kids meal with a grilled cheese, chips, and a drink.  The total was just under $14.  Great value!  My sandwich was delicous!  And the soup was tasty and had just a little kick to it.  My daughter loved her grilled cheese with all the yummy melted cheese and fresh baked bread.

While were were finishing up one of the gentleman that was working in the back came out to ask us how our dinner was.  He was in from Kansas helping the store with some minor issues.  It appears those issues have been fixed because I told him everything was great and we would definetly be back since we live close by.  

Who doesn't like fresh baked bread and fresh ingredients?  They also have a punch card so that's another great incentive!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Since we moved to our new office in Chandler Planet Sub has been our go to place for lunch!  They have a ton of different options and their staff delivers to our office.  Very helpful as we don't have a lot (or any...lol) free time to go to lunch.  Great little lunch spot in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Tasty! Bored with other area restaurants we frequent, we settled on Planet Sub delivery to change things up. I couldn't be more pleased. I would post pictures, but both subs were gone before I thought to snap a pic. 

Our order was delivered faster than expected and the delivery person was kind. Our sandwiches were well-wrapped and still warm. Both sandwiches had special requests (no tomatoes, no mayo, etc) and everything was accurate. The sandwiches were super tasty and very filling. I would say each sandwich was roughly 14\" long. 

Overall, this was a total win. I can't wait to try my next Planet Sub meal."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich shops of all time.  Being from Midwest I have known them for years but they are starting to get a few places in the valley.  The bread fantastic. My favorite sanehich is the Tijuana taxi.  You have to like a little heat with the jalapeños and the beef is great.  If heat is not your thing the Dagwood is the next best thing.  Enjoy a great sandwich at planet sub."}
{"text":"PS has been getting a lot of my lunchtime business lately.

Usually go for the sub, but on a whim, decided to order a Chipotle chicken wrap.  Why do they call it a wrap, because essentially, its a sandwich, in a burrito.

I'd much rather be eating a \"Sanrito\", which makes me think of Hello Kitty.  Conversely, the \"Burwich\" makes me think of Burma, now called Myanmar, which makes me think of self-immolating monks... which brings me right back to the roasted chicken in this here wrap."}
{"text":"Pretty good baked subs. Had a Ham n Swiss, and then the Bacon Mushroom  melt..

Clean location, Little over priced, 1- Footlong 1- 6\" and 2 drinksn chips 20 bucks.. 

Probably drive up to Krazy Subs next time, but think they are closed Sundays...

:-)Rank 3.5 but cant do half stars.///"}
{"text":"decided to try a different sub shop for lunch and I ordered the turkey sandwich and it's just A-OK.  i did love the freshly baked whole wheat bread. it is a good value and decent sandwich.  I didn't see anything that made them stand out from other competitors.  this might change in the future but for now three is on target."}
{"text":"LOOOOVVEE the subs here!!! Super delicious & makes you want to come back for more!! Everybody is super friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxed. The multiple menu options have something for everyone and the subs will leave you feeling satisfied!"}
{"text":"Best sub in town...PERIOD. Great bread, great meats and the perfect ratio of ingredients, wonderful sub!"}
{"text":"Brak likes.  The sandwiches are very tasty, and the bread, their claim to fame, lives up to the bragging.  The meat & veggie quality seems to be high.  On the downside, the sizes offered are 6\" and 12\", with the 6\" being a bit on the short side for me, and a 12-incher being WAY too big.  Would be nice if the \"small\" were a 7-incher, or maybe offer 6, 9 & 12?  Also, the sandwiches are a bit heavy on the non-meat items, a la Subway (hate to even use that word in this review), with the meat portions being rather thin, especially given the rather high prices.

I've also tried the cole slaw & yellow potato salad, and both were fresh and excellent, though again I thought the portions were rather small relative to the price.

All in all, I like the place and now visit regularly.  My minor gripes don't change the fact that they make a very tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"I really, really, really like Planet Sub. I tried them for the first time last week and actually went back again yesterday for lunch and I'm debating on going again today. I'm obsessed with their big dipper sandwich and they have daily specials so I've been getting a huge sub sandwich and au jus for like $5.99 every time. My only hang up is that it comes with raw red onion and I can't handle onions that aren't caramelized so now I get my sandwich without and it's ten times better. I also sub extra mayo instead of horseradish but I should probably give the horseradish a try. Both times I've come here with my husband and he's a big fan too. He ordered their version of an Italian sub, the name of which escapes me right now, but he really liked it. I made him try my sandwich and now he's a big dipper fan too! We split a foot long yesterday and I remember the glutton in me wishing we had just gotten our own, lol. There are a few other sandwiches I'd like to try such as the creamy club (I love cream cheese on every/anything) and my favorite thing about Planet Sub is that their bread is made from scratch. My dad makes his own bread and Planet Sub's bread taste like a lighter version of my dad's, I love it. It really makes all the difference. It gets a little busy around lunch time but the service was still speedy."}
{"text":"What can I say - it's OK... I picked up a tuna for the hubby and it wasn't what we expected. It was a tuna salad - with pickles and all that other 
rubbish! I didn't like it - just tuna and mayo folks simple is better!

Maybe we will have a better experience next time - but with the sammies being a bit more expensive, I guess I thought it was going to be super good! It wasn't ... Drag!

It's so close to home - I will give them another try - their menu is pretty extensive - I have to find something we like!

Update soon Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, but I did notice management just stands around and was very snobby towards me. Didn't make any eye contact, and rudely handed my sub to me. Was not the customer experience I'm used too. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had a veggie sub and it was really quite good. Fresh baked wheat bread, and toasted so the veggies were all yummy-gooey with the cheese. Can't wait to try more, I have a feeling they are going to get a lot of business from me when I'm at Gangplank."}
{"text":"I was at work and saw that this place offered delivery (which is awesome for someone who only has in reality 25 Minutes for lunch) and a coworker recommended it. I placed my order and set the delivery time as one that was going to be okay. I'm not allowed to touch my phone while on the clock. They called to tell me they had substituted the salad I ordered. Okay, fine whatever since they took care of it without delaying my order. However I got upset about the delivery driver being rude and forgetting my drink. The driver begrudgingly went back for my drink. My sandwich was cold - like taken out of a fridge which was disappointing and disgusting. So needless to say, I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love subs and had actually intended to go next store to BurgerFi when I noticed this shop I hadn't tried before. It wasn't very busy but the atmosphere was nice. I ended up ordering a staple of mine, Turkey Club with chips and drink, though chips choices were very limited. 
They give you a card to identify your order, which is unique as I'm sure some people don't want to have to give their name. 
The sub arrived wrapped up and hot (no warning given to me about it being hot -not that it was burning, but still should be done - didn't even know I could have had it cold as mentioned in another review here). The sub was sub-par taste-wise. It was a good size but it was bland. I don't think they even put any mayo or salt and pepper on it (I know mayo isn't listed but it is fairly common to be on this type of sub). They should tell you about you can add the condiments yourself as you choose. I did add mayo and the taste improved a little. I don't know if I'll be back as I shouldn't have to season my own food at a restaurant and it just didn't taste very good even so."}
{"text":"Ordered today for a delivery for my fiancé and I. He got a half BBQ and I got a half green turkey. His sub tasted alright but was composed almost entirely of BBQ sauce. My turkey sandwich resembled more of a sprout sandwich with tomatoes. There was one... I counted ONE, thin piece of turkey for the entire sandwich. The \"guacamole\" was only on one end and maybe a tsp worth. I feel this establishment has potential, and maybe we ordered at a busy time. We, however, were very unimpressed after all of the great reviews we read."}
{"text":"I'm so happy these guys are here. I work next door at Gangplank, and the previous sandwich shop in this location was okay, but really started to slide downhill. Planet Sub totally renovated the place (looks great), breathed new life into it, and came out swinging with a diverse and tasty menu. You can really tell they're working hard to make this a great experience, and the sandwiches I've tried so far have been excellent. Look forward to going back soon!"}
