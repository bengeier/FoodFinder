{"text":"Food is good; if you know how to order. Untrained staff has difficulty explaining menu and how to help customers order!@!! Second time through and worse than the first!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars. I was excited to try it after reading the reviews, but I was underwhelmed. The sauces are really good but the rice is lacking in flavor. They were also out of pita and fries when we were there at ~6:30pm, which was disappointing as I was looking forward to trying the hummus bowl with pita. I would also agree with other reviews that the portions were somewhat on the smaller side."}
{"text":"Best version of chicken shawarma that I found so far, wish they had regular fries but I can honestly say that I found the best combination: chicken shawarma pita with pickles, fries inside and garlic mayo!!! Yum"}
{"text":"Valerie offered poor customer service. This is the second time I have been and every time bad customer service. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"$9-10 for three falafel in a bowl? Workers rush you through the line, are short with you, and expect you know everything and don't ask questions. This is not a burger joint, most people do not eat this type of food or have never had it before. Customer service was horrible, food was minimal for the price and they rush you through even when you're the only one in line so they can get back to whatever else they're doing that's more important. Voiced my opinion to corporate, who apparently doesn't care enough to even respond. Not the best business model when you're new in town. I'll walk down to Palmyra or the Banzo food cart before going here again. You've been warned."}
{"text":"I brought my family to this place while traveling through Ohio. The best way to describe it is Americanized Middle Eastern food - the same way most Chinese restaurants are Americanized and unauthentic. It was a little expensive IMO. As far as I could tell the \"schwarma\" was fried and not cooked on a spit. Instead of Tzatziki sauce they had mayonnaise with garlic. Pita bread is supposed to be unleavened. Not in this alternative reality. Too bad the food doesn't live up to the decor."}
{"text":"Naf Naf was pretty darned tasty! I ordered the steak shawarma bowl with rice, onions, pickles and the zesty harisa sauce, a pita on the side, a side of the fries and a piece of baklava. The main dish was delicious! The beef was tender and flavorful on its own, as were the onions. The pickles were also tasty, and reminiscent of Tony Packo's pickles in Toledo: spicy-sour-crunchy goodness. The pita was ok. Missing something, but I can't figure out what. Too fluffy, closer to Wonder Bread than an authentic pita...but if you want authentic, why are you here? The fries are..well...fries. Nothing special about them, and probably would skip them in the future.   The staff was friendly and helpful with first-timers, but I would recommend checking out the menu online BEFORE coming in, as some of the ingredients are going to be unfamiliar, and the line/menu location kind of makes no sense.   Is it authentic middle eastern cuisine? No. It's as authentic middle eastern as Chipotle is Mexican. But is it good? Absolutely!  Can't wait for one to open closer to West Park!"}
{"text":"I went there today for the preview opening, free pita, \"fries\" and a drink.  When I got there the line wasn't too bad.  They had someone passing out Falafal in a cup and handing out t-shirts and sunglasses. They also had a DJ playing.  Those were nice touches and the DJ let me practice my youtube-learned dance moves, so that was cool.  Inside the place has a clean, modern decor.  stainless steel tables and steel and red chairs. The idea is to order your style (pita or bowl) then fill it with meat/falafel and other goodness.  Since today was a preview, it was Pita only.  Typically I'd opt for the bowl (gotta keep the carb intake down to maintain my stunning physique) but free overrides carb limit so...  My pita was filled with hummus, Chicken Shawarma, chopped salad, sumac onions, and S'khug, which is the less spicy of the two spicy sauces.  The Pita itself was warm and soft. You can see them making them as you come in, which is cool.  You get a good amount of what you choose.  The Pita was good and the S'khug sauce was spicy but not too bad.  Everything tasted fresh.  I will say that because I got the Pita, there was a bit of a layering effect, so It wasn't until I was halfway done before I got any of the hummus.  The fries are actually homemade potato chips.  I liked them.  They were fresh and had a good mix between crunchy and flexy chips.  They were not heavily salted and was a nice contrast to the pita itself.  It almost had a sorbet effect, albeit a warmer, much more potatoey sorbet.  This is in the same strip mall as Melt, so parking is a pain.  Remember there is parking behind the building also, as well as a rear entrance (hehe) to Naf Naf.  I thought the meal was good and filling, and they did a good job making the opening day fun. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Quite nice - a bit pricey for what it is but a nice change (think chipotle with a med feel/vibe) - but don't expect anything authentic - Place is very clean and service is great. Had the chicken bowl with hot sauce with a pita on the side. Would recommend for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The service was super friendly and though they had a line to the door it moved fairly quickly.  I ordered a falafel pita.  I had a choice of hummus or baba ganoush, I asked for both and got a partial scoop of each.  There were 4 falafel balls and then I had my choice of toppings.  I had the chopped salad, onions, pickles and tahini for a sauce.  No sides or drinks and it came to $6.64.  Right in the ball park for a sandwich and no sides at other places, a little less than some even.    I didn't find it overly salty as others did.  I tried a little hummus plain that fell outside my pita and it was a bit bland, but at home I use alot of garlic and lemon something most resturants are scared to do.  The baba ganoush had a flavor I didn't care for, and the cilantro in the onions was off putting.    The pickles were great and maybe the best part of my sandwich.  While the chopped salad was just that, chopped lettuce and tomato, the falafal balls were mushy. They were crispy on the outside but the texture inside was a little too soft, they did offer a nice flavor though.  But again I thought the tahini sauce was somewhat bland and could use more actually tahini add some nuttiness to the sandwich.    The pita was nice and soft, and baked in house which was nice.  All in all I can get better falafel at Banzo for the same price, Naf Naf does have a softer pita and nice pickles, as well as the eat-in option if the weather is bad.  I don't think this will be a regular part of my lunch options, but I wouldn't avoid it either.  The \"combo\" upgrade for $2.99 seems pretty pricey for a fountain soda and a small cup of soup, chips or rice."}
{"text":"I personally LOVE this place- usually get the bowl with rice,steak, and all of the add ons. However, i took some of my friends and 4/5 had the opposite opinion as me. Not sure what it is, i guess if you like different types of food you'll like it, but if you've got a boring pallet, id try a burger place."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. It is always good when new food options pop up in our area.  unfortunately I don't know if I really liked it.   I ordered a rice bowl with chicken, along with a side of falafel and hummus.   The good:  Falafel and hummus was really good. Both tasted fresh and get my two thumbs up. The pita bread that comes with the orders was also very good.  Fluffy and tasty.  The bad:  The basmati rice tasted undone. The rice was still hard. The flavoring on the rice was also underwhelming. I love rice in general...this rice was not good. The chicken needed more seasoning.  Didnt taste any different from bland chicken you could buy at fast food joint.  The sauce options were just eh.  Neither of the two (mango and tahini) made the rice bowl taste any better.   If I were to return I would order a pita with falafel and hummus.  I would skip everything else.   I don't know if I just came on a bad day or what happened.  TBD"}
{"text":"I had a steak shawarma in a salad bowl. It was really good. It kinda reminded me Chipotle food but with different kind of sauces and toppings. Pita bread was excellent."}
{"text":"I love the chicken shwarma bowls- yummy with extra veggies, garlic sauce, and hot sauce!  they have excellent pitas as well which they bake themselves."}
{"text":"Their pita were very good , really enjoyed the meal in there, and i liked their fries which were fresh ,not the typical frozen ones ( i am crazy about fries). Will go there again , it's fast , affordable and somewhat healthy."}
{"text":"Just as someone else had said, it's basically the Mediterranean version of Chipotle, and IT IS AWESOME! Price is pretty similar to Chipotle, and they have such a cool variety of condiments to add to your order. I ordered a falafel rice bowl, and I thought the consistency of the falafel was great, and hot sauce was delicious without burning away all your taste buds (although as someone with a high spice tolerance, take that statement with a grain of salt). The best part is that they're really nice about giving you more onions or sauces etc if you ask for it :)"}
{"text":"Falafel is phenomenal , lol I'm cheesy... so this restaurant was really good everything was fresh !! And did I meentioj the falafel was phenomenal"}
{"text":"Incredible! The flavors are divine. The food is so fresh.    The pita is so fluffy and perfect, not like the hard store bought kind. I have enjoyed it each time we go!"}
{"text":"I've been in twice since they opened, and I think the food is delicious.  I had good service on both visits as well.    The one drawback logistically is the sign/menu placement.  The descriptions of the sauces are around the corner where you cannot see them while ordering.  I am not sure what good that does anyone.  I would rather see the menu with prices first, if anything, so I can start to narrow down my selections before the food comes into view.  I will probably be back, and would give 4 stars if it were a little cheaper.  $7+ for a pita, and and extra $3 for a side and drink just seems out of line with the prices at other fast-casual places in this area."}
{"text":"They have groovy customer service and I was immediately greeted upon entering. There's a young man who always makes sure to drop fresh falafels for me when I come in. They are cooked perfectly and the garlic sauce tastes great with them."}
{"text":"An alternative fast, casual option that I would call a Mediterranean Chipotle but with better quality, fresher ingredients.  I filled up today between class with a falafel couscous bowl, topped with cabbage, cucumber salad, baba ganoush, onions, garlic tahini, and a spicy sauce whose name I cannot remember. The couscous was fluffy, the sauces packed a punch of flavors, and the vegetables were crisp. There are a lot of distinct flavors in your mouth, and I like mixing and matching each component rather than stirring up the whole bowl.  The reasons I didn't give five stars is because service is meh in that I feel extremely rushed, ambiance is mediocre and lacks personality, and Naf Naf errs on the more expensive side considering the plethora of options on State Street nearby."}
{"text":"Love this place and their Chicagoland locations. The falafel is my favorite plus the pita! This is a great addition to State Street's food choices and it will be a regular stop for me in Madison.  Come on over to Milwaukee Naf Naf!"}
{"text":"This was my family's first time here and we won't be back. We all left not feeling well. The food was like warm instead of the meat being hot. I went to change my daughters diaper in the ladies room and there wasn't a changing station... which is fine, that happens but the bathroom floor was filthy and was my only option to change her. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"SUMMARY: Overall, a very good addition to State Street, but if Banzo's sit-down version added itself to State Street, watch out.  Many below have said that this is the Chipotle of Middle Eastern food, and in terms of decor and setup, that's definitely the case. The menu is definitely one of the healthiest (at least before you add things to the items) on State.  I have high expectations for shwarma after spending some time in Denmark, and while Naf Naf wasn't quite that level, it was pretty good. Nothing outstanding, but I've only tried one combination once. I still think that Banzo's flavor profile is better, but one can't always get out to Sherman. The falafel was quite good, and overall my pita sandwich was tasty.  Skip the fries, they're not the point of this restaurant and they're not great anyway."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place but it was just blah. The employees behind the counter seemed extremely annoyed and rushed to be working there even though I was the only person in line. The girl that was there was the only pleasant one working. I got two chicken shawarma pitas with hummus. The girl passed my pitas to the guy working next to her and he looked visibly annoyed because she apparently put too much chicken in the pita. He went back to get a new pita and forgot to put hummus in, of course. He got to the next pita and picked out the chicken that was \"too much\". I asked for cabbage, salad, onions, and tahini on both. One was left without cabbage of course. The pita was drowning in tahini so by the time I got home(about a 7 minute drive) the pitas were soggy. I would definite recommend asking for all sauces on the side if you are taking pitas to go. The fries are pretty good. The chicken was a little cold. It just feels like it's missing something. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really liked this place and it reminded me of Chipotle. It's a refreshing change and I enjoyed the various combinations available for the Chicken Shawarma bowl. The ingredients were fresh and everything came together nicely. I feel that you get a lot of value for your money because I had leftovers for the next day. I also added on hummus and that was very tasty too. I plan to make another trip there soon!"}
{"text":"Rice was good, chicken was good. A little disappointed that it is quite a bit extra to add hummus on a shwarma bowl"}
{"text":"Very good food. Had the falefal bowl. Pita and Hummos also very good. Good portion. Good value. Everything $7-$8."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how good this place was! Very yummy. Atmosphere is nice. They're very slow service wise though and should have WAY more options (whole wheat pitas, more veggies, etc)."}
{"text":"I like the food, and the late night hours are outstanding, but if you order delivery dont expect your food to be warm when it arrives..."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good! My husband and I decided to check it out one Wednesday night on the way to a local activity group meeting, and we're glad we did! Now we go nearly every Wednesday. It's not fine dining; more fast-casual like Chipotle. The food is actually on the healthier side, which we appreciate, and is very tasty!  You first pick if you want a bowl or a wrap, and pick a base. So you can pick lettuce, hummus, saffron yellow rice, or couscous. Next is your protein, which is falafel, beef or chicken shawarma. They have actual meat spits for the shawarma, which is the correct way to cook the meat for this style. This is followed by choosing your topping(s), which include pickles, onions with ground sumac (something you don't see at a lot of places!), cabbage, cucumber and tomato mix, and a variety of sauces. I especially love their orange colored tart mango sauce-a little tart and a little spicy!  It's very clean inside, and the people behind the counter have always been very friendly. They are constantly making fresh pita (which is amazing!) and fresh falafel. Yum! We highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"They have the best pita ever! I love the hummus. I always like to order extra hummus and pita for later. I didn't think I liked middle eastern food until I ate here. It's the middle eastern version of chipotle. If your looking for a light but filling meal this would be a good choice."}
{"text":"First time here. Guy behind counter explained everything to us. Very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our meal. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find. Fresh Middle Eastern food, in Independence!  I had a chicken shwarma bowl with rice and tahini. Yum. I also had them add a Falafel ball to the mix. It was delicious.  Everything was fresh and one of the employees came over to ask how everything was. Keep in mind this is set up like Chipotle or Piada.  I will most assuredly be back. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"I had a Chicken Shwarma hummus bowl and it was excellent!!  The green hot sauce is delicious.  Next time I will get a second scoop.  Had fries.  Lame even though they were just out of the deep fryer so forget about them.  You can get a bowl of Lentil soup and a pita bread for around $3.25 if you want to go low cost.  Staff seemed very nice."}
{"text":"New favorite fast casual restaurant! Healthy options, including vegetarian, that were filling an delicious. The fries are AMAZING and not like any fries I've had. I had the hummus shawarma bowl for my first visit and was very pleased. Smooth hummus, flavorful meat, and my choice of toppings. Warm, fluffy pita on the side was delicious. Can't wait to try more of their options!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a Chipotle style of restaurant, but if you are craving Middle Eastern food, like I was today, it is a pretty handed place, being so close to campus. I had the Hummus bowl with steak shawarma with the chopped salad, red cabbage and onions with the tahini sauce, pita bread on the side. I took my cue from what many of the people were having in the dining area as to what to order. Even though I came in at around 3 pm, the line was substantial, but moved quickly. It was pretty good and filled me up, even though it was salty. I thought the combo was a waste of money and extra calories I didn't need, so I stuck with the water they had on the soda fountain. Have to put in here that instead of the hummus, I could have had the green romaine lettuce they had on offer. For those that don't want a pop or the free water they do have a small refrigerated case of plain and flavored waters by the bottle/can and containers of their hummus for sale. Jesse S. is right; you can get better Mediterranean food on State Street much more inexpensively. Last, I have to say, if you want to eat your food there, it is very loud and noisy with nothing to absorb the sound, but since your out and in pretty quickly, it is not as bad as a place with wait service."}
{"text":"So great! Love everything-- the food, the people and the atmosphere! Don't leave without falaful!"}
{"text":"Very good pita bread and meat in the shawarmas! Kind of expensive but worth it if you are looking for a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Delicious food just visiting the area for work and found this great vegan friendly place. That would be nice if they made their way out to Maryland/D.C."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting the food to be this good.    Had the chicken shawarma hummus bowl.  Neat middle eastern twist on the chipotle concept.   Great hummus. Great shawarma flavor.  The chopped salad was very fresh and crisp.  The basmati rice was awesome as well.   Great clean ambiance."}
{"text":"We tried the Naf Naf Grill for lunch today. What a great find. You order at the counter and similar to a Chipotle, you pick the fixings and they prepare it while you watch. Options include a pita or a bowl filled with falafel, chicken, or steak. Hummus or baba ganoush. Additional toppings include pickles, purple cabbage, and cucumber salad. There are numerous sauces to top it off. I liked the spicy jalapeno. They also offer rice, soup and chips which they call fries. Prices were completely reasonable.  I had the pita filled with falafel. My pita was puffy and just slightly chewy and completely held together with the fillings. Both the falafel and the hummus were exactly the textures and flavors I hoped for. The pickles had a wonderful bite and flavor. The cabbage and cucumber salads were both fresh and tasty. The chips were crunchy, just a bit salty, and super tasty.  Quick, tasty, and relatively cheap. I was very pleased with the entire experience. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had just run two miles and was looking for something healthy to eat. At first, I was going to go to another place nearby but stumbled upon this place and thought I should give it a try.  I've never had this type of food but... wow. It was incredible. I had to ask for suggestions from the people working there because I didn't know what anything was and they created the perfect dish.  100% recommend! Don't be afraid to ask for suggestions!"}
{"text":"It is rare to find a place that is both healthy and filling... this place is exceptional because it is BOTH healthy and filling. I got the hummous bowl with a little bit of rice, steak, cucumbers, tahinni sauce, and a piece of fresh warm bread. The atmosphere inside is very clean and comfortable. Staff is friendly and courteous, will definitely return soon!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food was disappointing. They tried to charge my father for someone else's order because they \"assumed\" they were together... How unorganized can you get? They tried to charge him for two meals and he didn't even receive his food! Someone else took it with their order!!! Get it together please. Save your time and money, go to Alladin's across the street."}
{"text":"So here's the good:  Best tasting Falafel I've had outside of Israel.  Period.  Oh and awesome prices and portions  The bad:  Their food doesn't agree with my stomach.  I won't go into more detail but this would be a 5 star review if I didn't have stomach issues EVERY time I eat there.  But i can't stay away.  It's sooo darn good."}
{"text":"When I'm not feeling like eating at the food carts I love coming to this place for lunch on State Street. I especially like ordering the couscous steak shwarma bowl and naffing it up (adding a drink and side). Their portions are big enough to make for a nice light meal for 2. Their fries are in between a French fry and a potato chip, and I really enjoy them (sometimes they are a bit too salty though)! The lentil soup is also a delicious side for a cold day."}
{"text":"I love this place. Since Naf Naf opened, I've been here at least once a week. Easily the best fast food on State Street and probably all of Madison. Staff is super friendly and some of them already know my order since I've been here so often."}
{"text":"Try half rice half salad bowl. Falafels are perfect. The very hot sauce is very hot but I love it. I wouldn't recommend their fries."}
{"text":"My husband is obsessed with Naf Naf, as he frequently works in Chicago. He was thrilled when one opened in Madison and we were excited to try it the first week they were open.  I have eaten Naf Naf a few other times, and the quality of the food at the new Madison location was the same tasty food I have grown to enjoy in Chicago. I always get the falafel pita with cucumber salad, onions, and garlic sauce. I was surprised to see another review complaining about the pita, because honestly, the pita is probably my favorite part of the meal. It is so soft and warm and tasty and...I kind of want one right now!! My husband's standard order is the chicken shawarma pita and an order of his beloved fries. The guys working behind the counter when I was there were super informative and friendly. I asked a few questions and they answered everything with smiles on their faces!  I have two complaints about the Naf Naf on State Street. The first is trivial, but annoying enough I feel I need to mention it - the decor is seriously lacking. I totally get that Naf Naf is a chain and they all look the same, but they look boring.  State Street is a fun place with a fun vibe, and I kind of just felt like I was eating in a cafeteria. It was just so sterile and boring. I highly doubt there is anything that can be done about the decor, but man, if I were in charge, I would sure try.  The more significant complaint I have is one that has been mentioned in other reviews - the overall amount of food that you get for your money is a little disappointing.  Again, my husband has eaten at every Naf Naf in the Chicagoland area, (and I have eaten at their downtown location) and  every time the pitas come overflowing with so much goodness that they are almost difficult to eat. The Madison location gave me a pita that was only about 2/3 full with a ton of extra pita at the top. I love the pita, so I didn't mind eating it plain, however, it really felt like they were skimping out. I know we will be back to Naf Naf many times to appease my husband's cravings, and I hope that they increase their portions so that patrons feel like they are getting their money's worth!"}
{"text":"I really like Naf Naf but not so much the Madison location. The one in the milwaukee area is very clean and has exceptional customer service. This is lacking in the Madison location."}
{"text":"I dream of the schwarma bowl more often than I would like to admit. Pro tip: skip out on the spicy sauce...Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"I'm already obsessed with this place! My friends and I call it the Mediterranean chipotle! I love the chicken schwarma! It's fast and convenient, but it is a little pricey for the portion size. They're a bit stingy with their toppings...even their lettuce! But I usually ask for extra lettuce and they don't give me a hard time with it."}
{"text":"Now we have a chipotle of middle eastern food. Prices are reasonable. Lots of vegan options. Ingredients are fresh. The spicy sauce is really spicy and I didn't realize that so will be careful the next time."}
{"text":"In summery: good quality, poor quantity - limited value.   Naf naf has some place for improvement  - I think the quality of food is great - but the quantity decreases the overall value. I have had shwarma all around the world - and typically they fill the pita with at least 3/4 of the way - with Naf Naf, my pita is typically half way empty, and the limiting factor is the quantity of  meat (which is understandable from a business/profit perspective but as a consumer not so great). Also, If you want to supplement with fries or other additions - it becomes even more expensive - which again decreases the overall value. I have been to 2 chicago Naf Naf locations and felt they were a bit more generous (perhaps they had a bit more competition)."}
{"text":"Went on a trip to Israel this summer and it has caused me to CRAVE shawarma on days that end in \"y\". Anyways, this was the closest rendition of Israeli street food that I've found in the states. Falafel is dope and shawarma is on point. But the aspect of this place that differentiates it from other Israeli spots is the pita. It is light and fluffy and is (once again) the closest I've found to the real deal pita.   Notes on the place: think chipotle in terms of seating and style but it is clean and the people are nice. Ain't no white table cloth place but it doesn't need to be for me. I will be back to this spot."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Falafel is good and the fresh toppings really set it off. Fries are made fresh(so you might have to wait a few extra minutes for them) but better fresh than sitting around. They are cut circular so look more like a chip but still have some French fry soft-nest to them. Fries are $2.75, Fries + drink is $3.00. Didn't get a drink since I only realized the $.25 difference after we paid and sat down. Took a star off because it seems like their pitas got smaller from the last time we were here. Maybe just an off batch? ?"}
{"text":"Not bad, been twice. Got the chicken both times and it is SUPER salty - you'll find yourself thirsty all day just to balance it out. Wouldn't easily go back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, on its opening week and another time with my siblings. Both times were good and we all liked it! It's nice to see some variety in this area besides sandwiches and its good if you wanted to try middle eastern food other than Aladdin's in the area. When you stand in line to order your food, you'll see the workers making pita bread and it goes through a conveyor belt and you get to watch the pita bread puff up so that's pretty cool to watch too!  I tried the steak shawarma pita and fries the first time and the steak shawarma rice bowl + pita another time, and both portions were pretty filling (I thought the bowl was more filling since the bowl also comes with a soft and fluffy pita). The fries were more like fried slices of homemade chips but were good. I also appreciate that compared to other fast food places in the area that this place is not as salty but is very flavorful, and a majority of the food that is served is veggies. I feel healthier eating here and I don't have that greasy feeling that you get from eating fast food so that's a bonus! When you get to the register they have an assortment of baklava and other sweets they sell that I didn't try yet but look good if you are interested!   I wish they had more choices of middle eastern food like kafta, shish kabobs or grape leaves but it is a good place to go if you are looking to try something new or if you are new to middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"Naf Naf is like a delicious Middle Eastern Chipotle. The menu is short and streamlined and you order in an assembly line style, making it super quick and perfect for lunches between classes or in the middle of the work day. There isn't a ton of variation in the options, but you can mix and match meats, salad additions, and sauces, so I've been to Naf Naf a few times and gotten a completely different meal each time. The decor is pretty sparse and while it's comfortable to eat in, I wouldn't bring a date here or anything. Overall a solid lunch eatery and take-out joint for a quick lunch or dinner and a nice addition to the burger and sandwich options on State street."}
{"text":"Not impressed w/ this location. I LOVE Naf Naf and if this would have been my only experience, I may not ever want to go to another one.   I visited on Saturday 4/28/18 and ordered the Schwarma Pita $7.35 - the chicken was scant, the girl taking the order was not personable, and the place was dirty- over flowing trash, tables hadn't been wiped down- ugh- get it together!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Naf Naf was a little odd due to a self-centered older man who twice let doors start to shut in my face even though he saw I was two steps behind him. Once inside he cut people and went straight to the front end of the line where he proceeded to confuse everyone by trying to pay for and take someone else's order. The poor guy he was hijacking had to have his order remade and wait awkwardly while a group of employees tried to figure out what happened. The old guy was led back to the start of the line. You can't teach manners, but maybe a sign that says \"Start here\" would be helpful.   No issues with staff. Interior is clean. Parking in front or back. Prices range from $6.50 for a falafel pita to $11.75 for a steak shawarma combo with fries and a drink.   *Veggie Feast $8.95 - Sooo good! I would definitely get this again! 4 crispy tasty falafels with hummus, chopped tomato and cucumber salad, purple cabbage, sumac onions (very potent), and baba ghanoush plus a fluffy side of pita bread which was soft and perfect to scoop up my dips with.  *Chicken Shawarma Bowl $8.20 - Also comes with a fluffy pita. Not a bad salad at all, you can choose between rice, lettuce or hummus, then meat, some veggies and dressing (mmm garlic sauce).  *Fries $2.75 - Not fries, more like half crispy half limpy homemade chips. Only one size. Maybe would be better if they had some Middle Eastern seasoning you could sprinkle on top? Mediocre, would probably not waste the calories on them again.  *Baklava $1.60 - At first bite I was like \"what is this, watered down syrup?\", but then there was this faint flower taste. DAMN ROSE WATER! Get out of here rose water! No one really likes you! Would not get again because I don't like perfume flavored food.   I'd put this in my rotation with Dolce Wraps and Sittoo's. Simple, affordable, dishes are filling and tasty for the most part."}
{"text":"Spent $83.00 on food that tasted like it was pre processed and came out of a can. Will NEVER deviate from @Tarboosh again. Authentic Food. #tarboosh. #tarboosh parma."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place and crave it often. They have really good food and it's reasonably priced. I would recommend getting the app on your phone since it gives you a free entrée just for downloading it."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved coming here. We've never had middle eastern cuisine before this and now we're hooked. I had the chicken shawarma rice bowl, I'm completely full. My friend and his mom had the steak shawarma bowls, everyone satisfied. We came during the taste of Madison, not overly busy and very quick."}
{"text":"Looks like they are still working on getting systems in place. For a chain, this is poor form. As for the food, the falafel was okay, the fries were better than expected, the lentil soup needs more flavor and a side of lemon, the chicken bowl was a bit disappointing in both taste and food quantity for cost.  I would go to Boaz in Ohio City instead."}
{"text":"Friendly service and DELICIOUS food. I had the falafel rice bowl. Highly recommend getting the purple onions and the spicy sauce too. Pretty healthy food that is quick and inexpensive."}
{"text":"We lived in the Middle East and were very intrigued about this place. It isn't a food option we are accustom to seeing stateside and even more so done right.   It started out great when we saw the meat spits were from Germany and they were using the correct shavers. Service was very friendly and quick.   The falafel were not the best, but it was inline with how Americans usually eat them. Nice to see Tahini and pickled veggies as options. The rice was just okay (no ghee maybe?) but overall a great/quick snack.   We will be back for sure. You should too."}
{"text":"Am I the only one getting sick of the burrito fad? A Mediterranean twist was a great idea. I dig this place and I hope it's part of a new trend! Pretty fresh ingredients, and plenty of choices from steak to falafel to pickles to hummus. I love that the salad/rice bowls come with a pita, too. Prices are similar to burrito bars. Forget the Chipotle-Qdoba battle and move on over to Naf Naf!"}
{"text":"I LOVE NAF NAF!!! It's literally a middle eastern chipotle. You pick what you want in your bowl and they fix it up for you right in front of you.   The meat is also freshly carved daily in front of you. There's not much to say other than the food is amazing! No matter what you choose. They give you great portions and it's for a reasonable price. I love NAF NAF and I can't wait to go back.   Parking: there's a parking ramp a few stores down."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Great food as well. The hummus bowl was good but kinda watered it down. Also best falafel I've ever had."}
{"text":"Mediterranean food served Chipotle-style. The food is great and you can eat healthy here if you order mindfully.  Pita is baked fresh and you can see the meat roasting in front of you.  This deserves 5 stars for what it is-a fantastic quick service lunch or dinner spot.  Great addition to Independence. Hope you add another location in downtown Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mediterranean inspired quick place ever!! I've gone twice at this point and the only reason I don't frequent it on a weekly basis is the drive there. Let's just discuss the different options. It's set up similar to a chipotle. You have your base choice of rice, couscous, or hummus. I've done both the rice and hummus bowl. Their falafel is beyond amazing, better than any Mediterranean restaurant in town, in my opinion. The rice is also superb. Both times I crafted my bowls slightly different and was super satisfied both times. Also I would absolutely recommend to \"Naf it up\" and add the bomb \"fries\". They look like chips but have the consistency of a French fry. Seriously awesome! Everything is super fresh tasting and so delicious.   My only negative, which is hardly anything, is the fact that the Independence location seems to be the only one in Northeast Ohio! I need more Naf Naf!!"}
{"text":"Great for what it is. I've gotten the hummus bowl, salad and rice bowl before and definitely like the rice bowl the best. The hummus bowl was really good but not having something else with substance, it ends as a sloppy mess. The pita is also really good, especially if you can get it right when it gets out of the oven.  I feel state street needed a healthier fast food option so it's definitely a nice addition."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a meeting today and was pleasantly surprised! I was told by friends it was a middle eastern style chipotle and they weren't wrong! The flavors however are 100 times fresher and better! I did feel a tad rushed since it was my first visit and didn't know how many toppings I could get but it was still spicy fresh and delicious!! I got th hummus bowl with falafel, salad, onions and the red hot sauce. Staff was on point too. Highly recommended!! ."}
{"text":"Me and me wife both agreed there are much better shawarma around town. She got here with baba ganoush. At least it had a smoky flavor. The chicken wasn't very flavorful. The atmosphere was too white. Gave me an operating room feeling or something. Between all the alladins, sittoos, or the Mediterranean Mart in Parma heights, there are better options. I'm sure there are better yet that I haven't tried as well."}
{"text":"Very tasty.   Yummy hummus and the garlic sauce is  on point The chicken is always very moist and flavorful  Get the fries as well"}
{"text":"I really liked Naf Naf grill. If you enjoy falafels, this is a great place! My husband got the steak instead of the falafels, and he didn't love it. He wished he had ordered the falafels instead. But overall, it was an enjoyable dinner. And it was very reasonably priced. It's super fast and the food is pretty delicious."}
{"text":"I tried Naf Naf tonight and it was...ok.   This is pretty much Mediterranean Chipotle. You pick a bowl or a pita and fill it with meat (chicken or beef), rice, veggies, and sauces. Instead of paying extra for guacamole, you pay extra for hummus.   I had a rice bowl combo with chicken, pickles, onions, \"garlic sauce\" (yogurt based?), hummus, the hotter of their two hot sauces, and a size of Naf fries. This came with a nice sized piece of pita bread and a soda.   The pros: - it's a nice space.  -Everyone was friendly and helpful. We'll see if this lasts.  - Their hot sauce is actually hot. Not ghost pepper hot, but definitely hotter than Chipotle or Qdoba's hottest salsas.  - It filled me up and tasted pretty good overall.   The cons: - It was massively, massively overpriced. The combo came in at something like $13.50. For 7 bucks I can get a falafel and drink at Banzo or a delicious meal at Mediterranean cafe. This wasn't as good as either of those places, so why should I pay almost twice as much?  - The flavor was decent, butting was a bit salty, greasy, and lacking in depth.   -Naf fries were a disappointment. They're not fries. They're freshly cooked chips. Not bad, but I'd prefer fries.   -Nutritionally, it was a disaster. It came in at almost 1200 calories, 54 grams of fat, and 1450 mg of sodium. It was a big meal to be sure, but if I'm wracking up those kinds of numbers, I want to feel like I've indulged in something decadent. This didn't feel like that. I'd love to use this place as a quick lunch option, but I can't unless I want my waistline to expand. The real pity is that it doesn't need to be so damn unhealthy. Cutting down on grease and salt would make it taste better, not worse.   Edit: So after giving this place three stars I ended up eating there every day this week. That alone justifies a bump up to four stars.  I don't know what it is about their chicken shwarma pita, but I really, really like it. Nutritionally, this is a much better option than the rice bowl, especially if you avoid the fries. I'm also happy to report that they are more than willing to give you extra toppings on request. Just don't get tricked into the combo: it's a total ripoff."}
{"text":"They advertise themselves as being the \"Chipotle of Middle Eastern food\" and they are exactly that. Just like Chipotle is not \"authentic\" Mexican food, Naf Naf is not authentic Middle Eastern food. It's good for what it is. Fast food. Prices are around the same as what you'd pay at Chipotle: about $6.50 for a vegan (falafel) pita wrap, $7 for a chicken shawarma wrap, and $7.50 for beef shawarma. The assembly line and employees still need to work some kinks out (for example, I as asked three times if I'd like to make my meal a combo; I had asked for soup at the beginning of the ordering process and this was not communicated down the line). The food is good, about on par with Chiptle. Portions are also decent. Is it as good as Banzo (as another couple sitting next to me loudly exclaimed)? Nah, but it'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Naf Naf Grill is shwarma and falafel (Middle Eastern street food) brought to you Chipotle-style. The Chipotle similarity is everywhere, beginning from when you step in and see the minimalistic, industrial decor including metal surface tables. The color scheme and design is slightly different with a red color scheme and oversized traffic signs featuring a camel for \"Yield\".  Like Chipotle, you order your food at a full-service bar that features Middle Eastern, instead of Mexican, ingredients. There are basically 3.5 items that you can order: Chicken Shwarma, Falafel, and Steak Shwarma, plus a Veggie \"deluxe\" option which is a deconstructed version of the service bar (the main vegetarian components, that is). The first three entree items can be ordered in a pita or as a bowl: rice, couscous, or salad. After the main ingredient, you indicate additional items of your choosing as you move along the bar. These includes: a white or purple cabbage salad / slaw, seasoned onions, sauces (tahini, white sauce, a couple spicy ones). Menu sides include fries, lentile soup, rice, extra pita... There is an option to \"Naff it up\" by adding fries and a fountain drink for $3. (Either one of those items alone costs close to $3.)  Writing on the wall will tell you that Naf Naf's philosophy on ingredients and food emphasizes freshness, quality and authentic flavors. It seems consistency is also present - behind the service bar are two spits where the chicken and steak shwarma tantalizingly rotate and simmer in their own juices. However, you won't see any person slicing meat off the spit, instead the spit itself has an apparatus that slices the meat with clean, mechanized strokes. Certainly consistent, but tasty?  The chicken shwarma was moist and delicious and possessed a distinct curry flavor that I hadn't encountered in other shwarma. The pita was a nice touch - it's baked fresh and that was obvious. Fries were tasty - instead of long sticks, they are semi-circles cut from the cross-section of the potato; a crispy edge where there's a trace of potato skin and a softer center.  Naf Naf loses a star because of price. With the entree prices coming close to $8, you will easy be over $11 after any sides and/or drink, or if you Naf it up. Maybe I've had too many falafels from food carts or street vendors but that price feels a bit steep for Middle Eastern street food. Yes Chipotle was similar in raising the price of a burrito or taco, but it seems easier to stay under that $10 mark and the Chipotle feels like a bigger 'boost' from the ordinary burrito. Certainly, it can be hard to riff on falafels, but Naf Naf certainly tries by offering high quality additions and fresh-baked pita bread. Maybe the price point will grow on me over time... For now, Naf Naf Grill is an excellent option for some delicious shwarma and falafel in a sit-down setting, worth at least one visit if you haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"WOW! This place was so good that I had to call (I did a take out order) mid meal and tell them how amazing the food was. Both hubby and I got the chicken basmati rice bowl, mine included the onions. I got a side of the S'khug (green hot sauce) and garlic sauce, side of pita. He got a pita too, along with the naf fries, which was too much food, next time we will skip.   The pita is oh so soft I mixed the S'khug and garlic sauce into my bowl and it was out of this world. I know we will be back, try new sauces and meats.  Thank you for a great meal that was quick convenient and the staff was super nice and helpful too."}
{"text":"Food was so so good- I had the Veggie Feast and got to try a variety of items. EVERYTHING was delicious and very fresh (crispy falafel. hummus, tomato and cucumber salad, purple cabbage, onions, pickles, baba ghanoush). Loved the fluffy soft side of pita bread baked fresh. The ONLY reason this is not a 5 star review is some logistics- with a long line out the door, the line moved slow (with many workers on lunch break they have time constraints and local businesses should be staffed and trained for a quicker turn around) adding to the long wait time is some customer confusion w the menu not being totally clear- more descriptions of items w clear prices, options and what exactly are the different sauces would help the customers help the staff get people out the door quicker. Will definitely be back and looking forward to trying out online ordering too!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but the portions for the price is ridiculous. They upcharge for everything. There are other places that sell authentic cuisine for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Honestly, I love this place! As a vegetarian, they actually give me options. The falafel is AMAZING! I used to have to buy the nasty, slightly dry stuff from the grocery store, but being able to walk into Naf Naf and order good falafel for 50 cents each has seriously improved my quality of life.  Reasons it doesn't get five stars include the slightly expensive prices. While the falafel pita isn't that pricey, I did notice that the meaty options were a little high up there.  It also kind of annoys me (this goes for \"build your own\" places in general EXCEPT Pancheros) that the ingredients are not mixed up very well. I don't really like taking five bites of pita and salad, then five bites of pita and falafel, and then five bites of pita and hummus. I'd much rather taste them all at the same time :)"}
{"text":"Why is this place so stink delicious!  The chicken shwarma from here keeps having me come back for more! It definitely satisfies my cravings and isn't as good as some places I've been to in Chicago but it's darn close to it!  The chicken isn't dry like some places I've been to for their chicken shwarma.  It has a nice amount of seasoning to it and goes perfectly with whatever sauce you decide to add to your entree. I love their garlic sauce on the side so it's easier for me to make sure I have a taste of it in every bite.   They also had baklava available to be purchased which was so delicious!! It was very very sweet and rich in flavor and had just enough crunch with the nuts and puff pastry.  Usually the bottom of the baklavas that I have tried is soggy but this place didn't have any sogginess to the pastry!  Would definitely come here again for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Friendly service whenever I visit. I like middle eastern foods and found  this place to be the best. Their rewards program actually rewards customers. Their menus are easy to follow and understad. Their pitas are soft ans chewy. I visit Naf Naf whenever I can find them."}
{"text":"This is the type of place I'm going to complain about all the time yet still go back very regularly.  Despite my complaints, it offers fast food that isn't awful for you. I can only go to Chipotle so often and Freshii is too far away. If Madison had more options for make your own salads and wraps, I might not frequent Naf Naf as often.  After trying a few things, my go to will probably be the chicken shawarma bowl with half rice half lettuce. Getting as close to chipotle as possible here.  The chicken is tasty, the meal is satisfying and it doesn't make me feel gross when I finish.   Things I dislike: - It's pretty expensive. I pay much less at chipotle, even with guac (which we all know is extra). - I don't love the rice, I may switch to just lettuce. - Hummus is a bajillion dollars extra. It's mean. - NO TZATZIKI? Rude! - The \"salad\" (the tomatoes and stuff) isn't as good as it could be neither is the pita. Obviously not authentic Middle Eastern. -the fries are soggy and just really not good"}
{"text":"This place is the Chipotle of middle eastern food.   Atmosphere: very very bright. Fluorescent light paradise. I like the color scheme though, and the layout was fine.  Service: fast, friendly. No complaints here.  Food: my friend and I ordered hummus, fries, and falafel balls. The beverage options were fountain drinks, and a few bottles choices. Not a fountain drink fan, I stuck to water. The fries are more like fried potato chips, which were very tasty. I was surprised at the cut, defiantly not what I was expecting. The hummus was good, but the real winner were the falafel balls. Very flavorful, and at 50 cents a ball you can get a good amount for a decent price.  Overall a good experience. I think for me this would be a good take out spot as opposed to eating in."}
{"text":"Been coming since opening week,  been several times.  Tasty fast food, quality ingredients.  Love the couscous, pita bread, falafel, baklava.  Like the bowls with the choices of sauces.  Tasty chips also."}
{"text":"Naf Naf... Who's there? I'm putting this place into my lunchtime rotation. Good eats for a good price. One of the bowls is really two meals. I've had the chicken coucous bowl, chicken rice bowl, and the veggie plate. So so so good! The side of bread that is baked right there is to die for! and the hummus is so smooth and tasty. I like the pickles, cabbage and tahini on my bowls. There are a lot of options to choose from to add to your bowls. You can get toppings on the side too. I sampled the mango sauce before I put it on my bowl. I'm glad I did. It was not what I expected and was not too good (my tastes may be different than yours). Others in line with me said that they liked it."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner, around 5.  Was greeted as we walked in.  The staff was extremely helpful and very positive attitude. I had the chicken schwarma bowl with all the fixings.  Coworker had the steak schwarma bowl.   The food was fresh, good and reasonably priced ($9) a bowl.  I would definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Finally an authentic fast casual Lebanese/Mediterranean restaurant that can compete with the quality of Aladdin's and Taza! Well done! The food, quality, cleanliness and attention to detail are amazing. I ordered the falafel bowl with pita and added a drink, fries and naflava(naf's baklava). This was seriously the best meal that I've had in a very long time. While I was eating Tad and another person from his staff I believe Matt stopped to ask me how my meal was. They offered to refill my drink and even offered me another pita on the house after I had complimented how delicious it was! Wow is all I have to say. Kudos to Tad and his staff, they are truly a great team. I will definitely be back very soon. The Naflava was so good words cannot describe it, you must try it yourself."}
{"text":"The food is really good - love that there are vegetarian and vegan options. Also love the throwback music. The customer service is especially sick - you can definitely tell you're not at Lotsa."}
{"text":"It's pretty simple, if you like Chipotle then you'll probably like this place.  Let's just say if it's too cold and Banzo truck isn't outside on State and there's a line out the door at the Med, walk down to Naf Naf! It's fast and the employees are super friendly.   I always get the Chicken Shawarma bowl, but they have a nice menu of other items to pick from."}
{"text":"Try it! I I was looking for a healthy option on state street before a school activity. I see falafel, and thought what the heck, I'll give it a try. I had a chicken schawarma hummus bowl. When she asked what I was wanted in it, I said yes to everything pretty much. It was a good choice. I got a huge bowl of food and a great variance if you enjoy like a Qdoba bowl but want something different. At this point, I didn't care if it was healthy or not because it was so tasty. Don't walk past it again without giving it a try!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. The food is decent but really overpriced. The service lacked any type of charisma or care. Based on that alone I probably won't be back.  The pitas are really good and there are some pretty good condiments and sauces.  It is no Sitoo's, that is fo' sho'!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best falafel and pita I've ever had! Went to the free pita day today which was their preview opening. The place was packed, but the food was still super fresh and so good. They had a DJ playing which I thought was cool, but all of the staff was super friendly and looked excited to be there. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. The food is reasonably priced for a quick but good meal. They said they make all of the pita, chips and falafel fresh each day in the restaurant. They even have a little section called the bakery where you can see them doing it. I will definitely be going back soon to try out a different pita combo."}
{"text":"This is one amazing hybrid between middle eastern and a Chipotle style setup. Although I always go for the falafel bowl, I do try to mix it with different sauces and it is always a delicious, colourful, and filling falafel bowl. Also they don't mind adding a extra bit if you ask ;) ! My only suggestion would be to have a non fried option to the falafel."}
{"text":"The steak shawarma tastes more like roast beef than shawarma, and it was overloaded with tasteless toppings. I can't speak for the quality of the chicken or falafel but, based on the beef, I can't consider this a middle eastern restaurant nor a quality eatery. Since I threw away my food after about three bites (which I rarely do), I don't think it's worth trying the rest of their fare. Instead, I'll go to Mediterranean Cafe or Palmyra, both excellent middle eastern restaurants on State Street."}
{"text":"Surprisingly yummy food! Not oily or greasy. Nice and clean environment..If I was offered a sample to try the different sauces, the experience would be even better, as I can only guess what tahini tastes like."}
{"text":"Really don't want to be the bad guy who writes the bad review among many really good ones...but here I am and I really cannot bring myself to give them a 3. Maybe a 2.8 but not enough to round up. It wasn't that it was even bad it just wasn't very good. The flavors were just meh and then the sauces... sauce can make almost anything better but they were not good either. Specifically the tahini sauce which is a staple in this type of food was not good at all. I got a bowl with chicken, couscous, hummus and then picked toppings. Also tried the steak with the rice. The fries were the best thing I had and they were really good but heres the thing I dont go to middle eastern places to eat fries. I'd like to give them a better rating I just wouldn't recommend any of my friends to go there and I don't see myself ever going back so I can't. Sorry for being the bad guy, just really underwhelmed.   Side note if you sign up for the app you can get a free meal. I'd say sign up and get it free try it that way first to see if you like it."}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The falafel is my favorite and the fries were surprisingly amazing with lots of flavor! (Not just like your average chips or fries). Was worried that the hummus wouldn't be as good as sittoos or Aladdins but, for a place like this, I thought the hummus was pretty good. Love all the fresh vegetables you can get and the warm pita. Tahini, garlic and hot sauces are all great! Nice to have another healthier \"fast food\" option with vegan options!"}
{"text":"Delicious traditional Middle Eastern food!   The pocket pitas are baked fresh right in front of you and are the first thing you see when you get in line. I got mine stuffed with hummus, steak shwarma, chopped salad, sumac onions, and tahini. The pita was excellent and the cucumbers in the salad gave it a good fresh flavor.   The ingredients and flavors they put together are all authentic and true to the Middle Eastern dishes like my Lebanese grandmother makes, unlike some other Middle Eastern food chains in the area.  I will be going back and plan to make this a regular lunch destination."}
{"text":"Best shawarma and Pita outside of the holy land. Great service during our experience-- and the food is excellent. No one makes a fluffy Pita like these guys."}
{"text":"I describe this place as a Mediterranean Chipotle, but better. Simple menu, but can't go wrong with the Steak Schwarma."}
{"text":"Great find in the Independence area. The set-up reminds me of Chipotle.  My fam and I had our pre-movie dinner here. The hubby got chicken shawarma wrap and I had a couscous beef shawarma bowl! Yep, you read it right; they have couscous! We got pita for the kids---the best pita in town for my picky 6-yr. old. The menu also has vegetarian options.  Didn't get to try the chicken, but the hubs said it was good. The beef shawarma flavors were alright; I think the seasonings were developed for a more American-friendly palate.   Nevertheless, we will definitely come back next time and try the different items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is to Middle Eastern food as Qdoba is to Mexican food.   I ate a chicken shawarma (no lamb available: strike one) in a pita (no lavash available: strike two) with cucumber salad and hummus. The chicken had a nondescript curry flavor and lacked the slight char that I've come to expect from spit-grilled meat. The pita was too chewy for my taste. I didn't think there was nearly enough garlic in the hummus either.   On the positive side, everything seemed fresh enough and the chicken wasn't dry. The shop is also totally ADA accessible, which is what got me in the door in the first place. My original destination was the Mediterranean Cafe a few doors down, but they've got a giant step up to the door from the sidewalk.  It was an OK lunch for seven bucks but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love it. Clean and more place to sit. No parking tho :( Love their Hummus bowl."}
{"text":"I popped in one afternoon and ordered a falafel pita combo to go. I wasn't greeted by any of the employees and when I arrived at the counter to order two men kind of just looked at me like \"what do you want\"? It was a bit uncomfortable. One man fixed my falafel pita, and another man fixed my fries. The man who made the fries also rang me out. He was very unpleasant and acted as if I was bothering him. I honestly couldn't wait to get out of there.   The falafel pita was very good. The fries were not as good as the ones I had at a Naf Naf in MN. I know they were fresh because I watched the guy drop them in the fryer. Maybe they were overcooked? I won't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"If you are getting sick of your routines to Qdoba or Chipotle, this place is the right place to spice it up! It is definitely a fast-food type of service, but not your deep-fried type of dishes. The menu is pretty straight-forward and simple. You can either have a bowl or a pita sandwich. I personally always prefer the bowl. I think it's the best bang for your buck! I really like their yellow rice, especially with their garlic mayo sauce. The sesame sauce is okay, but definitely not my favorite. They are a little bit conservative on the sauces, so I always get two scoops instead of one. The cucumber salad and the onions add a refreshing taste to your bowl, and I highly suggest getting both! Pro-Tip: Get the bowl over the pita sandwich because the bowl comes with pita. Best of both worlds."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going here because it's quick, yet fresh. The food is delicious and they have vegan options! Don't leave without trying the pickles on your falafel! I always leave feeling stuffed and satisfied."}
{"text":"1st visit- very quiet inside for a late Saturday afternoon. Ordered a chicken shawarma. Was able to choose my toppings at the front counter, just like you do at Subway. I chose a tahini sauce, (really wanted the garlic sauce, but decided to spare those who I'd be spending the rest of the day with) cabbage slaw, pickles, onions and probably something else, i forget. I may have gone a little crazy with toppings, because I could barely taste the chicken, which for me is no big deal, I'm not a meat lover, I just love garnishes and veggies. But the pita bread was soft, puffy and delicious, yet strong enough to hold all that my eyes asked for. Need to visit again to try the lentil soup and falafels."}
{"text":"Naf Naf is healthier middle eastern fast food, done pretty authentically. In the countries located where Africa meets Asia (Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan), this meal would be considered ubiquitous street food. Delicious, delicious street food! Here you can choose whether you want your meal served in a pita (which is extra soft and fluffy) or in a bowl. This seemed very Chipotle-esque (burrito vs bowl).   The bases include, basmati rice, hummus, couscous or lettuce. The hummus was pretty creamy and not as Americanized as what is typically found in the grocery store and most restaurants. I'd give it a B+.   Then you choose a protein in the form of chicken shawarma, falafel (vegan) or steak. I ordered the falafel, which was actually some of the most authentic I've had in Cleveland. These tiny little balls of deep-fried chickpeas and spices were being dished out from the fryer continuously during my visit, which meant they were ever fresh and piping hot. I never would have expected to find these in a chain restaurant! One bite took me back to Tel Aviv. A+  You'll want to top that bad boy with some veggies: chopped salad (aka \"salat\" in many M.E. countries), purple cabbage, middle eastern pickles and or sumac onions. Naf Naf gets an A for all of these, as well, as they were traditional toppings done right. Very fresh and tasty.   Lastly, we've got the sauces, which were tahini, garlic, amba, s'khug or harissa. I got a small cup of each and the tahini was, in my opinion, the only true miss of the entire meal. I cook with sesame paste all the time and have had tahini in multiple countries, yet have never tasted any like this before. It almost tasted stale or, dare I say rancid, which was extremely unpleasant! Tahini is a staple and should not have been an issue, so, sadly, Naf Naf gets a big fat F for that. *** EDIT - see update below!  However, the rest of the sauces were awesome! The garlic (Lebanese) is always one of my favorites- creamy and mild. Naf Naf's harissa (Moroccan) was less spicy than I'm used to, but might have been my favorite of the bunch. The s'khug (Israeli) was the hottest. I'm not a huge fan of mango amba (Israeli/Indian), but sampled theirs, which tasted typical. I do like how they represented so many different regions with these accompaniments.   The \"naf fries\" were super thin shaved discs of potato, similar to some American-style cottage fries. They were perfectly salted and delicious! I dipped mine in the garlic sauce, which was an amazing combo. If you ordered a pita sandwich in the Middle East, the fries or \"chips\" would be served inside the sandwich, so you might want to try adding a few to yours, too.  Naf Naf earned a solid four stars for me. If the tahini has improved during my next visit, I'll probably bump it up to a five***. Someone open up one of these on the east side, please!  ***I've now eaten here half a dozen times and the tahini has improved! Review is officially bumped up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I already tried the place twice so far. Overall very nice place.  Rice and green salsa are very good. Here are four disappointments. The fries were undercooked both times I was there. I was not the only one who thought that, I was in a group of eight. Secondly, the Pita needs to be heated/grilled. Does not taste good the way it is. Third, I wish there were more choices like Kebabs or lamb. Lastly, for a Chipotle type of concept, it was expensive. Mine was over $13 for combo with hummus (extra charge for that)."}
{"text":"For some reason, I feel like I reviewed this place already, but apparently not. I must have mentally reviewed it. I really like Naf Naf. I first heard of it in Chicago, and was elated to hear that there was one here in Madison. (Now I remember... I wrote a review for the one in Chicago.)  One time I came in, it wasn't as busy, so I took my time asking questions. From my experiences in the busy Naf Naf of Chicago, I never got to ask what each of the sauces and sides were. The employee who was there took the time to explain everything thoroughly. I commend him for that. Most people are too annoyed to bother explaining what it is and expect me to just know what tahini is, or something like that.   I always get a ton of food when I'm here. As in, I order a normal meal, but I receive a ton of food. I usually have some regrets after finishing an entire bowl. The imminent food coma post-lunch and at the peak of the work day just doesn't pair well. Oh well, that doesn't stop me from eating here at lunch."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite fast food restaurant on State Street. I had beef shawarma bowl and it was quite tasty. The fresh vegetables provided crispy and crunchy texture, while the beef itself was grilled very nicely. The pickles added a layer of acidity to the whole rice bowl. Sauces were something interesting too, offering a touch of spiciness. I'd go again."}
{"text":"I really liked this place the first time I tried it, but unfortunately the last two times have left me really disappointed. I usually get their salad bowl with falafel (and a pita included on the side), but the last two times I visited, they were either out of pita bread or couldn't make me a salad. Now, the salad situation is totally understandable due to the recent romaine scare, but what really disappointed me was the skimpy rice bowl I had to get instead. Today it was pretty bland and a smaller portion than I thought it should be for its price. While the falafel was good (as usual) and the man working was very nice, the food itself wasn't worth the money for me. I will probably choose somewhere else to eat next time I'm on state st."}
{"text":"My work life lunch has now changed. I got a falafel bowl with fries and pita. First, the pita is the freshest pita I have ever had. The make it in front of you. The falafels are so crispy and all the bowl toppings are so fresh. I couldn't be happier to have this place added to my new lunch rotation!!"}
{"text":"Good selection for vegans and meat eaters. Pricing is reasonable and dining area is large. They have several sauces to choose from. Coke products for beverages. I tried the veggie feast for $8.95 it is a good amount of food."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place, so I went in really hoping to be blown away. I was not.  My SO and I visited about 8:30 on a Thursday night before heading to a movie.  We came here specifically because we figured it would be quick service, which it was. We actually thought they were closed, despite the blindingly bright lights they have.  One employee was cleaning the windows and doors, the other was changing the trash cans and lining them up in back so they couldn't be used.    The employees were nice enough.  The young lady helping us explained how to order and was very knowledgeable on the ingredients.  I got a chicken bowl with rice, chopped salad, sumac onions, tahini, and garlic sauce.  My SO got chicken, couscous, chopped salad, onions, and red harissa.  We ordered naf fries to share, a couple falafel to try, and some baklava.  My biggest issue is that our food was room temperature, bordering on cold.  Like if you put your leftovers in the fridge and then realized a few minutes later that you actually still wanted them.  It probably would have been pretty decent if it wasn't for that.  The fries were pretty solid, as they were prepared fresh.  My SO didn't care for the thickness of his pita.  I actually liked it.  We were both disappointed in the falafel.  They were small for the price and pretty crispy/hard.  The salted caramel baklava was good times though.  Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed.  I won't be making any special trips to visit.  But I wouldn't tell anyone not to check it out. Maybe we were just there on an off night."}
{"text":"Loved the crispy falafel and the green sauce/chutney. Others in our group got the shawarma pita or bowl and everything was delicious, hot and fresh despite us getting there an hour before close. The baklava was a great end to the meal and 4 adults and 2 kids ate for around $40. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Quick, delicious, filling (yes, for the vegetarian option too), and clean lead me to this 4 star rating.  Why not a 5?  -It's not really cheap (and they don't offer a rewards card buy 10 get one free for instance) -The freshness is debatable (hard to tell how long ago the falafel were fried when you come in) -The employees seem bored and unenthusiastic (not hating but it makes a difference in the vibe of the restaurant) -The topping options are seemingly minimal... but the sauces don't disappoint  State Street is a a great spot to grab food. It's quick, and there are options for every taste. Naf Naf is a great addition to this assortment, and it's a top choice of mine if I want something tasty downtown (and not a sit-down restaurant)."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this is the best Mediterranean food I have EVER had. I'd been to their locations in Chicago and dreamed that one day they would come to Ohio. Well that dream is now a reality! Everything on the menu is so fresh and delicious but leaves you feeling lite after you're finished eating. It doesn't weigh you down like a lot of other places out there. The staff is so friendly and I still can't get over how the food makes you \"yum\" with every bite. The falafel is out of this world, the garlic sauce is so good I want to take a bath in it and the salted Carmel baklava is the best thing I have ever eaten, like in the history of food I've had. It's sweet enough to feel like a treat but the salted Carmel...shut up, it's insanely amazing!!! I can't wait to see more locations pop up but if you've never been here....you MUST!!!"}
