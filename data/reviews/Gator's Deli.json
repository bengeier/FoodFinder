{"text":"I've driven past this place for years, finally stopped to try it. Very glad that I did. Nothing beats a freshly made breakfast! Not only was it tasty and inexpensive,  the service is amazing! I am one of those annoying picky eaters, and always want something different done. It was absolutely no problem...made to order. The man that took my order was also the cook, and I'm guessing owner. He took great pride in making sure he got it just right. I could very easily become a regular. Here is to supporting small businesses!"}
{"text":"This place is an overlooked gem!!! We are always looking for different breakfast places to try and we are so happy we tried here!!! My wife and I had the most amazing breakfast sandwich ever here today. I would recommend this for anyone that loves excellent customer service and bomb food!! The Taylor ham, egg and cheese was an explosion of perfection!!! If you want a corporate chain meal this is not the place!! We can't wait to go back and try lunch there!"}
{"text":"Favorite local deli.  Has that neighborhood /community feel. Prices are great, nice decor. Huge! tasty sandwiches and wifi so you can work.  I recommend the turkey bacon or the ruben, they have breakfast and burgers too  Say hi to Steve (owner?) He is a cool guy."}
{"text":"Amazing food and welcoming staff makes this a must try just to prepare your taste buds for there new location coming to sun valley. Little tough to get in and out but we'll worth it once you try there perfectly prepared subs. ..hero's. ..best priced breakfast in Indian trail"}
{"text":"Great subs and service!!! Definitely will be going back and soon! ! Fresh and unique tastes. Won't ever have a better experience anywhere else"}
{"text":"You could easily pass the old building it is in but dont. The 2 brothers that used to run poppyseeds broke off to open their own place and I'm so glad they did. Excellent breakfast and deli sandwiches with great service. They seem to still be getting things organized but if you want a true ny sandwich, look no further."}
{"text":"Don't let all the New York memorbeli turn you off, this place is a winner. The bread/rolls were awesome and all the sandwiches were terrific. I had read the reviews and the family and I gave it a try. Glad we did. We luckily don't live far and will be back soon. The wife had the twin towers which were 2 huge double stacked blt sandwiches. I had a pastrami Joe, my son the Cooperstown which was really a Philly pizza steak on a bagel and my daughter the meatball sub. Yum. Service was terrific. They were so nice."}
{"text":"These guys are the real deal. Steve and his brother (forget his name), have taken their love of NY classic sandwiches and made them even better!! If you want great food at great prices with owners who take pride in their food and customer service then this is the place!!"}
{"text":"Many people probably drive right by but I promise you'll want to stop in! It's absolutely a diamond in the rough and if you're looking for fancy seating it's not the place for you. But we didn't come for fine dining, we came for fine sandwiches! I knew by the menu these fellow New Yorkers knew how to make a breakfast sandwich. Since moving down here to Charlotte from upstate NY it's been hard to find a quality sandwich! Well finally we found the place! I ordered two, a ham egg and cheese on an everything bagel, and a number 30 (the Long Islander) on a sub roll! Both were awesome! I'll be back no question about it!"}
{"text":"Really fresh, very  delicious food...and fast too, really generous portions!  We'll be back... A LOT!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Exactly what my husband and I want when we think of a good deli sandwich! Every other restaurant tries to make everything so fancy now and this place focuses on great tasting meet, good customer service, and delicious favorites. Today we had a Ruben, a chili and slaw dog, and a build-your-own turkey sandwich. All extremely good! We will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Awesome Taylor pork roll egg and cheese on a loaded bagel.  Bacon egg and cheese sandwich was delicious as well.  I'll be coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! We had the Taylor ham, egg, and cheese! It was so so so delicious!! Owner was so hospitable and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We just went back and had the pork roll sandwich on a bagel and the short stack of pancakes. These were some of the best pancakes I've ever eaten. Pics included this time."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!  Make it a point to stop in,  you won't regret it.  Try the steak in the sack. The quality of the meat is better than you will get in any other sandwich shop around."}
{"text":"Wicked good, don't drive by yous guys will regret it.  Had the Reuben, very good portion of meat and great rye bread.  Had slaw and potato salad for sides both were very tasty  The staff is very friendly.  I could go on and on, but do yourself a flavor and you go get a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food. Breakfast was so good I had to come back for lunch. Owner told me he had the best Reuben in Union County, so I was sold. Totally true. Loved it. Cool little out of the way place, and totally worth finding!!"}
{"text":"I got the green monster. It was enough for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Lots of meat with a nice little bite with jalape√±os and pepper house mayo."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today.  Excellent sandwich.  Had the Long Islander.  The place was hopping.
