{"text":"Do not let the simple looking plates in the pictures fool you. I assure you the plates are bursting with flavour!

I highly recommend the Mantoo and Sambosa as entrées. The lamb and chicken are some of the juiciest, if not the juiciest, I've ever tasted! The rice has spices that are delicious.

Family owned and operated who are very nice and friendly. No point in going to Château Kebab down the street when you have this gem around.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Afghani food.  Service was excellent.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Great, 'home-cooked' style food. Really enjoyed everything we ate. The decor is not great so don't come here for the fine dining but the owners are wonderful and the staff are friendly and helpful. Also, BYOB!

Make a reservation as there isn't a lot of seating and the place is in demand in the evening. Also, don't count on a walk-in take-out order. Call ahead. When they're busy they prioritize serving the existing customers over take-out so they might turn you away. This is actually awesome as those of us who have planned ahead get treated well. Service is quick."}
{"text":"J'adore ce rrsto. Excellente cuisine afghane faite par un gentil couple. Les fils font le service. Un bon petit resto familial."}
{"text":"Delicious afghani dishes prepared with care and it shows!  The kebabs are moist and fragrant with spices like cumin and sumac.  The rice dishes are filling and well balanced flavours .  Try the \"dogh\" yogurt drink... Very refreshing!  This place is run by husband/wife duo and the service was warm and friendly.  A definite must-try and will be returning often!"}
{"text":"Greeted with a smile in this warm family (couple) run restaurant. Wonderful home cooking- fresh, with different flavours than the typical Indian or Middle Eastern foods we all have all the time. Really really tasty, nice presentation and made to order. My wife enjoyed her eggplant appetizer (me too) and we both also enjoyed the vegetarian dumpling with leek, lentils, etc...  My main dish was a lamb with rice and wife had a spinach dish. Bread was cross between pita and nan and also excellent. For those who like some spice, there were 2 side containers on each table with a hot sauce and another semi hot sauce with green herbs or something that were both very tasty. 
Fresh mint tea for $1.50 and all in all a real find which unfortunately we didn't find till today. But we will definitely be back. The server (wife) was extremely friendly, helpful and even had some humour. Husband did the cooking. Not fast food, but not slow either. To me speed was just right."}
{"text":"Great food.  Tasty, simple.   All original flavours.  
The place doesn't look like much but the taste more than makes up for it. 
I recommend it heartily."}
{"text":"This was a great place.  There is a sense of precision and elegance not always present in ethnic food.  The pumpkin or potato something or others were great and delicate, crisply crepe like with a subtle level of spicing and a touch of yogurt elegantly decorating the dish.  

The kabobs, the chicken and lamb were nicely spiced.  The pilau was very nice and delicate with touches of lamb and raisins inside of it.  Even the chicken soup was very nicely done."}
{"text":"Discovered Afghan food here; wonderful aromatic spiced dishes and warm service. Everything I had was delicious from the mantoo dumplings to the eggplant, beef kebabs and rice. BYOW is a definite +++"}
{"text":"Have  been coming here for a few years now . Food is always fresh and very tasty. It is bring your own wine. Service is good . Restaurant is small so reservations are recommended ."}
{"text":"It's a true mom and pop restaurant as previous reviewers have mentioned. It was the owner who prepared and served us. Great attention given to the preparation of the food. She even went the extra step to explain the flavours we should look for and how different meats on the menu were prepared. The chicken and lamb brochettes were marinated and well-spiced while not being spicy. Great rice for a change. Afghan bread (the first I've had) is more like bread than naan - it went particularly well with the white yoghurt-based sauce that came with the samosas. They also have warm homemade baklava.

It's located in a strip mall with distinctive colours of the Afghan flag. The combo brochette platter I took runs for $18 (tax and tip extra) so it's not the cheapest, but keep in mind BYOB. They take credit card and real receipt is issued. Overall satisfied with the food and service."}
{"text":"Fantastic small family place! 
Mantoo ( as appetizer ) were very authentic and to die for, with sauce very flavourful but not hot.
My better half took Kabul pilaw and it was delicious, while i took kebab - chicken and lamb mix combo. I have never had so tender and juicy lamb and chicken, amazing. It was sprinkled over by some spice mix which gave incredible flavour, with some warmth and no heat.
Definitely would come back!
Giving it 5 stars within this type of restaurant category."}
{"text":"Nice, quite, unpretentious restaurant that serves good Afghan food. The Sambosa's were amazing. Added bonus: BYOB. Cheap too!"}
{"text":"Great Afghani food in the DDO area! I recently discovered it for lunch with some coworkers. It has a family-run style and vibe, and I thought the woman serving us was very nice, informative when explaining the menu. She was also sweet and generous since she offered each 4 people part of our group (we were 12 people) an eggplant appetizer.

Everything was yummy and affordable. I tried the meat samboosa appetizer served with yoghurt sauce and the shish kabab main plate, that came with 1/2 rice, 1/2 salad. The rice was flavourful and aromatic.

It's a BYOB place so I can imagine this place is awesome at night. I would go back to try some of the other menu items. Great job!"}
{"text":"The main dishes was alright, but it was composed of 60% rice, 30% salad and 10% meat. Just not the best bang for your buck... From reading the reviews here, I thought this place would blow me away, but it wasn't even close to reaching my expectations.

We also got the sambosas and those were pretty good!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Well cooked and a great place to bring your date if you like to dine in. It's bring your own wine. 

Pros: Food and service were excellent in my opinion. 

Cons: Seating is limited. Therefore, call in advance and place a reservation."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. From the mantoo to start until the baklava that ended our meal it was great. Amazing service too."}
{"text":"Thought i would try this place for dinner with a few friends. This is a real mom and pop restaurant. The food is prepared by the owners and cooked fresh to order. We tried a number if different dishes. The pumpkin appetizer was very good. Much better than i would have thought. We also tried the mantoo app which were great meat dumplings with a yoghurt sauce. For the main i ordered the Kabuli palow which came with the moistest pieces of lamb. The best part was the price a large app and main for under 20$. Next time i will be sure to try the many desserts."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and helped me pick food the family would like. The food was very tasty and seasoned perfectly especially the spinach with braised lamb called for seconds."}
{"text":"I ordered the pumpkin curry served over rice, and my girlfriend ordered the lamb dish. The pumpkin was not at all what I was expecting - this dish was light and flavoured with a great mix of whatever herbs and spices used. I was really able to taste and appreciate all the flavours. The same was true for the lamb, which as other reviewers have noted simply melted in my mouth. For dessert we had the rice pudding and baklava. Both were good but nothing to rave about. 

This restaurant could be 5 stars, except the food is too homemade. The couple that runs this place are the absolute nicest hosts, and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Came to Montreal to visit some family. Being born and raised in New York, there are various Afghan restaurants and I wish this lovely place was closer to me! The couple the own the place are fantastic. The food was excellent, loved the lamb that they served. My family loved the food as well but they were in love with the bread that they served. If I am ever in the area again I will be going back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"I had more food than I could eat and all of it was as delicious as it looked. I have never had as tender filet mignon not even in high end 5 star restaurants. The entres such as the rice and dumplings are a must try. At the end of the day it was all at a very affordable price!"}
