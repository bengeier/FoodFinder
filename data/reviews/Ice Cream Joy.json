{"text":"When they first opened I wasn't sure about this place, but now I love it! I usually like weird things so, I ordered their ice creams, like the thai one, & I think too many flavors & chunks of non-traditional desert things just aren't for me. They have enough vegan flavors (at least half) that there are always a couple I do like a lot. I also finally get to eat vegan caramel sauce! I've never had fancy Starbucks drinks, but it seems like people who liked non-vegan ones could get some analogs here. The coffee & cinnamon buns are good too. They have good pop ups like, Vegan Doughnut Company & Chef Todd K. The staff is always really nice too."}
{"text":"Fantastic flavor options to go along side the wonderful customer service. Definitely a great place."}
{"text":"Got some of the salted Carmel pistachio?  Some of the best ice cream I have ever had.  Tried several other flavors which were also fantastic."}
{"text":"Fantastic flavors, activites for kids, and cool ice cream bowls to buy. Only complaint is the music, turn off the emo and play some MASTODON."}
{"text":"Love love love this little place, it's my second time visiting. It's so cool on the inside and the workers are super cool as well. They greeted us with a smile and were upbeat and pleasant while we did our taste testing. They have real little spoons to taste the ice cream which are so cute! I got the vegan vanilla/chocolate swirl with vegan caramel sauce on top and hubby got the vegan dark chocolate chip expresso. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. GREAT for vegan people, lots of flavor options. Come for brunch! Super affordable, tasty happy-dog style toast and oats, and you can get shots of espresso in your milkshake. Also, the vegan mac&cheese nights on thursday are so bomb."}
{"text":"Finally got to check out this small shop just down the street from me and wowzers talk about wacky flavors. This homegrown shop makes all of their ice creams and sorbets in house. With flavors from kale to kiwi to amaretto sugar cookie and hazelnut coffee there is options for everyone. Not only are these delicious dips of ice cream tasty but many options are vegan. While topping like caramel and hot fudge are extra there is a buffet of tasty sprinkles that are free for the taking, rainbow dinosaurs are my personal favorite. Flavors rotate fairly frequently so be sure to stop in often to sample all of the tasty varities."}
{"text":"This place is great. Inventive flavors that don't just sound good but taste good. Many options for vegetarian eaters as well. 

I sampled a bunch of ice cream but wound up getting two different scoops of sorbet. They were both amazing. Cant wait to visit again"}
{"text":"High quality due to small batch making. Fun and unique flavors. The chocolate strawberry had my tongue going crazy trying to decide which I like better the chocolate or the strawberry of the combo. One scoop wasn't enough so the white chocolate raspberry balsamic was definitely scrumptious. Lots of vegan options.  

Why not a four. Just not as creamy as I prefer but I will be back."}
{"text":"Ice cream. 
That creamy goodness that just hits the spot after a long day, and is the perfect compliment after a meal. I had only heard of this little place but not stopped in due to time and schedule. The other day, after a meal up the road, my Wife and friends and I stopped in to check it out; it was worth it. 

The folks here do up a variety of interesting flavors in both standard and vegan varieties as well as sherbets .The flavors vary from day to day, but they are all really amazing and made with quality, sustainable, local resources. I had a small scoop of a Caramel Blondie along with a vegan Sweet Potato Pecan; both were just amazing. The folks here also team up with Fear's Confections (conveniently located right next door,) so that if you buy one of Fear's amazing brownies, you can get one heated up, and then have one of Ice Cream Joy's amazing treats as a topper!

Their prices aren't bad, especially for many of the unique treats they offer, and they also offer shakes, floats (with a line of special artisan sodas,) and other great concoctions. 

There is limited street parking on site, but that shouldn't stop you. They also have a nice set up for the kids (playhouse included,) and a \"Bowl Club\" for repeat customers who want to get treats monthly. (Oh, and did I mention, similar to many local pubs, they do a \"flight\" of ice cream flavors so you can get a general sampling? Very Cool.) 

All in all, it's really a joy to visit Ice Cream Joy:)"}
{"text":"I am a picky person when it comes to ice cream and the thought of some of the funky flavors is scary! But, they each flavor I have tried does not disappoint. My favorite is the avocado vanilla, but I have also had the white chocolate balsamic flavor and wow, it is good!"}
{"text":"Staff is always so friendly here and welcoming. Their vegan flavors are all amazing and they invite you to try all the flavors. They have a great play area for the kids too!"}
{"text":"Cleveland has a number of amazing ice cream places (Mitchell's &a sweet Moses) but ice cream joy may have topped those. The flavors are all unique and all delicious. Perhaps the best thing is the free SPRINKLES!!! You add them yourself and there's a good variety. They even have a flight of ice cream so you can try them all!"}
{"text":"I had bookmarked Ice Cream Joy a while back, but just never thought I would actually be in the area to try it. However, I was going to Fear's Confections, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Ice Cream Joy was right next door!

What really stood out to me was the unique flavors that were being offered, half of which were vegan. Having just come off of a heavy lunch I was hoping for somewhat lighter flavors, but nothing necessary met the requirements. I had a sample of the Chai Pear, the Kiwi Sorbet, and the Raspberry White Chocolate Balsamic. I wasn't exactly a huge fan of any of the flavors.

I ended up getting a mini cup of the Raspberry White Chocolate Balsamic, and it was interesting. It had a decently light flavor, but texture-wise was a little strange. It was a little grainy, and the small chunks of white chocolate didn't quite help. The BF loved it though and couldn't stop eating. 

While I didn't quite have the experience I was hoping for, I would definitely come back another day when they have some of the flavors I wanted to try available! Make sure to check their website for their daily flavors."}
{"text":"I have a dairy allergy and to find such a wide variety like I can at Ice Cream Joy makes me feel so #blessed.  Where else can you get a s'mores flavor with whipped cream and caramel sauce with no dairy?!?  And it tastes amazing, AND my husband can get regular dairy flavors.  The owner is such a nice person and goes out of her way to make sure you like everything you get."}
{"text":"This place is definitely appropriately named! I was wandering about the streets of Lakewood when I spotted this gem and quickly snagged a parking spot right out front. Once inside I was warmly greeted by the friendly owner whose middle name is Joy. It turned out I was there during happy hour (2-6pm) so I got a dollar off every item I purchased! After sampling many delicious and unique flavors (there was actual chunks of Brie Cheese in one of them!) I decided to get a couple ice cream sandwiches (which if you buy in bulk you get them at a cheaper price). I went with a Bourbon flavored ice cream between two Chocolate Chip cookies, Vegan Cayenne Sweet Potato Pecan sandwiched between two Oatmeal cookies, and Berry Cheesecake between two Sugar Cookies with Sprinkles. 

OMG my mouth was so happy! But dang these babies are huge! It took me a couple sittings before I could finish off just one so I am pretty thankful each one comes in a sealed plastic pouch. My only slight nit pick would be that the cookies are hardly baked so it's like eating raw cookie dough, which after a few bites you know you're going to get an upset stomach if you don't put that thing down and eat a salad instead. 

Overall I really enjoyed the treats I got from Ice Cream Joy and I would definitely check it out again!"}
{"text":"Variety of flavors,  with vegan options though still a little too far out for me personally.  Had the bourbon coffee ice cream... Mmm mmm good. 
Likely will come back, especially as they have happy hour things going on too."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out on small business Saturday. 
Amazing!! Its in a great location in Lakewood. The owners are incredibly sweet! 
We tried a few samples. I liked the avocado and orange. But, we LOVED the chocolate cinnamon malt and ultimately took a pint of that home. It was delicious!

I also took home a bourbon ice cream cupcake. The first bite was weird. But, the flavors danced in your mouth. Awesome treat!

The shop is small. But, comfortable and perfectly decorated with local artists work and comfortable chairs. 
Vegan options are available!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! Fantastic ice cream. Great for vegans. Awesome staff. Tons of local ingredients. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ice Cream Joy is a really cool place in Lakewood. I visited recently for the first time while visiting The Vegan Donut Company pop-up shop they sometimes host.

I didn't try any of their ice cream (which looked delicious!) but did have something from their coffee menu. I ordered a latte with their housemade caramel and it was super satisfying. They also have hot chocolate (with vegan chocolate or Fear's Confections' white, milk, or dark chocolate), and tons of housemade syrups to add to your drinks, like Vanilla, Brown Sugar, Lavender Vanilla, Bourbon, and Cinnamon. They also carry Old City Soda and have affogatos (espresso with ice cream) and on-tap cold bloom coffee. The entire drink menu is super awesome. Everyone can find something they like, kids and adult alike. I can't speak too much to ambiance-- it was really packed because of the pop-up shop, and I was dying to get out of there, but it seemed very cute and cozy.

Bonus: Ice Cream Joy and Fears' Confections are neighbors! Get some ice cream or coffee, then stop at Fears' for delicious chocolates. Location, location, location! I love that they collaborate together on their menu."}
{"text":"Nice little spot. Many interesting flavors, and all were very good. IMO, a much lighter texture than a Jeni's or Mitchell's type of ice cream. The $8 flight is a little pricey but a great way to try most flavors in one go. Will definitely go back. You can buy a brownie at Fear's Confections and theyll take it over and put a scoop of ice cream on it. Needs a little more seating. Two groups of people filled the place up."}
{"text":"Local female owned business - heck yea! This is a such a gem in Lakewood with half of its ice cream offerings being vegan (and super delicious!). They are constantly showcasing new and unique flavors (i.e., white chocolate with cinnamon biscuits, sesame and seaweed), often with local collaborations, while still maintaining consistency in texture and qualify. I find that many small ice cream shops that like to experiment with flavors often don't keep up their quality. They highlight other local businesses as well from art to cold-brew coffee and even starting offering coffee in the mornings. I haven't tried out their barista skills but with my experience during dessert times, I'm sure they are yummy. Plus, they have a \"flavor passport\" rewards program and a cute ice cream truck play area for the kiddos. Perfect place for everyone!"}
{"text":"There's something about Cleveland small businesses between December 23-mid January...a lot of them close. And while I understand the need for (presumably) well-deserved time off, it's really frustrating for a potential customer to check out three local businesses (all sweets businesses /cupcakeries of sorts) to find they are ALL closed for another few days. But that's nothing to do with Ice Cream Joy, as it worked out in their favor a few days ago!

I rolled into Ice Cream Joy at 4:30pm on a particularly cold Wednesday with one thing in mind: to bring delicious treats to my brother's house (and for my little nieces). Inside, Ice Cream Joy is pretty adorable. You'll find a smattering of kid-friendly table set ups, bright walls, and a small but well-edited selection of ice creams and sorbets near the back. The selection of artisan ice creams ranged from classic to quirky and plenty of vegan options: Cinnamon Sugar, Coconut Almond Dark Chocolate, Paved Road, Roasted Black Sesame & Seaweed, Strawberry Dark Chocolate Balsamic. I sampled the coconut almond dark chocolate and the paved road and both were equally delicious. 

They have other offerings like artisan soft pretzels, ice cream muffins, and *crazy good* ice cream sandwiches. You know the ice cream sandwiches I'm talking about - the type in which the cookie is nice and soft to the point where it almost feels like eating raw cookie dough. Damn right. 

Pro tip #1: Closed Tuesdays and Thursdays
Pro tip #2: Every day from 2-6pm is ice cream happy hour where you'll score $1 off every frozen treat."}
{"text":"Interesting! Awesome staff. Great flavors! A little pricey, but well worth it! A flight is a great share between two people. I'll be interested to see how this business blossoms!"}
{"text":"The place is very small and cramped. Some of the flavors are too cooky for my liking. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The vegan ice cream is not very creamy but it is okay. My favorite is when the Vegan Donut Company does pop up shops inside!"}
{"text":"They have nothing but love for vegans . When a business makes an effort to not only have vegan options, but to also clearly label them saving me from that awkward \"is it vegan? Are you sure? Can I see the label?\" conversation, I am impressed. There were 5 or 6 vegan ice cream flavors. I tried the vanilla, and chocolate swirl. In all honesty, it was a bit icy, a quality of which many vegan vanilla based ice creams are guilty. Their homemade vegan chocolate sauce and whipped cream though, out of this world! I have searched high and low for a vegan hot fudge, and it just doesn't exist. While this was not hot fudge, it tasted just like it, minus the fact that it wasn't actually, you know, hot. It was thick like fudge. I haven't licked an ice cream bowl clean since I was a kid, but you better believe there wasn't a drop left when I was done. The whipped cream was yummy too. I will definitely be back to try more flavors as they change regularly (they seem to be good at keeping the website up to date, again, very awesomely convenient)."}
{"text":"6 stars! I SCREAM about this ice cream. Great flavor combinations! Forget dinner. Eat desert first. Pass thru to Fear's Confections is awesome."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm a sucker to support a new local business! That combined with artisan ice cream and I'm IN! 

Every time I've been here they have new flavors. These are not your run on the mill flavors either. Of Course they have vanilla-Esque flavors, but you'll also find coffee chip and strawberry balsamic and onion cheddar-you heard me right. Oddly enough, they all taste good! I know this because they let you sample any and all flavors. 

The atmosphere is super cute with your grandmas old table and chairs to sit in and make a puzzle while the kids play in the little ice cream shop. 

Love it, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A cute little ice cream spot with a lot of unique flavors. The local art gallery is awesome. The waffle cones are DEEEE-LISH! I had a chocolate and peanut butter ice cream that I thought was sort of grainy and didn't have a whole lot of peanut butter taste, but my partner had fresh strawberry ice cream and it was perfect. Service was super friendly and helpful. I don't know if we'll be back, but I will definitely recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Guys, I'm really sad about writing this review. I bookmarked Ice Cream Joy when it was featured in a Yelp email, and I was so excited to try it. I loved the idea of having a new ice cream place that had vegan choices for me, and regular options for my husband. I really, truly wanted to love it, but unfortunately, did not. 

I visited on a Thursday evening with my husband and my cousin who was visiting us from out of town. The inside was very unique and interesting, and I liked the art they had for sale. The interior was also quite small, but thankfully, it wasn't crowded that night. The 2 people working were extremely nice, and the customer service was great! They were patient and very helpful!

There were a lot of interesting flavor options that sounded good, but we all went with very safe choices. I ordered the double mini with a mini scoop of vegan chocolate chocolate chip, a mini scoop of vegan peanut butter chocolate chip, and vegan whipped cream. My (non vegan) husband ordered the vegan peanut butter chocolate chip with regular caramel sauce and regular whipped cream. My cousin had a scoop of the regular peanut butter and jelly swirl. 

As much as we wanted to, nobody really liked their ice cream. My cousin said her ice cream was bland and she couldn't really taste the peanut butter or jelly. I felt the same. My peanut butter chocolate chip had a strange, VERY light, almost powdery peanut butter taste, and it was slightly grainy. If I were at home I would have probably added peanut butter to it to make the flavor stronger, and that would have made it better. My husband agreed and said his was \"okay\", just not really good. 

We left a bit disappointed. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't what we were expecting after reading the fantastic reviews. I would probably give it another chance, and maybe try a few other things before deciding. The workers were very nice and that definitely adds to the possibility of trying it again one day."}
