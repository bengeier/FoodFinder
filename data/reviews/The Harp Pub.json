{"text":"Met a friend at The Harp Pub & Restaurant today 7/26/12 during Happy Hour 3-7pm. We asked our server what was their specials during happy hour, which he promptly explained about the beer, wine and well drinks along with \"all\" the appetizers. First issue: when the bill came there was no happy hour price for our Celtic Platter. When we asked why he said, \"oh yeah, well yeah, that one is not on the Happy Hour menu.\"  Next issue: we had the bill split between my friend and I but when he brought mine he said, \"Ooops, I sort of charged you wrong the 1st time I ran your card ($26.+) so I ran it again and that \"should\" void the 1st charge and then I ran it for the correct amount.\" I asked him for a voided transaction slip and that's when he told me about him running the card again for the $26.+ which would hopefully void out. At this point I wanted the manager aware of the issue and I also wanted confirmation that this would be cleared because if you total the amount my card was ran for it comes to over $71.00 for a $19.+ bill. All the manager, John, in all his arrogance, had to say was will it really hurt you if it takes 5 days to clear your bank. Well John...YES it will. I work damn hard for my money and I don't want someone else to tie up my money when I choose to use it. I plan to spread the word about The Harps, rude manager and his lack of understanding along with the fact that his staff obviously have not been properly trained on their system. I work in a large company in the area and I hope this information spreads and hurts them so they learn this is not the right way to run a business.  By the way...I was NOT looking for anything free or taken off my bill. The fact that the manager, John was rude and lacked understanding for the issue is what made me write this."}
{"text":"My English hubby and I were delighted to find a good British place by our house. We were not fans of Molly Brannigans so we were skeptical. To our surprise the food was really good. My husband loved the fish and chips served with haddock as it should be and the cottage pie was supper yummy. We also did the app of curry and chips - again served the proper British way. The bar had a great selection of beers including cider. It has been the best proper British food we have found in Mesa, Gilbert area. I recommend it."}
{"text":"I love this place, the fish and chips are my favorite I introduced this pub to many friends. BUT, the service is very in attentive and you feel that you are annoying them asking that the outside table be wiped or that the beer is the wrong one. I will go back , as I do like the pub atmosphere and the food, PLEASE hire better staff."}
{"text":"The Harp was the best tap beer and the liver and onions were the best I have ever had in any restaurant. This was really good."}
{"text":"We attempted to go to The Harp for St Patrick's day as we have for the past 5 years. It was very crowded as usual, so we went to put our name on a list for dinner. The gentleman at the door said that there is no list and it was open seating. We asked how we would get a table to have dinner and he said just stand by a table and wait for someone to get up or come back tomorrow. He was very rude and it was almost impossible to get a table. We left and went to The Hub bar and grill and had a delicious dinner and green beer!"}
{"text":"Went for a few Guinness and some wings on a relaxing Sunday afternoon. Not all of the wings were done, so they gave me a new full order. Servers are cordial.  Beer is fresh. Music relaxing.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Went with my parents we had a) Bangers and mash, b) Cornish pasty, and c) Corned beef and cabbage. All menu items were wonderful. The gravy on the bangers and pasty was really good. We also had a Celtic platter and the deep-fried mushrooms were awesome! Not those mushy button mushrooms in some other restaurants, these were firm and delicious. First visit, but will be definitely going back for some more."}
{"text":"Went for the World Cup. The food was good but the service was forgettable. Kinda felt forgotten about through the game drinks not refilled and didn't see the server for 20 min at a time."}
{"text":"Ah the harp *laughs* I have been here a few times and have been meaning to write a review. The first time was years ago and it was named something else they had some amazing fish and chips. The service was great and the place was hardly loud or busy.   The next time was for my birthday with my father maybe two years ago. The food was ok not great but it was maybe a three star. The service hahaha a joke the guy and my dad hit it of but he proceed to make me feel bad cause I was drinking to much water and he thought it was \"weird.\" He then went on to joke about a ren fair group there having a party that he had seen enough cleavage from a fat girl to last him a life time. Well I am not skinny it made me feel like shit, that he would say that in front of any one let alone a \" fat girl.\"   The last straw was when my friend had her birthday meet up there. We where the only ones in the front part, and a real real bad singer was playing in the back. The server took are orders brought us beer and appetizer and proceed to ignore us while he drank at the bar and went out to smoke possible weed we could smell it on him. 45 mins later after are meal orders did not come we waved him done. He forgot to put in are meal order! Instead on maybe comping the meal or drinks he offered us booze? At that time we all had two or three beers and need to drive home so declined. Which we told him why. When the food came 20 mins later it was not worth the wait. Greasy fish and chips and nasty salad. He then once again ignored us we had to wave him done for a check. And say that are food and booze were full price? That's fine but no apologies no trying to fix the bad service just ignoring us while he drank. Worse service, worse food I will never go there again how can they redeem themselves after that?"}
{"text":"I received a response from the owner from my last comments. Darren, you missed the point entirely. We didn't leave because it was loud, we left because of your rude waitstaff. Until you realize that there are more than a few people out there that feel the same way, things won't improve. We never asked that the childs tablet be turned off, we asked if it could be turned down, a reasonable request. The beer we ordered was not available, just adding to our disappointment. I have 40 years in customer service, that was really not a fun experience. Sorry, but that was my feelings."}
{"text":"This pub is now an Irish Pub. The fish n chips was heavy and oily and I could have made my sandwich better at home.  I think this is the third or fourth change for this pub. Can't understand why a place with good location, good beer and possibilities of good food keep failing. Maybe it's because the food doesn't match."}
{"text":"Been at this place for  happy hour, and it was okay. Took some extended family there for lunch on Saturday and had the worst waiter ever. Rude, slow service, and completely ignored, and it wasn't that busy.   I have been in the service industry and it was obvious this waiter was not happy with his job. We still left a 15% tip, but I will never go back. It was embarrassing and everyone was disappointed."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant based off a friend's recommendation.   Upon first arriving there is a sign that says wait to be seated. Well we did, for a few minutes. The bartender saw us standing there and ignored our presence, another employee looked at us and made no attempt to assist..So we waited to finally be seated.   I regretfully ordered the Shepard's pie. Now what made it regrettable was the meat. It looked, smelled and tasted like dog food. It was a meat and gravy mix that came straight out of a can. The meat was reminiscent of liver with a strong irony/metallic taste, I nor my fiance could not eat it.   I asked for to go boxes and when I left, quickly threw them in the closet trash can near by. I won't be returning back  On the plus side my fiance did enjoy the pretzel!"}
{"text":"We were in a party of 11, waited at our table for at least 20 minutes before the waitress ever showed up. She was pretty bad the whole night. We would easily go for 30 minutes before she would check on us. Lots of empty glasses the entire night, and they stayed on the table all night along with about half of our dirty plates.  Wrong drinks several times, forgot to put one of our food orders in, and didn't realize it until she brought everybody else's order out. Kept saying it wasn't her fault and was trying her best. In all fairness to her, i got the impression she doesnt normally serve tables. Shepherds pie was good, fish & chips was not. Long John Silvers would have been much better.   Now to the \"entertainment\". Why would you have dueling pianos in an Irish pub?  I will never understand it. And they were awful. I mean really bad. Horrible even. The only thing worse about this place than the service and entertainment was the acoustics. Before the crappy, extremely loud Elton John and Eagles covers you could barely talk across the table.  After they started you could barely hear yourself talk much less converse with the person in the next chair.   This place sucks."}
{"text":"thought I would come here again just to see if things have changed...nope, employees are still SMOKING right outside in the patio area...who the hell likes second hand smoke wafting all around your face...especially if it make you gag? If you wanna smoke, totally YOUR CHOICE, but If I need to FART, or BURP really loud, Im not gonna do it in your face to where you can hear or smell it....do me the very same SOLID...smoke somewhere else!   NOT COMING BACK....EVER"}
{"text":"I love this place, my wife and I have been here many times, including our first date and for our rehearsal dinner for our wedding. Great atmosphere,  great food."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer...don't come if your looking for a party....decent live music on the weekend...food passes the test, nothing special, but not bad either.  You come for the beer....also in the winter months it's nice to be able to sit outside.  They carry all NFL games also."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Saturday night . I'm from out of state  wasn't sure what to expect. I'll tell you what  very friendly atmosphere. The food I had was great it was beef mushroom ale pie . The beef melted in your mouth. The Waiter was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Met a friend there for a late lunch on his suggestion got there around 1:30 not busy at all, I liked the decor it looked like an Irish pub or what I;d expect one to look like as I've never been to Ireland but I liked it. As we stood there waiting to be seated I had plenty of time to look around as no one there was in any hurry to seat us, once seated we were given about 8 seconds before she asked if we know what we wanted? We asked for a minute and then she disappeared for 10! My Shepard's pie was ok not the best or the worse I've ever had, my friend said his Fish & Chips was good. Waiting for the check was an even longer process I finally went to hunt her down so we could leave, you would think at that time of day with very few people there you would get better service? Instead are server decided to use the down time to talk on her cell phone at the waitress station where I found her. Not sure if I'll return???"}
{"text":"Tonight, after seeing a friend post where she was eating, I checked the menu and I had an instant craving. My wife and I went and it seemed like a nice place. Honestly, the nice waitstaff, was about the only good thing about it. My wife and I, both had the french onion soup and it was ok, she had the Cobb salad, with the eggshells included and I had the black and blue ribeye, that I ordered medium and received it over well done. I rarely complain about food, but I felt I had to. The waitress was accommodating, but although she took off the Cobb salad, she only took $10 off the steak. So I paid over $30 plus $10 tip, on something we only could eat a part of. We left hungry and annoyed. I had better Irish food, in a bowl of lucky charms cereal!"}
{"text":"Just tried The Harp for the first time.  Good food, good service, good atmosphere! The Reuben w/ garlic fries and Magners Pear cider on tap, yum!! Corned Beef & canbbage is awesome! OMG... The creme brulee is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"The place is severely understaffed.  Even at the bar (which is cluttered with lousy video-gambling machines), it took 20 minutes before I could even flag down someone to order a drink.  Food took the better part of an hour to arrive, and was still undercooked.  And who in the heck garnishes a shepherd's pie with a slice of orange?  Most dishes are likewise paired with an unappetizing pile of steamed broccoli.  Another oddity of the place was that they were playing Christmas Carols in the bathroom.  In June.  Simply put, I've had much better service and food at other places like Fibber's."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Burgers are the best. Beer selection is great. Love the HARP. Service is good and atmosphere is fun. Wish they had live UFC and boxing nights."}
{"text":"For those who were fans of The Harp's previous incarnations - Molly Brannigans and Shakespeare's - you'll find the same pub atmosphere and pub grub.  My only complaint is the Friday afternoon that my friend and I stopped by for a couple of drinks, they seemed very under-staffed.  We had to wait for the initial drink and food order and refills had to be expressly asked for by flagging down our waiter.  The staff's friendliness made up for the wait."}
{"text":"Love the Shepard's Pie, and the Corned Beef is flavorful!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here tonight. Stood in the doorway by the wait to be seated sign.......never saw a hostess, bartender just stared at us, so we walked out."}
{"text":"If you want a place to relax and hear a live band play its cool. I went on Saturdays and each time it was a different band, one was more like 80's rock and another time it was an acoustic guitarist and he was pretty good playing a range of 90, 80s all cover songs. I enjoyed it.  He did a pretty cool rendition of Billy Jean on the guitar its a must see.The Chicken Nachos were good. Beers are big. If your a Vodka red bull drinker the Drinks are tall and strong! Service was ok could be better. They have a nice patio area where the bar opens up to so if you want a smoke you can still order drinks and enjoy the band from outside. The crowd is a little older around like 45 and up. Some 35yrs"}
{"text":"My wife and I saw this place featured on the local Mesa city channel one day and they were bragging about their fish and chips. So we decided to give it a go. We get there and are seated at a bar table we were not asked if we wanted something else. but I figured Fri. night, the place was kind of busy. I saw a table tent stating happy hour was 3-6 it was close to 6 so I asked the waitress if we still had time for HH; she stated is it 7' O clock? which I said no but your sign here says 6, she said it was wrong; I said that makes thing very confusing. My wife and I ordered bloody marys and they were horrendous. My wife couldn't even finish hers. We ordered our meals. I saw what I was to believe all you can eat fish and chips and my wife ordered soup. She was brought her soup which was a little to thick for what was supposed to be leek and potato soup.  She wasn't offered any bread or roll or crackers with her soup. My fish and chips came and they were good and when I ordered some more, all I got was fish. I was told I would have to pay extra for the chips. So I got a piece of fish in a wire basket and the paper they use bleeds onto the fish turning it red.. I asked her to bring it on another plate and she looked put out. After we paid, I asked the bald gentleman at the hostess station if he was the manager. he said he was. I asked to see a menu and was about to point to the fish and chips special before I could even get out what I was going to say. I was cut off abruptly by him saying it's all you can eat cod not all you can eat cod and chips. I was OK but it's confusing and you should have your waitresses explain that before they take the order so we know if we want more chips they are extra; He was definitely a prick about it. I just know I will not go back if that's they way they treat customers.  I hope someone from the Harp upper management reads this and takes action"}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Great food n good selection of craft . Great service we have never been disapointed."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, service was great! Had the fish and chips. Can't wait to go back and try the Sheppard's pie. Went on a Friday night with my husband and 5 year old son. Great atmosphere, and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's a fine place, good beer(Guinness, Harp, Blue Moon, Shock Top on tap) English food (deep fried fish & fries), and bar food (burgers, sandwiches) nice decor. They have outside seating on the side of the building where they serve out a window to the bar. This fills the building with cigarette smoke.  Very nice service. The bathrooms need attention at 2pm in the afternoon. It has so much potential but there is nothing really special at 2pm on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"This was your 2nd time in here. I like the atmosphere and the fish and chips I had were delicious.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"OMG....my girlfriend and I made our way up to the bar and the girl behind the bar made no effort to greet us!!! After a period of time we went out of our way to get her attention....she seemed to be irritated by that. We ordered our drinks and asked for a menu then walked off....and never came back to to check on us. Worst experience in a long time."}
{"text":"I went there this past Friday evening with 2 friends around 5:30 p.m.  We were told we'd have a 20-25 minute wait.  After we were told our table was ready the host said to wait a few minutes while they cleared the table.  We waited about 10 more minutes while this incredibly slow staff person cleared the table.   That was about another 5-7 minutes.  We finally sat down and after about 10-15 minutes, we had to go inside to find a waiter to take our order.  We ordered two plates of fish/chips, sharing one of the orders.  When it was finally brought out, another 15 minutes, we had no second place on which to share the order!  We asked for another plate and finally one of us had to go inside to find the waiter to get the plate.  He actually came up with a bowl instead of a plate, duh!  The fish was ok but nothing spectacular.  They obviously had staffing issues - lack of training, proper attire (not like they just rolled out of bed) and being attentive to customers.  We won't be back.  It's just not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"Im here now and just finished with dinner. Weve been coming here for years. Dad, brother and I always come here for the fish and chips.  I must say I love their fish and chips, but sometimes can be a hit  or miss with the batter... The cod is good its real and flaky. Oh btw I dont like cole slaw, but i like thiers. Our servers name was Jasmyn and she was good. She got what we needed and didnt bother us with chitty chats. I dont need to be served hand and foot all I want is my food and drink and she was good!  Only reason why I didnt give 5 star is because of the music. Good lawd it is super slow and sappy  \"im not the only one\" was just playing and now \"chasing cars\" is playing. They have got to change the music to something more upbeat. Im dying here haha. Seriously though try the fish and chips its good. And St Patty's is pretty awesome here."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were excellent! Service was good, and beer nice and cold! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for a fish fry.  Service was Ok but the Haddock was very tasteless and was soggy.  Crossing this place off our list of go to places."}
{"text":"Hallelujah, my faith in great restaurant experiences has been restored. It's so hard to find good places for a beer and a burger. My husband and I had lunch and ordered a bacon cheeseburger to split. Some places bring the meal on one plate and you have to do your own splitting at your table. Not here. They presented two plates with a half a burger each with pickles, lettuce, tomato and onion on the side, a nice amount of fries and a side of ranch. The burger was juicy and flavorful; the fries were crispy and well seasoned  (we ordered the garlic fries) and the service was pleasant and proficient. They didn't even charge extra for splitting a meal as many restaurants do nowadays. We will definitely be going back and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Horrible service and extremely rude waitress. This was the 3rd time we had gone to the Harp (specifically for the live music) and it is nearly impossible to get a drink (even though the times we have gone the place was virtually empty.) Good beer and decent food, but again the wait staff just killed any potential this place had. A woman working the patio last night was especially rude and very slow.   I wish that they would hire better (and more) people. Our friends who recommended this place to us because of the live bands told us \"Oh yeah, the service here is TERRIBLE and they are always really rude but we come here once in a while because sometimes the bands are good.\""}
{"text":"Worst service ever! We sat at a table on a Saturday afternoon and had two servers walk past us multiple times before we actually had to say something to get any acknowledgement. We ordered drinks, 2 waters, 2 iced teas and two mixed drinks.  After a while one water and 2 teas showed up. The ladies dining the tea had a hard time telling it was even tea and one of them had a curious floral taste to it. They were just horrible, watery and barely tea. When we told the waitress she said \"oh yeah i've heard that complaint before, we just have bad tea here\". WHAT?!? The mixed drinks were bad too.  We left without ordering anything else and went across the center to TQLA for much better drinks and service."}
{"text":"We live right by The Harp. The first time we went a few years ago, we were really displeased.  With that being said, we gave it another try a couple of months ago and it has made it into our weekly rotation. We always get the Fish and Chips and the Bacon Cheeseburger. The best part, is there is always bar seating and they have Sculpin on tap!"}
{"text":"I ate there last week for the first time because a coworker of mine goes there a lot and it was delicious the beer is really good too cannot wait to back."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give it another try, hoping they'd made an effort to improve on their food.  They haven't!"}
{"text":"Formerly Shakespear's Pub, now The Harp.  Great beer selection and not overly pricey for the beers that they have on tap.  The bar tending staff is friendly and very knowledgeable.  Has plenty of outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Oh Molly, Oh Molly, where art thou Oh Molly. We've only tried this place ponce since the closure of Molly Braniganns. Not much has changed except for poor food. The atmosphere is still about the same. You do get an English bar feel when inside, but the food has gone south. If you're out for drinks only and can take advantage of their happy hour, it might be for you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for about 3 years now. We live down the street so we're always there. Love the food(especially the fish n' chips) and the atmosphere. The patio is so nice, when the weather is good. It's a cute and cozy place.   I read reviews about service being slow and not that great......? Sorry, we must have been taking up the staff's time. We like to talk to them because all of them are awesome! They were super nice and attentive even before they got to know us. Also, I don't like being hounded by staff at a restaurant. Go to Europe and experience dining there( I know it sounds pretentious) but you actually have time to really enjoy your company and food without feeling rushed.   I recommend this place if you want a chill time. Friday nights are fun too because there is dueling pianos and the place gets busy and everyone is singing. Sometimes they have live music on Saturday nights as well."}
{"text":"I love to come here for their Haddock Fish and Chips. It's wonderful and with fries and hand chopped coleslaw you can't go wrong. Best Fish and Chips I've ever had.   Only downside is it's very noisy, it is, after all a pub so I shouldn't complain."}
{"text":"I came here with a few pals and I decided to split a salmon dish with one of them. The server was very attentive and she made sure to split the whole meal into two plates. I appreciated that!   However, the salmon was so salty and hard. The vegetables were also heavily salted. I was getting dehydrated from each bite I consumed and just gave up."}
{"text":"Always great food and service. The corned beef dinner rivals my family's. Last visit had the fish and chips which is also very good. And in this place the bartenders know how to make great drinks. Will return."}
{"text":"I came here late Sunday evening and the outdoor seating was perfect for watching the sunset with my mom. We both just had drinks so I can't comment on the food. I wish they had more cocktails to choose from basically just Martinis, Wine and Beer."}
{"text":"Oh dear. What has happened to this place? We haven't been here in about a year because it's just difficult to eat out with a toddler and it's kind of a long drive from home. We were in the area and decided to stop in for our beloved fish & chips. Not good, not good at all. I kept asking my husband why it wasn't very busy at dinner time on a Saturday night. We were sat without waiting. Our server was prompt with our drinks and order. That's probably why I'm even giving 2 stars. We both upgraded to the haddock. It came out extremely over cooked, chewy like chicken, and not flaky. Actually, the opposite of flaky and just not good. We both had chewed our way through mostly one piece each and couldn't force the other piece down. When the waitress came to check on us, we told her that the fish was overcooked. She offered to bring us each another piece (the order comes with 2 pieces each). Actually, I was full (full of overlooked fish), but since she brought us out fresh pieces I ate it anyway.  No apologies. No apologies from the manager (owner?) that brought it out and then came back to make sure it was better. We normally recommend the fish & chips to friends, however, we will not be coming back. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"We went in to watch the football game. I ended up getting the Irish pasty, and my fiancée had the potato and leek soup. We both loved the food, but what solidified the 5 star review was the service. Our server was Erica. She would always check back at the perfect time for refilling our drinks, but not to the point of being intrusive. Definitely the best service we have had at a restaurant/pub yet. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my two older brothers for a beer and some good'ol cornbeef and cabbage. First the waitress brings us a different beer because the one we want ran out? Okay we're cool...sadly here comes the food. The cornbeef was so try parts were crunchy and unappealing. The mashed potatoes were too different or not right? After informing our waitress she said there was nothing she could do about it but we could talk to the manager. Now comes Brian with his very uninvited approach (same attitude we received at the door, were I never would have guessed he was a manager?) and asks \"who's trying to get free food here?\" By this time I had forgotten about the food and he became the problem. I then told him as a business owner his approach as a \"manager\" was rude and unacceptable. He literally said \"cool\", dropped the $70 check and walked away. Blew us off. We were..im STILL in shock how people run businesses like this; they honestly dont care if their customers are happy. They dont care if they dont come back..amazing. Dont worry I never will. We paid and left. All in all..their memo here, You Get What You Pay For! Not Sorry...smh"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend of my girlfriends birthday, the drinks were okay but everything else was miserable except the company. We ordered our appetizers and dinner and the irish nachos were pretty good, but then we waited. And waited. And waited, while we waited. While we waited our waiter, bald guy with a beard (he never gave a name), was nowhere to be found and it wasn't busy maybe a quarter full. After an hour, when more people showed up, he finally showed up again and asked if we needed anything else. Yeah apparently he never put the food order in (the reason kept changing) said it would be right out as there were no orders in. Cut to half an hour later. The fish and chips were horrible. Greasy and tasteless. Will never go here again. Would much rather drive an extra 10 minutes and go to Darcy McGee's or the Thirty Lion."}
{"text":"I had a good time here and it was a Monday! I'm sure it would be a lot more fun on a weekend with a band playing...nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"This pub is great! The food is good the beer selection is large. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been coming here regularly for the past few years. Service is always good. The place is clean and the food is made from scratch, no microwaves. Love the look of the place and the beer is always cold and a great selection.   I have been to Ireland and The Harp is very authentic !   To those that rated this place so low, I challenge you to give it another chance.   Do not miss this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Kind of a cool atmosphere, good for drinking. Mediocre and slightly overpriced meals for what you get. Irish Pasty was mainly potatoes, some cabbage, little bit of cheese and small amount of corned beef (Cornish Pasty at Guad/Dobson is much better). Every other item was traditional, strip mall bar food.  I could have been in any other bar and gotten the same experience.  Basically good for booze, but not much else."}
{"text":"The Harp is a beautiful restaurant.  The interior is open and although there is a lot of dark wood it is not dark inside.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive but a little on the crude side.  It isn't uncommon to hear f-bombs, or have the staff yell across the bar to one another.  The beer selection is very good but can be spendy.  My friend had the bangers and mash.  He enjoyed the potatoes and gravy but did not care for the sausage.  Personally, I thought the sausage was fine.  The gravy was OK but it wouldn't surprise me if it was from a jar.  I had the Turkey Rachel.  At first I really liked it, but then I had a strong aftertaste of raw onion and pickle.  The 1000 island dressing with the coleslaw did not work for me.  After the first half I didn't want to eat anymore.  The fries are lightly battered and ice and crispy."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool Irish Pub. Cool atmosphere and good food. The service was OK, not very personable, but not a deal breaker.   I do wish they had a bigger selection of tap beers, but either way, this place is a good option for food and beers."}
{"text":"this place does what it was designed to do: get you drunk. which is just fine by me. located in a classier strip mall, this place is actually surprisingly large when you walk inside. decked out in the usual \"we are trying to be an irish pub but fail miserably\" decor, this place has all the guinness and harp signs on the walls that you will ever need.   service was friendly and fast and the bartendress even drew shamrocks in the foam of the guinnesses with the tap. the music act left much to be desired but the drunk cougars falling on their asses provided much entertainment. i also noted that this place shows EPL games. bonus!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick happy hour beverage. Pretty good selection of beers on tap, but only a buck off discount.  The AC worked well and they have a weekend happy hour also which is a bonus. No service issues as this place wasn't crowded during my visit and no food sampled, but it is a good place to grab a quiet date drink as their are plenty of tables both in front and in back of bar."}
{"text":"The oysters were succulent. My boyfriend enjoyed his Chicken and Lentil Pie. (It was like a stew with a flaky pot pie topping.) The mashed potatoes and gravy were good.  I was disappointed with the Salmon Sliders. The description stated they were \"salmon cakes\", which suggests  they are flaked salmon, mixed with celery, seasonings, and flour, and then formed into a salmon cake. Instead, these were just pieces of salmon covered in a thick, hard coating which was overcooked. (The coating was as thick as the meat. Blech.) The onion rings looked beautiful, but they were hard and overcooked as well.  Service was slow. My bf was out of drink for a long time on two separate occasions, something then server didn't even notice when she briefly stopped at our table. She didn't even pause long enough for us to ask for a water.  The beer selection is nice, but I personally wouldn't return here except the bf likes it."}
{"text":"Friday night - 7PM, place is half empty - clue #1.   Just wanted a quick dinner as we had to get to the airport to pick up relatives.   Decided on onion soup and a chicken curry pasty.    The onion soup was microwaved for sure!   The broth was so hot, we had to wait ten minutes to eat it.  By then, the crusty bread that was supposed to be inside was a lump of soggy paste.   The melted cheese was not browned in the oven like it should be.  it was DEFINITELY melted via the microwave - clue #2.    The pasty was not fresh.   The crush was floppy (again warmed in the microwave), and it had a hint of refrigerator taste.   I ate the inside of mine as I was starving but my husband barely touched his.  Strike - #3.   When we asked the waitress about it she said they are not made fresh every day, i.e. they are made about twice a week.  I mentioned that we expect our food to be fresh and she said she would tell someone.  She came back with the bill and there was no discount offered.  We asked her why and she disappeared.  10 minutes later, a man who we assume is the manager, stopped by with no expression of regret and just handed us the bill saying \"here you go\"!  They took 50% off of the pasty which is fine, since I had eaten some of mine, but he should have spent time with us trying to understand why we were unhappy.  We will NOT be back and I warn you that unless you want to drink in a somewhat authentic looking English pub, there are so many other choices nearby.    The place is not pricey but that is no excuse for cooking in a microwave."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that the staff there is amazing.  Everyone there just looks like they are having a good time and want you to be comfortable.  Those two elements just make for a great pub, in my humble opinion.  I organized a Christmas party there for some clients and it could not have been easier.  The manager sent over the menu choice ahead of time.  Everything is reasonably priced and some even cooked from scratch.  The Shepard's pie was complemented by everyone who tried it.  Food quality is always great.  The back room is a great place to throw a get together.  There is even a pull down screen and projector if you ever wanted to use it.    P.S.: The Magners is always cold and on tap! My kinda place.  Thanks to all the staff at Harp.  I tell everyone about the pub, rave about the food and staff, and encourage anyone to throw a party there."}
{"text":"I ordered through Grub Hub so I haven't actually been to this location.  It's right by AJ's and I've always meant to go.  For starters we had the Guinness Fondue which is Irish beer and cheese fondue served with soft pretzel sticks.  DAMN this is delicious!  The pretzel sticks are huge.  We ordered the two fish and chips meals which were good portions and delicious.  To top it off we had the bread and butter pudding which was SO GOOD.  Highly recommended.  Look forward to visiting and trying some of their beer."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's every Friday night but when we went on a Friday, a group of about 15 Scottish skirt wearing men played really loud bag-pipes at around 9pm. It was kind of cool for the first 5min but this went on for about 20min...SUPER LOUD.  Food was pretty good but both food and drinks were a bit on the expensive side.  Good place to go for happy hour - there was no wait."}
{"text":"The place looks good and the menu offers a good selection of Irish dishes. There are many excellent brews on tap including several ciders. Service was below par however. Overall, it is probably a good place to get a drink and maybe an appetizer to go along, but I wouldn't Crome specifically for a meal."}
{"text":"I like this place.  I was with the previously mentioned group of EVFN'ers. We can be a loud, obnoxious group at times and we tend to keep servers confused by playing musical chairs.  But Brandon was cool, he even handled the people hassling him about his shoes with ease. (And seriously, his shoes? Who cares?). Ashley was excellent, and pretty easy on the eyes too. Of course that shouldn't really matter, but it does...  I had the Haddock fish and chips, which was *excellent*. I wasn't sure what to do with the curry stuff that came with it but damn, anything with curry and whole chunks of garlic has got to be fabulous. I just ate it with a fork and dipped my fish in it. Whether I did that right or not, it was delightful.  A decent (though not overwhelming) beer selection. Pub-like atmosphere, good food, good service. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"First visit last night and I'll be back.   Our #evfn group had been invited to meet here this week, and there was a whole room set aside just for us. Service people Brandon and Ashley were cheerful and hopping the whole time. We tend to migrate/socialize table to table and they did an excellent job keeping up with the movement.  I had the chicken pie and a generous side salad and couldn't finish it all. And although they didn't carry my usual Strongbow, the Blackthorn cider was excellent.   I expect this stop to become a regular."}
{"text":"They have A fire place inside , and they use it . Very nice , and clean .Easy to make friends ."}
{"text":"In the past couple of years we've been back to The Harp a few times and always have had a good experience, except for one thing.  We stopped in for a late lunch on 12/20/15 and I've saved the receipt this long to remind me I had to update my review to mention how bad the mussels were.  For $12.99 we got a bowl full of clear, flavorless broth, with some onions sprinkled throughout and about 12-15 sketchy mussels.  Three or four had not been debearded, 2 weren't open, 2 empty shells, and well, it was just the worst 13 bucks I've spent on an appetizer in a long time.  The description says \"with white wine (no), onions (some), and herb liquor (what?) broth\".  The accompanying bread was cheap and barely warm.  Fibber Magees and Tim Finnegan's are way way better.  Someone from The Harp needs to go check them out.    We didn't send them back because my husband said he would eat them anyway, but after I had to pull the beards out of two I gave up.  Just no.  We also had the chicken and leek pie and the beef, mushroom, and ale pie.  Both of those are good, but the beef pie has a richer flavor.  Marci took great care of us at the bar and made a beautiful Black Velvet for me.  We'll still go back, but no way on the mussels."}
{"text":"Awesome pub with great environment and very friendly staff but please, please, please hire a good chef.  Tonight we ordered the flat bread which came to the table burnt.  Food should never be served like that.  The fish and chips are good but should be cut up in smaller portions before prepared to get the best flavoring.  The Ruben sandwiches are great.  If they can get a good  experienced chef on staff it would make a world of difference as everything else including the location and atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Nice place and great location in Dana Park. I just wish the food was as good. I had the fish n chips and they were terrible. Fish was too greasy."}
{"text":"Good enough,  maybe an off night. Had the liver and onions, what seemed like a fortress of mash potatoes and gravy (seriously hearty and good) and veggies. Good sized portions. Beer was warm which I know is served that way in Europe but here it was chilled but not quite enough. Servers could be dressed a little more 'authentic' maybe.  Not necessarily in kilts or whatever but not in a 'corona' t-shirt either. Specifically asked server to omit jalapeños from an appetizer and they came out coated in them. Server messed up the check (split between two couples) and was not very attentive overall.  Food is excellent, service was a miss this night."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my mom, who is from England.  A lot of great choices and great atmosphere.  Try the Cornish Pasty, it was great and just like mom used to make, that is if your mom is from the UK."}
{"text":"Food is authentic and very good, especially the Bangers and Mash and Liver and Onions."}
{"text":"I came here for St. Patrick's Day and I must say I have experienced better even on a very crowded St. Patrick's Day. The bartenders were on point but the food didn't look that appetizing. I pondered getting the fish and chips but they just looked soggy on other patron's plates. Now this may be due to the hordes of people on St. Patrick's Day demanding fish and chips, so I'll have to give them another try on a less crowded day. For now, it was a 2 star experience."}
{"text":"Great place first time eating here was an amazing experience. Workers were friendly. Food came out pretty fast and wasn't a hassle maneuvering in the establishment"}
{"text":"Also Meh.  I thought the ambiance was cute and had high expectations.  Tried the Guinness Fondue with pretzels and liked it even though $9.99 does seem high for what you get.  The pretzels were good.  Dip was good - a bit of spice but couldn't taste the Guinness.    My daughter and I each got a cup of potato leek soup.  It was icky.  Potato leek soup is my favorite food and I make it at home often.  This had a weird flavor though and was super peppery!  My daughter sent hers back.  I ate only because I was starving.  People we were with order the pasty and it didn't look that great though he said it was good.  Other person had a bacon cheeseburger and it actually looked amazing.  If I ever found myself at this place again I would order a burger!  Service was slow - I think there were only 2 employees doing all the stuff in restaurant and bar!"}
{"text":"This meal was AWESOME! From the unique and delicious Irish Nachos to the excellent Bangers & Mash and amazing Shepherd's Pie to one of THE BEST Reubens I have had in a long, long time, this was a wonderful meal! So delicious and tender. We will DEFINITELY come back here again. Also, the service was perfect...great advice on food choices, attentive and friendly service, and a wonderful attitude. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow. Stopped by for lunch today, ordered three entrees. Every refill, every follow-up required that I get up and search for a server, of which there were two, and they were always chatting with a lady at one table. So I finally asked one employee if that was the owner, he replied yes. I approached her and asked if she was the owner, she replied yes. I instructed her that I had to pursue the the servers for literally everything and the fact they were always conversing at her table wasn't helping. She stated she was leaving. Because of her lackadaisical attitude I asked if she even cares. She replied \"NO!\" I stated it shows and walked away. What a HUGE disappointment..."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times, the food is good, watering service is excellent. However this evening I had an unfortunate experience, and had it not been that I had been many times before, i would have walked out...thanks to, as i found out, the OWNER.  Unfortunately he was the greeter, if i dare use the word.  He was all but rude, very matter of fact, no smile, and absolutely NO greeting.  He was busy, walked away, never said, one moment please or anything.  When he came back, looked me straight in the face, stoned faced as he was, said \" how many\" i said 2, he said 20 mins, i said ok and was handed a buzzer...he walked away.     When the buzzer went off, we walked up to the desk, he reached out took buzzer and with menus walked away.    We stood there and figured he meant us to follow.  He laid menus on table and walked away.        In my opinion he is a lucky Owner, his business certainly hasn't flourished because of him.          I left with the opinion he did not like his customers.     I will probably go back, but if he is greeting...i will leave!!"}
{"text":"Good food, better beer, great service! Place is great for catching a match or grabbing dinner. Not a bar style atmosphere which I like! Recommend the fish and chips with any beer ... But Guinness is best!"}
{"text":"Thank you uber eats for letting me get this food as hot as it would be in the restaurant, i had bangers and mash, it was great, the bread pudding was great just kinda a small portion and lacking raisins, i had like 5. Otherwise delicious and will be ordering again."}
{"text":"I really just can't say enough good things about the Harp. The food is fantastic, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is great.i ordered the Shepard's pie and it was delicious. I can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Fries were good with our entrees. I ordered fish n chips which were average. Large portion gets a thumbs up. My wife ordered a cheeseburger which was tasty but the grease soaked the bottom bun making a soggy mess. We ordered fried mushrooms as an appetizer but they never came out. Waiter took that off our check. My wife ordered a second glass of wine which also never came out but was taken off our check.  The place wasn't busy just seemed understaffed. Our food took about 20 minutes.  Probably won't go back. The Black and Blue beer was great."}
{"text":"well in general it did'nt float my boat i thought the menu especially the happy hour apps were boring. They had a decent selection of beers on tap  and the dude behind the bar was very congenial, I did have a burg and fries which I thought were good but for some reason the place leaves me cold like the english weather."}
{"text":"The fish and chips here is pretty good. The other food my friends ordered looked ok for pub food for the price.  The service has always been decent; although, I have never been here during peak times. I do hear that it is standing room only on Saint Patrick's Day which is not something I would do myself.  The other bonus, are the drinks tend to be over poured.  No one complain about this - this is a *good* thing."}
{"text":"Update from this friday. Awesome band again, but really loud - conversation's just impossible anywhere after they start. I also forgot to mention that this place introduced me to pear cider, which I always will remember and thank it for. But anyway, we went for the all-you-can-eat fish fry, which once again was excellent. I also really like the fries here - better flavor than almost anywhere I've tried. I made the mistake though of skipping the fish and trying the newly-added pasty. Cheese, onion and potato in case you're interested. However, all I could see and taste was potato inside. I managed a few bites and then sat there depressed while good fish was being consumed all around me. And my conscience wouldn't let me grab it. After a bit, Ashley came by and so nicely agreed to bring me a piece of fish instead. If you read this, thank you! That saved my night. Just finished the leftovers yesterday and am already missing them ... Can't wait till fall to sit out and listen to the band ..."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service we've ever received. We rarely saw our waiter, and when we did see him..he was standing behind the wall, texting.   Food was great, for the people who got their food. Unfortunately, I didn't."}
{"text":"DUELING PIANOS!! A couple friends and I went on a Friday night and had a blast! They will play songs by request and keep the night going strong. The restaurant has a decent beer selection and what seemed like a great patio- though I never went outside. I personally got the cobb salad and it was just ok; too much cheese in my opinion! My boyfriend loved his reuben and the rest of the party seemed satisfied so I'll just chaulk it up to my bad ordering! Definitely a great find in Mesa and will be sure to spread the word!"}
{"text":"Decent price. Wish I could give it 4.5 stars. I will round up. Nice selection of beer which is very cold. Inside the Decour is very classy. Reuben sandwiches fantastic. Very clean inside and out. Kind of pricey, but you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"Not as good as Molly Brannigan's, but a decent pub none the less."}
{"text":"First time Friday tradition and we chose this place. So glad we did. Everything was so amazing! We all finished every bite and left nothing behind. We got the chicken curry pasty, the Reuben sandwich and the tomato basil soup. DELICIOUS! We will definitely be back and tell all our friends"}
{"text":"The service was so exceedingly slow that we actually had our dinner before we got our drinks, in fact before we even got our water.  The food was fine, nothing special."}
{"text":"This review is for lunch only: Arrived at 1:30pm. The place was dead. Little League baseball was on the TVs (why?). Pseudo Irish pub decor. I had the Irish pasty ($10). Service was slow (only one table of 3 in the restaurant besides me). The food took over a half hour to come out. The pasty was about half the size of a similar pasty at the Cornish Pasty Company and the crust was tough (the crimped edge was inedible). It had 1/2 inch cubes of corned beef, but the potatoes and cabbage were so over-cooked that they were just mushy paste. The only seasoning detected was the corned beef. The rest of the filling was very bland. There was a side cup of thousand island dressing which did nothing to help the flavor.   The table I was seated at was slightly sticky. The lighting was dim, but fortunately I was seated next to a window, so I was able to read while waiting for my food to show up. The server dropped off the check, but then never returned. I placed my cash in with the check and left without seeing him again."}
{"text":"What a great spot! We tried The Harp for the 1st time tonight and so happy we did. Our waiter,  I forget his name lol was very nice, attentive and had good menu recommendations. We started with the fondue and wow really good lol The grapefruit beer had just been taken off draft so I had the pear cider instead and it was light and crisp. We both had the fish and chips. Which was cooked perfectly and they have an awesome house tarter sauce that is delicious! I ended up asking for more. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The English are known for many great and wonderful things, unfortunately the culinary arts isn't one of them.  Certain Pub items are, however, a decent option for those looking for an English like ambiance to watch a  soccer game or something.  We were fans of the old Molly Brannigan's.  We were sad to see it close its doors.  We were somewhat amused when the Irish flag was taken down and replaced with a Union Jack.  We were hesitant to visit at first for fear of being there when the IRA exacted revenge.  (J/K)  We finally visited the pub and found that the ambiance and menu were very similar to Molly's.  The Fish and Chips are almost as good and very flavorful.  Some of the traditional British items, however, were downright boring and insipid.  But I blame that more on the British culture then the folks at the restaurant who are trying to breathe life into these dishes.  The Yorkshire pudding is downright comical.  Whoever created that dish should be given an award for creating the most uninspiring item since beans and rice.  All in all a decent place.  Pretty good food and a good place to gather and watch a game."}
{"text":"I would not suggest this place to anyone. I went here with a group of friends, and afterwards we all felt sick for the next day even though we had all ordered something different. On top of that, our waiter was not very interested in having us be there. We ran out of drinks, had our order taken wrong, and while we were waiting forever to get our check I went to go to the restroom and she was sitting at a table eating with one of the other waiters. And this was on a Friday at 6:30pm."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, good service, Irish foot seems Irish (but then, I've never actually BEEN to Ireland)  they have (had?) live music on Fridays.  Very Relaxing."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a good beer. Food is wonderful as well. Curry is an excellent choice if you're into that sorta thing. I personally enjoy the fish and chips though I'm bummed they took the endless option off the menu. But after talking to the waiter, the reason is understandable. Not that you could probably finish more than one, especially if you're drinking."}
{"text":"Good beer on draught and they know how to pour Guinness!  Went here recently with a group of coworkers for a holiday happy hour.  We ordered a variety of appetizers, drinks and beers.  The apps all came out hot and fresh.  The deep fried mushrooms were a hit with the others (I am not a mushroom fan) as were the wings.  Their hot wings are pretty darned good.  They are crispy and meaty and spicy! The spinach dip case with chips and pita in a little crock, served nice and warm. The pretzel with the guinness-cheese sauce was also really tasty and a nice relief on my taste buds after the wings.   Located in Dana Park, there is ample parking and not much of a crowd at 5pm, which meant prompt service for us! The servers kept up on our drinks, food and cleared plates as they became empty.  They have discounts on food and beverage during happy hour, so I'm keeping The Harp as a happy hour option."}
{"text":"Had shepherd's pie and fish n chips. Didn't blow us away but it wasn't bad either.  Not really the decor I was expecting.  I think if you're an Irish bar you should showcase Irish beers, liquors and whiskey not a martini menu and cheap vodkas or rums  (was sitting too far away to tell which but I can you tell it wasn't grey goose ). Especially when there is very limited shelf space on the back bar. They also had cheap,tacky posters put up over the beautiful stained glass.  If you're going to be in a higher end strip mall you need to keep up with the clientele that shops there,  just sayin'. We were told dueling piano night is the time to be there so we will give them another shot.  The reason for the three stars besides the decor and the ok food is there were only 2 tables besides us.  We sat to the front and close to the other tables so we would be sure to be seen but it took a good long time for the waitress to come around.  I could have robbed them blind of their alcohol and they would have never known. She was sweet and knew her stuff but we were there for probably 15 minutes before we were greeted and given menus."}
{"text":"I've been to this bar several times.  First time we were the first customers in on a rainy Friday morning.  We ordered mimosas and a pasty.  Our service was great along with the food and mimosas.  I have been to Cornish Pasty in Mesa and the pasty I had here was amazing.  It tasted very fresh and just melted in my mouth.  We weren't expecting such good food and great service since we literally were waiting at the door when they opened.  What a pleasant surprise!  The decor was also really nice.  The whole place is stone and wood, really unique and comfy.  Ladies the restroom was also clean which is a HUGE plus for me.  I've been there on a busy Friday night also and our food was again amazing-fresh and prepared perfectly.    I read some of the other reviews on here about this establishment and all I can say is that no place is perfect, I always try and give places two tries if the first time isn't super.  I would definitely encourage others to do the same.  I also commend the owner for making so many comments on the posts where customers complained.  That's really great to see.    I have been here now several times and let my friends know this is a really cool place."}
{"text":"Great bar area, I liked the authentic Irish bar setup, drinks are also excellent. They have a nice patio area, it is a bit loud for infants - small toddlers but; it is a bar so it's expected. Food is okay, service is very attentive and polite."}
{"text":"The fish and chips is so good at this place the best I have found.  Friday nights they have an all you can eat and you can also get it with garlic drys.  They are to die for.  Price is good and the atmosphere is homey."}
{"text":"I'm dating an English woman who enjoys going there for the choices of English Beer. The fish and chips meal is about an 8 to 10inch slice of breaded fish... That was definitely good food but the wait for service is ridiculesly SLOW..."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, wait staff made zero effort to make our night accommodating, the music sucked. I asked if they could put on some Irish music, being an Irish pub, and their reply was \"we don't get Irish music with our DirecTV subscription... Lame-o"}
{"text":"Service was slow (or at least the kitchen was) and when the server indicated that this \"wasn't McDonald's\" and promised food worth the wait he may have bit off more than he could chew...  The ambiance was traditional Irish pub. The food was OK. Sadly, can't offer a more enthusiastic endorsement. It's true: it wasn't McDonald's..."}
{"text":"Service was not good at the beginning but that has changed greatly. I am a big fan of the live music venue!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day.  Place was dead, which was fine with me because we got excellent service.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  I had the Cobb salad.  Crisp, fresh with lots of toppings. It was a very generous size.  I was able to take it home and have it for lunch the next day.  They have Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer! YUMMY!  Going back for lunch very soon."}
{"text":"I've been going here since 2007. Always enjoyed it and Always enjoyed their food. Had dinner here tonight and I was disappointed. The chicken curry pasty was mostly full of rice. The chicken was too tough and the spices didn't taste good at all. The mint yogurt sauce they had on the side tasted like sour cream with toothpaste mixed in it. We also ordered the shepards pie and it didn't have much flavor and was a bit runny. The side of broccoli was so over cooked which made it too mushy. For the price of the food it wasn't worth it. Needless to say We didn't finish our meals. Servers were great just not sure I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"Meh.  The décor was your typical Irish pub, the beer was cold, they had the NFL draft on TV, but what really sold this place?  A collection of twelve of the cutest blue haired ladies playing bunko in one of the main rooms.  I have nothing against cute older ladies - my grandma is one of them!  However, I'm pretty sure the last thing I expected when I hopped on my barstool was to hear a bell ringing and these older ladies shrieking every few minutes.  Most of the employees seemed more interested in their cell phones than attending to my empty glass, and the Guinness fondue was more like a fondon't.  THESE PRETZELS ARE MAKING ME THIRSTY!    Like I said, I love adorable older ladies, but I simply don't want to hear them and their shenanigans when I am trying to enjoy a relaxing night of Irish beer and the NFL draft... I cannot blame the establishment for their presence, but I'm quite certain that's the opposite image that any Irish pub wants to propagate.  SO - in this area of Mesa, there are SO many options - just don't bother with this one unless it's a Friday night - I hear their dueling pianos is quite fun."}
{"text":"Came for St. Patty for lunch. We got sherpards pue plus  Cornbeef and Cabbage. Delish. Needed some salt but pretty good for a busy resturant.  Corn beef was goodserving. I took home 2 pieces for sandwhich later on. My cohort got sherpards pie. It was a cheesy mess. Plenty of flavor though. Only down side is they didnt have any bread to make a sandwhich as cornbeef was a little dry but all and all good lunch spot. I wanna come back for some pear cider when i dont have to work."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure our food was just microwaved. It came out suspiciously fast and the crust on the pasty was rock hard like when you microwave bread."}
{"text":"Yuck! The pictures in here looked good but we had the mushroom and ale pie and Reuben sandwich. The pie was like Denny Moore and salty and the sandwich had thick cut chewy corned beef and by the second half was soggy. Soooo disappointed. The atmosphere was just as flat. Writing the review to remind myself never to come back!!"}
{"text":"I liked the restaurant .the only thing I wish they would do is marinate there liver in milk . I'm not sure if liver and onions is Irish . I know it's English because my grandma was from England . The walls in the place could use a nice makeover .  It a place I think anyone will enjoy . The prices are not to high and the service was great . I will go back because who in Arizona makes liver and onions ."}
{"text":"The food is okay (if you like Irish fare) and the draft selection is solid.  It's a great pub with lots of dark wood paneling, plenty of space, tables and bar tables.  The Irish Nachos are interesting (in a good way!) - waffle fries with cheese and corned beef, and my favorite draft is the Four Peaks Kilt Lifter.  $1 off drafts during happy hour (until 7pm)."}
{"text":"so we have been coming here for two and a half years now, and just recently we have come in around 10, 1030, and theysaid they were closing, they say rhey close at midnight. we moved and uber 15 min just to go to our old pub, but it is now not worth going. sucks because we loved this place."}
{"text":"Took the family (5) out to the Harp. We had good service and the food was very good. The wings were large and yummy. The bacon cheeseburger was large and tasted great. The children's chicken tenders were delicious my 7 year old loved them. Of course the Guinness was awesome. A little on the pricey side, however."}
{"text":"After reading reviews from other Yelpers my husband and I decided to give this place a try and we were majorly disappointed.   We started off with the Guinness Fondue which came with three pretzel sticks which were actually good, but the fondue itself tasted like canned cheese with beer poured in just before serving.   My husband ordered the Bangers and Mash which didn't seem to have been made with many fresh ingredients. The gravy was thick, gloppy and under seasoned while the sausage was bland and lackluster. The only redeeming item on the plate was the whole grain mustard mashed potatoes which were good.  I had the Fish and Chips, which I thought was going to be a safe bet considering it was listed as a house specialty. The batter on the cod was like nothing that I have ever seen before, it was rock hard and greasy on the outside and soggy and under cooked on the inside. The tartar sauce was bland, the coleslaw inedible and the fries were boring.   The service was below average. Our waitress was friendly, but visited our table as few times as possible, which was unfortunate because it was not busy and the restaurant had many staff on hand. We observed some of the staff rolling silverware, using their phones and handling money all at the same table, we also noticed a few employees walk out of the kitchen area while chewing food which we found really quite gross.   We were really disappointed and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Met up with the #evfn group here on Friday night.  The group was fun but the venue not so much.  Most of the food was good but not outstanding, and the veggies I got were burnt and so was the roll.  Service was slow and spotty.  We had to ask for things several times, and then to get stuck with a gratuity on top of it was the final straw.  Maybe next time they will get it right, but so far I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"We came in forever ago and I chose not to review at the time, I don't recall why that is. It may have been because the service was very mediocre? If that is the case, then that still holds true.   My review is mostly reflective of the staff and their kindness and patience. It is an Irish Pub, a bar and I suppose perhaps I prefer the atmosphere to the fanciness of a place.  We were there for a party this time, I was the driver and wasn't drinking and was a bit surprised at the cost of a soda and lime but hey, no big deal. They kept me pretty full all night. I did order food because I was hungry before our party started. If you're on a clean food plan like me, there isn't too much to offer. I went with the Irish Nachos. The fries were great, the toppings were alright and I wasn't dissatisfied in the least until another member of our party also ordered the Irish Nachos....  I found myself asking, why don't mine look like those? Slight inconsistency in the amount of topping (cheese specifically). Although, mine came with a side of delicious dipping sauce and my buddies did not. I also had a side of sour cream and his did not. Lucky for him I filled up quickly and was willing to share.   They were very accommodating considering the rambunctious crew I was with, even forgiving when a glass accidentally was dropped. Throughout the course of the eve they became more attentive and a bit more friendly then they were when we first got there.   Another surprising moment, an Irish joint with no scotch eggs... not that that fits in line with my food plan either, so thank you for that.   It was a pleasant night and I was glad they close up at midnight because it would have been easy for the crew to stick around for another few hours. I'm more likely to go back in then I was after the first visit. So long as I keep in mind, it is more bar/pub than anything else."}
{"text":"I'm underwhelmed by this place. The food is okay.  The service is SLOW!  Overall an okay experience, but I'd recommend going elsewhere in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Corned beef was way too salty for me. However the bangers and mash was fantastic!! Shepherd's Pie was pretty good too.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We've been here probably 4-5 times and we only come to watch the Seahawks games since we don't have cable. It is always pretty empty which used to be a concern but the food is decent. This last time we asked for our game to be put on the big TV since no one else was watching it and they did. We can bring our 14 month old and not worry about him being too rambunctious since all the games are playing. A good place to check out the game and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I will be returning to this bar. Lovely food and lovely drinks. The atmosphere is really really loud though and you can only smoke in the far back corner of the outside section if the resturant. To top that fact off they only have 1 ashtray. Strange.  The service is friendly but a little bit awkward. You can't hear the bartender over the extremely loud music and he can't hear you so you really have to yell. It makes it fun but it's also kind of silly.  Sometimes service can take some time as the place is always busy so don't go for a quick drink or anything like that.  I had a sex on the beach and a bread pudding. It was served in a giant rigatony bowl. And it was the most delicious thing I've ever had.  They have a small food menu but it has traditional Irish food.  Amazing fun place to go by yourself or with friends.  The only reason they got four stars was because I ordered drinks and a dessert and my friend ordered just drinks. We were brought the bill without asking first if we wanted it split mind you there were three people in our group but my other friend just had a soda.  The bill was handed to our male companion who was kind enough to pay the bill for me and we simply refunded him later but I still would have liked to pay and tip on my own tab.  If you're looking for a great time head here. It's phenomenal."}
{"text":"Went here to enjoy some food from the home land. Enjoyed several pints.  When I asked the waitress for a pint. She said of what.  Common this is a Irish pub. A pint only can be Guinness.  But if that's the only complaint then it was a good night.   Enjoyed some amazing bangers and mash. The sauce/gravy was    It was done perfectly. We will be back again in the future.   They had some kind of firefighter appreciation. They had the donation boot and had a band of bagpipers playing for a little while.   Best part of the night was the Broncos winning 21 to 20!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not often we get out to the East Side, but we decided to take a road trip to Globe and needed some food before we got there.  I remembered the Kierland Common like mall they were building on Val Vista and so we stopped.  We came upon The Harp and saw it fitting for the start of our trip.  Beautiful, huge space and decor was a common Irish pub, I can see this place going off at night if the crowds were right.  The food was OK.  We shared the potato skins, loaded with bacon, very good skins.  We also shared the Reuben and a side salad, basic Reuben except they cut their corned beef thick, which I like.    Overall it was very good, many drafts to choose from and we were served with a smile.  When we are on the East Side we may return, but of course others need reviewed and we like to try new things."}
{"text":"My trip to The Harp was a disappointment due to unbelievably slow food service. The waitress was very apologetic about our food taking almost an hour and a half to arrive but it certainly didn't make a very good first impression. The French onion soup was delicious, so I may give it another try. Hopefully it will end better."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice.  The food is OK.... edible.  For me I will not return.  The food lacked seasoning, and overcooked.  Not impressed.  Everyone has different tastebuds, any maybe you would enjoy it.  However, for me everything was bland and not cooked correctly.  It was also too noisy making it hard to hear anyone talking at the table."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Service is hit or miss. The chicken Caesar salad is really good. The fish n chips is a mountain of food. You won't leave hungry. Portions are plentiful and price isn't bad either. Not a quiet intimate place....this is an Irish pub."}
{"text":"The Harp is one of our Go-Tos for Pub fare or shrugging off the tension of a rough day. Stop in for a pint-o-G and a damn fine fish & chips.  Just upon entering The Harp, my day seems to get a lift. And that's saying something, and is pretty damn awesome when you are already having a great day. Maybe it's because, as I walk in, I'm imagining tall, lush, verdant-green wind-blown grass on a sea-side cliff at my back and waves crashing in my ears.  Back to reality. This a great place for a pint of Guinness and glass of Chard for your wonderful wife. Darcie and I love it. I still haven't worked my way through all the varieties of Black & Tan.  The service is always friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is relaxing. I've never been here when it's been loud such that a comfortable conversation is difficult. Granted, I have never been here on St. Patty's day; I'm sure The Harp is a raucous time at SPD.   Stephanie was our bartender/server on our latest trip. She's new. And she was friendly and awesome. It was great to meet her.  Darcie had the Mediterranean salad. Per usual, she loved it. I had the Haddock fish & chips. It was good, but I love the Cod fish & chips. So, I've tried the Haddock and I'll be sticking with the Cod from now on... it's incredible.  The burgers and wings are good here as well. The Harp is a common post-shopping-spree meal when Darcie is out with her mother (call her Old Yeller, I do). Because they are both thoughtful wonderful people they bring me a take-out order of Fish & Chips or Bacon Cheese Burger. Ah, the luxury."}
{"text":"There's is a hick-up on this story but at the end I think it was worth it. Only because of our Amazing waiter, his name is Brandon.  A new place to check out, we decided to sit at the bar, long story short a missed understanding, we talked to the manager. He made it all good for us, food Was delicious. Drinks by our waiter on point. Always taking care of us( Brandon)  overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to give The Harp a second chance last night and I'm glad I did! The food was just as amazing as before (the black and blue steak melted in my mouth and the bread pudding was heavenly). It was busier than before, but our service was perfect... from arrival to finish, our server was attentive and pleasant.  And to make up for my last experience, they picked up the tab (quality customer service at its best). I will definitely be back again and I'll bring friends!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a group of friends for dinner. Their food is delicious. I ordered the fish and chips and it's plenty of food. We also ordered drinks as well and it wasn't too bad of a price. Great place and it's nicely decorated. Love it!"}
{"text":"THE best place in the valley for fish and chips - they have the real deal either cod or haddock.  The wait staff does not mess around - beer comes quick and cold, food comes fast and hearty, and they check you out quickly.  The atmosphere is authentic and fun and all of their dishes are amazing - the pork chops are over the top served with fresh broccoli! If you are looking for fake smiles and forever service don't bother coming here.  If you want a great meal with an amazing selection of beer and drinks then this is your stop!"}
{"text":"The Harp was great!  We were there for a friend's 50th Birthday and decided to go for the dueling pianos.  The piano performance was great and very funny!  They played all the great classics and even some new songs!  In addition the food was delish! I enjoyed the fish and chips while other friends got the Irish nachos, salmon sliders and one with soup.  Everyone loved their food. We will certainly be back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices. Short beard, glasses, Bengals fan bartender has a piss poor attitude. Good at his job. About as personable as a Maricopa  county deputy.  Very superior and kind of dickish. F-U, dude. You're a representative of the bar. I don't give a damn if your day sucks, your life sucks, or someone shit on your forehead this morning. I'm paying for service and I'm not stiffing you. respect the customer, shithead."}
{"text":"Our friends and I (8-10 of us) meet twice a month for dinner & drinks. Place is loud but Christopher is a good server and takes good care of us. All of the food is good and the Guinness is as it should be. The only complaint we have is that there is absolutely NO Irish Music. None. One would think it could be piped in once in a while but we have asked repeatedly and told no- not set up for it. An Irish pub with no Irish music is a game changer. Otherwise I would rate this a 4/5 instead of a 2-3. I will exploring other venues for our future group outings. The place is usually crowded so we won't be missed probably. Is it really asking too much to ask go Irish music at an Irish pub?"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I really do. It's in a great location, there's plenty of outdoor seating...but...I just didn't like it. The food was ok. The service was...ok... Maybe a 2.5 star overall, but not a 3.  We ordered the Bruschetta Flatbread and the Pesto Chicken. Both of which weren't bad, but nothing extra special. The broccoli tasted a little fishy to me (and I don;t mean weird, I mean \"fishy\"), like they cooked it in the same water they cleaned the cod out in.   The service was ok, our server wasn't overly friendly and when we asked him for ideas or suggestions since it was our first time, all we got was a \"um yeah, everything is good here\".   Also, the food is a little pricey for what it is.  Overall, it was ok if you are in a pinch or if the line at Costa Vida next door is too long (which is why we went in)."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a pretty good place... but not awesome. If I'm in the immediate area and am in need of a place to have a beer, this would be an option. But, this place wouldn't be at the top of my list for a place to have dinner in the area. There are just too many other delicious establishments nearby that I'd rather have. Heck, I'd rather eat at a chain like Paradise or Pei Wei than The Harp.   The food was mediocre and overpriced. The service was \"meh\" as the waitress only came by when absolutely necessary. Not once did she ever come by to ask how our food was or if she could get us anything.   The patio is great and the beer selection is as well. Those are my 2 fav things about The Harp."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  It was the first time in a long that where I was completely in awe from how good the food was.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. We only came in for a quick drink and sat on their huge patio.  Id like to go back and try their food sometime, although it seems a bit large to be an Irish bar."}
{"text":"This spot is on point! I've been here frequently for the past year since I bought a home in the area. Their fish and chips have to be some of the best I've had. I love the full filet compared to most places with a few small chunks of cod. The beers are ice cold and reasonably priced. I've never had a bad experience and service is always great whether it be 1pm or 11pm, during the week or weekend, they are very attentive.   I'm shocked to see the complaints because this spot has great drinks, food, and service. I just wish they consistently stayed open until 2am consistently."}
{"text":"Fish and chips good, service was good, atmosphere good. Music was horrible. Cater to your clientele. Gangster rap and hip hop doesn't go well with an Irish pub setting. Probably employees choice?"}
{"text":"I visited this establishment today (St. Patty's day) with my co-workers during our lunch break. The waitress was rude and took forever to take our order on the patio. The food took longer than others who sat near us, in fact, once it arrived we had to box it and take it to go.To top it off, as if the experience wasn't bad enough, co co-worker had a piece of plastic from the cheese in his burger. I will never visit this place again, nor will I recommend it to others."}
{"text":"about a year go, I'd gotten a 4 pk of Murphy's from Total Wine and More and it was love at first pint, even though it was a canned pint!  The Harp serves Murphy's on draft... I didn't have a chance.  The atmosphere is great, the dark wood panelling and brick facade gives it an old pub feel, along with the mismatched chairs (I love this mismatched chairs).  Chris, our bartender, served my husband and I perfect pints and was so fun to chat with, we both considered spending the rest of the saturday there and calling our cab friend for the wheelbarrow service.    While I may be an expert on good beer, I'm no expert on fish and chips.  I pretty much am just looking for fish that's not too \"fishy\", isn't soggy, and has all around good flavor and texture and isn't dry.  I'm shocked to see so many complaints on the food, because with my fish and chips, my husbands fish sandwich and the irish nachos we had as an appetizer, I can't think of a single complaint.  The garlic fries were phenomenal- better than Red Robin since our fries weren't drenched in butter soggy.   The fish came in large portions that weren't greasy, nice and crisp, and the fish inside was what fish should be.  OH!! And the cole slaw was awesome!  Trust me- I don't even like cole slaw, neither does my husband, but we couldn't keep our forks out of it it was so good.  We (the spouse and myself) have been to many bars/pubs around the east valley, and were (before today) Murphy's Law residents.  The Harp is definitely our new spot.  I can't wait to get out of work on a friday night to check out the dueling pianos."}
{"text":"Went in with a buddy for an after work drink.  I was really looking forward to a good beer.   The beer menu offered some interesting choices, however not as expansive as I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Went so my wife could have the liver & onions and it was at best average. The beef & mushroom pie had 2 small mushrooms. The onion rings were extra extra crispy. Service was slow, which was surprising since there were a lot of empty  tables. We will most likely try again but not for the items we ordered tonight. Most likely try the fish & chips and a burger."}
{"text":"Arrived here for the first time on a Friday night, and it was the perfect night to check this place out. First off, they have an great selection of beers, including the traditional beers you'd find at an Irish Pub as well as a few surprise local craft beers. The food menu is also quite extensive, from sandwiches to fish & chips to cornish pastys. I got the Rubin Sandwich and it was great. Now the reason I said Friday is a perfect night to come is because from 9:00pm to midnight, they have a Duel Piano Night. They set up two pianos, similar to places like Big Bang Club but much small and more intimate; makes it much more fun and interactive.  So highly recommend with place for a fun Friday night out for beers and light food."}
{"text":"Sad to say I had to lower my opinion of Harp Pub a notch. Went recently and had an appetizer, the Guinness Fondue with pretzel sticks. The bread was ok, warm and not too hard or soft. But the menu describes the fondue as a \"cheese\" fondue. I am guessing it is a processed imitation cheese product, much like that sold by the gallon at Sam's Club and served on nachos at high school football game snack bars. Terrible salty pasty mixture with no discernible cheese taste. If they are going to advertise it and serve, take the time and trouble to use real cheeses and create a flavorful experience. Also had the fish and chips and was disappointed at the slipping quality. The fish (\"cod\") was fine, but the batter was leathery and not crisp. It separated from the fish when cutting it, which is usually a symptom of the fish not being dry when battered, or frozen after battering. In either case, that is a preparation issue. Hopefully the kitchen and menu will get some much needed management attention to bring the experience back in line with expectations."}
{"text":"Here we go again. I just want to tell this manager \"Bro! You've got it all and you're blowing it!!!!!\". You have this beautiful restaurant, prime location, some killer fish and chips, but you're half empty. Why? Because you could give a rats ass about your customers! Once again we were seated and forgotten about. We sat there in plain sight and were never acknowledged for over 15 (19 to be exact) minutes. Meanwhile, we watched other people who came after us get their drinks and orders in. I waved at two servers and even the manager who suddenly were overcome with blindness. The table next to us said that it took over 20 minutes to get someone to acknowledge them too when they arrived. Unacceptable!! They were nice (or crazy) enough to stick it out for the good fish and chips. I refuse to spend my money on such poor service, and honestly, fish or no fish, I cannot fathom why you are still in business. I came back after your last apology for the same shoddy service and got treated exactly the same. But this time I was not giving you part of my hard earned paycheck. I had to seek you out before we left to tell you we were leaving and why. In all fairness, you apologized, but really did not seem to care (maybe even relieved). Such a shame."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying thus place out, as it could have turned out as a hang out since we live less than a mile away. Our food was over priced for what you get. 3 apps and a kids meal was $45... not coming back."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago on a date. It was a great first date atmosphere for me on a Saturday night because of the live music. It was entertaining. We sat at the bar and got our drinks from the bar tender. At first, she was great (asking if we wanted refills when she saw our glasses were empty) but as the night went on, she got more and more distracted and less attentive. I would have blamed it on the large crowd, but there was no one ordering drinks around us and she was talking to a waiter for most of the time. I was disappointed. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars was because the live entertainment was THAT good. It was one man singing and playing his guitar. He sang a lot of songs the crowd knew (90s alternative mostly) and was really good at it. I was impressed by him, for sure."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place when it was Molly Brannigans, and enjoyed the great service. The food was well priced, and the place was always fairly busy.   When it changed to Shakespeare's I was curious and stopped in. To my dismay the food was more expensive, and the service was lacking. I ordered my usual (fish and chips, and a couple bears) and was happy with the food, and not so happy with the price.   Fast forward to tonight, Me and my Fiance decided to try it again, as we had a event that called for some celebration. We walk in to see a white piece of paper with \"Bathrooms for Customers Only\" sign on the nice door.   We then entered at waited at the hostess stand for a good 7-10 minutes. The bar tender seen us, but ignored us and was more interested in talking to two women at the bar. Finally a hostess/waitress sat us.   We waited another ten minutes or so and I observed that she was the only waitress working, and she also had about 5-6 other tables (with parties of 2 or 4) to attend to. In addition she was the hostess.   I asked her if she was the only waitress working, and she confirmed. We then thanked her, and stated we would go elsewhere.   I guess the important lesson here is that in a \"down economy\" raising prices on the same food that was available at the same place, just with a different name, and skimping on customer service is a bad decision when your best menu items are priced moderately. If I go to a place to eat, and the meal it going to run me upwards of 45-50 dollars, I expect service to match. Once again I was sorely disappointed given the past great experiences I have had when it was Mollys. I will not attempt to eat here again, there are places that value their customers, and are more eager to deliver a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!! Staff is so awesome!!!! Extremely friendly. Awesome beer selection and good whiskey selection too! Food is really good!!! Burgers are big and juicy, Irish nachos are a good starter and the shepards pie is delicious!!!! Good prices, good music, big patio, good people, just all around an awesome place!!!!!"}
{"text":"You would think with as much as I go here I would give it a better rating. I go here for lunch a couple times a month. Decent value for the money. I often have the half cobb salad with grilled chicken. Half is always enough! Oh.. and a coors light draft of course."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE  . Come so often they can almost guess what we'll have before ordering. Food is always great. Will adapt food to diet. Very good prices."}
{"text":"I'll be honest and say that I'm not well versed on Fish and Chips as some fish and chips lovers might be, though I did grow up fishing and eating what we caught in Florida. I do love fish, but we usually grilled it instead of frying it. But I so enjoy a nice piece of white fish, battered and fried every now and then.       The Harp is about the only place near my home that makes it nice and crispy. You can chose COD or Haddock. I prefer the better flavor and texture of the Haddock when I can find it. The Pub Fries are in my Top 5 World Wide. There are fantastic. If they weren't so bad for me, I'd probably eat them once a week at a minimum. So only on special occasions.      There are lots of other wonderful items on the menu like the Spinach Artichoke Dip. The best I've ever had. Lots of Spinach and Artichoke compared to most places that only add a little and stick you with more of the cream sauce and less of the good for you, flavorful stuff to compensate for the quilt.      If you can't get what you want from a Pub anywhere else, give The Harp a try. Simple Pub food done properly."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my fave places. The food is always good. Burgers are cooked perfect. And the fries... Amazing! Service is good, especially Josh. He's is awesome. Seriously, every restaurant needs him. The Bangers and Mash is delish. Especially the mash, with the mustard in it."}
{"text":"A must visit for a taste of curry and chips. We spent a great time with friends and family one evening and loved everything about the place. We stuck with nibbles and beer and it was fantastic. The curry and chips were addictive and the beer was brought quickly and often - what is not to like about that ! The staff was a hoot and had plenty of personality to handle the group of ruffians they were waiting on. I had a great time and will be back."}
{"text":"Preparing for an upcoming trip to Ireland, I decided to stop by a pub for lunch - and Shakespeare's is the closest one I know. I have driven past it before, but never stopped. Just past noon on a Saturday it was mostly empty. The host gave me my choice of bar, low top or high top. I selected the high top and was escorted to the back room, alone and in the somewhat dimly lit corner. Just to my liking!  The waiter kept calling my \"boss\", which I liked and accepted as recognition of my powerful appearance rather than the sarcastic method of calling a bald person \"curly\" or a short person \"stretch\"...  I started with a nice, cold Smithwick's ale. I ordered the cod fish and chips with mushy peas - and to my surprise it arrived very quickly. The meal included fries and two pieces of fish. The first piece was a good size and very tasty - crisp outside, tender and flaky inside. Looking down at the second piece - holy cow! Grabbing it I felt as if I just reeled in a whooper on the Bass Masters Tour. That baby was 13\" long - and I know what 13\" looks like...I wear a 13\" shoe...look at the size of the fish compared to the large pint glass in the photo. Impressive!  Needless to say, I couldn't finish the second piece of fish and left half of the fries. The restaurant was nice and quiet in the back, but I am sure it fills up when bands are there, karaoke and maybe trivia night - but for a quiet Saturday where one is looking for dimly lit solitude and a nice ale, this did the job."}
{"text":"Molly Brannigans, Shakespeare's Pub, and recently The Harp.  Same layout, same high prices, just never satisfying.  I don't think either the UK or Irish theme is working at this location, not sure why but the place just doesn't have any energy.  The food is heavy and the drinks are ok but overpriced.  I'm not sure what would work - perhaps a completely new makeover. A high end sports bar would be a welcome departure."}
{"text":"My good friend of mine took me here for my birthday for a drink. Although they close at 1 am. They let us stay because they saw we were having a good time catching up. Pretty decent prices. Love the atmosphere. Will return"}
{"text":"Really disappointed about this place.  My girlfriend and I were looking forward to this restaurant mainly because they sell Scottish (Celtic) eggs and it's close to where I live. However, let me say that this was the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. After we ordered our food, I mentioned to the server the yelp discount and he just said \"ok\", and that was the last we saw of him. Some else brought out our food which wasn't nearly as great as the previous reviews claimed.  We waited over 30 minutes after we had finished eating and just wanted the bill. He would occasionally look in our direction and then walk away. We watched a table of 4 come in after us, get their food and check and left before us. We finally flagged over a waitress to at least get our check. We complained how bad our server was and she didn't have anything nice to say about that particular server either.  It was truly a disappointing experience. Probably never go back there again."}
{"text":"If I were just rating this restaurant on the food, it definitely deserves a 5.  There is no doubt about that.  We loved the shepherd's pie and the fish and chips.  The restaurant is gorgeous too.  Lots of things in its favor.  The downside is the servers.  It wasn't packed but the servers were in the back talking and chatting.  It took a while to get served.  Even when we were waiting for our bill, we discovered the two servers were back on the phones and chatting again."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of getting food poisoning at this joint.  When my friend called to tell the manager all she got back was nobody else got sick.  We weren't calling to let him know so we could get a refund we just wanted them to know so maybe they can keep from getting anyone else sick.  The manager obviously doesn't care if he gets his patrons sick.  Diner beware."}
{"text":"Amazing local place! So just moved right next to Dana park and looking for a casual place to grab a beer. Huge bar with tons of seating and big open area for groups and families.   Pretty impressed with the cocktail and draft choices they had as well. As a former bartender/server for over a decade, I really appreciate a clean bar with fair prices and friendly service. They checked all 3 boxes there.   My brothers and I love Irish pubs, so this will be a frequent destination for us."}
{"text":"Bad food and slow service. It was a Friday night and the wife and I felt like some pub food. It should have been really busy at dinner time, but the wait staff to customer ratio was very high. Waited 10 minutes before anyone came by to take drink orders, so we asked to order right away, I tried the reuben sliders and my wife the shephard's pie. The meat in the Reuben was decent, but the swiss had been heated to the point of being rubbery. My meal was also served with coleslaw, which seemed to be nothing more than cabbage and mayo. My wife's shephard's pie was a molten mass of instant potatoes, overcooked hamburger and store bought gravy. It looked like a horrid brown gruel once the ingredients were mixed. The only redeeming qualities I noticed were a decent Irish bar aesthetic and an apprpriate drink selection for this motif. The only ways I could force myself to return would be to meet friends there for drinks on St. Patrick's day."}
{"text":"Second time there for lunch, a few years since the last time. Same experience. One guy serving who mostly was in the back room. Friendly and polite but not \"there\" often enough to give good service. Food so-so, nothing special.  The place looks worn and not in a charming way. In an \"about to fall apart\" way. Not one bit of Irish music playing--ok you cannot have it 24/7 but the 60s stuff was all we heard. And WAY too loud for us to talk to each other. It should be BACKGROUND music at lunchtime! So now we have given it another chance and that will be the last chance. Too many other places with much better service and a more comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"DO NOT get me started on this place because I will NEVER stop talking about it. Man alive that fish and chips are the second best I have ever had. The first best is a Pub in Las Vegas that is incredible, but The Harp is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks, nice place to chill. Very relaxed atmosphere. Great food, good bartenders and friendly crowd. I've become quite the regular."}
{"text":"I waited until second visit to review. Both times the food was good and staff was pretty good. I really enjoyed the Fish and Chips All you can eat on Friday. The wife loved the garlic fries. A enjoyable experience both times with zero negatives. Will be going back for more."}
{"text":"Had great service and the Cornish Pasty was great. Also had the Samosas for and appetizer....delicious!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE - EXTREMELY RUDE MANAGER/OWNER. ASKED TO LEAVE UPON PAYING....  My husband and I and a group of 4 friends decided to go here for St. Patty's Day.  We arrived early to get a table and avoid the crowd.  We ordered drinks and dinner bringing our bill to over $200.  As soon as we paid our bill our waiter asked us to leave.  We were shocked, as we had hoped to hang out, have more drinks and enjoy the band.  We asked to speak to the manager.  The manager, who is also one of the owners, was ruder than the waiter.  He told us he needed the table.  After spending so much money we could not believe the service we were getting.  I would NOT recommend this to anyone.  I have never been asked to leave a restaurant I was still spending money at.  The purpose of getting there early on St. Patty's was to get a table and hang out.  I will never go back!"}
{"text":"First time here and we both loved it.  The decor seems very authentic.  We were quickly seated and waited on by Stephanie.  She did an excellent job of making sure we had everything we needed. My wife had a Chardonnay and I had a Guinness.  We split a reuben sandwich and fries.  The corned beef was very tender... prepared just right and sliced thin.  We've had it elsewhere and it was very chewy.  Can't wait to return and try some other dishes.  So many sounded very good.  We would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is not bad if you're a fan of traditional English fare, which I'm not, but I was hungry and it was open and nearby. We sat outside on the patio which was fabulous.  Our waiter was nice and prompt. The drinks were not on the menu, but I ordered a chocolate milk and my roomie ordered a Dr. Pepper. There also was no dessert on the menu.  Their price point is right around $10 and I was looking for a $5 meal. Ah! Well, it was open and nearby. Haha  So I ended up getting the cheddar cheese, onion and mashed potatoe cornish pasty and my roommate ordered the chicken pie with the Bubble and Squeek which is potatoes, cabbage and onions.  My cornish pasty was DELICIOUS, the crust was perfect, the cheesy was a melted goodness, and mashed potatoes were yummy. MMM mm MM  Our meals were a bit on the heavy side, my roommate brought half of hers home in fact.  Anyway, good English meal if you like that sort of thing. No complaints."}
{"text":"After seeing the menu and the delicious pics of fried fish and fries I was excited to check out this place!   Disappointment.  The fish and fries had little flavor and were soggy.  Not the crispy flavor I expected.  The corn beef was tough, brown and hard to even pull apart.  The cabbage and mashed potatoes were bland.   The coleslaw and bread pudding was good.  Disgrace to Irishmen!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time and we were SO disappointed!!  We were there for 40 minuets, got 1 beer and never received the appetizer we ordered. I understand they were busy but to not even be checked on until we were fed up and leaving is ridiculous. Unfortunately, first impression are everything for us, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great design,  wrap around patio seating.  Delicious food and amazing staff! Nightly Happy Hour includes beverages and appetizers."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to eat here and I will definitely be back! Our food was great, the service was fast, prices were good. All-around great experience!"}
{"text":"Just to start off nice atmosphere inside and out, that's what drew us to the place. We didn't check yelp before, but we should have! 3 stars...I know this place isn't vegetarian friendly, obviously, but when I ordered the grilled cheese (without bacon) and the tomato soup....tomato soup shouldn't have a piece of meat in it...honestly it wasn't very good at all. I could go home and make a killer grilled cheese myself and a heat up a can of tomato soup and it would have tasted better than what we got. I'm a believer in, if you put something on your menu then it should be good at least, not just edible. There was nothing special about it. When I mentioned the piece of meat in the soup to the waitress she didn't even say sorry just said \"okay\" or offer a replacement but I asked for fries instead. Fries were alright, but I wanted a grilled cheese and tomato soup damnit! Lol. How does a piece of meat get into a tomato soup? Anyway...my boyfriend wanted to talk to the manger about the soup because I really didn't care for my meal and it was taken off the bill, which was very nice of him and he apologized. I appreciate that. He also confirmed its a vegetable base. He seemed to have knowledge of the piece of meat already, which seemed suspect haha. My boyfriend said the beer he got was alright, but seemed kind of flat. He also didn't care much for the grilled cheese or soup. It looked good, just didn't taste good. And I had to flag down our waitress for the check. So I'm sure there are other things good on the menu, but a piece of meat in a tomato soup. What's going on back there?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour on a Thursday night.  Bartender was rude so we left. Everytthing we read said they have a great Happy Hour.  Maybe they are getting a bit snooty.  Too may other spots to waste time on this one."}
{"text":"I don't know how the food could get any worse without the health department closing them down."}
{"text":"To cap off a night in the east valley (what the hell is wrong with me?) we stopped at Shakespeare's.   The first thing I noticed is the obviously Irish motif. Celtic writing on the walls, mostly Irish feel, and even some Irish specialties on the menu. The restaurant, however, is supposed to be an English pub???? I understand this is the old Molly Brennigan's and they bought it, so I ask why not either keep it an Irish pub, or if you want an English Pub, remodel it?  Anyway, they had one guy working, and the place was full of soda drinking, apparently underage mormon girls singing bad disney songs on karaoke. I wanted to leave but my friend who lived in the area said it was the only choice around. Ok, I'll stick it out, we can make it fun.   When after the first round, we didn't see the bartender for upwards of 20 minutes, we took it upon ourselves to grab our own beers, and got our money out and still planned on paying the $4 per beer AND leaving him a tip just to keep him happy. He must have seen us during his karaoke escapades because he ran over and told us to leave. I reminded him (I was sober) that I told him I'd get my own beer if he didn't come back and he politely said ok. I didn't know it was illegal and I took him seriously when he said it was fine. Oh well, this place is bad service and a confused identity. Teach me to go out in Mesa, right?"}
{"text":"This place is one I've been frequenting lately. The beer is good, the bartenders are attentive. If you are a smoker you will enjoy the patio, as there are windows that the bartenders can open up to serve you while you smoke. I'll have to order some food next time and see how that is.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. I got here for lunch. Service is fast and friendly. Love it"}
{"text":"Best place to get Irish food. Fish n chips are fantastic, shepard's pie is my personal favorite, and the bread pudding makes me melt. It's ridiculous. I have a few servers I absolutely love getting because they remember me and make it a point to make conversation. The only issue I've ever faced that makes it a little less than 5 stars is occasionally you wait a bit too long for service. Which, when you're acting as host, server, food runner, bar-tender, and busser is understandable.  And for people complaining violently about service, it's a pub, chill out."}
{"text":"I will start this by saying I have not actually ever been to an English Pub - but I have been out to eat pretty much everywhere!  I took my Gram and 2 daughters here for some lunch on a Wednesday.  The awesome: *the bar is beautiful and the decore is really cool.  Neat mismatched chairs, tables and benches.   *the food!  We shared a Mediterranean salad and Braised Beef & Ale with bubble & squeak, one daughter had the mashed taters & gravy and the other had a cheeseburger & fries.  The fries were SO good!  I cannot wait to go back and order the fish & chips.  I can only imagine how delish they would be.  The braised beef was beyond good and my daughter raved about the mashed potatoes (apparently they were the best she has ever had, period.)  The salad was large and the grilled chicken was flavorful. *the price!  We got out of there for under $30!  nice! *the server was super friendly and wonderful.  Not too chatty but enough to be friendly and establish rapport quickly. *the water - sounds silly, I know.  But my Gram commented on how you could tell it was filtered and not plain ol' nasty AZ tap water.  If it makes Gram happy - I'm happy.  The OK: Took awhile for the food to come out - but it was totally worth it!  I cant wait to bring hubby back to meet up some friends for drinks & food!  What a great, casual hang out!"}
{"text":"Stereotypical Irish pub decor. Sub par food. I should have known better when we walked up and sign out front advertised it as a \"pokestop\""}
{"text":"First time here for a business lunch. I didn't spend a lot of time studying the menu. Settled on their bangers and mash although I really thought bangers were more English than Irish.  Thankfully I asked for the smaller portion size. This was too rich for my palate. The sausage casings were tough. The sausage filling was greasy. Yeah, I know, I ordered sausages so what was I really expecting? I'd likely been better off with corned beef.  I'm thinking this place is more for groups wanting good, cold beers in a comfortable place to enjoy a happy hour or a weekend day/night away from the stresses of work."}
{"text":"Tonight EVFN (East Valley Friday Night) was held here and I have to say... I had some really good liver and onions.   The liver was thinner than I'm used to but I really enjoyed it.   The yorkshire pudding was good and the waiter recommended a side of rice that was really good.  I had a taste of their Cottage Pie and it was good too.   I love different types of food and this is nice place to sit have a few beers and just chill.    Oh our waiter Brandon, Rocked!  He apologized for the delay and not getting to us right away but he was wonderful. I recommend this place if you are looking for something out of the ordinary for Phoenix and surrounding areas."}
{"text":"We visited Harp for the first time tonight and we enjoyed it.    It is a Wednesday so, it was pretty quiet.  My wife had a burger and we thought is was OK at best.  It tasted almost like ti was precooked and reheated.  I had the shepherd's pie and it was very good.  The service was good; the value was ok.  We will likely try it again at another time."}
{"text":"The negative reviews here slay me. This is the best Irish you're going to find in Phoenix. My wife IS English. She really knows English and Irish. She'd give this place 10 stars if she could. I would too. For authentic, consistent and well prepared food, give it a try. You won't be disappointed.  PS:  We've been there so many times I've lost count. Service is ALWAYS good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Anything you order from the menu is flavorful and very good food! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic English food! :)"}
{"text":"Ugh. This is a nice restaurant, in a good location with decent food... BUT The Host/Food runner absolutely ruined the experience for my group. When we walked in to a semi busy night last night he told us he couldn't seat of party of 8 at all. Strange because I've never heard a host flat out say you couldn't be seated. He didn't even give a wait time just flat out said no. A very nice other employee from England came over and immediately got a table ready and was extremely helpful. Then that same host/food runner yelled at us for not speaking fast enough as he was handing out our food. We were all in a good mood and trying to enjoy the night and this kid was hell bent on being rude!  I even over heard him yell at a elderly woman! Please managers of this establishment put him really far away from costumers. He really seems to hate everyone."}
{"text":"We enjoy the new look and love the smoked wings and the pretzel plate. Truly can't go wrong with anything at this place. Service is always great if your seated at the bar but we seem to struggle with getting the same service if your at a booth or even the high top behind the bar. It's just hit or miss but still worth enjoying their happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time.  Lunch at 1 pm.  Place was 2/3 full.  Service was fine.  Fish and chips was delicious as were the accompaniments.  Although they no longer have Boddington's Pub Ale on draft, I did have a draft Guinness.  Life was good today!  I'll be back.   Also, all of a sudden a barbershop quartet sitting at one of the tables, burst into song.  Nice!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the first time a few months back to see The Insomniacs perform.  Service was less than desirable but the place was busy so I let it pass.  The 14oz. beers they call \"Pints\" were also a little disheartening when I got the bill & discovered how much I was paying for them.   Decided to give it another try last week & was even more disapointed than on the 1st visit.  We sat down at a table and ordered drinks with the lunch special cottage pie.  The place was almost empty and the service was still terrible!  Never saw our server again! We decided to move to the bar for better service, which was much better.  Despite better service at the bar, our food took 45min. to arrive, and arrived cold.   I asked to speak to a manager the bartender identified as Sean.  As you might guess he never came by.  He did however walk by a few times giving us strange looks?  The bartender said he was also cooking/busy & that he wasn't very good at it.  OK!  The place gets 2 Stars for the nice ambiance and a good beer selection, even if the glasses are only 14oz.   They obviously put ALOT of money into building the place. How about the food, service & a REAL pint of beer?  We live fairly close to Shakespears & might come more often if they got on their game."}
{"text":"OMG so delicious. A little spendy but well worth it! I had a beef stew topped with puff pastry and mashed potatoes. Every bite tasted homemade, rich, and flavorful. My dad had the Beef Pot Pie (that's not the name, I forgot it). It was also very good and tasted homemade. We finished our meal with the bread pudding that is made to order!! It was pure bliss on a plate!! I love this place and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Darren, I appreciate you reaching out but it wasn't busy at all. We're not unreasonable people and understand when a place is busy service is slightly slower however that was not the case. There was maybe 5 tables in the whole restaurant with people at them."}
{"text":"The food brings me back to my childhood. Especially the bangers and mash and the Shepard's pie! The service is usually pretty good too! Everything I've tried has been good. The pasties are very good. I like the potato leek soup too. I never can eat an entire portion so I'm always having leftovers. Great food!"}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the fish and chips, and it was spectacular.  I ordered the cod, and instead of several pieces, it came in one HUGE piece.  The fries were lightly battered and really good.  My son ordered the Harp Burger, and said it was super good.  We did order the pretzels with Guinness cheese fondue - ohmygosh, the pretzels were perfect and the fondue was delicious.  For dessert, I had the creme brulee, which is decidedly not Irish, but it's my favorite dessert.  It was perfectly caramelized on top, and the custard was rich and full of vanilla flavor.  Service was very good, no complaints.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I went here last night for a drink with a few coworkers. It was alright, nothing terribly outstanding, but it was decent. I had an (overpriced) Sam Adams and a burger (that was freakin' heavenly, might i add). I should add that although it was a bit overpriced, the portions were large, so you do get what you pay for. The service was okay, our food got to us fairly quickly, and the bartender was friendly enough. The pub stayed open later than normal for us, until about 10:30. I would probably go back, but i'm not overly impressed."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Changed tables and not sure if it was just busy or they don't really have set tables, but waitress didn't come around for at least 20 min. and there is a waiter that has been there for awhile that always looks like he wants to fight. He didn't stop to ask if we needed anything for at least 20 min after walking by several times. We have been in several times, and there always seems to be a problem. On a positive note, they did give us $5 off for 1/3 of our mussels being closed up. If you know it's going to be a busy day with USA soccer, you should put more staff on. Won't be going back :("}
{"text":"I am giving them 4 stars for their fish and chips.  I ordered the cod.  Huge portions!  I am a fish and chips snob.  I have to try them everywhere I go.  My ideal fish and chips is the London version which is very hard to find in our area.  This is as close as I have come."}
{"text":"Seated and greeted quickly. Drinks take a big to long for my taste but the end result is the same. The Irish nachos we ehhh? At best, the cheese was almost cold when it got to our table, plus side chipolte dipping sauce is amazing, regardless of the vehicle it takes to consume. The bangers and mash we're mediocre, no real mouth feel, soft potatoes, weak sausage and limp onions, eck!! The servers are all dressed like college students, which is weird for the complex and location, they're taking casual Irish to a whole new level.. I'll be back because they make the best Guinness drinks around, but I may just write my review after the cocktails next time. Oh btw, way over priced!!"}
{"text":"A group of us went into to have one final drink to toast a friends birthday, each having one drink at the bar.  Once we received the bill, we noticed a 10.50 service charge.  When we asked the bar tender why, he got defensive and threw menu at us which had their policy of 6 or greater getting a service charge. I have seen these types of charges for tables of people where multiple people must work to properly serve the patrons but never when a bar tender has to do less the 10 minutes to serve a group standing at the bar a drink.  The manager did fix the problem ultimately but still don't know why this is a policy not presented properly to those standing around the bar."}
{"text":"Outstanding fish fry and great draft options!! I will definitely be back! Do yourself a favor and give this place a try! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"I love me some Irish Pubs!  But $9.99 for 3 pretzel sticks and some cheese?!?!?  Don't get me wrong the Guinness cheese dip was pretty awesome but I think their prices are a bit steep.  It was almost worth it during happy hour when appetizers are $2 off.    But the beer was perfectly poured and they have a great selection of Irish beer on tap.  I'll go back, but only during happy hour."}
