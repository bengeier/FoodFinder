{"text":"This place is amazing for fast food mexican,
authentic taste, good portions & daily value menu is really great! Amazing salsa bar inside for fast food mexican, not as watered down as other joints.
It would be 5 stars if the night staff wasn't so terrible! They will over charge if you're not careful. Beware!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. For my meal I got a carne asada chimichanga and shrimp chiveche. It was so good. Definitely will come back again. The guy at the counter who served us was very nice as well."}
{"text":"They very helpful and very friendly....went twice in one day ...both time employees were very friendly...best burrito I have eaten in a while!!!"}
{"text":"This is really a one star review.  Seriously subpar Mexican food combined with abysmal customer service.  Save yourself the trouble and get a bacon dog from circle K, fail!"}
{"text":"A group of 10 had a late dinner. I had the Caldo de Rez ( Short rib and vegetable soup)
Was delicious . Orders were filled relatively quick. Others in Party had Burritos. Tacos, Enchiladas, and Shrimp Cocktail. The entire group looked to be very pleased with orders.

Pricing seemed to be reasonable for servings.

Person taking orders was very helpful in explaining questions of items on menu. All tables were very clean and would definitely go back. 

Nice selection of Mexican Food."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know what the food is like because we were ignored for 15 minutes and my 3 and 5 year old children were antsy, hungry and thirsty so we left.  We went inside and sat at the counter. There were four other people in the big dining area, the register/ server man didn't even look at us. It was rude and I will never go back."}
{"text":"On 4/21/14 at around 7:43PM i tried to order two 99 cent burritos and add cheese. The cashier rung up the charge to a total of $7.  :(   The cashier is a moron who can't add math.    I informed him that it is Monday and on Monday there is 99 cent special for bean burritos.   He told me no, we no longer offer that.  Then i said\" Just for today or for now on?   He said\" Yes, no longer offer that for now on\".    I looked at the table nearby and the 99 cent special is still on the coupon.    I walked out before i could start cussing him out.

 Description of cashier: Hispanic man Wearing a apron, hat and reading glasses hanging from his neck. No name tag on his shirt.

  Very bad customer service..  This same Cashier 4 weeks ago overcharged me by $3. i asked for the correct change and he gave me $2 more back.  I was so pissed at this point i just left. 


 I'm calling the manager of this restaurant to complain about this man. The manager should tell the man to change his ways or get fired.  Simple as that.

 As long as that cashier is still working at this restaurant i will not buy anything from them."}
{"text":"You don't go for views and atmosphere, you go for wonderful Mexican food and fair pricing. Try the adobada (sp?) burrito or taco. Machaca is also very good. Great homemade salsas."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru, the chef I'm assuming came out and said hi and went back in. 15 mins later a different guy can to take my order. I almost thought they were closed? I just got three rolled tacos with rice and beans for 4.20$. Rang up to 5.50$? Guy didn't give me a fork so I had to eat with my salsa lid. The rice was hard halfway in, probably old, I did come at 830am. Rolled tacos were decent, can't really mess that up. This place was a bunch of disappointments one after the other. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Adobado burrito. Five bucks. Open 24 hours. 'Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Excellent cheap, authentic Mexican. 

I have been coming here since 2003.  As a vegetarian I usually get the vegetarian burrito.  A great deal ($4-$5)! I also enjoy the potato and cheese burrito ordered off menu ($3). The chips, quacumole and cheese are made with quality ingredients and I never skip the amazing salsa bar. I decided to be adventurous recently and get the cheese enchilidas with rice and beans. The sauce was tasty but the rest fell short. I'll stick to the burrito.

It helps if you or your dining buddy speak basic spanish. The staff always enjoys my friend's spanglish when attempting to ensure \"no carne\" is in our food.

As a 24 hour joint, I usually stop by in the wee hours.  However, I had lunch the other day with the same great quality! A relief to know my intoxication was not the sole reason for my love of the place."}
{"text":"If you want Mexican food in this area, do not make the mistake of going to the nearby Hal-O-Penos Mexican Cafe for \"microwaved mexican food\" and instead get some more authentic Mexican food from Los Armandos.  You can't have a bad Mexican place and start your restaurant name with \"Los\", huh?

Any of their burritos should be superb but the pollo asado burrito is a staple for me when I go to taqueria burrito places so please take this advice if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Better than the other huge franchise in the valley. The cashier is so sweet and the food is always great. I hesitated going for awhile, because from the street it's not that impressive and if you're from here you know that getting good food here is a crap shoot. But I was running late one day so gave it a shot. The carne asada burrito is so good and the rolled taco supreme is just beyond words. Tricky to eat, but amazing. Wasn't crazy about their milk cake though, it was soggy, like it had been frozen and defrosted"}
{"text":"They were once good. But not anymore. They refused to redo my order because they put guacamole (of which I'm allergic) after I told him nothing on them. Tortilla was undercooked and barely any meat. They wanted to charge me for the new order too! Ridiculous.... Not worth the price and the shitty service and rude looks from the cooks when they hear they made a mistake. I'm out 10.00 (for 4 tacos) and no dinner to eat. Thanks Armandos!"}
{"text":"I visit this place like twice a month. The woman who I guess is the sister of one of the owners provides  the worst customer service. Lady if you hate your job get another one.  I order my meal and waited 10 minutes in the drive thru. I get to the window to pay and I ask for a small salsa size cup of red chili sauce and she was adamant about charging me a dollar.  That's nuts I'm not trying to get anything for free but I think a dollar is ridiculous to charge for salsa, So I said fine keep your red sauce and thanks for the long wait.  I get home and my order is wrong so I had to go back and still even after wasting my time they still would not give me a side of red chili. Very very Bad customer service. I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR ORDER!

I ordered two fish tacos and the carne asada fries at the drive thru.  Made it home and what I got was two pork tacos and carne asada fries with no carne asada. So, that happened. Every thing tasted fine and the guy at the window was really nice but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a about 9 months for their breakfast burritos, on 6-6-16 I came in no one was at the  counter and I could see 2 guys in the back,  after about 2 min of me staring at the menu a guy came out.  I order and I payed using a credit card instead of my usual debit one. He must of thought I was buzzing or something but he tried playing a hand trick and tired hiding my credit card while I signed my receipt and then distracted me with another conversation,  I then realized I did not get my card back and asked for it back,  the guy kept telling me he gave it back and had me double check my wallet, a few seconds later I see my card flying behind him on to the floor.  I  did not make a scene but this is just intolerable. Los Armandos you just lost a customer fir hiring scumbags like this guy."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Plenty of menu choices, and the food was better than I would have expected. I had a couple tacos, topped with sauce from the salsa bar. Pretty good meats, decent toppings, and I'd say above average rice."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this restaurant, so I think I have been here about 40 times.  That might seem like a lot, but I really only go here about 4 or 5 times a year; they have been at this location quite awhile.  I remember when it was a breakfast diner, but that was a very long time ago.  I have lived in the neighborhood for about 20 years.

I am not giving this restaurant five stars because it is not a place that you have to visit or you haven't lived.  It is a place that is consistently GOOD.  I have never been disappointed with a meal here, but I have never got on the phone after finishing a meal and called everybody I know to tell them about the best meal I ever ate.  

The service is friendly.  The food is good.  The salsa is fine (not bad, not amazing, just good).  The restaurant is generally clean, but I always get my food to go, so I can't comment too much on the physical restaurant itself.

I have ordered a lot of different items (rolled tacos, breakfast burritos, bean burritos, carne asada burritos, pollo asado burritos, and every type of chimichanga they offer), and they have all been consistently GOOD.

If you are in the neighborhood, stop in; you won't be disappointed.  If you are looking for the best Mexican food you have ever tasted, and you are travelling an hour to get here, you can probably find an equally satisfying meal in your neck of the woods.

If I were you, I would give this place a chance.  I like it, and I wouldn't be surprised if I end up here another 40 times - given enough time."}
{"text":"The only reason I go to this place is because it's across the street from the hotel I stay at when I'm in town. Normally the service is ok, but today was different. Waited 5+ minutes for somebody to finally come out of the back and take my order. When he did it really didn't seem like he was paying attention. Maybe it was the cigarette tucked behind his ear. I walk back to my room and nothing on my order was correct. I went back and returned it and asked for my money back. Guess I won't be supporting this business during my future trips!"}
{"text":"I firmly believe that you get what you pay for. That being said, sometimes Mexican Food can flip that on you. It's one of the few exceptions that will occasionally deliver much more than you paid for it. Unfortunately, my lunch visit today to Los Armandos didn't deliver that.

I've dined here before, maybe a year ago, because it was recommended by a co-worker. His name is Rafael, and no, he is not Italian, so I trusted his advice. I've never had a problem with service at Los Armandos like some others have mentioned. (But honestly, the service you find in most places is awful!)

The atmosphere is a little quirky. There was some bizarre Mexican program on the television while me and a friend caught up over lunch. But it's a clean restaurant and it's busy whenever I've been there.

Today I selected something I haven't had in a while... The Machaca. The menu didn't say it was prepared with eggs, but I should've known because it was on a plate and not in a burrito. Regardless, it was pretty good. I ate every bite despite the lack of seasoning. I could taste egg. And I could taste beef. But it was bland unless I added some salsa or hot sauce from their bar.

My friend had a chimichanga, so his opinion doesn't count here... Otherwise, I will probably be back again cause I live in the area. It's not terrible, it's just not as good as so many other places I've been. Don't believe me? Check out how many other Mexican places I've Yelped about."}
{"text":"Food is eh. Service is TERRIBLE! They are rude and don't care about customers. Asked if they had more carrots because they were out in the front the lady went in the back and came out 15 minutes later because another employee told her I was there. I asked again about the carrots and she just said \"we don't have any\" she didn't even look!! Thanks for telling me and wasting my time! The armados a few blocks down is so much better!! I don't know how this place stays open for business."}
{"text":"They serve your classic Mexican food and do it pretty well. Plus, they have karaoke! *kidding* (joking about it being a plus, they do actually have a stage and mic.)
Their breakfast burritos are amazing and I love covering it in their house salsa. 
50 cent charge for CC and debit use! Bring your cash!"}
{"text":"i thought it was good and it's cheap mexican. just dont expect anything fancy-don't know that i would actually eat inside."}
{"text":"Charged me for food they didnt give me, when I called they told me I dont know, what do you want and I said I want a refund he said bye and come in the morning..... I want to eat my food and can't wait I till the morning to come back and get a refund horrible customer service...... Hung up on me 3 times...."}
{"text":"When we don't feel like driving to Fiesta Burrito, our next best place for \"OS\" food is Los Armandos. 

Descent food, descent prices. 

Our favorites - Adobada burrito or Adobada plate (plate comes with beans, rice, and a tortilla)

Don't forget the green sauce!"}
{"text":"I like this place. great beef taco plate"}
{"text":"How to tell a good hole in the wall mexican place: they have horchata, and it doesn't come from a fountain. This place has horchata, and while they don't have one of those horchata-mixer things on display, it tasted pretty fresh. They also have a menu completely full of things that sound tasty - in fact, they seemed to have run out of space for tastiness on their menu, cause there was a second overflow menu under it, also full of things that sounded tasty. Though they realized they were out of sopes after ringing one up, and had to give me a taco instead, but oh well. If you're staying at one of the hotels around here, and you want cheap food, this is the place to go. 

Service is pretty terrible (mostly because it's a tossup whether anyone will speak enough English to be useful), but do you really care at a place like this? 

Note: I came back the next year, I dunno what it was, the food wasn't as good this year as last year. Still good, though."}
{"text":"I would absolutely love to tell you that I discovered a gem on Thomas Road. I would love to be able to write how magnificent this place was but alas, I can't. I never got to taste anything. I never got to order anything. I walked into this dirt hole, holding my breath and tongue, and willing to order something in the hope that I could find some good Mexican food (good Mexican food is actually an oxymoron), anyway, I stood where it said \"order here.\" I stood, and stood, I looked around, it appeared there was still business being conducted. A couple were eating in a booth. Hmmm....I stood. Waiting. No one came out from the back to acknowledge me, or take my order.

Now this isn't Pizzeria Bianco where if you ignore me I will wait. If you spit on me I will wipe it off and take the abuse to be able to experience the pizza. No, this is a dirty, disgusting Mexican dump situated a few feet across from an hourly motel and down the street from a strip club. This place should be lucky anyone has walked in and kiss my feet. Well, I gave up, I started to walk out and just as I was heading to the door, some \"person\" walked out from the back. I left.

If the service is that bad, I can't believe the food is going to sway me otherwise. In fact, I feel like I was saved from a case of botulism or diphtheria."}
{"text":"Always great eats and ample portions....and even menudo on Mondays often. From all the items we have ordered in the menu, and we have tried many, we have always been very happy. If we can have Taco Tuesdays how about Menudo Mondays."}
{"text":"Late one night, compelled by hunger and a dwindling bank account my boyfriend and I decided to try Los Armandos on a dare. While we are not picky eaters caution is the watch word when considering a place to grab a late night nosh.

To our surprise, we quickly discovered two things: #1) exceedingly low prices and #2) and after midnight no one in the joint speaks English.

On our first trip we ordered Carne Asada for me and a #6 combo platter for my other half. Upon arriving at our mutual dwellings, we both crossed ourselves and said a prayer, then when at it.

The Carne Asada fries filled the styrofoam container to the breaking point; the meat was very tender, very flavorful and very plentiful and the fries were freshly 'Frenched.'

My boyfriend's #6 combo platter taco/beef burrito with rice and beans left him hovering 18\" above the floor for several hours after he consumed the food.

In all, we have become true devotees of this well-lit hole in the wall little patch of Mexico!

We highly recommend to this place anyone who happens to be low on cash, big on appetite and in the general vicinity."}
{"text":"Great authentic mexican food..reasonable prices
Had a Carne asada tortas delicious! Ceviche tostada was well worth the money they served plenty of Ceviche had plenty of flavor.."}
{"text":"This is my go to place. I can only comment on the carne asada fries and tacos, but I've never been disappointed. They're not at all skimpy on any of the ingredients with the fries. Also I'm weird about my fountain drinks and I'm happy to say their Dr. Pepper is perfectly carbonated. It's the small things."}
