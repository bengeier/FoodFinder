{"text":"The pizza was greasy and made my nephew and I sick the bottom of the pizza was black if I could this place a zero stars"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Pepperoni pizza was burnt. We weren't acknowledged when we walked up to the counter but ignored by the server as he was having a conversation with a friend sitting at a table behind us."}
{"text":"The lines for this place were long. So that tells you how good it is! We got the spaghetti and meatballs meal with a salad! It was warm and good! Ask for extra cheese when they heat up your food, it makes all of the difference."}
{"text":"Ugh, I got the buffalo chicken pizza. It looked pretty wicked but I tried it anyway but as you could imagine, it tasted horrible. I took two bites and threw it out. The chicken wasn't even real chicken, it tasted like rubber. They doused the pizza in hot sauce and it barely had any cheese.  Just the thought of it makes me want to never eat pizza again (but come on, that will never happen)!  Please, keep your money and go to another vendor in the food court. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Anything but fresh. The food had obviously been sitting out for the duration of the day, to the point the server had to stir it before serving me. What I thought was spaghetti sauce ended up being grease and tomato paste. I fought thru half of the generous bowl of noodles, and washed it back with the the best part of the meal, a cold Gatorade. I'd fly past this airport location, and try my luck at the nearest sandwich cooler next time."}
{"text":"Terrible Spaghetti! They Microwaved it right in front of me. My empty slot on my to-go dish was then filled with a watery fluid where they put my Garlic Bread. I will not eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Pizza was overly expensive at about $6.00 plus for a regular slice.  It tasted OK but nothing special for this price."}
{"text":"First of all, shame on you Villa Pizza, you ruined my stay at the Red Rock. This was my first night at Red Rock and I was excited, tired and hungry! And what do you know? Villa pizza was selling there slices half off!! So with a family of four, I ordered an entire pizza of course not forgetting to ask if the pizza was fresh, bc we all know if it sounds too good to be true, it more than likely is. Well the guy reassured me they had just made the pizza so I paid $10 for a whole pizza, went to my room and chowed down w my husband, two year old and one year old babies. The next morning, our guts bubbles and our Vegas/Red Rock experience was completely ruined by and constantly interrupted by sprints to the nearest restroom. It was bad. Really bad. Luckily my babies didn't feel the wrath until we made it home last night. They had low grade fevers and woke up this morning with 103 degree temps. I gave the baby motrin and booked them for a trip to the doctor. I hate seeing them sick and I want to really slap the guy who KNEW the pizza was no good and SAW me with my babies yet still sold it to me and everyone one else behind us. Anything for a dollar right, Villa Pizza? That includes selling rank pizza???? I wouldn't have given it away for free. Have some morals and ethics. Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Stromboli was amazing. But the gentleman working was the reason I even chose the place. He was so friendly as I was browsing the choices in the food court that he drew me in, as well as another gentleman walking nearby. He was just so friendly, and sometimes we go without that in society these days. Made it pleasant to eat there. Was waiting on the Apple Store so I had no choice but to get some food, and he made it enjoyable."}
{"text":"I decided to take the kids out for a movie at red rock station we were hungry after so decided to visit the food court. My boys decided on villa pizza we walked over and Anthony asked what we wanted I said one slice of pizza and one slice of cheese he said okay then said we don't have anymore pepperoni I just dropped it did you want pepperoni and sausage? Never apologized and came across very rude I said no we can just do 2 slices of cheese he said okay that'll be 10 minutes and walked down to checkout the customer in front of us. He then came back I asked for his name and to speak to his manager he said he is the manager I asked why he was being so rude he dropped our slice and didn't apologize and was very rude and not personable he said well if you want fresh pizza then you'd need to wait! I said that's fine have a good day I'll never go back there and think he needs to work on his customer service skills to say the least!"}
{"text":"$3.00 for a soda, $5 for a slice of cheese.  Oh and best of all... $.75 for a refill.  That's what got me on Yelp.  I already gave them my $8.00... and they still wanted $.75 more.  A refill costs them literally a couple pennies.   Basically, this is your typical re-heated thin slice of pizza.  But if they offered free refills, they wouldn't be on blast right now.  A little customer service goes a long ways you guys.  Pay rent but don't short change your paying customers.  Charge more on the soda up front, but give free refills.  Make the customer feel \"royal.\"   I recommend trying the other restaurants at food court.  Sorry to do this to these guys... but come on.  Charge me your price but don't gouge me once I'm already your customer.  If you had free refills, then you don't get this post from me.  Less than average place."}
{"text":"Pizza was terrible. A Digorno or even a Red Baron would have tasted 100 times better. Lacked sauce, cheese and overall just dry. Huge disappointment. They use the word \"fresh\" very loosely in their marketing.. very loosely.. the only reason I ate it was bc I was hungry and just dropped $10 on a stale overcooked piece of bread."}
{"text":"We were hungry and wanted a quick bite to eat for lunch before doing our shopping. My boyfriend was happy to see Italian food so we decided to give it a try. I saw a Stromboli meal that came with the Stromboli, a side, and a medium drink. I felt that it was a fair deal so I decided to go for it. After putting my Stromboli in the oven to heat it up, the worker asked me what I wanted for a side. Because she was standing in front of the wings, I assumed it was a side and asked for that. When we got to the register to pay, the worker asked us if we wanted a drink. I was confused and said that I had ordered the meal, and she sassily responded that \"that's not a meal, you have wings and that's not a side. Now do you want a drink?\" I was very upset and a nice male worker could tell, so he offered to give us a drink. However the terrible cashier still rang us up and made us pay $3 for a small cup of soda. I was so upset by the whole experience that I lost my appetite and basically ended up throwing away my food. Safe to say I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"The pizza there is great don't get me wrong, but they had made the wrong transaction and iI had told them and the young male working there didn't apologize at all and neither did the manager. WORST costumer service ever get it right the first time."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great pizza for a little cubby in a food court in a shopping mall. Veggie pizza was impressively stuff with veggies, and a nice amount of cheese. Hawaiian pizza had a good amount of ham and pineapple. Really appreciate the shakers of chili peppers and Parmesan at check out. If you need a quick bite, and you need a slice, you will be happy here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place,  now I love to hate it. They are rude, have no customer service and lack common sense.  I pre ordered 8 pizzas, two salads, two chicken rolls and five, 2-liter sodas. They sat as I had to wait for the girl to be ready to help me, then it seemed inconvenient that I asked for plates, napkins and forks. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"This is the token pizza option at the food court- choice of thin crust or pan crust, along with other options like salads, calzones, pastas, and... fried chicken? There's a sign advertising their special chicken, the only catch is it's $6/piece. Pretty absurd.  Pan crust pizza comes in large slices for a normal price, ~$5. Also options to get a whole pie with two drinks or sides for $24, if you have a group. Nothing noteworthy about service except that this is one of the quicker lines here."}
{"text":"Service wasn't as prompt as usual. Always friendly though. The lack of selection weighed my opinion on staying with pizza, but I settled cuz it's all good here!"}
{"text":"I never met a pizza I didn't like till I came here! Service was with attitude from the lil mexican girl (almost Like I owed her something) and the side salad was mini portion and half of it was brown I will be here for 3 days and my kids and I will steer clear of this place!"}
{"text":"Edible pizza that is similar in quality to a typical Sbarro's.  I guess the reason why I still eat this kind of stuff is it reminds me of my happy childhood days eating food court pizza.  The tomato/onion salad tasted a little strange and the dressing lacked much taste. Not sure why a few of the tomato slices were bitter, thats a new one."}
{"text":"My experience started off great by ordering a pizza value meal from a really nice worker. Then he passed me off the a girl who kindly charged and took my payment. Here's where it gets interesting...So I looked at my receipt and saw I got charged $9.29 instead of $8.69 that was posted on the board. On the menu, it states the value meal includes a slice of pizza, one side, and a medium drink. I went back to the cashier and asked why was I getting charged higher than what was posted. Her answer? \"I had to charge you for a Large drink since we are out of medium cups.\" I got mad since she could've told me this BEFORE charging me! I then asked for a manager, which by the way, didn't help at all. Half the time the girl had to speak to him in spanish for translation. So, instead of just having me keep my son's drink, which he already drank from, they gave me 50 cents and took the Large drink and changed it into a small one! And no apology! Customer service sucks here BIG TIME. You better watch what you get charged here since you are probably getting overcharged without you knowing! Scammers!"}
{"text":"This business does not have a chip reader so they took my debit card behind the counter to make payment.  As the gentleman handed my card and receipt back, I noticed him looking closely at the BACK of my card as he was passing it.  I thought the was VERY STRANGE, and thought to myself, \"  If my card is compromised over the next 3 days, I know where it came from.  And I WAS RIGHT!  My card was compromised and I had to cancel my card.  SOOO MAD AND FRUSTRATED.  This is my story... take it for what it's worth, but buyer beware!"}
{"text":"I was in Red Rock Casino and a bit hungry, so I thought I'd get a slice. The server was distracted, and forgot that I'd ordered my pizza to go.  I ordered one of the deep dish slices, which was about $5.50.  He put it in the oven for less than a minute- so when I got to my car to eat it, it was barely lukewarm.  Besides that, the crust was HARD. I could barely bite into it.  They say that there's no such thing as bad pizza...I beg to differ!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for pizza on August 7th. The pizza didn't look freshly made and appeared as though it had been sitting for hours so we opted for a meal instead. The signage indicated their special was something called triple play for $9.19.  According to the sign it was a chicken cutlet, pasta and salad. Seemed fair so we ordered two. Halfway through the meal my husband looked at the receipt and noticed he was charged $9.19 for one and $10.18 for the second one. He approached the counter person who rang him up to ask why. The employee said \"you ordered premium salads\". Still having the salads uneaten, my husband said that wasn't the case. We had one regular tossed and one Caesar. The employee realized his mistake but didn't know how to process a refund so he called the manager, Jose, to the front. Jose immediately upon listening to my husband's explanation began screaming that the receipt said we had premium salads and that justified the extra charge. He didn't care that his employee made the mistake. He just kept screaming \"no refund\". My husband asked why the signage didn't specify that certain salads came with an additional charge. The response was \"I don't owe you any explanation. Now get away from my counter or I'm calling security\".  The food was only mediocre and for a buck my husband wasn't going to lower himself to the level of this highly unprofessional employee so we tossed the remainder of our food and left. NOTE: this was the only set of employees in the food court not wearing gloves. They were making and serving food and handling money all without gloves. My husband asked the counter help why and the guy just shrugged his shoulders and offered no response."}
{"text":"Poor guest service. If ur looking for service with an attitude this is ur spot. Won't be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"I am seriously so disgusted. I got a pizza and lemonade for to go . Half way into drinking my lemonade I realized there was s freaking ROACH in my drink !! Are you kidding me."}
{"text":"Charging $10 for reheated left over is not quality . The pizza sitting right out for front for options is looks day old. Is tossed to reheat in an oven while you wait 7 to 10 minutes .. I'd rather order delivery and get fresh, less expensive and better quality ."}
{"text":"Food was decent; the pizza was better than the pasta. Towards the end of the night, they were out of certain sides. A combo is about $9 for a Sicilian pizza w/ a side & drink. The counter was messy with lots of napkins and straw wrappers, but no one bothered to clean it. I'll go here if the Fatburger line is too long because you get your food almost instantly."}
{"text":"Villa Roma is located within las veg as s intl airport. They serve s tromboli, spaghetti and pizza. The pizza is personal size and you have a choice of cheese,pepperoni and everything. The pizza is precooked and ready for you to grab. I had my reservations ordering a pizza in a airport, but it was not bad, not gre as t but eatable. The pizza is like a pan pizza with thick crust. The sauce was tasty and they did not skimp on the cheese. The toppings were a bit thin , but it is a small pizza.  One big negative is these pizzas sit under s heatlamp in a cardboard box and they tend yt? o dry out. Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"It's pizza at airport. You shouldn't expect much.   Well actually I got stromboli combo.  The pepperoni stromboli was a little spicy but wasn't warn enough to have melted cheeses.   The Bolognese sauce was nice touch, you can also get Alfredo sauce over it.   The combo came with side of pasta or mac n cheese, I opted for Mac n cheese not bad satisfy had real tasting cheese!   But I like hot food, even in airport.   There are better places here."}
{"text":"Village Fresh Italian Kitchen is in the food court at Ross Park Mall. My girlfriends and I stopped for a late lunch during an afternoon mall trip, and I got a spinach stromboli with a diet coke. It was decent, but not the best I've ever had AND it was over $7. That seems a little pricey for a food court quick lunch stop. I'd probably try another place in the food court the next time I'm at the mall."}
{"text":"Grab a slice! You are hanging out in Red Rock Casino, kinda bored, heading to the next activity.   Totally fine pizza by the slice!"}
{"text":"Every time I get anything from here it's awful! Last week I got a piece of cheese pizza. It was so flimsy and greasy that I took it back. I told the young male working the counter that I wanted a different piece of pizza and he totally gave me attitude asking what was wrong with it. I was trying to be quiet because there were people in line and I didn't want other people to know what was going on because I didn't want them to lose business. I held it up and said it was greasy and flimsy and I wanted a fresh piece. He said, \"well can I have that piece back?\" And I responded, \"most certainly.\" He then send it to me, very rudely, \"well you don't have to be a jerk about it.\"I asked him to repeat what he said because I couldn't even believe it, and he repeated it.The manager came out of the back because the line was getting longer and I discreetly told him that his worker was incredibly rude to me. He seemed to absolutely not care."}
{"text":"We stopped by at the outlet on our way back to LA and decided to grab something to eat.  I think this place used to be Sbarro.  We all ordered the #5 (Chicken entree) which came with a side (garlic bread) and medium soda.  The food was subpar but it did the job as far as supplying nourishment prior to a long drive home."}
{"text":"I know nobody likes airport food.   But I have to tell you I had a most exceptional service experience with these guys this morning they were friendly and warm and really accommodated my needs.  I often just grab a salad from them before boarding a plane in the afternoon this morning it was early so I had their breakfast and it was very good but the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"had a sicilian pizza that was good....but they put it on foil and it stuck on the foil and that was incredibly annoying....almost had foil for dinner....NO BUENO, MAN."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing, servicr is great, but the rest of the food is kinda meh, but its my tradition to have pizza when I cash my paycheck and villa is my fave pizza place, but yhe buffalo wings are kinda soggyish and the ziti is ok, ill be back just for the pizza"}
{"text":"Crooks: I ordered a slice of pepperoni and wings, as the large sign behind the girls stated for $7 the girl said it came with a side and a drink (neither of which, I wanted), but went along with it. So I go to pay and they change the price to almost $10 As I explain that the large sign behind her says a different price,  she says \"we don't serve wings here\". Seriously? Ok. Would give one star but the pizza slice wasn't half bad. Definitely not worth $10 for a slice but good. Stay away if you expect to get what you order and pay MORE for."}
{"text":"Got the margarita chicken panini... don't do it! Bread is like rubber and I'm not sure it's even edible as i chewed and chewed and it never broke down. In fact I'm alittle worried for my stomach. I got it to go or i would have returned it!"}
{"text":"For some reason, I wanted pasta for lunch and (thought I) was lucky enough to find an Italian fastfood store at the outlets.  Meh.  I really have experienced better.  The Stromboli (spinach and cheese roll) rates 3 stars. ($5.50) The Lasagna, although big enough to share, rates 2 stars.  ($8.00)  Won't be dropping by this place if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"I had their muscle builder shake, with a scoop of whey. It wasn't bad at all. The girl serving me was really nice. & It was perfect how they had the samples for that shake I wanted. I loved it. I wish they had it out if the mall. :-("}
{"text":"This Villa Pizza is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. I would doubt anybody makes a special trip just to eat the pizza here, but it does work out nicely after getting out of a movie for grabbing a quick bite. I wouldn't eat at the chain Villa Pizza for years since I grew up on the locally owned original, but sometimes you have to stop being stubborn which is exactly what I did.   When I walked by I wasn't sure if I wanted to eat here or at Rubio's, then I saw a fresh cheese pizza come out of the oven and knew that I wanted a slice. The girl behind the counter was nice. A \"Cheese Slice\" cost $3.79 before tax. For being in a food court and a chain, the pizza was A-OK. I didn't think the price was bad, but I also shared my husbands drink from Panda Express (panda has a decent medium and large size for the price with free refills). Definitely not the best pizza in town, but is decent enough for a quick dinner. They have table and half table/booth seating in the food court area."}
{"text":"Its decent pizza and they have a nice variety of food to choose from. It does not compare to a stand alone Villa Pizza. There is definitely a quality difference.  The pizza slices are a little smaller and not as floppy as you would expect from other Villas.   With no one in line but my family and I, we waited 5 minutes for one of the 3 staff to address us with even a hello or be with you when we feel like it.  The prices still beat paying movie pricing though for a less feeling amount of junk food."}
{"text":"Great food! The people here are really friendly and interact with the customers! The managers are all great and always help you if you need something! Over all a great place to eat and a must stop if your ever out this way!"}
{"text":"If overpriced food thats been sitting for awhile is your thing then this is the place for you. But not for me. My stuffed vegetable pizza pie was soggy and unappatizing.  The pepperoni pizza was stale. The salad? That was okay. In 10 seconds of interacting the service wasnt bad as they rushed me along but no smiles. I know its a get in get out assembly but still you should serve people with a smile when theyre polite to you. The food was very overpriced for what you get. Nearly $3.50 for just a medium soda and $1 to refill. This isnt an amusement park and your for isnt that good."}
{"text":"I visited this location inside the Red Rock  and I have to say this was the worst Villa Pizza and ultimately one of the worst pizza places I've ever been too.  The food was mediocre and overpriced. The staff were rude, unprofessional, and clueless about pricing. That made things extremely confusing since there is no straightforward menu or prices listed anywhere for any regularly served items. There is one sign off to the right of the pizzas that says one whole pie and 2 sides or 2 medium drinks for $19.99. When I asked how much a pepperoni pizza was on its own, one of the girls guessed $14 or $15 and her co-worker guessed $15 or $16. After I insisted they find out, the second girl walked over the register with some attitude and pushed the button. Turns out a large pepperoni is $16.99. Most of the sides don't look very appetizing or appealing either. They look like they've been sitting there all day, with the exception of the chicken parmigiana. That's when you find out there will be an additional up charge per side of chicken which is contrary to what the first girl told me,which was that any side could be included in the deal. Disappointing for a Villa Pizza."}
{"text":"My first review of this was when it was a Sbarro, I'm quite sure. Now that it's \"Villa,\" the veggie stromboli (spinach, tomato, and feta) isn't quite as good. It's big, and filling, but the half a pound or so of spinach and tomatoes needs to be drained of some of its water. Perhaps a bit heavier on the cheese (maybe try a mix of feta & mozzarella) and a bit less wet veg and they'll have the ratio right."}
{"text":"Decent New York pizza in fiesta casino. Nice crust and toppings with combos offering decent side salads like Greek or Caesar. Pretty nice surprise."}
{"text":"Villa Fresh Italian Kitchen - McCarran Airport (Terminal 1 / C-Gates)  I am really jealous of all the travelers flying in and out of Terminal 3.  They have all the good restaurants.  When you're in Terminal 1, specifically the C-Gates, you're limited to a lot of fast food.  Villa Fresh Italian Kitchen is just another fast food restaurant inside the C-Gates.  Lunch and dinner is okay.  They have pizza, meatballs, and pasta.  I'll usually go with their wings for lunch or dinner.  I recommend Villa Fresh if you're here early enough for breakfast.  Their eggs, bacon, sausage, and pancakes is as good as you're going to get in this terminal.  Good Luck!"}
{"text":"We were reeled in by the free samples the other day!  Boyfriend and I were in Ross Park Mall for a few hours and needed something to hold us over until lunch.  Checked out the mall's food court, and--behold--an employee handed over a few chunks of cut up Chicken Stromboli on toothpicks.  Sold!  We split a Chicken Stromboli, and it was pretty good.  Just the right amount of tasty bread, decent quality cheese, a nice amount of chicken, and surprisingly not very greasy at all.  And much thanks to the super-cool employee for the side of tangy marinara sauce for no extra charge!  Enjoyed our impromptu snack in the mall's nice spacious food court that has a variety of seating options."}
{"text":"Villa is located post security in the Main Terminal area of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport - after passing through the TSA security checkpoint - make a right and you will find yourself in a food court of sorts.  Villa offers a range of pizza styles, salads, and some pasta dishes.  I was starving when I arrived at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport - so I opted to sit for a few minutes and wolf down a slice of pizza - sausage with banana peppers. They placed my slice in the oven to heat it up - so it was served piping hot. Your typical mass produced greasy pizza slice. But it was hot and tasty - hit the spot and got me going!"}
{"text":"Today was their re-opening I guess and I took my family to eat . At first I didn't quite know what to order but there was 2 young ladies one didn't have a name tag but her name was jasmine and ghe other lady Eloísa. They were so nice and very patient she mentioned to me her bosses like to review yelp so here I am my first review and I'm glad to say it was to villa! Amazing food the pizza sauce is delicious. Great customer service I will definitely be going back next week! Thank you ladiess"}
{"text":"Sorry but we will never eat here again. The mac & cheese was so bland. Just noodles with cheese thats it!  We waited 10 minutes for under done watery baked zitti.  Meatballs were amazing and the girls were nice which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars.  Italian food needs flavor, this had zero flavor.  Highly disappointed"}
{"text":"The pizza here is okay...I usually like my pizza piping hot with the cheese nice and gooey. Whenever I get pizza here it's warm. I usually love all garlic bread but this one is too greasy. It still decent pizza to get when you are on the go!"}
{"text":"I give this place 1 star because they did something very ridiculous during my layover visit at C terminal at McCarran Airport recently.  I ordered food then asked for a cup of hot water, which I have been drinking since childhood plus I would have a hard time sleeping if I ordered hot tea.  I always ask for hot water at every single fast food or restaurant I visited and there has never been a problem until I visited this place.  This one staff told me that they would have to charge me for hot tea which cost $2.29.  I told him it was ridiculous and he claimed that every restaurant in the airport did that.  I did not have time or didn't bother to verify that but I really do not believe it was the truth.  That was too petty.  How can someone do business not being generous.  They better understand they will lose thousands of customers for wanting to charge their customer $2.29 for something that hardly cost anything.  I will not give this place any more business.  No more visits !"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a pesto Stromboli , I asked politely if they could make me a fresh one as the ones they had looked old, the cheese was hard and looked cold. The young lady at the front asked her manager and through the door he shook his head and gave me a dirty look? Not sure where these people learned their customer service but they definitely lost my business ..."}
{"text":"Leslie gave us amazing service!!! She was very polite, informative and funny.  We tried the vegetarian pizza and it was pretty good. I like the fact that they put it in the oven to have it nice and warm for you after you choose which slide."}
{"text":"So we start off by walking up to the counter and see what they have ..we came here to see a movie movie. I have a big sign on the counter that says 15% off with your movie stub ..so I went over and bought our tickets first. So we ordered our dinner chicken with spaghetti with meat sauce and a salad. The girl says what's your ticket stub its only 10% off-is that ok ? My response was why does the sign say 15%? .. her reply was oh it's been wrong for a long time. The chicken was rubbery and Chicken McNugget type of meat. Spaghetti was good but it was kind of confusing why she had to put it in the microwave for 3 minutes before she would serve it to us when it was sitting on a hot plate ...maybe not so hot !! Well I understand why nobody has wasted their time doing reviews on this little dump . I must have gotten the same little girl that the last reviewer got with the  snotty attitude !!- like I owed her something for her having a job Well next time it's Fatburger they never disappoint never come to this place again."}
{"text":"I stopped here because the Stromboli looked tasty. I took a bite of the pepperoni and cheese roll, and it was completely cold. I understand this is a fast food place with teenagers working here. The concern was, when I returned to the counter to have my food reheated, the manager was there. He clearly heard my complaint, he walked away into the back. The least that he could have done was apologize! Thumbs down :(~"}
{"text":"This review is for the Villa Fresh at Beachwood Place mall.  The pizza here is very good.  Nice puffy non-greasy crust with very good sauce and cheese.  Almost 'NY style' in taste and execution.  Kudos to them!  The baked ziti is fantastic, with fresh tasting stringy cheese and aromatic, slightly zesty tomato sauce.  Just what I needed on a late morning mission to find the LEGO store for our spoiled (wouldn't have it any other way) little princess!"}
{"text":"Pizza tastes like gross reheated greasy cardboard! And we unfortunately got 6 of them. The side of potatoes was under cooked, but if you like raw greasy potatoes then yay! No napkins! Only gave us 1 small cup of ranch for all the food we ordered and when I asked for more ranch he said \"yeah sure\" then started helping the person behind me without ever giving me more ranch. Lots of other choices at the food court we won't be picking this one ever again!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here and for the price it's an awesome deal for mall food .. the pizza tastes really good and the choices of side are awesome .. first time I got a slice of pizza and spaghetti .. second time slice of pizza and bread sticks and it comes with a drink for like $8 and it's warm and tasty way better than Sbarro.  Plus the employees have been super friendly and helpful both times .."}
{"text":"This pizza chain is one of kind.  Villa Pizza has one of the best recipes around!!  This one is located inside the Red Rock Casino.  The service is quick.  The ingredients are premium and the taste is delicious.  It is well known for its New York style thin crust!  Been there many a times and it still is the same great flavor every time."}
{"text":"Just had the breakfast.  Money well spent compared to BK down the way. Fresher. Pancakes sausage. Recommend for quick breakfast before a flight."}
{"text":"Eh--- not bad... not bad  Stopped here after bingo (yes, bingo!) and ordered the Stromboli Combo. Choice of pepperoni, greek, or chicken ranch stromboli with a side and a soda for $8 and change. Not terrible pricing for inside a casino. The stromboli was pretty good.. I was not in the mood for pepperoni and I the Greek one wasn't for me so I tried the chicken-ranch. Flavor wise, not bad -- could have gone without the broccoli inside (when I think chicken-ranch I don't think broccoli). Not that I don't enjoy broccoli but just wasn't needed and it was not good quality. As a side I ordered Baked Ziti-- definately a star-saver. Definately helped push it to 3 stars.  Anyway, all in all not a bad option for a quick meal in the Red Rock Casino"}
{"text":"Service sucked, pizza was not good, but it was expensive. Eight bucks for two slices of oily over cooked pizza with dough that was not thin enough to be considered new York style. Eat elsewhere. You've been warned."}
{"text":"I ate garlic knots and pizza here. The dough for the garlic knots was really chewy and it they tasted like they have been out for a while. The pizza was okay, but honestly I have eaten better frozen pizzas."}
{"text":"Poo service, REALLY expensive, and the pizza was served cold (even after going back into the oven). I have no idea how long the pizza was under those heat lamps, but the flavor was pretty poor as well. Only reason this is 2 stars and not 1, is because they were open when I needed them, and they were close enough to my gate to catch my flight on a quick lay ever...

{"text":"Are you serious?  if you offer takeout you need to package it so that the sauce does not run into everything else including the bread.  Also to have packets of powdered Parmesan that were shown to me but never added to the order.  When I got it home the whole thing was a sopping mess with the sauce at the bottom of the bag all over my napkins and no Parmesan.    Unlikely you will ever see me again."}

{"text":"Believe the hype, airport food service are super expensive!! $4.75 for a slice of pizza. Totally not worth it.   Really nothing special about the pizza   Wait to you get to your destination for Food, prices like that only the rich will eat."}
{"text":"My friends and I were hungry after a night of clubbing in Vegas, but we didn't want to get ready so we headed to the mall nearby our hotel to hit up the food court. This food court had a ton of options but I was really craving pasta so I came here. This place is exactly like a Sabarro. I ended up ordering the spaghetti combo. It came with two large meatballs, a garlic bread knotts and pasta salad. I'm writing this review about two weeks late so I can't exactly remember the price but I do remember it was about $10. For the price I paid it came with a ton. I could not finish my food at all. Remembering that it is food court food, I really enjoyed it. The garlic bread knot was sooo good. It was cheesy too and heavenly. The spaghetti and meatballs were good for the most part, but I will say that the meatballs tasted super frozen and processed. But really I couldn't complain considering the circumstances. It was still good though. I couldn't even get to my pasta salad because I was too full.  Overall, pretty good food and it's definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"They got my takeout order wrong & the chicken strombolli was undercooked. The spinach strombolli was tasty, and I can't review the pepperoni because they gave me chicken instead. After sending my comments on-line, a company rep called me to apologize.  I'm grateful for the excellent service, and I would return to Villa Pizza, but will try to check the takeout order before I leave!"}
{"text":"Waiting until 9 p.m. to eat means that the pizzas are not going to come fresh and piping hot out of the oven, so I'm taking into consideration that any slice I would have chosen had been sitting around for who knows how long.    Adding to the woes is that I like my pizzas very crisp, and on that count Villa delivered.  I can't stand it when I ask for crisp pizza, pick up a slice, and have it droop.  This sucker stood up like, well, use your imagination.  But to get it that way, it had to stay in the oven longer than usual, and now I don't know whether it seemed dried out from sitting out too long, or staying in too long!  I chose the one lone leftover slice with spinach and mushrooms. (Gotta get those veggies in). It's thicker than East Coast pizza, but not so thick that it's like having only bread.  Overall, it wasn't bad, but wasn't over the top with flavor, so I'd have to rate it simply okay.  It cost 5 bucks with the toppings, but it was a pretty big slice. Maybe pricey by average pizza place standards, but one slice is enough to make a quick meal, and probably among the cheapest meals you can get at the food court.  Jeez, even an ice cream cone there is $5!"}
