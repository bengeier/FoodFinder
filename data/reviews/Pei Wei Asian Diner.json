{"text":"Friends,  BEWARE! One of the saltiest, if not THE saltiest, meal I've ever had. Looks good. Smells good. Don't fall for the same trap I did."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The price is also quite cheap. Very good quality to prive ratio."}
{"text":"For a location in an airport that should be sensitive of people's time, this place has the slowest service ever! But what's worse, they couldn't give a crap either. HORRIBLE... I took my business two doors down and won't be coming back"}
{"text":"worst ever!!!!the rice is hard ?the dish is salt. Be careful !!!!!! This is the worst Asian food I found in this planet"}
{"text":"Before you place your order, check your watch. They promise 5 minutes but can take 20 to prepare. Wrong order items are a possibility too."}
{"text":"Not sure why other reviews for this place are less than glowing. I was greeted by a friendly staff and my food was delivered promptly! The food itself was great and better yet they had a gluten free option in an Airport!!! It's hard to find celiac friendly dining locations when traveling, especially with good food."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, when I order my shrimp fried rice and ask for no red peppers about half the time there aren't any and half re time there are... really only one person who busses and runs food at night so it can be hard to find a clean table."}
{"text":"So I can't believe I'm giving this place 4 stars but the items I ordered really hit the spot. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and the pork egg roll. They kind of blew away my expectations. I would order them again. Better than expected for airport Asian food. :-)"}
{"text":"Good portion if they serve you to eat in the small seating area but if they think you won't get a table they assume it's to go & they skimp on the portions."}
{"text":"Sufficient for airport pre flight meal. Not unique but decent in quality of ingredients. Rice to meal ratio was poor...too much rice."}
{"text":"For 'Asian Fusion' food, and in-airport dining, this is a nice touch.  Have dined at other locations outside the airport and, while portions are a bit smaller and the menu limited, still a pretty good value and very tasty.  Had the Steak Fried Rice and it was excellent and freshly prepared."}
{"text":"Vegan definition is wrongly understood by this team, trying, they do have everything to be a great kitchen!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar area only at Pei Wei.  The bartender was very rude. We were waiting for a delayed flight and decided to get a drink.  We sat down at the bar and the bartender was extremely rude because I wasn't ready with my drink order when I sat down.  If I'm paying for an over-priced drink and supposed to tip the guy, I expect to be treated nicely.  I was so upset and It ruined my night."}
{"text":"Place was disgusting. Couldn't even sit down anywhere for a drink. Trash and leftover food everywhere. Who knows how often wait staff cleans up.  Walked in.... walked out."}
{"text":"Not a favorite but okay to eat for a dinner. Tried the teriyaki chicken with rice but it was over powering with heavy sauce. Couldn't taste the veggies."}
{"text":"Long travel days with food allergies is always a crapshoot, so when I find a place that actually has gluten-free menu I'll eat whatever it is. It's a bonus that Pei Wei has a delicious gluten-free spicy chicken (that you can actually order non-spicy).  I'd recommend getting a side of sweet chili sauce to go with it.   *Also, the gluten free Pei Wei spicy chicken is not a normal menu item at most Pei Wei locations.  This dish is actually the PF Chang's Spicy Chicken dish which is a bonus because I like that dish better than the gluten free sweet and sour chicken dish found at most Pei Wei locations.  Kudos Las Vegas airport for having a yummy gluten-free option."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is great!  They have really stepped up their game after many years of struggling.  Because Fountain Hills is really limited in healthy dining out choices, I find my family here multiple times per week sometimes.  The cost is reasonable, the food comes out fresh and fast so the kids don't get restless and we have food choices on the healthier side.  I LOVE the Lemongrass Chicken Salad.    One compliant...they need to do something about the varnish coming off on the tables.  It makes it feel like the tables are still dirty even though I saw them clean them."}
{"text":"If you like your food dry then this is the place to come the staff was rude and non approachable. I was craving chicken and rice and now I regret spending 15$ on bad food and service. Go somewhere else in the airport. I won't be back here."}
{"text":"I usually love Pei Wei but this place is nothing like the rest of the brand.  I waited for 20minutes and got to the front of the line. The guy didn't even respond or look up. Then he told me to go to another register. I tried to get a veggie meal. Instead of helping she just told me they don't have tofu and walked away. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Food too salty, lack of seating space, airport alarm frequently goes off"}
{"text":"Was expecting something average, got something worse. Veggies have texture as rubber, rice feels fake, and sauce is too strong. Would be nice if we could have fast food options that are healthy, feel like I would have been better off going to BK next door. :/ airport food... When will be able to have fresh food in airport? It cost 15 dollars, which is enough one would think."}
{"text":"not very big serving, but the vegs were crisp n fresh, chicken tasted good  semi slow service line, just dragged   Im glad they were there though cause I needed a proper meal and not filler crap."}
{"text":"Should have looked at the ratings first...made a hasty choice - salty, greasy...your on your own...good luck!"}
{"text":"Food is OK, etastes a tad better than Panda. I ordered a Mongolian Steak bowl for 10.99, a little bit pricey but for Airport food it is alright. It is a better choice than hamburger at Burger King next door."}
{"text":"I usually love Pei Wei, but I've never seen such rude and miserable workers at the Vegas Airport location. Seeing as I have Celiacs disease and am unable to eat wheat, I asked if the Honey Chicken was breaded and the lady rudely snapped that EVERYTHING HERE IS BREADED. \"Even the Gluten Free Spicy Chicken?,\" I ask. She walks away and asks her unhappy coworkers and they all nod that yes, the GLUTEN FREE option is BREADED. GLUTEN=BREAD. It's really not that hard to understand. Really Pei Wei? Get your stuff together...."}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow service and almost missed my flight! One person cooks while three others stand around watching. Just awful!"}
{"text":"OMG this is the worst sushi I've had in my entire life. I'm going to throw it away and find another restaurant. Maybe they'll give me a refund.   Truly disgusting."}
{"text":"For an Asian diner, this is the most unfriendly toward vegetarian customers. No tofu, and extra charge to sub extra veggies or egg in place of meat/chicken."}
{"text":"Don't attempt to sit at the second row bar and try and order food and alcohol. You get ignored and then say they can't order food because it takes too much effort at this time. Great Customer Service Pei Wei! As a frequent business travel this is sad."}
{"text":"************** No Wei *************  Why ........I can never get excited about eating here.    The pot stickers ....... are always fried to \"DEATH\".       The entrees ......... are always SAUCE-LESS.           Vegetables ...... must be priceless ....... Zero to none in most entrees                Entrees ........ ALL TASTE ALIKE....excessive spiciness                     You can count on ......... your ENTIRE ORDER arriving at once ....                         meaning, soup, pot stickers and entree.   Oh Well ....... My Wife will allow me to avoid this disappointment for..... another  6 months.                                        Folk's ....... there's better out-there ..... THIS IS NOT THE WEI TO GO"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a good breakfast boritto when stuck on a layover. The rice they add to the standard bacon and eggs makes for a mild asian flavor. This stand is owned by pfchangs. The food quality isn't the same but its a notch above the standard fare. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The portions are small, the food is expensive, and the seating options could be pretty bad.  The only up-side to this place is that you can grab a beer before your flight.  The quality of the food isn't bad - but it's an airport.  They're charging you a lot for a little, and it's because they can get away with it.  Also the person who waited on me seemed grumpy, which I can understand given the setup they have there."}
{"text":"Disappointing franchise. I ordered my usual the won ton soup bowl with a side of rice. Since my last visit the size of the bowl was reduced and there were no veggies in the soup only broth and a few chicken won tons yet the price wasnt reduced.  They assume that since they are an airport monopoly that they can get away with doing whatever they want to do. If the consumer isn't happy who cares because the odds are slim that most of the consumers will ever return.  Pei Wei should review their franchise status but that isn't likely. They have a captive audience and probably outsell the average pei wei franchise. Your best bet is to purchase your food before you arrive at the airport and Carey it through security. This is allowed by every airline."}
{"text":"Unhelpful staff Brought noodle bowl with two spoons and advised if needed a fork or napkins they were around the corner  So I drag my luggage my noodle bowl and drink to go get a fork and some napkins"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice waiting for my flight and the food has been awful both times!!  Really bad compared to other Pei Wei's."}
{"text":"Wow!! I was impressed today. I went to Pei Wei after a busy day in Fountain Hills. I was a little disappointed that I couldn't find something better so I settled for Pei Wei. It was roughly 2pm and the place was pretty empty, so I was discouraged from the start. Well I started to order and the manager, who was taking my order, noticed I was struggling to find something tat looked good to me. So he asked us what we liked and disliked and made some recommendations. So we decided to go with those recommendations.   He brought our food out in less that 15 minutes. He noticed we had not yet grabbed silverware and brought us silverware, to-go boxes (just in case), and fortune cookies. A few more people started coming in and as he delivered their meals, he checked on us several times to make sure we enjoyed it. The service was easily a 5.  The meal was served hot and properly cooked. I ate the caramel chicken. I am usually not a fan of caramel chicken but this meal easily became my favorite Asian dish. This meal was great. The chicken was great, the rice was better cooked than usual, the veggies were fresh, and the sauce was unique but delicious. The mean was easily a 5.   I can not think of ONE negative thing to say about my experience here. Everything was great. My only complaint is I would have preferred a better fortune inside my cookie."}
{"text":"We were at the very last gate on this end so we were kinda out of options. I had the spicy kung p chicken, not terrible. Added fried rice as my side, and got a bottles soda. The food was ok, rice was a little dry for my liking. Total was almost $18 dollars, which is insane even for the airport.   The only thing keeping me from eating at the Burger King next to this place was the fact that I had bellied up on so much In-N-Out while I was in Vegas I couldn't stomach another burger."}
{"text":"I don't have high expectations of airport food, but the Chicken Teriyaki was sickenly sweet and overly salty."}
{"text":"We were hungry while waiting for our flight so we decided to give Pwi Wei a try. We ordered the Mandarin Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Steak. The food is extremely salty and greasy.  The only good thing about this place is it's made-to-order so you know the food the food hasn't been sitting there for hours."}
{"text":"Expect very very slow service. 20+ mins with no line! The patrons ahead of me said they only got their food after inquiring, we did the same and finally got ours. Sadly, this meant there wasn't much time to enjoy it. Airport fast food needs to be more timely."}
{"text":"40 min wait for a plate of chicken teriyaki...  I don't think these people understand that they operate in an airport."}
{"text":"I was starving and went Pei Wei - it was lame, here's why: SLOW cooking (this could mean it was fresher, though) NOT TASTY :(  Big portions were good, though!"}
{"text":"Long wait for tasty but lukewarm food. I should have gone to Panda Express in the next section instead. Lesson learned for next time."}
{"text":"I am SO MAD!! While finally getting a chance to eat my lunch I purchased at the PHX Airport, I am now in DFW Airport flipped the lettuce over and apparently there is an uninvited guess in my lunch. I have never experienced this before and it really ticked me off because I can't go back to the place for my money back!! I immediately contacted the Guest Services number on the site and they said this place is apart of the International crew so they will pass the message. This is VERY DISGUSTING and VERY UNSANITARY!!!! I really hope the manager reads these. This deserves a negative rating."}
{"text":"Dinner at the airport before my next flight and decided to try this place out. I ordered the Vegetarian Japanese Teriyaki bowl with fried rice.    My rice was drenched in their teriyaki sauce, I would ask for it on the side next time. Made me feel sick after eating a few bites of the drenched rice. It was like drinking teriyaki sauce by itself. Awful. Their vegetables were not cooked all the way through, the broccoli was chewy and not crisp.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Just don't.  Some airports offer good food.  Others don't.  You'd think one could find excellent Mexican food in the Phoenix airport.  This is what I settled for.  I'd rather go hungry than try it again.  To be fair, this was breakfast, but the eggs & bacon wrap I ordered left me feeling heavy for hours.  It just didn't work."}
{"text":"I requested the GLUTEN FREE chicken dish and stressed GLUTEN FREE.... they ended up giving me chicken that seemed like sweet and spicy chicken that was breaded. I asked the cashier lady if the chicken was gluten free and she said NO. I got home and felt TERRIBLE and sick. Do not trust that your food is going to be gluten free even if the menu says it will be gluten free and they tell you it's gluten free. Please make it a point to hire people who won't lie to the customers. If it was a deadly food allergy ... bad things would happen."}
{"text":"Really surprised by the low reviews for this  spot.   Pros: It's not your typical crapola airport spot.  It's not that much over regular Pei Wei prices (everyone airport spot raises prices by 10-20%...travel even fairly regularly and you should expect this) You don't have to question the meat source like at McDonalds or worse. Food actually tastes good.  Meat looks like meat, veggies look like veggies. Well packaged and plenty of napkins provided.  Cons: It's not $4. It's not as fast as a shitty fast-food burger. There isn't adequate waiting space for people, so you feel super awkward and like you're in everyone's way while waiting for your grub.  Wash: Super salt bomb...3x your daily recommended allotment but good to prompt you to replenish your body's non-alcohol fluid balance.    Honestly, I think the low reviews are because everyone is hung the F over and cranky as shit."}
{"text":"Price-wise -- it matches all the other over-priced places in the airport so I don't down-star for that aspect since they're all equally over-priced for the quality  Pros - they make it fresh to order unlike something like Panda Express where they scoop it out of the buffet line Taste wise the spicy chicken was OK - your typical Americanized \"Chinese food\" with sweet/spicy sour sauce on the battered chicken + rice/brown rice and sugar snap peas and carrots for $9.99 The wonton soup was tiny -- but actually quite tasty  Their service is pretty slow -- slowest fast food as my boyfriend described it. Upon ordering, waited almost 10 minutes for take-out. Caution if you're cutting it close to your flight"}
{"text":"For airport food I give Pei Wei a four stars but it would be closer to three outside the airport. We had the teriyaki chicken fried rice for $8.35 plus an extra &1.00 for the fried rice. It had a bunch of veggie, chicken and plenty of teriyaki sauce. The portion size is pretty solid and can be shared by two people if you aren't too hungry. The price isn't really that expensive compared to a $4 Greek yogurt or other extremely overpriced options.  The service seemed nice and it will take about ten minutes to order because it is made fresh so FYI if you are in a huge rush for your plane. They are open late until 11."}
{"text":"I was very happy to see Pei Wei open at the Airport. It was really a big deal. Since all the other Asian restaurants shut down there. Major disappointment. First of all ,only a few items to choose from. Which maybe is understandable, since they need quick food ready to go. However, it is mostly all the really fatty foods. So I got a salad that was pre made. High price, but I know it is the airport. I had to wait for the girl to come to ring me up. She was angry and not happy to be there, and way too  busy talking to the other workers there about their personal life.  That drives me crazy, plus I was the only one there at that moment. The 60 seconds that it takes to ring me up my order, should not take away from your personal chatter.  Plus I had to ask for a bag. When I did eat the salad it was full of white lettuce and the spine of the lettuce. Why do restaurants always do that now? The spine of the lettuce should never be in the salad! Ever!! I will say and mean it, I will never visit this place again in the Airport. Because, I really like Pei Wei normally."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a nice change from all the fast food places at the airport.  There are only beef and chicken hot entrees on the menu though - amongst the 8-10 options! You'd think there could at least be a seafood or tofu option too.   The display says 2 of the chicken dishes can be made \"vegetarian\" but I'm not sure if they'd only serve the rice with the sauce or replace the meat with tofu as well.  There are also chicken salads, wraps, banh mi's and rolls available to grab. I got a spicy tuna roll (6 to 8 pieces) as I wanted to keep it light. It was small and $10, which was more expensive than the hot entrees!   The beers were also $8/tiny bottle (the menu does not show the price)!  We spent $70 at Pei Wei for 4 people. Definitely not worth that price! Go but order carefully ;-)"}
{"text":"Stopped here during a layover. We ordered the Kung Pao chicken and Caramel Chicken. They were accommodating of my nut/gluten allergies but the food was extremely salty; we couldn't taste anything except the salt and almost threw it away. The prices are what I'd expect for the portion sizes in an airport, but too high for the low quality. Definitely didn't want all that sodium right before a long flight."}
{"text":"??????(???????????????)??????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????pei wei ??????????????????'EDAMAME' ????????????Oh Happy Day ???  ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Find something else, food was super greasy and tasted like the grill hasn't been cleaned for several orders."}
{"text":"Imagine the mounting tension and excitement of walking terminal C with enough time to find a sit down restaurant and enjoy a leisurely lunch before your flight.  Then PeiWei appears like an oasis in this desert of junk food.  This is such a great feeling.  They have a nearly full menu to choose from, also a great sign.    Well that concludes the good news.   The food was mediocre.  I got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  The veggies were barely ok, the chicken was as dry as the Sahara desert, and the rice would have had more water content before being cooked.  The massive quantities of sauce could not rectify the problems and instead added to unpleasantness of this meal.    The only things on par with a regular PW would be soda and fortune cookie.    I'd opt for the fast food if I were you.  Their low rating is sadly well earned."}
{"text":"Not very quick, but they sell a decent sized box of fried rice for $3! Great for staying on a travel budget if your willing to sacrifice the meat!"}
{"text":"Don't bother if you're in a hurry this place is extremely slow period twice in the last two days I've tried to order food while trying to connect to another flight and they were not able to prepare my food in 15 or 20 minutes. The food here is good but this service is extremely slow"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service at this location. Brandee the cashier took five minutes for every person trying to order. The staff were absolutely unhappy and slow. Pei Wei should pull this franchise from this owner. Absolutely terrible for their brand."}
{"text":"I decided to have lunch here and have a drink at the bar. I ordered my food and headed to the bar. A patron gave me her seat at the bar. No one acknowledged my presence. The male bartender was placing beer bottles in their fridge. The female was tending to other patrons, while I waited for her since the guy didn't bother with me. A male traveller takes the seat next to mine the male bartender gets up and asks HIM what's he's having. I voiced my objection since I was there first. The male bartender didn't apologize and proceeded to serve the other guy who came much later than me. The female bartender said she didn't see me. Funny I'm wearing a hot pink jacket that's hard to miss. Gender discrimination was obvious. I walked away not wanting to give them my business."}
{"text":"Food is microwave. Rice is hard as rock. They served me the wrong plate, I was eating thinking this is not what I expected yet it's ok and I'm hungry. Food runner then comes back and has a bit of an attitude, takes my plate and brings the correct one.  Plate was scorching hot one second and dead cold the next. Friggin microwave.   Did not finish my plate. Did not enjoy the food not the service. Lousy option at the airport. Won't be back again."}
{"text":"If you have a few extra minutes before your flight the breakfast fried rice is sooo tasty. However, it's made fresh so it can take a bit longer than to-go plane food."}
{"text":"While waiting for my flight, I was craving some Asian food so decided to try this place out.  It was okay. Reminds me of Panda Express.  Service was fine. Dining area was nice but small. I ordered the Mandarin Kung Pao chicken over white rice and it was a little too salty.  I like salty food but even this was too salty for me.  My friend had another chicken dish--can't remember the name, but it was better than mine.  The prices were a little high but it's expected since it's at the airport."}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Don't expect service.  Got a huge frown and attitude when I had the audacity to ask the server to bring me chop sticks.   She brought me a spoon to eat my meal with and nothing else. What?"}
{"text":"Just waited 40 minutes for our food.  And as if to throw salt in the wound, when I complained about the wait they immediately began giving food to those people who had only waited a few minutes.  Manager no where to be found.    DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE TO CATCH A PLANE - which of course everybody does at this location!!!"}
{"text":"This is good airport food.  It took forever, which is not optimal.  But, my chicken wrap was super tasty and made to order. It was very reminiscent of a fast food PF Changs."}
{"text":"Just ate at pei wei and I recommend you do not! It's gross. I ordered the caramel chicken and wasn't spicy even though it had the fire (indicating that it was spicy) by it. My cousin ate the kung pao and did not like it either. He says the quality of the chicken was not good. Took 25 minutes for our food! Wasn't even that busy.. Had never been here before but was disappointed."}
{"text":"I was there last Thursday at dinner time l.  The line to order was about 5min, but it took them 20 min to prepare two egg rolls.  Be careful ordering from here if you have a short layover."}
{"text":"We made a special request, so maybe we put them out of their element, but I didn't particularly like the dish we got.   My girlfriend and I weren't hungry enough to have our own dish so we decided to share one. She's vegetarian so we asked for the Beef Fried Rice with the beef on the side. The rice was good but the beef mostly tasteless. Didn't taste seasoned at all. I wonder if that has anything to do with our special request? Or if they rely solely on the rice providing the flavor? I would hope that they also season their meat too.  Eh, OK place."}
{"text":"I just ordered Thai Wonton soup (Bowl) for $6.99. I was surprised to see only 4 small wontons in big container. Wow!!!!"}
{"text":"Have not had any food yet but holy crap the girl at the cashier is the worst I have ever encountered"}
{"text":"Was a little later than I usually am to make a flight out east. I needed to eat and should have grabbed a pre-made salad or something. Decided against my gut instinct but how hard could it be to make chicken grid rice and a couple egg rolls?   Well lesson learned!  My pork egg rolls were swimming in oil. Like they were pull out of the fryer and not even drained. As a matter of fact they might have even spooned in some oil for good measure.  Couldn't even eat them.   Chicken fried rice looks ok but the rice is sticky and mooshy.  Oh and did I mention this was supposed to be chicken fried rice, guess what they left out the chicken!!  At least my fortune cookie is fresh!"}
{"text":"Ehhh... not many late flight choices. You would think the vegas airport would have some better options. Only had the wonton soup but the bowl was half full!!! So not really a bowl- very small portion and not much substance to it. Still hungry but reviews don't look safe enough to order anything else. Nice staff though. No complaints there. Good service and a place to sit and eat near bar which helps!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys, but this was one of the few restaurants I ever got sick from the food. Had Montezuma's revenge for 4 days. Will never go back. Too bad, some of the items were really tasty.,"}
{"text":"Worst Pei Wei ever...I would give no stars if able. Large wanton soup is now a small, but at the same price as the large. White rice was old and crusty brown. When I asked for fresh rice the \"cook\" spoke obsenties under her breath that I could hear while the other workers just looked on. Customer service was condescending and not engaged. Why does airport food always have to be gross and overpriced?"}
{"text":"Is it good food, not really.  Is it great food considering you need something quick on your layover, hell yeah!  Its mediocre cheap Chinese food.  It is what it is."}
{"text":"Very good quality Chinese fusion food from the creators of P.F. Chang's and a fresh and very hot food option at the airport! Just make sure you have at least an hour during your layover at this airport as it may take over 10 minutes for your food to arrive.  We ordered the chicken lo mein and kung pao chicken during a 1.5 hour layover in Vegas. This location is perfect when you're traveling on Southwest Airlines between the B and C terminals. There are a few good options between B and C (including Nathan's hot dogs and sandwiches, Wendy's, an Italian place, Starbucks) but this is by far the best as the food is piping hot and fresh.  Portion size was very good for our $10.95 entrees -- a very good value. We could have split one entree to hold us over but enjoyed the two entrees with a little bit of leftovers.   I wish they had the dan dan noodles at this airport location, but instead they have only over a half dozen entree options (caramel chicken, honey chicken, kung pao, etc) that come with white or brown rice. If you need a small bite though, they have lettuce wraps for $8.50, crispy spring rolls and small/regular Thai wonton soup.  They also sell California rolls with mango in the refrigerated case for $11 each, not as good a deal."}
{"text":"Not sure if I ever tried them before as they are not found in my area but I had been craving some good noodles forever and saw a guy walk past me with them.  They looked Yummy! and so did the lettuce wraps.  I bit the bullet at an airport to purchase these Lo Mein noodles and they tasted as good as they looked.  Everything is cooked to order so it is hot and fresh.  I ordered bottled water to the tune of almost 5 bucks! The meal was only $9.99!  So I am dinging a star for the dang water.  Yeah I know airport prices are higher than normal but c'mon $4.59 for a 20 oz. smart water???  Food was on point and wish I could go again.  Much better than Panda Express.  Service was average."}
{"text":"3 stars:  Stopped by the airport for a two-hour layover and my friends and I were hungry...the past weekend we had eaten primarily American food, so we were craving Asian food.  Well, Pei Wei Asian diner is the only \"Asian\" option at the airport.  Ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and the total cost was about $10...expensive, especially since the portion is small.  There were a lot of customers there too, and although there are many chefs, it took awhile to get the food out.  However...upon my first bite, I was in trouble.  Peanuts.  I am severely allergic to peanuts, so I accidentally nibbled on a peanut (I was very hungry...didn't look).  I rushed back to the counter and checked the menu to see if they had listed peanuts in the description.  There was no indication of peanuts.  As someone who has a severe peanut allergy, I found this to be disturbing, because there many other people who have more severe peanut allergies, so it could have been much worse.  You may be wondering, \"Why then are you giving Pei Wei a 3 star rating?\"  When I brought my food back and told them I couldn't eat the Kung Pao chicken (and told them that it wasn't indicated in the menu description), the manager said no problem to getting me another order of a different menu item without peanuts.  I really respect the fact they gave me another order, no extra charge."}
{"text":"This was the worst pedi wei I've ever had.  I had the kung pao chicken and it was more like kung pao leather.  There was more breading than meat.  The runner was in a miserable mood as well."}
{"text":"When dining in an airport, there are a few things I look for...  1) A restaurant/food stop that has tables with seating. Ain't nobody tryin' to hang out in those seats at the terminal for an hour.  2) Either a TV for my viewing pleasure, or an outlet to charge my phone/computer. Both would be great, but only one is necessary.  3) Decent food that's not ridiculously bad for you!  I'm happy to report that Pei Wei Asian Diner met all three of my requirements. Sure, our meals were way over priced, but that's airport dining for ya. The hubs and I grabbed a booth/table combo with an outlet right underneath - perfect for charging our computers before our flight. Service was friendly and the food was pretty good.  You place your order up at the counter then they give you a buzzer to let you know when it's ready. I'd say our food took about 5 minutes to come out. Not too shabby. I got the egg and bacon fried rice which I really enjoyed. It was a large bowl of food. My husband and I honestly could have split it.   A good place to keep in mind for a meal at the Las Vegas airport!"}
{"text":"The chicken teriyaki was overcooked, overseasoned and very oily. The mongolian beef is okay for an airport food."}
{"text":"Whoa. Bacon egg and sausage fried rice..... What..... Now of the pei weis in so cal have this. Super delicious too! This location is near gate e10. Quick and friendly service.  Lots lf seating so u can gobble it all down before taking off. Adjacent to burger King."}
{"text":"Located near gate 20. I got the fried rice.. Tasted good.. Asked for it to be spicy. Can be hard to find a seat as its in a food court area and all seating is shared."}
{"text":"I echo the others - service is very, very slow. It took 16 minutes for a simple dish, during a not very busy time.  I ordered Chicken Chow Mein - which is actually Chicken Lo Mein, but who's counting?  It was very hot and very filling, was a good meal before hopping on a long flight."}
{"text":"If there were negative stars I'd pick that. They have a rodent problem.  Don't EVER eat there. Even heard 2 of the airport cleaners talking about it. *barf* Don't do it to yourself!!"}
{"text":"Only tried the chicken lettuce wraps (3 stars) and they were pretty good. Reminds me of the chain PF Changs, not authentic, but still has flavor. Lettuce was fresh too, no bad wilted lettuce in the bunch. Definitely over priced but everything in the airport is.   This was the only place near my gate where I could get something that wasn't pre-made or sitting out all day. Plus I was trying to find something a little healthier, but it's probably not that healthy, haha.   Service: Staff was nice. Line goes pretty fast and food comes out in 5 minutes.  Atmosphere: Clean, they have seats between the ordering stand and bar area. Tables and stools for the high top tables, so if you're alone it's easy to find a seat."}
{"text":"Airport fast food... Worst food I ever tried! The \"steak\" I ordered here was a few overfried pieces of meat with some greens overgreesed with horrible oil that smells and tastes like old machine oil, and i really hope i am not going to die tonight. The brown rice was a clump of overboiled texture resembling barley, so i am not sure it is even rice."}
{"text":"Do not let the PF Chang's ownership fool you into believing their cuisine is any better than Panda Express. Essentially it's the same thing but at a higher price and slower service. And with Panda setting the bar very low for Chinese food,  Pei Wei is subterranean on the quality scale.   Specifically, the dishes are extremely salty, way too sweet and greasy. Yes, that's the definition of American cooking. But it still sucks. And rounding out their Americana - they deep fry the Kung Pow'ed chicken. I guess with a few token snow peas mixed with the fried rice, this fast food appears more Hoity-Toity than a Swanson Oriental TV Dinner from Walmart, but don't be fooled by marketing and mid-range pricing."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome customer service, right around the block and super convenient to get to!"}
{"text":"Service: (not many people in line) register people were not very friendly, kind of the \"give me your order & money, next!\" vibe.   Food: I got the chicken lettuce wrap and it was actually pretty good and filling. It came in a sectioned box with meat/filling in one section, lots of lettuce in another, and the sauce in the other. It also came with a fortune cookie. I liked the seasoning, but it was slightly more oily than I would've expected."}
{"text":"Better than Panda, we had the caramel chicken, spicy and good, but the chicken was a bit dry, brown rice was good.  Not bad for airport food"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets when you're at McCarran airport. Yes its pricey ($10 for a main, $4 for a bottle of water), and yes its Chinese food suited for American tastebuds (meats lathered in sweetness), but its way better than the other dining options in the terminal. This place might only deserve 2 to 3 stars as compared to food on the vegas strip, but in the airport it reigns supreme.  I had an hour before my flight out and was so sick of burgers. Had the caramel chicken at Pei Wei and it was fantastic, really hit the spot.  By the way, Pei Wei is by P.F. Chang's, so its not like some rando panda express."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try Pei Wei, but there normally just isn't one close to me. When we had 15 minutes before our flight was boarding, I somehow still convinced the husband we could swing it. When we were up, I asked the cashier how long it would take for a honey shrimp. I was happy that she took the time to ask the manager just to be sure.. and she told us 10 minutes. We paid extra for the fried rice and planned to split the entree between us. 10 minutes for our order to be up was spot on! Super happy for the quick turnaround and they even put plenty of napkins and enough silverware in the bag. Score. Now we get to be those jerks on the plane with the delicious smelling food. Ha! The honey shrimp was SO good. It has been awhile since I've been to a P.F. Chang's, but I would only order the crispy honey shrimp there and this was, I believe, the exact same (they are owned by the same company). Delicious and cooked to order. Loved it! A great, quick find in an airport and a happy change from candied nuts and McDonald's!"}
{"text":"I give them four stars on a curve as airport Chinese food is usually not very good. The best dishes here are the entrees, not sushi or banh mi sandwiches - really this is a stir fry kind of place.  I had the Kung pao chicken which was very flavorful and lots of white meat. Also had a good amount of freshly cooked veggies (carrots and snap peas) which can be tough to find in an airport. It was fairly salty but I have to admit I like salty. Brown rice is great to make things a little healthier."}
{"text":"Limited menu in terms of the usual Pei Wei offerings, however, still its delicious self!   The food came out very quickly which is extremely important in an airport with everyone usually on a time crunch. We had 20 minutes till boarding and the food came out in 10! Perfect. They do have a small seating area and a bar so that's cool!  Everything was hot and delicious,and the portions were good. I'm very glad I chose this over the other options in the airport."}
{"text":"An Asian restaurant that can't serve steamed rice!  Hard and dry. The mongolian beef was worse. The meat was over cooked and the mushrooms not cooked, the sauce wasn't Asian. The bar tender was too busy hiting on a chick to bring me chopsticks or a fork. A new low in airport food."}
{"text":"Super tasty food, I really enjoyed the food and would stop by LAS just to come here.  I had the wonton soup and the chicken wraps.  Both made with fresh ingredients.  Nicely done Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"This looked like the best food option in terminal 4. I'm glad I chose it. I am a vegetarian and the cashier girl was very friendly and helpful and gave me great options not listed on the menu. The food was cooked to order (you can see them so you know it's fresh). It tastes great and the food was brought out to me at the table. Great service and great food and at a great affordable price."}
{"text":"I was hungry and ordered the Original Pei Wei chicken with chow menu noodles.  Not good and not happy with the taste if left in my mouth!  It looks much better than it tasted!"}
{"text":"I had a 45 min. layover in Vegas.  I used the restroom then wanted to grab a quick bite.  First food place I came across was Pai Wei.  I ordered and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Noticed that my flight was boarding.  People who were behind me in line started receiving their food.  Asked a person who I was flying with to put my bag on the plane and that I would be there in a minute.  I waited some more.  Finally I went to the counter and the cashier asked to see my ticket.  Somehow, my order was never submitted.  They prioritized my meal and I grabbed it and ran to my gate, which was 30 seconds away.  The airline had just closed the gate and couldn't let me on.  Thanks to the snails pace and the incompitence of Pal Wei, I missed my flight.  I give 2 stars for quality of food and 0 for efficiency.  The only place that I'd eat at Pal Wei again would be in hell!"}
{"text":"The prices for sushi is ridiculous and from what I saw they only had two rolls available. Spicy tuna and California roll, 8.99! Jesus, those 2 rolls should never be over $6   Ordered the Thai wonton soup and it was good. Loved the spinach and scallions that came along with it. Although, it was a lot of broth and maybe only 5 small wontons in the soup. Small dish but it was tasty."}
{"text":"I'm an employee at the airport and I tried pei wei for the first time yesterday.I ordered the spicy chicken entree and 2 eggrolls. Super expensive. The eggrolls were a little odd tasting so I thought maybe its just the seasoning or something. A few hours later I'm in the bathroom retching. I will never eat here again . The only good thing about this location in the high a gates was the lady who took my order was very nice. Very disappointed . Please stop serving tainted food."}
{"text":"When there's nothing else good to eat at the airport, you come here. It's so-so to stop your hunger. I ate rice mostly that came with my spicy chicken and hubby got king pao chicken. I heard Pei Wei's parent company is PF Chang. The food of the two are, of course, very different. The last time I had PF Chang's dish was a long time ago and I remembered it was pretty good but this Pei Wei is meant for \"stop over\" customers. Not big a deal. Eat here if you have to, so you don't go hungry later."}
{"text":"Grrrrrrrrrrrr  Bacon Fried rice with egg  I know.... Ain't close to Hawaii or even loft but dude!!!!!!    Can you use dry rice instead of wet par cooked rice.... If I wanted rice porridge or congee.... I woulda drove to Chinatown .....  $12 plus tax with a diet coke bottle......  Serves me right.....  I know better , but I didn't listen to my brain .....    Just god awful....."}
{"text":"As I continue to travel travel travel I stopped in for a quick bite before my 6hr flight. If you like Pei Wei it has all of the right notes from non-airport locations.  The service was good and the servers were very respectful. I had the Fried rice with steak and it was delicious. The terminal is rather large so there are plenty of places to eat but if you are in the mood, it is a good choice. There is a TV by the bar.  Note: So they have sushi on the menu but you pick it up in a pre-fab container when you walk in. I barely can stand supermarket sushi, but airport sushi? If you are brave enough, you will have to let me know!"}
{"text":"My bf told me last time we were in Vegas we came to eat before our flight.. but I just couldn't remember..   No excuse here, I don't remember because the food was probably not that special.  We ordered Japanese teriyaki chicken and spring roll. The chicken tastes like fried chicken breast with a sugar glaze. We did not even finish the whole thing. Every bite is like a candy.  It is the only Asian restaurant tho."}
{"text":"Extremely slow. Terrible customer service. Paid $12 for pie wei chicken that had 2 pieces in it. Would have been better off booking a flight to Asia to eat."}
{"text":"I love going here.   It was an early morning stop but for me it was 2 hours later and I wanted lunch. Luckily they were serving!  Chicken fried rice.  And a lot of it !! You could easily get a couple of egg rolls and share this meal with a friend!"}
{"text":"It's hard to give a fair review of a fast food joint in an airport. You're traveling, you're stressed, you're sleep deprived sometimes......you may stink. So, any experience at a restaurant may not be as bad as you perceive it in those conditions. This location was nothing special, but there wasn't much bad about it either. You ordered, paid, and received your food quickly. Nothing complicated. The food was hot and fresh. It was your typical fast food, Americanized, Chinese food. Delicious!   This place gave me a chance to recharge my electronics and myself. I'll probably eat here again if given a chance, depending on my mood."}
{"text":"Bad, even for airport food. There are very few options on the menu, so I ordered the chicken fried rice. It was disgusting - the vegetables were mushy and the rice was completely drenched in soy sauce. The rice was so salty that it was inedible. Anywhere else in the airport will be better."}
{"text":"Not bad. Better than Panda Express -- but a few times more expensive. If you're at the airport and desperate, your options are limited anyway. Maybe go to a buffet beforehand, especially if you're flying into SFO because if there is fog, they will likely be a delay. Prep accordingly!"}
{"text":"The checker let 2 people cut in line.  On top of that they have a very limited menu and no ice tea.  Avoid this place like the plague!!!!"}
{"text":"The rudest and filthiest staff ever at the airport.  Kept telling everyone it's going to be a long wait then I get to register and they decided to cut of sales!  Lazy undereducated filthy mouth did I say lazy staff?  Whoever runs this location should be fired!"}
{"text":"Hungry before you get on flight.  All I can say get some bacon fried rice . It will fill you up."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed going to Pei Wei for several years now, ever since PF Chang started  rolling out the concept nationally.   The food is really good and the selection from different Asian cultural foods is outstanding -- they serve Thai, Korean, and of course Chinese.  If you have never been to a Pei Wei think Panda Express with a more upscale menu and  a sit-down atmosphere for a modest price.  A good example was our dinner last evening.  We came in around 5 pm, there was already a dozen or so patrons there.  We ordered their new three choice combo meal and soup and the bill came in for less then $20.00.  One of the managers came by to check if everything was prepared to liking and everything was delicious.   Nice!  Go!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food looks colorful. We ordered lo mein chick and caramel chicken, both extra spice. The caramel chicken was too spicy.  They Thai wonton soup bowl tasted pretty good, it came with spinach and only 5 wontons.   The service was good though and they were very helpful with utensils."}
{"text":"Forget getting anything good to eat on an airplane these days. Nice to see real food that's fresh and not prepackaged at an airport. The wait for our chicken & veggie rice bowls was short. Ten minutes max. Not greasy and filling to carry us over until we got to our next destination. I would eat here again when traveling through the Vegas or any airport for that matter."}
{"text":"I knew when I landed in Housto it'd be too late to get decent food and likely too sketchy (flying into Hobby at midnight isn't a place you'd wanna hang out) anyways, the line to order moved quickly. Most of the employees looked miserable but thats pretty normal for Monday. My food was brough to me quickly. The resturant had a relaxing vibe."}
{"text":"I came here due to desperation and thought it would be the fastest since the line was short. I waited for a good 10 minutes until I got my food, then proceeded to run to Gate B which took another 10 minutes. Geez why are the gates so far apart? I got onto the plane and realized the teriyaki sauce spilled all over the bag. Now I have to deal with sticky hands for the next while. Eek."}
{"text":"We stopped in here in Nov 2016.    I like the cook to order menu, lots of interesting things to choose from.  As other reviewers note, cook to order means you will wait a little.  We ordered water (remember this is free) with our meals.  We had Honey Seared Chix and the Lo mein, not a big serving, but enough.  We both enjoyed our meals.  Not sure how this qualifies as 'asian fusion', but whatever.  For $10.39/single entree/starch, this is a little out there, but we're in an airport.  Two eggrolls were $4.99.  They were kinda ok, at least they werent swimming in grease.  I wouldnt order again.  Sadly everything is served in plastic containers, and there is no recycling option (we did take ours home to 'reuse') -1star for cruelty to environment.  If you MUST eat in the airport, this isnt a bad choice."}
{"text":"Every drink here is $10+. That's not the selling point of Pei Wei in the airport. Let me tell you why I think this hot spot is the place to be when you wait for your flight.  The bar.  That's right. Janice...and now Cindy, are the reasons why I'll ever come back here again...and every time I come to the Vegas airport. Even the one guy (didn't get his name) wished me a personal farewell as if he was sad to see his customers go. Now, I have an emotional connection to Pei Wei. No other bar and restaurant in the Vegas airport will remember you came two months ago and said something but these folks. There's something truly sweet about that.  The fact that a bartender pointed to the exact seat I sat in months ago and asked how my career has progressing (yes, she got it right), tells me...even in an international airport, an Asian fast food bar still has a personal touch. Keep it up, you guys. You made one customer leave with a smile today."}
{"text":"Before our flight we decided to get a drink at the bar. This was a Monday night & it didn't seem too busy.   The bartender seemed busy & we decided to sit down & wait & wait & wait & wait!!!! He kept glancing at us quickly but he wanted to finish what he was doing before he moved onto the. next order BUT we didn't even have drink menus. He could have gave us those menus while he was finishing another order. It was just awful. Service definitely failed. I wish I got his name but he really shouldn't be behind the bar by himself if he can't handle a bar.    We waited for 4 drinks & it took him more than 8 mins to make. Sorry pal, no tip."}
{"text":"Pros and Cons.  Pros:  ?Taste is mixed with Japanese and chinese. I think Americans also like it.   ?Portion is neutral. For me too much. It took 20mins to finish. For normal Americans ?not too big, not too small?, it might be fine.   ?Price is neutral. Not bad, not too cheap.   ?Quick serving.  Cons:   ?Staffs were not friendly. I was treated as like a machine.   ?Smelling. When you bring it to your flight, be carefull. The smell of garlic is strong You SHOULD eat when it becomes cold.  Totally, I rate this restaurant 4 stars."}
{"text":"As far as Japanese Teriyaki goes, this was pretty well made. The ratio of oil is not overwhelming and the meat is tender. When you put that on a bed of brown rice, the result is a completely pleasant meal. I didn't think that the service was in any deficit."}
{"text":"The rice was microwaved in the plastic container before they piled the veggies on. This food is going to give me cancer."}
{"text":"The regular Pei Wei is pretty much crap.  They used the same sauce for every dish.  It taste ok, but the same flavor for all the dish type is unimaginative and kind of idiotic.  This one is a small walk up counter in the airport.  It;s  worst than a regular restaurant. What was I thinking?"}
{"text":"Fail. tried to get something not sweet. can I get the chicken grilled instead of fried and breaded? sure thing this isn't sweet at all\" took one bite ridiculously sweet. should have scrutinized the other dishes more carefully- they all looked shiny and completely drenched in unappetizing sauces. watched the kitchen keep making errors about things you'd think would be important like peanuts. took it back for a refund. had to wait basically the time I had to eat for a mgr to come from one of the other locations to refund my card. fail"}
{"text":"Airport food sucks. It's nearly impossible to find a decent meal that hasn't been sitting there for days, but this Pei Wei is pretty decent.  The staff is nice as friendly, the fridge is stocked with many varieties of water, beer, juices and sandwiches. The sandwiches and sushi looked just ok though, so I opted for chicken lettuce wraps.  I paid $15 for those and a fancy looking bottle of water and they were tasty! The lettuce was crispy and fresh, the chicken just a bit overseasoned, the chestnuts crunchy. I would have preferred peanut sauce to the spicy one they serve, but overall that was a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Let's face it.. One should not have high expectations for airport food, but Pei Wei at the airport wasn't too shabby, but it wasn't that good either.  I was looking for vegetables--something fresh, something alive and somewhat healthy to put into my body.  My mom and I opted for Asian since we are Asian and enjoy Asian food or pseudo-Asian food that tries. And I have to say, Pei Wei Asian Diner \"tries\" but it's just not that good. Perhaps that's why I've never eaten at any of their locations before this experience.  Basically, we ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps with citrus soy sauce, red onions, red bell peppers, scallions, cilantro, mint and iceberg lettuce & the Caramel Chicken with a tangy caramel chile sauce, pineapple, ginger, garlic, lemongrass, mint, rice sticks, topped with a crisp Asian slaw (about $20 plus tax for the two meals). Instead of any rice side, I asked for more veggies and I have to say that they did pile on a ton of veggies for me.   Overall, both dishes just seemed a bit too salty for my taste buds and the flavors were seriously lacking in the Caramel Chicken dish as well as the lettuce wraps.  I did give them an additional star for the extra fresh vegetables piled on my plate and decent service; however, it's just not worth spending $20+ on lunch even in an airport for overly salted food that didn't really taste Asian anything. Felt like a waste. Sad to say, but I should have just gone with fast food instead.  :("}
{"text":"I expected Asian food to be salty, it's a known fact, but WOW!! I needed a whole bottle of water to keep eating and after white rice, a cupcake and cookie, I still feel like I'm in the ocean. Salt the the Max! Credit comes where it is due though. There was a long line because other restaurants had already closed (prior to 8pm) and Pei Wei was open and prompt. They were cranking orders out quickly and efficiently.  Frankly, just glad to have a full belly while I wait for the next plane."}
{"text":"This review is strictly based off of the chicken banh mi sandwich.  The banh mi is pre made and cold. They won't even heat it for you.  You're better off getting a sandwich from Starbucks since they will at least toast it for you.  Taste wise the chicken banh mi tastes like a sriacha flavored tuna sandwich with pickled veggies.    My advice to you is to eat elsewhere or save your $8 for a legit $5 banh mi at Lees sandwiches or another mom and pops pho place that sells Vietnamese sandwiches."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is one of the better tasting options in the Las Vegas airport.    It's not on the menu but if you don't want your chicken deep fried (General Tso's, for instance) and totally unhealthy, you can go for a non-fried version.  Just ask.  Everything is cooked to order, so it may take a few minutes to get your food, but that's a small price to pay for decent airport take away food."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to Asian food so when at the airport, this place appealed to me the most.  It's not amazing, but it's not bad.  Got the bacon and egg fried rice, which has the sweet tangy flavor of Thai food.  Not amazing, but not bad neither.  Also got the wonton soup.  Good wontons.  Soup is ok.  And also had a pork egg roll.  The skin was not very crispy, a little tough.  Ingredients were ok.  If you're craving Asian food while at the airport, it's a good option."}
{"text":"Unlike other reviews, my order came out fast.  Service was okay... after all it is at the airport.   The prices are only a dollar or two more than offsite.  Gave it 3 stars because the Mongolian beef was okay but no way close to offsite places."}
{"text":"The food is just ok.  A little overpriced for what you get.  I ordered a Mongolian Chicken, but got a Mongolian Beef instead.  The receipt clearly states chicken on the receipt (as photographed).  People are paying good money for the food and the place is crowded, yet they didn't turn on the AC.  I was sweating just waiting for my food.  While I was there, I didn't see them wipe any tables.  Just customers go, customer sits down.  The top it off, looks like the manager didn't even bother perfecting the receipt.  there's a line that says \"Enter Website Here\" on the 4th line of the receipt.  Manager that cares about details is essential to a business' success.  I guess this one lives off of people that crave chinese food before they fly"}
{"text":"Had the Kung Pao chicken. Expensive for the size. A few small pieces of chicken and tons of rice.  Also need more vegies and less sodium."}
{"text":"They have two gluten free options on their menu at this airport location. Which is better than any other place in the Vegas airport.  Small place, the line moves fast but your actual food order does not. I almost missed my boarding while I was there waiting on my meal.   It takes about 15-20 minutes for your food to come, whether you get it to go or are sitting.  Prices are pretty standard for food, drinks are crazy. I got my meal and a powerade, the meal was $9 and some change, the powerade was $3.99-YIKES! Staff was nice-efficient.  I would get this food again if I had a lay over in the Vegas airport."}
{"text":"Love Pei Wei. This airport location was super busy, and crowded. It was hard to find a seat. Luckily I was by myself, so I found a seat facing the airport walkway, kinda like a bar table. Anyways, food was good. I had the Mongolian beef and a soda. It's the airport, very pricey, so be prepared to pay almost fifteen bucks for a meal like that!   All in all, it's what I was in the mood for, so it was worth it cause I was hungry too!  Btw, the restaurant has a full bar with TVs as well."}
{"text":"I am used to really good food from Pei Wei when I find one, so I chose to eat here before my flight. I wish I had chosen something else. The Kung Pao was bland and lacked any spice that it should, not to mention it was extremely salty. The staff was curt and one rolled her eyes when she brought me my drink that I had left at the register. The only redeeming thing was that there was no line. Try something else."}
{"text":"At the airport, food should be ready. What I wanted had a 5 minute wait. What I ordered took 10. I think any time food is fried, it should say it in the description. I don't like fried food. Got kung pow chicken, which is fried, but the menu description doesn't say that. So salty it's almost inedible. The snap peas are good - all 8 of them. The menu does indicate this is spicy, but it's not at all. Hey, Pei Wei - people who don't like spicy won't be ordering this. People that do will, so live by your little chili indicator."}
{"text":"The lo mein is fresh. The chicken was a little dry but I don't usually eat the chicken anyway. Great for the type fast/ chain of place that it is."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Pei Wei about 15 times in Texas and it's always been amazing. Dont expect the same food and service here. We ordered Honey seared chicken with edimame. It was overly priced (normal for the airport) but absolutely horrible quality. The chicken was undercooked. Wouldn't call it seared at all. The brown rice was way under cooked and hard. When I informed them their brown rice was hard they look disgusted that I would inform them of it then offered white rice. The edimame which seems like what would be the hardest thing to mess up was cold and gross. I'm sure I'll eat at Pei Wei again but definitely not this one. Don't waste your money here. We couldn't even finish our food."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared the Kung Pao chicken and the portion was a perfect size. The flavor of the chicken was wonderful, spicy yet tangy. I was pleasantly surprised how good it was for airport food.   The staff seemed like a bunch of zombies but they were really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Bad food, even by airport Chinese food standards.   Good points are that the food appears to be clean and the staff is friendly.   Bad news is that the food tastes oily and bland. The lo mein is oddly sweet.   Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place 1 star because it was the cause of one of the worst plane rides I ever had. I feel like the fried rice at Panda Express is better than this place, and the chicken to rice ratio although was a bit too generous to my liking. The broccoli was raw and not cooked either. Plus, this fried rice caused me into one of the most uncomfortable plane rides of my life! I was getting a cold sweat because I wanted to throw up but obviously did not want to succumb, and I was lucky I didn't.  Airport food though... what can you expect? Go opt in for Popeyes instead."}
{"text":"Solid 3 maybe a bit higher. Late nite in terminal c it sure beats fast food. Steak fried rice is pretty good with a cold Singha beer. Note, this is a twenty, but it tastes pretty good for airport food."}
{"text":"I don't think I will ever eat at Pei Wei again, not because of the service (which was terrible- took 15 min to make a chicken fried rice dish) but because the veges that came with were basically RAW. I had RAW snow peas in COOKED chicken (DRY as hell too) with asian sauces and cooked carrots. That just made it taste horrific. The spicy chicken was overly dry, there were only like 5 pieces of it anyway. I was expecting it to be at least as good as some generic kung pao Americanized chicken drenched in artery clogging goodness but no this was just a dry + small portions of artery clogging disaster. It just tasted old too.  Not to mention I paid about 10$ for this, I much rather have 2 items from the McD dollar menu, which also would have been served in the fraction of the time.  If you're ever deciding between Pei Wei and Panda Express, ALWAYS go Panda. Christ."}
{"text":"This was my dinner on my out of Vegas, so I wanted something hearty to get me through the next 4-5 hours, and Pei Wei was just what I was looking for.  I ordered the Mongolian beef which included white mushrooms along with the traditional scallions, and I opted for brown rice over white.  I also ordered a pork egg roll.  The Mongolian beef was tasty, and I really liked the texture of the mushrooms, firm but tender.  The pork in the egg roll was ground and not crumbly which made it a lot easier to eat; it was a winner.  For me, this food is on par with PF Chang's - solid but not the most exciting Asian food.   I ordered my food to go because I had only a short time before boarding and the restaurant was very crowded.  I felt like the wait (10 min or so) was reasonable given how busy it was; the line was 10 people deep when I got in it and it was still at that number when I left. The people I encountered (including a manager who had to fix my slightly bungled order) were polite.    The seating area is relatively small but it is an airport, and there is a bar and who doesn't live a bar?!  I bumped my review up by a star because if I had seen the overall rating before I decided to eat there I might have skipped Pei Wei and that would have been awful because my experience was not negative in any way.    Yelp 100 #11"}
{"text":"When traveling, you usually know what you are going to get.  Moderately okay food at rediculously high prices.  Well at Pei Wei, you will get pretty dang good for rediculously high prices.    We got the Pei Wei (say pee wee, the lady at the counter is less than thrilled with that little bit of fun) spicy chicken and the Fried Rice Beef.  The chicken wasnt very spicy but it was good.  Served with steamed brown rice, this was actually enough for both of us without another meal.  The rice was also good and the portion was plenty.  If this wasn't in an airport, I'd give it 5 stars.  Add some seating and lower the price and I'm never going anywhere in the Vegas airport."}
{"text":"So good! Food is so hot and totally worth it. Made to order and I choose this place over a Panda Express or some other sh* Americanized Asian food place.  The food is fusion between japanese, Thai and Chinese. But it's worth it and this location shuts it down on all it's surrounding food locations.  Try it. Very cheap and very hot food served to your table"}
{"text":"I mean all airport food is pretty costly but it was hot and fresh. The customer service was solid it's pretty much an overall solid quick bite to eat spot not the same as going to a stand alone Pei Wei's, the menu is limited (no orange chicken) but a good experience nonetheless."}
{"text":"For $12 I was expecting a bit more. I ordered the Mongolian steak and it was really salty. It included a bit of green onions but it wasn't even chopped. This is as basic as it gets but it wasn't very tasty either. Should have gone to the Burger King next door."}
{"text":"Terrible AF. Unhelpful waiters. Terrible and most probably serving stale food. Not sure how these outlets are even surviving. Save yourself some money by visiting other restaurants."}
{"text":"Nothing on the menu is lower calories other than just a salad. Ordered the Kung pao chicken which at most Asian restaurants is a decent choice but not here because the chicken is breaded and deep fried.  It's my own fault for not asking ahead of time. It didn't even taste like Kung pao chicken, just kinda bland and greasy.  Lots of other choices at this airport so will not be back."}
{"text":"Before I purchased, I asked the cashier what time will my order (2 meals -kung pao and spicy wei) be ready as I have a flight in one hour. She said it will be \"in ten minutes.\" So i put my order in. I was waiting on the counter standing. I was asked 3 times by different staff what I ordered. My order did not arrive til almost 20minutes later! I saw them scrambling for my order. It sounded like they got my spicy wei order wrong; it wasnt spicy or they forgot to add spicy sauce..I was visibly upset and they apologized but i had to run to my departure gate!"}
{"text":"For starters, the place is filthy and most of the staff look like they hate their jobs. That should have been enough to warn me off eating here, but, tired from travel, I took a chance. Big mistake. They serve a number of variations of the same \"general tso's\" style chicken formula, coated in corn starch, quickly fried and then covered in sauce. In addition to not being particularly authentic (not that I was expecting authenticity at a Pei Wei), the flavor combinations were not particularly good. It was hard just getting all of it down, but, when you need to eat....  On a side note, no iced tea? What? How is that even possible?"}
{"text":"Not my favorite restaurant, but the best/healthiest option at the airport. Friendly employees. Fast, good food. But should a bottle of water cost as much as the food?!"}
{"text":"This is an OK sports bar at McCarran Airport with a decent selection of food.  However this review is bar only.  Have to say the service sucked,  Janice the bar tender's \"don't give a shit\" attitude was bi-polarly matched by her enthusiasm to talk when people engaged her.  The only problem with this is that not only was she blissfully unaware that people in airports are often in a rush to speed drink before their plane takes off and that people although engage in conversation with you, when they lean forward waving their arms a bit it usually mean shut up talking and pour me a drink quick.   This was compounded by her ability to walk slower between pours than anyone I have ever seen.  I could have drunk three drinks in the time it took her to pour one.  Don't want to lose the gal her job but please managers, light a fire under there!"}
{"text":"Definitely not your normal airport food.  It's really good food, not just \"good for airport food\".  Entrees are individually cooked to order.  I had the kung pao chicken with fried rice and a pork egg roll.  The chicken was fantastic - all white meat with no gristle (way too uncommon in chinese food) and a wonderful light crispiness.  Fresh high quality veggies as well.    The only down side for me was that the available seating is so limited.  I had to take my food to another area because there were no tables to be had.    I would seriously book my flights with a layover in Las Vegas specifically to eat here."}
{"text":"Oh my, the line is long & not moving. At this location, there's only 1 cashier, who has to get all the cooked meals from the kitchen to the counter. She's so busy that no one can order & pay. Can you hire more people at the counter ? Plus people at the airport are usually in a hurry on their way to the gate. Panda Express is so much better !!"}
{"text":"Small portions.  Relatively high cost.  No sauce on my kung poa chicken.  Meat dry and over cooked. I instant it is airport food,  but really?"}
{"text":"I have to give it a 2 star since the food was good...that was a surprise to me since the service was horrible. They have no clue how to run an efficient operation. It's sad cause this business is about food and SERVICE....they certainly failed on service. The food came out 20 mins longer than it should have it seemed all the employees had no clue who's food was who's. If the food was subpar they would get a 1 star. I ordered the kung pao chicken with fried rice.....that was good and some of the other dishes I saw look good as well. I hope they get it together so they can be successful."}
{"text":"Expect slightly more expensive pricing and a smaller menu than a regular Pei Wei.  Overall good experience, my food came out hot and within about 15 min. Brown rice was a bit hard (maybe in the heater for too long?) but overall good choice for an airport meal."}
{"text":"For airport dining it was better than average. I went with a bottled coke, so I can't speak to the quality of the soda machine. My coke was cold and the food was served hot. I ordered the Mongolian steak with no mushrooms. I appreciated that they cook to order and the rice tasted freshly made. The atmosphere was simple with low lighting, a nice reprieve from the crazy flashing sensory overload that is the rest of the Vegas airport. The chopsticks and condiments were well stocked and the dining room was cleaned frequently while I was here. Oh, and my food cane super quickly, which was nice."}
{"text":"Located in Terminal 3 Gate E-11 of McCarran International Airport. There's a bar on the left and on the right is where you order your food. Several TVs to watch a game. Some tables in the center but since it's at the airport, most of the seats are often taken. They use pagers if you decide to dine in.  BF's Order: Caramel Chicken  The dish wasn't overly greasy but there was more batter than meat ratio in the chicken pieces though. Was expecting something fairly bad but it turned out ok. It's all about expectations I suppose."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from an Asian restaurant at an airport--overpriced and not super flavorful. But they get an extra point for including tons of veggies in their veggie fried rice. The woman also told me the fried rice sauce had meat in it, so she made it with teriyaki sauce which was pretty cool. It still tasted pretty bland though."}
{"text":"Lo Mein Chicken Noodles, favors less and a big waste of money. Kung Pao Chicken was also flavorless and cooked with a battered chicken which like 4 pieces of chicken for 9.59 ...."}
{"text":"Best I can say is for an airport food selection, I was very happy. The beef was very tasty as were the scallions and mushrooms. The brown rice was simply another compliment.  Would do it again if faced with the decision!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei was the nearest bar at the Las Vegas Airport as Gayle and I were connecting through on the way to Des Moines and then back again a week or so later. It wasn't too crowded at the time, and we were able to sit, relax, and talk. The most interesting experience was striking up conversations with other fellow travelers. One in particular had just finished up a girls getaway to Vegas and was on her way home to deal with life (which was explained in perhaps too much detail). What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, even at the Airport."}
{"text":"Woah... this place is a wake up call when it comes to traditional airport grub.  I stopped by for egg & meat fried rice.  It was an enormous dish and really good."}
{"text":"I normally have good experiences at Pei Wei but this location in McCarron Airport was horrible.  Ordered the Lo Mein Noodles with Chicken.  The noodles were rubbery and not cooked properly.  The chicken was good but let's face it, it's a noodle dish and they should be the star.  Not so here.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"After seeing some of the reviews my boyfriend and I were a little hesitant on going. We are so glad we did though, we each got something different and shared. We both agreed it tasted and felt healthier than Panda Express (which we love!). Great option at the Phoenix airport if you are looking for a quick bite to eat in between lay over!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, wasn't bad but then it also wasn't anything outstanding. They use way too much sodium/soy sauce in all their food.  We had the Mongolian beef, Honey Chicken, & Chicken lettuce wrap and they all had tons of sodium. This place is definitely not worth the price. Especially after I saw the portion size. I found out later that Panda Express was also here, which is cheaper in price, probably the same quality, and larger portions. It does look like a good deal though because they were right next to Deluxe Burger which has $13 burgers. This place is a huge rip off. Won't be eating here again next time I fly thru here."}
{"text":"It was early in the morning at the airport & I was on the hunt for breakfast & what appealed to me on this menu was eggs with fried rice.  I did, at one point ask someone if all the items on he menu were available and was told yes, so for those of you who read this : boom! There's your answer.   :)  I ordered my food with two egg rolls & I checked their drink fountain machine unfortunately they didn't have plain black tea.  The cashier let me know that the grab & go display had tea.  The dining area is self seating & so I did.  The food arrived unexpectedly fast but I was very hungry & happy about it.  Unfortunately, the food was very disappointing.  The fried rice was not good at all. The rice was mushy & I could taste ketchup in the rice. What I did like was the cabbage & sprouts were crunchy.  There was bacon & apple sausage mixed in & they were fine.  My biggest sadness was I anticipated a nice fried egg on top, unfortunately, it's mixed into the fried rice, unless you were to look real closely, you wouldn't think there was egg in it.  I would recommend to the chefs as feedback, stop adding ketchup, put a fried egg on top (its better for presentation), and the rice is way over cooked that it ends up like mush.  The egg rolls were fine but obviously previously frozen.  From the start, the cashier was not engaging and didn't smile. I felt as if I was disturbing her peace & quiet since the restaurant wasn't so busy.   I even asked for a cup for ice for the expensive Black Tea I bought from the grab & go & she lifted a tiny plastic cup.  Overall, the food was disappointing & I left here with an un-wow experience.  I won't be eating at any other of these restaurants in the future.  :/"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Prices are good. I did not think we got alot in our food containers but it was more thN enough. Nice lunch while we wait for our filght."}
{"text":"LOUIS was our bartender. Not sure why we didn't have a great time in Vegas, maybe it was just so dang hot. Sat at the bar and had the best time. For whatever reason, we had the best time for that hour and a half, sitting at some random bar at the airport. Sadly, that was our Vegas fun."}
{"text":"A fairly decent Asian style restaurant at the airport.  Slightly less expensive than the nearby options in the A20 concourse area.  We had a couple of items and they were tasty.  The egg rolls, while delicious, were swimming in grease.  One note of caution, they aren't the fastest place, so if you have a tight connection and there's a line, it may be tight.  Otherwise, give this place a try.  definitely better than the pizza place next door."}
{"text":"Fried Rice was not so nice. Passing through PHX airport I decided to stop here at Pei Wei. The chicken fried rice was a disappointment.  I will call it the not so fried rice due to the lack of...let's say it was rice with chicken, lack of vegetable and no egg which typically goes into a fried rice, besides the fact that it's description claims to include egg, broccoli, carrots and peppers. The flavor was there but felt I received a rice and chicken dish and not what I ordered and expected. I wish I had taken a picture to show as the image did not match the one displayed on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm signing an Executive Order temporarily banning all items from these 7 areas of their menu from entering my mouth, stomach, or any other part of my body: Steak, Chicken, Lo Mein, Fried Rice, Lettuce Wraps, Egg Rolls, and Soup (Beverages aren't on my banned list, so I'm not targeting everything for EXTREME VETTING).  I won't say that all 7 of these are dangerous to my health and safety, but at a minimum they have the potential to terrorize my taste buds and I need to figure out WHAT THE HELL is going on before eating here again! Even for airport food, you'd hope for better. It's like the \"Chinese\" food version of FAKE NEWS. How could staples like Kung Pao Chicken taste so weird and be botched so bad? There's almost enough oil on the noodles to refuel the plane.   This ban is only temporary though. Because one day, when I only have a few minutes before having to catch a flight and am desperately looking for food inside the Vegas airport, I'll come back here like an idiot thinking it can't possibly be as regrettable as remembered. And when it is, I'll still be in disbelief that this so-called Chinese food made it past the TSA and back into my stomach."}
{"text":"I find myself here every time I leave sin city. The entrees are not exactly \"Asian authentic\", but it's also not too Americanized. Each entree ranges from $11-13, depending if you upgrade to fried rice or noodles. Portions are okay, looks like they give more when you order for dine in versus to-go, but idk. Overall, not bad for an airport eat."}
{"text":"So airport food is usually very expensive, greasy, often been sitting under a heat lamp for who knows how long and not that great.    Had a 3 hour layover in Vegas and found this little gem.  It's cooked fresh to order, the place is clean and the food was tasty and quality.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Painfully slow service. Terrible food with soggy entrees, dried out rice and several items unavailable. The trifecta of airport dining mishaps."}
{"text":"We ordered a mango chicken with white rice. Chicken was slightly crispy, but very salty. I would try going somewhere else before eating here again."}
{"text":"Descent Asian Food.  Not Authentic but it's acceptable considering it is at the airport.    Kung Pao chicken is a bit salty.  The chicken was breaded and it seemed it was the breading that caused it to be salty.  The steak fried rice was pretty good just a tad bit oily.  The service was great.  The lady who took our order was very friendly."}
{"text":"There's a crowd of 20 people waiting for food and have been for 10 minutes. One girl's order was messed up and they've taken 10 min to fix it. A customer was angry and the cashier just yelled back at him. Food might be decent but service is atrocious."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei food, but our experience yesterday was almost unacceptable. I'm am not a person who thinks \"people should learn English to work in America,\" but I do believe a person should understand English enough to know their menu. We ordered two orders of spicy chicken. Easy, right? No.  The person taking our order ordered just one order of spicy chicken. When we informed her that we wanted TWO SPICY CHICKEN, she said, \"Teriyaki chicken?\" \"NO, spicy chicken.\" So, she charged us again. Yes, two credit card charges instead of one. Sigh... Well, then we got one order of spicy chicken and one order of teriyaki chicken. Really?!?! Ugh..."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, tastes fresh, normal airport prices (a little on the spendy side). I would eat here again if I wanted Asian in the airport. That's saying something, because I've had some horrific airport meals. The service was fast and friendly. The woman who helped me was a little weird and hesitant about me wanting a drink after I'd paid for my food, but she wasn't rude or snippy."}
{"text":"As Chinese food, the taste is so so... I had a Pei Wei special spicy steak, which is not spicy but tastes sour...and it is not steak but only regular beef :( moreover they forgot my rice! Like 1/3 regular dinner plate amount cost $10 plus!!! Anyways they made me a side rice at the end.   And when you are at the airport if you want something hot, you do not have many choices, I say it is worthy trying."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Pei Wei in 3 years...  the first time in concourse C the food was so salty I could not finish it. I did not visit again until now and the food has not changed.  It is so salty I couldn't stop coughing. Worst 10 dollars for a Mongolian steak I've ever spent.    P.S.   Make sure you have lots of water to drink."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service for airport food. The menu was accommodating for many dietary needs an they had no problem removing items I couldn't eat.  The packaging makes it easy to take on the plane for those who have to wait to eat in the air.  Fresh food made simple."}
{"text":"Between our flight from Seattle and our upcoming flight to El Paso, we decided to have dinner at Pei Wei Asian Diner.  My wife had the chicken lettuce wraps and I had the Mongolian steak.  Both of our meals were good.  Fast service."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei and couldn't resist eating here after my flight since the two close to my home recently changed. Decided to try their new Mandarin Kung Pao - bad decision. It was pure salt!  Hardly any chicken in the fried batter, no mandarin flavor what so ever, and did I mention, SALTY!!    The two people beside me ordered the Mongolian steak and spicy chicken - I became jealous quick!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is fast.  Lunch depends on line.  Not a lot of seating as it shares space with a bar."}
{"text":"Grosssss. I got the spicy sour chicken with noodles (+$1 extra) and it was sooo soo unappetizing. The noodles tasted so artificial and the 'spicy sour' sauce that the chicken was drenched in was nasty. It had this fake and prelate taste to it. This experience made me not want to try Pei Wei ever again, and this was my first time!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is inside/past the security checkpoint in terminal \"C\" at the airport in Las Vegas.You must have a ticket or boarding pass if you need/want to get to this restaurant."}
{"text":"5 airport food stars. This was such a nice surprise to find. The chicken in the Kung Pao was juicy and delicious.  The chicken in the lettuce wraps was fantastic as well. I love the cool lettuce with spicy chicken combo. I recommend upgrading to fried rice with your entree."}
{"text":"Expensive but the meal I had was tasty and served up quick.  They have a nice seating area to chill out and they will bring your food to you so you can read a book, twiddle your thumbs, people watch, or stare into space.  It was one of the few \"decent\" selections for airport dining in that craphole."}
{"text":"I was craving some chow mein so I decided to stop here while I waited for my flight.  The noodles were just ok. I ordered the vegetable chow mein. The vegetables were very fresh and crunchy and the noodles were tender and not mushy. The flavors are not real heavy so I did add a touch of soy sauce but not much at all. The portion size was pretty large too. The price was about right and actually fairly inexpensive for \"airport\" prices. It came to just around $10 with tax.  My complaint would be that the noodles had a very greasy texture to them. Not like a hole in the wall type joint but like \"I used too much vegetable oil to stir fry this\" type feel."}
{"text":"I used to come very often to this Pei Wei because we don't have any where I live.  Today I had a connection to Newark (6/10/16  @ 9:55 pm) so I wanted a fast plate to take to the plane. I ordered the spicy chicken. I've received my plate pretty fast as on the other times but... surprise, my first piece of chicken was not fully cooked and bloody so I went back to the counter and asked for another plate. Instead of an apologize or a complimentary something... I could see and heard the \"chef\" saying: \"it's only one piece\". I was furious about it... even if is \"one piece\", you are giving your customer raw meat!!. I didn't say anything and just wait for my new plate (of course,  checking that my food was not being contaminated with other things after my complain). I wanted to ask for the manager and tell him how unrespectful was the comment from his employee but I was getting late to my flight. So I really hope the establishment reads Yelp to improve their customer service.  I really enjoy Pei Wei... but I hope they train their people. I can understand that everybody makes mistakes but that was not the way to address my observation about a wrong cooked plate. Even when I got my new plate, I did not get a sorry from anybody."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews for this place have not been very good, but I am not sure what people expect for airport food.  For starters, the menu is interesting and has some unique items for Chinese fast food.  I ordered the chicken fried rice and a pork egg roll.  I was served pretty quickly.  Although the food was a little pricy, the portion sizes was good.  I.may have had low expectations after reading other reviews, but the fried rice was better than I expected with nice, big chunks of chicken.  It tasted pretty fresh also.  The egg roll was also tasty.  I was pretty pleased overall, I will probably visit this place again."}
{"text":"I had theMongolian beef w/brown rice. Just the right mix of marinated goodness with sweet green onion. The brown rice is pushed to the side just in case you are taking it to your plane for a bite later.  The vegetable spring rolls with sweet and spicy dip pin'  sauce were good as well.  AND, their fortune cookies are the GOOD ones! All and all this was one of the better \"fast bite\" airport dishes I've enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such low ratings. The food was very tasty and the lady even brought me extra sauce for my king pao without me even asking.    The lady at the bar was fun and cracked jokes the whole time. Nothing better than good food and a fun bartender. I was able to find a charger to charge my phone and enjoy a nice meal and a drink. Seemed pretty perfect to me.   The drinks are super expensive but hey it's an airport and its Vegas!! They had a special whee if you buy and drink, cheapest beer was 8.99, you get a shot for only $5! I had an angry orchard and a shot of fireball! Mmmm. My food was not only filling but I had plenty left over for another meal."}
{"text":"Breakfast options are slim at 6am in terminal 4. I went for the becon egg and cheese on a croissant. Hard to screw up this classic and I was not disappointed. The croissant was lightly toasted and there just a small amount of yolk running out of the egg. I skipped the Sriracha mayo and did some hot mustard instead. All in all, a good sammich for a good price (considering it's an airport location )."}
{"text":"Looked like quite a wait for to go orders. Dine in was fairly quick. Somewhat limited but adequate menu compared to Pei Weis at off airport locations. Brown rice was badly overlooked and very dry."}
{"text":"Food a step above Panda Express. The big downside was the surly bartender complaining about the job and how he was being taken advantage of all the time. Kept saying this is BS (full words) and I need to file a grievance. Even if it is true, you don't do that in front of customers."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but one of the staff members was rude the entire time. She was would give snappy comments to my friends and I and complain about every little thing we were doing. We moved two table together so our small group could sit together and she made it seem like it was the worst thing to do in a restaurant. Her manner was uncalled for. We weren't be rude or loud or obnoxious. Most of us were actually on the computer doing school work while we ate but because we were the only group in there we were treated very poorly. Won't be going here again next flight in Vegas."}
{"text":"I crown the Lo Mein at Pei Wei at the LV airport the worst noodles in the world.  I am asian and love asian noodles and have traveled the world enjoying them.  They took the noodles from the pot and put them directly into a plastic container, put a few pieces of chicken on top, and closed the lid.  They added absolutely no seasoning.  Yes, no seasoning.  I had to pour five packets of soy sauce on it to give it some flavor.  Pei Wei should be ashamed of serving such disgusting food and charging for it.  Your cooks need to be re-trained."}
{"text":"The food is alright. I didn't have to wait to long for my food. If you're in a rush then don't come here but if you got time sure why not."}
{"text":"Got to try 'em at the employee preopening...and was satisfied.  Tried 'em a few days after their grand opening...and was satisfied.  For the price, I am just not seeing spending money for the product based on quality or quantity.    This stuff certainly will stop hunger.  For the price, I just cannot see spending this instead of making it at home.    If it were somehow beyond what I have found on the street, maybe I could see the price difference."}
{"text":"SOUP SOUP SOUP! Looking for soup? This place is the only restaurant that has soup on this side of McCarran. Or at least as far as I could tell when I was looking for some asian soup last Sunday afternoon. Perfect if you had a looong night the night before if you know what I mean ;)  Like most airport food (in the US), this place is just OK. Don't expect anything amazeballs. However, when you are hungry, craving rice and soup, and are on your way home after a short weekend in vegas, this place does the trick, which is why I'm going with a four!  LE MENU: -Thai Wonton Soup: Nothing really \"Thai\" about it but it was soup with spinach and wontons! Flavorful, but I would caution you to mix it well before you start drinking it. Ours got saltier as we got closer to the bottom of the cup. Oh and their large cup isn't filled all the way to the top so that is kinda misleading. But again, SOUP! -Fried Rice with Chicken. They gave us a LOT of chicken, so that is a plus if you are hungry I guess. Fried rice wasn't too bad! I was comparing it with panda express and I think I would choose Panda's fried rice over Pei Wei, but overall I was still satisfied.   PROS: -i'm glad there was at least one asian cuisine option  -lots of juices and beverage options, including gatorade  CONS: -not a lot of seating -not authentic asian food, obviously"}
{"text":"Adequate if not exceptional. Breakfast Bacon egg croissant was soft n fresh but seemed a little greasy. Painted with butter perhaps. Fairly filling and at less than $6, a good value for airport food.  Can order and pay at kiosk. Not instant but reasonably fast as apparently cooked as ordered."}
{"text":"Wow... not in a good way. I only ate here because nothing else looked good in that part of the airport. My biggest complaint was that the place was dirty, including the plate on which the food was served. There were dirty plates that have not been collected, random pieces of rice on the tables, and paper napkins all over the floor. Most importantly the plate with my food was not very clean at all. It looked like it hadn't been washed properly for a long time. Yeah, time to toss them and buy new ones especially since they're supposed to be white!  As for the food, I ordered their honey seared chicken. It was edible, but I wouldn't even count it as good Americanized version of Asian food. Next time I will just eat somewhere else or go on a fast."}
{"text":"Great food for an airport asian place.   If you are gluten free get the spicy chicken...lots of flavor and a good portion size for the price.  Pretty speedy service too. When I hit this airport again I will come back here."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken with brown rice: Salty, heavy sauce, brown rice is dry, oily veggie. Wish they can improve. Until then, not going again or try other items."}
{"text":"As far as airport food goes, this place has to be among the top. I've flown into the Las Vegas airport numerous times so when I was here recently I instantly remembered this place. $10 rice bowl meals---cannot be beat for that price and quality at an airport. I've got the Kung pao chicken and pei Wei chicken before, so this time I tried the caramel chicken. Overall it was good as well. These three are the 'spicy' dishes they offer, which of course are not as spicy as I would like, but I also understand that they are an airport locale and trying to appeal to the general public. There is still good flavor with the garlic, ginger, and scallions. They give you plenty of rice for the amount of food. You can also substitute fried rice or noodles for an upcharge. If you are looking for a fulfilling meal that is not crappy overpriced fast food and have enough time (at least an hour between flights) give them a try! They are in the southwest hub of the airport. Service is fairly quick, but to make sure you can enjoy your food about an hour is perfect."}
{"text":"Heaping entrees are $9-11 and are as good as at the Pei Wei's back home. Every vegetable was vibrant, impressive and delicious. Some of the best airport food I've ever had and such a great value. I got the lo mein, he got the spicy chicken, everything was great."}
{"text":"Stop here every time I have a layover and they're always fast, pleasant and good. I order the honey seared chicken and it's always hot, fresh and delicious. Service is quick and painless."}
{"text":"My flight was delayed for over 4 hours, which meant instead of getting to eat dinner at my destination as originally planned, I instead had to overpay for some crappy airport food. At first I was pleased to see a Pei Wei in the airport as an option, as I have had pretty good experiences at other Pei Wei locations, but that pleasure quickly changed to disappointment.   Perhaps it was due to the massive amount of delayed and canceled flights that particular evening, but the line to order was ridiculously long. When I finally did get to order, I was told I had to take my meal 'to go'. This was due to the fact that Pei Wei shares a seating area with a bar, and numerous tables were being used by people with no food, just a laptop and half drank beers. There were even signs by some tables that stated that they were for Pei Wei customers only, but since no one from Pei Wei actually enforced that, the signs were pointless.   All of this would be forgiven if the food was decent. It's airport food, my expectations weren't very high, and I was still disappointed. My 'Pei Wei Spicy Chicken' meal lacked any form of spice or flavor. The rice was dryer than the desert surrounding Las Vegas. Half my meal went in the trash.   I guess if you are stuck at McCarran C Gates and are starving, Pei Wei is one of the better options available to you. That isn't saying much though..."}
{"text":"We love Pei Wei, although we usually go to the one in Grayhawk, but this location is great too.  I had kids menu, chicken teriyaki but I changed it to tofu instead and it come with vegetables, was delicious!"}
{"text":"I had to grab dinner before my flight out of Phoenix Airport.  I asked the ever-cheerful airport volunteer staff about restaurant options in my terminal, and they had a map of the restaurants beyond security--and I was happy to see a Pei Wei!  I timed it well--very short line--but after I sat down, a rush of people came and they had to wait.  The staff was very helpful, and even had a photo board to explain the menu options.  They gave me a buzzer to notify me when my order was up, so I could wander around the food court to find a seat.  The food was ready very promptly, and it was delicious.  I had the Kung Pao Chicken--about what you would expect, but freshly made, nice quality, good mix of chicken and nice vegetables (not the zuccini you so often find in this dish).  Not spicy enough for me, but it's Pei Wei.    Great alternative to other airport food choices, very satisfying and tasty meal.  I'll look for them again."}
{"text":"I thought Pei Wei has pretty good airport food. I had the breakfast croissant and my gf had the bacon and egg fried rice. Both dishes were delicious and filling. The prices were normal for an airport, overpriced. The only drawback was that it took a long time for them to prepare the food which when you're trying to get a quick meal before your flight can be an issue."}
{"text":"I don't know about the rest of the airport, but the area I always end up in by flying Southwest has some pretty dreadful food choices.  I like having the option of going to Pei Wei.  I haven't experienced any of the quality control issues other people have mentioned.  It just seems like standard Pei Wei fare to me.  What I find irritating is the limited menu, which prevents me from getting my usual choice of ginger chicken with broccoli.  I usually have to get something covered in batter.  At least I can get brown rice.  The seating area is frustratingly small.  It can definitely be a challenge to find a place to eat when the airport is crowded.  I thought that it was ridiculous that I was charged $3.50 for a regular sized bottle of water on my last visit.  I know that I shouldn't be surprised by that since I was in an airport, but being gouged never feels good."}
{"text":"I should have known better to check with yelp before I pulled the trigger to order from here. In a bit of a rush to my plane and the wait here made me check my watch every five minutes, three times over.   Slow service aside, the food is enough to fill you up. The down side is that is mostly with salt and oil. The chicken chow main came piping hot so if you are embarrassed to blow on your food before you board you might want a 15 dollar burger from next door.   If you need something to put in your belly, decent choice given other options, but some trail mix is probably a better decision."}
{"text":"This place is alright for airport food. The brown rice was good and the kung pap chicken was pretty spicy. My order took a long time to receive, but they  were busy."}
{"text":"This is very good asían, specially for an airport... Try the noodles. There is also a good amount of space to sit and a bar with TVs"}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei. I go to Pei Wei all the time back home! So when I see it in the airport, I am always excited! Except this Pei Wei. This Pei Wei can't get my meal right. Their Kung Pao has like 10 times the amount of garlic it should. Like you probably shouldn't sit 10 feet away from strangers after eating this Kung Pao. Too bad we are all getting in air planes together after this. Also, if you pay extra for noodles, just give us noodles! After two disappointing visits to this Pei Wei, I won't be waisting my time here again."}
{"text":"Meh.., for the price I thought it would be better. Order the Japanese teriyaki plate, it was horrid. Fried chicken swimming in soy sauce. I ate a small nugget of chicken and had to spit it out, it was so overly fried, greasy and just plain inedible. Should have just bought a sandwich"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were having a rough time trying to find a place for our mix of breakfast and lunch \"brunch\" needs due to the short time frame traveling to the airport and not being able to grab something on the way there. Luckily we came across this little saver of Thai/Asian cuisine before our flight.   At this Pei Wei we ordered our food at the counter and were given a designated table number for them to locate you for food delivery. Both of us ordered a spicy dish that wasn't very spicy at all and came fresh and hot. My chicken versus rice portion was just right; however, my boyfriend's plate had a lot of rice than actual entrée. We also both ordered brown rice, yet his came with white rice. This was an easy fix once I asked for the exchange-No additional lip or cost. The ladies behind the counter were nice and sweet, plus they cleaned up the areas immediately."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars.  Here is the thing, it's airport food and to be fair, nobody expects much at this point in American airports. The general variety is from utterly horrific to mystifying to bearable. After Yelping and not finding better options, I came here as the open kitchen looked relatively clean.  Chicken Fried Rice was very plastic tasting. The chicken tasted as if it was stuck with twenty rounds of antibiotics, fed some fattening chemicals, layered in MSG and put on a gas grill. Seriously, this was the most plastic tasting chicken ever. At moments, I wondered if I am chewing on a children's toy. Other than that, the chicken fried rice was passable, the service was reasonably quick and they got the order right."}
{"text":"I'm having Kung Pao Chicken now. It's the most horrible dish I've ever had, way too salty and dry. Put it on your blacklist for sure."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute disgrace to the Pei Wei Brand. Upon arriving just a few minutes prior to 10pm I was ordering when suddenly I was startled by a very condescending tone yelling from kitchen \"We're done!..I don't care what he ordered\" I pleaded with the worker that it wasn't 10pm yet and all I wanted was a soup and the cashier then pleaded to the person named Caesar that was yelling the remarks. He then laughed and rolled his eyes adding \"I'm the boss and I don't care\" then laughed more and said something under his breath that made the other workers in the back shake their head and laugh. One of the other guests waiting said that's not right he shouldn't be so rude to which he laughed and said \"I don't care!\" Then walked away. The cashier was shocked and just looked down. This whole incident could have easily been avoided and more importantly handled differently. I'm currently writing a letter to HMS Host and Pei Wei's Brand Support Center as this was completely and utterly disgraceful. Please feel free to contact me for more information."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Decor & Style: 4/5  For fast food I really enjoy the food here. Most importantly, It is no where near anything like real Chinese food (i'm of Chinese heritage), however I come here expecting good Chinese-American food and it's exactly what it is! Fried rice is good, orange chicken is good, and peppered beef is good. For a chain fast Chinese-American food this probably beats them all!"}
{"text":"For being at an airport, I was pleasantly surprised. My meal was great - no complaints. Veggies were crisp and meat was juicy. A repeat place."}
{"text":"This review is only for the bar area... My bartender Elizabeth was awesome. Stella on tap and a side shot of fireball.... Yumm"}
{"text":"Pei wei is always my go to for airport food in Las Vegas. Highly qualify than fast food airport options but not full restaurant prices. Their food is made freshly upon your order - I recommend the steak fried rice. Pei wei is located at the E gates in terminal 3 (JetBlue) and C gates in terminal 1 (southwest). Terminal 1 C gates can get pretty crazy busy so you might have to wait longer to get your food depending on the line. If there is no wait the food comes out very quickly."}
{"text":"Nothing special, nothing good.. except that it's as close as you can get to something Asian at the airport.  Ordered spicy tuna rolls and wonton soup.  Sushi rolls were not fresh, typical prepackaged rolls you can find at grocery markets. Wonton was disappointing - lacked in flavor and traditional ingredients. Broth was salty.  Not impressed, not satified."}
{"text":"The wait was a tad long, but the food was top rate. They gave me alot of rice, which was nice.  Price was decent for airport food.  I will likely go back, if at the airport."}
{"text":"It was one of those lazy nights and we wanted something quick to eat. The place was surprisingly  busy. It's off of Shea Blvd. I don't order their noodles because the last time I had them, they were over cooked. The food came out HOT and we shared our plates. I ended up taking the leftovers home and had another meal the following day."}
{"text":"The dish was hot and good, but they left a few ingredients out that are specified in the menu that the dish has. When I got it to their attention all they said is sorry."}
{"text":"I love pei Wei but this one has failed me several times now, wrong order almost every time I've been here now, I got Kung pow chicken and it was cold, that can't be good."}
{"text":"The order took a long time to be complete. Ordered Kung Pao vegetables. The veggies were great. Crisp and fresh. The rice was standard (brown). There were very few peanuts. The sauce is the issue. Repeat after me: salt does not equal flavor. It was very salty. Like more salty then I've had in years. It felt like a salt shaker was emptied in the food and it overpowered the taste of lots of it as there is a lot of sauce. I drank an entire bottle of water with lunch. Never happens. Back off the salt. Too much!"}
{"text":"It's hot from the wok alright. Other than that, this place has nothing else going for it. Bland and flavorless."}
{"text":"Family needed to eat while on a layover in Vegas. A pro was that there was actually one gluten free option here. Cons were that service was extremely slow (waited at least 20 mins) and service was pretty unfriendly."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei's menu, and I really love the actual restaurants. This small one in Sky Harbor is nice to have around when passing through Phoenix, even though it has the normal limited menu and options airports restaurants have.  The service is about what you come to expect from airport restaurant staff, not terrible but not great either. I always get a sense of contempt from restaurant staff in airports, but I can't say I blame them.  The food quality is what I've come to expect from Pei Wei. Fresh veggies, good quality meats, and every sauce in every dish is always pretty good.  It was fresh food for sure. Maybe a bit smaller portion because again it's an airport restaurant.    I was in the midst of an 18 hour/ 2 layover travel day. So having this meal was definitely an upside to a rough day.  If you're in sky harbor and are looking for some good Asian food, give Pei Wei a try."}
{"text":"When I lived in Tucson, I'd go to Pei Wei on the regular.  Loved the chopped chicken salads.  I was flying back from Tucson, bummed that I wasn't able to stop into Pei Wei while I was there. During my layover in Vegas, I about fell over when I saw the Pei Wei in the airport.  YES!!! I could get my beloved salad after all!  Super bummed that it was an extremely abbreviated menu; my favorite salad was grab-and-go only, and they were out.  They couldn't make another one.  Bummmmmmmer.  I ordered teriyaki chicken, and was very disappointed.  It didn't taste like teriyaki at all, but it didn't taste like anything else on the menu, so I was left wondering exactly what it was........but I didn't have time before my flight boarded to investigate further or get something else.   If you're a Pei Wei fan, pass on this airport location."}
{"text":"Just brutal.  Look: I was at a chain \"Asian\" restaurant in an airport that has never had good food.  I certainly didn't go in expecting great food.  But I did expect Panda Express level food -- a fast food chain that will deliver me what I'm looking for at that moment.    This was just plain terrible.    I expected greasy; that's part of the genre known as \"Cheap Chinese\".  But I wasn't expecting dripping with grease, including the brown rice.  I was expecting sweet; also part of the genre.  But I expected some flavor with my sugar bomb, especially since I ordered the dish that was called \"spicy\".    They claim they make everything fresh, but   I was really hungry, I like this type of food, and I would have cleaned every bite from a Styrofoam container of Panda Express... I barely finished half of this order, and got on the plane still hungry."}
{"text":"You're in the airport after your exhausting/exhilarating Vegas trip, and you need a quick bite before your flight home. Burger King is too fried for your liking, and you don't want to drop $30 for an entree at the chophouse. Oh hey, this Asian place looks kind of healthy (veggies, amirite?), and it's only about $10 a plate. And thus, you find yourself grabbing food from Pei Wei.  Don't expect anything better than Panda Express from this place. The food's decent by airport standards, and I did like that there was no surcharge for brown rice. Their \"spicy\" chicken can be better described as marginally peppery chicken, which was really the biggest disappointment of this whole endeavour. But like I said, you're in an airport and thus have lowered expectations for food. Pei Wei definitely satisfies those lowered expectations."}
{"text":"Bad service. Beef dish is tasty but too salty without enough rice. When I complained they wanted to charge $2.50."}
{"text":"On the bottom corner of the menu it says: \"Pei Wei Asian Diner, brought to you by P.F. Chang's.\"  So there you go.  And it's worse than P.F. Chang's. A lot worse.  There are a lot of other options in Concourse C, where this abomination and insult to Chinese food wastes space. Skip it."}
{"text":"I am always skeptical of any dining establishment in an airport. How much of my saving is it going to cost me to eat here? How terrible is the food going to taste? Fortunately, my taste buds were happy and my wallet was spared by my visit to Pei Wei.  In terms of costs, I saw no real different in the price here versus the traditional spots I go to. Yes, this did cost more, but overall I didn't feel the pinch like I do when I'm at the airport and buy a $5 bag of chips.  The service was pretty fast. The Mongolian beef is my go to no matter what Pei Wei I'm at. It came loaded with mushrooms and scallions, just how I like it.  The dining area is really small so you get to know your neighbor and you'll probably knock them in the back of the head with your book bag- oh that was just me, sorry. But the spot was clean and other than being cramped was ok by me."}
{"text":"This place was slammed on a late night at the PHX airport, and my flight was boarding soon, but I love bento so thought I'd take a chance. I'm glad I did. I ordered the Carmel chicken with brown rice. The wait was less than 10 minutes (great considering the crowds) and the food was good. Not too greasy, hot, and fresh. If you like Asian style food, I recommend this place for airport fare."}
{"text":"Good place for an Asian meal in Las Vegas terminal C. Lines move quickly and they have a nice bar and sit-down restaurant if you have time to kill and can resist the slot machines!   I got the Spicy Pei Wei chicken with brown rice. Chicken was ok, the veggies they served with it were crisp and fresh. The rice was a bit on the dry side but edible, especially when I mixed it in with the spicy Pei Wei sauce. Value was ok at $9.99 - appreciate that they didn't charge extra for brown rice like a lot of restaurants tend to do."}
{"text":"This looks like the perfect place for a healthier grab and go. It isn't. It makes Panda Express seem like fine dining.  I specifically wanted a chicken dish that wasn't breaded.  The cashier directed me to the lo mein.  I get to my gate and, of course, it is breaded, but it was too late to go back and yell at them. I never yell. They deserve a yell. The pieces of chicken were virtually beef jerky they were so over-cooked and old.  Disgusting! Apparently from the Yelp reviews I saw afterward, this place has zero quality control.  If you are the entrepreneur behind this venue you should be thoroughly embarrassed. Not only do your workers deliver a disgusting and questionably fresh product, they also lie about it. I have never purchased food from an airport concession more worthy of being shut down.   It is clearly just a matter of time."}
{"text":"Stars for the food. Pretty good of you have an hour and a half to kill.. \"Daeng\" working the register is one of the slowest moving creatures I've ever encountered! I remembered her name because I was thinking \"Dang! I have a plane to catch!\" While it took her 12 minutes to ring up a bottled water and ready packaged sushi. Not cool"}
{"text":"I am not one to test out Chinese food in random places, especially an airport. I did yelp this spot and though the reviews weren't the best I was starving and though I could get out of my comfort zone. I went in with low expectations despite the clean eating area and efficient sounding staff. I had already envisioned the bad Yelp review that was about to come. And then wow....like double wow! I won't say that this was the best Chinese food that I've ever had but for an airport really late at night (red eye) in an airport terminal....totally impressive.  I got the chicken lo mein and it was a little bland overall but had a very decent amount of chicken, a somewhat fresh consistency to the noodles and a decent portion of crunchy veggies. After adding a somewhat excessive amount of soy sauce and hot chili sauce, this was a pretty good meal and i actually finished all of it (hardly every happens in an airport).   Very quick service, priced a bit on the high side but a very satisfying meal while waiting for your plain. The smell is too much to bring on the plane but it's a pleasant surprise.   Not good enough for outside of the airport, but better than good for in an airport and recommended.   Panda express is disgusting compared to this spot. More than a few notches above.   Recommended."}
{"text":"The Pei Wei in the airport by gate e12 sucks.  It says it closes at 9:30.  NOPE closes at 7pm and rude about it. 7:15  and closed.  They had 7 people standing there dumb found that a place would close at dinner time"}
{"text":"Waiting for a connection and not much in A gates.  Ordered one vegetable spring roll and one pork roll.  Took five minutes which was great to not having to wait long.  The vegetable roll was not bad, a little better than your average fast food roll.  The pork roll, however, was drenched in oil.  The sweet chili sauce was good though.  All in all, $3.99 wasn't bad for airport food."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Pei Wei and I was so impressed.  This Pei Wei is in the Las Vegas airport.  The line was long, the dining space was cramped and the service was slow...as with all airport restaurants that are worth eating at.  I ordered a cup of Thai Wonton Soup & a bow of Edamame, $9.  Overpriced but generous portions by airport standards.  It was ALL delish!  The wonton soup was just perfect. Pei Wei is definitely on the radar."}
{"text":"I got some prepackaged sushi I ate there, and a ban mi sandwich for later. It was all so so. I was in a hurry, nothing photo worthy.   If you're at the airport, and want something quick, and Asian, and decent, this your spot. It was like $15.00."}
{"text":"Line was pretty long when we went but it was dinner time. Had seemingly healthier options than the other places in the airport. Only got the spring rolls but they were tasty!!"}
{"text":"No !! I am sorry, it is not justified to judge them by one meal .. but I got to say what I got on my plate.  Pei Wei Spicy was my order - Wok-seared chicken in sweet vinegar sauce with chily paste, scallions, garlic, snap peas and carrots .. right from the quantity to the chicken, there could have been an ocean of improvement. If I would have to rate just on this rice bowl it would have been 1.5 stars and no more .. but then there is other side of the coin as well, I will get to it.  I have had better, so called, Chinese at places, at a lot of places and I am talking about them at Airports. May be it was one off order .. may be it wasn't their day.. I am not sure but from that bowl that is all they are getting from me.  Well, the other side which gave them an added 1.5 stars is for their hospitality. My friend was vegetarian and as there is nothing veggie in their menu he inquired if they could get him a custom made veggie noodle's bowl. Yes was the answer and then the process was overwhelming (in a good way) .. they cleaned their wok, washed it and then started the prep. It was more than we could have asked for.  So, well the chicken .. umm nope. the veggie noodles .. yeah totally :)"}
{"text":"I waited 20 Min for a GF entree, and didn't receive my food because the chefs decided to serve four other entrees before mine, because GF entrees take longer. Instead of doing mine first they waited, because they had to clean and start with no oil. Very disappointed. And didn't even get a refund."}
{"text":"Had about 1/2 hour before needed to board so thought there was plenty of time to get some food for dinner.  Despite working in an airport, the women taking orders had no concept of time.  Waited a good 20 minutes for the food while these women took their time handing out the completed orders that were already waiting on the counter.  Then they had some discussion about something and just stopped getting the food ready for a couple of minutes.  Again, food was ready and just sitting on the counter.  Slow, apathetic workers and busy airports just don't mix."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Pei Wei for consistent, yummy and definitely very \"Americanized\" Chinese food. While this location is not exactly the best example of their offering (including versus other airport locations), it is a solid choice for a decent meal on the go.  My usual pick is the teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice and they also now have a pretty appealing breakfast bowl.  Keep in mind that while this is fast food, they make each order on demand so if there's a line, expect a wait.   And oh, there's outlets around the high counter seats to charge as you wait / eat."}
{"text":"Fortunately the Las Vegas airport has many food options, if you have the time and energy to walk through all the terminals. I had a lovely 6 hour layover and so I ventured about, in search of my best bet for a dining option. I finally chose Pei Wei because I saw a flight attendant in line, and I figured they know airport food best. I ordered the Lo Mein, and asked if they can make it spicy, which they obliged. I also purchased the little stack wine, which isn't good, but it's wine, and at $6 it can't be beat - at the airport. I took my Lo Mein back to my terminal where I found a cozy corner to dine.  The lo mein wasn't spicy whatsoever; honestly it was quite bland and could have used a little soy sauce and sriracha, but I wasn't offered any, and I didn't have any on hand. I guess it pretty much tasted like a healthy frozen meal. However, the portion size was large, and for that I was thankful."}
{"text":"wow. this might be the best healthy airport food I've ever had. I got the chicken teriyaki, vegetarian style, sauce on the side, and it's brown rice with fresh sautéed veggies. delish!"}
{"text":"Received a prompt reply and apology from corporate, along with vouchers for a free meal.  I will use these at the Chicago location I have frequented, and which has always served great food and provided great service.  I appreciate the way they quickly addressed my experience.  **5 Stars applies to Corporate's response.**"}
{"text":"Just okay, I thought it would be a nice alternative to typical airport options. We had to grab something quick between connecting flights, but this ended up not being very quick. I though the food was rather pedestrian. No better than Panda Express except you don't see the food pre-prepared and waiting for you."}
{"text":"Staff at 3:28pm dec 19 could not tell me the calories in a chicken lettuce wrap and said that there was no manager.   Food good.    Asked another employee, who did get \"the manager\" who listened patiently to my training suggestion, and got busy printing out a recently updated nutritional value chart. It revealed that the chicken lettuce wrap entree w/o sauce is 670 calories.   The Thai Won Ton soup is 170 calories."}
{"text":"The WORST airport food ever. Girlfriend got the Mongolian Beef. I got the Beef fried rice. They truly stretched the definition of BEEF. Both our dishes looked questionable. I gave up on mine less than halfway through. My girl had some of mine...flight attendant on the plane walked by and asked her \"is that beef?\" No joke.  Unfortunately, my girl threw up as soon as we got home to Vegas. If you make the flight from Phoenix to Vegas...WAIT till you get back to Vegas to get some grub."}
{"text":"I thought I ate here before, couldn't remember so I took a shot.  It sucks.  Ordered Kung Pao chicken.  It was deep fried and felt like some one emptied the entire salt shaker into my food.  I am writing this review to remind myself never to eat at this place again! I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered.  Don't let the smell fool you.  Get the pizza next door instead...."}
{"text":"Airport food is airport food.  Food and service here is subpar. There are limited seating available in the dining area. But don't worry, everyone has a flight to catch so they'll be up and moving in no time. The busters here are slow to move. Patrons, including myself were waving down staff to ask for dirty trays and dishes to be removed so we could at least have a clean eating area to enjoy our meal. After asking two workers to remove dirty dishes, I figured I was better off busting our own table myself since no progress was made. I walked over a tray full of dirty plates to staff in exchange for an unpleasant look on her face. It didn't bother me though.  Food is as good as the service. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken over steamed rice. The vegetables were not thoroughly cooked and tasted raw. My pre-cooked chicken was cold and not fully heated. I had a starving belly to satisfy and finished my food nonetheless. Bad idea, I got a terrible tummy ache after.   Although this is one of the few dine-in restaurants available in the airport, I suggest you steer clear from this place. You're better off eating chicken nuggets with a side of chocolate frosty at Wendy's. On a lighter note, they do have a bar so this place may not be too bad if you're in for a drink...only."}
{"text":"Nothing special here, but convenient and quick food to grab before a flight. The Thai wonton soup is pretty good, the bowl sized portion had about 5 wontons. My friend ordered the lo mein and it was pretty tasty, I added some of the noodles to my soup to make it even better. Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Got the spicy chicken while waiting for my flight. What attracted me to this place is that you could see them cooking up the food, since its an open kitchen.  Also the chefs were Asian as well. The chicken is lightly fried and has a spicy sweet and sour sauce.  I also upgrade my rice to fried for an extra $1.  They can pack it up to go so you can make the people on the Southwest flight jealous too! I hope this helps!"}
{"text":"I, like most folks, like Pet Wei. But wise man say, Airport Pet Wei not as good as Street side People Wei. Or something like that. The translation gets lost on my Anglo Saxon tongue. Had the 'Chicken Sausage, Bacon, Fried Rice with Hash Browns'  And yes, it is as funky tasting as it sounds. But maybe they would do better with 'Stir Fried Oatmeal' or make a 'Breakfast Dumpling? Anyways, not a good breakfast choice."}
{"text":"Pei Wei makes its way to my top 10 list.  Only, the list is for the top 10 worst restaurants I have ever had the displeasure of eating at.  This fake Panda Express wannabe took twenty minutes to fulfill my single order of chicken fried rice.  One would conclude they would mass produce their dishes because they only serve a whopping ten items.  Yet, service was slower than watching water boil.     I was not the only one waiting for food, which made the wait that much more miserable.  I felt the pain of every customer around me.  Whether the slowdown was due to the cooks, or the cashiers, or the lack of quality control at the pass, they all should have felt the same amount of guilt.    When my number was called, all the angry customers gave me a disgruntled look.  What they were all thinking was why did this guy get his food before me?  However, I simply ordered the easiest dish to prepare.  I bet seeing me get my food pissed them off even more.    As I made my way back to my seat, I was excited to be finally able eat my food that I waited so long for.  The excitement was short lived once I opened my to-go container.  Inside, burnt chicken, burnt rice, and burnt broccoli was discovered.  If I liked burnt food, I wouldn't have been too disappointed.  However, the whole dish was just bland.  The shredded carrots annoyed me, if that is even possible to be annoyed by food.    I feel like an infant throwing a temper tantrum when I think about Pei Wei.  It was disgusting, and the wait fueled the fire.  This place really needs to have management access their core values and give the employees a pep talk.  Until that day comes, be prepared to wait a lengthy time for substandard, almost inedible food.    0/5 rating if possible.  Stay away.  Just drink water or wait for airplane peanuts."}
{"text":"I like Pei Wei. I really do. There is one by my house that I visit regularly. I find them tasty, quick and affordable. As a frequent traveler, seeing one at an airport was a nice break from the standard eats - mediocre burger chains and overpriced sit-down establishments.   Or so I thought. First, the place has no noodle dishes. Zero, zip, zilch. Strike one. Their kitchen really isn't that much smaller than a standard Pei Wei. Is it really too hard to have noodle making capabilities?   What they do have is fairly limited. A few dishes without, it would seem, the ability to customize much. Kung Pao Chicken? Sure! Kung Pao Beef? No way. This obviously screams pre-made.  I did have said KP Chicken, which was oily as all heck. Like seriously...the Saudi guy next to me had never seen so much oil. Yes that's a joke. A bad one. Get over it. In addition, I ordered it extra spicy, which meant I was given a container of barely spicy sauce. Sign two for pre-made mediocrity.  The meal did the trick and was fairly priced for airport food. Two people could easily split it and be fairly full if they weren't treating it as a big meal. However, I'd rather have the burger chain or overpriced sit down place. At least I'd get a product vaguely reflecting what I'm used to."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and it didn't even taste like chicken. The brown rice was stale and hard. It's over priced and gave me an upset stomach. Stay away from this place"}
{"text":"New to reviews. Was about to post had review meant for a different restaurant at the airport. And I can't figure out how to delete. Sorry. Though I have had good experiences at Pei Wei before."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Chinese at the international terminal!!!!  Thankful and Grateful!  Pei Wei Spicy Chicken lived up to its spice and it was gluten free. I have practically given up eating Asian takeout so this was a nice surprise. This is cooked to order and a few steps above Panda Express so it works for me. What a great surprise.  The pricing, well it is at the airport so I have to add $5 to the price of the average item. I did not order wine, that was priced a little high, I would hold out for the bar at that price."}
{"text":"The only Chinese/Asian restaurant in McCarran Airport; located in Terminal 3, E Gates.  There was nothing exceptional about customer service, after all, it's fast food.  The food on the other hand was greasy and tasteless, not to mention, it was also overpriced. You look at your food and you can tell that whoever prepared it could careless.   I do not recommend this place, if you are craving for Chinese food, I suggest waiting to get to your final destination or some place else; do not waste your money nor have high expectations because you're guaranteed to be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a joke!  Not a true representation of pei wei.  Awful service and the food was awful.  If your gonna do it, do it right!  The girls working the Dining room nothing short of rude!!"}
{"text":"Def not worth the money. $9.99 for a \"spicy\" tuna roll which I only was able to eat 2 pieces of because the rice was hard. No spice or flavor what so ever. Also got the lo mein which was weird. Huge random pieces of \"chicken\" and the bottom was drenched in sauce so I literally ate some of the drier noodles on top and that was it."}
{"text":"No thanks.  I came here because the name and logo sounds so healthy; so light; so refreshing.  It is none of those things.  I had a \"japanese terriyaki bowl\" with brown rice.  It was literally drenched in terriyaki sauce.  I recommend inquiring whether it is possible to order sauce on the side.  The vegetables were dripping in some sort of oil.  You may as well just go to Burger King or Carls Junior down the hall."}
{"text":"Very good food, yummy and made to order. The size is enough for one easily. Just expensive and they didn't give us soy sauce (biggest disappointment)."}
{"text":"You would think Vegas would have a better food selection in their airport, but after spending 20 minutes walking through the terminal, Pei Wei ended up being the best choice.  I ordered the honey chicken. The cashier was not particular friendly. I personally know that working at the airport sucks (my first job was working at Starbucks at Sky Harbor), but a smile wouldn't have killed her.  I found a seat at the crowded bar and ordered a glass of wine while I waited for my meal to be brought out. The bartender asked me if I wanted 6 oz or 9 oz, and of course I went with the 9 oz. Then I got the check... $17 for a glass of wine! The wine was good, but not $17 good. I know it's the airport, but I had a double vodka soda at the Tucson airport for $11.  It took a while for my food to come out, but thankfully, one of the bartenders was super friendly and kept conversation going while I waited for my food. The food was okay. The chicken was pretty good, but the rice and crispy noodles were bland. But for $10 at the airport, you could do worse.  I think Pei Wei is probably your best bet at McCarran International. I would definitely sit at the bar. The bartenders were really nice, and so were the other patrons. It definitely helps take your mind off the fact that you are in one of America's ugliest airports."}
{"text":"Chain Chinese food in an airport .... Desperate times called for desperate measures.     I arrived to LAS hungry and I just learned the 1 hour flight delay turned into a 2 hour delay.   I needed food and a cocktail.   $19 for 9 oz of wine - crazy but yes I had 2 one for each hour of my delay.  Springs rolls fried but not dripping with grease. Chicken Teriyaki with brown rice - kudos for having steamed brown rice but the chicken was tasteless.  Spicy chicken with brown rice - it was edible.  White meat chicken covered in chili sauce  -- more sweet than hot.   Warning the sushi is packaged and was not enjoyed by a fellow stranded passenger.  I was talked out of the Banh Mi sandwich because it was also packaged.    I'm sure I'll be back just not by choice."}
{"text":"Look it's airport food ! But it's a nice option to pizza and BK burgers. Or crappy sandwiches.   I sat at the bar had spring rolls and spicy chicken with brown rice.  It wasn't spicy by my standards but it was decently good fast Chinese food. The bartender was pleasant and the had a lot of drink specials.  Overall was an ok meal for the airport."}
{"text":"Overpriced I expected, lousy I did not. Silly me.  Tried the sesame breakfast croissant with bacon, egg and cheese. Regrettable and I would return it if I didn't have to hustle.   First off it was not sesame (they told me after it came that they were out), secondly I took it back because it had no bacon (they dissected the sandwich to point out that there was bacon it was just so small I missed it under the crap-ton of sauce the drowned the thing in) and thirdly, the egg was way over cooked and had burnt crunchy portions, yuk...ended up throwing most if it out.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Came here to grab brunch before our flight. The options are limited to rice dishes and salad wrap (which seems popular with the older ladies). I however opted for the breakfast fried rice which includes sausages, bacon, sautee cherry tomato and your basic fried rice faire. Its fairly decent size and quite good. Its not authentic and the rice seems a tad soft but overall it really hit the spot for me. Very satisfying without being too filling. I would recommend this as a great place to eat something warm and no nonsense before the long flight."}
{"text":"Over-priced mediocre quality Asian food, on par with Panda Express. However, when stuck at LAS & craving Chinese food, this was our only option! We got the steak fried rice and asked for the meat on the side. They did not have any vegetarian entree options. It wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but it wasn't good. My boyfriend said the meat had no flavor, probably because they did not stir fry it with the rice. The rice was dark and salty, and had only small bits of vegetables in it. It got us through the night, but we would never willingly eat there again."}
{"text":"The \"Spicy\" Chicken was not spicy at all and was served luke warm. I ordered a small drink only to find out they only have soda to choose from - no iced tea. They directed me to the bottled drinks for the iced tea and all they had was sweetened choices. So, it was a disappointing lunch. Too bad because Pei Wei is usually good outside if the airport. They did have gluten free advertised on their menu so that was a good thing - hence two stars."}
{"text":"If you aspire to have high blood pressure,  then this is the place has your name all over it!  Ordered a Kung Pao chicken,  had more sauce than the gravy in your Thanksgiving dinner. I slammed water for every bite I took. In addition to that, I blame my bubble guts on the under-cooked egg roll.  the agonizing search for the nearest restroom. The service was efficient and fast, but you may be better off at a Panda Express for the $12. I smell pizza next door!! (_)"}
{"text":"Was craving some Chinese food after a fun Vegas trip this was the closes thing I could get and barf! no flavor and the noodles wow nasties things I've ever eatin only gave em 2stars bc the employees were nice. Horrible food"}
{"text":"Same as any other Pei Wei, customer service was very depressing. We all get tired at work but don't give me your attitude. Other then that glad the cooks made food good. Place was clean but gets packed quick!"}
{"text":"With the Memorial Weekend, My friend and I got to the airport about 1.5 hours before our flight. Knowing that libations were the determining factor, the bar at Pei Wei looked decent enough.  A glass of red wine was $14 each and upon ordering, the lovely bartender said the bottle would be $29. Of course, a no brainer! We ordered a spicy chicken with lo mein and a California Roll.  The chicken and roll were modest at best. The lo mein was just egg noodles, without and seasoning or veggies. The wine was decent. Problem was that we were getting ready to board our flight and not to leave any of the wine behind, we knocked off the bottle.  A bottle of wine for two in 45 minutes. My friend fell asleep upon boarding and during the entire 1 hour flight home."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I need something to eat during our layover so we stopped here. Aye aye aye :/ There weren't many people in line and there were 2 people at the cash register... We waited about 20 minutes just to pay for the premade food we took out of the cooler. Everyone in line was incredibly frustrated by the ridiculously slow service. We made it back to our gate just in time to eat before they started boarding the plane. I feel like in an airport, service needs to be very efficient; people may not have a lot of time between flights to wait around.  Anyway, the food: we got a sushi roll ($9.99) and a spicy mango chicken wrap (I think it was $7.99). The sushi was definitely overpriced - I would normally pay about $6 for a roll like this at the sushi counter in a grocery store. It did taste fresh and was slightly better than I expected for the airport. The mango chicken wrap was really good, healthy, and filling. Again, I felt it was overpriced but that is to be expected when traveling.  Pei Wei is an off-shoot of PF Chang. The menu items sounded delicious but we did not have time to place an order and then wait even longer for food. If I have the time, I would stop here and give them another chance."}
{"text":"Love Pei Wei and so sad that they closed the one where I live. So whenever I am in the airport I make sure I stop by.   I usually get the Teriyaki chicken with fried rice. Comes out to $10.00. Good sized portion.   The line can get pretty long and sometimes it can take awhile to get your food. So if your short on time you might not want to chance it."}
{"text":"Always busy. Always fresh. I always eat here on flight home. I think the food here is exceptional for a fast-fresh restaurant. 4 stars is generous but 3 stars is unfair. Chicken chow mein is excellent."}
{"text":"I had To go to this place as all the restaurants were closed at the airport. Had the worst spring rolls here. They gave me 2 spring rolls for $5.19 and the size was very small. The taste was pathetic. I will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Date: 06/23/2014  From now on, I will be saying, \"No way, I don't want Pei Wei (pronounced \"Pay Way\")!\"   I have tried a Pei Wei retail establishment in Columbia, MD, and the food back then was just as bad as the food at Pei Wei Asian Diner at McCarran International Airport.  Why Pei Wei in Las Vegas?  My travel companion wanted Asian, and it was the closest place to our gate at the airport...  We both got steak fried rice, and she ordered an additional entrée for her boyfriend.  $9.69 Fried Rice $1.00 Steak Add-on $0.87 Tax  So...  Speckle of shredded carrots, couple of baby pieces of uncooked broccoli, bits of other vegetable here and there, and very bland, uncooked rice with slices of steak in a to-go container...  Why in the world have I lowered myself (again) to eat this so-called crap Asian food?  P.F. Chang's, you have failed big time!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst! The cook (I can't even think about calling her a Chef) burns egg croissants slathers it when mayo even though I asked for no mayo and then when the cashier reminds the 'cook' about no mayo, the cook flings another egg onto the griddle - no respect for food nor concern that her customer is watching!! It's a shame the cashiers have to deal with this - they were great but as far as the cook!!! She is he reason I will never spend another penny here! Awful, awful experience!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Great service at the counter. But the lady who dropped off my food to the table is miserable, didn't even acknowledge me. Gives that \"great I'll go fuck myself\" feeling. She totally ruined my vibe after breezing thru TSA. Please tell your staff to smile (fake it in front of the customer, it's what I do)."}
{"text":"The chicken was cold and really sour. I was hoping maybe it was just a random bad piece... I was wrong. Half of it was cold and the other half was mushy and barely warm. The server also had a terrible attitude, cursing under her breathe, and rolling her eyes at co-workers saying they did this and that wrong. I was already next in line and I figured give his place a try. The soup's spinach was fresh which was the only saving grace. When I received my food, I asked where the utensils were and a server just pointed. No looking you in the eye and saying anything, very poor experience. AVOID if you can."}
{"text":"Had the Pei Wei spicy chicken plate with brown rice. Good part: good flavor, snow peas were fresh and crunchy. Bad part: brown rice was under cooked and chicken was battered and deep fried. Portion size of rice was huge, while chicken and veggies were small. Good for me since I don't eat large portions, but may not be enough for others. Overall, not bad for airport food."}
{"text":"Thiis place is what its reviews say it is.   In no way does this compare to non-airport Pei-Wei locations.     I had Mongolian beef and despite the long wait - which duped me into thinking my dish would be made to order - the beef was definitely dry, barely warm, and judging by the beef jerky like consistency, quite possibly from the Jurassic era.  So if you enjoy arthritis of the mandible, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Rude counter help with horrible attitudes. Luckily the manager was there, chatted with her about her staffs attitudes and she comped my dinner which was unexpected but greatly appreciated. Whatever the staffs issues are, they need a lesson in unemployment to maybe help them appreciate what they have. Food was just ok. Two stars because of the manager, otherwise one star."}
{"text":"This make the worst bahn mi sandwich I have ever had. Flavorless. Limp produce. Lesson learned. Never again."}
{"text":"food quality and taste better than I expected . but I think I know why this place only has 3 stars. The Service is just not professional unlike the food. if they replaced all the employees then this place should be boooooming"}
{"text":"Ate here because was waiting for flight. The food had so much sauce on it I could not eat it I had the lettuce wraps I would not order again. Also was expensive for something I could not eat"}
{"text":"Five star here simply because one employee knew what vegan was, didn't look at us sideways, answered all our questions, got us our food accurately in a timely manner and went about her business in a pleasant way. You can't really ask for much more out of an airport Pei Wei, can you?"}
{"text":"So sorry for any guests who've had a negative experiences here. Im the evening Wok Cook, Wednesday thru Sunday. Our motto paraphrased is to make hand-made, quality food, quickly but fresh for each and every single guest. Although I try my best to make sure the entrées that I serve are up to my own and Pei Wei's high standards of quality, not every person that is involved in the process of creating your food cares as much as I do. All I can do is control how I conduct myself as an individual and as a food service worker I pledge to honor my responsibilities safely to provide fresh, high quality food, promptly for your enjoyment. Thank you."}
{"text":"Worst Pei Wei location I've been to. Extremely slow service. I was the only person in line and had to wait for the employee to finish portioning sauces before she would help me. Once I ordered it took almost 20 minutes to receive my food...a single order of Mongolian Beef with Brown Rice...again I was the only order they had. Once I received my food it was the smallest portion of beef I have ever received, the sauce was super runny, and the beef had none of the crisp exterior it normally does. To top things off I didn't even get a fortune cookie. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"This place is slooooooow.   Good is overpriced for the portion.  It was also greasy and it took a long time to receive it.  The had three cooks, but put out only one order every two minutes."}
{"text":"Got the lettuce wraps attempting to be healthy before my flight home. The chicken mixture was incredibly greasy.  I could see the oil pooling on the bottom of the dish, not what I was really expecting.   Service was fast, price was ok, but man I wish my dish was prepared more on the healthy side then it was."}
{"text":"Context is King. And in the context of \"it's airport food\", Pei Wei is King.  It's fresh, reasonably-priced, and fast.  Hell, I was doing a Whole 30 when I flew through here and was even able to find compliant options.  More so if they hadn't been out of some of the menu items, so docking one star for that.  Otherwise, stop here and eat better than you could ever expect to in an airport."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Pei Wei since I left Arizona, moved to California, and realized that Asian food was supposed to taste like. That said, there were one or two dishes here that I quite liked, so when I was at the Vegas airport and options were limited, this seemed like the best of the choices we were presented with.  The selections were limited, being an airport location. The service was average. The food was REALLY oily here today, to the point that my friend didn't feel well after eating here.   You're probably better off getting a powerbar at the airport convenience store, and waiting until you land to get real food, elsewhere."}
{"text":"Mediocre to bad, even within the realm of airport/mall \"Asian\" food. The spicy chicken was anything but (I would've guessed sweet and sour, but mostly sweet), and the Mongolian steak had 3\" long strips of raw scallions. It also took a good 10 minutes to get my food and they weren't even busy. There's better options at the airport for less money."}
{"text":"Girl wasn't friendly and passed us off to another cashier to place carry out order.  This used to be a place we went all of the time.  After placing order I asked for a cup for water.  This girl doesn't know her food handling skills.  She placed her fingers on the inside of my cup just after she was handling money.  There was another girl who got me another glass.  I don't even know about the food yet...should I even eat it if this is what they know here???"}
{"text":"After a long day of climbing, I was rather disappointed by the bland chicken lo mein. Was filling but overpriced and lacked flavor."}
{"text":"The restarant has an overall comfortable feel to it. The bartenders were both very nice. The mimosa I got was $15.80! What!? I realize that this is the airport but come on!  Also because it was 8:15 am decided to get the bacon and egg fried rice. Huge mistake! Tasted like the cook added about 3 tablespoons of black pepper to the dish. Tasted mostly like soy sauce infused rice with scrambled eggs, onion, and undercooked bacon with a TON of black pepper. And it was $8.50! Sorry Pei Wei Asian Diner...I'll remember to steer clear of you in the future!"}
{"text":"Isn't Vegas one of those places that never sleeps? Well, at the airport, most of the shops were closed by 9pm...on a Friday? Ok fine.   Japanese teriyaki with chicken was what I ate. It was not bad. I kinda liked it. The veggies seemed good. The white rice was good. The chicken was good too. The sauce was pretty good too. Maybe I was starving after a 5 hour flight, but I thought it was pretty good. It wasn't fast though, rather it was made to order with semi prepared ingredients.   Based on the options I saw when I was there, I'd probably eat this meal again."}
{"text":"For Airport meal what else could you ask for fresh food that's not a burger not sure why people hate on the place my lunch as very good."}
{"text":"SLOW!!!!  Only one cook and one register.   Couldn't make it through line and wait in 20 minutes"}
{"text":"Yelpers beware - the reason for the 3-star review is not due to food/service...it's due to the fact there is NO Pei Wei at 7676 E Pinnacle Peak Road in Scottsdale, AZ."}
{"text":"Pros: I'd come here again for the music. Daft Punk, Zero 7, Ellie Goulding, Kings of Leon, etc.  The staff was courteous and the food was good.   Cons: Limited menu. Prices are about 30% higher than a non-airport PW.  Seating is cramped.  No ice water."}
{"text":"This was a nice Pei Wei for an airport.  Food was good. Wait time wasn't bad.  They are not the fastest, so if you have a flight to catch this isn't the place to go!"}
{"text":"Okay so this restaurant review is the last one from my Milwaukee to Las Vegas flight.  We had a two hour layover before we flew out from Las Vegas to SFO. We wandered around for awhile, that airport has a lot of restaurants. Well this place was actually good. The only complaint is that they were out of my first two selections. I had the Mongolian Beef, the meat was so tender it was ridiculous. The sauce had so much flavor. Pretty good review for airport food right?"}
{"text":"I certainly miss having good local food like in PDX but given the options, Pei Wei was alright. I got my Kung Pao chicken to go and it came out piping hot in less than 10 minutes. For American airport Chinese, the food was decent - I had four or five big chunks of lightly breaded and fried chicken. There wasn't too much breading and it was all meat, not fat and grizzle like some places give you. The sauce was sweet but not too much so that it drowned the rice. Overall, it's not healthy food but okay if you didn't have to time to eat before your 5 hour flight and you arrive in Vegas famished and still have another flight to go."}
{"text":"Please get me to a panda express, stat. Pei wei is on the low end of fast \"Chinese \"food which is a terrible category to be at the low end of!  I enjoy real Chinese food, but had low expectations for this restaurant and was still disappointed. I had a beer and the spicy chicken entree. spicy is a total joke because the only flavors in the dish were sweet and sour sauce, almost definitely out of a jar, and salt, lots of salt.  The food was pretty bad and cost $16 for one entree and a Miller lite. It's an airport. What can you do? Eat somewhere else! The Lady at the register was very friendly though."}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost unless you are ready to wait a long time. Food is good as are all Pei Wei's. Customer service and wait time are horrible."}
{"text":"we had a layover in las vegas coming back from a cruise and i was starving!  i'm so use to eating like 24/7 on a cruise that my body got use to it and wanted food at all hours.  since we still had another flight, i didn't want to risk eating at the other places that didn't have a gluten free menu, so we ended up here.  the line moved quickly and i let the cashier know that i had an allergy.  my allergy didn't show up on the receipt so we double checked with her, and she assured us that my meal would be made gluten free.  finding a table here sucks and is almost impossible if it's busy.  it shares the dining room with a bar and it's pretty noisy.    i ordered the gluten free pei wei spicy chicken.  i normally don't get chicken (unless i know it's organic or free range), but they didn't have a shrimp option which was disappointing.  i also ordered it mild since i don't like spicy food.  the food came out quickly and was not good at all.  very soggy and sweet.  i almost thought it was sweet and sour instead, but no it was the spicy chicken.  i kind of forced myself to eat it and made a mental note to myself to pack more granola bars and snacks when traveling."}
{"text":"More like 2.5, rounded up to 3 only because it's airport food and you lack options. Otherwise I would never eat here by choice. It really bothers me when menu descriptions are inaccurate. If your chicken teriyaki is breaded, please state that! Especially when chicken teriyaki is, in general, NOT breaded, even if it's a light layer of breading. Decent flavoring.  Otherwise, this place is sufficient for when you're at the airport and you tire of the same old fast food, Italian, or Mexican options.  Plus points: I do like the veggies that come with the my chicken teriyaki and brown rice that comes as a complimentary option. Also it seems like they make your food to order  Warning: I've only had a couple of bites of my food so far and my breath is reeking!"}
{"text":"Always a bit skeptical of food joints inside of airports, but this place was pretty good! Ordered the low mein before my flight & it went above & beyond what I expected. Would order from here again."}
{"text":"Great staff, very friendly and quick service. The food was delicious. You can't go wrong with their Mongolian steak."}
{"text":"Wow.. Asian cuisine wok cooked. I'm impressed and love the food. Came pretty close to PF CHANGS food. I ate the fried rice and steak. Really stuffed at the Phoenix Airport. Would definitely look for Pei Wei Restaurants out there now."}
{"text":"I had some pieces of chicken that were not fully cooked. The rest of the meal was average at best to be honest. Im sure other locations are better but i would not recommend this one"}
{"text":"This is one of the rare places in an airport that had good food.  Service: 4/5 -I recommend the steak fried rice. Be prepared to wait however. We waited at least 15 minutes and luckily was able to board our flight in time.  Food: 4/5 -Surprisingly the steak was tender, not dry or tough. The brown fried rice had just the right flavor and salt content.  -Avoid the honey seared chicken. In no way was this seared, it was fried. The batter and chicken was sadness with every bite"}
{"text":"If someone at this restaurant is willing to do this to a Sheriff Deputy, do you REALLY think an average customer would fair any better?! - - - - - - - - - - - - - Maricopa County Sheriff deputies felt threatened and concerned that a Pei Wei employee might tamper with their food when they were ordering during a recent food break.   A manager remarked that the deputies were responsible for arresting too many of the kitchen staff at the restaurant.  It was suggested the manager who made the comment may have been referencing MCSO's recent crackdown on illegal immigration.  According to the Sheriff, the Pei Wei employee proceeded to offer to cook \"something special\" for the deputies.  The deputies, according to the Sheriff, felt threatened by the remark and returned their food, worried about food contamination.

{"text":"Everyone raved about the food at Pei Wei. The line was long and slow. I had to catch my plane. So after a 30-minute wait, I grabbed a wrap from the open fridge, added a cup of broth and ice tea. The broth and iced tea was great. The wrap was packed with pickled everything. It was weird, but I ate it. Not sure if I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"I grabbed a bite here in transit with a friend.  The line in front of the restaurant combined with the lack of any line at neighboring restaurants suggested that this was a popular option.  I had also heard good things from a colleague who said that Pei Wei was a relative of PF Chang's, a well established gourmet chain of Far East cuisine.   I ordered the Caramel Chicken because I liked the sound of it and because it had the \"spicy\" icon listed next to it on two overhead LCD menus.  Additionally, because I felt the need to flaunt my wealth, I decided to upgrade from standard white or brown rice to premium fried rice for an additional  $1.00.  Ballin'!!  (Insert perfect Steph Curry 3-Point shot follow-through here).  I also gave into an impulse purchase: a somewhat pricey brownie at the counter.  The brownie wasn't good.  I ate it, but I kept thinking about how disappointing it was as compared to how good it looked.  That said, no one comes to Pei Wei for brownies.  The Caramel Chicken with the premium fried rice was decent.  The sauce tasted great but I thought there was too much of of it. The mixture of rice to chicken to veggies was on point.  I got a milder form of the post Chinese fast food brick in my stomach feeling -  better than usual.  Overall, OK."}
{"text":"Pei Wei has to be one of the best fast food places.  Quality food, consistently good and usually taste the same in any one of thier shops.  Friendly service and alwasy tasyt food."}
{"text":"This review is for the warm and friendly service provided to me by Cindy.  She greeted me with plenty of options for food and offered a double drink for additional $4. It seemed pretty basic for an airport restaurant and smelled like old grease.  Either way,  I sat/conversed with some cool people who were mostly traveling for business and could not really expect more of an airport restaurant"}
{"text":"Gotta love those lettuce wraps. The line moved quickly and the employee at the register looked seriously sick of her job but was still helpful.   Food came out quickly and was everything I ever wanted from Pei Wei. We don't have these in Portland, so I get excited easily. Will be back next time. Although hopefully I'm not in Vegas for a while. I'm over Vegas right now. Can't believe this day has come."}
{"text":"One of the only decent options in this terminal. First time eater. Had the Caramel Chicken with white rice. Good portions and pretty flavorful. The spring roll on the other hand was not a fan of. If you're in the airport, go for it."}
{"text":"Not very much seating. The food is made to order and relatively fast. Service is prompt but not that friendly. Pretty good place in terminal c for food. Full bar next store with television."}
{"text":"It may not be the best Asian food ever, but this Pei Wei is nice, convenient, and a welcome alternative to the burgers and fries or hotdogs offered in the rest of the airport.  Is it a little greasy and a bit too salty? Sure, but for $15 total, you're not gonna get a Gordon Ramsay entree or sustainably raised free-range chicken with organic farm-fresh greens in an airport  Fine for what it is"}
{"text":"I'd give them a 2.5. It cracks me up that their menu calls its food inspired by Asian cooking. True. This obviously isn't authentic, but sometimes you're just craving some soup or noodles. I had been traveling all day and already had 3 meals so I just wanted something light. I got the Thai Wonton Soup. It wasn't hearty by any means, but I liked the taste of the wontons."}
{"text":"Having to leave Vegas after only two short nights is bad enough, but being in a terminal with not a lot of food choices when you're getting ready to be on a plane for five hours makes it even worse.        But just when I thought my last Vegas meal was going to be some boring traditional egg thing,  we spotted Pei Wei, and could it BE?  Yes, non-traditional breakfast!  Even regular menu if we wanted it.  Score!       We plopped down at the bar for some nice hydrating iced tea to go along with our breakfast choices:  breakfast sandwich for Husband, and Breakfast Fried Rice for me.  Oddly enough, my rice dish came with a couple chunks of fried hash brown type things, which I gladly tossed to Husband.  I had enough carbs to contend with.    I tell ya, loved that fried rice!  It was full of all kinds of delicious morsels, like bacon and sausage and veggies including bean sprouts.  This was seriously good and I never ever want to know how many calories were in it!    Now that we had our proper breakfast, it was time for a proper pre-flight dessert.  Glass of chardonnay for me, and Makers neat for Husband.        All topped off with excellent service from a friendly Bartender."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food is always good.  Service, mediocre at best. How about a \"good morning\" nothing just stand there stoic. Too early? Too late? Deliver food to table, toss the bowl on the table, in the middle of the table not in front of me - picky?  I don't think so. How about a thank you or have a nice day. Nothing.  Maybe this location is staffed by mutes - that would make sense."}
{"text":"Ugh?! I understand why airport food has a bad reputation, but Pei Wei makes McDonald's sound gourmet. I had an hour layover and wanted some lunch. There was a huge line outside Pei Wei and so I thought how could I go wrong? I had the Mongolian beef with brown rice, while my friend had the kung pao chicken with brown rice. We also shared an order of pork egg rolls...  The food was beyond a disappointment. Everything was extremely over salted; I literally felt as though I was eating spoonfuls of salt. I seriously could not get myself to eat more than several bites, because I was sooo incredibly thirsty. It really makes me wonder why so many people were waiting in line, yuck!"}
{"text":"Stopped and ate here during a lay over in Phoenix. Food was good (same as any other Pei Wei) but customer service was lacking. Ordered a Mongolian steak plate and a chicken lettuce wrap appetizer.  I asked for extra special sauce for the lettuce wraps but was refused.  I asked again and was told that \"it's only soy sauce\" several times.  I'm pretty sure that special sauce is not just soy sauce, though not 100% sure...that was only bad experience here."}
{"text":"Crap service, to the extent that when I tried to pay my bill I was told \"I'm not clocked in yet, you'll have to wait\".  15 min later I got to sign for my check."}
{"text":"The bar is super crowded. Like whoa. I'd prefer to stand and get pushed around than sit at a high top table and feel stuck.  That being said, the to-go menu was appealing. For $11, I got the honey chicken with brown rice. It tasted like a healthier General Tso's. (But it probably wasn't.) Good quantity for a high airport price. I waited about 10 minutes for the to-go dish."}
