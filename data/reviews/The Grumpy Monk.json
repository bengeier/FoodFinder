{"text":"First of all the craft beer was  served warm. The menu says BBQ. The only pulled pork they serve was pulled from a tub sitting in the freezer and microwaved. Nasty sandwich. We also ordered the calabash seafood platter.  It was served with more grease than Jiffy Lube. We complained to our waitress but never saw a manager after waiting for 30 minutes. Never again!"}
{"text":"Went there with my wife on Monday for lunch....initial impressions are the restaurant itself looks very nice and warm to initial invitation...the wait staff are all energetic and very accommodating....however, the food left a lot to be desired....I had the club with fries and my wife had the beef grinder....neither one of us was pleased with the food...her beef had no taste and the tots were not very good....I had the club which was okay but the fries were very soft and not cooked properly....I would have sent the food back but we were in a hurry so we took most of it in a to go container....threw it out once we got home....get some cooks who know how to cook food please..."}
{"text":"Came here on a quiet Thursday evening last week with my dad because I wanted sushi and he wanted bar food. It turned out to be the perfect pick for that. We started with the comical but tasty \"monk turds\" appetizer which basically was fried pepper stuffed with cream cheese and a couple other things. For dinner my dad got the burger with a side of wings, both pretty good. Something different about the wings was that it seemed like they smoked them before frying which added a good backyard Barbecue kind of element. I ordered the sushi appetizer (3 cuts of nigiri and a California roll) and a cucumber wrapped roll recommended by our waitress which consisted of cucumber, imitation crab and cream cheese sitting in a white wine vinegar sauce. It was a good switch up from my usual choices of rolls. Our waitress was fun and attentive and we enjoyed the ambiance of the place. There is a good variety of menu items which will keep everyone in your family happy. Good burger, good wings, good appetizer, and decent sushi. Definitely will be back to sample their local beers next(; 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place needs to just save the trouble and go ahead and close the doors. It's a mad house with a wait to be seated over an hour and there are more tables empty than there are full! It won't make it in this town like that and it damn sure won't work for me! Pull the plug!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday around 9:30, 2nd day open. Bar was full, but had no wait. Our Waitress Emily was great, very attentive. Had the green bean appetizer, very good. And the French dip entree, delicious. Very nice roomy open space. Plenty of tv's. Great experience. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Bad service, and really bad food.  My wife ordered the 1/2 chicken and it was cold in the middle.
They made her a new one and the manager brought it out and it was also cold in the middle. Then the table behind us complained because their food was cold.  I sense a pattern here. I do not recommend this place. Crab dip had very little crab, mostly cheese. Only thing good was the salad, thank you mother nature. It is not worth 1 star in my opinion."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place but will not be excited to go back. We were seated promptly on a Monday night and our serve came over quickly. Ordered drinks by the only beer menu is a rotating screen on the TV which is annoying and hard to read with the small print. We ordered crab dip to start and the chips were stale. My husband and I both ordered burgers and the fries and tots were crispy but the burgers were terrible. Cooked to our order but my husband ordered the Avocado Burger and the \"avocado sauce\" (usually known as guacamole) did not have any avocado in it. We had to ask for it on the side. Also the burgers are frozen patties. Not worth the price. Overall the food was not fresh and for a new restaurant with lots of other mediocre competition, I was not impressed. Likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.   Service was good, tea was week with an after taste, monk burger was pretty tasteless.   But the food was hot and filled a void"}
{"text":"This is a new location and new for Monroe so we decided to try it one evening. Our server was one of the most interesting people that's ever waited on our table. He was pleasant, entertaining, and efficient. I say this, because it was the most memorable part of our visit. While the food was not horrible I can honestly say that I have no recollection of what I ate other than that it wasn't bad. (Im writing this a few weeks after our visit)

We are planning on returning to try a few other items, and I do recall that the sushi was good, but unmemorable. Hopefully on our next visit they will have gotten their act together as I do recall that service was slower than I would have liked coming out of the kitchen. However because of our fantastic server I'm adding a star to my rating."}
{"text":"Tried it out tonight. Found it lacking and a disappointment on many fronts. 
First beer selection is so so given the name and marketing. I didn't see a single true Belgian beer on the list(no triple nor quad. I guess they consider blue moon a Belgian. 
 Second appetizers were 50/50 
Chicken wings okay a bit over sauced. Monk \"\"turds\" were just that burnt to  a crisp. 
 Entrees were also 50/50. My oldest son liked his burger and the younger likes his chicken tenders but these kids will eat almost anything including chips out of s bag. My wife wasn't thrilled with her wrap though but I only evaluate what I eat it is only fair. 
 What I can really talk about is my smothered chicken. 
I ordered it without cheese because there are not too many truly healthy choices and we are basically talking about grilled chicken with vegetables when you eliminate the cheese aspect. 
When it came it was tougher than shoe leather. I let two other people at the table try it and they agreed. Garbage!  
The service was also not that great. 
This place is not for anyone expecting more than an Applebee's or Showmars type of meal in quality with a Lonestar Outback type price. 
Myself personally I would rather spend more for a better meal and experience or honestly less for the same. The grilled chicken nuggets at chic fil a would have been much better than the chicken jerky I was served 
 No pride was taken in any aspect of this meal from the service to the preparation. 
 The fact that we were essentially fined $81 plus a tip for the experience was fine by me. I deserved it but won't return for more punishment."}
{"text":"I ordered American pride and the Alexa brought them to our table the service was great and she was pleasant the wings had great smokey flavor the burger was very tasty and tasted fresh the fries were crispy and not greasy. the beer was very cold and delicious"}
{"text":"Just opened last week. In the parking lot in front of Target on 74. Has a lot of potential. Sushi was delicious! I think even better than the local sushi places in Monroe. Lots of fun craft beers on tap. Beer menu is posted on a few TV screens around the dining area. Was difficult to read from our booth. Our waiter suggested reading the beer list from the Untappd app, which I actually had, but it would be nice to have a print out of the beer list. Even if it changes frequently, just print out a basic list that each server can have daily. Lots of TVs around, will be great for game-watching. A little chilly inside, I saw a lot of females shivering. It's in an old steakhouse building, so there is an outdoor side patio area that has a lot of potential as a beer garden. Waiter definitely could have been faster. The place was busy, but it took longer than it should have to get water, straws, the check - things that aren't influenced by the volume of the kitchen/bar. Said he used to work at the Grumpy Monk in Myrtle Beach. Definitely Myrtle Beach prices! $6-7 for 16oz craft beer, $13-15 sushi roll. Husband got a mushroom swiss burger and fries, which he liked. I got grilled tuna on romaine - salad was HUGE! Very good homemade ranch dressing. Will definitely give it another try once their growing pains wear off."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and we live pint night and trivia night. Slower service sometimes as it gets busier. There is so much on the menu that we love from shrimp to burgers to tacos."}
{"text":"Average food. Kinda over priced. The wings were nasty. VERY over cooked. I asked if that's how they were normally served and they said yes. They looked mummified. The oysters smelled to high hell but tasted great. Overall not worth the drive or money."}
{"text":"Tried the sushi and it was terrible! Drenched in eel sauce and every roll tasted the same. Not fresh"}
{"text":"Third time I have tried this Grumpy Monk and each time have had poor service and unsatisfactory food. This time was by far the worst. Went in for lunch around 1145 and ordered the fried tomatoes that came out burnt had to send those back. Mind you this was a very slow time of day we were the ONLY people in there. Waited 45 minutes for entrees and decided to leave. Slow service and the manager was very rude and didn't seem to care about his establishment."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Kara took such good care of us. My wife and I each had a delicious salad and everything on the menu looked good. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and slow service even though they weren't busy. Skip the veggie pasta primavera. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Great food and love the atmosphere. Really good beer.  They just opened so service was a little slow while they are getting their legs, but they were so nice and apologetic. Really great place."}
{"text":"Cute concept! Sushi & large selection of craft beers?! They sold me on that! 

The menu offers other bar bites like wings, burgers and sandwiches. I had one of their several  interesting rolls & the fish quality was pretty decent. (I can be a sushi snob). A TV displayed information on the draft beers they had available so that was interesting! 

The Bartender was super nice but I think they were understaffed. There was only 1 other large party in the restaurant & the staff seemed overwhelmed. Food took a super long time to come out & everyone in our group received their meals at different times. 

We didn't have small plates for our apps or napkins/silverware. A lady in my party helped her self to grab us what we needed & slipped on the wet floor. :0 

I think this place has potential but needs to work on a different system to provide more efficient service."}
{"text":"this was a totaly fun place to have dinner and the food was really good as well. if you are near one of these make sure you try it out. they had a huge selection of beers as well."}
{"text":"The service was good. Our waitress was very helpful with allergen information. The fried pickles were great and the sushi was very fresh. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was bad and the service was awful. For the first time in thirty-five years of marriage I saw my wife sent her water back because it tasted funny. So then she orders a beer and we have to ask for a glass. We get the appetizer and have to ask for plates, Her food was burnt beyond recognition, and mine was just terrible. 

 There is an item on the menu called \"Monk Turds\" which is offensive and shows the mentality of the management. 

 Not a chance if it were free would I go back there."}
{"text":"Bad service my husband and i wait 45 min for a table and have 6 available but they forgot,  later we wait for waitress and order and the food it's cold, the comeback with the food reheated, nasty We don't comeback super bad experience"}
{"text":"This was our second visit. I tried 2 of the featured drinks, both were very flavorful and tasty. The chicken nachos were amazing! I hated that I could not finish them all! Our server was polite but very busy. We waited about 10 minutes for a glass of water. The prices were reasonable and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Sydney is an awesome bar tender! She recommend and poured some great drinks and had great conversation with her customers. She knows how to treat her customers right. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is aiight, the drinks be bussin!!! the food is pretty good. the customer service is Excellent"}
{"text":"New restaurant in Monroe.  Opened for 1 week.  Wait time 40 minutes on a busy Friday night.  The waitress, Taylor, was very friendly.   Our food was delivered in record time of about 10 minutes.   Nice open restaurant.  Music could be turned down a little so you could talk and be heard.  Give it a try"}
{"text":"This place seems to be a cross between a pub and a sports bar. The beer menu is on TV screens along with any number of sporting events all around.
We went looking for burgers and were very pleased with them. Mine had onion rings and a spicy sauce while my husband had one with peanut butter on it. Tots for a side and buffalo chicken dip as an appetizer. 
Our server was pleasant and attentive and we'll certainly be back the next time we are in a buger-eating mood."}
{"text":"We went during a slow time..around 4pm on a weekday. We were greeted with a smile and seated immediately. 
It took maybe 5 minutes for server to arrive and ask for our drink orders, but she was very sweet...smiles a lot,  courteous and happy to describe various items on the menu. She was attentive from then on, making sure our drinks were refilled,  and we had everything we needed. 
My black bean burger came within 5 minutes of ordering. It was was delicious..very tasty, but be warned it does have a bit of a kick. If you aren't into spicy foods, it may not be best choice for you. The tator tots, a bowl full, were crispy and good , but after 3-4 of them, I was quite full. 
I was happy to see a few interesting vegetarian and vegan choices on the menu.. will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here looking to try out this new restaurant that everyone was talking about well let's just say I'm not impressed at all. 

Hostess sat us quickly, right where we could see in the kitchen and server came over about 5 minutes later. We all orders burgers (mine medium) and waited for about 25 minutes for our food when it was not even busy at all. Finally, burgers came out and my burger was BURNT!! 

Our waitress was no where to be found for a good 10 minutes. We finally flagged her down, and showed her the burnt burger. She then came back with a plate and told me to put the burger on it so I could keep my onion rings. She took it to the kitchen (about 3 steps away) where she told them the problem. ****** I watched the other server ask her what the problem was and our waitress told her the burger wasn't cooked right. The other server then said \"just tell them to F*** off\". My boyfriend, who was with me, then walked into the back of the kitchen, pissed off, and asked for a manager who did nothing to fix the problem! 

Never will I be back"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and the food is \"ok.\" Standard bar and grill type food. However, they must be having problems getting servers or they need to retrain the hosts. If a restaurant is half empty and you tell me there will be a wait to be seated, I'm not staying and not likely to return. This has happened twice. The food would have to be so much better for me to wait when all I see is empty tables."}
{"text":"I went with a large crowd and service was friendly & quick. Had the Rueben which had good flavor but the bread was saturated with grease. I'll have to give it another try. The menu has a wide variety: burgers to sushi which is a little different..."}
{"text":"Attentive service. Lots of TV screens and beer menu is also on monitors. Sushi was very good."}
{"text":"Great food. Great beer selection.  Just pay attention to details at bar like washing hands after handling food plates that have had food devoured.  Just a health tip.  Otherwise, great personalities and great service."}
{"text":"Our server Casey was delightful and attentive. The food was fresh, fast and good. A little pricey for lunch, hope to see lunch specials soon. Will dine here again"}
{"text":"Our first and last time here.  Two people were at the hostess booth, neither took names, just asked randomly how many were needed to be seated.  A few of us, gave one of the women, our head counts.  We were a party of two, after us was a party of 4, and then there was another couple who came in afterward, followed by larger parties. Everyone before us was seated, and everyone after us as well.  ... we were still waiting.  The other hostess, realized we were still waiting, apologized, and seated us immediately.   

While walking to our table,  our shoes were sticking to the floor.  We arrive at our table, and noticed a towel thrown on the floor near us.  I'm assuming something spilled?  Waitresses simply walked over it.  


I ordered the Reuben sandwich, with a side salad.   The sandwich arrived sitting in a pool of grease. The bread was soggy.   I tried to blot up as much grease as I could before tasting the sandwich.  My first and only  bite, consisted of fatty bits of meat, that I had to spit out.    That was strike three...I was done eating.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Clean and chain restaurant type feel. The food is good and the sushi is fresh and great quality!!"}
{"text":"I first learned of this place in Myrtle Beach.  I passed by it on my way out of town thinking I would try it next time I was in Myrtle.  On my way back to Charlotte, same trip, I happened to pass another restaurant in Monroe with the same name.  After looking into it I found it was the same place and this was the second location.  A couple of nights later I had the chance to stop by for dinner and here's what I have to say:

Its a cool looking place with a cool name, nice beer list and a fusion style menu.  We walked into the restaurant that had a fountain display of taps pouring water into a vat - awesome!  The beer list was displayed on a tv screen that changed every ten seconds.  Pretty cool unless you needed more time to look at the page or forgot what you wanted to order.  You were forced to wait for the screen you needed rotated back through.  Regardless my wife and I ordered our beers and began the hunt for the perfect dish.  

In the seemingly random menu of burgers, sushi and sandwiches we opted for some wings, nachos and a couple of sushi rolls.  Our waitress comes by after giving us about five minutes to look at the menu and says \"the bar is taking a while to get your beers ready so I came back to see if you were ready to order,\" so we did.  After about another ten minutes or so I had to ask for our beers which were obviously forgotten.  Our waitress apologized and rushed to bring them.

What seemed like a long while later our food arrived.  We started with the two sushi rolls and I must say I was not disappointed.  I actually enjoyed them.  I finished my roll and moved to my wings and guess what...no blue cheese as ordered.  No biggie because I had the nachos which were really good too.  I will say this is the point I realize that our waitress was hard to catch up with.  I think we waited about ten minutes, probably a little less but it seemed like a long time, to see her again and once we asked for the blue cheese it took another several minutes for her to return with it.  I think my favorite thing were the wings.  I ordered the how wings and the sauce was very zesty, a very, very slight sweet aroma but nothing I've ever had before.  Kuddos to the saucier that created that masterpiece.

I gave this place two stars for the overall service alone.  The waitress was a sweetheart but the delays, mix ups and feeling forgotten brought this group way down.  BTY the water did not taste good at all.  I'll give the the obligatory second chance...we shall see."}
{"text":"2nd day open.  1st to review.  How cool is that?

It's a Saturday night got there around 9 pm we were promptly seated and our waitress was very quick to arrive at the table.  My wife and I had the fried green beans for starters and arrived very hot and fresh.  They had a nice crisp texture and the ranch was nice touch.  

My wife had The French dip with au jus which was the right portion size and the taste was very good especially with the au jus. 

I had the monks buffalo chicken (minus the lettuce and tomato) with provolone cheese and fries.  The bun was toasted, the chicken breast was very large and the reading held the buffalo sauce very well.   This is one of the better buffalo chicken sandwiches I have had.  The portion for the fries were a little weak but the sandwich made up for that.  

Overall I would give 5 stars for the 2nd days performance as we all know for a Saturday night in the food business can be a little rough even if it wasn't your first weekend open. 

Service was great, our server was attentive and the food came out hot, correct and in a very timely manner.  

Congratulations on your new location.  Will definitely be back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Went for father's day dinner wait was about 15mins at around 6ish. They wait staff were turning tables pretty quick. Beer selection is largest in Monroe. Apps came out quick as well as the salads, dinner on the other hand took about 20mins after apps came out. Dont think the pub style menu  was anything special for the price."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. The hangover burger is delicious as well as the chicken nachos. Great new food specials on Saturday and Sunday. Really good beer and cocktail menu."}
{"text":"By far the best IPA selection in Monroe, NC and by far your best sushi in Monroe, NC. If your wanting good beer and sushi you should definitely go."}
{"text":"How can you not stop to at least check out a place called \"The Grumpy Monk\"? I mean it's something you have to at least see what is happening. Now there is the chance that it's not even a restaurant - who knows what they offer inside? It could be some sort of spiritual rest area.

As it is situated in what appears to be an old steakhouse, it is in fact a fast casual dining establishment. They are mostly a sports bar, with plenty of screens on plenty of events, depending on when you visit. There are also a reasonable number of local brews on lists displayed on other screens, though they could slow down the list a bit, as it generally goes by too fast to figure out what is being served on a given day. The good news is that the staff is helpful with going over the list.

Inside is very open - it's like they cleared out all of the booths and tables and put in about half of what was there. In fact, it looks almost too open. It's not bad, just... different.

We have actually been a couple of times, and on the first visit, service was off-the-chart friendly. The second visit, not so much. The food, advertised as being 95% made in-house (may or may not be true, and the percentage is probably high) is solid, and an interesting mix of fast casual fare and sushi. Yes, sushi. Haven't figured that one out. Prices and portions are good on the pub-style food, at least."}
{"text":"Overall, our family of 6 enjoyed our visit/meal (2 adults + 4 kids). 

The service was great, food was solid. I had a cheeseburger and my wife tried a few various sushi rolls. We loved the emphasis on FRESH and LOCAL.

The ONLY downside for our experience was the cost. With no alcohol, we still racked up an $75 bill (before tip). Not complaining- it was great food. I'm just not sure we'll commit to a $93 family-meal at the Grumpy Monk when there are other comparable options nearby for around $30 cheaper. My wife and I will definitely be back though."}
{"text":"Party of 3 adults. Bathroom was clean. Service was good.  Seafood platter was good. Fried pickles app was good. Bloody mary was terrible.  Philly sandwich with side salad was well received.  Finally the plain chicken wings were a complete disappointment. Over cooked, seemed burnt. We realized after we ate that another tables wing app must have gone back for the same reason.  $75 bill. Overall we see  no reason we will be going back.   Eating out should be an experience, not just okay."}
{"text":"The grumpy monk is a great family restaurant with something for everyone!  The build your own salad is amaZing and huge!  It comes in a large glass bowl!  The fried chicken strips are delicious!  There is a peanut butter burger for those looking for something different.   This restaurant also serves sushi!  Great local place!"}
{"text":"The good:  kids grilled cheese and tots were great.  Shrimp tempura roll was pretty decent and only 3.99 for a half roll.  Craft Beers were half-off. OMB copper for the win. 

The bad:  the BCC fries were absolutely disgusting.  0 flavor. Both fries and cheese were cold.  The fries had no crunch to them, tasted like they weren't cooked through at all.  The cheese sauce was flavorless as well.  The rolls came out 15-20 minutes before the rest of the food.  No idea how that happens as the fries were an appetizer.  My daughter had to use restroom, she said the bathroom was disgusting.  The menu is priced at a premium, the food is definitely not at that level from what I experienced. 

Suggestions:  make sure your fries are fresh throughout the lunch time hour, use real cheese on your bacon cheese fries.  If I wanted nacho cheese fries, I'd go to a minor league baseball game."}
{"text":"This will mark our 4th and last trip to Grumpy Monk. We have tried ciders, beer, soda, water, iced tea sweet and Unsweetened. Fountain drinks and water smell and taste bad Monroe water and no filtration system ugh!!
As you walk in the place a draft fountain greets you in the door lock which many times smells like chlorine. This experience I smelled smoked meats. I didn't see smoked meats on special though, maybe it was wings, idk. 
We were seated as usual quickly. Plenty of tables here and booths.
Several booth seat pads need replacing due to age and cracking. This doesn't sit well for those in shorts or skirts. 
On previous visits our food has been hit and miss. Fresh fish sandwich was awesome first time and had skin on second time and tasted very spoiled. Could not eat. Crab cakes are mushy. Mac n cheese is boiling hot and a huge side portion. Very smooth sauce but not particularly flavorful but makes a great kids meal choice. French fries are always hot and nice but you only get ketchup if you ask for it and only in a small amount. Hamburgers do not taste fresh and the buns don't taste fresh. Grilled buns should be toasted with butter or some fat and these didn't help the burger. The French dip was much better and the bread was great, au jus was nice but meat over done and dry. 
Salads are the best here, side and large ones. They always taste fresh and flavor full. Dressings while served in small portions are delicious. 
Chicken wing are huge but need to be cooked longer just too chewy. Saucy and presented nicely on the plate though. 
Sushi is a wild adventure here. Traditional is ok but the contemporary styles including bacon and beef are really amazing. Monk roll with chicken was delicious. Great bar food idea and fun to eat. 
The servers seem bored. No matter what time we eat there service was prompt from the kitchen. We like the waitstaff but have seen only Joey more than once. Friendly guy! 
They run drink specials but never on cider and choices are dictated by takeovers of the tap. 
I keep coming back thinking I will order just the thing that will make me come back for that great food item. But it hasn't happened yet."}
{"text":"My husband & I were excited to try this place because the building had been empty for so long.   We had a great server, but the food was mediocre & NOT competitively priced for the area.  The only condiments on the table are salt & pepper, so be prepared to ask for any condiments you might need (i.e. ketchup, mustard, Heinz, sweetener, etc).  Burger patties have a very strong charred taste (even at medium cooking temp)."}
{"text":"Have been here twice.  First time was ok, second time, not.  We had a turkey sandwich & it was processed turkey.  Salad had crackers ON it & the wrappers were very dirty."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner a couple times. Each time the service hasn't been great. It takes forever for them to get to you and they are never around to get you refills. 
The food is pretty good. We have gotten server all different appetizers, they were great. I absolutely love the pulled pork sandwich. It's one of my favorites and the only thing I will order from here. Well the last time i was there, I set in clear view of the kitchen (by the cashier stand). On the very bottoms rack next to the floor were the hamburger buns, they were open and one was hanging out, about to fall on the floor. There was a guy cooking right there and his leg was touching the bun and it touching the shelf it was sitting on. This grossed me out so much because I then saw another person come and grab the buns to use. I really liked the food here and was overlooking the crappy service because I liked the food so much.... but now I am hesitant to go back."}
{"text":"Tried the Grumpy Monk tonight....
I well say that the hostess was great...
Our waitress, well, she took our order, and brought our check, oh yes and did plop a second iced tea at our table....
The food it can be gotten  pretty much anywhere, nothing jumps off the menu, just your basic fare...
As for this being a new restaurant in town you would think that you would get a visit at your table from a manager on duty...NOPE ...Did see what we thought might be the MOD, climbing on the booth to close a set of blinds, yes climbing on the booth with patrons all around....
One and done for me...."}
{"text":"It's the second time we've been here... We have had a great experience both times!!! Second time here, we sat at the bar and Stevie was the bartender. He is super friendly and very knowledgeable on the Beer menu. We had the sushi, which was excellent! If you save your itemized receipt you get 10% off your next visit. We are definitely coming back!"}
