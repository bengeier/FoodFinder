{"text":"My time at the Westin was far from great when it comes to breakfast. I ate at the Marrakash Express. The people here are the rudest I've ever met. I just wanted a sandwich, for goodness sake. One girl in particular, very rude. I told her that she is being rude and told me I'm rude. Just because she hates her job doesn't mean she needs to be angry with every customer. This as the WORST experience! 1 star for the girl that was nice and tried to diffuse the situation. Save your money and nerves and grab a juice somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is a coffee shop deli in the hotel and if your looking for a quick breakfast, lunch or snack this is the best option in the area.  The coffee is better than the sandwiches and even though its a bit pricey its still cheaper to eat here than Rick's Cafe which is one of the few other lunch options in the area.  They have a larger selection of other convenience store type items here as well."}
{"text":"We made plans to grab coffee and breakfast sandwiches prior to our early morning flight the next morning and they were closed.  We were there at 5:35pm and they advertised closing at 6:00pm.  No note, no reason... just closed.  In business, do what you say you will do and be there for advertised hours."}
{"text":"It is a very conveniently located breakfast place but the service needs to be improved. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and they told us it will take about 5 minutes. After a minute or so they put out a breakfast sandwich and my son grabbed it thinking was his. Thank God, I pay attention to my surroundings there's a lady who is browsing near the beverages and I told my son that should be her's. We asked her and she said yes. As part of the customer service, the store staff should know who ordered what and who get first. They didn't say a word while we sorted out our own. I hope Westin management team will look into this because this is one of the best resorts I ever stayed."}
{"text":"Starbucks coffee, amazing chocolate croissants.  Absolutely to die for.  Deli options as well. Did not try them but they looked very fresh."}
{"text":"What a fabulous coffee shop! This place had a nice selection of made to order Starbucks coffees, as well as breakfast sandwiches, lunch options, and all sorts of healthy snacks. 

The staff is rather friendly as well, which always makes the experience that much more enjoyable!"}
