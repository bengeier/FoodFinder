{"text":"Fantastic experience here. Atmosphere is cozy, service is excellent and attentive. Pizza, pasta, beef carpaccio etc all excellent too, and reasonably priced. 

Although every table but one was full when we arrived, service never wavered, very prompt. 

Overall a solid experience. The decor is a little dated, but it's inoffensive enough. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant, the staff, and food are great. Whether it's fish, pizza or pasta, the food is delicious, my husband loves the bruschetta . This is the best Italian restaurant in town"}
{"text":"The sheer number of restos in the Davisville area of Mt. Pleasant will knock your socks off. The problem is that they're so nice that most of them don't do takeaway. Sick to death of eating sushi for my weekly meetings in the area, I decided to try Positano after seeing a bunch of Zagat stickers on the door. I'm so glad I did!

The menu isn't classic Italian necessarily -- they have some different takes on things. I ordered the Farfalle Rustico -- roasted butternut squash, chicken, arugola, and fresh plum tomato sauce. The portion was generous and they also give you fresh bread and freshly made tomato sauce to dip it in. For $16.50, it's a steal.

The Best Part?! Right before walking out I asked if they had plasticware since my food was to-go.  He didn't even blink and offered to let me take one of their pieces of silverware. All he asked was that I return it if/when I had time! How frickin' awesome is that?! Of course, after my meeting, I popped right back by and shoved it into the mail slot just like he told me to.

Excellent food, excellent prices and super excellent service? A definite must-try."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the best customer service experiences I've experienced at an italian restaurant. The first time we went there, we didn't have a reservation, so we couldn't make it in. The owner was almost apologetic that we didn't get to eat, and gave us their card so we can call in the next time we came in. 

I'm glad we decided to go back. We got lucky this time coz there was hardly a crowd as it was later in the evening, past 8:30pm. The attending staff was super attentive, and engaging, made sure our table always had food/condiments while we were waiting for the main course. Although I wasn't bowled over by the choice I made, the food was good.. and different from what I'm used to.. especially coz I've had a lot of italian food in the past. My only bone with this place is that I wish they had a lot more vegetarian options. I'd live here if that were the case! 

Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Dining at Positano was a lovely experience.  First of all, service was exceptional: attentive without being constantly in your face. 
We split a bruscheta and Positano pizza (spinach, goat cheese, chicken and sundried tomatoes).  Both were very good, and more than enough for two people.  Oh, and their bread and especially tomato dipping sauce were delicious.

For desert I got a lemon tiramisu and my companion got an affogato.  Both were an excellent way to finish the meal.

The restaurant is on the smaller side, so if you are planning to eat on a Saturday, come early (or late)."}
{"text":"Great place, authentically Italian. I went here for dinner and the service was unparalleled. The menu was fresh and the variety of pasta we ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent service at this warm, friendly neighbourhood restaurant. The sweet sausage and penne and the pizza were delicious.  The pasta was fresh and impossible not to finish. The gnocchi was delicious, delicate and the perfect comfort food.  The salads were fine but the standouts were the pizza and pasta. Highly recommend Positano for a casual, reasonably priced dinner. Park in front of the restaurant (at cost) or on a side street.  Reservations are recommended on busy weekends."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Positano, prompted by the excellent reviews on this site. We were not disappointed, and shared a wonderful meal with our out-of-town guests who were staying in the area. 

The food was exceptional, the service warm and welcoming. 

We chose from the nightly specials...all dishes were perfectly prepared wIth super fresh ingredients and nicely presented.

It's not anywhere close to our neighborhood, but definitely worth the trek across town!"}
{"text":"The service is great. They can always somehow make my glass of water full all the time even though I keep drinking it :p  Also I think the staff are friendly. 
The food is decent too. I would recommend everyone to try this restaurant out"}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner. It's a very small spot, so I would call ahead and make reservations. Great specials on food and wine. Very New-York type feel."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here and it was honestly a fantastic experience. I've been to Italian restaurants before, but this one is definitely a standout. Not only was the food amazing (the gnocchi was so good, we also had the pizzas and that was made with fresh tasting ingredients), but the service was even better. The staff was simply superb - very nice, polite, and warm. I didn't get the names of the two gentlemen that served us, but I think they provided me with the best service I've ever gotten in this city.

I would definitely recommend dropping by. The prices are just right and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Have been here 7 times. They've outdone themselves every single time. Great food, killer service, great atmosphere. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is good.  I had the insalata tricolore (everything's lower case here), which was actually mediocre, but my pasta dish made up for it.  

Of the 10 pasta dishes, 6 are fully vegetarian, and the rest can be made so.  (Don't panic, they had lots of meaty specials too.)  

I've had a lot of so-so pasta over the years, but my linguine syrenuse (rapini, black olives, mushrooms, roasted peppers, garlic and olive oil sauce at $13) was delicious.  Best pasta dish I've had in as long as I can remember.  My cousin chose the salmon special and said it was excellent.

All the dishes I witnessed here looked and smelled great.  Next time, I may try another pasta, AND order a pizza \"for the table\".

We didn't have dessert, as we opted to go to Il Gelatiere, a few steps north on Mt. Pleasant.  Check it out...http://www.yelp.ca/biz/il-gelatiere-toronto"}
{"text":"It is like like eating at my grandma's house. Homy great Italian food, love the antipasto, nice service. They also do take out. Highly recommended for good Italian good."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this place regularly and always go for special occasions. Every time I come I always leave happy and satisfied. Their specials change up frequently, but I find myself ordering from there most of the time. The actual menu is really good too. If you're looking for real Italian food, look no further. Staff are super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"First, I want to declare that I think Positano is a great restaurant, albeit the 3/5 stars I am giving it.  The staff members there are friendly and attentive! They noticed that I was feeling a little stuffy in the restaurant after walking there from Eglinton Station and immediately turned on the AC for me without asking!  They also checked up on my party a few times during our dinner. It is quite obvious looking at the reviews of others as well as the expressions of the customers around me that this establishment is well-regarded.  However, for me personally, I am not a big fan of Italian cuisine and there was no \"wow factor\" that got me to change my perspective on Italian food.  The food was cooked well, the presentation was decent, and the flavour was pleasant. I just wasn't blown away, that's all.   Compared to other Italian restaurants in the area, the prices were similar or a little higher, but that shouldn't deter anyone since their prices were not vastly different. 

The pizzas are well-reviewed, so I may give them a whirl in the near future.  Don't quote me, but I think they may be better than their pastas - we shall see!

For any fans of Italian cuisine, I would still recommend you to give Positano a try!"}
{"text":"We dropped in here on a Friday night when the restaurant down the road we had reservations at was unexpectedly closed.   Pleasantly surprised by the high quality food and presentation.   Very attentive staff. Portions were not too large or wasteful.    I would come back here if I were in the area!"}
{"text":"I was searching for a good place for dinner near my hotel, and when I found the reviews of Positano on yelp, I headed out to find it. Unfortunately, it was a Monday night, and Positano was closed. I really wanted to try it, though, so I went back on Tuesday night and was welcomed by a friendly server. The menu lists starters, pastas and pizzas, but the main courses are described by the server, and they all sounded amazing. I chose a grilled sea bass, served over veggies and potatoes. Just know that the price for the specials aren't given unless you ask (which I failed to do), so expect something around $30 for a main. 

The fish was prepared well, but the highlight of my night was the bread and tomato sauce. While most Italian places serve warm, fresh baked bread with olive oil for dipping, Positano serves their bread with homemade tomato sauce. It's absolutely to die for. It tastes creamy and makes the bread melt in your mouth. I normally try not to eat a lot of bread before a meal, but I ate 3 pieces, and went through 1 and a half dishes of the tomato sauce. Yum!!! 

I'd also recommend the lemon tiramisu. It sounds strange, but it's a great, light dessert for summer."}
{"text":"The best kind of find! A neighbourhood restaurant that uses high quality ingredients with a master chef that makes magic with simple dishes. It's the kind of place you almost don't want to share with people because the food is so good. You don't want it to get too popular! The staff and service is impeccable, polite and seem to genuinely care that you're having a great time. It's been around for over 20 years and has not lost it fine food quality and charm."}
{"text":"Tried to go here before Christmas and the place was packed. We wised up and made reservations this time. This small restaurant has a wonderful ambience and a very attentive wait staff. I had the penne, and my date enjoyed the gnocchi.

The price is pretty standard for a nice night out, with our bill coming to just over $80 with tax and tip ( this included a half liter of wine).

I would recommend this place for a nice date night out, or a special occasion with the family."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Wow. Went for the first time on Good Friday and have been thinking about it since. First off, atmosphere is fabulous. Quaint, cozy, and no TVs (which is apparently hard to find?). Our servers were excellent- friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, and gave us our privacy. We ordered the bruschetta not knowing that we would receive complimentary bread and homemade tomato sauce for dipping. Both were great. The bread and tomato sauce was a novel idea and the bruschetta was also novel- on crispy pizza dough with fresh tomatoes. For fullness' sake we probably did not need the bruschetta after all but enjoyed nonetheless!

For mains, we had the agnolotti fiorentina (ricotta and spinach stuffed pasta with tomato basil sauce), farfalle rustico, and the pansotti alle noci (stuffed pasta in walnut cream sauce). I had the pansotti alle noci- and my god, no words to describe how delicious this was! A tad sweet in taste because of the walnuts, but a wonderful nutty creamy sauce and delicious pasta. My fellow diners also enjoyed their meals. The prices were great- I was very surprised the mains were around $15 and I expected lesser quality but obviously did not experience that. I believe the meat mains are more pricey, but still reasonable.

We took the lemon tiramisu home for dessert but did not eat it until the next day so it didn't hold up that great. Maybe don't take it home? Meant to be eaten straight away.

We also enjoyed the Chianti Vernaiolo '12 ~ Rocca Delle Macie wine and I liked it so much I tracked down where to buy a bottle. Wonderful!

Highly recommended for anyone wanting a sense of occasion without being too fanciful. Try the pansotti alle noci!!!"}
{"text":"It's a simple and comfortable restaurant offering friendly service and great food.  Prices are high end especially for a casual restaurant but the quality of food justifies it.  The eggplant parm was delicious and explosive with taste,  the gnochi slightly stickier than desired but the tomato sauce,  cheese and cherry tomatoes made this dish very tasty and enjoyable.  Finished with a lemon tiramisu which was the first time I've had and it was incredible.  All in all,  a great meal. 
I prearranged for a cake and candle for my wife's bday but the staff had completely forgotten about it. I suppose it can't all be perfect."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Positano, it was a Sunday evening so the restaurant was not that busy. 

We were seated quite quickly, I order the Pasta di Sicily with Sausage, the walnut house sauce with penne, and a dessert. The food came out quickly and the service was quite good. The restaurant itself is very clean, a bright atmosphere with friendly staff who actually speak Italian. 

I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Incredibly good food, nice cozy atmosphere, good prices, sincere and fast service.  Wonderful place for dinner.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"great food, atmosphere and great sever!
i recommend try their walnut cream pasta!!"}
{"text":"Positano's is a staple in my family, with a family member going at least once a week! It's a very friendly restaurant with a real family feel. It is casual, yet nice enough if you want a celebratory dinner. Due to the family-friendly feel, children are more than welcome here, although you won't see them running around or disrupting things. 

The wait staff are wonderful here. Everyone, including the owners are so warm and welcoming, and if you want to come on a Friday or Saturday night, you had better call ahead for a table because it is not uncommon to see a group of people standing at the door trying to come in and then have to be turned away because they are all booked up! If you are a regular, the wait staff truly makes an effort to get to know you. They know exactly what every member of my family will order every time we come - they might as well start preparing the dishes the second we walk in the door!

The menu is not huge, but they have pretty much everything you would expect at an Italian restaurant. If they don't have exactly what you are looking for, don't be afraid to ask. They are very accommodating and open to making substitutions. For example, I don't like mushrooms and they will gladly replace the mushrooms in the pasta primavera with asparagus or another vegetable. One time I was feeling like having some calamari in my pasta, and although this is not found on the menu, they happily made this for me. Although they do not have a specific children's menu, they will definitely custom make dishes to order for the little ones!

All in all, a wonderful and welcoming Italian restaurant that serves amazing food and does not feel pretentious. Take a visit there - it will be well worth it!"}
{"text":"Dinner on a Sunday night - excellent service!  Totally on top of it wait staff.  Good to order their antipasti platter - everything fresh, roasted/grilled to perfection (fennel, zucchini, red bell peppers, garlic cloves, asparagus, etc.)  Had the shrimp fradiavalo pasta - interesting spaghetti noodle texture - didn't taste like DeCecco or Barilla or Garofalo pasta - perhaps it was house made?  Good sized shrimps and portion was filling.  Pizza there is paper paper thin - very thin in fact that it is like a cracker.  Very good if you like that kind of texture.  I've walked by this place many times (after hitting Il Gelatiere for true Italian gelato) and although it didn't disappoint, the food didn't give me the wow factor to want to go again and try another dish.  Good price point and their good service may, though."}
{"text":"Tucked away on bistro dominated, Mount Pleasant Road, Positano Restaurant is a hidden gem. This place is packed every night with loyal customers returning for more. The menu is simple and is comprised of salads/starters, pastas, pizzas (thin crust) and nightly meat specials. Yet there is something so satisfying when you get a steaming plate of pasta put in front of you and the bill doesn't break your wallet. This restaurant is extremely well priced for the value and the wine list is a steal as well. Top notch service makes the cramped settings a pleasure to dine in. My favourite dish is the farfalle pasta with squash, goat cheese, chicken and spinach. The best is that they serve you bread with their home made tomato sauce to dip. 
Check it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pitiful experience at Positano
 
Do you enjoy cold, dry and stale bread before your meal?  How about under cooked, still visibly raw pizza dough? And do you like paying an exorbitant amount of money for the displeasure of it? Well, then hit up Positano and you'll be positively thrilled.  I do not know how this place possibly has such a high rating. Let's dig in to the details (but not the food - bleh).

0/10: The bread and tomato sauce appetizer everyone raves about. Maybe we just got unlucky, but I've rarely had such obviously week-old, dry, stale bread at a restaurant where they have the audacity to charge $9.50 for their house wine and $12.50 for Bruschetta (tomatoes and bread - really?). I didn't even like the sauce. It had almost a fishy taste... maybe anchovy?

5/10: Pizza positano - Positively pathetic. The too-thin crust, being under cooked (you could see it was still glistening and raw under the layer of spinach that covered the entire surface - even Popeye wouldn't be able to handle this much spinach in one serving. The other toppings on it: sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, chicken were decent. The psicy oil that came with it was gross. And Il Sogno (in the area) has a far better spicy oil - but their food is overall even worse). I even did take the pieces left home to see if it would taste better fully cooked, but it came out chewy, tough and leather-tender. 

7.5/10: Gnocci tricolore. This was the only saving grace of the meal. And it was supposed to be all MINE. But my date  insisted on taking half and I almost stabbed him with a fork when he tried to take ¾ of it -he was the one who wanted the pathetic pizza!  I wasn't even interested in that.  Anyway, gnocchi was soft, and flavorful, but did need the extra Parmesan and black pepper served table side.

4/10: Service. If ONLY someone had come to ask us how our meal was - we could have sent back the pizza. But they dropped off the food and never asked how it was. I would have sent it back but my date kept eating it, regardless... How? I don't know. When we had half a pizza left, I tagged down a waiter and mentioned that it was underdone. He apologized a lot, but then said \"I wish you would have told me earlier so I could have done something - could have fixed it.\" Um so why exactly, can't you now? You can't make us a fresh half a pizza - or give us at least 50% off - or a free dessert or glass of wine? Yes, they could have done any of those things, but they didn't offer - and I wasn't paying, and that's the only reason I didn't push.  I was also unimpressed that our waiter did not give him name.  Service 101 is that you greet your diners by saying \"Hi, name name is ___, and I'll be your server tonight.\"  No one made pleasantries and chatted with us.  The only reason they don't get a 0 is because - even though the waiter didn't do anything to fix our problems, he did apologize - and we were able to get a seat without reservation at a 6pm on a Friday.

Positano is possibly the worst of the Italian restos in the midtown area. If you do make the trek, the fresh, homemade pasta seems to be the only good thing. And at $15.50 for a vegetarian dish of the cheapest pasta, I think the place's prices are as inflated as their ego. I'd advise true lovers of fresh Italian cuisine to take a pass on the positively forgettable Positano."}
{"text":"We ordered Farfelle Rustico and Halibut. Both were perfect. The portions were generous. Staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Friday night and enjoyed both the food and the amazing service! Restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived around 7PM but was full when we left. We ordered a 1/2 litre of red wine (Chianti, decent value at $26) and split the caprese salad to start. It arrived on two plates which is always a nice touch! For mains we shared one of the specials, steak with balsamic reduction and arugula salad, and a pasta dish with chicken and butternut squash. Steak was great and pasta was good although somewhat average. For dessert, we shared the lemon tiramisu. More like a lemon sponge cake than a tiramisu, it was delicious and a good-sized portion. Overall felt like decent value, I believe our total bill was about $110.

Based on food alone I'd give the restaurant a 3 star rating, but the service really bumped it up a notch. All the staff in the restaurant were very friendly and polite, and genuinely seemed to be enjoying themselves. There were a few tables of what seemed to be regular customers, and lots of smiles and laughs from the staff throughout the restaurant - it really made for a great dining atmosphere, felt cheerful and relaxed. I'm looking forward to going back again (and maybe becoming one of those regulars)!"}
{"text":"We got the pappardelle with veal Ragu. We also got another order to take-out. 
The calamari was a must-get and for dessert the cannoli was delicious.
The pasta sauce with bread was interesting...would have preferred olive oil and balsamic vinegar."}
{"text":"Decent quality Italian place in the Mt Pleasant / Eglinton area. Not the only one but it's a decent choice. Resto is small and tables are hard to come by especially on weekends as there seems to be a lot of regulars. Still we got a table for two without any reservations, at 7pm on a summer Friday night. Parking is also a challenge in the area but residential areas provide some spots, you just have to be patient and drive around a bit (or just pay for a spot).

They brought us bread (white crusty bread, a bit cold but reasonably fresh). And warm tomato sauce for dipping -- a bit different from the usual olive oil/balsamic approach but also much more filling!

We had grilled calamari (shared app) and then gnocchi and tagliatelle for the two mains. App was $15, mains were $18/$22.

The body of the calamari was very very good -- nicely done, not rubbery, lots of flavor, on a bed of shredded raddichio. But the tentacles came completely black -- basically two pieces of charcoal -- I don't know what the chef was thinking -- he could have not plated it and we wouldn't have been any wiser. But when it was placed on the table, my wife poked at it with her fork and the waiter immediately recognized that it was not edible and took it back to be replaced. The owner then came over, apologized and explained that it's hard not to burn the tentacles. Really, it was not that big a deal, it came back right away but it was almost comical, starting with the chef plating it and the waiter serving it, with neither one noticing (or caring) to begin with.

The mains were very good. The tagliatelle was a special so you may not see it regularly -- it had wild mushrooms and smoked chicken which was very tasty and tender. The olive oil/garlic sauce was heavy on the garlic so if you like garlic, you'll love this dish. Pasta was cooked perfectly. 

For dessert we had an almond flourless cake with vanilla ice cream (so so) and an affogato (because they ran out of the lemon tiramisu although it was only about 8:45). The affogato had too much espresso for the amount of ice cream, because the hot espresso basically melted ALL the ice cream; I basically drank the final third. It tasted OK but I wouldn't order it again.

As we were packing up, I noticed that the table next to me also ordered the same tagliatelle dish. But it had nearly twice as much pasta vs what I got?!? I wouldn't have been able to finish it -- I was plenty full with the amount that I got. But I couldn't help but wonder whether they favoured regular customers or something. 

And as we were paying the bill the owner came by with two complimentary shooters (Limoncello liqueur) and again apologized for the calamari. He seemed genuine and we appreciated the gesture for such a  minor issue. You could tell they really care about the customer experience. So despite not being big fans of Limoncello, we politely downed the comp'd drinks!

It wasn't perfect but the food was tasty and the owners seem to care about the quality of their resto. I'll give them another chance."}
{"text":"Positano is my neighbourhood restaurant on Mt Pleasant in Davisville Village. The food is ALWAYS consistently good with service to match. Wonderful specials, which don't change much.  However, there is also a large Pasta and Pizza menu & great starters as well. Never, ever, have we had a bad meal here. Always excellent, perfectly prepared food.  This over 20 years is a amazing accomplishment. Price range is 80-$100 including a glass of wine each for two people."}
{"text":"Very reliable, high quality fare.  Excellent service and lovely atmosphere.  
Wine list isn't extensive but very broad selection 
A great neighborhood bistro"}
{"text":"Great food, service and value.  Yelp did not disappoint with this recommendation.

- Pizzas and pastas from $12 to $18 and daily meat and fish specials in the $20 - $30 range.  Check out their menu online.
- We came on a Thursday night as 6:30 and unsurprisingly the clientele was older folks and families... next time I'd try it a bit later. 
- One thing that's great is that many (perhaps not all of) the tables are well spaced and you don't feel like you are on top of each other.

- I am in this area on occasion for dinner and would not get tired of  coming here frequently.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite local eatery. I love the seafood linguine and fried calamari.
Nice at atmosphere that is casual, I highly advise a reservation especially on Friday to Sunday as it could get very busy."}
