{"text":"Great food! The pizza is amazing but their entrees are even better. The stuffed shells are incredible and i would highly recommend the veal cutlet.  The staff is really nice, the restaurant is nicely designed and just the right size for comfort. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to this spot four times so far and they've always hit the mark. Great Italian food for a decent price. They're never too busy to get a table when I need it and their service is attentive and helpful.  They make great pizza with a nice crispy crust. Their tomato sauce is simply fantastic. They also make the best calzone in Toronto. Unfortunately, I don't think it's a regular menu item, but if you ask I'm sure they'll see if they can swing it for you.  I hate giving out 5 stars to restaurants in case I find a better place, but I think it'll be a while before that happens."}
