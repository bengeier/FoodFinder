{"text":"I been going to focaccia for a year and let me tell you that their customer service had really gone downhill. Every time I go they give me an attitude when I request to get grilled burrito and not only do they give me an attitude they have refused my order by simply saying they don't have time. What kind a customer service is that? How do you operate a business and simply deny doing an order because of time. If you can't take care of your clients how do you expect to grow as a business? I wouldn't recommend any one to go there. Their prices are pricy as it is and their customer service is not at the same level."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here twice and have really enjoyed the food. My first visit I got the rimpolla sandwich and it was tasty (and enough to bring half home for later). Yesterday I had the penne alla vodka and it was good. Nice and spicy which I wasn't quite expecting. But me likee. I also tasted the rigatoni alla fiorentina and it was light and creamy. The fiance added a meatball and it was yummy.   I'll be back but I wish they served wine. What... it's a lunch only spot? ....Oh. Well... I'd still like some wine. It' not like it's illegal to have wine with lunch! :p"}
{"text":"I love going to this place whenever I'm craving penne alla vodka it is probably one of the best pasta's I've ever had. I also love the focaccia bread that they use for all of their sandwiches. I haven't had a chance to check out their breakfast, but from what i read on the menu it seems like a pretty good deal.   It is a little bit expensive, but it will fill you up."}
{"text":"Solid 3 star joint.  No complaints about the food - it is tasty but not impressive.  The meatball sandwich is just massive, pasta creamy and filling.  All Served cafeteria style  I really only have two issues with this place: 1.  They close on the early side at 2pm and always seem to be out of something either pizza, bread, meatballs, pasta, etc.  2. Seems to be a dollar or two pricier than a number of other available options for lunch in the area (ie. 9 or 10 dollars versus 6, 7 , 8 at other places).  I'd come here more often but usually choose to save a couple bucks instead.  Need to try their breakfast still."}
{"text":"$11 for a \"1/2 sandwich\" (which was more like a while sandwich) & side pasta or salad.  Wide variety of both & quality was excellent.  Highly recommend for a local, non-chain lunch experience."}
{"text":"2 for $5 classic breakfast burrito with bacon, cannot beat that and they're so damn good. Great way to start off your morning. I've heard their lunch isn't half bad I'll have to check it out one of these days."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of good food here: breakfast burritos, sandwiches, salads, pasta. Never had a bad meal and everything is reasonably priced, especially for downtown. I recommend a half sandwich with side (pasta or salad). The half sandwich is really the size of a whole, plus you get variety with the pasta or salad. Best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Looking for good pizza downtown?  Good luck.  I got excited when I noticed Focaccia sold pizza. Went in, menu shows prices for whole pizzas, no slices. 1-item, $8.  I asked if they had slices.  No, but they do sell 1/2 pizzas.  Ok, I'll take it.  $8.47.  Right.  .47 cents to cut it in half.  Comes with a salad, if it makes you feel any better.  By the way, most frozen pizza is better.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the best...I MEAN the BEST \"penne alla vodka\" I have ever tasted!!!  I even had to wake up and sneek a few bits in the middle of the night.  The owners take great pride in there food.  We also had the pizza and a sandwhich followed by wonderful desserts.  We had to bring half home only to enjoy again that night for dinner.  If you are ever in this area, this is MUST place to eat.  I am getting hungry writing this!!! We look forward to bringing our friends and family in the future.   Lorin & Carrie"}
{"text":"Sadly, a bad review from me.  I bought an overpriced ($9.21) \"Caprese\" sandwich which, in a word, was disgusting: Soggy focaccia bread, nearly an inch thick of mushy mozzarella, and only a thin slice of tomato with one or two leaves of basil.  I couldn't eat more than a few bites without gagging.  Thank goodness I was on an expense account because this was an utter waste of money.  I would have had the Caprese salad, however when I picked up the container before buying, I noticed that the salad was already swimming in far too much dressing.  Really?  This is NOT the kind of food a weary traveler is looking for en route.  Ugh."}
{"text":"There 2 burritos or wraps or whatever for 5 bucks is a really great deal, I almost always get it when I don't have breakfast with me. It's ham, egg, cheese and mushroom but I take it without the ham and one for the day I order and I eat the second the next morning leaving it at the fridge in the office...it's still really tasty."}
{"text":"Really solid Italian food here... Good lunch pastas and salads.  Can't comment on the pizzas as I didn't try those.  Nothing gourmet, but quite good.  I also hear they make a mean breakfast burrito- odd for an Italian place, but might have to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Here is an example of how NOT to treat your customers.  __________________________________________  Me: Hello can I order a classic burrito w/bacon?   Front counter lady w/the glasses: Sure. That will be $4.06.                *My friend jumps in* I want the same thing.  Me: OK, can we do the 2-for-$5.00 deal?   Front counter lady: No, that's only if we make them at the same time.                  *My burrito wasn't even made yet though.*  Me: Are you serious?   Front counter lady w/the glasses: Sorry. That's $4.06 each.  ______________________________________________                 Wow. Blatantly rude."}
{"text":"The owners of this place are incredibly rude. I have been treated badly on a few occasions here but have always let it go because I enjoy their burritos. This time our order was completely messed up. I called to see what we could do.. The owner stated to bring it back so they could \"look\"  at it. I explained the issue is not what it looks like but what they forgot. If you order a green chile plate and they don't give you the green Chile...that's a problem. I explained I am at work and cannot leave again to walk another 3 blocks to take it back. Is there someone that can bring it since it was their mistake. He said that's not his problem and there's nothing else he can do for me. I understand mistakes happen and I was not angry when I called. After speaking to him and being treated so badly. I decided to take the food back, get a refund and never return. This place is overpriced and the bad service, time and time again was the last straw.  I would think the OWNER would care about his business and lively hood a little more. Not to mention everytime I go, I order the same thing but the price is always different. I don't know what's going on there but be careful with this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I were downtown with some friends, and decided to check this place out. I ordered a pasta lunch, and chose Penne Alla Campagna and another penne with tomatoes and Mozzarella. Meh, it was just okay. The food was just okay, kind of bland and a bit overpriced. I did snag a small slice of pepperoni pizza from one of the kids at our table that was actually the best part of my meal. Would I go back, nope no sir"}
{"text":"We were really hoping this would be a great place.  It may be, but unfortunately, they forgot our order and we sat in a mostly empty restaurant for about 45 minutes wondering what happened to our sandwiches.  Ended up leaving hungry because we couldn't stay any longer.  They did credit us back for the entire meal, so that was good.  Maybe we'll try again??"}
{"text":"Love this place! my usual go to item is the pasta with vodkas sauce? i think thats what it is called! very nice employees! and i also like the pizza they serve. All pre made items."}
{"text":"Had a 3 star rating previously but one of the owners reached out and made an effort to fix the substitution issue. Its nice to know they care what their customers are saying.   Welp, I guess I'm going back to my original rating, once again we rec'd the \"no substitutions\" nothing is the same when the owner isnt there. Dont get bacon, substitute refried beans and paying over 1.00 more. Maybe I dont understand the logic but i would think meat would be pricier than beans.... maybe i should of asked for all the meat on the side if they are going to charge me for it anyways... lol"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go- to spots in downtown. I WISH THEY WERE OPEN AT NIGHT!!! Please note, they are only open M-F for the lunch crowd.   The pastas are AMAZING, I especially like the vinegar pasta! I am actually having them cater my wedding this year."}
{"text":"I went here with some coworkers for lunch yesterday, and wasn't overly impressed. I ordered some chicken dish that was basically a chicken breast (yep, just one...) with cheese, tomato sauce and some asparagus on top...can't remember what it's called (I think it was a special or something). I ordered it in the first place because the asparagus looked yummy...and it was. But...the chicken wasn't anything to write home about and it was too cheesy for my taste. The dish came with either a side of salad or pasta...I tried to go the healthy route with a salad, but regretted my decision immediately. The salad was tiny, and looked really lame...and it was. I think I should have gotten the penne alla vodka or something...next time, I won't make the same mistake (and I assume I'll be back, because my coworkers like this place).   I'm willing to admit that it could have been what I ordered...had I ordered something besides one little chicken breast and an anemic salad, I may feel differently about this place. And if, in the future, my opinion changes, then I'll ammend my review...but for now, 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Even by airport standards this place is a huge rip off. I paid $6.25 for some hummus and what did I get? Two small 1 ounce containers and 2 pieces of ciabatta cut into 4s. I get more ketchup with a small order of fries then this place gave me hummus. The fact that it was horrible tasting hummus didn't make me feel better. Avoid at all costs and get a better deal at NYPD right next door."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite lunchtime spots in downtown. Not exactly an inexpensive lunch, yet reasonable for the quality of the food.   The Focaccia bread for the sandwiches has a great crust and is soft and chewy inside and the ingredients are fresh. My favorite sandwiches are the Rimpolla (#9) and the Classico (#1). The fresh basil, sweet tomato, creamy mozzarella, and salty prosciutto on the #1 is a delicious combination. And the sun dried tomatoes, shaved red onion, and turkey on the #9 are fabulous.   As far as pastas go, they have a few to choose from. The vodka pasta is my favorite. The light tomato cream sauce with a kick of spice is spectacular. Focaccia also has pizzas, salads, daily specials and they are even open for breakfast. I haven't tried the breakfast yet, however, I picked up a menu today and was impressed with all of the options. I can't wait to go back.   I love to get a 1/2 sandwich and small pasta combo. In addition to the quality of the food described above, I like this combo because it is the perfect size workday lunch. While at first, the portions on this combo meal may appear small when you see everyone else getting a huge bowl of pasta, the proof is at the end of the meal.   Everyone else is unbuttoning to top button of their pants and in severe need of a nap from the amount of food they consumed, while my pants are just fine and I am perfectly alert and ready to return to work to finish my day with the lingering thoughts of my luscious lunch.  One more thing about the combo, save a piece of the bread from your sandwich to sop of the yummy vodka sauce from the pasta!!"}
{"text":"Awesome customizable breakfast burrito I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito and attempted to visit Baja Fresh 3 doors down, but alas this branch is not open for breakfast. Lucky for us it was not! We walked down the block looking for something to fill our bellies and this place called me in! The ladies behind the counter are amazingly friendly, helpful, and wonderful at their craft! The burrito options are wide open! Pick what you want in there, and they do it! I got carnitas, beans, cheese, and bacon and included the potatoes inside! So super yummy! And the red spicy sauce was great! ask for 2!  Wish i lived closer so i could try more of the options for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Focaccia Fiorentina, it sounds like a string of italian curse words but it tastes like a gift from the heavens...  I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased a $2 coupon from that online place (wink wink) that let us buy $35 worth of food for only $10. Needless to say, after all the restrictions of the coupon (minimum 2 people, dine-in only), we had enough food for an italian army! Still, it only cost $10 and I was hungry!  I got the #3 sandwich which had Genoa Salami, Moz, Tomatoes, on (you guessed it) Focaccia bread (pardon my french, er... italian). She got the #6 which had Turkey, and a bunch of other stuff that I can't remember.  We also ordered the Penne (something) Vodka.  You know you're an alcoholic when all you remember is the vodka part! Oh, and a large greek salad. Finally, we passed our $35 minimum and we sat down with all this food.  People were staring at us all hateful like we stole this food from ethiopians or something! Geez! I didn't know there was a law against ordering this much food. We weren't going to eat it all there, I promise! We got boxes! Yes, Plural!  The food was great, the lady that greeted us, not so much. We must have interrupted her break, because she was giving me the stink eye. Yes, can I order the #3? Ugh! Did you see that?!?!  Why is it that Italians have the best of everything? The tastiest sandwiches, the tastiest pasta, the tastiest bread, the tastiest men... ahem, sorry. got carried away.  But its true! Everything about italy is awesome. Pizza! Anyway, this place has pizzas too. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Prior to me coming here, I would pass this place and scoff at their sidewalk board sign that claimed they served the \"best breakfast burrito in downtown Phoenix\". I mean seriously, it's an italian restaurant, so, why would they serve breakfast burritos?! Ok, I admit it, I was wrong and Focaccia Fiorentina's right they do serve the best breakfast burritos downtown. Get yourself the Twin Classic which are two burritos for $5. You get a choice of ham or bacon. The burrito isn't large but one burrito is satisfying enough but eating two wouldn't make you look greedy rather you'd be quite full, and could skip lunch. I usually get the Twin Classic with egg whites (no extra charge), I add spinach (dollar extra), no potatoes, and I get it with ham. The bacon is okay but the ham is yummy. Don't get there 15 minutes before 10:30 since they close up breakfast despite their sign saying they serve breakfast until 10:30 (it's a fib), anytime before that is fine and depending on the day expect a line because they're that good. Oh and avoid the coffee, One Coffee is across the street and worth it moreso than their pedestrian coffee that's no better than what's made in an office break room. Oh and the green salsa is worth it!"}
{"text":"Got the twin breakfast burrito and it was good! Little wait time at 10am and the staff was great. Cold water plus a good salsa! I would have like to try a different meat and not have to get an exact twin burro but I guess it's policy..."}
{"text":"My cousin rented this place out the day before yesterday for a dinner after her wedding rehearsal. It was magnificent.   I spoke with the owner and she was very nice. The service was EXCELLENT. The food was very good and everyone had a great time. I tried many of their pizzas and their salad. The pizzas were being cooked fresh and nobody left hungry. The bride and groom were very pleased with presentation, service and a good time was had by all.  I would like to say that parking downtown is difficult during sports events, so plan on parking in a paid lot or VERY far away during a game.  I would highly recommend this place for any occasion.   A special thanks to the owners for making this dinner so special for my family."}
{"text":"Awesome counter-service Italian sandwich, calzone, pasta, and pizza place open only for lunch during the week. New York transplant with great ingredients and recipes.  They have a huge menu of the aforementioned menu items that cater to vegetarian and meat eaters. The prices are very reasonable (around $7) when considering the quality of food, the ingredients, and the ambitious serving sizes. Calzones and pizzas are monstrous and the foccacia sandwiches aren't a slouch either. Sandwiches aren't as good as Cibo, but are a very good alternative for the price and a quicker meal.  However, the huge menu is also it's downfall. While exploring it I have found several pretty bland menu items that don't belong. Some of the turkey and vegetarian sandwiches I have tried have been sub-par. People I've been with have also had some mediocre experiences with their pastas o' the day.  I also visit it far less then I normally would because they won't serve you free water. You have to buy a bottle. Isn't that illegal?"}
{"text":"Good, average food at your typical downtown lunch joint."}
{"text":"I love this place. I wish they had dinner hours. It's a little loud. But other than that, it's by far my favorite place to eat lunch in the heart of downtown. It's so consistently good. I believe it's family-owned and as such nothing has changed in years, which is a wonderful thing. I highly recommend the Vodka and the Fiorentina and the mushroom-sauced daily special when they have it. And the manicotti. And the calzone. Oh, you dirty little calzone... It is what it is and what it is is sooooo good."}
{"text":"One would imagine that with a name like Focaccia's they would actually have focaccia for sandwiches.  Nope. It's like Burger King running out of burgers at lunch. Lame huh? Getting a sandwich in a tortilla just doesn't cut it.  I should have stayed hungry and saved my appetite for dinner."}
{"text":"Their breakfast burritos have definitely went down hill in the last few years. They currently are charging more for burritos with egg, yet they have less egg then ever. These burritos were hefty and were generously filled with potatoes, cheese and egg, now 2 burritos equal 1 one of the burritos from the past. Their sign out front says best breakfast burrito in phoenix, thats definitely not true."}
{"text":"Went here w/ a couple of co-workers yesterday and about 2 weeks ago, for lunch. Food is good, their pastas are yummy, sandwiches are good too... prices... eh.. they could be lower. The service is fast, no wait staff to deal with or tip. The prices are not less than $7 as someone else mentioned in their review. Be prepared to spend $10-13 for your lunch. Good thing I pack the 4 of the 5 work days!"}
{"text":"I made a large order ahead of time and when I came to pick it up I was happy to see that they had everything ready and well organized. They were very nice and helped us out to the car. The restaurant itself is nice and clean, also nice decor. I had a calzone which was good. My only complaint about my food would be that the sauce that came with the calzone was a bit watery, I would have liked it to be a thicker, richer tomato sauce. Also, I think the contact information on their website might need to be updated? I had trouble getting through via fax and phone. Overall, happy with my experience!"}
{"text":"got to try this place twice; once for breakfast and once for lunch. the food was good..but not sure if it was worth the price.  breakfast - this was actually pretty cheap. ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito and a fruit cup. the burrito was good, a bit too salty though.  the fruit was surprisingly, really fresh!  lunch- i spent like $20 one 1 sandwich, a side salad, and a tiny side of pasta. did not think it was really worth it. plus, if you're hitting the lunch rush, be prepared to wait. didnt think i'd have to wait 15 minutes for a sandwich, side salad and pasta. mind you, the salad and pasta were already pre-made."}
{"text":"This place was very busy so be prepared or do carryout ;) I had to try the Vodka and Fiorentina after Dallas G.'s review =) It was super yummy just like he said and I'd eat here often if I was a down towner! I am such a sucker for Italian!! Loved it thanks for sharing it Dallas!!!"}
{"text":"Meh:  Go there because work is near by.  I think the food is over priced but dependable.  The pastas are the best best or the sandwich by itself.  Don't make the mistake of ordering a side of pasta which will net you a smallish cup (amounting to two forkfulls of pasta) for like four bucks.  Okay for a quick work bite."}
{"text":"I had an appointment downtown and stopped in at this little eatery for their daily lunch special.  Their pasta was delicious and their focaccia bread was dense and full of Rosemary flavor.  All in all it was a nice and fast lunch option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This review is for the food available at the Phoenix Airport.  I had the Classico.  It was served on rosemary focaccia bread with olive oil, fresh basil, tomatoes, mozzerella and nice quality spicy proscuitto.  It was a very tasty sandwich.  Not soggy at all, which many pre wrapped sandwiches tend to do.  The Chicken Milano salad with corn, hearts of palm, bell peppers, shredded carrots, grilled chicken looked fresh and tasty.  I could not believe I was seeing airport food.  I highly recommend.  If I am in town I would for sure go to their main location."}
{"text":"This place is very good  and I do agree they have best burrito in town! This place is very quick to get you in and out! The staff there is the friendliest and warming and welcoming I will definitely be back! I found out about this place 5 months ago and been trying to come out often but I am loyal to this place because they have phenomenal service thank you!"}
{"text":"Service has improved quite a bit. This is one of the best breakfast burritos downtown. My suggestion: green chili beef with potatoes and cheese, if they aren't too busy they can grill the burrito for you."}
{"text":"Went for lunch recently.  It was just ok.  The panini was fairly unremarkable and the side of penne vodka was kind of bland too, with just a hint of spice.  It wasn't all that cheap, either.  I guess it's ok, but Cafe Roma over in Arizona Center is a better alternative for this kind of quick, casual Italian."}
{"text":"Got the caprese sandwich, worst sandwich I've ever had in my entire life.  Bread was at least 4 days old.  While thing was just disgusting. Worst part, paid over $10 ew."}
{"text":"The food is good.  But i'm always missing something when from my order.  They always remember to charge for a side or something else but fail to include it.  This was the last time Im going here.  This has happened to many times."}
{"text":"Tried this Italian place for last-minute lunch yesterday.  NOTE: Try to avoid around 12pm noon, M-F, due to lunch rush, but this is already common sense...  Had pesto pasta w/their Penne alla Vodka, very good flavors! But, it is sitting in steam pans, so don't expect \"freshly made pasta either\". Their homemade rolls are so tasty - almost seems like there's some rosemary in the bread? Well, whatever it is - I enjoyed.   I'm surprised w/all of the lowered star reviews! The lady who helped me was very friendly and I had no customer service issues at all. Prices are on the higher side, but I just atribute that to being downtown, I guess."}
{"text":"Awesome Vegan Burrito and my friends like the other burritos they make as well. The staff is friendly and helpful and the management is responsive and proactive. Yum."}
{"text":"Focaccia Fiorentina is a great place to eat downtown. It's usually really quick to get through the line, quick cafeteria style serving, and lots of indoor air conditioned seating. Really yummy pasta - which sucks for someone who is gluten free, but really great when you want to cheat! I like the Penne al Vodka, but there's a ton of choices. There's always a special - usually chicken - and they're pretty friendly here as well. You can always get to-go as well.   Just be careful, they serve rolls with every meal. It's a carb fest, but it's yummy and quick working downtown!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I am always hesitant of the \"downtown lunch places\".  It is nice inside and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  The three cheese calzone was absolutely disgusting. No self-respecting restaurant should serve something that bad and be able to sleep at night.    The pasta on other people's table looked good.  I may give them another chance and try that.  But if you are capable of something that awful, it makes you wonder."}
{"text":"This is my new breakfast go to.   They are open and ready at 6am.   I love the staff here bright and cheery at 6am is not easy.   Their  2 for $5 breakfast burritos are killer.  They are different as they are more like an omelette in a tortilla .   My next comment is to be taken with extreme caution!!!!    Their Brownies and cinnamon rolls are addictive.   I can take or leave brownies.   First they are huge and first bite is an explosion of brownie heaven.    If you are in the dog house with your wife;  forget the flowers!  Get her a brownie from this place and its a sure shot winner winner chicken dinner.    Their sandwiches are good also."}
{"text":"Ever since the job moved downtown, I've been excited for lunch.  Sooooo many places to try.  Recently, I've had equal excitement over breakfast. This is mainly due to finding this place.  I've tried the Low Carb Omelete w/chorizo, and their special - turkey, tomato, basil, egg whites and some kind of cheese on focaccia.    I was not expecting to be satisfied whatsoever with the omelet, only getting it cause I was trying to be \"good\".  The thing was awesome.  Hmm, I can't remember EVERYTHING that was on it, but just remember that the chorizo went together really nicely with the fluffy omelet, and whatever else was on it made it a perfect tasting deal.  The fluffiness of it was my favorite part.  Really well made.  Enough to make me declare that at least a twice a week breakfast for me going forward.  My next visit I had that sandwich, which isn't on the menu but found on their board outside.  Now this..this right here....oh man.  Maybe because I never had focaccia before.  Maybe because I'm really easy to please when it comes to sandwiches.  Or maybe because it was just friggin delicious.  The basil and garlic together with whatever cheese on there and those fresh tomatos...that right there is enough to make me love it.  But then the fluffy egg and the thin slices of turkey give it a...solidness.  I dunno, it just all comes together and the flavor is just stupid good.    Now the first time I went in, I saw a big vat of bacon.  Next to that was a big vat of potatoes.  I ordered a side of potatoes with my lo-carb omelet (yeah there went the whole lo-carb thing) and the lady noted my admiration of the bacon and threw in a slice:)  That alone made me wanna come back for the 2nd visit.  Then after tasting the potatoes, it made me know this would be a regular place for breakfast.  Right across from Starbucks so I can call my order in and get coffee while I'm waiting.  Perfect.  Plus the people are friendly here.  I also like that they don't turn on all the lights early in the morning, making it a nice place for someone like me to eat breakfast in - I'm NOT a morning person and don't like bright lights and bright people at 6am.  The prices are fine with me.  I had to give up being cheap ever since the job moved downtown.  If you can get full for under $7, I consider that great.  And here you can.  I think both times I paid about that much.    I see a lot of the bad reviews are for lunch items.  I'll have to see what the deal is on that end of things.  But if you're hungry at 6:30 and like flavorful food, I'd suggest this place.  So far they are pretty darn awesome."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding! A must have. I would recommend it to my family and yours. Come give it a try. Will return over and over again! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I just wish I had used a coupon at this place.  I would probably had rated it at 4 stars, because for a walk up and order spot, this place is pretty pricey.  I had the Classic salad, my wife had the cheesy pasta and both of my boys shared a small pizza.  With a couple of drinks the bill was $35.  The food was pretty tasty, but the pizza and pasta were pretty small.  I felt like we over paid by about $9.  So I would return, but with a coupon."}
{"text":"Forced to eat here on a red eye layover when everything else was closed. Paid $9 for the most disgusting wrap I've ever had. Even with the extreme amount of onion, soggy lettuce, soggy tortilla, old bacon, dry chicken, and no sauce - it stills seems like it should have tasted somewhat better than it did. WOW. Zero stars."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place!  I was downtown for a training class and didn't have a long time for lunch.  Thanks to yelp we found this place and I'm so glad we did.  We were greeted warmly as soon as we entered the restaurant!  Having never been there, we had questions and the person helping us was so patient and knowledgeable.  The food was great!  I had the chicken pesto sandwich and it was delicious!  I'd have it again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"The trick is to go early enough on a winter morning that the restaurant is in twilight -- either it has no artificial lights in the atrium or they don't turn them on for breakfast -- so you can watch the city slowly wake up. Phoenix is remarkably reluctant to face the day -- it's not so much the \"city that never sleeps\" as the city that rolls out of bed at 8:55 and fumbles for the aspirin -- but turns very pleasing shades of pinky-gray while doing so.  It's a good burrito. One special merit, if you're not absolutely committed to the cheapest deal, is that it's possible to get a burrito with no eggs. The scrambled eggs I've had here are perfectly fine, but some days I'm not up for trusting other people to make eggs and on those days, a huge burrito packed with chorizo and potatoes hits the spot.  I've yet to have any problem with service. The ladies behind the counter are firm, but honestly, dealing with me before breakfast requires communicating like a strict kindergarten teacher."}
{"text":"I work downtown, and this place is one of the few places to eat that offer quality food on a tight time frame.  The prices are reasonable, too."}
{"text":"Just had the Ricotta and it was pretty good. The lady who served my meal was extremely friendly but the woman who wrung me up seemed to be annoyed by my presence. Don't think I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Going to lunch here for the last 20 years. Nice quality, family owned eatery. I've enjoyed the pasta, salads, sandwiches and pizza for years.  Always a great place to pick up a quick lunch.  Can't go wrong with the variety of daily offerings of pasta and specials like chicken marasala.     High-quality ingredients are used and the portions are generous but not overwhelmingly large.    Recently I discovered their breakfast burritos  and cinnamon rolls.  Yum!!!   Coffee isn't bad either.  So I'm now here for breakfast as well.    Did I say I really like the people that own this place?   They work hard and it shows."}
{"text":"This is a favorite go-to breakfast place for my whole office! Everything I've had is delicious, priced right, and made to order so quick! Honestly, best breakfast burritos in town and now I've discovered the green chili omelets... omg! I haven't had any issues with service like other people have mentioned. The women working in the mornings are so nice, but sometimes rushed because there's a line to the door. If you time it right though, you can usually beat the breakfast crowd."}
{"text":"Always loved their vodka pasta, however had to stop eating it after starting on a low carb diet : ("}
{"text":"OK... I'm slow. But.. we've been busy. Being in the video production biz, our crews work hard and can get picky at times like wild animals if their food isn't good. They put in long hours, go the extra mile and so they expect the same when the lunch wagon rolls up. No sissy, wishy washy soggy pizzas or sandwiches with week old bread and green meat, no watered down drinks or limp lifeless fries. They want real MAN FOOD, and lots of it.   THIS is what we got from Margaret and her team at Focaccia Fiorentina. We were broadcasting from the Orpheum and needed someone close and good. We ordered a couple days ahead of time to ensure all was set, and BINGO... right on time their delivery service showed up and things were as they should be.   Ever had an order get messed up? Didn't happen here. Ever had your pizza show up cold and dumpster ready? Not here. Everything was hot and ready to go and the guys loved it and Margaret's suggestions were right on target. AND.. the price was affordable for eating on location.  Thanks to everyone there @ FF, and if you find yourself working, visiting, hiking, roaming, or just lost in downtown Phx, stop by for directions and a meal. They've got you covered. We'll be back soon when we're in the area making pretty pictures."}
{"text":"I'm working downtown now (new themed list to come soon!) so I'm exploring the area from a different angle. I'm no stranger to downtown/midtown's happy hour and dinner spots, but I've never had to go out and search for breakfast or lunch during the day.   I checked out Focaccia one morning when I hadn't had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband, Myles M, who works right around the corner. He said I should order the breakfast burrito, so I did, because he's pushy and I always do what I'm told. Ok, neither of things are true, but in this case, he had conviction and I obediently complied.   The breakfast burrito was worth every penny. Being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism, I got it with egg whites (cool that they had that option), spinach, green salsa and potatoes. The woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious. The potatoes were skin-on which gave them a great texture and flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick.   The hot coffee from the carafe I got to accompany it was airplane-quality, but next time, I'll just grab something from Cartel on the way back to my office. God knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to Focaccia."}
{"text":"Normally I get the chorizo burrito and they are really good. Figure I would try something else this morning and that was a mistake. Don't get the bacon burrito. They only put 1 slice of bacon on there felt cheated."}
{"text":"I work in downtown central Phoenix and I've been going to Focaccia every morning for their french toast. It is delicious, and apparently addictive. Beware! The french toast comes with bacon or ham and a couple pieces of fruit for $5.25, which I consider a fair deal. I've also had their pizzas and they're very good as well."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for over 3 years and I loved their food but today Friday 2/20/2014 will be the last! The owner is incredibly rude and doesn't care about his customers. So here is what happened... I ordered the green chili plate that comes with beans, tortilla egg and green chili beef. When I got my order and went back to my office they had only given me an egg and some beans. Mistakes happen and I am very understanding of that but this guy just didn't care if they messed up,  I guess because he didn't think I would go back. So when I called back all he could say was to \"bring it back.\"  I told him I can't leave my office again and he said \"then bring it back on Monday.\" I asked can you have someone bring me what you guys forgot. He said \"no I don't deliver.\" So I said fine and hung up.  When I returned the food he wasn't as confident as he was on the phone but did try to give me back less than my total. I got the full amount once I said something.  I would have still gone back and enjoyed their food even if they messed up this order by again mistakes happen, but that jerk owner just lost 10 regular customer, everyone in the office will hear about this."}
{"text":"Worst burrito I have ever had. So soggy I could not even pick it up. The owner was reluctant to let me order something different when I brought it to their attention. Then I asked for a glass of water and they also refused and demanded I purchase a bottle of water! This establishment was so rude to me I will never return. No reason to waste money here when there are so many great choices nearby!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot right in downtown. They do serve breakfast now as well, and i hear it is really good too.   A lot of seating, few tv's and large windows to downtown people watch as well. Quick service and a nice variety in their menu too. You got pizza, calzones, salads, pasta and of course focaccia sandwiches. You can also do 1/2 orders with your sandwich and get a side of a pasta the normal order comes with your choice of chips and drink.I tried the Caprese sandwich and it was pretty good, i loved the fresh ingredients ( reason for the 4th star). My sandwich was just over $10, but the fresh ingredients again were worth it. My peeps that accompanied me enjoyed their pasta as well with no complaints.   Chill, relax environment which on your lunch hour is just what you need sometimes."}
{"text":"It took Chris T.'s ROTD to remind me that I have eaten here more than once. Working just down the street, when I forget to bring my lunch I wander the streets for a bit wondering where to go or fall back to Baja as my trusty standby.  Now on at least 2 occasions I have chosen Focaccia Fiorentina.  On one visit I had one of their cream based pastas with penne.  This was quite tasty and the portion was more than enough for lunch.  The second time I found myself here, I ordered up their half pizza special with a drink for @ $6.  Now it sounds larger than it is.  My coworkers usually find they like a full pizza plus a salad for a lunch meal. Having the choice between the pepperoni or the pizza of the day, buffalo chicken, I chose the buffalo chicken.   (Not recommended for those prone to heartburn).    The food is good, not stellar as is the service.  It is a worthy lunch time downtown stop."}
{"text":"The pasta was good, the staff was overly friendly but it took a while to get my food since everything is made fresh. I had a sandwich with eggplant, mozz, and tomatoes and the rigatoni special. If you are in a hurry just order the pasta from the window and you should be fine but I didn't. Fairly high priced which is my main reason to rate it 3 stars and the wait time."}
{"text":"Awesome chorizo omelet at a fair price and very fast service. Nice selection of teas and a cute little place, I would go back for sure. They could be a bit more modern on some things and some better lighting and light music would be cool but it's a solid place"}
{"text":"Survived my second morning of class and chose this place for lunch.   At 11:30 we were the only group dining in and we got all six of our sandwiches in less than 10 minutes.  I had the Fattoria sandwich and it was delicious, but a half sandwich would have been more than adequate.  If I worked in downtown Phoenix this place would definitely be a part of my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I really, really did but really, really didn't love it. I didn't even like it that much. We took some friends there for lunch today and by the looks of the food, it seemed so promising. It is a casual spot where the food it pretty much pre-prepared and being heated in the windows at the counter. This restaurant has pizza, salads, pasta, sandwiches, and baked goods. I ordered one of the specials, chicken parmesan with a side of penne alla vodka. The chicken was so bland that I felt like I was eating boiled chicken. As my husband put it, it tasted like diet food but without the benefits of diet food because of the breading. The pasta was also weirdly bland and spicy. The spicy part really surprised me because I have never had it spicy. My husband had the penne alla campagna (1/2) and another (1/2) penne dish that we can't remember. His were slightly better than mine but not by much. It is sad that the best part of the meal was the pepperoni pizza we bought for kids. Would I go there again? Probably not. For 4 adults and 2 kids, we spent $65 which I find disappointing for an extremely mediocre meal. I suppose for people that work close by (it is downtown at Central and Adams), it is a nice convenience but if I wanted Italian food, I'd probably choose Pasta Bar."}
{"text":"Soild, simple Italian lunch spot. The Classico sandwich is worth a shot, simple prosciutto, basil and mozzarella."}
{"text":"For the past month, I've been trying to come to FF for their fabulous breakfast burritos as often as possible. I was informed earlier in February of their permanent closure. The news hit me hard. For the past couple years, dropping in here during the mornings helped to get me through the day. The two burrito specials (second burrito for $5) either made for a filling breakfast or a nice snack later in the day. Heck, FF even catered a birthday month for the company for which I work.  And this morning, on your last day open, a turnout of support: line from counter to door! You went out on top, FF. I loved you and I will miss you dearly. Thanks for all the great food memories."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I came here for lunch since it is closed to work. I was highly disappointed at their food and its services. When I first arrived, I told the server multiple times that I am new and have never been there. She didn't seem to care a bit or bother introducing their menus to me. The only thing she asked was if we were ready to order or not. Finally, I've decided to order from their lunch menu \"Side by side Pasta\" ($8). I picked a meat ball with Penne with a small side of drinks. Total came to $13....which is pricy even in downtown area. If the dish is $8...does it mean the small drink is $3????   The meatball is tasteless and the Penne is cold. I'm not joking you....my entire dish isn't even warm. I couldn't even finish half of it and ended up throwing the whole thing away. Needless to say, my stomach started hurting few hours later (and I didn't eat anything else all morning). The only reason I give it 2 star is because I do like their ice tea and the restaurant is pretty clean.   I will certainly definitely never going to come back here again."}
