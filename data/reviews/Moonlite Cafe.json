{"text":"Great food, great beer, and friendly bartenders in a casual, laid-back atmosphere. TVs are front and center so this is a great place to watch the game. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been in Brookline for a year and consider this to be one of the jewels of the neighborhood.
I visited in May 2014 for dinner with a friend.  He had veal parm.  It came stand alone and the pasta on the side at cost.  I had the old tried and true spaghetti and meatballs.

The veal was excellent.  Breaded ever so lightly, fried gently. Very flavorful.  The meatballs, delicious.  The spaghetti sauce, sweet and incredibly flavorful.  We both had the wedding soup, and my only regret was that I didn't order a bowl.  Broth, escarole, carrot, meat....a classic done superbly well.

We each had an alcohol drink, one wine, one beer.
Bill came to about $15 for the both.  

Great food and at an affordable price.  Ill be back.  

The dining room is behind the bar.  Food can be eaten in the bar, but not my scene.  The doing room is basically 10 tables around 2 pool tables.  No atmosphere but in classic Italian tradition its a no frills room to eat a meal filled with goodness.

Four stars -- food is great, service wonderful, prices are excellent. Dining room with two pool tables, yuk."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some lunch before my husband got his tattoo reworked a few doors down the street. We decided to go with the prosciutto and arugula pizza based on a former review and we were NOT disappointed. The place truly seems like it might be a dive but it's not. It's super clean, well cared for, and the food was delicious. We aren't in that area very often, but I would definitely go back the next time I was. Their week-round drink specials seemed great!"}
{"text":"Ive gone to the moonlite for years. The food is great and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"This combination bar and Italian restaurant is a wonderful gem within the Pittsburgh food scene. The food options include a decent variety of Italian entrees and a delicious array of appetizers. Of course, the two best parts of the Moonlite Cafe experience are the authenticity and the taste. Everything appears (and most likely is) homemade and made with traditional Italian love and care. You will not get this quality and taste at any ordinary restaurant. My personal recommendations are the calzones and the raviolis (when they are the special). The environment is welcoming, the service is great, and the food is wonderful. I recommend checking Moonlite out, and possibly becoming a regular."}
{"text":"One of Brooklines best kept secrets! Recently started coming here after living in the neighborhood for a few years and we were not dissapointed. They have delicious salad options for me and my husband is full on addicted to the open faced hot italian sandwich. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Owner and staff very friendly, excellent wings, had honey barbecue and garlic parmesan, crispy, but tender, sauces flavorful, ordered arugula and prosciutto specialty pizza which was also superb, beer was very cold and fresh.  Ambience is a neighborhood bar, pool tables in the middle of the dining area, tables comfortable, access to restaurant from parking area in the back a little challenging, dark at night, food is top notch."}
{"text":"Really great local bar and restaurant. Looks a little bit \"divey\" from the outside, but inside is always clean and staff is welcoming. The food is homemade and everything I've had has been excellent. Some of my favorites are the wings, pizzas, and meatball hoagie. Their pasta specials are also really good and served in hearty portions! My boyfriend and I love going after 8:00 for their evening bar menu, when a number of items (including my beloved meatball hoagie) are only $5, and they have some nice pizza/wings + beer specials. Large bar, great food, friendly service, pool tables, darts, juke box... what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great food everytime love the moonlite chicken sandwich... The sampler platter is amazing you get so much food for such a great price !"}
{"text":"Very good food and very nice service.   I had the chic Marsala and it was excellent.   Casual bar/restaurant but very good.  Low prices too."}
{"text":"We love this bar. It's a laid back, neighborhood bar in Brookline. They have terrific food but we really enjoy the wings which are $.50 Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. The owner is really friendly and there often. We love to go for a relaxed evening and play pool or darts, watch the game, and grab a few beers. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I am shocked by the recent favorable reviews of this place. The food is frozen and not satisfying in the least. Parmigiana, no matter the contents, should be freshly breaded and a light fry. Not coated in a heavy batter. Same goes for the provolone wheel. It had visible freezer burn and was brought to the table within 5 minutes of being ordered. Obviously not prepared at order. The bread was not fresh either. I'm genuinely disappointed with the recent changes. 

We would have left once seeing the very very limited menu if our server wasn't sweet and we had enough cash to cover our drinks and a tip for her. We stuck it out and left with no intention to return."}
{"text":"We are slowly making our way down Brookline Boulevard trying all the great restaurants. Moonlight Cafe was next on our list as many locals recommended it to us. A huge plus is that it is non smoking! It was mostly filled with regulars during Friday happy hour. The very friendly bartender was also playing hostess and waitress but greeted us quickly. They had $4 import drafts and bottles on special. I got an Angry Orchard and my date, Dan,  got a Blue Moon draft- they had a nice beer selection. The menu was rather limited with a few appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches and pasta options. I went with a house salad and bowl of wedding soup. The wedding soup was very good with homemade meatballs but it was served in a very tiny cup but still the pricing of a bowl. My salad was fresh and came with tomatoes, olives, chick peas and peppers. Dan ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwhich served with homemade chips. The sandwich was huge and the chips had a sweet BBQ flavor. Our dinner was $25 so very reasonable prices. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is in the high mediocre range and the food is over priced, minus wing night, but the food is overall good. However the crowd here is quality. And they got pool tables and darts. Defiantly the best bar in Brookline."}
{"text":"I love the Moonlite! I'm from Latrobe, PA, and it consistently reminds me of just average, mom & pop family restaurants. The food is good, the prices are great, and the atmosphere is pleasant. Also, the portions are huge!

The bar is also the only smoke-free bar in Brookline and I think it's great!

Thursday's is $4 wine nights, so I recommend a visit those days if you enjoy a glass of vino. Also, the Moonlite Chicken sandwich is pretty ballin!"}
{"text":"My husband I just moved to the Brookline area and we have been asking around to everyone we meet about places we should try. At the top of every local's list is Moonlite Cafe. 

We popped in for an early dinner and some beer one night and we soon returned, and have since been back twice in a short amount of time. The part that drew us in - it is a neighborhood bar that does not allow smoking indoors! The part that kept us coming back - the food!

The bartenders are all very nice and the service in general is fantastic. The owner has been there every night we go and he helps out, which is nice to see! 

We LOVE the food. The menu isn't huge. This is a casual neighborhood bar that serves delicious italian food. They have sandwiches, salads, wings, mozzarella sticks, other appetizers and a few entrees. The chicken parm is my favorite dish I've tried so far. My husband is obsessed with the lemon chicken. We have also tried their wings, which were great! The entrees come with bread (from Brookline's Deluca's if I'm not mistaken) and a salad. The prices are very reasonable.

We have also really enjoyed coming here to watch sports. We've been going to Moonlite a lot lately to watch the Penguins in the playoffs and that's been pretty fun! It's easy to get a table or a seat at the bar to watch the game and enjoy some drinks and food. 

Oh and there are two billiards / pool tables in the big back room if you're into that!

For parking there are parking spots all up and down Brookline Blvd. The spots on one side of the street are pull-in/pull-out spots and the other side of the street are parallel spots. You can pay at the station or with the app."}
{"text":"Love going on Thursdays for Chicken parm and seeing Dana the mayor of Brookline , always friendly and great service !!"}
{"text":"We live down the street and have been meaning to come here... Now that we have, we will be here ALL THE TIME! I hate croutons, I pick them off, but their home made croutons on the house salad were amazing! The hot garlic parm wings had me licking my fingers, the stuffed peppers had the best sausage in them, and the waitress was so sweet and accomodating... I couldn't be happier! The place isn't well advertised, so I feel it's necessary to say... Please come here, for your sake and to ensure this place stays open for the rest of my life. Thank you."}
{"text":"Was our favorite restaurant, but they killed it when they closed the full service restaurant and just put tables in the bar. The menu is smaller, the food is different than it was and nowhere as good. Hardly ever go there anymore, and when we do, we're usually disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing local cafe serving best ever traditional cafe foods! Good services and enjoyable atmosphere. I had crab cake, veal chu chu sandwich and wedding soup. The sandwich is among the best I had in Pittsburgh and worth a try. The soup was tasty, too. I wasn't a fan of their crab cake, but guess I shouldn't order it at the first place considering the price (come on, what kind of crab cake do I expect to get with a few bucks only?!)"}
{"text":"I was in need of something greasy, something to satisfy my pit in my stomach and when Moonlite Cafe was suggested, I said why not?

Walking in you are greeted by the neighborhood sports bar vibe.  Especially since I came here during the Pirates game.  The bar was lined by what looks liked regulars and Pirates fanatics.  Some high top tables lined the perimeter of the room making for getting a seat a bit of a task, but once seated we were fine.  At the time we were there, we basically did it all ourselves.  We had to go to the bar to ask for menus and back to the bar to order.  The food was delivered to the table, but by the looks of it, and with how busy it was here, they only had the bartender working at that point.  That's not to detract from the fact that we received amazing service and that bartender was one bad ass.  She gave it right back to the regulars and kept it moving.

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and he got a meatball hoagie.  I wasn't expecting much from a bar burger but I ended up surprised.  The patty was thick and juicy, cooked to your liking.  Topped with cheese and expertly cooked bacon.  Lettuce and tomato on the side so you can add if you like, nice move as to not water down the bun before diving in.  Condiments are giving to you prior so you can put as much of any condiment you like on your burger.  Each burger/sandwich is served with house potato chips.  They were amazing as well.  I still cannot figure out what the seasoning was that topped these, but they were amazing.  As for the meatball hoagie, it was HUGE.  Three big meatballs covered in marinara and cheese.  Satisfying?  Yes.  Price point is on target as well, did not break the bank.

Specials every night of the week.  Some decent beers on tap."}
{"text":"Best wings and fries in Pittsburgh!!  Really great bar atmosphere!  Food is typical bar food but delicious. They have a pretty good rotating draft selection and the bartenders are great. I love this place, really. It's a great neighborhood bar, I only wish I lived in walking distance!!"}
{"text":"How does this place only have like a half dozen reviews? As a Sicilian, if I want Italian, I cook it. When my realtor insisted I try this place, I thought, \"well I am hungry, and the fridge is empty...\" and so off went the boyfriend and I. 

Louie, the owner, was there. He spied us immediately and wanted to know our story. Apparently this is a place for regulars. We fit right in. This guy is THE MAN. He was so nice, and so welcoming, as was his large and loud Italian family that were dining there that night. Hey, these are my people. We love to eat, we love to talk, and we love our wine and dessert. Moonlite has it all; atmosphere, food, family, and a full bar. The employees are good people. The bartenders know their stuff. I suspect close to everything is homemade down to the croutons in the salad (and if not it tastes the part) and the desserts are too (not there, they order them locally, which is also awesome!)

I would never have found this place. It looks like nothing special from the outside, and nothing too fancy on the inside either, but who cares? It's delicious, and I love coming here. I have probably tried everything on the menu at this point and that's not an exaggeration. Everything is good, simple, and perfectly done. It's exactly what Italian should be. AUTHENTIC with HUGE portions. Suck it Olive Garden, I never liked you anyway. 

Seriously, check this place out.. It's a gem. Simplicity is key in good Italian cooking and they nail it. The veal is perfect every time, the zucchini mountain is spot on, and all the pasta dishes are great. Try the Sicilian dinners too; if you know the difference between Sicilian and Italian, you will definitely appreciate them."}
{"text":"My date and I ate dinner there last night. We were really craving good Italian food and Moonlite didn't disappoint. I ordered the chicken parmigiana and he ordered the chicken marsala and both were very tasty. My house salad was delicious as well. Lots of veggies, croutons and olives. Only thing about my dish was that I could tell they used frozen breaded chicken and didn't make it fresh. It still tasted great but this is not an authentic Italian restaurant. However for the price I still highly recommend. 

I was looking forward to some fresh bread to go with my side of pasta but unfortunately it was cold and stale. If I'd change one thing about this place it would be to step it up with the bread - that would make a world of difference."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. I've visited for drinks and pool a few times in the past, but dined there for the first time this weekend. I expected standard bar food and was super impressed by the homemade quality of everything we ordered.

After 8pm, they have a special low-price menu with $4 appetizers,$5 sandwiches and burgers, and a great wing and pitcher special. We ordered both appetizers to share amongst the group. The provolone wheel was literally a round of provolone breaded, fried, and topped with sauce. Best eaten by just digging in with a fork, it is melty cheesy goodness. The tomato sauce was spot on as well, just sweet enough to cut through the richness of all the cheese. The fried zucchini was the real surprise - amazingly light, crispy breading with a mild seasoning. I've never really liked fried zucchini because it tends to get soggy and limp. I don't know what their secret is, but I would order this fried zucchini every time!

For my meal I enjoyed the burger with american cheese. It was juicy with a nice chargrilled flavor (reminded me of a good quality Burger King patty haha, I mean that as a compliment!) and the toppings were fresh. A solid burger. My hubby quickly devoured the meatball sub so I didn't get a chance to try it, but he was impressed. We both enjoyed the homemade fries that accompanied the sandwiches - spice blend game strong.

The bartender that's usually working is super sweet and makes sure that nobody waits too long for a drink. The owner is an awesome guy as well. Always comes out to say hi to the regulars and introduces himself to anyone that he doesn't recognize. Overall, a really great local bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"At first glance you may think this is a Pittsburgh dive bar that serves some bar snacks.

Wow you would be wrong!! Visited this place last night from high Yelp reviews - so glad I did! First of all, the place is exceptionally clean- something I was very happy to see especially because it is mainly a bar! Even with having a large bar, pool tables, and poker machines, it is clean and inviting. There are many large flat screen tvs in the dining area - I would say 8 or so. All are modern and have a great picture quality. 
The menu is comprised of fried appetizers, sandwiches, pizza, and Italian dinners. I was in a pasta mood so I opted for the spaghetti and meatballs (I added a picture to the restaurant listing)- a deal at 8.99, although a side salad is about $3-4 more- it is worth the money with roasted red peppers, chickpeas, olives, tomatoes, and croutons.
My boyfriend opted for the prosciutto and arugula thin crust pizza (picture has been added to the gallery)- it was a feast for the eyes and the stomach - would highly recommend.
The other star of the night was the spicy garlic parmesan wings. WOW. I first discovered this sauce when I was in college (one of the local pizza shops created a delicious take on it) and have since not been able to find to mimic the wings I loved so much. They knocked this sauce out of the park! If you like spicy, but not too spicy, with a good tang, give them a try. They cooked the wings perfectly with a nice crunch on the outside skin. I can't wait to order them again. 

Don't ignore this local spot! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed Moonlite yet! 

It's a great neighborhood bar with good food and cheap drinks. The price of the food might seem a bit high for the divey feel of the establishment, but it is really pretty good, so the price probably is more in line with the quality. 

That being said, I do still go for the specials, like wing nights! 60¢ wings (I believe) on Sunday-Monday-Tuesday. (Double check that-its been a while!) 8-10pm has some good bar specials on food and drinks. Daily drink specials and a good special most days.

Bar area in front and tables in the back. Its a chill place that I intend to frequent more."}
{"text":"Great local bar with amazing homemade food that is cheap and fresh. Love the \"good ol neighborhood bar\" vibe. The bar isn't big but they do have pool in the back that used to be an additional restaurant part but recently tpok out. Anything with red sauce on their menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit here I was not extremely impressed when I first walked through the door.  We went to the back by the pool tables and wow it opens up nicely.  Our server was nice and prompt I asked her about a menu item and she said she didn't know but wait and I'll ask... Love that... we could hear the chef yelling the answer she came out and told us even though we had already heard the answer.  I ordered the Reuben my wife ordered the beacon cheese burger. The bread was light and perfectly tested.  the sourcrout was very nice and I suspect actual Russian dressing,  the corned beef was hot flavorful and moist it was delicious. Best I have had outside of NY.  So... nice decor good drinks and excellent food.  Chef even came out to chat(slower night) the fire fighters come here so you know it's good.  if you have a chance to stop by do it. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to try a new restaurant on Brookline Blvd only to find it was closed on Mondays. So I checked out Yelp and decided to to try this restaurant. It's a little awkward because the door to the bar is on the Main Street but you have to walk down an alley to get to the door of the dining room. 
We were the only ones in the dining room. The bartender came to give is menus and to take our drink orders. She was very nice and explained what the dinner special was. A few minutes later the owner or head chef came to our table. He was really funny. He had a very thick Italian accent. He told my husband to try the special and told me I should try the lemon chicken. His name was Lou and he takes food seriously. 
My husband ordered the special-Chicken Chiu Chiu pasta. It was grilled chicken, sliced banana peppers, mushrooms, and rigatoni noodles. It sounds pretty simple but whatever they put in the sauce was absolutely delicious. I am not able to eat spicy food so while this dish carried a little heat I could have eaten it. I was bummed I had not ordered it myself. 
I ordered the Lemon Chicken and was pleasantly surprised. Usually Lemon chicken has a lemon sauce that only has a hint of lemon. Because of that I asked if it came with capers. The waitress told me no but that they would put some on for me. Once I tasted the dish I realized that the sauce was so good that it didn't need capers. It was the best Lemon Chicken I had ever had. The portion size was huge. 
It was a surprise that my meal was just chicken-no sides or even a salad. Even though my order was all chicken I took half of it home. My husband's dish came with garlic bread but no sides or salad. He took 1/3 of his home. 
The prices were low, portions were huge, and our meals were great. We want to go back to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Very good!  The dinning room is located in the back behind the bar.  You must get the fried zucchini!  Their breading is so light yet flavorful!  The portions for the entrées were HUGE!  Service was great, and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"I have passed this bar more times that I can keep track of and finally popped in last night with a friend. It seems like a typical mousehole of a bar upon first glance, blending in seamlessly with all the other establishments that populate this side of the Boulevard. 

Who knew they had a nice, and spacious dining room in the back, complete with a big flatscreen TV? 

I really had no idea what to order as the dinner fare is typical upscale American/Italian; lots of seafood, steak, pasta, veal, and chicken dishes. 

A little cherub told me they had excellent meatballs, and I can't get enough ground meat, so I got the Spaghetti and Meatballs. 

My only errr...beef about it was that I only got two meatballs, but they were as fat, flavorful, and rich as any I have ever had. One more would have been nice though.  They are generous with the spaghetti, which is al dente, thick like bass strings, or Todd McFarlane's rendition of Spidey's webs. Tom DeFalco, Editor In Chief of Marvel at the time and Italian himself, called it \"spaghetti webbing.\" Moonlite Cafe's spaghetti is why. 

The sauce was THROUGH THE FLOORBOARDS! So was the juice that seeped to the bottom of the plate. I used to wonder why some people refused to eat spaghetti sans bread. What else are you gonna sop up all that delightful mess left behind with?

My friend let me taste the Moonlite Ziti, and it was very garlicky with nice bits of tomato adorning the plate. 

The salad I ordered came with an atomic house dressing too. 

Was tonight's secret word \"TANGY?\" 

Well, at least the Moonlite Cafe is no longer a secret. Venture into Brookline and come here if you like good, classy, but simple, traditional food."}
{"text":"The Moonlite Cafe is one of my favorite spots in the Brookline/Beechview area. 

Their Italian cuisine is extremely good and is extremely reasonably priced, especially so with their daily specials. On Thursdays you can get parmesan chicken with a side and pasta for only $9.99. It's also very delicious. 

The draft selection is limited but is served ice cold in frosted glasses. And when I say ice cold, I mean it. Often times some beer slush will accumulate at the top of my drink. It's delicious. 

The staff is also very friendly and are quick. 

I highly recommend the wedding soup and chicken Parmesan."}
{"text":"Checked this place out tonight and can't wait to go back.  We are new to the area and are slowly checking out our neighborhood watering holes.  I was really impressed with the Buffalo Ranch wings.  The flavor was excellent but the wings were perfect crisp!  We will definitely be back to try other menu items."}
