{"text":"They have the best lasagna and the best meatballs in town!  They are also very friendly and give huge portions.  Definitely worth trying!  I have... several times!!!"}
{"text":"- stopped through the other night out of laziness for cooking dinner - enormous portion of spaghetti and meatballs - asked for extra sauce (thank you!!!) - was pretty impressed with the sauce, and the quality (and size) of the meatballs (there were two in the order). - for $9.03, you can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"The food is hot, fast and tasty with generous portions.  They give free samples, so you get to try before you buy.  The chicken parmesan and veal are my favourites."}
{"text":"ABORT! ABORT!  New owners. Vegetarian (VEGETARIAN.) lasagna. Filled with mushy zucchini and spinach. No more meat sauce. They did NOT tell me that when I ordered it.   Sign in the window still advertises \"Nonna's\" meatballs. LIES.  I had FINALLY got my boyfriend to come meet me for lunch and after raving about the lasagna that they USED to have I was excited to share some with him. But no. No meaty cheesy lasagna for Joe.  Extra weird-factor: They still have a photo of the original owner's parents on the wall behind the counter. WHY?"}
{"text":"The options on the harbourfront are rather limited, and this small hot table shines brightly as a quality lunch destination.  Very tasty veal and chicken parm sandwiches. Meatballs aren't really my thing normally, but they're excellent here.   They've been very kind with giving samples, and pretty much everything I've tried has been great. The cornbread is delicious, as are the soups.  Prices are reasonable. Expect to pay about $10 at lunch."}
{"text":"This definitely isn't the best Italian in town, but it is for its location which doesn't have a whole lot of good choices. Plus it's filling and inexpensive. Just get the large sized hero and you'll get two meals for $8. The meatball hero is excellent as is the veal. And as mentioned, the ladies are lovely and the samples are a great way to figure out what you want."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)  MASSIVE portions and great value. For around $8, the lasagna or the shepherd's pie are good for 2, or at least 1.5 meals.   The food itself is hearty and perfect when you feel like someone homemade but are too lazy/exhausted to actually cook. The shepherd's pie is nicely done, although there is something I found a bit weird about the flavour of the gravy -- so I would suggest getting it on the side and seeing if you like it first. The lasagna is also really good, although the noodles were just *slightly* overcooked in my opinion.   In addition to the sandwiches and pasta, they have some salads (chick pea/bean salad, greek, etc.) to go."}
