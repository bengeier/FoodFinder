{"text":"Been here few times, pizza is good and service is great, I was also enjoying Israeli music that was playing."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas!!!!!! Finally a pizza place worth going to! My whole family always enjoys the food!"}
{"text":"I thought that pizza was terrific! Service was excellent and very friendly. Greek and Cesar salads were very good."}
{"text":"This place is an overpriced peice of garbage. I took iced coffee and I got warm diluted coffee instead. I took eggs which was raw on top and overcooked on bottom. And I couldn't wash down my food because the coffee was gross and diluted. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Awesome,  I leave rare reviews only on off the beat places.  This place is nice. Passed it by mistake. Soft music and interesting smells. NO meat items here (and I'm an meat lover). Ordered the Sambusk with feta YUM. My friend ordered the Shukshuka. Wow everything has that powerful flavor you expect from Mediterranean style.  Open late yah. Lots of lite things to choose from just to close the appetite."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Simon and joe is a delight. Tasty sambosak and the best tasty pizza. Simon is a generous host. Rafael and Maytal Cohen from Los Angeles"}
{"text":"Hidden away - I would have never know about nor found this place without yelp. I had what looked like a calzone. It was perfect. Delicious, interesting, a wonderful mix of textures. It came with three different sauces, a tomato,  a tahini, and a garlic-ish one.  I ate every thing all up.  These guys have only been opened 3 weeks. I hope people find it and come here in droves.   Open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I was just there , the pizza was delicious !!!! Also the service was good and homey :)    .."}
{"text":"Excellent  pizza  . It actually took less time for the pizza to be ready than they originally told me. Came with a really good garlic dipping sauce. Takeout pie with two topping $10.80 including tax !!!!!"}
{"text":"Great kosher pizza place. Very convenient to the the Vegas Strip. Under new ownership. Open Saturday night after sundown. Enjoyed the food very much."}
{"text":"This establishment is very very good food is excellent service is very good.  When in Las Vegas we tend to come here often"}
{"text":"Simon and Joes is a modern/retro dairy Israeli restaurant. They have Israeli music playing and great service. The quality of the pizza was even better than most NYC establishments. I ordered a pizza and told them to surprise me with the toppings."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is so yummy and they deliver which is so helpful. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"It is sad that as of now this is the only kosher pizza in vegas. As a resident that keeps kosher nearly every time we order the restaurant fails to make one of our pizzas. This is both for dine in and carry out. It seems that no one is managing the back of house operations. The food is good. The service not so much."}
{"text":"Fresh Kosher food, close to the Strip. I usually end up ranting about how overpriced most Kosher places in Vegas are, but this one is appropriately priced for specialty cuisine without taking advantage of the niche market.  Favorite thing here so far is the burekas- I get the cheese but potato and pizza flavors are also available. They have pizzas, soups, and salads, along with more specialty items like sambusak, ceviche, shakshuka, and khachapuri.   Location is kind of in a run-down and sketchy area, interior is pretty plain and service is average. Come here for takeout."}
{"text":"Omg this place is killer !!! Under new ownership I guess? Who cares! It's off the charts!  I ordered the quesadilla with tomatoes and it was cooked to perfection. My 8 Month pregnant wife, very picky at this stage, ordered a fettuccine Alfredo and loved every bite. We then split a calzone.... Mmmm delicious. We ended with a happy ending.... tiramisu. Wow. We couldn't resist and ordered another. You guys rock! Love it!!"}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for business, and I Simon & Joe's delivery twice to my hotel convention (through Postmates), and I ate in once.  Although I've been to Vegas several times, I had never eaten here, and was happy to find it.  The staff was friendly, and the food was good.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious, staff was super nice and Price was great. The environment was kid friendly, which was a big plus!  Wish we had pizza like this back home.  Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"As good or better than any NY kosher pizza. The pizza is excellent, prices fair, service is more than you'd expect, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and service was wonderful the prices are affordable and the menu is great I will definitely recommend to come here for kosher food and I and other things"}
{"text":"Omg, just ordered the white pizza. This has got to be the best pizza on the planet. It looked closed but there was an open sign.  Im so glad I checked it out, wow!"}
{"text":"So, I didn't expect this one at all... I had a meeting next door to this place when I noticed the delicious smell come. in out of there and followed it right in.. Pretty much everything we tried was delicious, the pizza, burekas, amd specially the shakshuka, yumm..  The place looks modern and have a very good vibe  I am not a local, so i can't come regulaly, but will Sure come by next time I'm visiting vegas  Special shoutout for joe.. gave us great sevice See u soon !"}
{"text":"Not open when listed on their hours.  REALLY sketchy location.  I'd advise all to just go a half-mile east and forget this place exists."}
{"text":"Food was okay. A typical pizza style place, you would find almost anywhere. When they get busy, they are very overwhelmed. They try hard. Not the cleanest place, but that is also because they are understaffed. A great place though to take kids. It is very close to the strip, so it is also a good place to run to for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience at this place. Their service is really tremendous and the food is delicious! They go above and behind to make sure you have best experience."}
{"text":"This place was definitely worth it. Pizza was perfect  The place easy to find. Few min from main strip.  Nice stuff.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! You won't find pizza like this anywhere, I guarantee and that's coming from a guy that lives in ny we're you can find pizza on every block.   I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I really hate writing a \"bad\" review on a kosher restaurant because all in all the food was good but the service was simply HORRIBLE.. We sat for two hours for a pizza there's one lady there and I'm not sure if she's the server and the cook but they really need to hire more help because two hours at a pizzeria is simply ridiculous. We waited 30 min just for the bill and to get my card back."}
{"text":"Heard about this place via Eater Las Vegas. Restaurant is in a sketch complex and can be mistakenly passed on by. However, food was delicious and the restaurant owner was appreciative of our time. Ordered the Pizza De La Rosa with mushrooms and my boyfriend ordered the Pizza Bureka. We were both delighted! Definitely a great hole in the wall restaurant that we plan to revisit."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and had the best experience! The owner gave us amazing service  Food was absolutely delicious and homemade tasting- super fresh- clean- overall a fantastic experience  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza and the owners are very nice. I really recommend  it and good prices"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! My husband and I loved the food was delicious we had the khachapuri and it was heaven!!! Owners are simply amazing and a pleasure to deal with U would highly recommend it to anyone!!! Amazing food and service"}
{"text":"I tried S and J three times before writing this review. I wanted to give them a fair chance. I'll use bullet point to expedite the process.   -1st time ordered Pizza with onion and mushrooms. Asked for it well done. The result was a less than normally done pizza. Wouldn't have been a problem if I had an oven at my office but no dice. Decent flavor, but a super limp pizza is a no go for me. 3/5  -2nd time went during normal business hours and they were closed. The adjacent door to the kitchen was open, so I harkened hello.. nice gentleman explained that they are closed at the time but I can go no next door to their sandwich shop (no sign or distinguishing marked) and order a sandwich. Proceed to sandwich shop. The interior was very informal with no indication of what they serve or menu. I actually felt like I was in the middle east and I am ok with that. Two guys behind a metal work station. Very nice people again, asked me what I would like. I told them just make the best sandwich you have. I received about a 8 inch sub with 2 slices of turkey and 2 slices of bologna, which some standard vegetables on top and a unidentifiable spread. They served it as a pressed sandwich, very pressed. 12.99 with a drink, which you could not opt out of the drink, $15 or so out the door with tax and tip. No chips or sides included. 2/5  -3rd time just ordered a Caesar Salad, with an anchovy (not included) on the side. The dressing was outstanding for a not made at table side authentic dressing. Tons of garlic which I love. I guess they can't use parmesan cheese so they substitute it with feta which I was ok with that. My main problem with the salad is that the lettuce was shredded, like McDonald Big Mac shredded and very limp, like a couple of days old limp. 2/5  Side notes:  Main restaurant seating and decoration is outstanding. Too bad there was not a single person there at any of the 3 times I visited.   Staff and what I believe to be one or two of the owners were super friendly. Props.   They need to change the signage on the storefront. It suggests that they are open 24 hrs. They are not. They are not even open sometimes during their regular business hours posted on yelp.   Final thought. I am not fully sure what Kosher is all about, but I surmise that it is a ploy by the Jews to rake in more money for a mediocre product."}
{"text":"Five stars for the owner of that restaurant great food great service they just gave me the taste of Israel. I've been there for the last five times in their food is awesome. The taste of the salad is awesome you got to try it. The taste of the pizza is different so good you have to try it. I think that the service the restaurant are the best in Vegas thank you so much for good service will see you again..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best tasting dough ever! So soft and tasty to bite into honestly really good and the cheese is super good not too muchh love this kosher restaurant"}
{"text":"Great pizza and food.  We love going there to eat pizza and all types of Italian and Mexican food.  Comfortable booths and a relaxing atmosphere.  Also great to go food.  Great food for a party or just a private dinner at home."}
{"text":"Very good food , different and authentic.  The service was amazing and will b back for sure.  I loved the variety and ready to try more !!"}
{"text":"What an awesome selection of dairy, Mexican, and Italian foods! I consider myself a critic in that I find something to complain about everywhere I go but everything here was above and beyond perfect. Creative and extremely delicious appetizers, dinner was tasty and ready fast, and desert was on part with the most expensive restaurants I've been to. Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Finally a good kosher dairy restaurant in Vegas! Awesome food, wonderful service. Really enjoyed eating here! Keep up the good work! :-)"}
{"text":"In a quiet strip mall just off of the main Strip is this delightful restaurant. The pizza was great and we also had a Caesar salad. Nothing fancy and nothing really outstanding..just good Pizza for a fair price"}
{"text":"THE WORST PIZZA AND CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I dont know where to start. I went to Vegas for exhibition. 2 days in row, we haven't got any decent kosher food. So, I saw this one, its said that it's the best pizza. So I was thinking, what could go wrong with pizza. Its just margerita pizza. I'm feeding 7 people (5 men and 2 women).  So, I ordered 2 pies. It said that they do delivery, but you have to call them again to confirm. They dont! Its through postmate and grubhub only.   It took 45-50mins for delivery, so its decent amount of time. I opened the pizza.  No napkins, no parmesan, no condiments, no chilli flakes. NOTHING. So I called, to let them know, and I asked for what I supposed to get. She said, I have to request it.   So stingy with condiments and napkins, I got pissed. She made bad joke about it \"do you want me to give you money back for napkins? Im sorry, being the best pizza has nothing to do with napkins *giggles\"...   And theeeeen... I tried the pizza. The gave us old hardass pizza i've ever had in my life. I put it on video. I've had bad pizza, but this is the worst.   They gave us 2 pies, 1 old 1 new, the new 1 was okay. At least its warm. The old 1, dry, cool, dried out cheese, flattened pie and hard to bite. Not edible for human. If you wanna cheat your customer, at least give us 2 bad pizzas so we wont tell the difference.  Then I said,, FUCK YOU. I dont curse alot and I have huge tolerance and this one is beyond stupid.   Im sorry, they did not deserve a fuck you. They deserves my colleagues prayers, prays that this place to close soon for being cheap, cheat and horrible customer service. Maybe you should just open resto in a zoo, i dont think your product and service is for human."}
{"text":"I found the place open and ready for business.  I called ahead to confirm.  I had the Greek salad.   It was good.  It hit the spot for me.   Nothing to brag about but was what I was looking for.  I was staying across the street at the La Quinta and walked over.  Very convenient."}
{"text":"I can't say enough bad things about this place. The food was terrible. The pizza is greasy, the salmon was super dry and inedible. I got the cheese boat which was pretty good but they failed to tell me about the added charges. They charged me $1.50 for, literally, three leaves of spinach. Seriously.  To make it worse, a nut came into the restaurant, threatened to shoot it up, was cussing at me and my husband, and even when I told the employee, they still didn't ask him to leave. We literally felt threatened and not at all safe! We even called the police and they didn't even show! When the owner finally threw him out, we got a half-hearted apology and charged full price for the crappy food!  It was very scary and ruined our first night in Vegas. We would never go back there just based on the food but the reaction of the owner to a possibly dangerous situation sealed the deal. If I didn't want to get out of there so badly, I would have demanded a discount on my food at the very least."}
{"text":"Wow, i got lucky when I found this spot, amazing food, everything I tried so far tasted great"}
{"text":"My grandma and I walked into this place on a Monday afternoon. There were about ten tables and all but two were covered in dirty dishes and food. Only one table was occupied and no one was at the counter. No one greeted us. We stood there for a bit and then left. I couldn't eat surrounded by that mess!"}
{"text":"It sounded like a great place..BUT IT IS NOW CLOSED AND EMPTY! How do you remove a place that has been closed for a while?"}
{"text":"If your ever in Vegas, you need to stop by this hidden gem. I was looking for a true kosher eatery and stumbled upon Simon & Joe's. Their pizzas are full of flavor with fresh ingredients. I have yet to try any other dishes but I am sure they are delicious. If you can catch Simon or Joe there, they are great guys who will take care of you."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of helping Simon and Joe get this place in order for opening. They are wonderful gentlemen, I told them when it opens I'll stop in for a bite, that is exactly what I did. Everything we ate (my coworker & I) was delicious! The waitress was knowledgeable and fully capable of answering questions, she also informed us everything was made fresh onsite bread, sauces, etc. QUALITY you can taste for sure! They did a wonderful job on the interior of the restaurant (if you could see what it looked like before you would be blown away)! Will be coming back again and again! Plus any place that plays Bob Marley in the back is alright by me! My first kosher dining experience and will not be my last!"}
