{"text":"FRESH. He's not rushing, takes his time understanding your order and making it. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here maybe 6 or 7 times, I usually get the Shish Taouk which is consistently very good.  The chicken is well seasoned  and nicely grilled, it is  tender and not dried out.  The rice is nicely cooked and not mushy \" I hate mushy rice\" . The potatoes don't always seem super fresh but they're not bad.  The hummus and garlic sauce is good but they don't give you enough for my liking.  My main complaint would be the falafel. Sometimes the falafel is awesome and tastes nice and fresh, crispy on the outside soft and fluffy on the inside, other times it tastes old and dried up.  The service is usually very good, quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating shawarma and I loved it.  Great customer service, amazing food.  10/10 would masticate again."}
{"text":"Let me start out with this: The place has potential and the food is decent. It's clean and has a nice atmosphere.  But If I'm going to pay 10+ dollars for a platter at a Lebanese restaurant (ordered a falafel platter) I should be guaranteed to receive a healthy assortment of rice, potatoes, hummus, salad, etc. The platter I ended up receiving had 5 falafels (sign advertised that you would receive 6), some decent rice, a very small portion of salad and a bunch of pickles (who would want a mountain of pickles?).   The falafels were tasty and the rice was good but the selection and portions were lousy. The service was slow and disorganized (took at least 15 minutes to get take-out when there was nobody in front of me).   Would not repeat until they offer better platter combos. The reason that places like the Paramount or Extreme Taste are always packed is because they either have a great price point or the portions are large. I get it that it is a new business and the owners are trying to make money, but you won't be getting many repeat customers like this."}
{"text":"Yonge and Bloor neighbourbood lacks an affordable & clean location where you can enjoy a fresh, healthy and delicious meal. This location is clean, the food is freshly cooked and the service is very friendly. I've had quite a few of their dishes and I love every single one of them. If you live in the neighbourhood or are passing by, I recommend that you come by and try it. You'll notice how clean this location is right when you walk in the front door and you can taste the freshness in your first bite - a far cry from other Shawarma locations in Toronto."}
{"text":"one word . . . F-R-E-S-H!!!!!  Grabbed a quick bite this aft, left a very happy boy!   2 sandwiches . . . chicken shwarma + falafel. Both to die for. Extremely fresh ingredients, punchy full-flavours, hot sauce that actually packed some heat. Most other lebanese joints downtown seem to use weak, mass-produces commercial sauces that are totally weak. M'zaar makes their yummy sauce in-house.   * restaurant layout 5/5 * dude behind counter 4.5/5 * food 5/5 * price 4/5 * extensive take-out menu 5/5"}
{"text":"Had the shawarma plate. All of the vegetables were old and wilting and the chicken was dry. The portion was incredibly frugal, which is fine because most of it ended up in the garbage. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"This is one of the tastiest Lebanese places in town. Everything seems fresh and the staff seem genuinely interested in the food.   So far I've had the shawarma, grape leaves, and the lentil stop. The soup, omg! So good."}
{"text":"Delicious food especially the Falafel. However, i wish waiters and cooker wear gloves all the time especially when they hold breads"}
{"text":"Nice clean place. Good atmosphere and best shawarma in the area. Found their beef kebab plate the best. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Superb place!! Very kind people. I had the falafel sandwich and it was exactly what i wanted! Freshly made falafel super fresh veggies. Loved this place. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am Lebanese and I know good Lebanese food. None of this Paramount, Ali Baba, Quick pita commercial food joints. M'zaar is where you want to go for the best homemade Lebanese food in the city!   I have tried their chicken and beef shawarma, also their shish taouk (souvlaki-like chicken) and fish. Everything tastes fresh and is made the day of.   A must try!!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend got a good feed. Only 23 dollars for two shawarma and two drinks. Money for jam. Very tasty food, it just slid down the hatch with all the sauces they dish up. 5 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Lebanese food. Prepared fresh every time so it takes some time but it's well worth the wait. We've been back 3 times in a week; we just can't get enough.  Service is friendly and warm, a great alternative to a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Very good lebanese food I recommend it I tried the chicken shawarma sandwich & the falafel wrap"}
{"text":"Stopped by for snack for shopping around Yorkville area.  The first impression is restaurant is decently clean.  Try chicken shawarma sandwich.  The ingredients seem fresh and portion is fair.  As for the flavour, it was ok and I do feel the chicken was too lean for me as I normally would prefer a but fat.  I don't think the taste is too different from other shawarma place.  The difference is service here is quite friendly as well as dining area and washroom are well maintained and clean.  The price is reasonable for the area it locates."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a Shawarma in the area. The chicken schawarma plate is always delicious and comes with a heaping quantity of food. As a fairly big male, I have trouble finishing the meal.   The guys behind the counter are awesome. Always nice to talk to and love to joke around. It's  a clean/new establishment.   After trying a couple others in the area I won't go anywhere else for some delicious Lebanese food."}
{"text":"The services is the worse and The falafel is cold . the bold guy is talking too much about himself who really care. Never go back"}
{"text":"Are you looking for good Lebanese food?  Want it to be well priced?  Do you want large portions? (Large, if you're a skinny guy like me.)  This is your place.   Great selection of Lebanese food. The menu can be confusing, but once you've got your bearings you will be fo"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I personally get the chicken schwarma with a falafel mixed in usually. Everything I've tried so far has been excellent."}
{"text":"As noted by others, good chicken shawarma. Clean establishment with friendly staff and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came here for chicken shawarma but was really impressed by the crispy, airy falafels that are formed and made to order. Definitely one of the best falafels I've ever had.   The salads that came with the shawarma are quite fresh given that I was coming in around 8pm.   The friendly, professional customer service adds major points to the overall experience. You can tell that they put a lot of care into making sure that the customers are happy."}
{"text":"I ordered a falafel plate from M'Zaar, and it was delicious and very fresh! It definitely stands out from the many shawarma/falafel places that you can find in and around the city. The falafel plate was well balanced (veggies, rice, amount of falafel, sauces/hummus, pickles) and for around $8, a great deal too. The falafel was very crunchy and crisp, and a welcomed depart from the soggier falafels that many places serve.   Additionally, the owner was very friendly, and the overall vibe of the place is one that will keep us coming back for seconds!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a schwarma in the Yonge and Bloor area, head over to M'zaar!  This eatery is new and a bit nicer than other schwarma options in the area.  I ordered the chicken schwarma plate to go.  It was huge! All the items were fresh and the chicken was juicy.  The roasted potatoes were deliciously seasoned.  I was hungry and I was happy I went with a plate.  However, I wish the portion of salad was larger. Also, the babaganoush was very salty. I originally wanted a veggie wrap but they did not have grilled eggplant that day.  Overall, I liked my meal and the service was super friendly.  This place is still new and I will return to try something else. :)"}
{"text":"Was excited to visit after reading good reviews but was disappointed with hygiene and food quality. Horrible experience. The environment is clean but I can't say the same about food prep, the guy who made my sandwich had one glove on and handled cash and the debit machine with the same glove on between making wraps before he put them on the hot press. I figure I'll survive, having served myself I know most restaurants are actually pretty unclean so I didn't make a fuss as it's cheap food, you get what you pay for right? I was wrong. The beef shawarma wrap was soggy on one side and the vegetable fillings were cold and limp. It wasn't even circular. It was more like a foldover omelette with refrigerated fillings. The beef was overpoweringly peppered and extremely tough and chunky. Ugh, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken Shwarma plate and it was simply delicious! The portion is huge! The plate included: chicken, rice, tahineh, potatoes and garlic, and veggies!  The service was great! My order was to go and the man who took my order was friendly and smiley! He also offered to caramelize the chicken!    The restaurant has a casual vibe, and the seating area is of average size!   Overall I was very satisfied with the food service and cleanliness!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, affordable, and definitely more than enough! It's worth the price for sure. The staff are very friendly, I like them."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly my favourite middle eastern takeaway. I go here once a week. The chicken Shwarma plate is super filling. Ask for extra hot sauce!"}
{"text":"First time here even though it's right around the corner from me. Really great chicken shawarma, I'll definitely return to try other items. The atmosphere was also nice and the service super friendly."}
{"text":"Portion becomes MUCH smaller compared with 6 months ago when their rating was not high."}
{"text":"This place is 5 minutes away from my office and I'm so happy that I stepped inside.  I decided to get the chicken shawarma plate because it looked huge and really varied, and everything from the potatoes with garlic sauce to the chicken shawarma was really well cooked and delicious. They serve it with hummus. I ordered the small portion but it was HUGE.  Also really competitive prices, good promotions on shawarma specials, and quick service.  Find a nice shawarma place near work: check! Satisfy shawarma craving: check!"}
{"text":"UNSANITARY!! HAIR ON FOOD!! SPIDER ON SALAD!!   My boyfriend and I had the worst experience at this restaurant ever.. There was a long strand of hair on my boyfriend's food and a bug/spider on my salad. Worst ever! We discreetly told the waiter as well as this guy who seemed to be the boss. The waiter, although he was helpful and seems to be apologetic about what happened, was giving us excuses about the hair. \"my hair is not even long... blahblahblah\" while the boss doesn't seem to care at all. All he said was \"oh! this things happens\".. no shit! This things shouldn't happen to any restaurant AT ALL. Their consolation, they made my boyfriend new set of shawarma and offered me new salad. Didn't want to take it but they insist on us paying even after our complains.   WORST.RESTAURANT.EVER."}
{"text":"Got a fresh app platter with hummus, tahini, grape leaves and salad as well as a Shishtouk plate. I like tve Baba Gabonoush the came with but my gf thought jt was too tahini/ garlicky. The plate was good but heavy on the garlic sauce and short on the potatoes. I'd said the food was a better grade than alot of generic Shwarma places in the area (I'm looking at you Ali Baba) but I'd still take Paramount in a middle eastern food matchup."}
{"text":"Last night an old friend of mine and I got together and decided we wanted to go out for Middle Eastern. Lately, I had been going to Paramount downtown but I wanted to expand my options so I checked out other top Yelp picks in the area. M'Zaar has higher reviews than Paramount so we decided to check it out.  So I'll say one thing, the service here is great! The people who work here are not only super friendly, with huge sincerely smiles, but they actually serve you with a sense of joy and pride in their work. That is quite a rare experience I believe.  The food itself was pretty good. I wouldn't say that is was standout amazing but it was a solid experience. I would have been happier with a bit more meat and the rice was a bit oilier than most middle eastern places but I'm just nitpicking because it was still a good meal. Had those details been different, I would EASILY give this place higher rating but still, as Yelp says, 3 is A-OK!    I will definitely come back in the future. :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. Expensive for what you get.   They advertise a dinner special that supposedly comes with a free soup for any purchase of a large plate. So I ordered a large beef kafta only to find out that it in fact does NOT come with soup.   The menu with pictures clearly indicates 3 skewers but.. no a \"large\" comes with two tiny skewers ($14+tax). It would be $19+tax if I wanted 3 skewers they said. Rice and salad included are probably the smallest portion I've had. Reading other reviews, I suspect they recently decreased their portion size while upping prices. Maybe to keep up with the increased Yonge taxes?  They advertise \"Lebanese food with a twist\" but seems standard fare to me.. No twist for me, just felt deceived.   If you want good food in the area, go to Salad House around the corner."}
{"text":"I work in the area and this is my favorite food place around. Almost everything on the menu is great. Their grilled fish combo is amazing. Always friendly courteous service."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by how cheap this place was compared to a lot of other Mediterranean places I've been to. There's quite a bit of variety for a smallish restaurant. I think most people come for takeout rather than eat in.  I came here and got the shish tawouk plate while my friend got the falafel plate. Both tasted quite good. Very satisfied! The one downside was that I expected a larger portion when I indicated I wanted \"large\". Yes, they gave me more meat but the rice and veggies portion were exactly the same as regular. I think next time I will either get a falafel plate or wrap bc I felt that it would be more worth my money (just a preference though)!  Overall, I quite like this place. It is pretty out of the way for me though, so I'd only go if I have a falafel craving."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The store owner is a great example of what a caring manager is. What a wonderful showcase of Lebanese culture. Keep it up"}
{"text":"This place really turns up the music. I don't know if it's just the volume levels of the songs themselves, or they're manually turning it up and down depending on which song they like, but at some parts the music was just blasting.  The restaurant offers take-out and dine-in.  If you're dining in, you would place your order, and then sit down and they'll bring it over. When you're ready to pay, you have to tell them what you ordered because the person handling managing the cashier is not necessarily the one that took the order.   The food was alright. Ordered a large chicken shawarma plate. I found the chicken to be a bit dry. Rice was flavorful. Vegetables were a bit too much on the sour side for me.  I think the volume gets me the most though, especially if you're trying to hold a conversation and then the volume suddenly goes way up."}
{"text":"If your looking for something fast and good this is the place to go. The chicken shawarma was delicious, just make sure to order your fries on the side if you're getting a combo otherwise you might get them in the shawarma lol"}
{"text":"Just ate here for a quick lunch. I had the beef kafta plate and my partner had the falafel plate. Both were delicious! The quality of the food is really high for a \"fast food\" kind of place. Portions were generous and prices are right. Great place! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"hands down some of the BEST tasting Middle Eastern food you'll have in Toronto.   be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes to get your food though.   staff is nice, but management can be a bit weird at times."}
{"text":"I decided to try this new Lebanese place which opened up in my neighbourhood.   Its the worst experience I have had at a fast food joint till date. The guy at the counter was really rude and un-interested in making a shawarma. I won't go into details about what happened but if you a see a guy with a scar on his face you don't wanna go in there.  As for the food I thought it was alright"}
{"text":"We had a vegetarian platter and a chicken shawarma dinner. Both were very good. Compared to some other middle eastern restaurants, I find the veggies here more fresh. I also like how the plates come with hummus. A lot of places don't give you hummus with the plates.  Their falafels seem more \"fresh\" than other places too. It has more green than other falafels. I'm guessing they use a different proportional of chick peas and other ingredients. The taste is good. I still think Sababa's falafel is the best.  The chicken shawarma tastes like chicken shawarma. I really don't have any complaints about the food. It's much better than the Ali Baba variety.   The decor is nicer than your average middle eastern place. In general I don't find middle eastern restaurants very nice to sit in. M Zaar is not fancy, but it's much more dine-in friendly than most.   In terms of prices, they are fair. It's not cheap, but it's not as expensive as Paramount. When you consider the portion and quality, it's worth my money. I will come again."}
{"text":"Great Vegeterian Options.   Love the Saj Bread and Fresh Falafel.   Even the Hummus has a Great Taste to it. Absolutely recommend it."}
{"text":"the best place for shawarma plate - dont really know why there are negative reviews saying its overpriced since the same people are always working in the store and this generates consistency in portion size, taste and customer service - food is really tasty and they dont skimp out on anything - potatoes with garlic sauce is the best in toronto, honestly dont know if its the way they make the potatoes or the sauce itself - for 10 bucks you can get a really large meal, i usually split and save half for dinner since im a pretty light eater - the thing i like is that the chickens not drenched in oil and theyre happy to accommodate dietary needs  highly recommend anyone to stop by here and give mzaar a try."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious; service was a bit slow but they made up for it by giving us an extra order on the house; my husband is Lebanese so we are excited to have another good option to choose from; highly recommend the lentil soup! Would give five stars for bigger portions."}
{"text":"Our first time going there and the guy was so friendly. He even gave us a free chicken shawarma prior to us finishing our meal, which he promised if my boyfriend didn't like his order. I had the falafel sandwich and my other half had the caramelized onion beef shawarma. All three were excellent and the prices can't be beat! Will definitely be back. If you like good Lebanese/Mediterranean food and don't want to break the bank, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"New authentic Lebanese. Delicious fresh high-quality ingredients.  Friendly staff. The meat was so tender. The baklavas so sweet."}
{"text":"3.5  ive had a lot of middle eastern food and this place is better than average.  not much to say but clean and the setup is decent.  i had fallafel plate it was a okay..good... portions were not that but.  i will try again another dish and update my review to see if perhaps the shawarma is better to order..."}
{"text":"that eggplant spread whose name i can't remember is delicious!  chicken shawarma is okay, a bit too garlicy and very little meat in it. overall tasty  nice decor, friendly staffs. not bad"}
{"text":"Stepped into this place for lunch on the way back to the office.  The restaurant looked fresh, modern, and inviting.  So I decided to step inside.  What really caught my eye was the 2 chicken shawarma special that was advertised in the window.  For $9.99, that is quite a deal and great to share with a friend/co-worker (or eat the second one for dinner).  Staff was friendly and the service was quick which is so key when trying to attract the lunch crowd.  The shawarma was packed full of all the good things you would expect in the warm pita bread.  The pickled veg brought acidity while the lettuce and tomato gave it more body and some crunch.  Chicken was juicy and a little crispy after being cooked on the flat-top.  I wasn't asked if I wanted hot sauce in my shawarma as that would have been the cherry on top as I did ask for \"the works\".    It wasn't a deal breaker by any means but will be more vocal about it next time.  Looking forward to visiting again in the future when I am craving shawarma."}
{"text":"M'Zaar Restaurant was actually one of the first places that I visited when I started reading Yelp reviews, and although I am not sure what I had then (possibly a falafel plate), I do recall that I enjoyed my meal very much. But then for some reason, I had not been back since then. (Probably too many other new places to try?) So I returned last weekend while I was in the area, and had another great meal. The restaurant itself is very nice inside: very clean with wood serving counter and tables, brickwork on some walls, and seating for about 20 people. The service was pleasant and my food was ready fairly quickly.  The full menu is displayed on 3 LCD screens, and has a variety of shawarma and kebab plates and wraps. The plates come with rice and potatoes, and a variety of salads. After browsing the menu, I decided to have something a little different - the grilled sea bass plate. The fish was excellent, tender enough to cut with the plastic fork, but not too soft. The rice and potatoes were fine, and the turnips and pickles and green salad all seemed fresh. The serving size was very good, a plate really full of food for $10. Most of the plates are around the same $10-12, and the wraps/sandwiches $6-7.  Definitely a hearty recommendation; certainly the best place that I have been for Lebanese food. I will not be waiting another 2yrs to return next time."}
{"text":"Love this place, discovered it last month and I am a regular now. This is the best shawarma place in the Yonge and Bloor area. Nice and clean place with friendly staff and reasonable pricing...RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"This is my regular lunch spot. The owner Mo makes this place. He's always very engaged with his customers and always making sure everybody is enjoying their food.The food is a plus for me. The chicken shawarma and falafel plate are my favourite. Great lunch specials as well. Its definitely a must try."}
{"text":"So cheap! Restaurant was so clean, has a nice dine in area and I had the best crispy chicken showarma ive ever had here! Strongly recommend!!! The plate was below 10$! The wraps are even cheaper! Best shawarma"}
{"text":"M'Zaar has been my go-to place for chicken shawarma ever since I moved downtown. I always get the wrap, which is lightly grilled to make it crispy. The chicken is tender & marinated well, and the tahini & garlic sauce gives it a bit of zing. The rest of the ingredients (tomato, lettuce etc) are fresh as well. I'm just not a fan of their pickles but that's my own preference. For a little over $6 bucks, it makes a pretty satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Honestly, it was so delicious!! Got a chicken shawarma plate. Chicken was moist, came with roasted potatoes (so good), and rice and salad. The portions were totally worth the price and all the sauces were amazing. Very happy with this meal and I was craving it the next day."}
{"text":"Highly recommended Arabic restaurant! Chicken shawarma in here is the best. Even my Arabic friend said great. price is also acceptable. If you try here at once, you cannot go another Arabic restaurant."}
{"text":"I came to M'Zaar last summer but I still remember it because it was that good! The people were really nice and the food was really good. Affordable as well. Definitely stop by if you're nearby!"}
{"text":"The shwarma came on a homemade pita which really you won't find in the city.  It was fabulous!  Fresh ingredients, delicious sauces and not dripping with grease.  Really hit the spot"}
{"text":"Was good but now the portions are way too small. For a $13 plate I received just a pinch of chicken. Really disappointing that I need to find a new place for shawarma now."}
{"text":"Decided to drop in because it was convenient. Delicious food and done quickly. Really enjoyed my chicken shawarma sandwich from here"}
{"text":"\"It's fine.\"  I was a few bites into my Chicken Shawarma Sandwich when I muttered the above words to nobody in particular.  The product being offered at M'Zaar will certainly satisfy one's craving for a shawarma, but there's absolutely nothing in it that'll knock one's socks off.  It's assembled really well, I'll give it that. Sometimes when you eat a shawarma wrap, the entire thing falls apart long before you reach the final few bites. But the shawarma I got from M'Zaar retained its structural integrity all the way to the end, which is in itself nothing short of a miracle. (Although it probably helps that the wrap was woefully undersauced, to the point where it was actually pretty dry in spots.)  The toppings were all fine, and so was the chicken. The meat was almost completely lacking in those coveted crunchy bits, but really, given the intense mediocrity of everything else, I wasn't in the least bit surprised about that.  I suppose I would order food from M'Zaar again in a pinch, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to munch on their wares."}
{"text":"Amazing Lebanese Food!  Everything tastes as it should. My sister and I are lebanese ourselves and we can say this place offers amazing lebanese food :)   Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken shawarma here.  Best I've had in a long time!  I had the small platter.  Potatoes were cold though.  Also had a tabouleh to go.  Dining area is a bit small though, so I wonder if seating would be a problem during the busy peak hours.  I was here on a Saturday late afternoon.  Prices were alright.  Yelp app isn't working properly still, so I had deleted my photo."}
{"text":"Just found this place on yelp. Fresh ingredients, yummy food,g rear prices ( my massive Sharma salad was 6.99+tax) and the owner is super friendly. Glad to have found it :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now, and, although I'm not a big fan of Lebanese food (nor do I claim to know much about it), M'zaar is delicious, quick and with fair pricing.   There's a huge shawarma at the back where they slice off the meat when you order, and they ask if you want the food spicy or not. If you want it spicy, they drizzle in some sort of spicy-looking sauce that is actually quite mild in flavor. The food is always hot and fresh, plus it comes with some nice sides if you want them.   I prefer the wraps over the plates (they grill the wrap to make it crispy!) and you can also order their food off of the Ritual app. I usually take my food to-go, but if you dine in, there is always a lot of space for you to eat at."}
{"text":"I don't even like chicken, but a coworker shared one of their lunches with me and now I go here at least once a week for a chicken (breast) wrap.  Great prices and incredible wraps.  The cooks (super nice guys) make it in front of you and fills the pocket with so many great things my mouth waters just watching.  I have bought this wrap on my way home from work for dinner, rode the subway for 20 minutes and ate it when I got home......STILL DELICIOUS even after sitting that long.  Only drawback is the restaurant is warm so I seldom stay in to eat it.  Recommend highly, but mostly for takeout orders."}
{"text":"Food is quite tasty but the owners really make it special here. They are incredibly nice people and let you substitute sides at your demand. Recently it's gotten a bit too expensive compared to nearby places but it's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Some locals told me this was the best shawarma place to try so I did.  It delivered.  Saw a 2 chicken shawarma wrap for $9.99 until 5pm deal so I got that, plus an order of baba ghannouj, and kafta to try.  They were super delicious.  The dark meat and the french fries inside the wrap was also an added bonus.  I can eat this wrap every day.  I burped garlic for the remainder of the night so heads up on that if you're going back to work."}
{"text":"Love the food! Everything made fresh to order, Shish Tawouk, Soujouk Spicy Sausage, Vegetarian Platter & Delicious Lentil Soup. My go to place for Lebanese with a twist & with friendly service."}
{"text":"M'Zaar Restaurant looks very clean and nice. Great location, not far from Yonge and Bloor.  One of the employees was friendly, the other one not so much. Looked like he has a bad day. I ordered Chicken Shawarma wrap that was pretty big and costs $6. It was toasted lightly and I walked few blocks before eating. What a mess. The garlic sauce was overpowering. Way too much garlic sauce, he didn't even ask if I wanted it. Chicken pieces were both dark and white meat, also lots of fat pieces. The wrap was felling apart, soggy and wet from juices. There was actual liquid (I guess from chicken) leaking out. I could barely eat half, the rest went to trash. I think Chicken Shawarma Platter would be much better. Their hummus is okay, but nothing special. I am not sure I will give a second try. I would also add a picture but it was nothing pretty."}
{"text":"As some of you know, I love to find those places that are tucked away and at the same time are one of the best places to eat for lunch.  I found this place while walking down to ShareTea and thought it would be a good place to try for lunch one day. That day was today and I was delightfully pleased with how it went.  I ended up getting a standard falafel with everything in it (because why not?). But I was also surprised to see them offering Labneh and Kibbeh on the menu. As my father was from Lebanon, I found a lot of things that brought out my childhood.  The staff was a little stiff but the food spoke for itself. The location was clean and they seem to be up to date with today's tech as they promoted Ritual for those short on time.  Yes this is a great place to eat at, Yes I would definitely go here again, and yes you should go here too!"}
{"text":"This place is truly worthy of five big stars.  Firstly: The owner has excellent interpersonal skills.  I did not want potato or rice, and they happily substituted vegetables/salad.  Highly unusual - normally places won't substitute vegetables as it is more expensive than the rice/potato.  Secondly: FOOD IS CLEAN (vegetables are washed well) and the food is F.R.E.S.H.  I was very impressed.  My spouse goes there and recommended this place to me today as I was downtown on a course.  The owner KNOWS how to run a business.  This is a smart business person - who treats people WELL.  He will remain in business for a long time.  SHUKRAN HABIBI!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  Got the Kafta kebab twice and was filled to the brim! Food is flavourful, and each dish tastes different.  I love garlic, so they can pile it on and I won't complain. Portion sizes are quite big.  With the dinner you get: roast potatoes, salad, hummus, garlic sauce, rice, and your choice of meat."}
{"text":"Love this place! Live nearby and dont know how many times i've eaten from here. 2 chicken shawarmas for $10 is crazy value for an awesome meal for 2! Whenever i try other shawarma places, I compare to Mzaar and its very hard to beat. Very fresh vegetables, and good portions and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here yesterday. I had been craving \"my country food\" for over a week. The guy working here was very friendly and happy to serve us. He took our order and told us to have a seat. We both ordered caramelized  chicken shawarma. He brought them over within minutes. They were huge and delicious! Once we were done we paid. The guy working there was very thankful and appreciative of our business.   I will definitely go back here and highly recommend this place. Its warm and very, clean. SPOTLESS!"}
{"text":"Nice service, welcome atmosphere, great chicken shawarma with fries inside, fantastic mixed flavours, I brought an Egyptian friend to this place and he said this is the best place he ever had and also reminded him of high school memory."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, generous portions & tasty food. I dropped in for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed the chicken shawarma platter. So tasty, but more food than I could eat. The owner (who is working behind the counter) told me he had been open for just six months and that the food he serves is his passion. You can tell by the care that goes into what he serves. I will definitely be back when I am in Toronto again."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with their food especially that it was overpriced. I would have been happy if the portions were at least large. I usually get my food from Alibaba on Wellesley if I am into shwaramma and that sort of Lebanese food , but wanted to try this place. I paid 5 times the money I would have payed for the Alibaba 's happy hour plates and didn't get as much food as I expected, nor was the quality good. Nothing tasted fresh! AWFUL! Was very unhappy even when I started eating the food! The store owner tried to be friendly but got into politics  and middle-east problems which I am not interested to hear, especially when I eat out and over pay ! Never would go back or let any friend near this place"}
{"text":"A great Lebanese fusion restaurant. Fresh and convenient location. I had a chicken shawarma with caramelized onions and tabouleh. Only $6.49. There is seating and TV in the casual seating restaurant. Washrooms downstairs. Had a quick bite."}
{"text":"This is my go-to takeout spot for cheap and delicious Lebanese food. The staff is always pleasant and the food portion is more than enough. Their regular size plate is just as filling for me as their large plates. Their caramelized onion chicken shawarma plate and their sea bass plate is a must try. It's in a great location too near bubble tea spots and board game spots so it's easy to plan an outing all together. I go there at least twice a month and the quality of the food has never disappointed me."}
{"text":"Been here three times, and each time the portions get smaller, and the prices are certainly not dropping. There is a lot of good to this place - fresh ingredients, tasty, variety of options, and service is alright. However, I am not a fan of buying a large dish, which in the past was filling and led to me recommending it to friends etc., to now receiving the same large container that is 1/4 empty for the same or possibly higher price - I was told that the prices have gone up, but I can't be sure.   Last night I ordered a large chicken shawarma plate and 4 falafels ($1 each) to go, and when I got home I found the portion to be small, and the falafels were placed on a bed of greens with no sauce. Really?!"}
{"text":"Passed by this place so many times and tried it for the first time today. I got the beef kafta plate on a large salad and skipped the rice and potatoes. The salads were nice and fresh. The beef was delicious! I will definitely go back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"The last time I came here it was a one man show and the owner who served 5 people in under 10 minutes...that guy was AMAZING, however today it was different staff helping me some chubby guy in a cap and a girl so that'sTWO PEOPLE  I ordered THE SAME THING I did last time and it took OVER 20 minutes and to make matters worse I got served LAST out of a line-up of 5 people even though I had placed my order BEFORE everyone else.  WTF M'zaar??? How is it that the one man can fulfill all those orders in half the time it took TWO PEOPLE to do in DOUBLE the amount of longer time??? FAIL!!!"}
{"text":"My goto Arabic joint in town. Great Arabic food at very affordable prices! The Hummous is excellent. Great Service and a very courteous service."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the last month since I moved a block away and they're on ritual which is so convenient!!  The beef kabob plate is absolutely delicious and the only thing I'd complain about is the the portion size though I did get the regular and will probably spring for the large next time.   The gentleman behind the counter is super friendly and ready to make recommendations if you don't know what you want!  They also have a chicken schwarma deal 2 for $10. I did find the chicken a bit boring ( I tried both the wrap and plate) but the sauces more than made up for it"}
{"text":"M'Zaar Restaurant serves up delicious Lebanese cuisine to lunch and dinner crowds on a busy strip of Yonge between Wellesley and Bloor. Between 11am and 3pm you can get a special for $9 that includes a sandwich, drink, and enough sides to fill the rest of that empty space in your stomach.  Curiousity led me to try out a mixed skewer plate, which was quite filling. Everything here tastes slightly different from the typical Mediterranean places I've had before, but in a good way. The flavours were spicy and the food tasted quite fresh.   Staff members are polite and will will bring your order to your table if you're dining in. For a break from the typical joints like Ali Baba's, this is a great option that isn't far out of the way."}
{"text":"So full.  So happy.  Amazing wholesome real food. Your chicken shwarma kept my boyfriend from blabbering on about being fed. Thank you."}
{"text":"Average food with average prices. Three stars truly means that this is not a place worth visiting unless you need some kind of food while you're in the immediate area. Take note of the MANY restaurants nearby that you could opt for instead.  I came here for lunch with my sister who assured me that this place has better Middle Eastern food than the other shawarma joint nearby.   She ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich wrap and I ordered the vegetarian platter, which the man behind the counter enthusiastically vouched for. The man who made our food asked my sister two times if she wanted hot sauce on her sandwich, although she had told him thrice already that she did not. That was pretty weird and annoying.  When our food arrived, the platter looked quite appetizing. Key word: looked. My sister enjoyed her shawarma sandwich, but I wasn't as swooned by the my food. The platter had two giant heaps of hummus, two stuffed grape leaves, two massive balls of falafel, and some tabbouleh. The hummus was bland and was missing a much needed olive taste. The falafel was weird: one falafel ball was cold and soggy while the other was fresh and hot. Umm...yeah..not fun to eat. The grape leaves were probably the only decent and expected thing about the place. Considering the place prides itself on being an authentic Lebanese restaurant, it was quite shocking that the pita they served with the platter was from a processed, factory made package. Yuck!  Considering the platter was costlier than the other meaty items on their lunch menu, it should have been more filling and appetizing, but it was truly neither. The tabbouleh didn't taste fresh, either, which I forgot to mention earlier.  Also, while we were eating, two young women sat beside us. While they were eating, the man behind the  counter offered them drinks on the house, and they insisted they didn't want any, and gave my sister and I an apologetic look. It was so weird that he practically begged them to take a free drink while he didn't do so much as smile at us. Weird? Creepy? Who knows.   The only pro about this place is that it's clean, the ingredients look fresh, and it claims to be halal. I didn't get a chance to inspect the halal thing further because I don't even eat meat anymore, so it doesn't concern me. But for those who do eat halal, you definitely should verify where they buy their meat.   To conclude: only go here if you're absolutely rid of all other options in the area, or really want a shawarma or something of the sort. Don't go for the hummus or anything of the vegetarian fare. Just don't."}
{"text":"Ordered a \"large\" chicken kabob plate ($14). It was the smallest and most expensive plate I've ever received from a shawarma restaurant. Maybe a half cup of rice and half a palm of salad, with all of 2 pcs of radish. The chicken looked really good but was overcooked and bland. The rice was also boring. While the server was nice, after I ordered another person came in and they were informed about a shawarma wrap special (2 for $10) . I would have ordered that if I knew, but it wasn't posted anywhere.   The best thing I can say is their sauces are amazing, especially that garlic sauce. Regardless, I left hungry & unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This is the best middle eastern restaurant in Toronto. Nothing compares to the quality and value of the food here. Amazing every time, the wait is always really short and the staff very friendly. Please do yourself a favour and eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"I was taking a bike ride up Yonge Street, on my way home, and wanted to pick up something great to eat.   I had seen this recently opened Lebanese joint a couple of times and it looked good from the outside, so what the heck ... I figured that I would give it a shot.  The owner was chilling out inside ... it was a little quiet due to Caribana festivities happening south of the downtown core.  I ordered the Falafel Platter ... which came with Fattoush Salad and Hummus.   What I liked was that everything came made fresh.  He took his time ... waited for the oil to get to the right temperature and put the fresh-made falafel mix into the fryer.  He put homemade tahini and hot sauce on the falafel ... served it on top of the fatuous, and put a bit of hummus on the side.  Just the right amount of food ... no pita to make it a heavy meal ... and flavour was bursting from every bite.  Most of the Lebanese joints I try out never make their falafel fresh, on the spot ... I typically walk out when this happens.   As it was slower, the owner Moe, engaged me in a great conversation about food.   He has a great philosophy ... it's all about freshness, whole ingredients, and flavour.  Check them out ... it'll be worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5, but rounded it up to a 4 in good faith, since this is a new place.   The atmosphere here is pretty calm. The thing that I liked most is that it is clean and friendly. I love the general layout (not like other shawarma places) and I love that they have a homey feel to it with a fake stone oven arc. Or at least I think that's what they were going for. In any case, I love it!  Service was quick, as I was the only one ordering.   I got myself a chicken shawarma wrap & baklawa (couldn't resist. For science!). The wrap was a good size for the price. You could tell that the ingredients and the meat were fresh!  The only problem I had with my shawarma wrap is that the chicken meat was on the dry side and could've used more tahini and garlic sauce, which I did order but didn't taste in my wrap at all. Don't be stingy with the sauce!!  The baklawa was as good as any other I've tried, but I suspect it is store-bought.   All in all, this will now become my go-to shawarma place, as it is not as sketchy looking as others. I have yet to find the TWIST that M'zaar claims to have in its food, though."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Saj chicken shawarma. Super tasty and so much food, I add their house made coleslaw to it (so good). It's big enough for lunch for two and only around $8. I get takeout here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a couple of times and would definitely recommend. Their chicken shawarma plate is great and the small is big enough to be two meals (if you're not super hungry)! Friendly staff and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"A stroll away from Wellesley Subway is M'Zaar, a Middle Eastern restaurant.  When you walk in, make sure you don't trip on the slight ledge.  Other than that, this simply adorned restaurant's greatest feature is .... food!!   I ordered a small plate of Shish Taouk, which came in a generous portion for $9.99.  It has one skewer of chicken on a plate filled with rice,  potatoes and salad.  The chicken was tender and flavourful.  You can order a large plate of their dishes for only $2 more, and i hope you are HUNGRY because the portion of food is huge!  My friend ordered a wrap, and even that was the biggest wrap i've seen.  Super nice staff.  Chilled casual atmosphere.  Will definately go back!!!"}
{"text":"Very, very clean establishment. However the chicken shawarma tasted like chicken with lime. Rest of the toppings were good but the star of the shawarma was lacking."}
{"text":"Used to go there for lunch often, but portion gets smaller and smaller. Not impressed to my recent order, chicken got overburned on grill."}
{"text":"Highly recommend lunch place! Amazing fresh hot and delicious Lebanese sandwich. The store is clean and food are all made fresh in house. The owner is super friendly and he remembers you.   My favourite is the kafata sandwich! Fresh grilled beef skewer with pickles and humus wrap in pita bread ~ all the juice from the beef and flavour burst out on first bite! Caught me at first bite for the whole year. Even now I don't work in the area, I comeby whenever!   It's not those chain store on the street or in the food courts, it's legit good soul comfort food!   Chicken sharwma with fries, the grilled fish plate, twister potato, hummus and garlic sauce are all so so so good!   Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Fresh takeout! I had chicken shawarma. Could maybe ask more salad and less rice and potatoes next time. The portion size is really good!"}
