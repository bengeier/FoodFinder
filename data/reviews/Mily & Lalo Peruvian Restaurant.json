{"text":"Not to be confused with Lilo and Stitch or Hanna Montana, Mily & Lalo is a charming Peruvian restaurant off Sharon Amity Road.  Our waitress said that their roasted chicken and seafood dishes are all the rage.  We went for the seafood and it was scrumptious.  My wife got a seafood variety in a tomato broth and loved it.  She was picking out crab meat for a good thirty minutes.  I had a creamier sauce over my seafood and were it not for the copious cilantro (more on this later), it would have been fantastic.  We also received delicious lightly fried bread before the main meals with a spicy dipping sauce.  Out of this world.  I would have given Mily & Lalo a 5 star rating were it not for two things - 1.) the men's bathroom (didn't look like it had been cleaned in a while), and B.) cilantro.  Let's talk about cilantro, shall we?  It is an egomaniac.  If there is any other flavor in a dish, cilantro stops by for a visit and says \"you think you have flavor?\" and then you taste nothing else except cilantro.  It really needs a smackdown.  So my advice to restaurants is this: if you're going to put a lot of cilantro in a dish, please let that be known in the menu.   Cilantro - if you're reading this, meet me at the bike rack at 4 today.  We gonna have at it, brutha!  But that's neither here nor here, and so please check this place out.  I think you'll be happy you did.  By the way, Peru is north of Chile, for all you Americans like me who are geographically ignorant (and Chile is on the southwest side of South America)."}
{"text":"I've been there yesterday for lunch. It was pretty quiet at 3 pm. We had ceviche and halea. I was happy with the quality of food. Ceviche was fresh, not rubbery, just tasty and a little spicy. Halea is fried seafood. You know, you can fry whatever and it will be allright, even pickles:)) We think, they have  imitated crabfish in their halea.  They don't make their own tartar sauce, they bring a bottle. On a bright side, food was fresh and tasty, the bread was delicious - it made out yuca flour. And service was friendly and eficient. Place is clean, it's kinda important to me. I think, it's very decent spot and good addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and got the chicken and beef fried rice and the Sudado di mariscos. After reading the great reviews on yelp, I was excited but the food was disappointing at best. The hot pot sauce tasted like salty water and was otherwise flavorless. The fried rice was blackened from the hefty use of soy sauce. Don't think I will be going back to this place."}
{"text":"My wife, grandson and I decided to try some Peruvian at Mily and Lalo's. The yucca bread was very good. My wife ordered the Carapulcra, chicken in Peruvian sauce. She didn't really care for it. My grandson ordered the ceviche de pescado. This was some unidentified fish, chopped up and cold, swimming in lime juice. He didn't like it and when asked if they could substitute something else, the waitress wasn't willing to do anything except just bring another choice and charge for both, we didn't bother. I ordered the aji de gallina, slices in a spicy cream sauce. I really liked it and it wasn't spicy, just as I asked for. The waitress wasn't very good with her english which is a shame because the menu descriptions were very vague and needed some extra explaining. This was our first time in a peruvian restaurant and this likely led to picking foods that turned out not so good. Never had a cold, chopped up fish of doubtful indentity. The sweet tea was good though. Service after the food hit the table was non-existant. One good out of three isn't really that good. I will not be returning, but I can say I've had the Peruvian experience and found it lacking. My wifes food went virtually untouched save for the rice, she ate half. My grandson so didn't like the fish plate, he didn't eat much beyond the sweet potatoe and chunk of corn, though my wife tried it and managed to eat some of it. As I stated, I liked what I had, the sauce was tasty, the potatoes and chicken buried under the sauce was good and the rice was, well, rice. When eating unfamiliar cuisine, we like to talk it over with the staff to get an idea of what we will be getting. Here we were unable to, due to the language barrier. The place does seem to be fairly popular with the latino community however. They are likely more familiar with the food choices and what they would be getting. I only gave three stars because I liked the food that I got, the service only deserves about 2 stars max. Again, we won't be coming back here again. To bad because it's right in the neighborhood and I had higher expectations based on other reviews of  this place."}
{"text":"We drove by it twice trying to find this place but I'm so glad we didn't give up.  Omg the food is incredible.  The staff was awesome and took our order right away. We butchered the names of the meals we ordered but the waitress was really nice about it.  I had the fish with sauté onions and tomatoes.  My boyfriend had the half chicken with fries.  The portion size is pretty big so come with an appetite or plan to bring food home.  I will definitely eat the rest for lunch tomorrow.  I totally recommend this restaurant.  We will be back.  I loved the fish so much I will probably order it again but everything on the menu looked great."}
{"text":"Best place for Peruvian food in charlotte and Mily is a sweet heart,"}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Try the ceviche - so fresh and delicious! Portions of everything are generous and well-priced. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Place was clean.  Price was fair. Waitress was friendly. Food took longer than expected to arrive but it was definitely worth the wait.  Ate a traditional peruvian dish that had a peanut/potato  base with chicken.  Loved the Pan de Yuca bread."}
{"text":"Omigosh! I was so excited to find this hole-in-the-wall Peruvian restaurant and we were not disappointed. They feature Pollo Inka which is Peruvian chicken. This is very similar to the chicken served in other Latino countries which is a whole chicken which is slowly roasted. It comes accompanied with the mystical \"green sauce\" which is savory and spicy. Be daring and try the garlic \"ajillo\" sauce which is quite spicy but which I think really enhances the flavor of meats and starches. Ceviches are served with a small side of corn-nuts. They were not shy with the lime juice which I loved.  All servings are generous in size and very fairly priced. A giant bowl of their version of chicken noodle soup was $7. I asked about their yuca dishes and the server surprised us with fried yuca appetizers on the house. She answered all of questions and didn't hesitate to go check with the back kitchen if she didn't know the answer. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"We tried M&L not even certain that it was open - glad we did! The interior is very nice and our waitress was very pleasant & knows the extensive menu. There are tons of great-sounding seafood choices. We had a couple of the smaller chicken dishes for lunch - they were delicious. We're definitely going back soon to try more things."}
{"text":"The food was good the service friendly & the environment was cozy. I have been here several times and the food is consistently good. The lunch menu has reds able pricing."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to East Charlotte to Mily & Lalo Peruvian Restaurant.   The last time we visited a Peruvian restaurant, we really enjoyed the food, so it was an easy choice to try another one. We weren't disappointed.  Dora here. The empty seats alarmed us, but we visited on Sunday after our early church service, and figured we beat the crowd for lunch.  For starters, all guests receive a complimentary basket of Yuca bread. This bread was great, much like a yeast doughnut without the sweetness, very light and melt in your mouth.  Dora here. Yuca bread? What a surprise! We've eaten Yuca on several occasions and especially enjoy it fried like french fries. Loved it served this way. But see that sauce? Mercy! That fire burns all the way down! Don't dip your bread in that sauce. Phew.  For my meal, I chose the Arroz Con Mariscos, yellow rice with seafood and a blend of spices, sometimes called Peruvian paella. This dish was very good with just the right amount of spice and loaded with seafood. Adding a gravy for moisture would've nudged this dish to great.  Dora here. The Milanesa de Pollo...Yum! The fried chicken breast, tender and moist, takes up plenty of real estate on this plate, doesn't it? I didn't touch the fries, tucked under the chicken, and only nibbled on the rice because I ate every bite of that juicy chicken! Even if they served gravy or butter and brown sugar on their rice like I prefer, I probably would've skipped it in lieu of the chicken. Delish!  All that food (with leftovers!) and the bill was less than $28, including tip. Definitely budget friendly, and the service, attentive and quick.  We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"The food was edible, but service was arguably the worst I've ever had.  I won't be back, at least not to eat inside.  I came in for a late lunch last week after driving by and seeing a cheap lunch special.  It wasn't very specific on what your actual dish was, but I figured I'd try it anyhow.  When we walked inside I noticed this place was basically empty, there were only 2 other tables occupied.  I was in a little bit of a hurry, so I hoped that this would speed things up, but boy was I wrong.  They pointed to a booth for us to sit at and it wasn't too awful long before I was given a menu, but then our server disappeared.  After it taking close to 10 mins to get our drink order, I should have just walked out, but I wanted to try this soup/entree/drink lunch special.  We waited and waited to place our order and finally our server did come back.  There was a little bit of communication problems as our server was speaking Spanish, that normally wouldn't bother me, but she spoke fine English as well, she just refused to.  After placing our order we sat there for quite some time waiting on our food and didn't see our server the whole time, no clue where she was going.  She would occasionally walk by, but never any eye contact.  Eventually we did get our food, but my buddy's steak didn't come with a knife.  He literally had to yell at her for a knife as she would just not pay us any attention.  Any other time in my life I would have been embarrassed, but that is what he had to do to eat.  After completing our meal we finally had to get up and ask for our check.  Our server never once came by to ask how things were.  We had 2 separate checks and we were both paying with $20s.  After 10 mins of her not taking our money I just grabbed both checks and left a $20.  Buying my buddy's lunch was worth more to me than waiting on change at that point.  This lunch had already taken an hour.  FYI, the food wasn't that bad.  Although my lunch special was pretty similar to what you may come across as chicken fried rice at a Chinese place."}
{"text":"Went Saturday with the fam. Food was really good. Including the yuca bread. Yum. Server was nice but it took 15 minutes for us to get attended to.  Their was no chicken no deserts and it was only 5 pm. Kinda was looking forward to trying it. They need more help. I had the Marisco ceviche. It was delicious. If I'm in the area I might try them again and hope that theirs more staff and have more food."}
{"text":"Got here about 7:20 on a Saturday night. Only about 3 other people in here. Waitress is friendly and quick but she's by herself (I guess more help isn't really necessary when it's this empty). Juices are fresh, sodas are canned. Yucca bread is delicious and fresh. Tamals are a good size and really good. Big enough that you will want to share or you may start feeling full. My husband ordered one for each of us. Yikes! I'm pretty full before dinner even comes out. But the main reason for only 2 stars is because when I mentioned Peruvian chicken to my husband, as always he's all for it! Loves it! But..... THEY RAN OUT! How could they run out of chicken? We were pretty disappointed about that since my husband came in with his mind and taste buds set on it. Instead, I got the sirloin with egg (bistec a Lo pobre) and my husband had a chicken dish that had a little bit of chicken with a soup like sauce (Carapulcra). Both were pretty good but I thought the steak was a bit bland and a little chewy (but it was sirloin, so that's to be expected). He finished mine and barely touched his. He said he did not want to take the leftovers home! He left almost a full plate of food which means he was not impressed at all. Not sure if we will be back because I noticed that other reviews mention not having the pollo a la brasa when they came in as well :( that's too bad. Not a bad meal but many disappointing points."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and probably the last one. I came here with my boyfriend and we didn't know if we were suppose to get a table ourselves or wait for the waitress to seat us. There was about 15 people in the restaurant and only one person. This poor lady was doing everything !!!! We waited 25 min for our food and there was nasty long hair in MY FOOD!!!!!! She forgot about my entree and didn't take my dirty dishes off my table. Such a bad experience. Oh and my boyfriend just got a a new plate and there was another hair. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Love this little spot for Peruvian food. It's a little far from where I live but worth it every time!"}
{"text":"What an amazing Peruvian restaurant. First time visit and the food was delicious. The service was excellent. Did I mention the food was delicious? Comparable to authentic Peruvian food I've had in Lima. The restaurant is clean and offers a variety of food, desserts and drinks."}
{"text":"East Charlotte is like the ethnic food/anti chain neighborhood of Charlotte, full of family run restaurants. There are so many I want to try, but just can't get past Mily & Lalo. The house it's located in was a Thai restaurant back in the day, and still retains the ornately carved bar. It's lovely and unique; no sense getting rid of it.   Not for the carbaphobe, this is some heavy food. Some of the plates feature a salad, but it's seems sort of an afterthought or garnish. If you can get past that there is plenty of good eating. The meal always starts with a basket of fried yuca bread which is gluten free! Warm and steamy with a very slight sweet taste and is absolutely delicious. It is served with a spicy salsa that is either a creme de rocato or aji sauce. Dipped everything I could into it to try and figure out what it was made of; requested more when I ran out. Seems to be either heavy cream with chili, lime and maybe a bit of horseradish or mustard. I could do shots of this.   Appetizers are so reasonably priced, why not get two? We always start with the potato and beet salad, probably one of the lighter items. It also includes green beans and peas in a light mayo like dressing. It is a perfect foil to the beef heart kebabs, which are tender yet slightly chewy with a marvelous smoky grilled flavor. It's really good with the previously mentioned chili sauce.  The entrees are enormous. Ceviche is always fresh tasting and tangy with a hint of hot spice. The corn, marinated red onions and sweet potatoes that it is served with provide a nice contrast. There is a steak dish served with eggs, french fries, rice and fried banana's that is massive and filling. The rotisserie chicken is juicy and flavorful and served with plenty of fries. You will not leave hungry.  As for dessert, their rice pudding is simple and yummy, redolent of cinnamon and clove. After missing out on the mazzamorra moradaI finally got there on a day that they had it available. You can order it straight or get it on top of the rice pudding. It was like eating a from a jar of  lightly sweetened room temperature blackberry jam, with a gooey texture and chunks of fruit. Unique and delicious. Next time I will get it on top of the rice pudding, it sounds like a beautiful marriage.  Check it out, the menu has a lot of variety and surely there will be something you will want to try. There are so many dishes I wish to try, so I will return."}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is very nice.  Before the meal they served some kind of fry bread that was delicious.  I ordered breaded chicken with rice, and it was just ok.  My partner ordered a dish that was chicken, diced potatoes, in a sauce that was really good!   I feel this place is ok if you want to experiment, but not so memorable that I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It was just OK. I'd been wanting to try this restaurant for a while because I love Peruvian food. I ordered Lomo Saltado (with chicken, not beef) and there was way too many fries and rice and not enough meat, onions, tomatoes, etc. Flavor was just OK. The servings were huge but mostly due to the portion size of the fries and rice. Maduros were a little overdone and crispy. Also the service was very slow even though it was lunchtime and there were only a few other people there. Paid around $30 for 2 entrees, 2 cans of soda, and a small plate of maduros. I prefer Machu Picchu or Pio Pio."}
{"text":"Omg#! I'm still licking my lips the food was soo good!!!! I most definitely will be returning.  The food was excellent,  very flavorful. And our waitress was very nice. I also loved that the price was reasonable. You can't go wrong here. It's definitely a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"George R. was right when he told me about this place almost nine months ago (even before they had moved to this new location)!  Fantastic!  A new Favorite!!!  The Complementary __   ___- (Bread) - Tasted like Donuts and this Fantastic Spicy Sauce with some Lime Wedges was GREAT!!!  Inca Kola was the Banana flavored Conbonated Drink!  Impressive!!!  5 yelp stars   _____   ____- Beef and Onions with Egg Wrapped in flaky Baked Potato with Red Onions in Lime Juice (I think) Excellent!  I will be getting this again next time...  We'll have to take more people with us!  We saw some of the other tables getting one of these!  Yucca \"Fries\" too salty and still YUMA!!!  These are the best I have tasted so far! 5 stars!  Number 49. Chicken and Beans with Rice (Peruvian Curry? my description) - It was good, not great, yet glad to have tasted it, though would not order it again...  Our Server was very friendly and helpful, made a few suggestions!  They do not serve the \"Pudding\" (Mazzamorra Morada) Dessert every day so if you really want one, call or send a smoke signal or espn or...  In a House!  Probably the safest feeling spot in the neighborhood!  The Decor is kinda Thai House, III meets Machu Picchu, old Thai, New Incan not to mention the Mexican in between!  Did I leave anyone out since 2003?"}
{"text":"As I walked in I was extremely surprised that the interior was definitely not what I expected. Anyways, with the decoration and what not Ill get to the food.  Lets say, majority of the fish and seafood is fried. Even though it looks delicious, those who are looking to be more healthy might want to look towards the meats and things that are not fried.  I ordered: Carapulcra (49) which consisted of a marinated chicken consisted with a dried potato in spices with white rice. I was looking forward to the sauce as this will mark my first Peruvian dish.  My verdict: it was very tasty! There was a good amount of potatoes and it wasn't too bad. It was a little salty, but not to the point where it was unbearable.   I thought the best dish would have been the Pescado a lo Macho. The fish was delicious mixed with the sauce. (we ordered medium heat)  Other dishes ordered were the hockey beef fried rice, and a chicken dish with cream that I can't think of (but it was really good).  *And to note an interesting fact: when the waiter said fried rice in the native tongue of Peru, they actually spoke a little Chinese. The Chinese word for fried rice and their word were the same, if not exactly. This actually amazed us and see that it was very interesting how Peru had some Chinese influence.  Overall, I will come back here to try other dishes. The prices are cheap and it's a nice and quiet place that is unknown to Charlotte. I would recommend this restaurant if a Peruvian taste bud pops up!"}
{"text":"2nd visit, first review: both visits my boyfriend and I were the only patrons but the service was no less attentive and no less friendly. First visit we had a half roasted chicken and Peruvian paella, this visit we had the catapulcra (delicious!) and the lomo saltado de pollo (so amazing I want to eat it every day). Both trips we walked out with plenty of leftovers and a comparatively small dent in our wallet. I can't recommend this place enough. SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"I was in town from Jersey and a friend recommended me to this place. I'm Peruvian so i know the typical dishes and so i had the arroz chaufa mixto (mixed fried rice) and it was delicious, but this was the first time I tried the Yuca bread. I am not much of a fan of Yuca itself, but that yuca bread was awesome. Next time I'm back in town i'll definately be goin back."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here. The plantains were cooked to perfection, the yucca bread that came before the meal was just wonderful and the spicy dip was the perfect accompaniment. I enjoyed everything on my plate (I got the half chicken). I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I don't care what people say. I have a soft spot for Mily y Lalo. I've been there so many times the server knows my order and doesn't even have to ask me what I want. I've had aji de gallina, lomo saltado, anticuchos, leche asada, 1/4 de pollo con ensalada y papas, and a few other things. All were pretty good. So much better than Machu Picchu, yuck! My favorite thing is the bread. Ooooh man, it is so good. They're fried pillows of goodness. Take a piece and dip it in the spicy pink sauce and you'll love it, too.   Service is kind of slow. It's normal for there to be one server for all of the tables. It's never bothered me much. I keep going back. Lunch is kind of hard if you're in a hurry.   It used to be a Thai restaurant and some of the old decor is still there mixed with Peruvian llama wall hangings and traditional music in the background. Don't let the outside of the building fool you."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Peruvian style rotisserie chicken and Mily & Lalo gets it right! The chicken came out hit, flavorful and juicy! Be sure to try the green sauce which has a tangy flavor but compliments the food well. When we 1st arrived, they gave us a bread basket with fried bread similar to donuts without the sugar and a spicy red dipping sauce, yumm. I came on a weeknight after 8 and we were the only customers! Never fear, the service was great and food muy delicioso. Parking is available in front of restaurant"}
{"text":"Went here last summer, and it was a nice cozy place to enjoy Peruvian cuisine for the first time.    I had the Aji de Galina (which is a dish with chicken served creamy sauce on rice that is slightly spicy) and a baked potato with fresh onions (Peruvian style) definitely satisfied my appetite while visiting Charlotte, North Carolina.  I even got to try Inca Kola for the first time which is this sweet yellow soda that was apparently brewed and made by the Ancient Inca Gods themselves in a factory just outside of Lima, Peru."}
{"text":"Meh.  This place was ok.   I appreciated the Peruvian decor inside.   The chicha morada was just right.   The sauce for the Papa a la Huancaina was bland. The sauce did not contain Aji Amarillo in it and it came off as \"Cheese Whiz\" on top of potatoes.   The Aji de Gallina was ok. The sauce was too eggy for my tastes. The potatoes on the bottom needed to be just a tad bit crispy on the outside for an added texture.  The menu needs an overhaul. Menu states that they offer Pepsi products but only Coke products are offered. Confusing a la carte section. Choclo a la carte is only for the \"other smaller corn\" and not the \"Peruvian corn\"."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Milo and Lily and we really loved it! The service was prompt and very friendly and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Okay so whoever said \"fabulous\" has not eaten out much. First all half the menu is only available on the weekend, which seemed to have much better items.  The food we did end up ordering came out one piece at a time leaving one member of our group without food until the end of the meal.  The food was bland and didn't not seem fresh so no one ate much.  The yuca bread was pretty damn good (if there is a silver lining)."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Peruvian spot in Charlotte. Family owned restaurant with authentic cooking. The owner Mily is a sweet lady."}
{"text":"We like to try different places so we thought we'd give this place a chance. I ordered the Aji de Gallia which came out cold. My husband ordered Carapulcra, it was ok. They were out of the appetizer, Tamal, and the rice pudding dessert that we wanted to try."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! You drive into the parking lot and you think eeeeh ... but once inside this place is like walking into a little piece of Peru,  very clean , and as it should have, the ethnic details that bring you back to your home country, even the music is appropiate just the perfect representation of our country's culture, the service is pleasant and friendly, food is the closest to the authentic Peruvian  Food I had in a while (since my mother's cooking) we ordered the papa rellena (potato mushed with seasoned meat in the middle and fried crisp around) and Lomo saltado ( steak ,onions, tomatoes over fried potatoes) delicious!  definitely a little hidden gem. :)"}
{"text":"Came for a Sunday dinner, ordered a whole rotisserie chicken, an order of anticuchcos with a cuzqueña - most authentic Peruvian food I've had since visiting Lima a few years ago. Friendly staff and great ambiance - very affordable (whole chicken for $11)."}
{"text":"After leaving the restaurant, I was pretty dead-set on giving this place a three-star rating.  But as the days passed, Mily & Lalo was on my mind...  I can hear a faint whisper in the air: mi mi mi, ly ly ly... la la la, lo lo lo.  That's when the mescaline was in full effect.  But I had to have it... you see, I was craving the bread.  That delicious world-rockin' yucca bread.  It tastes like a donut.at.its.m-fing.core.  So good.  When you take a bite of it (and dip a piece in the spicy ambrosia-esque sauce), you'll know what I'm talking about.  Some say exaggeratiion reeks of sarcasm, this, my friends - the bread - smells of the truth.  Abandon religion - find the bread.  Ceviche's okay.  dmo out"}
{"text":"They have great lunch specials: good meals including soup and drink. They are cordial and clean. Peaceful atmosphere. It's a keeper for weekday lunch."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised at how tasty the food was after hearing some negative feedback. I got the 1/4 chicken and some fries. This isn't the best Peruvian food but it's cheap and located fairly close to my house. On the occasion my girlfriend and I went we were the only people there. Our server was nice but was very attentive. I would go back again seeing that I was full only spending like $6."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and I'm so happy that I did!  Think this restaurant is fairly new so there were not a lot of people there.  Besides us, there were two other tables, both spanish speaking.  Good sign!  We sat down and they bought out fried dough.  It's equivalent to funnel cakes without the powder sugar.  Was delicious and freshly fried.  I ordered the beef steak that came with rice, two over easy eggs, sweet plantains, french fries, lettuce and tomato.  That was $12.  It was very tasty.  Love the seasoning.  My partner had the 1/2 rotisserie chicken with french fries and a side salad.  That was $9.  He wasn't even hungry when I dragged him in there but he ate like he was ravished.... meaning... it was very delicious.  I had a few pieces and wished I had ordered two entrees instead of just one.  They also bought out a home made hot sauce for dipping.  Chicken was great with it.  The menu is pretty diverse.  There was a huge soup and seafood sections.  While there I saw a guy ordered some type of soup with noodles and it came out in a huge bowl.  Looked really good especially for such a cool day.  I will definitely try the soup next time I'm there.  Menu was reasonably priced.    Atmosphere was OK and food was GREAT.  This will go into one of our regular restaurant rotation.  So excited that I found this place and can't wait to go back with friends."}
