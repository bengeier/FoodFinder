{"text":"This was very disappointing. The online menu was not the same as the menu in the restaurant. The prices were significantly more and there was not much choices in food. Additionally, they got our orders wrong. All in all, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service! We tried their brunch last weekend, amazing food, good value for the price and very nice people. We will definitely go back again. Enjoyed our first visit so much!!"}
{"text":"I didn't like this place. The service was bad! The food tasted as if I was eating from a food court fast food restaurant! The prices are RIDICULOUSLY high. If you care about your money then do your self a favourite and find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Tried out Leyle's as part of a groupon deal and was unimpressed. The online menu was completely different from what was offered in the restaurant. You could overhear almost every patron asking about why the menu was different (and perhaps the unspoken but definitely implied question of why the prices were also doubled on the new updated menu).   A bread basket was offered on the menu as complimentary... and after asking about it, we still didn't get anything. We were never told about the prix fixe special (which included the same items that we had ordered a la carte).   The chicken supreme was tiny and incredibly dry... and for $26, you would expect that at the very least, it would be somewhat moist. My dining partner ordered the chicken kabobs and found it to be completely overcooked and resembled a food court meal... except, a food court meal would have been considered a five star meal in comparison.  No, will definitely not be going back. Unfortunately, nice decor and live music doesn't excuse bumbling service and terrible food."}
{"text":"When a place charges a couple of dollars more for brunch than the Symposium next door, your expectations tend to be a little bit higher.  Expectations met.  Eggs Benedict came with fresh creamy Hollandaise.  Standard breakfast was an ample serving.  Fruit portions were generous.  Hard to imagine anyone leaving hungry or unsatisfied from a brunch here."}
{"text":"Update**** I'm not making false accusations as owner claims.  What do I have to gain??? The bill was not given to us it was held from us by the waitress/ owner's daughter.  If you added gratituity then why lie about it when we returned to ask to clarify the bill? You can't add gratituity to the bill and lie to patrons about it. Thanks for the reply.  Please own up to your mistakes if you want to succeed as an upscale restaurant.  *****  Our experience at Leyle's was absolutely not pleasent.  Don't let the pretty pictures fool you.    We had dinner at this resurant last night and all I can say is that I would not recommend anyone go there.  We will not be returning after what happened.  We were having a nice dinner up until our bill was brought to us.  The ownner's daughter (whom was also our server) read our bill to us verbally.  She did not at any time give us the opportunity to see the reciept ourselves, instead had the bill in her hands the entire time we were paying, we though it was strange but didn't think too much about it.    After we left the restaurant we did some calculating and realized we were overcharged...perhaps gratituity was added?  We went back and the server, again the owner's daughter, said gratituity was not added and we couldn't get the reciept as it was thrown out already.  We insisted and after my friend calculated our food and beverages in front of her showing the total should have been about $9 less than what we paid she went again and \"found\" the reciept.    Lone behold the charge of 15% tip was added, waitress played dumb saying she didn't know even though she looked at the reciept and read it to us so clearly.    The bill was intentionally kept away from us so that we would tip on top of the total with tip already included.  It's sad that they have to resort to these measures to make a little bit more money."}
{"text":"We bought a groupon and this was our first time dining in Leyle's, very nice atmosphere.  We were lucky that we came on a Saturday, since they have live music.  Our server was very friendly and the owner came to greet us too.  Overall server was great.  Food were better than expected, we had their $40 3 courses dinner with surf and turf, and we also ordered a Jambalaya.  The plating was nice, and food was great.  However dessert was very weak, we had the tiramisu that came with the set dinner.  After reading previous review we did carefully check our bill.  It was very clear, no extra gratuity added, and it clearly priced out the groupon and the taxes.  We will come again for dinner if we are able to buy another groupon.  Without the groupon, it is little bit pricy compare to the value. The $40 3 course set dinner value is not bad,  but If they can give more choices  of main courses and desserts to choose from, that will be better."}
{"text":"Sunday, June 7,2015... Had a Groupon and went at 6pm. My friend had a Caesar Salad as an entre and added 4 tiger shrimp to it for $9.00 more for a total of $18.00. Tiger shrimp were small and salad was average (the kind you get anywhere for half the price). I ordered a hamburger which was $18.00. Since I've never paid that much for a hamburger anywhere, I expected it to be delicious. I believe it was frozen because we had to wait so long to be served. It had no flavor. We asked for some bread & butter while we were waiting since most steak & seafood restaurants normally bring this without being asked. We were told that they were so busy the day before that they ran out of bread. I asked why they couldn't stop at a bakery and pick up more before starting their day, especially since they offer a Sunday brunch then dinner. I was told that the bakery where they buy all of their bread was closed on Sundays. Why would an expensive, classy restaurant not get bread elsewhere? I will never return. Too expensive, too slow and tasteless."}
{"text":"This place has truly awful business practices. The food is not worth the a la carte prices, not even close. We came here using a $69 for a 3 course meal for two ($119 value). Incredibly misleading as the Groupon leads you to believe you get to choose items from the menu (which is posted on the Groupon site as well) In reality you are forced to choose from steak, salmon or chicken. The food doesn't even come close to a lower end chain restaurant level (think Applebee's, Jack Astors, Casey's)   Will never return."}
