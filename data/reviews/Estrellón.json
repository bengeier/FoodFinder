{"text":"I was so surprised to see a 3.5/5 stars on Yelp for this place, so I feel compelled to do a review. I've dined here several times and I have had nothing but great experiences. The food is always spot on. I guess you could say it's pricey, but I really don't take that into consideration unless the food is bad, and in this case it isn't. $60 per person is a solid average price, I think. More if you want a lot of drinks.  Wine list is really great. Go for the bottle rather than the glass.  The cake is out of this world. Always. Get. The. Cake.  This is one of the best spots in Madison for a dinner or even a small snack after work during the week. As far as Tory Miller restaurants go, this one is probably second or third best after L'etoile and possibly Graze (maybe a tie)."}
{"text":"Though I generally like Tory Miller joints, Estrellon was a bad experience with pretty bad food. From morning to night, I suggest avoiding.  The start was the highlight: smoked salmon, charred beets, and brie crostinis were all pretty good. The crab ceviche was ok.   All downhill after that. The deviled egg was bland with no seasoning (not even enough salt.) We did not finish a single one of our larger plates. The pork belly was cooked to a crisp and devoid of any fat, making it a dry mess, on top of some nearly inedible mash. As much as we both love pork belly, we left it on the table. The sugar baby and sunshine watermelon was ok but slightly odd flavor. We did not eat it all.  The spare ribs came out 10 minutes after everything else and were dry and tough. We argued about which of us had to endure the last one and decided it was ok to leave it there.   I also tried the espresso one morning. It was some of the worst coffee I have had. I threw it out without drinking, which is highly unlikely me and my love for all coffee!  With so many other good downtown restaurants, there is no need to go to this place. I never will again!"}
{"text":"Six of us dined and took down a fairly large portion of the menu to share. Highlights included tender grilled octopus, the delicious trout, head on shrimp, and well-priced wines by the glass. Service was very good as well. Unfortunately, not all was great. The beef brisket was actually terrible. Extremely salty, very weak chimichurri, and a giant inedible fat cap. Awful. Papas bravas should have a spicy sauce. These came with a pedestrian aioli. At $45, the paella was not worth the price, as it was relatively small, and I didn't taste even a hint of saffron. Brussels sprouts were bitter and very unevenly cooked. They will have to up their game to succeed in such a pricy spot. Hopefully they can pull it together."}
{"text":"I'm torn here.  When we ate here, the food was excellent.  But everything is overpriced.  For a few appetizers and a couple of glasses of wine, our bill was well over $100 and we were still hungry.  If they adjust their prices, I will be back.  Otherwise, I don't think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Food was a bit overdone, and expensive. Nice interior and great service, however."}
{"text":"We tried tonight for the first time with our foreign exchange student from Spain.  We all agreed it was not very authentic.  Everything was cooked with butter rather than olive oil.  There was not a lot of flavor, certainly not the spices of Spain. It was expensive as well.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went opening night with friends.  We decided to embrace the tapas style and order a bunch of small plates and sample a bit of everything.  The food was amazing especially the scallop and paella.  The service was also spot on and our waiter Frank did an amazing job explaining everything we wanted to know about the menu and what to expect from each plate.    We will definatly be back to try more"}
{"text":"Pricey I thought for what we we served. Vegetable paella was sadly missing seasoning including salt. Shame. Sangria must be individually mixed as my first glass was perfect. Second was way, way to strong so I poured half in a tablemate's glass."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to Estrellon, and because there are so many negative reviews on here- I feel obligated to toss in my positive plug to help boost the overall star-rating of Tory Miller's latest restaurant venture.   First of all, tapas-style can be left to many interpretations (I personally respect that the portions are kept small- to encourage trying a few dishes at a time and returning to sample more). American culture is such a game of excess and over-indulgence; Estrellon captures gourmet tapas cuisine and keeps the integrity of small plates intact.   The first crostini offerings we sampled were a delightful creation with sardines and kale, and another with smoked salmon and caviar. We also requested the marinated olives to be delivered with our first glass of wine.   Our server was incredibly warm and ingratiating, and we were surprised to discover towards the end of our meal that it was her first night serving at the restaurant.   After the initial foray into the tapas section of cuisine (and eager for another glass of wine to enjoy while lingering at our kitchen side table), we were inclined to venture over to the backside of the menu, and explore a few of the \"La Cena\" dishes. The brussels sprouts, shisito peppers and honey crisp apples were all absolutely astounding. The simple balance of ingredients within each dish was dignified; an exemplary display of culinary creativity.  Chef himself personally delivered our plates on numerous occasions, and sitting with the open kitchen as our entertainment made for a wonderful and unique dining experience.   Congratulations Tory Miller on another 5-star Madison establishment.  Cheers,  Victoria"}
{"text":"Let down by the James Beard award winner. The atmosphere was very nice unfortunate the food did not live up to it. Starting off I had the small dinner plate of Mussels with white bean red sauce and it literally had no seasoning not even finishing salt. Having been to other \"high quality\" restaurants  not to mention I am of Spanish decent I know Spanish food...I know that it is against the etiquette rules to ask for more seasoning but I had to. The waiter gave me a double take when I did and, of course had to ask the chef for seasoning. It tasted much better with the added seasoning and, I could finish my plate. Within my dinner party of 4, we each had two small dinner plates and one tapa each  and some signature drinks and the food was mediocre at best. We spend $160 and I didn't feel like it was worth it. Not a place I would go back for dinner. Although there is a happy hour special that offers the more traditional Spanish tapas experience, where you order a drink and a complimentary tapas comes with. So that might be a second chance visit someday."}
{"text":"We found a seat at the bar. We had a good time but found it to be a little pricey for what you get.   Pros: Good vibe. Tapas, so lots of interesting options. The basque cake is awesome!  Cons: some of the options were a little on the tiny side. We felt like they would have been better off charging another dollar or two and serving something a couple could share."}
{"text":"This was a highly anticipated visit for my wife's birthday. We love tapas and Spanish food. Furthermore, L'Etoille is one of our favorite special occasion restaurants, and we assumed Miller's Estrellon would be of the same caliber. My wife has been to their morning cafe/bakery, and really enjoyed it. With all that said, Estrellon was a huge disappointment. We started with tapas. I ordered jamon Iberico with tomato jam. The consistency of the ham was different than jamon Iberico I have had in the past. Not bad, just different. However, for $6, you get one laughably small crostini with a smallish amount of ham. My wife ordered the smoked salmon crostini. Same drill: one small crostini with a minimal quantity of topping. The quality of both was average, but at $6 per piece, in MADISON, average doesn't cut it. We ordered a couple of croquetas (fried Spanish bar snacks) at $3 each. Flavors were bland and indistinct, and each croqueta was the size of about half a mozzarella stick. The highlight of the small plates was, ironically, the patatas bravas, fried potatoes in a spicy tomato sauce with aoli. Great flavor, satisfying, and unpretentious. The paella was the biggest disappointment of the evening, at $55 for two people. Three shrimp, a few anemic mussels, and a handful of tiny clams. Heavily salted with little saffron or other flavor. One of the treats of paella is the crunchy bits of rice on the bottom of the pan. However, ALL of the rice in this dish was burned and utterly fused to the bottom of the pan, almost inedible.  The dining room was full when we arrived for our 8:30 reservation. With countless better and more reasonable dining options in Madison, even in the small plate market, I can't imagine it will remain so if they don't step up their game. I know I won't be back until that happens."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch on a weekday and had a delicious brunch. Coffee is from Anodyne and is delicious. We shared a Xuxo croissant, which we agreed was the best pastry we have ever had in our entire lives. The vanilla bean cream filling is amazing. It seemed to be the perfect blend of Spanish pastry style with the sweetness kicked up a notch to satisfy an unfortunately sugar-addicted American palate. :) We also shared the Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon crepe and a chevre and artichoke baguette. Everything was delicious. Service was also top-notch. Definitely going here for brunch again!"}
{"text":"There is potential here for great food, but there is much work to be done.  The flavor profiles are there, but the execution needs work.  I realize we were probably one of the first tables in on opening night, but 20 minutes from seating to server seems a bit much, and then just to be acknowledged. Real service took another 10-15 minutes, and seemed to drag while waiting for the and the kitchen. The couple of tapas plates ordered were small for the price, and the ' Paella for two' was, honestly, a disappointment. Again the flavors were there, but the execution was lacking. \" Traditional crust on the bottom' is only a step removed from ' burned to the pan' The step, in this case, was taken On the up side, the Cocktails at the bar were excellent, and the service there was excellent Bottom line, they need a few weeks to get things polished. I guess our expectations from a James Beard chef were higher."}
{"text":"Estrellón is a tapas-style restaurant, so this means the plates are smaller (read: you need to order more of them!). This is also a pretty nice restaurant, so expect that your meal will cost $60/person (including drinks and tip).  Now that I got that out of the way, the food is incredible. From the Spanish-inspired cocktails to the small plates, large plates, and dessert, it seems everything was crafted with attention to detail. Highly recommend the grilled octopus (large plate) and the basque cake (dessert). Also tried the melon gazpacho, the heirloom tomatoes, and the pork belly. Everything was amazing and I can't wait to try some of the other dishes on the menu.  Some of the dishes (like the pork belly) are a little on the heavier side, which might be a negative for some, but it's a positive for me, so no complaints here! I would also like to add that the service was top-notch. From the host to the waiters, to the kitchen staff, everybody was courteous and helpful, and the food timing was perfect."}
{"text":"Tory Miller's new venue is the perfect place to stop for tapas and drinks before a show at Overture Center. We stopped in early on a Thursday evening and had the bar to ourselves. The bartenders were well informed and extremely friendly! I love that Estrellon, just like Graze offers tap wine at affordable prices. Happy hour is a must! You get a complimentary tapa with each glass of wine purchased! It doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Set within a warm, yet modern space off of Madison's State Street, the Spanish-themed restaurant and wine bar is an instant favorite. Between the extraordinary service, wide selection of wine and cocktails, house-made charcuterie, and beautifully composed dishes, the new 155-seat restaurant is one of Madison's best.  Continuing his reign as one of the leading chefs in the Midwest, Miller turns the tapa experience up to eleven. From small plates to larger selections, the inventive Estrellón delivers with a Wisconsin twist.  Located in a 6,000 square foot space in the new Ovation building near the Overture Center, the restaurant features a large dining room as well as a separate section for a bar and taperia offering pinxtos, ham, cheese, and seafood.  The wine menu features primarily Spanish wineries, and the cocktail program by amazing bar manager Mike Lu offers a variety of classic and original cocktails focusing on fortified wines."}
{"text":"I so wanted to love Estrellon, we loved the space, the open kitchen, and the service, but were disappointed in the pricing and size of the non-tapas cena portions and paella portions. The $14 cena (dinner-not tapas) portion of gulf shrimp = 3 elegantly and minimally prepared shrimp sauteed with shell on, cooked in oil with lemon and salt - just a tad overcooked, not memorable, we shared this, so I got one. I've been spoiled by the paella my cuban aunt made for me. Her paella was large, deep, not greasy and there was always more. It is a spanish comfort food, not a fussy labor intensive dish. The Estrellon paella was good in its own way, but was a bit skimpy on portion size, and a bit pricey for a small skillet of a dish that is mostly rice, $45 serves 2. I dont think you can get great paella in a small skillet with only about one inch deep of rice. It needs to be deeper. I wish my aunt was here to open a spanish restaurant, she would want you to walk away full and happy and would feel guilty if she charged you too much. The best items we had were the sangria (although smallish portion) and the cake baked with cream, both were delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food, wine and service. The portions were exactly what I would expect for a Spanish restaurant, and we certainly did not leave hungry (the Basque Cake dessert is INCREDIBLE!). We've had trouble finding quality Spanish wine where we live but Estrellon's selection blew us away, as did our server's knowledge of the wine. We loved sitting at the bar overlooking the kitchen and wish they were open for brunch so we could be back tomorrow AM! Amazing meal worth every penny and more."}
{"text":"Oof. Such a sad review to write.   I had the highest of hopes for this one. Primarily, the service was right off the street brand new. Like not even established and talented people from their other locations, but just someone who has barely seen the menu, tasted absolutely nothing, seen about 10 dishes come out, and is unaware that wine exists. Food was okay, but we expected better from their predecessors. There was no sommelier on staff, so our unfortunate server kindly offered the most expensive glasses and bottles without any tasting notes. Opting for a glass, I received a generous 2.0oz pour.   Bottom line -- skip it, or wait it out until they get their act together. Service and food is uncharacteristic of the group."}
{"text":"One of the best meals that I have had in my life with truly impeccable flavor combinations (my personal favorite was the honeydew and mozzarella with pesto). Staff was very knowledgeable about plates and were accommodating to a large party. We all left feeling full but not stuffed, and the price was extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of food we received. I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody visiting the Madison area, as the food and experience of sharing each dish made it a night to remember."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this restaurant for awhile. Finally got here a few weeks ago and really enjoyed myself. I was alone and sat at the counter in front of where the chefs work. This was fun, even though they weren't that busy cause it was early. The feel of the place is very elegant w/o being stuffy. Service was friendly and very attentive.  Had the olives and a Negroni cocktail to start,  Then enjoyed a Cauliflower dish( love those veggie offerings!) and a Squid and Potato plate.  I thought the Squid could have used some acid. It was a bit heavy for a summertime menu but after I added some lemon it was good. I ended the evening with an interesting glass of Sherry, which the host came over and talked to me about. Next time I want to do the Vermouth tasting.  I look forward to returning to this restaurant with a group of people so I can taste more of the menu."}
{"text":"Well this was a deeply disappointing experience. I don't know if my jeans and husband's flannel put us outside the target demographic or what.   The service was terrible from beginning to end. We waited at the hostess station for several minutes before being seated. We waited at our seats for several minutes before seeing any of the wait staff. We waited several minutes for drinks.   We were told the kitchen could space out tapas plates, but the dish I asked to start with NEVER appeared. Husband got both of his first and was done eating long before any of mine showed up. We sat and finished our drinks and my \"starter\" has still not appeared.   The irony is we are sitting at the kitchen bar and I can see the dish I ordered getting cold in front of the chef. He must have thrown our the ticket and has no idea where it goes. It's not even steaming anymore.   The food that we did get was good, but there's a lot of good food in Madison - for better prices and with better service."}
{"text":"Love the decor. So beautiful and calming. We sat at the tapas bar before dinner, no need for reservations there. The tortilla, grilled shrimp and tuna all delicious! Our table was taking a while for dinner, so the host bought us a round of tapas, then made sure the rest made it to our table when our table was ready just after ordering.   Dinner: - we had the rabbit paella (not a huge rabbit fan but wanted to try and I was sharing, but the rest was great and I could pick around the rabbit - pan con tomate was delicious! Even if I took a while, it was one of our free tapas, so no complaints - meatballs- were ok, it tasted like too much of the binder maybe bread crumbs - cheese plate was delish - husband had spare ribs and he LOVED them   Service was attentive from the bartender to the host to our server (it was her first serving job!). Looking forward to coming back for more tapas!"}
{"text":"Tapas in Madison! But wait... Great flavors, great service (thanks Christina)  The small plates were small and that's fine though expensive.  The large plates? Ridiculous portions. We got the \"large plate\" of blackened scallops. The only thing that was large was the price. It was literally 3 scallop halves in a great sauce. 1.5 scallops for around $15. $10/scallop.  The $55 paella came with 3 head on prawns that were barely a bite each. Tiny clams with tiny meat. You get the idea. The wine pours were light as well.  Spa Tapas in Madison left us longing for more so we headed to Wisconsin Brewing up State for a couple pints and cheese curds. A very generous serving..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here two times and I'm looking forward to coming back soon.  The restaurant has a comfortable and classy atmosphere and a great location. We arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation and were sat immediately. What a surprise especially for a Saturday night.   We started off with a couple cocktails. I had the \"La Paloma\" and it was equally strong, yet delicious. My friend ordered a daiquiri and the lime flavor was extremely fresh.   We were very hungry and ordered three rounds of tapas. My three favorite dishes that I had the pleasure of consuming were the baked goat cheese, the octopus, and the beet on a crostini. I ended up ordering two beets on the crostini because the flavor combinations were magnificent. It had a smoked goat cheese layer, pickled cubed beets, and pistachio crumbles on top. It was simple, yet delicious."}
{"text":"Having lived in Spain, the menu looked really promising and exciting. I took my boyfriend to try the tapas bar. We had no problem finding a seat near the windows, around 6pm. We were sort of intrigued as to why the host took coats from the dinner guests, but not from those sitting in the tapas area. Our server helped us choose wines that we enjoyed, but the food didn't blow us away. We tried many of the tapas, but the only ones we would order again were the anchovies with kale, jamon and bacalao croquetas, and the cheese curds. Our two small glasses of wine were 12 and 14 dollars, and most tapas were 3-5 bucks. We spent $65 dollars on a \"dinner\" that was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for my husband's 50th birthday. My husband said, \"If I'd known I'd be eating like this at 50, I'd have aged sooner!\" Alex our server was fantastic: Warm, informative, attentive and efficient. The food was out of this world. Such inventive plates that are complex but effortless. The highest quality ingredients, the highest quality preparation. The atmosphere is wonderful: Clean, soft, intimate, luxurious. Chef Tory Miller kills it again!"}
{"text":"Food was disappointing. The tortilla was oily, and underseasoned. Patatas bravas were limp, and squidgy. Tomatoes were delicious (as most tomatoes are in Wisconsin this time of year), but was $11 for 5 or 6 heirloom cherry tomatoes halved, with a flavorless white foam and fingernail sized bread crumbs sprinkled on the plate. The chile nogada with lamb was a thoughtful dish, with good flavor and texture, but it arrived lukewarm, and had lamb bone chips that hadn't been picked out before serving. Marinated olives were very nice, and the croquetas were well executed, but not very interesting, at $3 a pop for a thumb sized dumpling.  Service was also subpar. We asked to get some input on a bottle for the table before the food arrived, the waitress said she'd help, and then disappeared. The food came out fast and furious, still no waitress. Grabbed the maitre d as he passed the table, and he begged off to help finish seating a large group. The rest of our food came out, and still no help from either the waitress or the host. Eventually, the maitre d came back and apologized, and did drop a pour on the table, which was thoughtful. Then, finally, as we're wrapping up, the waitress makes it back to the table and asks \"so would you like to talk about which bottle to get\"? Nope, you're about a half hour too late.  Spanish food, especially the simple stuff like tortilla, leaves zero room to hide execution error. I think it's fair to expect a certain level of service at this price point as well. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I went with two other people after work. We were hungry.  We were unclear on how many dishes to order. I believe we ordered cheese, three tapas, three small plates, two large plates and the rabbit paella.  It was not enough. I then ordered bread to try to fill my stomach.  The food was overall just okay.  The cocktails were good.  The service staff was too attentive.  When you put three bites of food on a plate you better not be trying to clear my plate until is empty."}
{"text":"We dined here this summer with a group of friends, and while I was looking forward to an amazing experience, I don't really feel that we got it. The décor is gorgeous, no lie, but the food was underwhelming. We ordered the paella, and maybe this is normal, but I didn't enjoy having to scrape around the rice that was burnt onto the bottom of the pan. Between the 6 of us, I think we ordered 20 dishes, but ended up going for ice cream later. Maybe that was influenced by the fact that each of us had biked between 25-60 miles that day and were quite hungry. I can see why some people may enjoy this restaurant, but I don't think it's for me."}
{"text":"Went here this last weekend and I have to say I was very excited. We went in knowing for sure we wanted to try Paella as neither one of us had tried it. Went with the Valenciana. YUM. We had some cheese and olives..can't go wrong there. We tried the octopus--it was just ok. We tried a few of the different small plates (one with pears, the other one with charred apples) and they were pretty decent, the Paella just really stuck out here. Was even good the next day warmed up. Also grabbed a piece of cake, to go. It was the dense pound cake and it was phenomenal. When they pressure you to get it, just let it happen and get it. I really just did not like the drinks here. Mine was awful, my partners was awful. The waitress did come through with a perfect wine recommendation when I didn't recognize any of the wines on the menu, though. All in all, I'd go back."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience. Between a few cozy glasses of wine from and extensive wine list to dinner.  The wait staff was friendly and really helped us enjoy the full tapas experience. The charred orange donuts were amazing.   Tori Miller did well here and we can't wait to go back. Sujo wasn't my favorite and Grazed is good but this was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic server.  Wish I remembered his name- he was quite knowledgeable, attentive minus fussiness, and had a great command of their extensive menu.   Food in one word: Adequate. My boyfriend and I came here with paella on our minds- first we split a potato/egg/ham appetizer that was a great portion for sharing, but slightly unbalanced- too much runny egg, not enough ham, and potatoes were undercooked.  Next came the paella.  We ordered the Valenciana to split (roasted rabbit, shrimp, mussels, clams, chorizo, cherry tomatoes, SarVecchio, bomba rice, aioli $45) It was beautiful, but, I hate to say it, rather flavorless.  It didn't have that deliciously delicate saffron taste one finds in really good paella or really any spice/garlic/salt flavor to speak of.  It tasted like rice and meat. The other thing I wasn't too keen on was the chorizo used- it was overcooked to the point of being somewhat rubbery, yet still crispy- a possibility I didn't know existed prior to dining at Estrellon. The aioli, which I thought I'd mix in to my portion to amp up the flavor, was bizarre- again, no flavor (tasted almost exactly like cream?!) and really gloppy/runny.    As for the decor- the dining room is palatial, sure, but the art on the walls is rather offputting.  I think they were going for a cheeky Spanish pop-art kind of thing- but it didn't fit and seemed like something I'd pick up at TJ Maxx. Not a big deal obviously, but it exemplified the general tone of the whole experience- which is: this could be really great, but something's just not right."}
{"text":"Sad to knock this down a star, but I haven't found myself wanting to go to estrellon lately. My favorite dish, the octopus, has gone up from $14 to $18 dollars and I had trouble with getting the servers attention a couple times. I'd still recommend people go in for a drink and the Basque cake, though."}
{"text":"I admit my expectations were high. I'm a fan of Tory Miller's food, and expected another fantastic experience here.  We arrived a bit early for our reservation, so we decided to grab a drink at the bar. I had the wine/cola cocktail, which was fine. My wife, who doesn't drink, ordered the honeydew melon shrub. She's a big fan of the vinegar-y tang of a shrub, and was thrilled that the bar served them. The shrub arrived as a sugar bomb, more syrup than vinegar. After a conversation about it with the bartender, we learned that they sweetened it up after feedback from guests that if was too vinegar-y, and that he agreed with us on what a shrub should be, and would make us a proper one. The second shrub arrived still very sweet. My wife didn't finish it, and we just went for our table, defeated. That shrub sat full on our table all night.  The dining room was about half-full, which seemed odd for 8:30 on a Saturday night. I was expecting the place to be packed.  After reviewing the menu, we decided on splitting the Valenciana paella, and sharing a couple of starters. We ordered the wrapped dates and the deviled eggs. The dates were good, though showed off more of the feta and oil than the date and jamon. Still serviceable but bland. The deviled eggs featured a nice and unexpected olive note, but could have used a bit more salt.  Oh how I regretted wishing for more salt...  The paella arrived and was visually as colorful as you'd expect it to be. You are given a large fork and spoon, and urged to mix up the paella before serving yourself.  ... Which reminds me. I really enjoyed the table side paella dishing at the old La Paella on Fish Hatchery Road. Now THAT was a fun paella place.  Anyway, the first bite of the paella foretold the salt bomb that was to come. The sausage in the paella was already very salty, and whoever made this dish must have either forgot about the sausage, or forget he had already salted paella twice already. Like, salty.  If there was any saffron in the dish, it died a meaningless death.  I let the server know, and he said that he'd pass on the feedback, that the chef is always looking for feedback.  I suppose that's all the server can do with a dish that would take 30 minutes to remake.  The service, btw, was very good.  Also, there was an unopened mussel in the paella.  We didn't finish it.  I think Estrella can use more QA on the paella.  Make sure the bivalves are cooked (they open up for you, guys) and check the flavor before serving.  I can't recommend at the prices they are charging."}
{"text":"The waiter was extremely knowledgable about the food and the wine list. All of the food was good. Only complaint would be the portion size for the price. Try the octopus!"}
{"text":"I could not be more disappointed with Estrellón. If you enjoy paying $1 per shishito pepper or $.50 per white bean, then this is your place.  Besides the absurdity of menu prices (come full, don't eat, leave almost as full because WTF), the food can consider itself mediocre at best. It's not at all in league with similarly priced places in Madison (especially those places that charge this ridiculous amount for nearly no food on a plate WHICH IS NONE) and not worth your time. Please. Not. Worth. Your. Time.  We literally laughed as the plates came to our table.   Decor could be considered \"fancy joke hahah.\"  It was also nice when we were trying to be sold on the most expensive glass of wine in the restaurant that our waitress wouldn't even tell us about."}
{"text":"Some friends of mine are in love with the food here and have been five times. They love it and had set me up to expect an amazing experience.  All of the dishes I had seemed to be missing something. They were ok but missing the big flavor I was hoping for.  The grilled octopus was very well prepared and had good flavor and the carrots were good - get this if you're going. The roasted chicken was bad - skin wasn't crispy, sauce was bland, and it was just kind of slimy.  Service was good. Atmosphere is not my style but it's fine. Overall, its very expensive for food that's just ok."}
{"text":"i must have made a wrong turn. Was I in Valencia? This has to be the West Village. Ah, maybe I'm in Donostia.    Looking for a place to eat at 10:30 PM on a Friday, restaurants were either closed or packed to the gills. As a last resort, we stuck our heads in Estrellon and were told the bar had a late night menu.  Wow, what an interesting, eclectic menu it was. Small plates, tapas, pinxtos, whatever you call them, were delicious and so damn interesting.  This wasn't my Madison student hangout of lore.  Estrellon was grown up, sophisticated, and continental.   The bartender was amazing, recommending wine, dishes, and accommodating our needs.  We stayed late enough to interact with the staff, and they were wise to the restaurant world.  Our discussions of Michelin starred kitchens around the world let me know, \"they knew their stuff.\" The only discordant note was the music.  Estrellon deserves more than the techno crap being played. I expected something like gypsy guitar, flamenco, or an Icelandic ephereal tune.  I can't wait to get back to Madison and try Estrellon's Mother ship."}
{"text":"What once was a five star rating has now slowly declined to an average experience. In the past three times that I have visited, errors were numerous. It seemed like staff were less interested in amending issues. Quality of food and presentation seems very dependent on whether or not Tory Miller is in the kitchen that evening.   The menu has been shortened and simplified in the past few months. There are some veteran dishes and some that rotate. We regularly enjoy the goat cheese and some of the pintxos. One of the popular dishes here is the grilled octopus. It was so simple but so good; tender, warm, served with potatos, paprika, olive oil, and salt. Once one of my favorites. My past visits have included issues of the meat being under cooked  or the dish being extra salty.  The restaurant has been around too long to have issues like these.   The desserts remain strong. Basque cake is still a must and something that all the guests that I take to Estrellon die for.  The service remains a strong element of the experience. Staff on the whole are courteous and prompt, with exception to the issue noted above..   Still a good dining experience, but, some of the original luster that I associatied with Estrellon has worn thin."}
{"text":"Estrellon had a great atmosphere with high ceilings, dark wood, marble tables, open arched kitchen and a most beautiful flower arrangement that recalled the still life paintings of the Dutch masters. Five plus (out of five) for looking amazing!    Sadly, with one stellar exception, the food did not wow. The Basque cake is the best cake I have had in my life, and beat out desserts I have had in many fine linen tablecloth restaurants in New York, Chicago, or D.C.  Excellent, but unfortunately an outlier.    The tapas were just OK. Octopus (with potatoes) was tender... as promised by the waitstaff... but greasy. Pork tenderloin was tepidly flavored and dry. Pintxos were $4 per crustini... and the flavors were pretty basic. I don't mind paying to be blown away with culinary combinations...but cheese and diced beets on a single piece of bread was pretty uninspiring to this diner.      I can recommend the baked goat cheese... the spicy tomato sauce and goat cheese combo was flavorful and a tapas basic that should be good (and was).     The hostess admitted it was her second day on the job... but was very friendly and enthusiastic. We were greeted warmly. The waitress was prompt and did her job in a timely and accurate fashion, but the overall effect was a bit off-putting. She was not out-right rude, but her tone & body language hoovered somewhere between and \" I'd rather be somewhere else\" and snobby.      Would I go again? Maybe. But mainly for dessert and atmosphere... while hoping for a friendlier waitstaff. The fact that empty tables sat open throughout our meal on a Saturday night in downtown Madison was telling.  There are just so many great options in Madison and Chicago that tepid-tasting tapas (even in a stunning visual setting) were not a strong enough contender to fill this place on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Great place for a fancy date or for students with parents footing the bill.  Wonderful inventive mix of flavors and lots of menu options. Save room for the crave-worthy Basque cake for dessert.  Paella would be better if the rice wasn't so stuck to the bottom that it's difficult to eat. (I know it's supposed to be a play on bibimbap, but it does not work with this pan).  Also, Chef, *please* extend the time you clean/soak your clams/oysters! I have gotten sandy bites of cooked shellfish at: L'Etoile, Sujeo and Estrellon. Otherwise it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"For my first tapas experience, I was pretty impressed. Many people complain that the food is over-priced and they are right it is expensive. However, it's an upscale place. You shouldn't expect it to be cheap. It is on the expensive side so this place is definitely for a special occasion. I just had my Valentines dinner here with my boyfriend. We loved that they still took reservations-that's becoming rare these days. The service was excellent, we never had an empty glass of water and the waitress let us sample the wine before we chose. She took us through recommendations of how many plates to order-being that it was our first time there. The tapas are really only for one person.. so we tried to split the two between the both of us- but it was kind of disappointing the size. We ended up ordering the Paella which was totally worth it, all the ingredients were very fresh and everything was delicious. But before that we decided the tapas weren't enough to hold us over for the 20-30 min wait it takes the paella to make. We ordered the meatballs as well and that was a little more filling. So I would recommend that you order a plate off the dinner menu and then the paella if you're feeling that.  I definitely want to come back here to try the rest of the plates off the \"la cena\" menu."}
{"text":"Before i came to Estrellon, i was interested to see why they only had a 3.5 star yelp average ( 2-27-2017). Being an avid yelper, this seemed a little off because they appear very high end from an outsiders perspective. I read many of my peer's reviews prior to coming and most had to do with cost of food/proportion and bad service experiences.   I came here with a group of seven on Saturday night. My conclusion after dining there...I can  understand why someone would write those things, but you also need to have the right expectation coming to Estrellon.  First, this is a small plate style restaurant. If you want to leave with a full belly, you came to the wrong place or you need to spend at least $100 per person. That is just the way it is. You are there to sample, many fine foods...not dig in. I do think it would have added much value to our dining experience if they could have added a single serving more to each small plate. (Ex: one more shrimp or scallop). Just a little more. My favorites of the night were the shrimp, scallops and brisket small plates. Other favorites among my group, were the olives as an app and the paella as a large plate.   Secondly, i am also in the middle of the road on service. They were extremely considerate about my food allergies and my host (my boyfriends father) asked to meet Tory Miller himself, and they accommodated! It meant so much to him, he is a huge fan. In addition, they really  allowed us to leisurely eat our meal. We were there for many hours without feeling rushed.  On the flip side, my boyfriends dad had troubles making reservations for us.He tried through open table, which only allows a reservation up to 6. Secondly, he called and left a voicemail, and no one returned it and lastly he called again and when he did, they said they had his reservation (no one had confirmed it). I feel like that is a lot of effort for him to put in, especially with how generous he was in paying for a high end meal for us all. Lastly, our waitress was great, but if she had been around a little more, i know we would have ordered more food.   Based on the mix i have described from my evening, i am giving Estrellon a four star rating. This makes me sad, because i know they are trying to be a five star dining experience...and right now i am not feeling that is what i had last night. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my meal. It was a great experience. However, If i was looking for another high end/small plate dining experience, i would most likely try somewhere new, closer to the square then return at this point in time."}
{"text":"The food was pretty delicious, but my rating is based mostly on service in the tapas bar. I realize this is a new establishment, but this is why service is even more crucial.  Upon entering, we found our own seats. It was a good 10-15 minutes of us walking back and forth to the bar, looking around for answers, and perusing through the sampled tapas ourselves before anyone even decided to come help us. This is also after watching 4-5 different staff members walk by us without any acknowledgment. The woman that was clearing our table didn't even tell us how the bar worked. We finally tried to order at the bar and at that point, someone finally came over. Then another waiter came over, unaware that we were finally taken care of.  Once we were finally helped, they provided no knowledgeable understanding of the menu, except what was and wasn't popular or good. Food items were not explained very well, nor were the waiters sure of details (i.e. how much do we get, what are these ingredients, etc...).  The weirdest part was when an order of cheese curds came to our table and we informed him that we didn't order them. Instead of figuring out what happened, he just walked away and left them. Granted, we still ate it (and it turns out it was delicious), but that was strange that we ate someone else's order. This confusion continued as many other wait staff (actually, not even sure if they were wait staff) kept coming around asking us if we received dishes that we didn't order.   The ambiance was nice and classy and the food itself was delectable. However, paying $5 for one tiny piece did not seem worth the hassle.   Food was creative but pricey, and the service was not impressive at all, especially for a high-end restaurant. Basically, they need to get their shit together.  It was nice to try, but I likely won't be interested in going back."}
{"text":"I haven't had this good of a brunch in a long time!  The Xoxu crossant was amazing.   My daughter had a chocolate crepe, delicious!   They have fresh squeezed orange juice that was very good!  Nice variety of baguette sandwiches, very traditional.   Reminded me of Europe.   The service was spot on!  We will definitely be back!  I can't wait to try out the restaurant side for a date night dinner!"}
{"text":"Here I am, back in Madison, and what's one of the first things I wanted to do? Head to my favorite restaurant, the IHOP next to Whole Foods! What's one of the first things I actually did? Show some impulse control and head over to \"Estrellion,\" a new Tapas bar that opened up, overseen by the same executive chef responsible for Graze and L'Etoile.  The external decor of Estrellion is uninviting, to say the least. Steel-enforced silver building that houses all the new insta-condos/offices that are popping up all over Madison and everywhere else. The inside is dope, though, and really spacious and gourgeous (sp?). You look like you are on the set of \"The Mask of Zorro\"! I used to be really hostile to fancy internal decor because I didn't like the $5 or so in \"hidden costs\" it adds to the menu items, but more recently, I've grown to think that existential experience can really add that extra bang to a meal. You can take Estrellion to the Swank Bank. Book it.  The food is awesome. I had pork shoulder, crab ceviche (my friend Paul K. ordered it, but I had some), cheese curds, sausage, and pork ribs/chops. They were all good, though don't expect fried bar-type curds. This was a little too \"fine diney\" for me. I also thought the P2P (price-to-portions) ratio on the pork ribs/chops was too skimpy. We're talking like $5 per half dollar-sized chop here. The chocolate dipped churros for desert are great. The only upside to P2P for the entrees is that the meal does not make you feel bloated, and as somebody whose svelte figure is now in constant jeopardy due to my dining habit, this is a big concern to me.  I don't drink, but if you do, be sure to check out one curiosity on the menu: the vermouth flight. A pure vermouth drink. This is hardcore, and our very friendly server said she'd never sold one. I ordered it but then did a \"j/k\" right before she wrote it down. You're talking to a guy who got drunk on a Mike's Hard Lemonade in college and is terrified of alcohol, so no way was I going to do that."}
{"text":"Had a great time sitting at the bar here last night. We came hungry and made a meal of tapas washed down with a couple of bottles of Spanish wine. The food was great especially the boquerones fritos and the chorizo. Was expecting it to be more expensive than it was."}
{"text":"Another average Tory Miller creation that hits a few good notes, but misses overall. I was under the impression that this was a Spanish restaurant, but it was more of a \"food from predominantly Spanish speaking countries\" restaurant. The Valenciana paella was solid - reminded me of Spain when I was an exchange student there. Other dishes were fresh, but simple. Most customers dressed up to pay a price that was not in line with the food. The atmosphere was quiet, and service was good."}
{"text":"Overall experience was fantastic and the food was great as well!  We ordered the following:  Appetizer (2): Tortilla Española, egg, potato, onion, aioli   Baked Goat Cheese, spicy marinara, baguette   Main Course: Valenciana: roasted chicken, shrimp, clams, mussels, chorizo, saffron, tomatoes, aioli, bomba rice   The Valencia takes about 45 minutes to cook and will easily feed 3 people if you order an appetizer as well.    The food really beat my expectations and I already came in with high expectations as I'm a big fan of Chef Tory Miller's other restaurants in town.  Also at the dinner was someone who studied abroad in Spain and she also agreed that the overall experience was fantastic.    If you are looking for an excellent night out on the town with some nice dining in Madison, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went in for dessert on a Saturday.  Basque cake was exceptional.   Great bar for dining. With Krys Wachoiak managing we were made to feel very welcome.    Saw some critical reviews but the décor is very nice - comfortable, with two bars where one can dine, high ceilings giving a very open feel, and acoustic ceiling panels that deaden the noise so one can carry on a conversation.   Drinks we were good - brandy flight was excellent. Mike and the Big Guy behind the bar were friendly and well versed in the menu and the extensive wine list. Tapas looked great and I tried the chicken liver which was unique and also excellent.    Seems like the kind of place where you can spend as much as you like, which is nice.   And we were pleasantly surprised to find the menu is VERY vegetarian friendly. Of the tapas, half were veggies, and that is more options than any place else we could think of in Madtown that is not specifically vegetarian.   We look forward to going back for dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and the only time and space available was the kitchen table, amazing experience was able to chat with chefs and see what they were making and items on the menu before ordering  Service was top notch, very informative and pleasant and they were able to get us out before the theater started highly recommended and would go again."}
{"text":"We Love great Spanish food and have been in search of a good Paella for the longest time and found it here.  I can't believe they've been open two years and I haven't made it here until now.    They were so accommodating as we had our mom with us and she a bit limited in her mobility and had a table waiting right near the door but Mom wanted the window and they effortlessly adjusted for us.  We had the hand pulled mozzarella appetizer and it was really tasty and a most unique dish.  the breadcrumb toasted cauliflower was a very tasty accent. I would definitely order it again.  The Valencia paella was so perfectly done.  I've had Paella in Spain and seek it out wherever i can find it but so many places just cant get it right. If it doesn't have soccarat to me its not paella its seafood with rice.  So many restaurants won't make it authentically as they say they get complaints that it is burnt.  Good Paella isn't burnt but it is the carmelization of the rice from the evaporation of the cooking liquid infused with Saffron that gives the dish its unique character flavor and texture to the Bomba rice.  This is the best I've had outside of Spain and was as good as many that I've tried there.  They take a Chicken and Chorizo sausage base and add some top shelf seafood.  Ours had PEI mussels some incredibly tender clams as well as three perfectly cooked (ie not over cooked) extremely sweet Gulf shrimp plus some very sweet cherry tomatoes.  The unique twist and accent that Chef Tory Miller has added to this is several dollops of house made Garlic Aoli which integrated wonderfully into the dish and added a nice flavor to the dish.  Also they have some very nice wines by the glass at a level that I'm only used to being able to buy by the bottle which is wonderful when you can only have a glass or two.  I had a very full body 2015 embruix de Val Llach from the Priorat region that was stellar.    It was worth the trip from Milwaukee and we will be back again.   It was an amazing dining experience.    I've seen in a few other reviews people have complained about the service.  Ours was excellent.   There whenever we needed someone but yet very non intrusive which is another piece of this truly authentic spanish dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time here, delicious food, very friendly and helpful staff, good atmosphere. It was our first time there and we were not disappointed.  It is pricey as others mention, but not over expensive given the service and quality of food.  Everything was delicious, but Basque cake was the best, Will go again, and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here during the CrossFit Games and had an excellent meal. The food was delicious, and the wine service was also excellent. I appreciate when places do the little things to make the wine perfect, such as paying attention to temperature and glassware. Will go back here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The bar manager is very knowledgeable and creative. Good wine list and overall value. The tapas are heavier (more olive oil) than I have had in other tapas bars but overall very good."}
{"text":"We tried Estrellon with another couple last weekend. The decor is nice, our server friendly and knowledgeable. This is a place you want to take a date to impress.  The wine list is pretty extensive. There were a number of interesting cocktails to try. There were a few beers but nothing impressive. The menu had some expensive paellas and a number of tapas (small dishes). Between the four of us, we tried around a dozen tapas dishes. Some of them, like the brisket and the polpo were just amazing. So tender and flavorful. We devoured them. Many were creative such as the tempura anchovies, and the brueshetta. Some like the charcuterie and the bacon-wrapped dates were delicious albeit not particularly interesting. A few weren't particularly popular at our table such as the roasted vegetables. It's definitely fun to try a wide variety and share with friends.  This is not an inexpensive dinner, but it's worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"Estrellon is another new small plates/Tapas addition to downtown Madison.   There are two sections in the restaurant, you can do Tapas in the bar/Tapas section or do the La cena menu in the dining room (reservations needed).  It's a very nicely decorated, elegant venue with high ceiling, yet it feels very welcoming. The atmosphere is greatly appetizing.  Perhaps we looked pretty young among the other diners there, we waited for I believe 15 min before someone noticed that our glasses are empty. It happens a lot when we go out to fancyish places.   We were given the Tapas menu and the la cena menu. Both had interesting ideas and serve a different purpose. Most of the items on the tapas menu come on a crostini, and it's really just \"one\" bite. They also serve a variety of cheese and charcuterie. So be aware of the price and the proportions.   The la cena menu is essentially another tapas menu with bigger portions. They have several interesting greens options (see dragon tongue). We ordered 4 plates: the mushrooms, albondigas, beef brisket and the dragon tongue. All were some somewhat well executed and come in good portions.   It's a very reasonably priced tapas restaurant that I will definitely come back. Wide selections of wine as well."}
{"text":"This really is a beautiful restaurant. I visited a few months ago, so in this review I will only highlight the things that I still recall. The dining room is elegant and bustling with customers and staff. They offer a tapas menu and a larger plates menu. For tapas, the blood sausage and the sweet potato hummus were the top contenders. All the tapas seem to be served on crostinis, so do not let that catch you by surprise. For dinner, the seared rainbow trout was the chosen favorite at the table. The albondigas fell short on flavor and texture. The basque cake was recommended by our server and this is now one of my top favorite desserts. I plan on visiting the cafe soon. I've heard great things about the pastries and I'm hoping to try those xoxos."}
{"text":"Ordered the paella and they forgot the chicken and another ingredient.  They did take $5 off but it was a $55 dinner.  The rice was not caramelized but rather burnt.  Our server was great for a big party.  Was highly disappointed in the way the food tasted.  May give it another shot as Graze is one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place for a special occasion. As others have mentioned, a bit of a higher end tapas restaurant. The more the merrier so that you can try as many different plates as possible! The service was excellent and we enjoyed most of our dishes. Our dinner was topped off with a scrumptious dessert - I think they called it a Basque cake. Crispy on the outside and milky on the inside with ice cream and a generous serving of berries.  Plates we enjoyed - deviled eggs - brussel sprouts - wild sockeye salmon - albondigas"}
{"text":"This place is seriously good. Came here for my mom's birthday and were welcomed by pleasant and comfortable decor. We were seated at a table by the window which was great.  The wine menu is extensive (appropriately so for tapas) and the server seemed to have a decent knowledge of it - luckily we knew we wanted the alvarinho immediately.   I ordered the manchego to start as it is my favorite cheese. $3 won't get you a lot but about what you would expect from a restaurant for the price. Additionally, we ordered the Wild Hen of the Woods (mushrooms, SarVecchio frico, Dijon vinaigrette, egg yolk), Charred Honeycrisp Apples (speck ham, sherry, Manchego, watercress, hickory nut), Albondigas (meatballs with saffron, tomato, Marcona almonds), Rainbow Trout Grenobloise (delicata squash, ground cherries, cider, brown butter), Roasted chicken with green sauce, and olive rosemary bread. All was very good - though small even by tapas standards - but the one that stood out most to me was the trout and the apples. They were to die for. For dessert, we ordered Creme Catalana (a less viscous creme brûlée) and two drinking chocolates.  Overall, this place was delicious but not true tapas. Of course I get that Tory Miller put his spin on Spanish small plates but if you are looking for traditional tapas...don't expect it from here. I also wish that the portions were slightly larger or the prices slightly lower. Almost a perfect 5."}
{"text":"Checked this place out with two others, and I think they both liked it more than I did.  I'm actually interested in going back to try more, but some things didn't really work for me on first visit.  There is no denying that Estrellón is gorgeous.  A truly beautiful space, with incredible woodwork and rustic chandeliers.  And while the flow of the space does feel rather disjointed, it all somehow works.  While the restrooms were nice, modern and clean, they are too small considering the size of the restaurant.  The cozy bar/cafe area has me curious, so I'm looking forward to going back and checking that out.  They serve breakfast in that area, with croissants and crepes available.  And the food:  Smoked Sockeye salmon, Greek yogurt, caviar, truffle honey - Quite tasty and rich.  I'd order again.  A complimentary order of Marinated Olives left us pleased enough, but could have used more variety.  A Manchego croquette was quite good, and I'd order it again.  Slow-roasted beef brisket, chimmichurri sauce - Dissapointing.  While it seemed nicely cooked, it was lacking in flavor and arrived cold.  Perhaps that's what they are going for, but I prefer my proteins to be delivered hot.  Otherwise I wonder if it's been sitting unnoticed by a server somewhere, with bacterial count rapidly increasing.  Roasted potatoes, rotisserie drippings, sherry vinegar - fantastic, perfectly cooked.  Really delicious.  Dragon tongue, green, & wax beans, crème fraîche, mint, lemon zest - Possibly the tastiest thing we tried.  Delicious.  Rabbit Rilletes - This was my least favorite.  Everything I enjoy about rabbit was missing.  It tasted smoky, somewhat spicy and strange.  Wouldn't order it again.  Wild Hen of the Woods mushrooms, SarVecchio frico, Dijon vinaigrette, egg yolk - Delicious and fun to eat.  All the flavors blended together with the stir of the egg yolk.  I'd order this again and again.  My two companions ordered oysters, which they struggled to finish.  They described the oysters as being over-seasoned and having an odd, overpowering flavor of lime.  Staff members were friendly and service was adequate.  Prices weren't that crazy, but I'd recommend going with a group and having a few $20s in your pocket.  Overall, not too shabby.  Looking forward to going back and trying some more."}
{"text":"Ate here with my aunt and uncle as part of a xmas gift to spend time with them while home for 2 weeks on leave from San Diego. I had tried only 1 other Tapas venue before in SD about a year ago or more and it was an amazing concept to get exposed to. When I heard I had a chance to see how Madison, WI measured up I was game!   The 3 of us came in at about 5pm and ordered from the Tapas bar area where the HH specials are available till 6pm. We must have gotten 8-9 tapas plates in our time there and all of them were great....I cant even remember them all by name! You get 1 free with every drink you get off the HH menu.   Then we moved to the dining room bar area where you can see the kitchen whip of the magic in front of you. We got a few more tapas there and some medium plates as well. We also got the veggies Pealla as it sounded awesome and whats a Spanish venue without some Pealla?  All our dishes were astounding! The plates are just enough to get a bite or two and savor the flavors, textures and food items. Cheese, meat, oil and herb combo magic!   Our paella was bomb also. For not having meat in it as I had last had with jumbo shrimp and mussels, this held up well. We were unable to finish it all it we had had so many tastes of the tapas before!   We spent a good 2 hours here and you should to. Dont rush this experience. Tapas venues are meant to be an experience, a interaction and exposure to new food served in new ways. Estrollen does this well by infusing WI goods into a Spanish small plate concept.   I will have to see if San Diego still holds up with its local Tapas hot spots now!"}
{"text":"VERY disappointing. My partner and I had a lovely meal there last summer and this time it was TERRIBLE. The food and service were both UNACCEPTABLE. The paella was burnt to an inedible ash-tasting MESS. Our wait-person didn't understand our order and NEVER ONCE asked how the meal was. The cocktails are served in what has to be shot-sized martini glasses and the bar-maid said they didn't serve ANY white wine by the glass except for DRY whites. But LOW and BEHOLD they had $80.00 bottles of Reisling on the wine list at the table. NEVER going back again. BUH BYE!"}
{"text":"I'm still glowing from the feast I had recently at Estrellon. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the decor was interesting. The restaurant has two sides, a bar/cafe which I definitely will go back to check out, and the restaurant. In the true spirit of tapas, our group ordered a plethora of plates from the menu, and each one came with pleasant surprises of unique ingredients that I rarely experience at other restaurants. Highlights for us were the Wild Hen of the Wood mushrooms, and the rabbit which came exquisitely cooked. We also loved our first experience with the dragon tongue beans which came in a mint lemon zest that really highlighted their flavors. The biggest impression the restaurant made on us was the seasoning, as all of the flavors were unique, sophisticated and lasting without being heavy-handed."}
{"text":"Went again last night at 7 pm with four other people, spent $270 total. Went out to eat with others less than 4 hours later because we were all hungry. I get they are small servings, and I understand the concept of a tapas restaurant. But let's be clear: The cheeseboard with 3 small dapples each the size of dice for $12 is an inside joke on the customer.   I appreciate Great restaurants, but will go to La toile or Harvest or Tornado from now on, or buy $200 of the finest items at Whole Foods. This was disappointing, and a feeling we left with before...all but the first time we went when portions were small, but not minuscule.   Won't be here again, after 5 tries."}
{"text":"Estrellon is a great restaurant for special occasions or if you want to go out to a nice dinner. It is a bit on the pricier side, especially if you order a bottle of wine or drinks. The food is tapas style, so guests order 2-4 dishes per person. My date and I ordered one small bite, one appetizer (baked goat cheese--which was probably our favorite), two vegetable large plates, and two protein large plates. The roasted chicken was a bit overwhelming. I loved the vegetable dishes. They're not very large but they're all nicely prepared and very tasty! I recommend the Kohlrabi. My date got the lamb shank which he said was delicious.  We sat next to the large window that faced Johnson street. It was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I went last night and I liked what I ate a lot.  I had the Huevos Lucia, the albondigas (meatballs), and a couple croquetas.  I lived in Spain for 5 years and I think the egg dish was probably the most like what I'd encounter over there.  Pretty heavy, good stuff.  The meatballs had more of an herby flavor than I'm used to, but I thought that was an improvement.  The croquetas were probably the best I've ever had, or at least the texture was the best.  Maybe it was battered instead of breaded... however it was prepared though, I approve.  My service was quite prompt and friendly too.  I plan to return some time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Madison.   The sleek, gorgeous, and timelessly sophistical atmosphere takes you to an evening in the Spanish countryside. An expertly prepared paella is done \"just right\" with a fried crispy bottom and a delicious top. Fresh seafood is cooked to perfection and added in for a burst of flavor. Not for the faint of heart, the taste palette of each delicious item will leave you speechless.   I truly enjoy every minute of my experience at this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"I was in town for a work trip, so I brought along my fiance and we tried this on a recommendation for a late dinner.  I have to say, I was quite impressed with several aspects of the place.  First, the service was phenomenal - we got there a few minutes before the kitchen closed (unbeknownst to us - we really aren't those people) and instead of allowing us to say sorry about that and turn away, they sat us just like it was prime dinner rush.  My fiance has an allium allergy, which can be quite limiting, but the chefs worked up some delicious items for her, and for me to share with her.  The Brussel sprouts and the refried sweet potatoes were great.  The wine was also very good with knowledgeable servers on each aspect of the offerings and great recommendations.  This is not a place for the very hungry, however.  The protein offerings were quite small (I get it, tapas place), so you need a few menu items to satiate any sort of hunger pangs.  I almost wish I could bring in my own protein, and enjoy the great sides, wine, and service.  Lastly, my fiance loved the cake dessert - so definitely get that if you go!  I recommend this place, but the price point is a little high for Madison when you are looking for dinner.  Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must try! The food has so much flavor and taste it will make your mouth water.  Great service great presentation great food great atmosphere!!! I can't give it five stars because they serve the smallest martini I've ever had my life. I highly recommend this place if you're in Madison"}
{"text":"Gave up waiting for a server.....  I joined the chef's table at Tory Miller's new establishment last Friday night with an 8 pm reservation.   As other reviewers note, it's a well decorated and finished space with very comfortable chairs and nice ambiance.   And there was Chef Tory, the man, just a few feet from me watching every dish and orchestrating the kitechen!  I waited and waited and waited for a server to recognize me.   After 20 minutes (still no drink) she came by and made a few menu recos and I ordered a cocktail and 2 apps.   I then waited another 10 minutes and decided to try to find her.....because I still had no drink or the bread I ordered.   I found her taking orders for 2 large tables and she completely forgot about me.   I am not sure if Tory even noticed that I sat at his chef table for 30 minutes and could not even get a drink.  That's bad.  With service like this, I think Chef Tory should re-think his front of house plan and management -- he obviously delegated this to an amateur.   I left after 30 minutes of being completely ignored and I will never come back to one of Chef Tory's restaurants.   No restaurant is that worth that kind of wait -- they really were not even that busy!"}
{"text":"Good cocktails, great paella, but some lackluster tapas and service.  Other tables around us were frustrated with inattentive service. It's good, but not one of Madison's greats."}
{"text":"This one was a tough one for me. If I had written this after my first visit, I'd be considering between five and four stars. Second visit was nowhere near the delicious experience we had so it's a bit of a toss up. Unfortunately that's pretty much how it goes at Estrellon's sister restaurants for me too. I really really really want to love everything Tory Miller does but somehow I end up leaving disappointed more often than not. But given how great the first visit was (despite the bad service) I can't quite knock it down to a 3 star place.  Estrellon is an excellent space and a great place to grab food and drinks before a show at the Orpheum or Overture Center. The cocktail menu is unique and the wine list is crazy long. The have beer too but that's not the focus here. Service on our first visit was terrible but on our second visit was excellent. We tried a variety of dishes and highlights easily include the mushrooms and the octopus. Also the beets off the tapas menu was out of this world. Following the first visit, I couldn't wait to come back. After the second, I am much less enthused. If I come back it would be for those mushrooms. Delish."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to nearly all the restaurants in Madison and this is our new favorite. We always sit up at the bar overlooking the kitchen. The food is beautiful and fresh and amazing. The fried guacamole is the greatest thing ever...ever!   Beautiful place and great servers!"}
{"text":"I went in to the restaurant for a dinner. The interiors was quite modern and nice. It has an open kitchen on one side, easy to check out what the chefs (oh! Chef Torri was there). On the other side is a great view of Johnson street traffic with full glass windows.   We shared a couple of small dishes (baked goat cheese in marinara sauce, tortilla, bread) and valenciana paella as an entree. I thought those little dishes were pretty decent and enjoyed most of them. But what was the most impressive was the valenciana paella. It is extremely flavourable, using the seasoning from fresh shrimp i believe. The crispy part near the bottom of the paella pan was excellent it's almost tough to give them up for leftovers.   However, the service was a total mismatch for their food and atmosphere. I cannot believe how they could have ask this kind of service person that does not seem to care about who they are serving. It's probably not worth having to be served by this type of persons for this kind of money you are asking for."}
{"text":"The octopus is fantastically tender.  The basque cake is my favorite dessert in Madison.  This is in or close to the top-tier of small plates places in Madison (Forequarter and Mint Mark are competing for favorite restaurant, though I've never had any dessert at either place as good as the basque cake)."}
{"text":"Like others, I was very excited to try this new restaurant, and it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I had been warned ahead of time about the minuscule portion sizes, so I used the strategy of go with one other person and order everything on the menu (in the tapas bar). Some highlights were--deviled eggs, frites, and tortilla espanola. A lot of the tapas dishes come on one slice of baguette (and I was pretty disappointed that the baguette was not mentioned on the menu since I have Celiac Disease). The one tapas I would definitely not order again was the tuna, as it tasted like canned tuna. Overall a nice addition to the food scene, but they have some room to grow."}
{"text":"Gave Estrellón yet another try after a friend raved about the burger at the bar. It's terrific and definitely a price performer. (The fries seal the deal.) Only problem (maybe a deal breaker) is that they run out fast, so you can't get your heart set on actually eating one. Last night around 6/6:15 I got the last one of only 12 available burgers, to the disappointment to the crew of guys who came in right after looking to eat some themselves. Will definitely go back if the burgers are a guarantee, but otherwise it's a crap shoot."}
{"text":"I have been excited to try this place since I read about it Madison magazine a few months back.  We went last night and I thought it was pretty ok....I'd prob give it 3.5 stars.  A few positives: the food tasted good and we had a nice table by the window.  Our server was also very good- I wish I could remember his name....Alex?  Eric?  He made good recommendations on how much to order because the small, medium, and larger paella plates can leave you needlessly questioning.  We ordered the Valenciana paella and it was good- however- some of the seafood was gritty and my husband almost broke a tooth on a bone fragment or something similar.  The churros dessert with dark chocolate was very good.  A few drawbacks- the decor was fairly generic- it seemed like the Spanish collection for Target- lacking character and the lighting was way too bright.  The drinks were pricey and small.  The paella needs some tweaks and the consistency of ordering is off- we ordered in a few waves and the food came out way out of order.    I would go back and give it another shot- I know they're still working out some kinks."}
{"text":"This place is terrific!  The service is always on point and the food is unique and surprising.    I've taken clients and friends here and always had a great time.  The cocktails change often and are worth the wait.  Best dessert in Madison...The Basque Cake and the churros."}
{"text":"The service is great, the atmosphere matching, but the food leaves a lot to be desired. For the prices and pomp you'd expect the flavours to match. It wasn't that anything was bad, but it just never crossed that line from mediocre to amazing.  The menu can't make up its mind on what the place is wanting to be. In true Wisconsin fashion though, you will find cheese curds. Frankly that is good by us. Adding a twist to a local dish is very spiffy, but the execution wasn't there. We have had tapas in Spain a few times and Estrellon just doesn't fit the mold.  Since the service and atmosphere is stellar we will be back for drinks (12 bucks a glass for Cava...esh), but not to eat."}
{"text":"This was a nice place.  Wait staff were nice and the atmosphere was pleasant. The only real issue I had was that it's very expensive; like $9 for 4 pieces of shrimp expensive.  It's a very nice place but I'm not sure if it's as nice as the prices suggest, and I wasn't as blown away as I'd hoped for ~$50+ for two people."}
{"text":"Love tapas as well as my previous Tori Miller experiences... but Estrellon just didn't do it for me.    As previous posters mentioned, you enter the restaurant and either go to the left for the tapas bar, or to the right for the dining room, which serves from both the \"cena\" menu, as well as the tapas menu.  The waitress explained all the dishes are meant to be shared.  We ordered a couple drinks, which were good, and then also the salmon and beet appetizers.  Out comes one piece of toast with a topping.  How the heck do you share one little piece of toast?  Why wouldn't you have two smaller pieces of toast?  Annoying, but we got over it.  Both were good, but not out of this world.  And we skipped the $18 signature Old Fashioned - nearly $20 for an Old Fashioned in Wisconsin is sacrilegious.    Then we ordered the seafood paella.  Again, comes out with three prawns, 5 clams, 5 mussels, etc.  What's with the \"meant for two\" and giving odd numbers of key ingredients??  The waitress gave us the spoon and fork meant to scrape the socarrat, the caramelized rice on the bottom, but she should have given us an ice scraper to scrape of the burnt, black rice remnants!   The bottom was clearly very black.  When we asked the waitress about it, she insisted it was supposed to be that way.  So a 2 second Google search stated otherwise - it's supposed to be caramelized and brown, not black - and she saw me reading about it over my shoulder and asked if we thought it was too dark.  We said we did, and her response was just \"oh\".  We ate most of it anyway - hey, we paid $55 for a pan of rice - and then ordered the basque cake.  The cake was the best part of the meal, served with custard and cranberry compote.  If I came back again, it would be for the late night happy hour (bartender's choice $5 cocktails) and I would get the cake again.  But there just wasn't anything that really sung to me at this place, and the laissez faire attitude about poorly prepared food just really turned me off.    Tori, we'll be back to Graze many times, but I suggest some additional training for your staff at Estrellon.  There are so many good restaurants in Madison, I can't see trying this again after our first experience."}
{"text":"The Café: A cute place but there were not many tables there. They had other seating areas with very low tables which were impossible to eat on but good for just drinking coffee and eating a pastry.   They did not have as large of a crêpe selection as I'd hoped. I ordered the crepe with mushrooms, tomatoes, manchego cheese and egg. Our waitress said that it was the best crepe there so I was hoping for big things. The crepe was good, but not as good as I hoped--there was definitely something missing. I also got a chocolate croissant--it was good but a little dry (I've had better).  My friend got the Apple, cheddar and egg crêpe--which I must say was a lot more satisfying than mine. All the flavors blended perfectly. I would definitely recommend this crepe to anyone who wants to go here.   Although the food was just okay, the service was great. Everyone was very kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Great food, fun to share all the dishes. Provided an excellent variety of well-executed, creative dishes. Some of our favorites were the Pulpo, baked goat cheese, and Valencian citrus salad. Our waitress, Jill was excellent and gave great recommendations. Robby, the other waiter, was pretty good too."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've eaten here. The paella was good. Pricey place for small plates."}
{"text":"So I really wanted to love this restaurant.  Long term love.  Always and forever love.  The restaurant is owned by a great chef, the reservations are difficult to get for a weekend, the downtown atmosphere is right and the menu....wow it sounds amazing!  The actual meal and experience though was like that first date that the online profile was a little different than meeting in person.  First let me say, it was good.  There is nothing that stands out as \"that's the last date\" deal breaker.  The service was excellent, provided by a server named Michael S. who knew the menu like he wrote it himself.  Always helpful, insightful and descriptive with his answers, not to mention keeping the glasses full and the table clean without the invasive, annoying, in your business attitude you find in the service industry.  We were seated in an area with a long bench and tables a little too close together, the kind where you can order based on what the next table over is having and possibly take a fork full of theirs to sample before you commit.  This caused the wait staff to have to edge in between the tables to talk and I am now acutely aware of what type of jeans the waiter for the table next to us was wearing.  These are little gripes, nothing that turns me off. The meal was where I started wondering if the relationship was going to work out.  I love tapas, and the idea of tasting as many things as you can.  So we did.  While we were looking at the menu the people at the table next to us warned us away from a couple of things they had, like the baked goat cheese they deemed \"meh\".  So we tried other items.  We had some amazing dishes, to be completely fair.  The crab ceviche was so good that my wife ordered a second one.  The oysters were very good, and the brie also.  But then we tried the marinated tuna, which frankly was similar to canned Charlie the Tuna.  The pot roast, which sounded amazing, was sliced like seared tuna and very dry and not what you would expect given the menu description.  My octopus however, was so tender I would not have guessed that is what I was eating, in a pleasant way.  We had the standard marinated olives which had a nice kiss of orange/citrus to them and the dates wrapped in prosciutto which were more savory than expected and worth ordering.  To quote another person who reviewed this place \"If it's a crostini, then say it's a crostini\".  If the Brie is actually a crostini, one bite, with brie then put that on the menu.   By the end I was wondering if we were just going to shake hands and go our separate ways, there were a lot of good flavors but not a lot of WOW.  Then the Basque cake  arrived.  They had read my message on open table that it was my wife's birthday so there was a candle on top of the most amazing cake I have ever eaten.  Soft and good on the inside with a firmer outside and served with the right tartness of cherries and sweetness of ice cream, for the win of best bite of the night. tonight.  So will we run off and elope?  Probably not.  But we may casually date and in a town like Madison with a ton of other choices it would be very difficult to commit to regular visits.  Definitely worth trying, but I think it is still a work in progress."}
{"text":"I expected a lot of Estrellón and they really exceeded expectations in one key element: the service. As busy as opening weekend was, they maintained a steady stream of staff checking in on us and making sure our water glasses were full. Our server was very patient and kind and gave us a very thorough explanation of each dish before ordering. If you are unsure of the portion or description of the fish, be sure to ask!  The food itself was good on the whole, with some needing slight tweaks. Their menu shows promise and they made sure to seek out feedback so that any misses could be improved. My favorites were the charred beet crostini and the watermelon gazpacho. I did not expect to like the mix of crab and watermelon gazpacho, but it went together very well.   In sum, the atmosphere is great and the food is generally delicious. I look forward to  spending casual evenings in their bar area enjoying tapas and sangria."}
{"text":"Estrellon, or a male conjugation of \"star\" in Spanish, is a carefully and respectable establishment in the Capital Square restaurant block. Most of the reviews talk about the food, and I will as well, but my first visit was to hang out at the bar, so I will be focusing on that aspect.   The food is tapas, since in America it seems all Spanish restaurants have to be tapas restaurants. But unlike other restaurants who call their plates tapas only so they could overcharge the customer, the tapas here are legitimately in the spirit of tapas. In Spain, tapas are like food carts where you pay a euro and grab a small bite of fried seafood and sangria. Here, that fundamental spirit was maintained, even if it was atop silverware and linen. All the items are small and cheap, usually around $2-$3, and a full meal will take a constellation of these. My prior experiences with tapas have been Catalonian, so there was an emphasis on seafood, but I felt that here the emphasis was more on cured meats. Whether that's a stylistic choice or merely the impossibility of procuring good seafood in Madison I don't know.   The drinks, like the food, were well done and with expertise. I struck up a conversation with the bartender, and I learned of the fact that Wisconsin does their Old Fashioned with an orange slice and grenadine. This explained why I was always confused about why my prior orders were so sweet. The bartender there knows what he's doing, and when he accidentally made me a vodka martini when I wanted a gin one, he soundlessly gave me the correct one gratis. Good job bartender for knowing enough to know when you've made a mistake."}
{"text":"My better half and I stopped in before the Frostiball soiree and left underwhelmed. This was our second visit here and probably the last.  Don't get me wrong-nothing was terrible but then again, with the exception of the scallops, everything was just ok (scallops were definitely are favorite).  Combine that with sometimes lazy service (ie. water glasses not always being filled promptly) and a 150+ bill for two (2 glasses of wine each, no dessert) and it's just not worth it.  We ordered a variety of dishes-raw oysters, huevos a la Lucio (eggs, iberico ham, fries), scallops, and the collection of 4 cured hams.  The ham was good but then again, there is no effort in the kitchen for this just good sourcing with great producers.  The oysters were poorly shucked with shell fragments spalling off into the oyster.  Again, just nothing that would warrant a return. Yes, I know it's a Tory Miller restaurant but accolades in the past are not an excuse for turning out average food that doesn't warrant the cost."}
{"text":"Ah I feel bad giving Estrellon 3 stars. Overall, I had a great experience here, but I've had a lot of amazing tapas in my lifetime and most of the tapas at Estrellon were only okay for the price.   My party of three got the prix fixe dinner for two ($90) and in addition ordered the baked goat cheese and pork belly. There was a ton of food and we left feeling so full. Come hungry and order the dinner for two menu; it's a great deal. My favorites:  Coquetas Paella Basque cake - My friends don't like desserts so I ate both plates. No regrets.   The pork belly was delicious, but as a large plate it was pretty small. The pulpo (octopus) is usually my favorite dish. The ones here were very tender, but the pieces were cut a bit too small and there definitely wasn't enough octopus. I would come back just for the paella, that was phenomenal. We got every last bit of rice and end up just licking the spoon."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening around 9:45 P.M. The restaurant is split into two sides, the dining rom and the tapas bar. The dining room requires reservations while the tapas bar does not take any. However, for a weekend evening, there were plenty of seats and we sat around the tapas bar. It was an elegant place with nice and friendly bartenders. I tried the olive oil cured tuna, jamon iberico, crab ceviche, and grilled shrimp. We tried porron pours and cocktails also.  I was a bit disappointed to learn that everything (besides the ceviche) was on a crostini (it is not directly stated on the menu and I feel that the bread overwhelms the rest of the ingredients at times). The bites are delicate and we were glad that we were only stopping in to try a few bites: to rely on these for dinner would require far too many orders. The jamon iberico was delicious, tender and flavorful (but again, on a crostini. We deconstructed it and ate the jamon itself to truly appreciate the flavors). Grilled shrimp was also delicious and the paste it came with was well done. I would personally skip the tuna. It tasted like regular cooked fish and lacked the smoky cured flavor I was hoping for. The crab ceviche was very well done too.  My drink was expertly made and we all found our porron pours (directly from vessel to mouth) to be a fun novelty to try (when out on a Friday night...). Overall, I would say that this s a very pricey place to try out, but the tapas are expertly done. The flavors are apparent and it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Babe and I stopped in for breakfast. I had the baguette with manchego, jamon and djon; Babe had the hickory bourbon croissant. Absolutely delicious! I had a cortado, cream and espresso, I would use the sugar packet unless you like super bitter coffee. I would engage the friendly staff for suggestions; the service was excellent. We will be going back for dinner, the space is decorated very well."}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant! We decided to have an early dinner here before an event and was wowed by the beautiful interior, great staff and food. The variety of tapas and fresh ingredients made for a fun taste testing of several shared orders. The chef created beautifully plated selections that were as great tasting as they looked. Our waitress had extensive knowledge of the menu and was so attentive. Love this place and will be coming back soon to try their paella."}
{"text":"So many choices!  I went with a group of 5 and we were able to order a number of yummy items.  The more people, the more you can order!  The scallop was lovely as were the choice of cheeses. We had quite the spread and enjoyed our meal with a bottle of the Verdello and Rose from their extensive Spanish wines!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new place in Madison and I was attracted by  the tapas menu and the chef's credentials. It was absolutely wonderful. We tried an interesting mix of small plates including  meatballs, potato croquettes, bread with tomato, spicy shrimp, Jamon relish, maybe a couple more.   Then, OMG the basque cake bowl.  To. Die. For.   There were many more I would have loved to try.  Some reviewers complain about the size of the dishes. We asked, our server told us exactly what to expect so I don't see the issue.  In fact, I wouldn't have wanted them to be much larger.  Interesting cocktails and a good wine and liquor list.  This would be my go to restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"I really debated between 2 and 3 stars for this one. It's somewhere in-between. We visited a few weeks ago. Madison, WI is a very, very cold place. On this evening the wind was whipping and the temps were brutally cold. Sadly, the restaurant was also uncomfortably cold. We both wore our coats through the meal as did several tables around us. That should be something that gets noticed. When you see your customers sitting around with coats and scarves on, turn up the heat.   The space is pretty cavernous. It is divided into a large bar/tapas area on one side and a very large dining room on the other. One side of the dining room has an open view of part of the kitchen. Overall, it's an inviting place.  We tried several tapas including the Charred beets, Manchego, lemon, which really had no char on it at all and was pretty tame and boring. The standout of the tapas was Jamón Ibérico, tomato jam, relish. Jamon Iberico is a delicious, thinly-sliced ham-like product that may remind you of prosciutto or speck. These were both served in a crostini fashion.   We then moved on to grilled octopus. When it arrived it was an attractive dish with sliced, tender pieces of octopus thickly coated in smoked paprika. Each of us took a bite and looked at each other. It was insanely over-salted. We agreed it had to go back. The waitress declined to taste it, but happily replaced it. She then stated \"can I get you a couple more tapas to fill the time?\" Now, how would you interpret that? We both thought it was something like this \"can I comp you a couple tapas while we fix the issue...\" So, we say sure and she chooses a couple for us to try.   The octopus came and this one had no spice on it but rather had the spices on the side. That's not something we asked for, just something the waitress did. A couple issues. First, examining the spices in the little ramekin it was a mixture of salt and smoked paprika. This made me think that they are spinning these spices together then applying them. The problem was that the ratio was way off with entirely too much salt. The second issue is that anyone with even modest cooking skill knows that *when* you salt is very important. You can't just cook something then douse it with finishing salt. We spiced our own octopus, had a few bites and then called it a night.   When we get the bill - remember those \"tapas I can get you...?\" Well, they were on the bill.   One interesting thought. The very next night we tried another Spanish-influenced place in Milwaukee called Amalinda which was just plain amazing - like 4-star amazing. I got to thinking about the differences and developed a theory. It's clear that whomever designed the menu at Estrellon knows what he's doing. (This is another restaurant from a group owned by a prominent executive chef). I felt the same way about this place as I did about one of his other restaurants, Graze. It feels like the menu is designed, things are dialed in, and then it's turned over to staff. And from there, things go South. Conversely, at Amalinda, you can literally see the executive chef preparing every dish himself. No way is a James Beard nominee (or did he even win one?) making mistakes on how and when to salt a dish. The place where that is going wrong is with the staff. I think with stronger oversight, this place could really shine as the menu variety and design looks to be very strong.   I will give it another try and update here."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here on a Friday night. When we walked into the restaurant there were not many people around, which was odd for a Friday night. We sat at the Tapas bar and ordered some Tapas. The highlight was the jamon iberico which was quite tasty (almost as good as those I had in Europe!). The crab ceviche was refreshing and I enjoyed the shrimp crostini as well. All of the dishes are in the $3-6 range and you'll need quite a bit of these to get full but we came here for a late night snack so it was just right.  The drinks we had here were decent. No complaints at the end. Overall had a great experience here, I do hope that they get some more business here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!!  Be sure to ask to sit at the bar in the kitchen. This way you can watch your amazing meal be created. Be sure to save room for the Basque Cake after your meal. It is a delicious cake with a light custard baked in and served with ice cream and berries.  Also highly recommend the Donut Peach Tapas, the scallop, and the squash blossom. We were lucky enough to have Tony Miller, chef, explain our plates and inspirations as he served them. (Another good reason to sit at the bar in the kitchen). Love this place!!!  We will be back. :)  9/19/15: Tried out Estrellon for breakfast. My husband ordered the jamon crepe and I the jamon baguette sandwich. The crepe was amazing!  The baguette had fabulous ingredients, unfortunately the taste was lost to a heavy handed smear of Dijon mustard that obliterated the other flavors. :( The coffee and lattes are very good. Be sure to have a cream filled Xuxo pastry!!!!  So amazing that we had to order one to go. Staff is exceptionally friendly, yet again. Atmosphere is comforting and crisp. We felt as if we were in a warm French cafe. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love Tapas. But I did not love these Tapas. The front of house staff felt very cold when we walked in, checking us out head to toe with judging eyes. Not a welcoming experience. I felt that the food was just okay, not great. Our server was pretty bad... Maybe brand new...Our first round of tapas made it to the table before my partners beer with no sorry or explanation, Our server was thought I wanted two whiskey drinks right away after I changed my mind to change my Bourbon up to a Bourbon Manhattan. Why would I want two whiskey drinks as the same time? Here is our food run down: The Ham pate just tastes like mayo. The Cottage Cheese Dunk was just sour cream and chips... pretty blah.  The deviled eggs are nothing special.  The charred beets were really tasty.  The Smoked Salmon, now that WAS awesome.  After our first visit to Estrellon, it will probably be our last. Nothing about it felt special, or even inviting."}
{"text":"After living in Spain for over 2 years this restaurant is by far as close to authentic that I've found in Madison. I cannot get enough of their pulpo gallego!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for a Sunday evening with my partner for dinner. We had noted on the reservation that we were celebrating an anniversary, and were pleasantly surprised when we were seated and the hostess acknowledged this, and offered to bring some cava in celebration; so to start, wonderful service.  We chose the chef's menu so that we could get a taste of a little bit of everything, and also added the pork belly from the large plates. The kitchen incorporated this plate into our meal where they thought it would best \"go,\" which was right after the Pan Con Tomate. We were able to try those two dishes, the curried carrots, the tortilla espanola, potato croquetas, the octopus, crostini with jamon iberico, the Paella Valencia, and the Basque cake. Everything was delicious and the serving sizes were perfect for the number of courses, which were spaced very thoughtfully. The standout dish for me was the Paella Valencia because of the abundance of well-cooked seafood and the perfectly crispy rice at the bottom. The flavors were really complimented by the addition of the aioli and chorizo. I was also surprised by how good the Basque cake and tortilla espanola were, as they were the dishes I was least curious about.  I would definitely return and order the octopus and paella a la carte, with a few of the other small plates we didn't get to try. Overall the quality and atmosphere are both so wonderful and perfect for a special occasion."}
{"text":"After living in Madison for 5 years now, Estrellon is just simply one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. It never disappoints, and I would say that Estrellon serves up some of the best Spanish cuisine I've ever had. The seafood paella is excellent if you're a seafood lover - lots of fresh fish and incredible flavors. You can tell that the chefs pay attention to little details, with every ingredient meshing together seamlessly for an exquisite dish. They also have many creative appetizers (fried guacamole...yum!!!) and sliced jamón....everything is always delicious. Don't shy away from the seasonal paellas, as well as their dessert - their basque cake is up there with my favorite desserts of all time.  Overall, Estrellon is an excellent choice for fine dining Spanish fare. It's a perfect place to go for a fancy night out or a romantic dinner! Absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"PROS: Tasty tapas, excellent service CONS: Some dishes were overpriced  Puncture a hole in your wallet and let the money flow in exchange for tasty morsels on small plates. Prices feel inflated, but my stomach was satisfied nevertheless. Overall, a relaxing spot to share some tapas with some buddies while lounging about. Unfortunately, we didn't get to sample the bakery items, as the cafe portion only stays open till 2pm daily."}
{"text":"Wow! How come I never visit here before? This is really a great restaurant in the center of downtown. I usually not giving 5 stars as you have no way to go and upgrade yourself with 5 of 5 but as I cannot give 4.75....I'm giving them 5 stars. We eat way too many of their small plates - all so good. You have to have company who is ready to share - and all 4 of us do love to share so it was great.  And - no matter what - keep room to dessert. We tried 3 of them - all just perfect.  Comment: we ate with a great and lovely young couple and we enjoy their company so much - and maybe that why I have giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wish I should give it 4.5 stars. Most important thing. You need the Basque cake. Absolutely! if you dont eat anything else you need that. One of the best things I have eaten. If you can sit at the kitchen table. It overlooks the prep area and you get to see some cool things.   Overall the food is good. Nothing blew me away. All solid items that were a good portion for the cost. Worth going in Madison's growing food area."}
{"text":"Had dinner with some friends here and had a good experience. Great service, great flavors, and really nice atmosphere. One of my friends was super excited to see Jamón Ibérico on the menu. I look forward to returning, just be prepared to drop a good amount, as it's pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! The atmosphere was trendy but not too uptight. There was a great wine and cocktail selection.  We sampled several tapas, which were all delicious, but verrryyy small portions, so my husband and I ordered entrees as well. After a couple drinks, tapas, and two entrees, this place is more expensive than other places in the area, which is okay except that some of the tapas were literally a couple bites. They were delicious bites, but it would be nice to know on the menu how many each tapas serves.  The hostess and server were great, and overall it was fun and relaxing. We'll plan on returning!"}
{"text":"COST: $12-20 (Various Cocktails) $5-20 (Various Tapas)  Went here for their tapas bar and was not disappointed. I had the daiquiri for drinks, jamon and salmon for their tapas.  The salmon was definitely the highlight for me. It had greek yogurt, chives, caviar AND honey to top it all off... all locally sourced of course.  The place can get very expensive if you order multiple things and eat a lot, but that's pretty standard for a tapas bar. I'll have to try their dinner service at some point!"}
{"text":"I met up with friends (and fellow yelpers) here last Thursday night; we came for the Sujeo Korean Tapas Popup, which was taking place in the bar. Wow! It was my first visit, and we were only in the bar area, but it's very nice. Dark wood, pleasantly dim lighting, comfortable pub table seating. We sampled a selection of drinks (partially because of an ordering mixup) including the sangria special, a regular margarita, and a curiously named 'Local Asian' (my personal favorite), and all were very good. But the real standout was the popup Korean tapas from Tory Miller and crew. They started serving them counter service style promptly at 8 pm, and we tried the shrimp and chorizo fried rice, the pork belly bao, the tomato bread, and another offering I'm forgetting. Everything was incredibly delicious, to the point that I may have gone back for seconds. Tory was kind enough to prepare portions of the fried rice without shrimp in consideration for my friend's shellfish allergy. We really enjoyed the atmosphere, the service and the food, and I hope to revisit Estrellón soon to try the full restaurant."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointing.  Incredibly overpriced for the poor quality.   The dragon tongue beans were tasty and the gazpacho was surprisingly complex, but of the dozen or so tapas we ordered those were the only highlights.  We ordered one croquetta of each type but they all tasted exactly the same, like a glorified cheese curd.  The carabineros were tasty but not as fresh as they should have been for the price.  In sum, not worth the hype.  Tory Miller should have stuck with L'Etoile and Graze, since everything else he's done has just gone downhill."}
{"text":"Estrellon offers up three distinct menus for its café, its tapas bar and the main dining room.  This review focuses on the Estrellon Café, which operates from 7am until 2:30pm Tuesday through Sunday.  The Café offers up a variety of pastries, coffee & tea drinks, sandwiches and crepes. In many ways, it is reminiscent of chef Tory Miller's late, great Café Soleil (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-soleil-madison) which was a popular haunt of mine on the Square ten years prior.  After visiting five times in six days (yes, I'm rather obsessive about finding quality baked goods), Café Estrellon has generally left a good taste in my mouth.  First and foremost, the croissants are the real deal.  The top is feather light with thin flaking layers, has an airy tender interior and a hint of the rich flavor of butter.  The bottom of my chocolate croissant had an amazing crunch of caramelized butter and bittersweet chocolate.  I'm getting all dreamy eyed just typing up this review - excuse me for a moment while I compose myself...  ...Ok, all better.  I'm also a fan of the coffee from Aerodyne Coffee Rosters of Milwaukee.  While my first cup was on the weak side, the subsequent cups were superb.  Deep flavor, a hint of chocolate notes that paired perfectly with my croissant and absolutely no bitterness.  It easily could become my favorite cup o' Joe in town.  And the server at the bar did a fantastic job of keeping my cup topped off while noshing on my croissant.  Also superb was the egg, jamón and manchego crepe.  The buckwheat crepe was simply gorgeous, with a mosaic of brown and white tones with a golden, uncooked egg yolk in the center.  The exterior of the crepe offered a little crunch to contrast with the velvety texture of the ham and cheese interior.  The interplay between the sweet, lingering flavor of the manchego paired well with the subtle, nutty flavors of the jamón.  I was less of a fan of my sandwich.  While the ingredient list was top notch (Spanish ham, Pleasant Ridge Reserve cheese and Dijon mustard on a freshly baked baguette), the ingredients were terribly out of balance.  The delicate flavors of the jamón and cheese were simply overwhelmed by the large, crusty baguette and the liberal dose of intensely flavored Dijon.  With some fine tuning, there is potential for a fantastic sandwich.  The set-up of the café is slightly confusing for the first time visitor.  When you enter, you'll be immediately drawn to the well-stocked pastry counter.   As you start to order your pastries, you be instructed to instead go to the bar on the far end of the café, where you'll also see the café menu on a small chalkboard.  The staff is generally friendly and helpful, though the staff behind the pastry counter can be aloof at times (probably from being fatigued from constantly directing customers to the bar to order their food).    Parking is also a challenge, as there are limited parking options on West Johnson. I usually find a parking spot on West Mifflin near the Cap Centre parking garage and hoof it to the café"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful meal. The front is a little nondescript but once I found the place, I was given the option of a table or a kitchen counter seat. I definitely recommend sitting at the kitchen counter and enjoy the show. Watching the chefs delicately and simply prepare every dish adds another dimension to your meal. There were so many options but I opted for the tasting menu which turned out to be more then enough food for 1. I sit here with an engorged belly remembering the tasty shrimp, slight spice to the carrots, the enormity of the paella, and the soft layers of potato and egg. Everything was fantastic and I washed it all down with spicy tequila and a white sangria. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Word.  This was fabulous from start to finish, with a friendly even jocular maitre d' and a lovely waitress who gave us carefully thought out and thorough recommendations.  We started with the baked goat cheese, refried sweet potatoes, beets, and blood sausage.  All of them were excellent.  Large plates we had grilled octopus and grilled lamb chop.  The octopus had been marinated overnight then perfectly cooked and seasoned, served with roasted potatoes.  The meat came out the consistency of a hard boiled egg, not at all rubbery like octopus usually gets.  The lamb was divine, pink in the middle, and served on a unique chick pea blend.  Dessert was the basque cake with cherry compote and churro with chocolate.  The churros were good, as churros go, but the dipping chocolate was heavenly.  We even drank some of it straight just so it wouldn't go to waste, albeit allowing it to go to waist.  The highlight of the evening was the basque cake, a delicate white cake served warm with the cherries and a little scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Highly recommend this place, no reservations so make a reservation."}
{"text":"Long overdue visit to this restaurant which is part of a group which includes Graze and L'Etoile.  We were very pleased to find the sommelier we know, Stephen, working.  He set a table for us by a window, and soon enough came to talk to us about opening drinks.  We were treated to glasses of a surprisingly fine Spanish Cava - the sparkling wine of Spain which compares favorably with Champagne.  It was excellent.  Shortly after beginning to enjoy the bubbles, we placed our order, from a menu you'll see among the pics I've posted: Grilled Shrimp Refried Sweet Potatoes Patatas Bravas Pulpo a la Gallega Blackened Scallops Albondigas Grilled Brisket.  The real STANDOUTS for us were the Octopus, Scallops, and Brisket; any one of which would've made the trip worthwhile.  As big fans of Spanish wines, especially Tempranillo, we were quite impressed with the substantial wine list - good work!  We're also very fond of both  Octopus (pulpo in Spanish) and Scallops, both of which were excellent.  The meatballs were downright flavorsome in their lovely sauce, and the brisket was among the best we've ever eaten - certainly superior to the standard New England Boiled Dinner being served all over the country around this time - St Patrick's Day - when everyone wants to be Irish.  [ Tá mé na hÉireann ]  On thing that was especially nice was the noise level - it was very quiet and calm, and the dining room was at least half filled with diners.  Also notable is the price-point, for the quality of the food here, their prices represent a good value for the money.  Definitely worth a trip to, but if you're not familiar with menus like theirs, talk to your waiter/waitress so you know how much food you'll get from the different parts of the menu before ordering.  In our case, they told us without asking, but I've read some people complaining that they didn't get enough to eat.  I feel it is most incumbent on the diner to know what he or she is ordering and how much it will take to be satiated.  You have to take some responsibility on yourself to make an order from a custom menu that's going to please both palate and tummy.  Given a chance, Estrellón will deliver on, and to, both of those!  About the marvelous red wine we drank: 1995 R. López de Heredia Rioja Reserva Viña Tondonia,  Appearance was clear at the edge with orange bricking to a burgundy core. It has a nose of fig, sherry, caramel, and candied cherry. Similar notes on the palate with ample acidity and resolved tannins to carry a beautiful finish. Aging well and in a great window now!"}
{"text":"Diverse selection of tapas supported by a top-notch wine list and a well-appointed dining space. The real star are the desserts made from Taylor Feldmann.  Overall the flavors were good but salt seasoning was sporadic and some were perfect while others quite lacking. Of the 25-ish tapas we ordered, none offered any real spice or unique, lasting notes.  The pacing was frenetic with multiple plates arriving at the same time while on other occasions plates seemed to have 15-20 minute lulls. It's best to put in orders of at least 6 selections (for a table for 3) to help manage.   The specialty Manhattan with aged bourbon is pricey but worth every penny. The selection of desserts is minimal compared to the savory options but you must save room for the Basque cake--it is hands down one of the best \"cake\" desserts in the city and is arguably the crowning jewel of Estrellón."}
{"text":"Smoked Sockeye Salmon Crostini was the true hero of the tapas.  Charred Beet Crostini and Brie Crostini were equally amazing.  Basque Cake brought this one home to being a fantastic dining experience.  Drinks were well-prepared and tastefully executed."}
{"text":"I'd actually give Estrellón a 4.7 if it were an option. I took my husband here to celebrate his birthday dinner, and we ordered the blistered tomatoes, sugar snap peas, vegetarian paella, Basque cake, and ricotta spread with chips. The blistered tomatoes and sugar snap peas were delicious--a feast for both the eyes and palate! The paella was also very good although I felt that the bottom was a tad too \"crispy\"/blackened. The Basque cake was delightful . . . although I may be in the minority in preferring the churros with that decadent dipping sauce. I thought the ricotta dip (and basically potato chips) were not worth ordering because they were mediocre. The total with two glasses of good wine and a magic coffee was about $120 with tip. If you're just a party of two, I recommend requesting the counter to watch the chefs at work. Chef Tory was not there on this particular Saturday night, but the female chef in charge was very observant and seemed to give good direction. I did notice that the servers did not explain each dish before presenting it, which had happened on a previous night when Chef Miller was present. Something odd also happened with my Open Table reservation, and I was emailed 5 hours before that my reservation was at 8:00 although I had made it for 6:30 about a week before (and received a confirmation). The person who answered the phone was polite and corrected the unexpected change in time. Overall, an elegant restaurant with innovative food/presentation and good vegetarian options. Kudos to Chef Miller!"}
{"text":"A group of four of us ventured out to Estrellon last night for the first time and we had a really nice meal. I will say up-front that this was a very expensive meal for the overall amount of food we had, but I don't think anyone left the table unsatisfied. In general I'd say the small plates are a much better value and the large plates leave quite a bit to be desired in terms of portion size. The wine list is extensive and we enjoyed an EXCELLENt Rose Cave and a very fine Tempranillo over the course of the meal. A few specific comments on the dishes we tried:  Grilled Brisket - This was far and away the WORST dish of the evening. The portion size was almost insultingly small and the flavors and textures were no where near as interesting or vibrant as most of the other dishes. This was honestly the only part of the meal that was bad, but it was BAD! Take this one off the menu...  Pulpo - Very nice dish. Of all the food I enjoyed in Barcelona this was my favorite dish and Estrellon pulls it off well. I would have liked a bit more potato to pair with the octopus but the textures were a perfect match for one another. Would certainly have this again.   Oyster Mushrooms - Very good dish. The particular piquancy of the ramps was lost a bit but the composition as a whole was lovely.   Gambas - Good but not great. There was a slight, but noticeably distracting tang to this dish that really took it down a notch for me. I believe it was probably from the Sherry but I could be wrong. I also thought the garlic was far to subtle and should have played a more pronounced role on the palate.    Grilled shrimp Pintxos - Again, good but not great. Shrimp might have been VERY slightly undercooked for my taste and I thought the spread under the shrimp was a pit overpowering.   Jamon - The Berkshire is very good but the Iberico is OUTSTANDING! I don't care for the crackers this is served with, skip those, but the ham itself is so deep and flavorful. Amazingly good stuff, even if you don't get much to savor.   Refried sweet potatoes - This was the surprise standout of the night! Wow; everything about this dish worked together perfectly! The creamy sweetness of the tubers, the sharp vinegar tang of the pickled onions, the spice of a top notch chorizo, the crunch from onions and radish. This was excellent! Highly, highly recommended.   Patatas Bravas - Another huge winner for me. The potatoes were delicious, with a lovely texture, and the two sauces on top paired exquisitely. I got a deep, round, peppery note (I'm guessing a paprika) as well as a creamy but not boring aioli flavor.   Pan con tomate - I don't know how such a simple dish can taste so good but I LOVE this combination. The tomatoes Estrellon is sourcing are also exemplary, which was a major contributor here and in the paella.    Paella Valenciana - An absolute classic executed so, so well. The textures, the tastes, the smells, the look, everything about this dish was amazing. All that being said, I could not believe how perfect the tomatoes were in this dish! To have a rich, complex dish like paella noticeably enriched by a simple tomato was unexpected but incredibly welcome! We loved this dish.   Basque cake - Almost unspeakably good, a MUST have. Don't like dessert? Order it. Already full? Order it. Diabetic and can't eat sweets? Take a shot of insulin and ORDER IT! Honestly, one of the best desserts I've ever had! So simple, yet I have NO IDEA how they achieved the textures in this cake. The mouthfeel is sublime; almost as if it's undercooked, but it now way feels or tastes unfinished. This is worth the hype, worth the price, and a MUST have. ORDER IT!   The space is beautiful and welcoming. The room was busy but not crowded with a nice buzz. I felt welcomed and well served by the staff all night. Dishes arrived quickly and somewhat scattered but the pace never felt frantic. All in all this was a really nice experience.   Okay, so this all sounds quite laudatory, why only four stars? First off, that brisket dish was a travesty. I wish it s never ordered and it cast a pallor on much of the rest of the emal. Secondly, for the amount we paid I felt the portion sizes for many of the dishes was lacking. Yes, I get tapas, I knew what I was ordering going in and had my expectations set appropriately. I wasn't caught off guard by any of this, but I still feel like the portion sizes were too small for the price point. It's not enough to keep me from ever coming back, but it's enough to place Estrellon in my second tier of Madison restaurants."}
{"text":"Made reservations for dinner before an Overture Center show through Open Tables.  They had a wonderful table set up for us, just as I asked for.  The restaurant is stunningly beautiful.  Comfy chairs and big windows.  My guests and I had a lot of fun trying to navigate the menu.  The menu could have had better descriptions of size but our server was extremely helpful.  She may not have known everything by heart but she had detailed notes to help guide us.  We ordered the Market Paella and many little plates to share.  The croqueta with cod was tasty.  The cheese plate was a nice way to try the cheeses you want to try.  The mushrooms were the stand out dish of the little plates.  The Paella came out and it was visually beautiful.  My mother enjoyed the paella very much.  While I enjoyed the flavor profile of the paella, I thought it was missing something to (that or I had really wanted the seafood paella).  I will have to come back and try the more traditional one.    We choose to have the churros and drinking chocolate for dessert.  The churros were cooked perfectly and dunking them into the chocolate was very good.  But drinking the drinking chocolate was not great.  It is pretty bitter.  So order coffee with dessert, that was a better choice.  I am sure to explore this restaurant and bar again.  Chef Tory Miller has an adventurous spirit and an eye for beauty.  He is an artist."}
{"text":"Enjoy the ambiance and sharing plates, but be prepared to order a lot of plates!  Two menus are available: a tapas menu for the tapas/bar area, and an additional menu for the main dining area.  The dining area menu actually has a lot of small items as well.  Overall, the paella is the only self-contained entree , as you would definitely want to order additional plates even if you had one of the heartier choices.    Grilled octopus was our favorite item; simply prepared, as it was grilled with a slice of lemon, but it was nicely tender.  Lamb sausage was also notable for white beans that were at the correct doneness.  Among the tapas we ordered, it was pleasant to order two dishes for which you could order more than one bite.  I do recommend asking the server exactly what each item entails prior to ordering. The charred beets was a crostini topped with cheese, beets, and a lemony pine nut paste.  From the menu, there is no indication that this is a crostini, so I expected a small plate of roasted beets. Asking the server is also important due to serving size--I understand that tapas are for sharing, but when I asked about the size of green beans (and other types of beans) w/ cream fraiche, the server indicated that it entailed of about 5-7 beans. Ouch.  Albondigas (a type of meatball), ambivalent, same with the croqueta de jamón.  Padrón peppers, a mildly spicy fresh pepper, stuffed with cheese and wrapped with ham--enjoyable, but not mindblowing.  To me, the patatas bravas tasted good, but not what I would expect.  Patatas bravas are typically chunks of potatoes but these were in an American thick french fry shape. To me it was essentially french fries with hot sauce and some aioli and parsley.  Raspberry ginger sangria was refreshing but I would have a tough time differentiating it from other sangrias.  A more knowledgeable person than I would be able to comment about the wine selection, although I did notice a lot of specific Spanish varietals, such as txakoli. The dining area does harken to a Spanish hacienda a little, considering the metalwork on the windows and you can see the jamón ibérico and the plated tapas items ready to go behind glass.  The service and ambiance is gracious, but not fussy. You're on your own for parking, although the Ovation building sometimes has public parking for a fee.  Next time I go, I'll bring a group of friends and order the paella and a variety of dishes so we can have both the heartier paella and the small plates."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, underwhelming drinks. However all is made up for in the deliciousness of some of the small plates and the heartiness if the paella. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Dinner was a fun experience. I loved the variety they had on the menu. We were able to try several different tapas and there wasn't one that we didn't like.   The grilled octopus was the favorite. It was tender and flavorful. The grilled lamb chop was on point and had a great sear to it.   I found their wine menu to be a little obscure. We found ourselves having a hard time choosing a bottle and were not impressed with the one we chose.   Overall, I highly recommend giving this place a try. It's a fun experience with great food!"}
{"text":"Tasty, clean, comfortable and formal atmosphere, and good service. The food was a fusion of Spanish recipes that included Wisconsin ingredients. I really enjoyed the tapas and Paella Valencia. My favorite was the Pulpo (octopus). My friend who lived in Spain had different expectations and was disappointed by our meal. For example, the waitress scraped the paella pan bottom, insisting the burnt stuck on rice had the best flavors. According to my friend, that was a no-no."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now twice in the morning and once for drinks and tapas before a show. All 3 times on the bar/lounge side. When you walk in you can either go to the left or right. The right side is for dinner service.  Service has been great all three times. The first time we went in for breakfast the person behind the bar was helpful with the menu and explained the different coffee options and such. Our son also has a dairy allergy and the women assured us the hot chocolate powder they use had no milk powder and they used soy milk. She also made sure it was a manageable temperature and had a nice sweetness to it. She explained the powder was a very bittersweet chocolate and then they added a sweetener to it.  Both times we went in the morning I got the xuxo croissant. It is amazing. Its a cinnamon sugar croissant shaped pastry filled with vanilla bean pastry cream. I enjoyed it so much thats what I got the next time. Hopefully I will be able to update my review with other things I've tried if I can resist the xuxo next time but I'm not making any promises.  At the bar at night I had a glass of wine recommended by the bartender and then a red sangria which was delicious and not too sweet. For their happy hour you get a free tapa with a wine purchase. I has one with prosciutto and some other toppings on a crostini I can't remember but it was super tasty but a little messy to eat. We also shared a some papas fritas with a garlic aoili and red sauce those were good too.   Overall 5 for the xuxo croissant and 4 the evening food I think I just have to try more. And overall service was very good. I'd like to come back and try a few more tapas and maybe dinner for a special occasion (it looks a little pricy), it looks really nice on the other side."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night, had high expectations for this place. The octopus was burnt, the shishito peppers were bland, pork belly sauce was not good. Would not come back. Also club soda was served as sparkling water, you think they would have bottles of sparkling water (I.e. S Pellegrino)."}
{"text":"Updated 6/30/17: Today was our second time at Estrellon. We gave Estrellon five stars the first time we were here and tonight again we are giving them five stars again. Every dish was wonderful and the staff was wonderful as well. Very highly recommend."}
{"text":"Everyone, stop what you're doing and get the Basque Cake! It's just wow! We also had the Paella which was great, but the show stopper is the cake. Amazing"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight to celebrate my husband's birthday. He'd heard about the market vegetable paella and had a hankering. The service, as you'd expect, was impeccable. Our sever knew his stuff, and made fine suggestions. This restaurant is likely a better choice for meat eaters. Beyond the marinated olives, I was not a big fan of the food, but the birthday boy was, and that's all I cared about. We both loved the idea of the fried guac, but I could taste pretty much everything else that had been fried in the same oil, and that was not a plus for me. The paella was OK, but not great. I thought it was an example of putting together fine ingredients that just weren't good together. The most grating thing for me was the casio-tone-driven music and the sound of the chairs scraping across the floor. We didn't hate it entirely, but, if it's up to me, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I walked into Estrellon as a staunch atheist. Then I had the Basque cake, and now I'm not so sure. It might have been the best dessert I've ever had, anywhere, and I've eaten at a lot of great restaurants.  The roasted carrots and beets were fantastic, the squash blossoms were great, and the veggie paella was delicious. The service was excellent, with a great wine recommendation, and the ambiance was understated and relaxed. But seriously, just get the fucking Basque cake."}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled into Estrellon on a Sunday evening, and I am so glad we did. It is a beautiful restaurant and the Tapas were amazing. Our favorite tapa was the Grilled Chopped Chicken Liver, but the Summer Sausage was a close second."}
{"text":"Oh Wow. This little place has two sides - a sit down restaurant, and a tapas bar. We opted for the tapas bar (casual as we were) and were not disappointed. The small bites on baguette were incredible. We died for the blood sausage for sure - our favorite. Loved the PB&J with pork smear, jam, and peanuts too. The olives were zesty and warm - love warm olives. Service was very attentive, and the cocktails were perfection indeed. I would hit them up again and again for their food and service."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait!  Estrellon is finally open for business and serving up some amazing cuisine.  The restaurant itself was gorgeous.  Stunning woodwork, fabulous tables, and we loved the view into the open kitchen!  The bar area is completely separate from the restaurant and the perfect spot for after work, pre-show at the Overture, or after dinner drinks.  The tapas bar is in the bar area as well which is fabulous to sit and watch and drool over their wares.  The drinks were delicately hand crafted.  We had the Herbs and the Bees (a blend of gin, yellow chartreuse, lavender honey) and the Monk Melon.  My Tempranillo by the glass was the perfect complement to the food as well.  Most importantly, the food!!  First, if you have any questions on the menu, don't hesitate to ask your server...they perfectly explained anything we threw at them! Prepare to order a lot of plates due to smaller portions, but it's a blast to try so many different things!  Pan con Tomate was a great easy starter (fresh crushed tomatoes on toasted bread), the heirloom tomatoes were the most amazing fresh local tomatoes prepared simply with EVOO and a dusting of delicious flavors, the charred beets are served atop a crisped baguette, and the mortadella was as excellent as you'd expect from a Spanish restaurant.  We absolutely loved the seared padron peppers that were sprinkled with sea salt and the dragon tongue beans were out of this world....they are beans I know, but trust me, you need to order them along with the patatas bravas (aoli and red sauce topped frites).  We also had the brisket with chimichurri (don't think of this as a southern BBQ brisket) and the seared scallop with the most amazing fresh corn relish.  The night ended on an amazing high note with dessert.  When our server recited the dessert menu, our table of 5 said yes....we want them ALL!  Best decision we made all night!  Out of this world was the basque cake served with seasonal berries (it's a delicious almond base cake that is perfectly crunchy on the outside while moist and creamy on the inside), their take on a crème brulee, sorbet with fresh berries and, of course, churros served with the most insane drinking chocolate (perfect for dunking!).   We are already planning our return visit for the paella, which looked outstanding at a neighboring table!  Cheers to Tory Miller and his dedicated team for another unique and outstanding addition to Madison!"}
