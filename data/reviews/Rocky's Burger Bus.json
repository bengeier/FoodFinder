{"text":"Ladies and Gentlemen! Painted red in the corner of an expansive gravel lot and weighing in at approximately 30,000 pounds is the undisputed champion of burgers in Calgary......Rocky's Burger Bus!  This converted school bus in an industrial park in the southeast serves up deliciously juicy charred hamburgers, heavenly hand cut French fries, and thick creamy milkshakes at a price that won't KO your bank account.    It may not KO your bank account, but Rocky's Special - which consists of a cheeseburger, fries and a pop costs a mere $8 - will surely knock you out with its freshness and quality.  When you're the undisputed champ, you're bound to have countless fans, and Rocky's Burger Bus is no exception, so expect a little bit of a wait.  And you should probably expect to eat your grub in or on your car, as there's just a few picnic tables available and you've gotta get lucky to snag one for yourself.    Not since the Partridge Family was rollin' in the 70's has a bus been making such sweet, sweet music.  So, if you wanna \"Get Happy\", get to Rocky's Burger Bus!"}
{"text":"What is there to say about Rocky's that has not already been said. The hands down best burger in the city. And the fries are something to be reckoned with.  Great meal worth the drive even when the market is not open."}
{"text":"I've been to Rockies burgers quite a few times. I would recommend trying it at least once.   Their claim to game is their 10 oz burger patties. I can eat a ton of food and I can't finish their special which is a single patty. The double is the size of two m and I can only manage one, so unless you're feeling extra specially ravenous, I'd stick with the single.    The beef is good quality. The patties are made on site. The fries are quite good also. All in all its a super solid place.   The one thing I would change if I was running the place is I would toast the buns by default. Other than that, I've always walked away happy and full."}
{"text":"well after reading the reviews and loving burgers i was close to the area and stopped by on a warm September day for a Rockey special, Burger fries and pop for 9$  Fries were great and flavorful , hot and crisp..... ( will try the onion rings nest but wish there was a smaller option for smaller price) the Burger was juicy, BIG hot and fresh... but it was missing \" something\" it felt like it needed a little \"extra\" in the seasoning... because i was such a thick burger and lots of meat... it did taste a little \"plain\" i added some seasoning salt for the fries and some pepper and it helped. i will be going back next time im in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh meaty burgers, excellent double cooked fries and great gravy.  Come in the summer and enjoy the sounds and smells of the industrial area or in the winter steaming up your windows with juicy goodness, either way just come enjoy a real burger.  If you come on a weekday, try and time your visit before 12 or after 12:30.  The lineups on a nice day can be pretty insane."}
{"text":"There was a lot of type about this burger joint so I decided to give this a try. The burgers were huge but lacked seasoning as it was pretty bland. Very good value for money though. Fries came in big portions as well but very greasy and soggy. Ate outside on a bench but something smelled really bad. Overall an average experience."}
{"text":"Good old Rockys.  I've been coming here since I was a kid because my Dad always worked in the area.  Parking is the only issue because the lot is a little wonky (and they share the lot with DJs) but if u can get a spot then it's well worth the hassle.  The bun, bacon and condiments are pretty much standard but the patties are so thick and juicy it's like you're eating a meatloaf on a bun. I heard the fries and gravy are awesome but I usually only get the burger because its so filling. The price is definitely right at about 6.25 for a cheeseburger.  I don't think it's the best burger in the city but it's definitely a craving about once a month."}
{"text":"Short A unique (huge!), but not great (bland) burger served in an awesome old bus dug into a hillside, with above average fries.  Long Based on the rave reviews here, I ventured south from my office, looking for the fabled Rocky's Burger Bus. What I found was definitely worth a return, but wasn't the 5-star burger experience I was hoping for. As many of the other reviews note, Rocky's burgers are easily an inch thick with a nicely caramelized surface. The middles however are cooked through with and consist of rather crumbly, fairly bland meat. I find the beef at most of the new \"better burger\" places (think 5guys/Smashburger/Clive) brings more beefy flavor to the table.  The soft bun and minimal accompaniments where nice, but the only OK patty overwhelmed the whole thing. To me, a great burger is all about balance, crisp bacon and lettuce, a soft bun, and a toothsome patty all playing off each other. Rocky's is just out of whack. Biting into the smoky bacon underneath gave a some crunch and a little smokey counterpoint to the overwhelming burger patty. But it wasn't quite enough.  Fries were great. In fact, as opposed to some reviews where the fries are sacrificed for the sake of the burger, I found myself putting the burger down after about 2/3 and finishing off the twice fried, hand-cut fries.  Still it's a great deal. A home-made cheese burger and a huge order of fries with a can of Coke can be had for under $10 bucks, so I'll likely find myself back there some time."}
{"text":"Meat-coma here I come.  And totally worth every delicious bite.    It was a pleasant day when a friend took to this quaint little locale and suggested we split a burger.  I wish I wasn't so greedy with food and listened to her advice. The burger was massive, but so tasty I forced the whole thing down along with an order of onion rings.  Mmmmm.  Full.  Sleepy.  Nap now.  Nobody will mind if I lay down at a picnic table and digest?    I can hardly wait to go back and have a poutine.  As we were waiting for our food the gentleman in front got a burger patty on his poutine - not on the menu but I am so doing that next time."}
{"text":"Oh Rocky, you made me another list for burger joint. The bacon cheese burger, OMY! (Oh my yelp!) It must be made from heaven; house made beef patty: juicy and soft inside, well perfectly cook outside; chucky relish, mustard and barbeque sauce inside the bun. Most importantly extra crispy bacon plus melted cheddar cheese on top of the beef patty oh my...... and the portion for the patty definitely fill up my tummy. I'm very glad you moved to Crossroad Market, now I can visit you aging during weekends. Thank you Rocky, your staff was friendly and help full."}
{"text":"As we put in our order today, I looked over at the grill and saw the mega-patties and the fresh cut fries going into the fryer beside it.  Niagara falls started in my mouth.  Ordered the single and poutine with a vanilla shake.  My friends put in their order and we were told about 15 minutes so we went over to the farmer's market beside the bus.  As an aside - picked up 10 super sweet corn at unbelievable price - 5 stars for this undiscovered gem!!  Anyways, back to Rocky's - burgers were really good.  Just good fresh meat with a tiny bit of filler to bind it.  Vanilla shake was really good as well, BUT:  THE POUTINE - UNBELIEVABLY GOOD.  REAL CURDS - yes, REAL CURDS.  Puts the squeak into each bite, and the gravy was just right, not too salty or overpowering.  They also put gravy and curds halfway down this huge take-out container.  For $5, you have to try this, be warned - it may be addictive.    Could not finish it, no way.  But what I did have was amazing.  Good, fresh and decadent.  There are a couple of picnic tables, and a huge grassy area to sit and eat.  On a blue-sky warm Alberta day, can't ask for more.  Just wear sweatpants.  Trust me."}
{"text":"Excellent grub. Giant burger patty, slab bacon, poutiine was glorious.   Outdoor seating is a bit rough but well worth it."}
{"text":"Important lesson learned: Burgers are best served from a bus. When you buy a burger from Rocky's, you just feel so, so...cool! They're located in a fixed location outside *Crossroads Market and they're open for lunch regardless. Rocky's burgers get right to the point, nothing  flashy, just crazy tasty juicy burger with a lot of meat.  It's the burger equivalent to a badass classic Harley Davidson bobber. Given the size of my single burger, a double burger has gotta be one mean meal!  It's the classic diner style burger; the buns are alright, the cheese is nothing to write home about, but that BURGER!   There's a cheeseburger fries and pop combo for $10, or you can go with hot dogs, smokeys, and bacon & egg sandwiches, and onion rings or poutine as your side.  There are no vegan options (the fries, I guess). There are no gluten free options (maybe the poutine?). Apologies given? Zero. It's a burger bus. Come here for a burger and you will get just that - a damn good burger!  There's no place to sit in the bus, but if it's a nice day they have a patio area in the parking lot for you to hang out. If the weather is miserable, you can always just grab your burger to go.  Do yourself a favour and come hungry, you've gotta check out Rocky's Burger Bus!  *Crossroads Market: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/crossroads-market-calgary-2"}
{"text":"Amazing fries, but average burger. Not much flavor in the meat. 2\" thick - more meat than bun. Processed cheese is $1. Would have been nice to see real cheese and more toppings. Five guys makes better burgers in my opinion.   I hate to say that because I really wanted to fall in love with the burgers here, but the lack of flavor in the meat just had me disappointed. It seems this place is more quantity than quality.   That being said the french fries are probably some of the best in the city. They cook them just right so they are crispy and they are fresh made from potatoes that morning. Once you try their fries there is no going back to New York Fries in the Mall Food Court."}
{"text":"Jimmy Buffet immortalized the cheeseburger when he penned his tune about the American classic in paradise. I don't think he had a sunny December day in Calgary AB. in mind when he wrote it. but today (Dec 9) sitting at picnic tables on the hill behind a partially imbedded bus, folks in the \"know\" where dining on burgers ,fries and shakes. It resembled a moment in paradise. Rocky's know burgers and I have to admit  the Bacon cheeseburger is the only item on their limited menu I know. I can't get by it to even bother with breakfast or steamer dogs, I have never had the poutine and do not have the fries or rings , I\"m sure its all excellent but at the home of the meat orgy its hand pattied beef (a single not the double), real cheddar cheese, mustard, onions and a bun for me. The beef is lean and perfectly grilled \"old school\" on the flat top, the toppings and bun are fresh and the bacon cut thick cooked to just crisp without any scorched pork. It truly is deserving to be eaten in paradise but only on occasion. My only suggestion would be Hp sauce, but that is an occasional weakness and can be brought along if necessary. Remember lunch is busy and there is going to be a line."}
{"text":"A rare breed of burger joint!  The place is actually a bus, you walk up and order like you would at a vendor at the fair - the only difference is this food is great and affordable.  Homemade style burgers and a huge amount of fries will definitely satisfy the urge for a quality burger. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The best cheeseburger, fries & gravy in Calgary. Period. I have been enjoying these burgers for years, the extended family used to have a few others in town also mainly in the foothills in the old days, and also make amazing bacon and tomato sandwiches. You definitely leave full from here!"}
{"text":"Let me unbuckle my belt.. that's the biggest patty I've ever eaten. Not the biggest burger, because that would have to include the bun and toppings, but I swear the patty was at least 2 inches thick.   I ordered me a bacon cheese burger from this old bus-turned-grilled and a side of onion rings. I peeked in through the window while I was waiting for my order to see a grill full of patties all the simmering up together. That's a whole lot of meat. Just over ten bones for my meal (no drink). I'll admit Rocky's does a pretty decent burger. I'm not sure it constitutes being #1 on my list of the best burgers, but the place has character and it was a filling lunch at any rate."}
{"text":"Burgers are 100% pure beef! Not paper thin, but so thick that I almost got lock jaw! Fresh toppings to order! Reasonable prices and the best fries with skin on!! Great thick gravy too! Real ice cream milkshakes with creamsicle, and licorice flavours on top of the 3 normal flavours!! The couple who run it are friendly and wonderful! He has been around a long time! Used to be the yellow burger bus awhile ago!! Nothing bad to say gotta try it! Located at crossroads farmer market! But closed Monday's"}
{"text":"A burger served on a bus?!   These guys have been doing the food truck thing long before food trucks were even a thing. While Rocky's may not move around like food trucks do, you can still appreciate the tight space they're trying to work in.  Rocky's has been around for as long as I can remember. Growing up in the city I've driven past countless times but it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I gave them a try. I've been missing out all these years.  The patty is huge. If you stop here at the beginning of the lunch rush you can see the grill loaded up with the thick pucks of chuck. Their fries are also worth mentioning. Nice and crispy. The only thing I would skip are the onion rings. They are probably just using frozen rings as they don't seem to be anything special.  They make everything to order so once you place your order expect to wait a couple of minutes."}
{"text":"This place packs so much awesome into their food, they simply can't stay open more than a few hours per day!  The poutine is the best I've ever had, and the burgers are incredible --made to order and perfectly juicy.  The milkshake was good, but Peter's milkshakes are better.  Thankfully, I live nowhere near Rocky's Burger Bus, because I if I did I would always be eating here.  And since the calories in poutine rivals the redline of a tachometer, my heart thanks me."}
