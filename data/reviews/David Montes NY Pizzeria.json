{"text":"This is my favorite pizza joint in town, i dont know why there are so many bad reviews personaly never had problems my pizza is always yummy and fresh and i get my delivery in about an hour. Keep up the good work David Montes you are my favorite"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.  Ordered through the Eat24 app, got chicken wings, fries, chocolate mousse cake, and carrot cake.  First off, the chocolate cake was not chocolate mousse.  It was, however, freezer burnt to the point that it was crunchy and you could taste more dirty freezer than chocolate.  The carrot cake was obviously frozen and store bought as well, worse quality than you would get from a grocery store bakery.  Pretty much mushy sugar.  The chicken wings were nothing special, the fries also straight out the freezer.  The best part was the food poisoning I got.  The Eat24 representative reached out to the restaurant when I requested and refund and told I was told no refund on the desserts since they're all frozen, and I'd have to bring in a doctors note for a refund on the wings.  Not worth my time for $5.99, but I hope this review was worth it."}
{"text":"I'm giving them a 1 star because if the yelp check in. That's it folks! 

The pizza was SOOooOO hard to chew!! Imagine having dentures and you ran out of Fixodent, then you had to chew a cardboard box. There also was barely any sauce on the pizza! 

The dough must've been prepped from Thanksgiving....

Go to Little Caesar's and get a hot-n-ready!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! Wow, what a great pizza place. Never knew it was right around the corner from me and my family. Kind of hard to notice, but it is right in the corner by the dennys. I ordered 3 large pizzas for my family of 6 and there wasn't a piece of crust left when we finished! I don't know what it was , but the taste was so great! Sooo much better than your big chain pizza places. Definitely will be ordering again and again!! The blonde lady who helped us out was very nice and the service was quick."}
{"text":"I ordered from here because I received a flyer on my door and I have having a taste for a cheese steak. I come from the east coast and it's hard to find a good one here. 

I ordered the lunch special : cheese steak, ff, soda. I LOVE jalape√±os, so I asked for them on it. Well needless to say there were so many on the sandwich it KILLED the taste of the cheese steak.  I think it would have been good if it wasn't killed in the jalapenos. Nothing special about the bread at all. Just your basic roll. Then they didn't give my the French fries. 

I also order mozzarella sticks. Over cooked and extremely small. Marinara sauce was good. 
The lady who checked me out was EXTREMELY  friendly and very nice. A gentleman there also seemed nice as well. 
But I don't think I will be ordering from here again , or I should say I won be ordering these items again.  I don't eat bread often but when I do I enjoy a GOOD bread. They had pizza on display that did look extremely good. I may try their pizza items. But I definitely won't be doing sandwiches or appetizers."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place zero stars worst food place ever! I waited 2 hours to get a burger and when I received it it was cold and in edible! Would definitely never order again even though they refused to give me my money back and gave me a credit instead."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome. Great NY style pizza and wings...you will not be disappointed! If your having a large group of people over, get the big colossal pie. Not only is it  cool to have a pizza that big show up, but its also absolutely delicious. The wings are also amazing. Highly recommended both."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing here, we order quite often. We try a something a little different each time but I always get the ham and cheese calzone! So good!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Always looking forward to trying new places and not one regret from trying it. Really good deal for the amount of food that you receive. I will recommend this place to everyone. I personally would not listen to the bad reviews and give the place a shot. The staff was amazing, it was delivered in a timely manner, and everything was so freshly made when received"}
{"text":"food was good at first, then i started feeling sick.... hhhhmmmm, maybe this is why, fuking mold on the pita bread, or what ever kinda bread it is.... now can't stop throwing up.... then said they'll give me a 10$ credit for digesting mold....  how bout u kiss my ass and check your food.... that shit was expensive, i mean, it had mold in it,  who's working in your kitchen,  what the fuk are u guys thinking.... check photos to see mold."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love the pizza here and the people are friendly, the issue I have is out of 4 orders only 2 were correct. 50% right is not a good track record. 
The 1st time I wanted to add an additional topping on just half the pizza but it was put on the whole pizza. 
The 2nd time I ordered online so all the toppings are right there in black and white, but when I picked up the pizza one topping was missing. I can understand if it was a supreme or had a ton of toppings but I only ordered 4 toppings and only got 3. 
So what did they do? They put the \"missing\" sausage in the oven to heat it up and then tossed it on the pizza. They should have at least put some cheese on it to cook it onto the pizza. Now every time we take a slice the sausage just falls off. 
Like I said, the pizza and personnel are great, but if they can only get an order right  half of the time I'll just go somewhere that can get it right all the time."}
{"text":"So I'm going to start by saying that their pizza really is delicious. That's the reason for the two stars. It's their service that cost them the other three. 

I have ordered from David's three times - one time for a pick up, one time as a dine in, one time as delivery. 

The first time I ordered for pick up, I ordered online and it told me it would be 45 minutes until it was ready. I thought that was extreme as it was a Wednesday late evening - not very busy. I showed up after half an hour and the pizza was already ready and waiting. That was my first experience, which was good. The pizza was delicious so we went back a second time...


The second time, my family and I decided to dine in. There was one customer in front of us that ordered one pizza for dine in as well. We placed our order for two pizzas and some garlic knots and took our seat to wait. It was an hour and a half before we were finally served our pizza. The customer in front of us had to wait over an hour as well. For a pizza!!!! They were doing tons of to go orders that were going out the door, but it took them FOREVER to serve us. Once we did get our pizzas, they were delicious, once again. The manager DID give us a discount for our wait, which prompted us to try them again.... 

This time, I ordered a delivery online. I figured with as long as we had to wait for dine-in, delivery should be faster! When we dined in, many pizzas went out for delivery so I figured we had a better shot. AFTER I completed the order online and paid, it said it was going to be 65 minutes to be delivered. I thought that was a very long time, and really should have had a pre-warning before you pay. But it was too late at that point. I ordered the pizza at 5:44pm.  Fast forward to an hour and forty  minutes later. Literally 7:20pm. Still no show of the pizza. My husband gives them a call to see where the heck our pizza is. The phone rings... and rings... and rings. They don't answer. We, luckily, live not even five minutes from this place, so I literally drive there to see what the problem is. I walk in at 7:40pm. There is not a single customer there. There is one lady at the front, and what looked like her own child there with her who ran back behind the kitchen to her, who came scrambling to the front. I let her know that I had ordered a pizza TWO hours ago and was wondering what happened to it. All she could tell me was that \"he left ten minutes ago, it's getting delivered now.\" No apology. No discount or anything to make up for it. Nothing. 

I really wanted to like this place. Their pizza is phenomenal. Great taste, tasty crust, but the service just kills it for me. I can't bring myself to try this place again. I really wish they would get it together, but I'm sure they'll be out of business soon, unfortunately. No reason it should take that long for a dang pizza!!!! And if it does, they should let you know before hand, call you to give you a heads up, or at very least, answer the damn phone when you call them!!!!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas visting my buddy who goes down here for work. He comes down every few months and supposedly knows all the good places to go, I believe him for the most part but not so much for food. He takes me here to NY Pizza and I am very impressed. This place was really good. Little bit of a wait but turned out to be definetly worth the wait!.
Highly recommended this place! Staff was super nice as well."}
{"text":"Second time I ordered from here. Highly disappointed to put it nicely. 


Ordered... 
Italian cold sub. Nothing but bread can't even taste the slice of meat they put on it. 

Garlic knots. Doughy under cooked absolutely no flavor. 

Cheese sticks are only thing with some taste but frozen. 

Wings. Although u get 12-15 the look like diet wing. Half the meat isn't even on bone. And asked for medium sauce they were plain right out of the fryer no sauce at all. 

It wasn't worth the over hour wait to get the nasty food. And a waste of money."}
{"text":"I love this place for 2 reasons. First and foremost, the food is amazing. We usually get the white pizza for my wife and I, while the kids get calzones. The sauce is incredible and my wife says I talk about it in my sleep. The second reason this place is great is the staff. They're very friendly and attentive. I definitely recommend coming here to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, awesome salad and garlic knots,  brought out of town cousins in and they loved it too!  Chicken kabob dinner is 2 die for!  Good prices"}
{"text":"We've had some problems in the past. I wanted to give it one last chance because the food was really great the first time we had it. I ordered angel hair pasta with meat sauce. 45 minutes later I'm still waiting for my delivery, even though I'm a mile away. I call in, placed on hold for 11 minutes. Luckily it was on its way. It's now over an hour when I get my food and then it was a little warm. Not to mention regular pasta. With hardly any sauce. Really? That's what I waited so long for. I should have just cancelled the order."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find great pizza places as it is. But this place is not only great pizza,  but the service is good too. It's a bonus that it is so close to my house."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery with a bacon burger and the potato skins. I was going to start with the skins but when I opened the delivery box steam hit my face and they were way to hot!! My burger was still warm and quite tasty. My two negatives was that on Eat24 I didn't know what was on the burger (it has onions gross) and it took 45 mins to deliver (less than a mile away). Other than that the food was quite tasty!!"}
{"text":"Order fingers the first time for delivery it took 2 hours to get and it was cold called to tell them well they would give me 20 percent off next order. Well order pizza this time no 20 percent off was late getting it again it was cold called back got an a young lady ask for manager she was not in left my number cause I was upset. No call back from manager. Do not know who is running that place but they are terrible. Do not order from here now me and my husband are both sick from the pizza. Do not order from here . I will be finding another Pizza place to order from.. not good service anymore. Bad place."}
{"text":"Great pizza !! Pizza did taste fresh and was very pleased with the quality not soggy like a few other spots I have tried in vegas"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing, and the prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food they give you. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I haven't seen a lot of people dine in. But we did and she made sure we had everything that we needed. This is definitely one of my favorite spots from now on"}
{"text":"I'm a traveler. I tried pizza in Italy (Roma, Napoli, Sicilia), I tried pizza in Greece, in Turkey, in Egypt...but pizza from David Montes is the best, trust me guys. Crust, amazing tasty, delicious  
And yes, I ordered chicken wings - they look different than at other places and maybe that's why so much tasty.
I'm happy that I live close by and can eat their pizza and appetizers almost every day Lol
Btw, they have moved and now to a different address - 955 W Craig Rd #105"}
{"text":"Well after waiting an hour and 15 minutes I received a delicious calzone and was very pleased. They forgot my husbands wings and fries and they were delivered 4p minutes later. The wings were cold and there were only 7 fries in the container. We called and the employee basically said it was a side item and that was normal. My food was delicious but I am very displeased with the response to late cold food."}
{"text":"Glad to see another business in this spot. I hope they stick around.  We had Chicken wings and a White Chicken and onion pizza. It was very good. The wings were very good. Not fatty or greasy and the honey mustard sauce was very tasty.  The pizza was just OK. The crust was very bland and I would rather have it cooked a little longer. It was a beautiful light brown color, but i would of preferred a crispier crust. My husband thought it was too much garlic but I could of used more garlic.  All in all not a bad visit and we will be back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"First and last time ordering from this place. The food received was cold, plain, and not good. The potato skins had minimal meat and cheese on them and there were only 4 for $10. The bacon cheeseburger did not include fries as indicated by the picture when ordering. The chicken strips were literally slathered in BBQ sauce...the sauce was supposed to be on the side as a replacement to the ranch sauce. The cheesesteak also do not come with fries. I called the restaurant and spoke with a female Sofia or Sofie...she said she was the manager. She apologized but said fries are extra and its policy to toss the chicken strip (not wings, stripes) with sauce. It makes no sense, would they have tossed the stripes in the ranch sauce? I ordered through eat 24 and will NOT be ordering from here again. I asked to speak with the manager and Sofie or Sofia told me \"he doesn't deal with the customers\" she told me that she was the only one that I could speak with. This place of business has MUCH to be desired. She did offer me 20% off my next order but I will not be patronizing this business again. If you order from here...GOOD LUCK!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken fingers, absolutely disgusting and they didn't even through in ranch to stop my first and last bite from choking me! Please save yourself or your kids and order anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I always say just because the name of the restaurant claims \"New York\" doesn't always mean it tastes like it.  Tried this place for the first time and I can say although eatable it won't be a place I order from again. Ordered a large pie with extra cheese and half pepperoni. If this is extra cheese I wonder what their regular amount of cheese is? The garlic bread was tasty but very small. Price point was good but will pass on this place. I'll add a pic if my \"extra cheese\" pizza. I was going to give 2 stars but they didn't burn the pizza and that is always a plus! Delivery was a bit long considering I like 5 minute car ride, had I known I would have picked up not to wait the 1 hour and 15 min. Oh and I think its BS that they charge $1 fee for a credit card transaction. The .50 charge the credit card company charges you could afford to eat as a business owner considering you charge $1.95 for delivery."}
{"text":"We've ordered plenty of times from here; yet tonight marked the last time we would.  My hubby was looking forward to enjoying some baked ziti only to receive it with the top of the container completely smashed in.  So... He called back, reordered, and the same thing happened again!  After a two hour wait in total, my hubby demanded his money back.  Having not eaten and frustrated, he now has to wait until tomorrow to speak to a manager to get refunded."}
{"text":"The pizza we ordered was like card board hard and chewy and the linguini with clams was horrible. The pasta was overcooked and clams had no flavor. I was highly disappointed! I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Zero stars.  This establishment delivers the wrong pizza and wants the pizza back!  Do not order from this establishment!  It took over an hour to get the pizza from an online order.  Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"So disappointing! The spinach pizza on thin crust had zero seasoning, tasted like canned spinach and the crust was soggy. The garlic white sauce was nonexistent and there was no fresh garlic on it at all. Great promotion, bad pizza. You guys will have to make better pizza to get me ever to try it again!"}
{"text":"We enjoy this pizzeria! It's our favorite place. We no longer go to Pizza Hut and Papa Johns because David's is way better! I'm from the East Coast and this is the best pizza I have had in the west! 

The only thing I don't like is that sometimes on arrival my food has been cold.

I frequently order through GrubHub"}
{"text":"The worst ever.  Awful,awful, awful, spaghetti and meatballs were horrid, watery sauce, frozen meatballs, definitely frozen not homemade,  spaghetti tastes like it was made days ago and warm Sauce poured on it. We got tons of sauce and maybe what would be a 1/2 order, 3 teeny meatballs, funny the garlic knots were nice, hot, and soft! Oh I almost forgot the flat coke!  Horrible 1st impression,  you should be ashamed of your self. If you are going to serve Italian, learn to cook it 1st. I will never order from you again. Would rather drive across town to Broadway!"}
{"text":"Pizza was raw. Lady on the phone argued with me and then had the nerve to ask if we wanted a new one......DUH. Poppers were Luke warm at best. Pizza not cut through to which the girl states they aren't allowed to cut it all the way through. 46 minutes new pizza. Still raw. Spoke with driver and informed him the lady I spoke with was very rude. He said he doesn't know what's wrk g with the manager she had made several mistakes already tonight. I gave him that pizza and said just give us a refund. I doubt we will see the refund"}
{"text":"They gave me black rotted lettuce and I got sick do not eat here"}
{"text":"Amazing! We've only tried once, but so far we're impressed. We ordered the special with 2 topping xl pizza and buffalo chicken fingers. The food tasted great and was delivered on time. So happy they deliver on our area. Will definitely be ordering from them adhering!"}
{"text":"I DONT know where these restaurant delivery drivers think it's freaky ok. To sit my order on the hot dirty ground while they get the receipt together. I don't care if my food is in the delivery bag. And let's  not mention bugs also crawl on the ground where he had the nerve to sit my order. When I asked the driver about this practice he ignored my question. And the vegetarian pizza was a 1 and driver was 1. So that's why a 2. Call the store like I did when the Pizza Hut driver did the same thing. Hell no. I. Just wont order from either place again."}
{"text":"Really great marinara sauce. Calzone was amazing. Sausage sandwich was to die for. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"It's gonna be a hard no for me, captain. Ordered garlic parm wings, they came crispy but SOAKED in oil. The box the wings came it had at least a half cup of oil sitting in the bottom. Flavor was decent, but the coating of oil threw us off for suuuuure. Pizza looked bomb as hell, but the cheese was super tough? I question the word tough because I wouldn't know how else to explain it. Typically, cheese pulls when you take a slice, right? Not this shit. It broke apart like a puzzle. Idk man. I hate to be like \"stay away from this place,\" because it's someone's business and they've worked hard to be where they are. But when it comes to someone like who is wanting a dank ass pizza and wings, I've gotta be honest. Stay away from this place unless you're cool with mediocre at best pizza. Sorry, guys. Oh, and they forgot the ranch we paid three bucks for. Delivery driver had the SHITTIEST attitude when he brought it back to us. Don't bother."}
{"text":"I wanted to try someplace new, and I'm glad I picked this place despite the poor reviews.  I ordered delivery, it came quickly, and the delivery man was kind and courteous. The garlic knots are fantastic! The pizza was good, not the best I've ever had, but not bad either. I would go back here just for the garlic knots though. I was very pleased with my experience."}
{"text":"Worst customer service!! They completely messed up our order on Mothers Day and offered a 20% discount for our next order.  How convenient it was the next time I called they had no record of that.  Save yourself a head ache and order from an established chain or at least a business with some customer service.  Other chains at least show some integrity and do what is right!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza.  We've ordered more than a handful of times already and each time its been consistent and yummy.  This time our family decided to try the 28\" pizza.... what were we thinking?!  Lol. It's HUGE. Delivery is a little longer than other pizza spots but probably because it takes time to make amazing pizza.  We will continue to order from here. Garlic knots are pretty good here as well as their wings. Thanks!  Pizza delivery lady was nice tonight as well."}
{"text":"Amazing Mediterranian food inside a pizza parlor!  Tender Chicken kabobs with rice, pita, wonderful salad. Good price great taste!  Going again! Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place but its hit rock bottom. I waited 30 min for a slice of pizza and a few wings. People who came to dine in had priority over me. Their soda machine is done which is cool but she still charged me for a soda knowing the machine is broken. Then, poured me flat soda from a bottle. Everyone is running around and there is no organization. The poor guy who does the pizza does everything else too. The worse part were soggy wings and stale pizza 33minuets later. I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I was feeling lazy again after a long week of work, so we decided to cruise around grub hub and see if anything catches our eye.   We all wanted different stuff, so David Montes was a good fit.
We ordered a small cheese pizza, Stromboli, and cheeseburger w fries.  And for dessert a tiramisu cake slice.   Everything was pretty yummy.   We were gonna order pasta but didn't know if the pasta was just gonna be heated cans, but the sauce that came with Stromboli and the pizza sauce was very good.  So definitely pasta next time.
The only couple of things was that the driver forgot our burger and had to go get it, but whatever it was hot when it arrived and mistakes happen.    
The tiramisu was blah though, kinda tasted like refrigerator.  :/
Overall pretty tasty, especially with a $.95 delivery fee."}
{"text":"As a New York native, living in Vegas for the past 3 years, i have not been able to find a decent pizzeria, let alone NY Pizza...until now!

Zero stars.  This establishment delivers the wrong pizza and wants the pizza back!  Do not order from this establishment!  It took over an hour to get the pizza from an online order.  Terrible customer service.

No no no don't waste your money"}
{"text":"It was ok but just ok. I wouldn't order from here again but that may be caused my taste for pizza and pasta differs from others. 
 I ordered the Ziti and small Hawaiian pizza. To me the pasta and meatballs had that frozen taste. Sauce was very watered down. Bottom of my pizza was really soggy, and nothing really popped taste wise. 
 If you're looking for something to just feed yourself with in a hurry then go for it. If you're looking for flavor and something that stands out don't waste your money."}
{"text":"After making our last review, I received a message from the management and was pleased to see that they were very apologetic and willing to make the complete order right. That shows great customer service. 

Setting the time for seven pm, the delivery was on time tonight in fact it was ten minutes early. Upon delivery the guy who brought our food expressed how sorry they were for our past experience and hopes that we will continue to order thru them :) very sweet guy. The food was hot and bursting with it's fresh aroma of the pasta with meat sauce. 

We got the same thing on our order : mozzarella cheese sticks , chefs salad , and a pasta with meat sauce. 
-The chef salad was good as usual really no complaints there. It's a perfect size for two. 
-The mozzarella cheese stick are delicious. They came very fresh and slightly crispy still which is hard to get when ordering them for delivery. ( the only complaint tonight was that there still wasn't enough marinara sauce for all six sticks) 
-the pasta was on point today, not dry one bit and the sauce tasting fresh and not to garlicky (I love garlic but not much tonight's pasta had just enough) . It was very delicious and as a bonus we were happy that the pasta came with garlic bread (something we didn't get in our last order) 

All in all great customer service and good food. Glad they went above and beyond to make our last experience right. We  definitely will be order from David Montes New York  Pizzeria the next time we are craving pasta"}
{"text":"Love their food!  I got the chicken & beef kebab. And it was fresh and delicious.  Took a few minutes, but it was well worth the wait.  Can't wait to try the lamb!"}
{"text":"My food came nice and hot still fresh... only thing they forgot my dinner rolls and extra ranch ..."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and wings one night, thought I'd give it a try. Wings HORRIBLE. Pizza wasn't that bad, I actually liked it........... That is until I found a huge HAIR baked in my pizza! Gross. NOPE, never again."}
{"text":"I only order certain items from there because I am Italian and they  make the best calzones. I ordered on Saturday for the whole family at a cost of $52. I paid $2 extra for each of the 3 calzones I ordered for extra mozzarella and Ricotta cheese. The calzones were burnt and the cheese was minimal. You are probably wondering why I didn't call the restaurant and complain and that's because the man who manages/owns it (I'm not sure which) is very nasty. I know this because I use to order a lot when they were on Ann and Simmons and I had a few mishaps with orders . I don't know if they got a new chef or what, but the food was better when they were on Ann and Simmons. That use to be our go to for calzones but after Saturday I'm not that sure. I will give credit when its due and my husband said his BBQ chicken salad was very good."}
{"text":"Place was almost empty on the Sunday we went which was nice with kids in tow, got two small pizzas with mozzarella sticks and some spaghetti noodles for lunch that was more that enough for me and the three kids. Cheese pizza was average but mine with peppers and beef was awesome with great Italian seasoning flavors. Nice little hole in the wall kind of place and the staff was kind considering my noisy kids and general disheveled and distracted demeanor."}
{"text":"I ordered from here because I wanted to try something different even though some of the reviews were bad. The food came faster than the estimated time and it was hot. I had honey barbecue chicken wings which were excellent. The spaghetti and meatballs was just ok. I liked the spaghetti but didn't care much for the meatballs. I think I'll try the pizza next time. I'm a senior citizen and I find it irritating that the minimum for delivery $10 but so many menu items are 9.99 which forces me to order something else that I don't really want, which is the main reason I gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"They don't answer their phone! Called on three separate occasions and it just rang through. Way to run a business. First goal should be to accept calls to take an order.  Owner should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast this is no where shape or form New York Pizza
No no no don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Have ordered from this place many times and the food is usually hot and good this time however it was almost 2 hours for delivery and the food was cold and tasteless"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken avacado salad on grubhub at a tad bit past one and was quoted it should arrive between 220-230 it is 2:58pm and still haven't received my order called the restaurant and was told I can't get ahold of the driver shouldn't take him longer than 5 minutes to arrive . Pretty disappointing service my first time ordering and more likely will be my last now ."}
{"text":"My household loves the hand tossed pizza from this place. When thinking of calling it an easy night we call up place our order without a 15 minute wait like most places. We always order for pick up and when we get there its practically right on time. I will say however I got a text about a meal deal and it offered free potato skins with an order of $10 or more and I was not impressed with the potato skins. I think if they were smaller potatoes with the same amount of chrese and bacon then they may have been amazing."}
{"text":"I do not understand how anyone could give this place more than one star. Wanted to try someplace new and they had a deal. Placed our order and took a seat in an empty dining room at 730 on a Friday nite should have known better. Server brought over two flat cokes and left. The knots we ordered were made ahead and improperly reheated. Parts of them were cold and parts were hot. The pizza arrived two seconds behind the knots. WTH! Can I at least get into my appetizer before my entree arrives? The pizza crust tasted chewey like it had been sandbagged and reheated too. The flat Cokes we sent back finally arrive and didn't come from a fountain but from 2 liters. Some idiot was smoking in the bathroom and the placed smelled of smoke. My daughter was so hungry I didn't send it back and at at this point we just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place for dinner that delivered. The online delivery service was easy to use and comes with a coupon code \"free\" for free delivery. The estimated time was 65 mins for the order to be delivered. I ordered the chicken wings, sampler appetizer and cheesecake for a grand total of $35. 

The delivery guy seemed nice and delivered the food in 30 mins. Wings were very delicious. Sampler was average. And cheesecake is ok. I only recommend this place if you want to try something new and don't want to cook. It's descent food. Not the best but not nasty."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst places I've ever had, I don't recommend anyone ordering from here."}
{"text":"Ordered a Calzone  and the baked ziti. Boyfriend was quite happy with his calzone. I found my ziti lacking flavor and cheese. The bread that came with my ziti was burnt. 
I'll try them again one more time. 

I tried to give them a second chance. I called and placed a $30 order. When I went to redeem the %15 off coupon offered through yelp the woman on the phone refused. She didn't know how to use the coupon so I explained that delivery drivers usually confirm the coupon and click \"used\". She still refused to honor the coupon. I then told her that due to her actions she her business has lost me as a customer and to cancel my order. 
I won't go back."}
{"text":"We love their pizza, just the right thickness of crust, and their kabobs are pretty freaking good. Everything fairly priced, we are repeat customers and will keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"I stopped in on my way from work for a Calzone and it was amazing! I like all of the vegetarian options of toppings you can put in the Calzone (spinach, bell peppers, mushrooms, black olives, onions, and tomatoes) . The outside was crisp enough to hold up against the veggies I had inside. The red sauce that came with the calzone was good as well. I am not a fan of sweet tomato sauce (think one of the chain pizza delivery places). Their sauce is more tangy and perfect for dipping. 

Lastly, I LOVE French fries and order fries most of the time even if it doesn't go with my meal. Their fries were nice and crispy (I asked for them to be crispy) and good enough to skip the ketchup. 

Their portions are a good size, so you will either be full or have leftovers. I will definitely be back.

The only negative is I called from work and we have over 100 employees and my receipt had pre-populated the name of someone else at my site. No biggie."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and excellent! They had many different types of wine and the owner informed us that they were expanding to have over 300 different types. The restaurant is also being made into a lounge and I look forward to going again. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a good pizza and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My daughter had spaghetti and loved it. Sauce was just tart enough without being overly sweet. I had an Italian Supreme calzone. It was large and savory and not overcooked.  Perfect. Next time I'm in the area, I will absolutely be back. Took some spaghetti back to my Italian mother. She says it was just like her mother used to make. I agree."}
{"text":"Their pizza is the best tasting ny style pizza . They have a jumbo size the doesn't fit in small cars. Their garlic knots are a must with any size pizza. Not sure about their sandwiches I haven't had one yet."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner for 2 adults and 2 kids through Eat24. They delivered in about the exact time given. We had the California BBQ chicken salad, it's a big salad with a generous amount of avocado, everything was good. The BBQ sauce tasted similar to Sweet Baby Rays sauce you buy in store. We also ordered the chicken BLT. Loved how the the bacon is minced. It was delicious. I didn't get a picture, my husband devoured it. We also got two HUGE slices of cheese pizza. We barely got to try the pizza, the kids loved it. 
We would definitely order this again.
Thanks! 
4 Stars for the price, quality and time. My kids give it 10!"}
{"text":"This place is close to our house so we go here often. We have always had spectacular customer service and the food is delicious!  They just added in Mediterranean food too, which is also good."}
{"text":"So, I made a pretty big mistake by spending almost $30 on food, delivery and tax here. I decided to partake in the $20 for $30 yelp deal because the reviews left me curious. I ordered a medium pepperoni and mushroom pizza, 5 fingers, garlic knots, an order of mozzarella sticks, as well as chocolate cake. First of all, I called this business as soon as they \"opened\" and it took them 20 minutes to finally answer my call. 

After ordering, I waited well over an hour to receive food from this restaurant literally located less than 3 miles away!!! I would have been better off packing up my infant son and taking the 40 minute walk. 

Now, about the \"food\"..........

Pizza - would you like some COLD pizza with that grease!? 
Fingers - ordered them buffalo BUT received plain fingers, also would you like some chicken with that grease!?
Garlic knots - HARD!!!!!!! COLD!!!!!!! Disgusting.
Mozzarella sticks - Again, HARD, COLD, tasteless and disgusting.
Chocolate cake - more frosting than cake but it was OK at best.

Save your money and go elsewhere, this restaurant is listed as \"montes pizza\" at the same address on yelp. I wish I would have realized this before purchasing. They don't even deserve a star. I had a terrible experience and I WONT be back!"}
{"text":"We used to love to eat their pizza and garlic knots. Not sure what has happened over the last couple of years but last time we bought garlic knots (dozen) they had been microwaved and literally impossible to eat. We threw them away. I called to discuss it and was met with, \"oh okay.\" No offer to replace them. Today we bought $40 worth of food and when I was given the bag with wings we had 2 tiny cups of ranch. I asked for 3 cups of blue cheese and was charged $2.44 for these tiny things. I think we will be sticking with Broadway from now on. Sorry David Monte's your slacking."}
{"text":"Authentic New York Pizza with a Vegas Upgrade

My Las Vegas friends know that I am a snobby and skeptical New Yorker, so of course that's why they insisted on taking me out to eat at David Montes NY Pizzeria, so I could criticize it and complain that the pizza was nothing like \"real\" NY pizza.  Well, I am writing this review to publicly eat my words.  David Montes NY Pizza is even more authentic than some of my favorite NYC places.   

We ordered a TWENTY EIGHT INCH!!!!! round pizza that was overflowing with pepperoni and sausage.  Honestly, as a New Yorker I thought I had seen everything, but I have never seen a pizza that huge. The crust was perfectly crispy, the sauce and seasonings were authentic Italian and the overall presentation was very nice.  Good service too.  I noticed that they have delivery service...I wonder if they would come to my place in NYC, lol.  Yummy, mouth still watering..."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Pizza was like a burnt cracker with maybe 10 pepperoni and we got the huge one. Very rude staff if any acknowledge you at all. Not our first time at this place the last one was delivered soggy and cold. I lived in ny and this is absolutely nothing like ny pizza...I wouldn't even call it pizza at all for that matter. We chucked the last one pretty much and will not go back. It is proving to be a nightmare to find anyone here that knows how to make a decent pizza."}
{"text":"I dont think their pizza is that bad.  They dont put much sauce on it.  For some reason my wife becomes violently ill whenever we eat this pizza... maybe its just her."}
{"text":"Gross. Delivery was on time. Fries were good. Chicken fingers are fritters not chicken fingers and are over cooked and taste like they sat in old oil that wasn't the right temp. Ewwww! Pizza was OK but nothing special the sauce could use some oregano or something. So now it's late and I'm hungry...  Very disappointed..."}
{"text":"I don't know what I have been thinking always going to Marco's with this pizza gem right down the way. Always drive past here but never been. my parents decided on this place a few days ago and man oh man I fell in love instantly. great ingredients and great people. the pizza is hot and fresh when received. I definitely recommend this place if you are a pizza lover. the prices are not bad either. they have a special right now for large one topping for $7.95 carry out only. large is 8 slices and I can eat about three and I'm stuffed."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible! If Yelp had an option for zero stars that is what this establishment would receive! Customer service is horrible and unreasonable. I order a pizza online and the wrong pizza was delivered in a little over an hour time. When I called to ask them to pick up the wrong order the owner refused to pick up or refund me. Save yourself the headache and hassle of this establishment and order from somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This is more a review of their issues. First off they have rude obnoxious jerkoffs dropping menus at homes. Second their phone doesn't work so you can call and complain. 
Even if place had best food ever this is enough disgust for me to never try it!"}
{"text":"After we finally find good pizza.....ordered online tonight at 1825.......it was supposed to be delivered.....now 2035 and I'm sitting in front of the store and I'm told the pizza will be another 10 minutes........the lady at the desk states that she will at least give me my money back......love the food but sorry....you just lost a customer this evening.......never again!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for the first time. From the east coast so I like a real good calzone. Ordered a buffalo chicken calzone and mozzarella sticks. The calzone was pretty good taste wise but was honestly the size of a quesadilla and maybe got three pieces of chicken. Three pieces of chicken being three little cubes of chicken. The delivery time was pretty good, but when my calzone got here I had to put it in the oven because it was still so doughy and undercooked. Gonna probably try it again because everything else out here sucks but that might be it.


Just ordered from here again and I will absolutely never go back. It took an hour and a half to get my order that was wrong, soggy, and cold. All set."}
{"text":"First time in this place. Very good service no not very good it was great service.  Rosie was our server and she was great. Most of all the spaghetti with meat sauce was very good. Better than Macaroni Grill. Thank you for the great food and service."}
{"text":"This place has delicious pasta and burgers. The home delivery is always fast and efficient and the person is always kind and courteous. We have ordered here a few times and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that we've ordered from here a few times before and we've never had an issue, however, we've always picked up the pizza, never had delivery before. I order online for the first time and set it up for delivery. When I finished, the email said it would be a 65 minute wait. Well being pregnant and very hungry, I did not want to wait. I called the store and asked if I could pick it up instead because I live close by. The young girl on the phone said that it would be fine to pick it up and it would be 25 minutes. We arrived about 20 minutes later to pick it up and we were informed that it was already out for delivery. We were a little frustrated but said okay. We made it home in about 3 minutes and the pizza had not yet arrived. I called the store and she informed me that the driver had one other delivery and that he'd be there soon. I waited another 15 minutes and called the store again. I spoke with a man and he made contact with the driver and said it would be 5 minutes. The driver did show up 5 minutes later with a pizza. Well, we also ordered garlic knots, garlic bread, fingers and fries!! The driver had no idea that he was supposed to get the other stuff. I immediately called the store and the young woman said, \"yea, the other food is here\". What the?? I had already called 2 times and not once did they say that the other food was left behind. So this has now been over an hour since we ordered and all our food wasn't even delivered. The girl put the man back on the phone and I tried to explain the situation, the male pig decided to tell me, \"before you even talk, listen to me...\". Are you kidding me? My husband then got upset and told the driver to forget the whole thing. I hung up on the jerk on the phone and that was it. I never got an apology or a phone call back trying to keep my business. I am absolutely appalled by the service we received. No one seemed to care. So here I am, many hours later, still hungry."}
{"text":"We used their mobile app to place our order: Lg 2-topping and chicken wings w/ honey bbq sauce and ranch. The order arrives with no sauce on the wings at all. The ranch was there, though, so we called to inquire about the missing sauce. The guy who answered the phone insists we ordered plain wings. We suggest to him that there may be something wrong with their mobile app because we know we selected honey bbq sauce, yet he continued to blame us. We weren't looking for anything free or a future discount or anything. We simply wanted the sauce we requested with our order, but he didn't want to even consider that the app may have had a blip and make it right; he was only interested in blaming the customer. We definitely won't be back. The pizza is mediocre, at best, and the chicken wings are a mixture of full sized wings and party wings (we had 3 full size wings in our order)."}
{"text":"Love the Spanish Philly cheese steak it tastes really good, so far this is the tastiest Philly I had.
Thanks for a good service"}
