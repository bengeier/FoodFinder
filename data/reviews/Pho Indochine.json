{"text":"I was very impressed with this Vietnamese/Thai fusion restaurant.

While offering the standard Vietnamese selection of pho and vermicelli. 
I was most impressed with their inclusion of a grilled fish dish, served with cucumber salad and cold rice noodles.

And surprised that their tea was made with whole leaves and very fragrant."}
{"text":"solid pho. solid service. solid addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This is a cute place tucked away on Parliament. Highly recommend their grilled basa filet with vermicelli and spicy tomato pho. 

Also I know it sounds weird, but you have to try their mango flavored creme brulee. It's so cheap and it's delicious"}
{"text":"This place serves the worst pho I've ever had. Nothing upsets me more than bad pho. So you can imagine my rage after I found out that the only pho place within walking distance to me SUCKS. 

Appearances are deceiving. The owners obviously spent a shitload of money on decor and design, but that matters fuck all when you can't even pull together a decent bowl of pho. They would have benefitted from saving their money on the stupid fancy door handle shaped like a bunch of ivy and more on hiring competent Vietnamese chefs.

First of all, the only cuts of beef they have for pho is medium rare. No flank, no brisket, no tripe, no tendon -- none of the good shit that comes in a traditional bowl of pho. 

Second of all, the broth is watery and tasteless. Anyone who knows good pho knows that everything is in the broth. I don't know what these people think they're doing, but the broth at this place is extremely bland. 

If you're craving a good bowl of pho, it's worth it to make the trip to Old Chinatown at Gerrard and Dundas where there are at least three pho places that can pull a better bowl of pho out of their ass than this place can serve.

Or just go to Under the Table underneath this restaurant, which serves some great comfort meals (especially the oxtail with 'slaw)."}
{"text":"Great price range. 
Good food (lots of different Vietnamese food options - not just pho here). 
Nice, clean and quiet. 
Suitable for lunches, after work, dinner with family. 

Try the fish dish."}
