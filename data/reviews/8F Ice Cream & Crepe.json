{"text":"Went here with a group of friends at night. I got the Nutella banana crepe which was huge and super filling.The crepes are made to order so they are super fresh. Only issue was that the crepes were made one at a time, so by the time one person received a crepe another person had already finished their crepe.  Despite this, the crepe was tasty and I recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I don't want to go below 3 stars, but the Thai ice cream rolls were pretty bad. I ordered Oreos as a topping- I literally got one Oreo. One Oreo on the side... And it was sort of tasteless"}
{"text":"Watching how your ice cream is made in front of your eye was very entertaining!  I think it would also help if they had a tip can for those who are working hard to make your ice cream."}
{"text":"Like others have stated, it is pricey but you are paying more for the labor of making the food and the experience of watching it being made. The quality can't be beat, and I've been known to come in a bit more often than I should for the Sweet Thailand with raspberry and coconut flakes."}
{"text":"The concept is great - I like the presentation of the ice cream rolls...I almost didn't want to eat it because it was so pretty..... but the ice cream is so frozen that you basically have to mush/mash everything together so that you can get some onto your spoon.  It's kind of like Cold Stone Creamery (you pick your ice cream base flavor, then choose your mix-ins, then choose toppings then you watch them make the ice cream) but with better presentation.   The ice cream itself was ok, but it isn't something that I would venture into campus town to specifically have.   The crepes looked interesting --- maybe next time."}
{"text":"Crepes are amazing! Like biting into clouds. Ice cream rolls are also really good. One of their chefs, Johnny, is a magician when creating your bowl."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today. Wanted to try dessert at a new place and this didn't disappoint. The seating area is nice. Dimly lit compared to the usual ice cream places. I had the Thai ice cream rolls and they were pretty good. Only wish they weren't stringent on toppings. You get a choice of two toppings with your standard order and I could count the number of chocolate chips on my finger tips. The smoothies and crepes looked appetizing would visit again to try those next!"}
{"text":"We were in town for welcome week and think we visited during one of its first days open.   I've never had Thai ice cream rolls before but I have to say that I am a massive fan. We ordered the one with Oreos and Graham crackers and watched the guy masterfully and diligently prepare it on the iced metallic surface. It was mesmerizing to watch. They are also very generous with the fillings so it was very decadent and filled with chunks of oreo. We were skeptical of the consistency but found it to be very smooth and rich!!   I would definitely frequent this place if there was one like it in Chicago!!"}
{"text":"Ahhh so good, i even dare to say better than the one on Buford Hwy in my hometown! I got the oreo+graham cracker mixed ice cream with mocha and oreo topping and my only complaint is that they didn't give me quite enough to fit its container! Came on a Friday night, so I was surprised that business wasn't better, but then again...it was the weekend before thanksgiving so perhaps most of the students were gone.  But yes, the ice cream is definitely richer and had a fuller flavor than any others I've had previously! I wonder if it's the same company...or they copied the name? What are the chances that there are many 8F Taiwanese ice cream places? o.O  UPDATE: came in again on Tuesday afternoon, still delicious and rich, but still missing a roll :("}
{"text":"You only need to come here once.  Although it was semi entertaining to watch them roll my ice cream, I had to wait over 10 minutes and it was $6 for a cup! It does not taste any different than normal ice cream, it's harder to eat because it is so much tougher, and it is much colder than normal ice cream. Was overall disappointed and would rather go to Coldstone across the street next time."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of make-your-own ice cream places. I believe 8F was just recently opened, within the past year or so. I usually order the rolled ice cream when I come here; and you can watch it be rolled around and made! (Similar to places like 10-Below in NYC.) There are also has pretty tasty crepes in a variety of flavors. My only criticism is that everything is a bit pricey, but overall I recommend 8F, especially for desserts."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It used to be Koto Ramen, but now makes crepes and Thai Ice Cream rolls. I have not had the crepes yet, but the Thai Ice Cream rolls and the fresh juices are THE BOMB.   The atmosphere is really quite cute, and you can watch the staff make your ice cream rolls for you which is awesome. Their staff is all really friendly, and the little tables are adorable. I love anything lychee, and to see them put an actual lychee into my Thai ice cream was a treat for me. The rolls are beautiful, and the portion is really decent for the price.   The owner, Joe, often works and makes ice cream along-side his staff, and he's there almost every day. That's dedication if anything. I'm a regular at this place!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. After seeing friends' hype about the rolled ice cream craze, I thought it was pretty cool that we got our own place on campus. However to our dismay the actual ice cream rolls were kind of disappointing. For six bucks there was a lot of empty space in the cup and the rolls were kind of tiny, very skimpy on the toppings as well. It was a cool experience watching them make it but probably would not come back just for the rolls."}
{"text":"I came into 8F for a snack, so I got the Nutella crepe and liked it. It was runny as water, and made a huge mess, but the crepe was good, and the strawberries were fresh. Plus, even runny Nutella is still great."}
{"text":"So good! I came here the day after it opened and it was so yummy. Theres a few different creations and you can add two free toppings. I want to try the crepes and more next time."}
{"text":"Review for crepes: this is the worst place for crepes ever! I didn't think you could mess up on crepes... I ordered a strawberry Nutella crepe and it was horrible. 1) There was barely any Nutella. They melt down the Nutella so it's really runny. So their Nutella isn't even true Nutella. Nutella is supposed to be thick, rich, and chocolatey. The girl essentially put like a teaspoon of runny Nutella. 2) There were barely any strawberries. I basically paid close to $5.00 for thin dough... Also, when I asked for more Nutella, the guy was really rude. He said \"that's just how it is.\" I was simply asking for a normal amount. Anyway, don't order crepes from here. And if you want to be treated kindly, don't come here. I've been to over 20 crepe places from Denver to Orlando to NY and I have never had a bad crepe except for here. I hope they improve their crepes- because they're gluten free and that's a big plus for me."}
{"text":"It is good. I liked the idea of making icecream in front of you. But the test was ok, not great. I think compare to the size of ice cream it is pricy."}
