{"text":"Best Gelato outside of Italy!!!  Every time I return from Italy I search in vain for that same all natural, creamy but light, refreshing, full of flavour Gelato...until a few weeks ago!  I came upon Bar Freddo at Sherway Gardens.  Since that day I have returned a dozen times for Gelato.  My favourite flavours are Amarena (black cherry....so good!), and Bacio.  I just can't get enough of this stuff.  It reminds me of strolling down any cobbled street in Rome or Capri.  The owner even uses the Effe machine (the original Italian Gelato making machine) to produce his made from scratch Gelato.  The pizza that Bar Freddo sells is made daily by a guy from a small town outside of Rome.  To die for pizza with a thin crust and the best tomato sauce.  Oh and you can have a beer or a glass of wine with your pizza, or veal sandwich.  Still can't get over that it is in a Food Court.  The food is so un-food-courty."}
{"text":"Excellent Veal on a bun, and great pizza slices, in the Sherway Gardens food court!

Decent prices and great quality ingredients."}
{"text":"The go to spot when you need a beer if you get the shopping mall blues. Not really sure why their kitchen and food service area is at the back where no one can see it. Since their food is actually pretty good (when paired with the $5 pint specials) they cook in front of you which is nothing new in a food court type environment. But the selection is very health and gourmet conscious. 


UPDATE: food moved to the front for better traffic. Good job!"}
{"text":"This is a cafeteria style eatery in the new Sherway food court upstairs in the new section of the mall.  

Bar Freddo seems to have \"nicer\" seating just to the side of the counter instead of the general public regular seating.  All the trays they serve are the same no matter where you eat in the food court however.

While they had a variety of pizza, pasta and other Italian type food I just wanted a quick slice to tide me over until dinner.

The slice was 4 bucks and I asked for a Blood Orange San Pellegrino and after tax it came out to about 7 bucks. 

The pizza while I didn't have cutlery seemed almost impossible to eat by picking it up.  There was so much sauce on the pizza the toppings were practically lubricated and were sliding all over the place.  It was hard to eat without a fork because it was simply too slippery to pick up.  

They had asked if I wanted the slice cut in half but I didn't think to say yes.  Typically I don't necessarily go to Italian places because I eat that type of food often.  As far as a snack for the food court it's decent for a slice if you just wanted something small."}
{"text":"Love the Nutella mocha latte!!!
Amazing!!

Just wish you guys had bananas for a banana Nutella pizza :(
I've checked 3 times and they're never there."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay, not great, tried it twice. 
Slices are small. 
Prices are high. 
Nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place! The pizzas are always made fresh and use fresh ingredients. I'm by no means a vegetarian, but always order the veg pizza slices - in fact, it's the only time I will order veg over meat. Very tasty. The lasagna is a hefty meal that is quite filling. I have a few favourite gelato's as well; hazelnut, coconut, dolce de leche are all a good way to top off the meal. The staff are all personable and efficient. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Had the spaghetti sauce with meatballs. It was good.  Needed a bit of salt but still good. Manager offered me a dessert on the house. Nutella pizza yummy!"}
{"text":"Sherway's attempt at being fancy. But overpriced, small portioned, microwave quality pasta, with bland flavors doesn't exactly do it for me. They have beer though, I guess that's good right? Overall it's a pasta place for people unfamiliar with pasta."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Gelato...everything is made from scratch with fresh ingredients.  Try the Limone...you will not be disappointed.  Five Stars all the way!!!"}
{"text":"lots of options here, but I made a bee-line for one thing and one thing only. 
pasta. 
lots and lots and lots of pasta. 
Carb heaven 
oh my 
on a more serious note, I was really craving pasta without having to go through the effort to make it at home, so I went with some rigatoni with sausage and was not disappointed. rather then sit down and wait to be called up, I actually watched the process, they stick the pasta in a fryer that cooks the pasta to al dente in 2 minutes or so, then they transfer the pasta to a frying pan, add the sauce, peppers and sausage and cook until everything is nice and piping hot. I really cant wait to come back and try more options on the menu, the only thing holding me back is the parking lot, which is painful to get in and out of. 

lots of parking, as this is at a mall, but drivers here are nuts so keep your guard up. 

transit options are the 15, 80, and 123(B,C,D) with some Mississauga options as well."}
