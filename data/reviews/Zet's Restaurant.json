{"text":"I am not a typical diner client, but this place rocks. Got the Zets burger and I had no problem hoovering that up. Fresh made patties on a kaiser. Best burger I have ever had. If I am in the area again, it will be a no brainer to stop in."}
{"text":"This is our favourite Greek food in the GTA.  We don't get to go too often since we live about 30 mins away but we are never disappointed and are always looking forward to the next visit.  

We enjoy the pork or chicken slouvaki dinners, burgers, and Greek salad. The taziki sauce is the best we've had but be warned about the garlic lol!  Portion sizes are huge so be sure to come hungry. 

Payment is cash only but there is an ATM on site if you need it.  The place is 24 hours, 7 days a week except for holidays.  Parking can be hard to find depending on when you visit.  A very popular local spot."}
{"text":"Good portion of food and selection. Price is great for the food portion you get. The service is consistent as well. This is my go to place after the gym for some protein"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been going here for over 10 years. Only issue is I found a very old piece of carrot/cabbage  in my Greek salad. Needless to say I have never gone back for the Greek salad. Their steaks are the best!! Souvlaki, fries, steak on a bun, cheeseburgerare all delicious.  Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Now coming in, I expected huge portions based on all the reviews. Was not disappointed. 

Got their chicken souvlaki since most people suggested it. Delicious, and left me very full. It comes with big pieces of chicken, salad, rice, and potatoes. Would definitely come back again to try their burgers. 

Also, it is cash only."}
{"text":"If you see me with cash... that could only mean one thing.. I am making a trip down to Zets! What I love about them the most? Their PORTIONS! Oh man. When I go out to eat, I am always thinking to myself, will that fill me up? or should I order more. That is not a problem for me here at all. I know for a fact I will be leaving satisfied. I either get the chicken souvlaki dinner with rice and potatoes, or sometimes change it up and just get all rice OR get the 6oz chicken breast dinner with the same sides. I did try the 12oz chicken breast dinner once, thinking I could finish it since I do have a big appetite for someone small, AND even though I did finish it ...eventually, I was super full for the rest of the night so I decided to stick with the smaller portion for next time. 

The food is always fresh and that you can be sure of since it is made right in front of you. There has never been a time that I have come in and there was no line up. This place is always busy but you get your food pretty fast. Another plus is they are open 24h! So if you get a midnight craving, you know a place that will be open!!! It is right by the airport too so if you have a late flight going or coming back, you can drop by for some really good Greek food. 
The prices are reasonable, given the amount of food you are getting, and you can dine in or have it for take out. There are plenty of tables if you do decide to dine in, but I usually just take it to go since its not too far of a drive. 

Just remember to bring cash! Or you can use the ATMs they have. Hopefully they eventually start using debit/credit soon."}
{"text":"ordered a 10oz steak med rare..it was cooked perfectly HOWEVER did not taste good at all...I wonder if they even seasoned it as it was very bland. Portions are quite big and the salad was great but the fries were quite soggy. If I do come back here again I will def not be ordering a steak"}
{"text":"Fast food style, expensive, terrible ambiance. Don't let the price fool you into thinking it is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours, huge portions, decent prices ($10-20). NO COMPLAINTS. 
I used to rave about Peters on Eglinton - I'm sorry to say, but this is 100% times better. Get the chicken souvlaki. It's very tender, unlike the pork souvlaki at Peters. It's also a lot cheaper.

My boyfriend got the pork on a bun, it was good but I think he will go with the chicken on a bun instead because it's very very soft. A friend of mine got a burger and poutine. He had no complaints about the poutine. He said the burger was delicious but there were better places in town for a burger.

I'm a sucker for portions so this is why I love this place. The chicken souvlaki includes a (huge) side of greek salad, tzaziki sauce, fries, a bun & the chicken.

Burger - Not the best in town
Poutine - satisfactory
Pork on a bun - solid but not great
Chicken souvlaki - best thing I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Been going here since July 2008 when I was on my way to a Star Trek Convention that used to be down by the Airport after a friend recommended it. I've gotten a handful of people into this place. Incredible food and great portions. A little pricey, but when you taste it and see the portions you'll be glad you went. You've tried the rest. Now try Zet's. Cash only."}
{"text":"Great value, for $95 we fed 6 people and still had lots to take home. Serving size was monstrous to say the least. 

Chicken souvlaki was a bit dry. Peameal on a kaiser was tasty and very filling. Bacon burger was on point and onion rings were fairly filling and tasty. The hot beef is so big you can share although the gravy was a bit salty for our liking. Fries are always a classic go to here. Will come again. 

Cash only establishment with ATM on site. Self serve tables and service is always fairly fast. Have never seen this place at less than 75% capacity, from 2am to 2pm, doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Portions are big big big!  Many places will advertise big portions but when you get there, all you get are big portions of things you don't like.  Like lots of rice, potatoes, veggies etc.  Here, the size of the pork is the size of my knuckles.  I think you get about 5 really really big pieces in the pork dinner. 

The size of the 10oz steak was pretty decent as well.  Again, with some places, they advertise 10oz but after cooking, it looks like the piece of meat when on a instant diet.  This is not the case here, meat was big.  

Taste wise, could've been better.  But got to caught up when i saw the amount of food I'm entitled too.

Price wise, not that bad. Not the cheapest but definitely not expensive.  You definitely get more than you pay for. 

Will i come back... yes.  Need to get my hands on their burgers.  Looked like the size of my head."}
{"text":"The food here is solid for those late night grabs with buddies. However customer service was among the worst I've had. I understand since they are open late they must deal with a lot of annoying, drunk customers so maybe they're on edge. But I was with my family, being polite and the men making the food were extremely rude. It's a shame that since they have a steady flow of customers they decide they can be pricks, knowing they still make their money.

I didn't expect service like I'm at The Keg, but it was pretty ridiculous how they treat their customers. I've never been back and probably won't."}
{"text":"Do you like big portions? Do like pre cooked food? How about only paying cash? Or even zero hand washing while handling your food??? Well then this place is for you. Me and my husband went here hoping to find something amazing because of all the great reviews. Let's be honest everyone.. This is not that great. I wonder how many people have gotten sick from this place? It's really sad that a restaurant that's so very successful couldn't invest in a debit machine but would rather invest in subpar food/cleanliness. Well all these things will catch up to them as its only a matter of time. Please be advised sometimes things are what I they seem. If it looks rank it probably is. The reason for one star is because of shear obligation and manners."}
{"text":"Been going to zets for several years now. The food quality isn't how it used to be. It's the only 24hrs greasy spoon in the west end. So this is everyone's go to spot after hours."}
{"text":"If your hungry this is the place for you. The portions are very generous. They're open late and have amazing Greek salad dinners. Whatever I'm in the area and feeling hungry this is a great place to stop in for food."}
{"text":"Greek food done well. Portions are very generous. The souvlaki dinners are a must try"}
{"text":"Love this place i'm a regular and the service is great! Fun people to make jokes with and good at conversation. The food is amazing i love it and the portion is great! Really worth it. Just wish they would have a debit machine but its no big deal"}
{"text":"My steak and eggs looked exactly the same as their picture on their menu, no wait, I only got one tomato slice instead of two.

Got a coffee, 6oz steak and 2 eggs with toast, home fries, and sauteed onions and some lettuce with a slice of tomato. Coffee and water was serve yourself, grab your own jams, pepper, napkins, etc. Cash only. $26 for my steak and eggs, my partner's sausage and eggs, and two coffees."}
{"text":"If you want a greasy spoon that offers huge portions at a good price this is it!  The food is not over the top but certainly a great value.  I've eaten here many a time on red eye shifts between flights."}
{"text":"Steak was too dry salad was all dressing & gross worse than any thing very rude people they it's a cash only and my order was 50$ Canadian and girl was charging me  55american $ and telling me that's how much I have to pay and she canceled my order later manager came and confirmed its 45 not 55 American $ no apology still rude"}
{"text":"ouvert 24 heures. la nourriture est fraiche. les portions de viande sont Ã©normes.  les salades sont delicieuses."}
{"text":"The food is ok, its not that spectacular  but the serving is definitely huge.
The service was fast, there was a huge line up on a friday night but we didn't have to wait that long. The place is decent, it has a family feel to it. 
I guess I'll come back to Zet's if I'm dead hungry and craving for Souvlaki."}
{"text":"I went to Zet's with a coworker a few weeks ago for the first time.  WOW!  There burgers are super juicy and very flavorful.  I've already been there a few more times since then and their food is just amazing.  (Not the healthiest, but tasty without doubt!)  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes burgers and breakfasts and the works."}
{"text":"Great place for a late night out! i love that they are open 24 hours. The time that i went was around 11 pm at night on a weeknight and was shocked at how busy it was, given the time. The food was great. I had a greek salad with chicken souvlaki. The souvlaki was very tasty and definitely beats out Mr. Greek. Greek salad was good as well. The staff who was making the food was very friendly and made sure each customer was satisfied with their order. I will definitely come back, especially if I'm out late and need a place to go for quick late night dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been going here religiously for 5 years now, and every single time I've gone the food is done exactly the way I want it. The prices are fair, and the portions are massive, be warned.

I highly recommend the Chicken Souvlaki, Chicken Club Sandwich, All Day Breakfast, and even the burgers. Everything here tastes good, It's like being in a candy store.

The chicken is juicy, the pork souvlaki is the best I've ever had because its so juicy and trimmed perfectly.

The pulled pork sandwich is another sure win, but its also massive. Meat is smoked slowly and basted in a nice tangy BBQ sauce.

The poutine here is an average attempt, I wasnt sold, but the fish n chips easily made up for it. A nice beer batter breading and fresh cut fries.

The coleslaw is a real treat, and the greek salad is easily my favourite. Give it a try.

Theres lots of parking and ATM service too. This place serves beer and has 2 TVs that play major sports and news almost all the time. Its consistently busy, and average wait time for food is 10 minutes from ordering to eating. Lots of selections for drinks, and has a decent diet pop collection, which most places dont have.

Lastly, the steak dinners here are FRESH cuts of meat on site, and have 6, 8 and 12oz steak T-bone or striploin style, which come on a salad, with a breakfast or with fries and salad. They cook steak PROPERLY here."}
{"text":"First time 4 of us at Airport Road location.   CGood portions, counter ordering, cash payment only,  quick service and lots of seating.  24-7 if hungry during the night.  That is a plus if out late.  Close to the airport.  Paying cash keeps credit card fees away and price down....just a thought."}
{"text":"Food is great. Why only 3 stars?

Price is steep and cash only... Atm charges a fee to withdraw cash. 

They have a good location across from the airport but there are a couple restaurants similar and not too far away where you can get the same quality and size of dish for a much lower price.

If there prices were about $3/4 lower for the dinner size plates and they accepted at least debit they would be a 5."}
{"text":"food tastes great but eating area is so dirty. there is a lot of turnaround and unfortunately diners don't always clean up after themselves.  i  wished i had packed some wetnaps to wipe down my table when i was there."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. Killer fries. Incredible souvlaki. I can't say enough about this little gem. Best food in Malton/airport."}
{"text":"$18 for chicken suvlaki and dry as ever, not recommended


Salad was whatever, expensive and not edible"}
{"text":"This place is great, especially if you're hungry. 

Portions are huge. So much that it takes two of us to finish their signature souvlaki platter. A buddy of mine had the burger and was equally satisfied. The only complaint about food was that the souvlaki was slightly dry. 

Other than the food, the atmosphere is what you'd expect. A lot of late night club-goers but there's plenty of space to be seated.

There's way too many people working behind the counter, but as long as the food is served no one really cares how much they're chatting it up. 

I take away a star for accepting cash-only but add another for them being open 24 hours. 

Overall, satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food, quick service, and well-sized portions. What more can you want?

The atmosphere could use an upgrade as the restaurant feels as if it's been around for at least 20-30 years, although  I'm sure older patrons appreciate the fact that the locale has remained the same. Despite this, don't judge a book by its cover! The restaurant is open 24 hours which means it's the one-stop place for delicious food at any time of day. Fully recommended!"}
{"text":"Good: The portions are HUGE, price is fair, open 24/7 and the service is really quick. 

Meh: The quality isn't that great. My chicken souvlaki was dry. They only take cash. The service is acceptable and efficient. The lineup is usually backed up to the entrance so I can see why they rush some customers. You may not get many smiles from the workers but they're not exactly being rude either. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. It's only good for when I'm hungry at 2am and I'm lazy to cook."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place tonight! I had the chicken souvlaki dinner and my boyfriend had a burger and poutine. Portions are extremely large! We both had a bunch of leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Food was so delicious. I loved the Greek salad, it was cheesy and I loved the dressing. My boyfriend said it was one of the best burgers he has had. Can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Probably 5 stars for the food, but it's against my moral code to give 5 stars to a place that does not accept credit card. What is this, the 90's?

Yes the prices are low like the 90's and the portions feed 2. 

Sticking to my code, however addictive the food is."}
{"text":"this place is awesome. lots of room to sit. there is a large selection of food to choose from. I really enjoyed my gyros. It doesnt take any cards, so 4 stars instead of 5. Open 24 hours I think... not sure. But it was open pretty late hahahaha. 

will definitely come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Portion sizes are huge -1 plate can feed 2 people if not more. I have to remember to just order one meal and share next time. Atmosphere is almost like a cafeteria/ diner as you have to order, pay (cash only) and get your food and find a table with a monstrous heavy plate and tray! Food is great though. Souvlaki, a variety of steaks and pulled pork sandwiches seems to be peoples favourites."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Fast service and great food. We have tried a few Greek Restaurants in our day and this one is right there at the top. 
Very large portions not only on our gyros but on everyone's plate that we saw.  They also serve breakfast all day. 
Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon in Feb. 12 degrees outside so its packed inside. Still tables for everyone. Awesome selection. Everything fresh as can be. Breakfast all day. 2 thick cuts peameal, 2 eggs, home fries and toast $9.95. Stuffed chicken pita $8.50, Zeta burger (2 patties, cheese and bacon) $9.95. Huge portions. Bring cash though, it's all they accept."}
{"text":"Great good, large portions, and nice workers. Unfortunately, they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Better greek food than on the Danforth in Greek town! Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here once in a while when I worked in the Airport Corp Centre.  Can be an ok place to go if you are really hungry and have a fat wallet.  Also if you are on a diet then you should only go on a \"cheat day.\"  Did I just say that?  Omg, Im turning into Richard Simmons.  Omg again, did I just say that?  I am so aging myself...  Seriously though, not a bad greasy spoon..."}
{"text":"I rediscovered this place several months ago when my flight was continually delayed, including another delay alert from the airline, on my way to YYZ.  Thus, a dinner was called for and it was time to revisit Zet's.

There's typically a long line-up during the lunch and dinner rush, but it moves quickly.  Depending on who you get behind the counter, they may not exactly be friendly, but they're efficient.  You place your order, and then move along to the left as they call out your order, and you tell them how you want to customize your burgers, etc.  Usually one of us waits in line, so as not to crowd the area, while the rest of us nab a table, get napkins, etc.  Note that they have plastic tumblers and iced water to the right of the cashier counter, which you can help yourself to.

On our most recent visit (when not rushing to a flight), we went after the lunch rush and I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki dinner.  They never blink an eye when I request no olives for my salad, and no rice  or no potatoes (depending on my mood).  I love that they do not make a big deal.  This time, I ordered no rice and no potatoes, and got a MOUNTAIN high amount of salad with my chicken.  In fact, it was so difficult to eat without spilling everything onto my tray that I had to get a take-out container to remove half the salad before I attacked my meal.  And sure enough, half the chicken also went home with me in said take-out container!  Their portions are generous.

My BF ordered the lunch soup and sandwich special, which was beef barley and a grilled cheese with bacon!  The combo was $7.95, an excellent deal!  

Their tzatziki is killer good.  You get a generous portion when you eat-in (comes with the chicken souvlaki dinner) but the take-out portion is much smaller in a tiny plastic cup.  Not sure why the disproportionate amount.  It's as thick as cream cheese, and loaded with garlic.  They charge $1 for extra tzatziki, which I usually order now if ordering take-out, since I know the container is tiny.

Since rediscovering Zet's, we've been back many times.  I love the mixed crowd who comes to Zet's - airport grounds crew (still in their safety vests);  business people (ties / suits);  young or old of every colour;  even politicians;  and I've seen police officers either dining in or picking up takeout.

Anyway, back to that fateful visit due to my delayed flight...when I got into my seat on the plane, my seat mate started speaking to me and asked me a question.  I actually covered my mouth, excused myself for my garlic breath, and offered him a mint, and popped two into my mouth, before answering his question!"}
{"text":"If you've ever lived in Mississauga you have eaten at Zets, either late at night with your friends or with your grandparents in the early afternoon for early dinner.
The parking lot is treacherous,the staff gruff and the interior even gruffer. However do not let the parking lot and cafeteria like interior stop you. The souvlaki is flavourful and moist, the tazitki full of garlic and flavour. But don't think this is a one stop shop, they have steaks, fish, veal etc. 
if you are looking for a fancy sit down this is not for you, but if you are looking for good food and you don't mind a little noise this is your place.
Bring your appetites, and remember to grab a take out container for the left overs."}
{"text":"Love it here!  We usually order chicken souvlaki and/or steak meals.  Have never been disappointed in quality or quantity.  Portions are huge, chicken is super moist, steak is flavourful, all sides are equally made well and the prices extremely reasonable.  The lines can be long but says a lot about how popular this place is.  There's good seating but we have had times when it was busy we would just do take out. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is busy!  WOW.  We went to go watch the planes landing and departing from Pearson, just for fun.  And....we got hungry.  Despite it being somewhat late, this place was packed.  Orders were taken quickly, and food churned out.  Portion sizes are big, and people seem overall quite satisfied with the food they received.   We enjoyed our food, and the overwhelming garlic breath from the Tzazki sauce too....  I would go back; it was worth the money."}
{"text":"We got the pork souvlaki dinner and also the chicken souvlaki dinner. The rice and potatoes were amazing but the most important part of the meal, the meat, were overcooked. Both the pork and chicken were dry, and hard to cut/bite into."}
{"text":"I was looking for a spot to grab some breakfast with a friend who had a layover here at YYZ. I found this place through Chowhound, my second foodie news home. I was a little concerned at first about the place since it sounded more like a cafeteria instead of a diner but I gave it a shot anyways since it was so close to Pearson. 

It's supposedly a popular spot with airport personnel but while I was there I saw all kinds of people including truckers and businessmen who might have worked in the area. My friend and I had breakfast, which I believe is served all day, that included 2 eggs, home fries, buttered toast, your choice of bacon/ham/sausage, and coffee for the great low price of $5.99. I thought it was a steal with the amount of food we got. Pretty standard fare for a greasy spoon diner. 

If your in the area and need a spot to grab food before or after a flight this isn't a bad option, and it is open 24hrs."}
{"text":"Had Zet's for the first time the other day. I ordered a Cheese burger and fries, and it was honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had! Has huge portions so definitely go on an empty stomach or if you want a big meal. Definitely going to be one of my new best kept secrets, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Right by the airport.  EXCELLENT food.  The Souvlaki plate is HUGE.  Definitely a meal for 2.  Tried Poutine here too.  First time ever having it and I thought it was pretty good.  Again, first poutine experience so don't judge me if you think it's not that good.  Back to the Souvlaki...it was very flavorful and very filling.   Would like to try a burger or gyro there next time we're in town."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's cash only but the food is tasty and worth the inconvenience. The serving sizes are huge, the prices are good, and the service staff is friendly. I'd recommend the chicken souvlaki, the burgers and the fries."}
{"text":"Plentiful, tasty, inexpensive and open late. I asked for spicy sauce for my gyros (I'm from the States and wanted a sriracha type condiment) and they gave me hot peppers instead. It wasn't what I was looking for but it was a different kind of yum. I'm rating Zet's as inexpensive because even though my gyros plate was about $15 Canadian (which Yelp thinks is moderate), the portion size was such that it easily can be made into two meals."}
{"text":"Epic portion sizes, that are tasty to boot! Got the pulled pork sandwich, which was insanely messy to eat, but totally worth it. Right across from the airport, so was the perfect spot for me to meet a friend during his layover. Bring your appetite and bring cash."}
{"text":"If you like Greek food, this is a must! For the portion sizes, you definitely get a great deal. For $10, two people can share a souvlaki platter and still have leftovers! 

This place has been around since the dawn of time. I'd hear stories of the generation before us where this would be the go-to place to grab a bite to eat after a night of clubbing. It's funny how that still holds true to this day, all these decades later."}
{"text":"Chicken and pork souvlaki dinners are amazing ....and the tatziki is out of this world! FREAKY ZEEK"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Toronto.  Simple. Unpretentious. GREAT good.  Good quality.  The omlets, the chicken, the potatoes.  You can't go wrong.
Bring your cash - no plastic accepted here.  Good thing the prices are super reasonable.
It's great for an early morning, lunch or late night meal.  It's the diner I always wanted in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"We got both soulvaki entrees and man were they HUGE portions. I was able to split it into 2 almost 3 meals.  Everything tasted very good.  The only problem was that both meats were veeeeeerrrrrrrrryyyy dry. The taziki sauce was good and almost saved the dryness of the meats but there just wasn't enough.  It was our first time there so hopefully it was just a fluke.  Besides that everything was good and I will most likely visit once more to see if the meat is really supposed to be that dry.

I forgot to add, they ONLY take cash and also accept american."}
{"text":"Food was great, price is a little high, Over cooked rice with the Slovaki dinner and not the greatest eating area kind of feels like a dungeon. But great spot for a quick late night snack."}
{"text":"Massive delicious portions.  Love the Souvlaki dinner, large enough to share if you don't have a huge appetite.
Decor is lacking but what are you gonna do."}
{"text":"Our first venture to try the much talked about restaurant. The good...the amount of food, quick service and quality .The bad...Well, the alternative to the portions size.
All in all the I was happy with the food but it may not be someone's idea of a Friday night out as you feel like visiting a cafeteria."}
{"text":"Huge portions for a cheap price. Well worth it! We got burgers, t bone steak, and chicken souvlaki dinner. I love that they are open 24 hours. Restaurant was very busy so food was super fresh. Only downside is the interior of the restaurant and that they only take cash."}
{"text":"We decided to take the family there after reading all the great reviews; and we are so happy that we did, cuz we can't wait to go back and try everything else in the menu !

We ordered one of each; pork & chicken souvlaki, as well as the Zeta two patty burger, and shared it between the five of us. The portions are definitely health to say the least! The food was very tasty, fresh & well seasoned. The prices are relative to quantity & quality: souvlaki dinner - $ 13.95 
(Bring Cash)         Double burger - $ 7.95

This diner is very casual with lots of seating, definitely well liked & known. People from all walks of life were coming in to eat, whether it was take- out or dine in, from local business executives to Airport Imployees, to families and out of towners etc..

If I had to pick one thing as far as what they could improve on, would be to invest alittle in the washrooms, perhaps some fresh paint & new ceiling fans. But like I said earlier, we can't wait to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Holy. Fucking. Shit. 

I wish someone warned me and my diet about the serving sizes here. No wonder it's all men inside the restaurant. The souvlaki dish is enough food to feed a small family, and the steak dish is equally as large. I can never, ever finish a plate from there so I'd suggest if you're a woman on the tinier side you'd get one to share. It really sucks that they don't take any cards, so come with cash... but I mean, it's an old school diner so it adds to the feel... I guess. 

As for the quality of the food, it's delicious. It will put you to sleep though; literally the souvlaki is huge and at one point I actually got tired of chewing. It's a great late night spot though; especially if your ravished and want a heap of good food without the fuss. I'll go back.... and share my plate."}
{"text":"Huge serving...1 plate is good for two people..they're open 24/7 too...dont mind driving all the way there for that kinda food..only accepts cash though..but they have atm machine so worry not..better than krazy gyro, wally's, or jimmy thegreek but about the same as peter's of eglington."}
{"text":"Decided to venture out from the downtown core and try this place. Was pretty busy when we arrived. Felt a little out of place because it looked like the restaurant was full of airport/'sauga locals. Ordered famous chicken souvlaki, cheeseburger and a small poutine. The chicken souvlaki was a huge portion. Chicken was moist and the tzatziki was freshly made. Burger was a good size, wasn't dry, bun was toasted, overall a tasty burger. Poutine was standard, although they used shredded cheese instead of cheese curds. The line was long but they were pretty efficient and we didn't have to wait too long. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yes the portions are big and they have a diverse menu. 

I've had their chicken souvlaki dinner and chicken on a pita, and their meat is very dry. I noticed that when I looked over the counter, they had already cooked the meats, and they just reheat it on the grill, that's why it doesn't take a long time. 

People have better standards for yourself, you're so easily fooled by the portions they throw at you you can't realise that the quality is shit, and it's not like it's dirt cheap either. The pita sandwich was $8+tax, and that's how much it'll cost at a lot of places. 

Also, the chicken souvlaki, is just grilled chicken breast...it's not souvlaki style...you can't add tzatziki  and say it's Greek. 

DON'T PRECOOK YOUR MEAT AND YOU'LL BE GREAT!"}
{"text":"I woke up at 3:30 am since I had a tough time getting to sleep over the past few days and found that Zets is open 24 hours. I drove from the east end of Scarborough to the Airport. 

I have to tell you this place is so busy. 

I ordered the famous chicken souvlaki with a side of coleslaw and fries. These guys can process orders at a quick pace and not skip a beat. This is the BEST DAMN SOUVLAKI. PERIOD. 

5 stars all the way. I will be back again. 

God bless this INSTITUITION."}
{"text":"Large portions, delicious meals, well marinated.  Large pieces of potatoes were a bit bland but edible. Needs a bit more flavor. It's more of a fast food setup than a diner. You order, pickup and grab a table. I'm guessing the 24 hours is what qualifies it to be a diner.  Plenty of space to sit. Cash only is a drawback. Having an ATM is not a solution especially when it charges $2 in addition to what your bank charges. It's located in an area right next to the airport which means a lot of international business travelers with no cash. That's a bit of a let down. I'd say the two stars lost are for the fair potato and payment options."}
{"text":"This was the closest breakfast joint near the hotel that we stayed at. If we came here on the first day, I probably would have had a majority of my meals here. The meals are large, and they are reasonably priced.

We came in, and ordered breakfast at the counter. Coffee was self serve, which is interesting, since I haven't had to do that at a restaurant before. As soon as the chefs are done cooking, they place the food on the counter for you to pick up. You are then left alone to enjoy your food.

Besides the self serve, the place is cash only. Both of our meals was under CA$20. I would definitely come back again for the breakfast, and try out the Mediterranean options in the future."}
{"text":"Most of the food here is decent, grilled in front of you and made to order. I consider this place pricey IF it's for a daily meal for someone who eats out daily who is not well-off. Once or twice a week is ok for most people. And I'm referring to the big meals, the souvlaki dinners, not a burger meal. The burgers are nothing special but the souvlaki meals are the thing to get here. Value for those is good as you will either be absolutely stuffed or have enough leftover for another meal. Breakfast is overpriced compared to every other similar type of establishment. The place is 24hrs so it's a great late night place. No tipping or cleanup required. Take your tray, sit, eat, leave. Service depends on who's at the cash. One of the young guys is cocky and loud. The guys who serve the food are cool. I'd avoid the washrooms if possible"}
{"text":"Great all day all night diner near the airport. Big portions. Juicy meat."}
{"text":"Cash only, they have an ATM. They will take USD. Your change will be Canadian.

Walking in, it looks like a your typical coney island / diner. Then menu is mostly Greek fare, breakfast, burgers, and meat-and-potatoes. Nothing unexpected.

After contemplating the dinner, I ended up just ordering the gyro on a pita with everything on it. Even that was too much for me to eat. The meat was just a bit overcooked and on the edge of too dry to eat, but it was delicious and if you like dry, thick tzatziki sauce, that was great. Personally, I would've preferred the sauce be slightly more runny and chunkier, but that's just what I like.

A pork souvlaki dinner went out just before my order was up and I couldn't believe how large the portions were. The skewer had four large chunks of pork (had to be close to 2# of meat altogether) on top of a bed of rice and potatoes (and maybe other stuff, but I couldn't get past the size of the pork chunks). That one meal could easily feed my family.

Overall, you get an extreme amount of food for relatively sane prices. I'd definitely go back, but I'd watch the meal size a bit better."}
{"text":"Great greasy diner food with huge portions and reasonable prices ($7-$15 on average I'd say). I ordered scrambled eggs with chicken souvlaki (not on the menu but in place of steak and eggs) and it came out fast and furious. 

However, there was an unpleasant amount of oil on the plate. It also came with a measly 2 lettuce leaves and one slice of tomato... But I didn't mind because I was in the mood for something greasy. With that said, eggs were fluffy, home fries were well seasoned and chicken was moist. Food cost me $16.90. Great value. 

The table also ordered pancakes and a club sandwich with fries. Fries were a bit too salty for my liking but HUGE portions. We couldn't finish most of our plates!

Bottles of water are 600mL as opposed to 500 which is minor but still appreciated that. 

I also asked for a cup of water and didn't get it - maybe it's self serve? Direction on that would have been appreciated. 

The lines can seem a little long but they move fast, though the line area can get quite cramped up against the area with the condiments, milk and sugar for coffee, and plasticware. 

Lots of Parking and close to the airport - makes it a great alternative to airport food before a flight or while waiting to pick someone up.

NOTE: this place is cash only and they have an ATM on site."}
{"text":"Place was packed and had a good vibe.  Long line to order, but it moved fast.  Chicken souvlaki dinner was good, and nice to be able to have a Steam Whistle to accompany it.  Cash only, so was not able to order any extras, but probably just as well because the portions are big.  Will need to go back and try a burger and the beef dinner."}
{"text":"A real gem in the most unexpected of places!

We came here for lunch while attending a conference at The International Centre. We'd had enough fast food by the third day of the conference so I turned to my trusty Yelp app for advice. Zet's popped up, so off we went.

I ordered the gyro on a pita. It was AMAZING. My only little criticism was that I prefer my tzatziki thicker and more garlicky. Other that that, it was near perfection.

The next time I'm in the area, you can bet I will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent place, Good food, Never closes, It's a must for people who like Greek food."}
{"text":"This is an Etobicoke/Mississauga institution. As previous Yelpers have noted, the crowd here is as diverse as Toronto is. Young students, suit and tie businessmen, airport workers, and your average Joe just looking for some late night grub. 

This is a 24-hour cash only joint. There is an ATM located in the back corner near the restrooms. 

I usually order some sort of Greek-dish (souvlaki dinner or pita wrap). The food is fast, their service line is efficient and effective. Lineups move quick, there is a decent amount of parking. 

Pork souvalki dinner is delicious. Comes with all the fixins. Get extra tzatiki!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 30 years now and it never disappoints. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are always good. The only down side it that it is cash only but do have a private ATM in the restaurant."}
{"text":"For the amount of food at its pricepoint, it's definitely worth the visit. The service was fast and the restaurant is well kept and very clean."}
{"text":"Where do I start, I love this place! 24 hour place in the GTA is amazingly convenient. The portions are huge. If your a newbie try the 8 oz homestyle burger. It's my favorite. Also the chicken Souvlaki is juicy and the tatziki sauce is home made. Just remember it's cash only."}
{"text":"The staff is super sweet and accommodating, and the food is great! I shared with my sister, we got the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner (chicken on the side because I'm vegetarian) and an additional small salad to share, and two of us struggled to finish all that food. 

would definitely recommend this place to anyone craving some Greek food!"}
{"text":"Great food. Chicken Souvlaki is awesome. Cafeteria style but it all works great.  Definitely the best food around YYZ. Cash only but there's a ATM on site."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love souvlaki and who can resist a good deal?! I shared a gyros pita sandwich and it was enough for the both of us! The total for the pita and a bottle of pop after taxes was around $11. Seriously! For two people. The meat was juicy and just the right amount of saltiness. I find that way too many places over season their meat, but Zet's has got it down to a science! It's also close to the airport so if you're looking for some entertainment after your meal, airplane watching is always a fun pastime."}
{"text":"Had the Pork Souvlaki on a bun and a separate Greek Salad. While the service was very fast it comes with a price - precooked food just warmed up. The pork was very dry and a few of the pieces were so hard and dry it was impossible to chew, I just spit it out. Not very good Souvlaki at all. While the lettuce was fresh in my Greek Salad I was surprised that it was just lettuce with some tomatoes and olives. How is that a Greek Salad? No cucumbers or onions at all. Basically just a salad with some crumbled feta cheese on top.  Prices aren't very competitive but you do get a lot of very dry, inedible food so maybe it is worth it. And if you do drop by, make sure you have cash - no credit/debit cards here. Of course, I would recommend just driving past and going somewhere else to avoid the bad experience."}
{"text":"I think this place needs a little better marketing with the sign saying they are famous for steaks but the menu is mainly Greek. I had the chicken dinner and man those potatoes are heaven. The large salad had yummy kalamata olives and tons of feta. This is the best place in the area from what I can tell."}
{"text":"Okkkkkk! So I've been living in Brampton for god knows how many years and have obviously travelled.  Every time I pass by the airport I always see this place SO BUSY. Lines are always out the door etc. 

Last night my friends and I were craving dogs of the hot aka hot dog. 

We decided to hit Zets really late and I got myself a cheese burger. It was the biggest burger I've ever seen. I ended up eating the whole thing. Proud of myself. Thank you. 

Anyway, I know it's just the simple cheese burger but what's so special about it. Well the meat was very filling and had many different flavours. The toppings were fresh - pretty much eating a garden. 

So so good. They should open another restaurant.

I would get the cheese burger again."}
{"text":"Big Huge Portions!

Well if you want a big portion meal, then you would not be disappointed. You can enjoy this any time as its 24 hours. Make sure you have cash as they do not take plastic but they do have an atm on site.

I got their fish fried sandwich and Poutine fries. Over all the best thing was the portions were huge was the price point but the food is ok."}
{"text":"Classic, simple Greek diner food. If there is a science of this type of diner, these guys are PhDs.

Portions are massive and prices are very reasonable. You won't find anything fancy here, only simple quality diner fare. They go through meat faster than your average butcher on a Saturday morning.

They missed a star because, while their tzatziki is as good as Nonna's, their souvlaki is precooked and it therefore quite dry. Stick to the burgers, steak and peameal and you can't go wrong. A must try for anyone near the airport, guaranteed to satisfy the most ravenous traveler."}
{"text":"Hands down best pork souvlaki dinner.  

Restaurant has been around a long time but recently renovated.  Tons of room to sit and very clean.  

I ordered the famous pork souvlaki dinner and was extremely satisfied.  The portion of pork is very big.  It comes with extremely delicious garlic sauce, rice, potatoes, and Greek salad.  

Everything was prepared right and served up quickly."}
{"text":"Great little diner with lots of seats near the airport, making it a convenient place for a bite after a late flight. There's always a lineup here but you get your food relatively quickly. 

As others have said, it's cash only and portions are big, so expect to share or take some home.  Chicken souvlaki ($13) is great here, I normally do not eat much of the rice but here it's delicious. I like their souvlaki over their generic burger. 

In general the prices are not particularly cheap here but absolutely worth it as a late night munchie."}
{"text":"My mouth was left wanting more...

Delicious. Flavourful. A must try if you're ever in the Toronto Airport area"}
{"text":"If in the Airport area this is a must. Talk about a great portion. Please stop and have the Burger. It is so fresh you can still see the ground in the patty. My colleague had the chicken souvlaki. Pricing is reasonable, parking is monitored due to the high volume of customers. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"The  hotel we are staying at is not far so we decided to give it a try. Not disappointed, I have never seen so much food you certainly get your money's worth & didn't have to wait long. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Zets is just that..a Name that has been a institution on Airport Rd for  years. The old  days were  better. Now OVERPRICED breakfast is greasy it has turned into a cafeteria style establishment."}
{"text":"Massive portions, amazing food, fast service and great prices. Open 24hrs, this is a perfect place to go any time of the day. With the amount of options they have, you will never get sick of this place."}
{"text":"Went for a late night bite and had an awesome experience. At 12am the line was long, but the kitchen whipped out the food fast! 

Prices were fair, huge portions and good quality food
Dining area quite clean
Open 24hrs
Very nice casual diner
Food was delicious 
Staff friendly and entertaining 

The only downside was cash only. 

I give it 5 stars for everything I wanted for a late night bite. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat early Saturday morning and most of the places were closed. We happened to see Zets on the road and decided to stop by. What a great decision. Had the pork souvlaki sandwich and it was more than filling! I'm definitely coming back to try their well loved chicken plate next time around. If you're in the area, stop and take a chance. If you can call it that."}
{"text":"This is a go to place which I have been frequenting for a long time as I used to work in the airlilne industry - this place is next to the airport.  I agree with all the positive reviews but nobody mentioned the Pemeal Bacon on a Bun!  You have got to try this delicious sandwich.  3 slices of pemeal goodness.  You can definitely turn this into 2 meals because of the size.  I never do so and end up eating all of it in one sitting.  If I have this for breakfast I end up skipping lunch as I'm still full!
Enjoy."}
{"text":"All I can say is if you're looking for late night protein. And only late night protein, this is the place to go. There's not a lot of options cause everything's pretty much just meat this meat that. You'll see many body builders here. The price for the portions you get are unbelievable low. I was stoked that 13$ got me an extra large plate of pork souvlaki which is a meal for 3 on it's own.

Go here for late night protein at a great low price"}
{"text":"The steak is too die for!!! I ordered it well done but it was cooked to perfection. Not too dry and not too rare. The service was pretty gruff, but the Man taking my order was friendly enough to let me borrow their phone; since mine had died. Really nice cozy atmosphere, huge portions!"}
{"text":"Portions are big but worth it. Food was fantastic:) love the tzaziki sauce! Delicious"}
{"text":"A late night favourite for many northern Etobicoke residents, zets is a 24hr diner that specializes in grilling meat and all day breakfast. Their portions are large but I wouldn't call them generous considering the price, you're looking at around $20 per person if you get a drink but it's not a huge gouge as you will usually get bread and side salad included with your entree as well. They usually take five to ten to prepare an order but things can get crazy during busy times with lines that go out the door. Overall a good spot once and a while and a must for late night munchies or after bar twilight meals. I personally love the chicken souvlaki."}
{"text":"Quick review: Showed up for breakfast around 9am, and I have to agree with all, that the portions are huge 
the breakfast itself was decent, I actually did not expect any customer service, but happy to report that the service was friendly, and polite 

Cash only but ATM on site"}
{"text":"Chicken Souvlaki Dinner was pretty good. Although the rice needs more flavour.. defiantly recommend going here for some yummy Greek food and the portions are to die for. So filling I had a food coma after!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Nothing fancy but the best Greek Diner food in the GTA. Great portions. Reasonable prices. Bustling atmosphere."}
{"text":"Warning: they only accept cash. If you have USD, they'll take it but they'll treat it as equal to CAD. So you're 20US$ bill that is actually 25CA$ becomes 20CA$.

The breakfast was nothing to be missed:
- The toast was overbuttered before I could even try to scrape it off and pancake didn't have any butter. I would've wanted butter on the side of both.
- The western omelette was very heavy in ham. It was more like a scramble than an omelette -- the ham and whatnot were cooked into the egg instead of tucked inside. Doesn't matter to me, but I could've easily made this from home for cheaper than 10$.
- The stuff that came with the omelette (potatoes and lettuce/tomato) weren't that special either.

So I'm guessing this place must have great ratings for the non-breakfast foods."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!  Best souvlaki in town. It's all fresh. Yummy. Cheap. Generous portions. Quick. I love it!!!! 

Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Overall 
Too expensive! I ordered the chicken breast dinner (basically the same as the souvlaki dinner but it just comes with a chicken breast) and a small drink and it came to just over $18. Oh and tzatziki sauce costs extra. So does feta cheese.
Food 
Portions are huge. Couldn't finish. The chicken was cooked well and flavourful. The Tzatziki sauce was good as well. The Greek potatoes lacked flavour, and the rice & salad were just okay. 
Service
The lady at the cash was pretty rude, and so was one of the cooks. 
Wouldn't go back again! Honestly I've had better food+service at the Greek fast food places."}
{"text":"Best greek food... The portions are huge! Souvlaki dinner plate is my favourite and can easily be split between two people. Also the Zet burger is amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been at Zet's a few time and have enjoyed their souvlaki immensely. 

Unfortunately in this particular visit, I ordered the Pork souvlaki and the Pork was dry. Portions are still huge if you are looking for a positive. 

Hoping for better things next visit and remember, don't forget to bring cash."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY. Don't bother driving all the way over here if you are on business and plan to use company card.  They only want cash and have an ATM to make money off you.  It's 2017 and hard to believe in metro Toronto this is an issue."}
{"text":"Are you kidding, I'm sorry but what kind of taste do people have in this forum. Four stars? There's something really wrong here.  This place is a garbage hole. What a bunch of tasteless, overly greasy, overly fat saturated food. Poorly cooked and it wasn't even busy. Just came back from this place,  my wife and I were really hungry spent $26 for two burgers, fries and drinks. I could have grabbed the fries and wrung the grease out. Here's a hint for the cooks, your frying oil needs to be hot so that fries aren't greasy tasting and crisp. Additionally your food needs flavour. Learn how to spice up your food to bring out the flavour. We were so disgusted that we left most of the meal there. It's seems most of what people like about this place are the quantities. Not good enough , give me some real food with FLAVOUR and less GREASE!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The people are nice. The food is the best and the price is just right. The food portions are great and huge. You get so much for so little. Would definetly recommend this place and will definetly be going back again."}
{"text":"I've been going to Zets for about 6 years and I'm never disappointed. They take cash only and the service is fast. Since Im a regular, they normally shout out \"chicken or steak today?\"  I order souvlaki dinner or customize it to a steak dinner. I love how big they fill up the plate of ceasar salad, garlic potatoes & rice.  The best part is their tzatziki sauce, its thick and you get strong garlic breath but I love it!  Sometimes when Im in a rush I grab their poutine which is greasy cheesy goodness or their wrap or their burgers. Anything you have will fill you up and will taste great. On Friday & Saturday nights around 1-3am its normally packed by drunk, rowdy people but the owners really know how to get the food out fast and get the people out faster :)"}
{"text":"Don't go to Zet's unless you are starving or you have a truck to take home your left-overs.  A fantastic burger, with a perfectly cooked and tender patty full of flavour.  I get all the fixin's along with some of their famous tzatziki to complete the feast.  Add to that perfectly cooked fries and its a feast for the ages."}
{"text":"If you're going to go to a diner, this is a great choice. Great food, generous portions and fast."}
{"text":"Good late night spot if you are ever hungry...I get the burgers there and it's bomb...and it serves beer also and tons of parking"}
{"text":"Hell of a burger. Had the beef and chicken burger with sides of fries and onion rings. Had to take half home there was so much food. Fresh, fast and delicious. Loved all the toppings we could choose from too."}
{"text":"Fast and good lunch!  Can't go wrong coming to Zet's anytime of the day.  

The tzatziki sauce always has me coming back!"}
{"text":"Like another reviewer mentioned, this place is simply rated too high on this site and shouldn't been anywhere near the top for the entire city.

I suspect some restaurants such as this are loved simply because of massive portions. They'll get credit there, but QUALITY should drive the rating. Nothing stands out, and the pork souvlaki was overcooked, oily and frankly too much. A true Geek would shriek (hey, nice rhyme) at witnessing the overdone portions and multiple carbs/grains on the plate at once. Nothing else from the plate was memorable, and everyone at the table felt the same.

Doesn't get any points for ambiance either, and many fast food places are in better shape.

You will leave full...satisfied however? I don't see how."}
{"text":"Beware - only accepts cash! Aside from this minor snaphoo, the food here is pretty decent and the staff is friendly. Had a gyro sandwich and small poutine. The gyro was ok. A bit dry and the taziki was a bit thick. (I dunno, is that a bad thing?) Not a heck of a lot of flavor though. The poutine was good. I'm no poutine expert, but it was well done and the small portion was plenty for two."}
{"text":"Great food with even greater portions! This place is 24hours so that's a bonus. Try the chicken souvlaki dinner. I guarantee you will not leave hungry. Their menu has something for everybody plus they have all day breakfast. Just remember to bring cash since they don't accept debit or credit."}
{"text":"\"I dont care how long your flight was, Im getting a souvlaki ...sleep in the car!\" Based on a true story"}
{"text":"Delicious & convenient! Large portions, great taste and always leave satisfied.  Open 24 hours, however be sure to have cash with you as it's the only method of payment! Well worth it and would recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is alright. It is overly expensive and they only take cash. Ordered fish & chips and a chicken pita. This came out to $34.00. We paid and got back Canadian currency. The beers selection is decent. Late night this seems like the hotspot for people staying at airport hotels."}
{"text":"One of the pleasures of travelling abroad to some cities especially within Asia is that it is common for businesses to close super late or are 24 hours. It's one of the things I wish there was more of in Toronto. And finally there is! 

Open 24 hours! steak, souvlaki, all day breakfast! crazy portions! I am in heaven!

The food is wonderfully prepared, chicken is perfectly cooked, healthy amount of toppings on the salad, and a good amount of tzatziki sauce. The whole plate bursting with food. It's a beautiful thing to behold. 

It's hard to think of ways to improve this place, because it's so good. Perhaps dessert options, but you aren't likely to have space for it. 

It looks like they renovated the place, and it looks awesome!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here early in the AM to find out that they were closed for cleaning until 5:30AM. It wasn't a problem considering I had a bunch of time to kill waiting for someone to arrive to Pearson. Got the chance to find out that someone was sleeping in the back of their car and then all sudden stumbled out of the car to only get back in...? Think this cycle went on 3 times. Luckily they finished early considering I came early specifically to eat at Zet's LOL. 

I ordered a gyro dinner but they did not have the fryers completely set up yet or any rice ready, so I was offered home fries instead. After reconsidering my choice I ended up counter-offering if they could replace the rice with eggs (it was breakfast time anyways) and they without hesitate accepted with no extra charge! 

The food itself was great the portions are generous and fairly priced. They recognize regulars and always have their orders ready when they are expected. As a 24/7 spot they still make sure they upkeep a high standard of customer service. 

But also adding on to the fact that it is a 24/7 restaurant you also get the chance to run into quite the characters especially in the late-late nights, obviously not their fault but don't come here expecting to not see something here and there. 

Great way to justify airport runs just make sure you don't fall into the itis on the 401 heading home cause that what I did and it made the drive back a littttte rough."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken souvlaki dinner, it was huge, way more than I could finish. The grilled chicken tasted great, didn't like the alot of cheese on my salad though. This place takes cash only, they do have an ATM machine in restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a food factory.  You order, they cook, you move down the line and you pick up your food, you find a place to sit, you eat, you leave.  This is a cafeteria style order, pay, pickup and self seat type of place.

While this place may seem like a constant machine of serving the public there is a bit of a charm that comes with a place that been around so long and has such a loyal customer base and the fact that this place doesn't have to be trendy, bend to any trend because they are masters of doing what they do.

With the ever increasing prices of food and general rise of costs in everything this place is your proverbial oasis and harbor in the storm.  The problem with being as popular as this place can be what you will experience is fighting for parking, fighting for a place to sit but when all that falls into place what you will have is a LOT of food for a really reasonable price.  

Meals here are enough to feed 2 normal hungry adults.  I'm a big guy and if I was really hungry MAYBE I could finish a souvlaki meal but I highly doubt it.  The servings here are borderline absurd.  This place is probably the Greek/Canadian equivalent of \"Claim Jumper\" in the US that being serving sizes are pretty much on the family size side.

My brother paid for both meals and we ended up sharing a bit of each plate.  To put it in eating terms we are self proclaimed \"heavy hitters\" when it comes to being able to eat a lot.  I mean we pride ourselves in being the type of customers that all you can eat places treat as \"the exception\" and we often try to gauge what we eat at those types of establishments to be able to say, yeah, we made a \"profit\".  
 
Besides the almost obscene amount of food you receive from Zet's the food itself is better than average.  The burgers are OK.  The fries taste good but I wish the batch we had received had less of the \"crunchy bit, small bits, tiny pieces\".  I prefer long fries as opposed to tiny pieces.  My brother had ordered the Zet's burger which is basically a double bacon cheese burger and it's pretty big.  For 9 dollars before tax that's not much at all considering how much beef is and how much it costs to even go to McDonald's.  The large fries that he ordered was 5 bucks.  It's a pretty large plate of fries for 5 bucks.  Basically for 13 plus tax his 2 plates barely fit on the tray he carried it on.  

I had ordered the gyro plate which I assumed was going to be a rice, salad, potatoes and gyro meat on a single plate.  I was wrong.  It was one PLATTER of rice, Greek salad  (maybe 6 or more olives, feta, onions, lettuce, tomatoes), what equates to a whole potato on one plate and then an entire OTHER plate for a gyro in a pita complete with tzatziki, tomatoes, etc.  It was a HUGE meal for 14 bucks plus tax.  The gyro was great tasting and their tzatziki went so well with it as I think it sort of needed the sauce as it was a lot of meat in that wrap that needed to be lubricated.

They have \"help yourself\" pitchers of water with red plastic glasses at the front counter as well as take out containers because you know, they expect you won't eat it all at the restaurant.  The water is nice because that's all I wanted, not necessarily bottled and I didn't want pop.

They only take cash but for your convenience they have 2 ATMs at the right side of the counter.  There is no place to bus your own platters and it seems they have a dedicated person to do that.  The fight for tables is a real one.  I had my red water I had put down at a table right by the pick up counter and by the time I had picked up some salt, pepper, and ketchup, extra napkins and returned some dude was putting his stuff down at the table.  I politely mentioned I had my drink there already and he said he thought it was from before and politely left the table.  

The bottom line is this place is hands down probably the best bang for the buck place I know of because the portion sizes for the cost could have you wondering how this place makes money... well they also serve steak but their souvlaki platters are dare I say, \"epic\".

Oh and for being able to eat here how does 24 hours sound?  Just think how busy a place like this would be after the bars close... 

You can see the Vista cargo terminal at Pearson from here as that's right across the street.

5* for value, 4* for everything else."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great portions and amazing food! If you ever want a steak or some souvlaki at 3am, this is the place to be. They also serve beer late into the night."}
{"text":"Visited May 19 for dinner. 
Old school diner type of place. 

Pros 
Poutine - Crispy and tasty, the small portion is already big enough. 
They are known for their chicken souvlaki dinner, came with 6 poeces of chicken. Way too much dressing on the salad. 

Soup of the day was barley which was surprisingly good. 

Cons 
Cash only.  
Line can get long at times.

Damage - $29 no tip needed

Protip -  Very difficult to get to by car, I was on 401 East and I had to exit and make a u-turn and go back on 401 West."}
{"text":"\"Don't Believe the hype,\" is the seminal single off Public Enemy's second album, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, it is also an extremely apt descriptor when discussing Zet's.  It should be noted that Urban Dictionary describes the aforementioned as ignoring the media, marketing, buzz, or rumors that surround a story, object or person -- and that said story, object or person is in a sense undeserved of much of the accolades that have been bestowed upon it/them.  I wish I could omit Zet's from this list of chronic underachievers, but I simply cannot.  I know that some may argue that it has stood the test of time if you will, and that due to this fact has demonstrated success in an oft fickle restaurant industry, and this I cannot refute.  Zet's does have many positives, 24h service an \"all-day breakfast\" and a fully licensed bar, so all is not lost.

Maybe, just maybe I'm being a little too hard on Zet's, as it was recommended to me by a man whose opinion on all things food related I have come to greatly admire and respect, and having him steer me awry was much like finding out that Santa Claus didn't exist, had never existed and was simply a figment of some Hallmark marketing exec's overactive imagination, leaving me with feelings of sorrow,angst and a jaded view of the world.  So maybe, just maybe it's not Zet's fault.  How could it possibly compare to the utopia discussed in hushed reverential tones by a man whose knowledge on such matters was never questioned.  

In looking at a few of the other reviews on Zet's I would offer this nugget of wisdom if you will, Janelle W. remarked that Zet's is \"as if someone picked up a 24 hour diner from Detroit and plopped it -- including cooks and customers -- right next to Toronto Pearson Airport.\" So I will use this to segue to a nice plug for the DETROIT Eatery in Toronto, if it's the charbroiled taste of Detroit that you crave look no further than Logan and Danforth-right in our back yard people!"}
{"text":"After a long night of a Jays vs. Phillies game and dancing our fancy, my friend decided we get Greek Food. In the years that I lived here, this was my first time I E-V-E-R discovered a 24/7 Greek Restaurant. Right there and then I was struck by AWEEEE.....my feet were tired and my tummy was rumbling, Greek Food at 3am it was!

The staff here are friendly, the menu is extensive, the food is fresh, the souvlaki is oh-so-tender and juicy! I The plates are HUGE (enough for two to share), and the tzatziki makes you just want to shout out OPA! 

Overall the food is good, it gets in an eclectic crowd from the employees right down to the police, office workers, and tourists. It goes above the typical diner feel of your average burger to a diner offering ethnic cuisine and great prices!

OPA!"}
{"text":"Holy Moly Portions! Can't lie I did almost finish it, what can I say it was delicious. Good Greek comfort food, my chicken was cooked perfectly, salad was delish and potatoes were yummy. Rice was just okay but my favourite was the tzazakki sauce, zazziki, tasikkiii! How do you spell that darn word!!! Anyways that tangy white sauce was actually one of the best I have ever had. They have all day breakfast here and the burgers also looked amazing. Overall it was a great dinner, and it's right beside the airport so pack a luggage and take yourself on a nice vacation! Take me too please."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night meal. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger, veggie burger and a small poutine. The portion you receive for the price is really good (all three items for under $20!). I couldn't even finish my burger! The only issue is that they take cash only. 

Will definitely be going back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"HUGE PORTIONS.

I felt that needed to go first. Honestly their portions are good for two. Its open 24hrs so its great if  you can do the drive after some late night clubbing. 

Food is good and cheap."}
{"text":"I like to think of Yelp as an old friend when I am on the road and looking for a good place to eat.  Unfortunately even your best friends can let you down sometimes.  That is how I feel walking out of Zets.

I was staying near the airport and looking for a quick place to grab lunch.  Seeing a solid 4 stars and over 100 reviews for a place only 5 minutes away put me on a mission.  Thanks to previous reviewers - I knew I had to pick up some cash, which I did.

I got there and the line was longer than it needed to be and a tad unorganized.  The decor looked like a bingo hall and the menu was barely recognizable - with the menu for the all day breakfast so far away that it might as well not have been there at all.

The counter person was unable or unwilling to answer questions and did not even look at his customers as they ordered.

However - all of that is acceptable if the food is solid.  Unfortunately, we had no such luck.  In a Greek diner I am gonna order the gyro 9 outta 10 times.  Only after I ordered did I realize there was not a meat cone in sight - uh oh!  As my tray slid down the order line - I looked in horror as uniformly sliced pieces of meat sat grilling on a flat top like your average Philly steak meat.   The meat slices looked consistent enough to make me think that they may order the gyro meat pre-frozen, but that thought is so painful that I can't even confront it.

I got to my table with my gyro and found mealy tomato chunks and wilted lettuce to go with my overdone meat.  The pita was fresh and nicely warmed, but the z sauce was just average.

To top it off - the tables on either side of us were not cleared the entire time we sat there.

The area around the airport is a food desert so I suppose you may find yourself giving Zets a shot - you may even find me in there again, but it won't be because I am going out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"This isn't the best area or the most pleasant restaurant from the outside, but the prices are so reasonable for huge portions of food. Nice big restaurant with lots of seating and plenty free parking. Different options of food. I usually go here for bunch, haven't tried their souvlaki yet but I hear it's good. Cash only place and their is an ATM inside. Would go back if I'm in the area or just craving a big breakfast again."}
{"text":"Nice food but little bit expensive 
We went there on Saturday it was so busy it took us 30 mins to order but we enjoyed our dinner recommended"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the chicken Greek salad.
Chicken was a bit tough and the salad dressing was too overpowering with garlic for my taste.
Portion size was good as usual."}
{"text":"Everyone knows at least one other human being in the GTA that knows ZET'S! 

If you're deciding on trying it out just know this place is a sacred right-of-passage. No one has ever tried ZeT's and stayed quiet. The food is delicious and the portion per price ratio is quite astounding. 
Its not a fancy place by any means but it has a home air to it. You line up, you order, you take order to seat and thats it. But they serve each platter with such generosity. Try their souvlaki!
I've had their massive burgers (cause i can't stay away from burgers) and their souvlaki and their fish n chips... I will definitely be back.

The one day we decided to share the experience with family friends was the one and only time they had a brawl. (And by brawl I mean to ghetto-fabulous ladies that decided to pull out the claws) it was hilarious to watch the guy that they were fighting over try and separate them. The cops were called. It was straight out of Jerry Springer. We explained to our fam that we've never seen that before and they laughed at us...oh well- dinner and a show!"}
{"text":"I ordered the famous chicken souvlaki.. and by jeez! Just by the look of it, I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it. I ended up  taking the rest home. The service was fast. I didn't know that they didnt take debit (not until I read the reviews here)  but good thing that the atm is just inside the resto itself not just 1 but 2 atm's.

I have to agree that the presentation doesn't look great but the food is good. I like that it's open 24 hours, that I have the option not to eat just fries or just bagel or donut... I mean I don't  have to drive to mcd's or Timmis whenever I feel like having midnight  snack.

Overall the experience was good.. I will definitely go back to Zets!  :)"}
{"text":"Great spot to get some meat when you are by the airport. 
I had the Zet's burger on my most recent visit, it was huge, and very tasty. 
My girlfriend had the chicken souvlaki, it was so big, very nice tasting too."}
{"text":"DINER OPEN 24 HRS ........great ! 
I've been going here for years and this place never surprises me  ! 
Good food, great prices and the souvlaki dinner is huge (enough for two to share) with the home made tzatziki and greek salad..its one of my favourites.  I've had breakfast here at 3 am, lunch at noon and even had dinner here.....always fun to watch the variety of people eating here - very cool mix, YYZ employees, police, office workers, tourists and the list is endless."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner before catching a flight. Humongous portions!  Got the Zet Burger - $8.95 for a double pattie with bacon and cheese. How can you possibly beat that!? It came with a big fat bun but it was too much. I think it's too much for everyone from what I could see leftover on the dirty dishes."}
{"text":"the food is amazing and the prices are reasonable. Staff is super nice and they're always smiling."}
{"text":"Zet's is a very popular self serve diner style restaurant near the airport located in Mississauga. It's open 24 hours and they only take cash but they do have an ATM machine on site if you do need to withdraw some cash.

I went there for a late lunch somewhere around 2 pm during a weekday and the place was pretty busy. I decided to order their famous chicken souvlaki dinner ($15.95 plus tax) which came out from the grill pretty quick, less than 5 minutes. The dinner was huge, enough food to feed two people. It comprised of a greek salad, rice, potatoes,a chicken souvlaki skewer and a toasted buttered bun. The food was okay, nothing special. The chicken souvlaki was decently seasoned but the chicken wasn't tender or juicy. The greek salad was nice and fresh and the rice was fine but the potatoes had an odd taste to it. It's reasonably priced for the amount of food you are receiving but the quality of food is just average and the chicken souvlaki doesn't match anywhere near the quality provided on the Danforth.

If you are looking for a place that's open 24 hours in the west end and provides okay food with huge portions at a reasonable price, that comes out pretty quickly, then Zet's is something you might want to try."}
{"text":"After hearing about Zet's from many people, I decided to check it out! I was a little put off at first by the look of the place but once I got my food my mind changed! I got the chicken souvlaki...its huge and delicious! It could easily feed two people. I can't wait until my next visit!"}
{"text":"i had the chicken souvlaki on a pita and the fries...the food was ok, kinda expensive but, some dinners are 20-25 bucks a plate, really expensive, mind you the steaks look good but a tad pricey based on your overall dining experience ( a burger joint style appearance)... i spent twenty five bucks on a  few items,poutine, drinks, chiken on a pita and a side of fries..
its ok if your coming off a red eye, but i woudlnt seek out the place..."}
{"text":"If you haven't heard about Zets then you must be living under a rock LOL.  Just kidding.  For those of you that have not heard about it well here it is.  This is a legend located right by the airport.  This is a 24 hour place that's right 24/7.  All day breakfast and all day dinner.  That's right you can have bacon and eggs and a Zet Burger at the same time.  

Zets serves everything from simple breakfast right down to steak dinners.  Tons more options in between of course.  I have been to Zets more times than I can count at all hours of the day and night.  I have never been let down.  My personal favorites  are the souvlaki and the burgers.  Keep in mind ive tried almost everything on the menu LOL.  I must warn you about the portions here.  They are INSANEEEEE.  There is nothing small at Zets LOL.

Zets deserves 5 stars all the way.  Keep up the great work guys and see you soon.  Day or Night hmmm not to sure LOL"}
{"text":"all i have to say is \"love it\" always a good meal.  Fast and not too hard on pocket but they only take cash"}
{"text":"My go-to for Greek food. Its fast, large portions, and open whenever I have a late night craving for it. Sadly I wish they accepted credit card but overall I do love zets! Their chicken souvlaki dinner..... Mmmm love it!"}
{"text":"So confused why this place has good reviews, has no flavour, you can only pay cash and the meals are expensive. I would only recommend only if you close by and nothing else is open."}
{"text":"Pretty busy spot we've got here. Good food, and big portions.

The Zet burger was massive and very good. A bit messy but good. Poutine was a bit soggy. 

One thing keeping this from a 5 star is one of the pattys in the hot hamburger dinner wasn't cooked all the way through, a bit red on the inside. 

On the other hand, The steak was cooked to perfection and was very good."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!  Seriously!! 

After spending a day on the west side (mississauga) I was taken to this place as a surprise and it was indeed a pleasant experience.  Lots of people eating, very busy, long lines (which moved quickly) and the food and salads looked FRESH. 

I ordered the chicken souvlaki and it came with rice, potatoes and salad (huge portion!) and I got a bite of the burger too (double decker) soooo good.   Prices are AMAZING! 

The fries are great too. Oh and the tzaziki is out of this world, thick, tangy.. Seriously! Go there, you won't regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing burger. Was so big that I had to squish it slightly to take a bite out of it. 3 layers of beef which h tasted soo fresh. The bacon added the right amount of crispyness and flavour to it. We could also see planes take of and land from this location. Definitely will go back for more."}
{"text":"THE BEST!!!!

The portions are huge and the prices are very good. Every single item is excellent and home made. 

The best is Souvlaki Dinner. So much food for the price. 

Hamburger is 10/10 as a close second"}
{"text":"Damn that chicken was juicy! The portions are big and definitely quick despite walking in and seeing a long line. Ou can tell there are many locals that come by here often. Prices are fair for the portions you get and speed of the service. I walked in here with my family not planning on having anything cause I wasn't hungry. I couldn't have been more wrong about by appetite!"}
{"text":"Came late night around 2:00-3:00AM and it was decently busy. I came on the recommendation of a couple of friends who are regulars. 

I ordered a chicken souvlaki dinner and the serving was huge, an upside for me. It was your typical Greek souvlaki dinner and everything was seasoned well. 

I would probably come back if I'm hungry and it was past midnight and everything else was closed. They only take cash and the ATM charges you an additional $2 on use. Come prepared with cash."}
{"text":"Craving pork souvlaki after coming home from Greece.  First time here.  Huge portions.  Pork souvlaki plate was huge - big enough for 2.  Garlic sauce was thick and tasty.
Also ordered the steak and eggs plate at lunch.  Steak was grilled to order.  OK quality and cooked medium rare as ordered.  Came with lots of home fries.

Overall, super quick service.  Long lineup but line moved fast.  2 plates was enough to feed 3 people.
Great place to eat near the airport.
Burger and onion rings on other tables gook great.  

Like the other reviews, pork was a bit dry but overall - good value for price paid.  Now i know why this place is always busy."}
{"text":"After finishing my shift at the airport, it was well after 2AM in the morning so my colleague and I decided to give zets a go.

Big mistake, I couldn't walk out to my car after being filled with so much food!! And for the price, get out of town. It was insane! Everything tasted pretty good and all I wanted to do was eat more! I definitely would come here if I ever was in the area again because everything is just amazingly well done."}
{"text":"Just love this restaurant. Chicken souvlaki is my go to. Food is delicious consistently, which is key for every restaurant. Huge portions that satisfy your very soul (Generalized confession of a glutton)."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on a random Tuesday morning. The girl taking our order was not very friendly, and also did not let us know that to get a pop instead of a coffee or tea with our combo would be full price. She also gave me a LARGE pop without asking us what size I wanted. The large pop, which should've been a small size, was $2.25. OH, and best part, no refills on pop. 

The amazing eggs I was given is the only things saving my review from a 1 star. Eggs & toast were perfect, the hash browns weren't my favourite."}
{"text":"I have made several trips here and I must say none of them have been disappointing. The food always is in large portions but so good! The service is fantastic and quick. My only complain is that only take cash, I here business that only take cash!! 

This is the Greek version of fast food, the menu is quite extensive and everything can be made into a combo. I order the burger and it was huge! I have also tried the lamb souvlaki over rice and it's not only huge but it come is a mountain of rice, potatoes, salad and sauces. The chicken and beef platters are similar in portion on and sides. I think the lightest or smallest thing on the menu is the wrap. I cannot say enough good things about the food as in my opinion it is cooked to perfection! 

Inspire of how much I love the food here I equally hate the fact that they only take cash! There POS system in the most archaic, Stone Age, piece of shit technology I have ever seen. The 18th century had better. I hate so much having to go to the bank before I come here! Going the 21st Century Zets get a fucking debit/credit machine!"}
{"text":"1) 24 hours
2) Cash only
3) Portions are [b] gigantic [/b]

I'd find it hard to believe if someone told me Zet's wasnt the best food available within a couple km radius of the Pearson airport. 

What makes Zet's stand out is the fact that they combine portion size and quality. You'll be hard-pressed to match this combination elsewhere. Speaking solely on having their souvlaki dinners (both chicken and pork), I can confidently say that upwards of 90% of people will not be able to finish this dish. It comes with greek salad, tzatziki,, rice, and potatoes, and that's just what's on the main plate! There's also a side plate that has some buttered toast. The problem here is that, while all these sides are delicious, you also have a portion of meat the size of an 80s cell phone! 

It's truly insane. This plate will run you approximately $15. Truly, you can purchase this with the intention of consuming it as 2 separate meals. In that case, at $7.50 a meal, you're getting a great deal! But trust me, it's difficult to save the good stuff for later. This is some seriously good stuff."}
{"text":"We were looking for late-night food after seeing a concert in the Toronto area, and we're really happy to have stumbled on to Zet's! My husband had steak and eggs breakfast, and I had a cheeseburger and fries. We both thought the food was very tasty, and it's made fresh by line cooks who put the condiments and veggies on right there for you. The staff were friendly and efficient, and the food was very good. The environment isn't especially conducive to a leisurely meal, but they were definitely hopping at midnight on Tuesday night. We'll go back next time we're in the area. Cash only, but they have an ATM on premises if you need it."}
{"text":"Cash only  .. portions were huge .. had steak and shrimp and a bowl of chilli .. steak was done to perfection no sauce required .. shrimp was ok .. potatoes  and rice were excellent greek salad was to salty from dressing .. chilli was ok .. this place is on 24 hours"}
{"text":"Whenever the bae and I are headed to Brampton late Friday night to his parents (which is often nowadays) we head to Zet's as its on the way and open late.

As many others mentioned - huge portions!!!

I usually opt for the fish and chips, which are a delicious pile of fried yum. Only wish they had fresh lemon and homemade tartar. Oh well!

Bae's fave is the chicken souvlaki dinner, very tasty!

Pro tip : their potatoes (which you will probably have leftovers of) make awesome home fries for breakfast the next day!"}
{"text":"I want to give this restaurant 3.5 stars.  I came in on a later flight last Sunday, which means = trip to Zet's before heading home (right??).  

I had a burger, fries and a diet soda.  The burgers are good; typical greasy spoon burger.  No exciting condiments, though they do make their own BBQ sauce in house, which is better than nothing (I hate ketchup and mustard on my burger, fyi).  I prefer white onions to red, but they only have red.  The bun is excellent and the fries are really good.   The best part of a Zet's trip is the tzatziki.  It's the best I have ever had.  EVER.  It is creamy, refreshing and has a garlic-y bite.  I dip my fries in it.  

It's a bit dingy inside, it's cash only (annoying).  The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap and tasty. 

Only downfall is no debit or credit. Only cash. Be prepared to use the ATM."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.
I thought this place was pricey when I came here ($13-16 for a plate) until I saw the mammoth portion sizes that Zets serves up.
The place was busy. I stopped here with my family and our neighbour who was dropping us off at the airport.
I had the chicken souvlaki and salad. It was delicious.  My dad had fish and chips, my mom and sister had pork and potatoes. 
Everything tasted great. I love sauces and I loved the tzatziki sauce on the boiled potatoes. 
The meat was good, not tough, and the salad was tasty.
I would recommend splitting a platter for two.
We were stuffed and had so much left over.
It worked out though because my flight was delayed seven hours and I  had it for leftovers. 
Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Do not go if not hungry. All portions are on the big to quite generous side. Perpetual line of people. Not enough parking when really busy. Once order is placed, not too long and your food is ready."}
{"text":"SO MUCH FOOD! Food coma alert! 

Quick service, HUGE portions, spacious dinning area and parking lot = worth a try!

We got there early enough (before noon) so the lineup wasn't too long. By the time we were leaving (just before 1pm) the line was just so long. But quick service and turnover rates. Both my boyfriend and I could not finish our food. I got a wrap and he got souvlaki on the bun, not even a full plate. Can you imagine how much of food you would get if you were to order plates?? Ingredients are very fresh since they are constantly making food. 

Overall, stop by this place if it is on the way for a quick bite (and it is 24hr) or want to stuff yourself. Be prepared to pack your leftovers to go!"}
{"text":"Huge portions for a great price.
Very fast service.
Definitely recommended around airport area"}
{"text":"Huge portions and delicious food every time I come here.  Love that they're always open, even at 2am after a night of heavy drinking with my friends out in search of munchies."}
{"text":"Always open... always busy. They are amazing almost everything on their menu is a must have. For the best thing in their menu in my opinion is the chicken souvlaki dinner. Pro tip they don't take debit or credit they have an atm machine so they pro tip is carry cash."}
{"text":"Really busy place during lunch hours but portion sizes are huge!  The burger is definitely a must try, not the biggest fan of the big fatty souvlaki they serve"}
{"text":"Had steak and eggs at 1am. Really nice tender steak. I was pleasantly surprised. Cafeteria style so ambiance is pretty basic but food was good. Fast service too."}
{"text":"Zet's is always dependable in quality and in quantity. Portions are HUGE and affordable. Zet's is a place where we often take out of town visitors and everyone leaves full and happy. In the 10 years of coming here I've yet to be unsatisfied. The souvlaki dinner is a must! My husband and I usually get 1 souvlaki dinner with an extra souvlaki skewer and that's more then enough for the both of us. Once you have the souvlaki dinner at Zet's all other places kind of disappoint, you'll forever compare it to Zet's.
Everything here is pretty good really. Other recommendations would be fish and chips and the banquet burger."}
{"text":"Perfection! Everything on the menu is good. The portions are abundantly generous. And watching them prepare the food even in the busiest of times is akin to the inner workings of a fine Swiss watch. Masterful.

Obviously, the Zet burger is one of the more popular items. It's a double burger with cheese and bacon... and it's big! My favorite is the peameal on a kaiser, which is almost like 3 or 4 small pork chops rather than the sad thin slices you might find elsewhere.

I also love the gyros on a pita. The tzatziki is incredible which is not only a staple on the gyro but also the oversized souvlaki on a bun - either in chicken or pork.

I've also had the pork chops, fish and chips, and the veal parmesan - surprisingly good Italian considering the place is Greek-dominant. Sides for the dinners are \"rice and roast (potatoes)\" which are seasoned perfectly. Finally, the salads are also amazing either as a side or a meal."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice, but still DREAM about the amazing food from time to time.

*Cash only* (usually a problem for me because I never carry any!)

Location: Very out of the way for me, since I live in the east end, but it has become my go-to spot for a pre-flight meal.

Price: Very reasonable for the portions you get!

Food: Amazing! So flavourful! Portions are HUGE. As mentioned, I always come before a flight. I never finish my food, and don't usually bring my leftovers with me... which is unfortunate. 

Service: You line up to order and then take your food to the table (so no table service), but when you're done you leave it at the table and they will clean it up. I like how casual it is.



Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Souvlaki dinner ever highly recommended. 24/7 they even have beer. The best breakfast before airport flights"}
{"text":"Great diner near the Airport , lots of selection and portions are Gigantic !! Like honestly too much food 
I never thought I'd say that But it's way too much !
If your hungry then come here if your not then come back when you are ! 
Burgers are great as well as steaks and souvlaki 
Great breakfast as well ."}
{"text":"Favorite spot for late night munchies down in Canada.

Zet's is a must; no questions asked."}
{"text":"What an incredible experience! You line up, order at cash, pay in cash, and then move down the line until your order is served and you take your tray to an available table. The diner is opened 24 hours! The cleaning staff is working round the diner cleaning every table. The constant lineup of people is a fascinating treat to watch!

And the food! My oh my! It's a large plate, a heaping serving of rice, 3 large potatoes, greek salad and the largest chicken souvlaki my eyes have ever seen! No matter how hungry I was and as much as I wanted to clean my plate, it was impossible! The salad, chicken and potatoes were delicious! The rice was lackluster. But then again, no one can cook rice like I do, so the standard for restaurant rice is set very high!

Next to the cash register are piles and piles of styrofoam takeout containers. Good plan bloke! I am having Zet's leftover for lunch at work!

I was delighted to have a late dinner at this diner. The menu, tables, setting all harks back to a cool time and it was a delightful experience!"}
{"text":"A normal man cannot finish this Souvlaki on a bun...

Zets is a place that doesn't understand portion control. My Big Fat Greek Restaurant would be the perfect description of Zet's. It's a trucker diner kind of place that is serving up breakfast, comfort foods, and Greek as well. You'll find a variety of burgers, sandwiches, breakfast food, and hell, even steak. The place is perfect for any picky friends you might have in your party.

Despite the vast menu they have, the four stars is really for their pork souvlaki on a bun. I've had their steak sandwich, which was alright, but the pork souvlaki is the real winner here. Souvlaki is meant to be a skewer of pork meant to be eaten for ONE person. But Zet's laughs at that notion by serving you a pork souvlaki on a bun that will make your lady parts quiver fellas.

The pork souvlaki is enormous and is grilled to a nice char on the outside. The meat to bun ratio is actually crazy as the bun cannot hold the meat. It's weak attempt at holding the beast only serves to embarrass it further. The blend of tzatziki, tomatoes, and lettuce enhances it further and makes for a damn good albeit, filling lunch. 

This spot is crazy busy during the lunch rush, so get here early or don't come at all. They even have a security guard monitor the parking situation because it's serious stuff over here people!

P.S. Cash only but they do have an ATM in house."}
{"text":"Not built on fancy interiors, just good solid quality of food, price and friendly service."}
{"text":"Zet's is your typical greek burger joint. The food is good, the portions are gigantic, and the prices are fair. The fries are particularly enjoyable. It's definitely a nice change of pace from all the chain restaurants that litter the area around the airport."}
{"text":"Definitely doesn't need a formal review from me of all people but I can definitely tell you we were much happier coming back here than eating at The Mission next door. It's getting really pricey here however -- $14.99 for a zets ceaser salad and chicken on top is a tough pill to swallow 

3.5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Huge portions, I mean HUGE! Definately recommend the pork souvlaki dinner.  It's the best hands down.  I find the portions are larger if you eat in as opposed to take out.  

Sometimes the guy that clears the table is a bit, I dunno..he has a little jeneussai quoi.  Didn't like to have the trolly with the empty plates and food with flies parked beside me while he cleared a table.

If you can forgive that, you gotta come here.  Steak and eggs plus toast and homefries for $16.95.  Cash only.  They don't have debit but they've got an atm at the place.  It's pricer than Jimmy the Greek but your paying for what you get.  

Burp...if I could I'd go again and again"}
{"text":"Somehow, we ended up here after one of those \"where the hell are we going\" moments...

Luckily we were hungry because the portions are HUGE!

You could easily share, that's for sure. You are getting your money worth here but I actually prefer smaller portions because I find more care is put into the food.

It's also open 24 hours which I am not fan of, I understand it is located at the airport and people are always coming and going but... Being open 24 hours doesn't give them the proper time to clean the place...

The food here is all over the place, from burgers to Greek, poutine and more... 

The quality of the food is lacking, the prices may be fair but you are really getting what you pay for, low quality slop."}
{"text":"Great late night go to spot.  Food comes in HUGE portions and well worth the money.

I usually get steak, which is always cooked to perfection.

Line up can get out of hand at times, but moves quick.  They only take cash and there is an ATM on site.

Would def reccomend"}
{"text":"I come to an annual show at the International Centre and must eat at least one meal (usually more) at Zets.  Always a long line but the place is a fine oiled machine, it moves fast.   Burgers, steaks, chops, souvlaki are all amazing.   I cannot recommend this place enough!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice and crispy grilled cheese with a bit of oil batter soaked into the bread. Best item. The poutine was crap. Seriously tho that grilled cheese...it's weird. Weird but leaves you wanting more."}

I usually order the chicken souvlaki - best choice ever!"}

{"text":"went here with the gf and ordered - souvlaki on a bun $8.99 , fish on a bun $7.99 and onion rings $5+. souvlaki was big but was dry and lacked flavor. all I could taste was the tatziki sauce - go to astoria or other greek places instead. the fish on a bun was good, but small for the price. the onion rings are the usual, would prefer the panko breaded ones. would have given 3 stars but removed one due to it being cash only. come on its 2013, cash only? perhaps they own the atm and take advantage by dinging you another $1.99 on atm fees. not coming back"}
{"text":"Just came back from Vancouver and it was difficult to find a good restaurant that was open late. Found Zets on yelp and damn, this restaurant is a go. 

Long wait but that's because the food is amazing. Being open 24 hours is awesome. Gotta try their famous chicken souvlaki, by far my favorite."}
{"text":"So got here at around 7pm - post rush. Ordered the pork Souvlaki dinner. 

There was an average line of approx 10 people before me - so not crazy by their usual standards. 

Food came very quickly. Pork was cold and tough. Salad was over dressed. 

One of the gentlemen behind the counter was having a conversation with one of the patrons and kept repeating the word Curva. A derogatory word in Romanian. 

Terrible experience but hopefully a one off. 

My rating went down from a 4 to a 2."}
{"text":"This place rocks for a late night feed ...  particularly at 2am when it's -25 outside.

People reviewing here complain about the price.  I don't understand this at all.  It's not expensive relative to downtown Toronto prices for takeaway food, which is nowhere near as good as this.

Sure, the chicken souvlaki I got was ~$16, but it was freaking huge!!!  And I would rate it pretty damn good souvlaki; not the best in Toronto,but the best feed I've ever had at 2am.

The portions are huge for all the dishes (noted from waiting in line and other orders were completed), which I really like ....  does feel like value for money.   You get some big chunks of chicken, a bucket of delicious garlicly bitey tzatziki (which I could nowhere near finish with all the bits going with it), some decent but not overflavoured potatoes, and a decent salad dressing with a generous amount of feta cheese on top.

This is now my favourite late night eat in Toronto!  If you're looking for a more wholesome late night eat in Toronto, do yourself a favour and try it!

Keep in mind though they seem to only take cash though (as other reviewers note)"}
{"text":"Good Old Greasy Spoon

Food is fantastic - large portions.  

Fresh and hot... love going to Zet's!"}
{"text":"Great self-serve place!  Lots of food, good quality, and inexpensive.  I used to come here just to pick up the homemade tzaziki to go...it's delicious.  Garlicky, creamy goodness!! Mmmm
The portions here are very large; I can maybe finish half of a souvlaki dinner.  But you can always get a takeaway box to take the rest to go.  (You will probably need one).
I personally find the chicken souvlaki to be juicier and tastier than the pork.   I think the salad is really good and fresh, although sometimes a tad on the over-dressed side.  The potatoes are soft and sweet tasting.  Although the rice is honestly nothing to write home about, it's still not bad.  Most people come here for the Greek food, but the burgers and fries are also great.
Don't get discouraged if you see a long lineup, this place is run very efficiently and the line moves quickly.  I have been here many times and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great for after flight and anytime of the day, as there's nothing nearby that serves decent food as this place. The souvlaki dinner is huge and you can share between 2 person.  This place only accepts cash and opens 24 hours. I tried the pork souvlaki which was tasty but I saw ppl ordering steaks and fish and chips as well. Definitely worth a try if you are by the airport."}
{"text":"When our car pulled into the private parking lot of Zet's at approximately 6pm, I was appalled by the long line up that I could see through the clear windows.  I was like, come on, was this a diner or a Tim Horton's?  Fast enough we realized most customers were there for take-outs (no trouble getting a table).  Let's say the ambiance at Zet's is not the greatest, though it is still better than Master Steaks.  Better light bulbs help!  LOL.

I am a good sport with below average ambiance as long as the food is good and the price is right (I love Master Steaks).  On these two fronts, Zet's delivers.  We ordered an order of pork souvlaki ($13) and an order of chicken souvlaki ($14), both came with rice, salad and roll.  The portion was *humongous*.  This was 2 meals-in-1 even for a man, no kidding.  Both the pork and chicken souvlakis were big chucks and tender, with the chicken more tender than pork.  They were also well marinated, tasty and nicely charred.  The tzatziki was a super star, because it was super garlicky.  The lettuce salad was fresh (no dressing).  The plain rice was average.  

This is a self-serve diner.  You have to grab the utensils and the take-out boxes for the left over yourselves.

I love an old-fashioned, family run diner that offers no nonsense homey food and a good value.  Overall, a solid 3.5 stars, but I bump it up to 4 stars because I am a sucker of nostalgia."}
{"text":"The portions here are well worth the price, this is the closest to authentic Greek food that I have had since I used to live on the Danforth. The food here is amazing and delicious always served piping hot and they give you just the right amount of  tzatziki to finish your entire meal however I am a tzatziki lover and always opt for the dollar extra but it's well worth it they don't stinge you on the amount 
Love love love"}
{"text":"Came here after a long day of hiking and I was ready for a big meal.  Zets did not disappoint!  I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner and got a huge plate of food for about $15.  I found the chicken skewer a bit dry, but it was okay with the tzatziki sauce.  They offered prompt service and I got my food within 3 minutes of ordering it.  It came with a generous portion of rice and salad, as well as a delicious buttered bread.  I was surprised that the bread tasted so good.  The dÃ©cor is mediocre, but nobody comes here if they were looking for a nice restaurant. Overall, the food was great and the restaurant was clean.  I would definitely recommend coming here to eat."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Zet's.
Everything on their menu they do well.  On previous excursions I've had steak, souvlaki, fish and chips and burgers.  All were at the very least good and filling, and mostly they were very good or better.
This time out had the cheeseburger and fries with gravy.  Had to be able to add Zet's to my burger list otherwise it probably could not be taken seriously.
Good sized burger cooked perfectly.  Old school as they come.  All the topping fresh and tasty.  Fries are probably the only thing they serve I think could use improvement, but dump some of their gravy on them and you're good to go.
Coming home from vacation and your flight arrives in the early am?  No problem, they pretty much never close."}
{"text":"- I have tried fully cooked steak here with fries and veggies while my bf ordered medium rare steak with scrambled egg. We both love love the steak, which was extremely flavourful and well seasoned. We stopped here for breakfast before my flight, and it was the best breakfast I have ever had lol (I never had breakfast with steak tbh). 
- Portion: generous, I was soo full afterwards
- Price: reasonable for a big piece of steak and lots of food on the side
- Place was very spacious, lots of tables and chairs 
- Will I come back? definitely yes if I have a chance"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out this place for over two years. I finally got a chance to try it out today. Located near the airport its definitely in a great spot to attract people.

The place itself is not fancy looking at all. Typical diner style you go up to the front order your meal and wait for it on the other side. The employees here work very well together and are very organized.

The pros of this place is the portions!!!! Omg huge portions!! I ordered 2 souvlaki meals and a cheese burger and 2 small fries and 2 extra tzatkiki. It all cost me $53 including tax!?! I mean, come on that cannot be beat! Please do not lower your portions as I really believe this is one of the best things you have going for yourself.

The food was okay in my opinion. The souvlaki is definitely a Canadian version of Greek style food. I'm use to eating at Astoria and this was definitely not authentic Greek style cuisine. The rice and potatoes were meh.. not seasoned. The salad was watery. The lettuce had a lot of water in it and it needed more dressing not to mention a lot of brown lettuce. I didn't like the shredded cabbage and carrot in it at all. 

Chicken was okay but not exactly seasoned like how the Greeks do it. The burger was okay too. Fries were delicious!!! Now I don't get how people think the tzatziki is the best they've ever had. 

The sauce should be so potent that you literally taste it in your mouth the next day. To me it was a mild version of the real thing.

Would I return?? Not sure. I'm thinking I could try something different. It's not like this review is going to hurt this place as the line up was almost out the door. Keep doing what your doing as people love this place!!"}
{"text":"By far the best Tzatziki and Souvlaki I've ever had... Enough said"}
{"text":"Great service. Had the pork souvlaki in a bun with tzatziki sauce. Loved the tzatziki but the pork while nicely charred and tasty some parts were slightly underdone. But an issue was that the pork for the dinner and bun were the same siZe. Making it bloody difficult and useless to have in a bun. The raw onions and tomatoes not exactly the ideal combination on it I feel though. 

The banquet burger was quite nice no issues there, but the fries were dreadful. Not crispy at the least and didn't have a fresh feel to them. 

Gonna try the chicken dinner souvlaki next time."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best 24/7 restaurants in the GTA, I mean where else can you get Chicken Souvlaki at 3AM?! Asides from that the service is always very good and even though they may be busy at times the staff is always courteous and polite. 

Menus offerings are pretty diverse, they have items such as: burgers, steaks, chicken fingers, and of course souvlaki. Now while the food may not be as good as \"speciality\" restaurants for said food offerings, it is still quite decent food. 

Having said that, prices are pretty reasonable, I had a Chicken Souvlaki and Beer for $20 and some odd cents. Which isn't bad at all compared to other restaurants I've been to. And not to mention the fact that the place is always open adds to the \"cost benefit\". 

There is always plenty of seating if you so choose to dine in, the tables are always cleaned and cleared by cleaning staff that is constantly revolving around the restaurant. 

Definitely a place I'd recommend checking out if you find yourself by the airport in the late hours of the night."}
{"text":"An amazing place to explore food.... Loved this place than any other greek restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here after a party that was in this area, hungry as hell. I was told this place was good so i gave it a try. It was about 2 in the morning with a good portion of people inside...so this place had to be really good. 

I ended up ordering the chicken souvlaki, fresh chicken, not expensive and it was such a huge portion that i only ate about a quarter of it and had to take the rest home. I was really really jealous of my friend that ordered the pulled pork sandwich....Amazing and huge. I am so getting that next time i come here. Possibly the best pulled pork sandwich i have eaten thus far. I really liked their Tzaziki sauce (hopefully i spelt that right). 

next time your in this area, come here and you will not be disappointed. Be sure to order The chicken souvlaki dinner or the pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Tasty food but as for the respect of first time customer...HORRIBLE! Careful how you pay if using US currency . 

Cash only so I only had US currency and asked if they accept US, the lady behind the counter said yes we do. First of all...informing the lady this was our first time here and saw it had great reviews ... what do you suggest?  She point at the first plate that was just made for the person in front of us. I asked what that was and she pointed up at the menu and said \" That \" . Ok... lol , thinking to myself couldn't of been a little more personable and explaining rather than saying nothing and pointing.  Moving on... after ordering my total came to $51.00 CAN ... I gave her $40 US and she asked for more...thinking in my head that's close so I gave her another $20 because that's all I had . She gave me back $14 CAN . In my head I knew it wasn't right and decided to look into it while eating . Caculated it out and they owed me approx $28 CAN back, another $14 CAN  ... kindly waited in the long line , I asked the girl \" I think you may have giving me the wrong change back \" she said no, you get $8 CAN back and $6 CAN which is based off 10% of what you gave me. I asked to speak to the manager and he explained,  due to the exchange rate from US to CAN we only give back 10%  regardless .....?? What!!?? Ok...so take the 10% they charge you but you still owe me . He explained if you gave 60 or 100 USA... no matter what the change is we give you 10% back. \" So you're saying if I gave you $100 US for a $51 CAN bill... you would only give me back $10 CAN and you keep the rest?? The guy says ... Yes, that's out policy ! Un fucking believable I said. That's illegal. .. he said no, it's my rule. Rather than breaking his nose, I figured not worth it and walked out. 

First and foremost. ... I get it, if that's the rules then the lady should have explained from the beginning because otherwise I would have easily gone to the ATM and pulled out cash and paid with CAN. 

Completely took advantage of the unknowingly US first time customer and totally illegal in my eyes. 

Fuck this place!!!! Never will I ever come back or refer this disrespect establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"Great Greek food when you need to eat fast.  Counter service is fast and efficient.  You will spend a bit more here, but the quality is top notch.  I had the Greek salad with grilled chicken.  It was not iceburg lettuce and had veggies.  Tzadiki was amazing."}
{"text":"We being self employed always look for places which are open late n serve fresh food. This place is great for its fresh food n quality ingredients . 
Just the ordering system could be better as you have to wait in line for a long time in the middle of the night . 
But we still go back as we love  the food . Keep up the great work !!!"}
{"text":"The cook was very rude. They don't wear gloves, which is unsanitary. Although the food was good, i still think they should treat their customers with respect and think of customers' safety, starting with wearing gloves."}
{"text":"Usually come here late at night and parking is always full and the place is jammed pack with people. The food is good and it's big portions so you definitely get your money's worth. The staff are nice and the wait isn't so bad even when it's really busy. Washrooms are decent."}
{"text":"This is a local favourite if you are in the mood for a greasy spoon joint. Their food is a twist on Greek food with an American flare. They also have all day breakfast of you are into that. 

I had the souvlaki on a bun combo and it was really good. My only issues were that the fries where greasy and the portion was huge. These really aren't issues but if you are not a large eater then consider splitting a meal. 

Check out Zet's and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and delicious pork and chicken souvlaki. The portion sizes make it hard to finish, so expect a doggy bag for home. We went during lunch hours, so expect a bit of a wait, but the line moves quickly. Service is quick and seating is plenty. No wonder they are open for 24hours, it's a local favorite. I'll definitely come back, if I am in the neighbourhood. The fish and chips looks also pretty good. FYI, bring cash, they don't accept credit. An ATM machine is also available on site."}
{"text":"I first discovered Zet's in the early 80's.  It's always been an airport workers hangout and they've always served some of the greasiest burgers and fries ever.  I outgrew Zet's and the next day pain from grease overload.  Zet's defines the term greasy spoon...if that's what you're looking for then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Great place and it's busy because it's great. Awesome breakfast and awesome souvlaki. Wish they had debit. The burger is decent at best and I wouldn't go for that. Anything Greek here is great. Salads are good too. Huge portions."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Great classic breakfast food and Greek favorites. Cafeteria style service with great fresh food. Fast service for not ready made plates. In town for 4 days, stopped in 3 times. It was great."}
{"text":"I had heard things about this place from other Yelpers, and when we ended up with a late night in Toronto with no great options for dinner, we decided to check this place out.

It's a great place for people watching. We saw all sorts of people: a group of cosplayers that seemed to be attending a nearby con, confused Americans, Canadian rednecks, all sorts of types. 

The food ordering process is pretty easy: Order and pay at the register, plates go up on the top of the glass, food appears as you're whisked down the line, and you are ejected at the other end with napkins, condiments, and then it's time to find a spot to sit, which wasn't too difficult.

We were a little too ambitious, and despite warnings about the portion sizes, ordered the pork souvlaki dinner (to split) AND an order of poutine (also to split.) The poutine made it so that there was way too much food. It was also not as awesome as the souvlaki itself. 

Mmmm, souvlaki. I never really ate Greek food until I moved to the East coast, and I really love it! This consists of ginormous chunks of pork, with rice and salad and some really delicious tzatziki sauce. 

So if you're near the airport and need a gigantic plate of food, this is the place to go. Yum!

One star removed because cash only."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Note this is a cash only restaurant. Only down side is my food was ready long before my husband's but not a big deal for us. His Zet burger was massive and delicious. I had the chicken souvlaki dinner which was WAY too much food. The Greek salad was great and I could have done with just the salad and chicken. Didn't need the rice and potatoes. We have been twice now and will be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!  I  can never finish my plate . The food is good quality. As a student this is my late night go to when I'm hungry and need a study break!

Also an awesome place when coming from the airport."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto last weekend for a wedding in Mississauga and I visited Zet's TWICE because their burgers were absolutely delicious!

The storefront is a diner, serving greek-inspired food as well as fried goodness and burgers.  

The burger was cooked to order, layered with cheese and bacon.  The meat was fresh and juicy!  

Wanted to send out Toronto love for yelpers who visit in the area.  Its a must-go, especially late night!"}
{"text":"Another baffling mystery to me as to how I have not reviewed this place yet?!? Honestly I am seriously slacking because I've been going to this place for years now and I swear I haven't been holding out purposely to keep this little gem to myself.

Let me first say that this place is truly the essence of what a road side diner is and all it encompasses so do not expect a trendy, pristine or refined place. Its spacious, offering plenty of seating in a sort of cafeteria/diner style with I will admit little to no interior design concept however they have recently updated their signage and a touch of interior redesigning going on so one must give them some credit on the effort.  

Open 24hrs for as long as I can remember this place has always been my go to place for Souvlaki; Huge portions with fresh, juicy chicken chunks and salad which is rare for an all night diner. I recently finally tried their burgers which are quite large and affordable too, standard condiment options but still a very tasty burger. I am not the biggest fan of their Caesar salad as I feel its a bit bland and on the watery side but I generally go for onion rings here anyway  They have all the usual artery clogging yumminess one would expect and they make a pretty mean breakfast too.
Food quality is always consistent and fresh which I didn't think would be the case upon first encountering the place years ago... But do not judge a book by its cover this place is a perfect example of that.

I find the service has always been good and very fast as well, especially considering the lineups cause this place can get busy late on the weekends. Regardless the service is always pleasant and I find them extremely appreciative of tips 

I am a night owl... Heck Yelp has even given me a badge for it but among all my late night spots this one always has my back when Im in need of a delicious and fast bite"}
{"text":"This is good food fast. Nothing special. Certain dishes are better then others. The Greek Chicken wrap is amazing. You MUST like garlic to visit the restaurant. Their Tzatziki is a giant WOW! The breakfast potato's are home made & the best part of their breakfast. Remember...they are cash only."}
{"text":"So I had a midnight craving and ventured out of downtown to Zet's. This place has been around as long as The Bay  and is open 24 hours. 

No frills restaurant that caters american and Greek food. You order, you pay, they prepare the food in front of you and you go get a table in the dining room. Fast service, cheap, convenient and HUGE portions. 

I had the Fish and Chip's (4/5). Fish tasted good, but it had a little too much batter and the tartar sauce was not house made but served into Kraft's brackets. Otherwise would have been perfect. 

They only take cash. Make sure you have some, Worst case they have ATM's on-site. Price is really reasonable for the portion you get. They have about 20 menu options and a all-day breakfast. Staff was pleasant. Even if they were busy and in a rush they were still joking with waiting customers."}
{"text":"This place is a not-so- hidden gem right in front of the Pearson Airport. 

The staff is so wonderful and the food is delicious. We got the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner and an extra small salad to share and two of us struggled to finish all that food. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone near the airport craving some tasty Greek food."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY 

This was my go-to spot because it was so close to the Sheraton Hotel that I stayed at. About an 8 minute walk! 

Zet's offers great food at great prices. I recommend their pulled pork sandwich and also, their pork souvlaki on a bun. 

My boyfriend and I shared the pork souvlaki bun the first time. The tzatziki sauce they have is flavorful. They used quality meat too. 

The second time, we thought the food was so good, so we decided to get our own platters. Of course...we couldn't finish it. SHARE IF YOU'RE NOT STARVING OR A BIG EATER! 

Only thing that sucked was that it was cash only which was inconvenient for us. 

So if you're staying at the Sheraton Hotel (or anywhere near the airport) stop by for some quality food at a great price. :)"}
{"text":"Ok....this place is about half a block from my office and I kept hearing everyone go on and on about this place and it's burgers.  So I walked down to try it about two weeks or so ago with my partner.  Cash only.  Thank goodness they had an ABM.  the total for 2 bacon cheeseburgers and fries with drinks was about $25+ for the exact same food I could get at Squareboy for half the price.  The food was nothing to write home about....actually it was quite bland.  If you want large portions of mediocre food then this is the place to go.  Typical greek burger joint/ diner.   Large seating area.  And it does fill a spot that is needed by the airport.....however it is just average.  Maybe I am disappointed by the hype up the place, but when you walk in to a lack-luster place that is so large that it is almost impossible to be greeted properly and then get served extremely forgettable food, then I guess even without the hype I would have been unimpressed.  I am sad to report that my would-be lunch spot by my office is no longer a valid option."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Zet's after hearing about it for a really long time. When we finally arrived, the outside signage looks renovated but the inside boasts plenty of seating and old signage. 

At 9PM on a Saturday, this place was very busy! There was a lineup through the middle of the restaurant. We ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner ($15) and small poutine ($6). 

The portion of the chicken souvalaki dinner was massive! It comes with greek salad, rice, tzatiki, potatoes and a buttered up bun. The food was delicious. 

I like that the restaurant is self-serve in terms of condiments and seating.

*Note* They accept cash only! They have ATMs in the store."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, tasty, awesome and big dishes food... Souvlaki on a bun is rich and delicious, hamburgers are full wholesome experiences on themselves."}
{"text":"This is a very late entry as I went to Zet's a couple of weeks ago with a friend. We had no business being at the airport other than wanting to sit around and watch the planes come in. Yes, I'm that much of a nerd and some of my friends put up with it! :D Anyway, we were feeling peckish when we decided to hit Zet's for lunch. We hadn't been here in a while so why not? I ordered the all day breakfast with polish sausage and eggs sunny side up. My friend got the pork chops with rice, potatoes, and a greek salad. I'd forgotten how generous the portions were for the price. So that alone makes it a good deal. Not to mention the food is tasty. However, my friend ended up taking a lot of it home and I don't blame her! That was A LOTA of food! So if you're ever around the airport, I'd pay Zet's a visit. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Bruh, You still aint check out Zets eh? You still reading my reviews eh? You still need to read reviews all up on yelp to ask yourself if you'll ever be man/woman enough to pull the trigger eh? Aiight, dont come here. I'll keep this place to myself and all the other peeps who know about Zets epicness. Real talk."}
{"text":"Amazing food. 
The souvlaki dinner is huge and the home made tzatziki is so good!"}
{"text":"3.5*, bumped due to HUGE PORTIONS!  

Going to/come from the airport and don't wanna go broke eating at Pearson?  Do you have a BIG appetite and enjoy gorging yourself silly?  Want to stage an impromptu eating contest at 2am?  Or would you like to feed several family members with 1 meal?  Then you've come to the right place, Zet's!

Located near the airport, this place is an institution for those who either work at YYZ or travel often.  It's also open 24/7 for people who keep odd hours.

Unless you're one of those big dudes who work on the tarmac, you will not, N-O-T be able to finish a dinner portion of their souvlaki meals.  Chunks of meat are big and they don't skimp on the sides or tzatziki either!

:(
Service is grumpy and not that fast.  To be expected for a diner, I suppose.  Took a good 10mins to get a Chicken Souvlaki Dinner, then again, I wasn't being rushy like other customers.

CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this would be a 3.5 star because of the portion sizes  and quality of the food, but this is not love - unfortunately - partly because I looked so forward to coming to this place for so long, ever since my brother mentioned it to me a long time ago. We have never been able to connect with him there so decided to go ourselves since we were close by at a convenient time. The disappointment for me was finding a cafeteria; I guess I really do appreciate waiter or waitress service!

Well it seems we got there at just the right time, as there were a few people ahead of us, but the lineup behind us just mushroomed! There were 7 or 8 people prepping the food, and nobody answers the phone (it rang about 10 times before I gave up.) but when we got there I barely had time to decide what I wanted when it was time to order. We took specials, but were a bit surprised at how expensive it came to (about $35.00). Getting through the line to where they were putting the meals together, we found out why: the somewhat grumpy woman at the cash got our order completely wrong! So the guy serving us unceremoniously dumped $12 back on our tray. I won't give these guys points for their customer service! 

And yes, by the way, they really are open 24 hours a day, 7 days per week! Crazy. And the clientele we saw were mostly men, and it seemed to be a bit of a league of nations. No problem with that - it just made it more interesting. It was, on the other hand, a bit nerve wracking to have a security guard at the door! They must occasionally have problems. But the customers didn't mind - they were ogling her!

However, the portions are very large, and the good was tasty, the meet quite tender. We had leftovers. 

On the other hand, I am in no hurry to go back! It's not my idea of fine dining. Besides, I prefer sit down service. For me, this visit felt too rushed. No wonder: we were in an out in 20-25 minutes!"}
{"text":"Late night disappointment: had the cheese burger and fries and was expecting home cut fries and a tasty burger worth the calories but instead got frozen fries and a bland pre cooked burger. I provably should have stayed with the Greek dishes in this popular restaurant."}
{"text":"Big portions  with no flavour!!! This is definitely a fast food joint. I used to go often years ago. I found that over time the flavour was bland. If you don't drench your food in some kinda sauce whether it's ketchup , zaziki, or whatever you're eating bland hospital food in monster portions !!"}
{"text":"Yups its true, the portions are HUGE.

I even skipped breakfast and came here for lunch and was not able to finish my meal.

I ended up getting the bacon cheeseburger, french fries and medium drink combo.  It was $8.35 plus HST.  They only take CASH here and there's an ATM in the corner by the restrooms if you need it.  The fee to use the ATM is $1.95

The person in front of me ordered the Veal Parmigiana sandwich and it looked really good.  Actually everyone's food looked quite tasty.  

I took a quick picture of my food but I really don't think my photos do it justice.

If I'm ever near the airport again, I would not mind stopping by again.  But this time I will probably need to skip breakfast and lunch, and come for dinner :)"}
{"text":"This place is the go to place for 24hr diner experience.
I've been going to this establishment for a good 10+ years and have seen the decors been updated and renovated.
Went on a Wednesday afternoon after attending the International Center and didn't order the regular I usually order (Pork Souvlaki Dinner), decided to try to the fish and chips and let me tell you. It is not what I expected as there was no crisp, it was very mushy and the fries I got which I regretfully upgraded to poutine. The poutine was absolutely crap, I should of known to not have order it as it was either not fresh as it tasted sweet. The cheese they use is like the package shredded kind which melted like liquid which made my stomach tell me to abort the mission. Should change the poutine to \"gravy with shredded cheese\".
I know they real busy and all, but they have to do diligence and replace their frying oil as the fries and fish did not fry properly. 
Be prepare to either bring your own thermal or purchase water as they got rid of the pitcher of water and cups. 
I'll come back, but won't be ordering the fish and chips and will stick to a dedicated fish and chips establishment."}
{"text":"The portion sizes are ENORMOUS and prices are reaaal decent for what you get! worth every penny. Lol The food was simply amazing, definitely much better than some other Greek fast food places I've been to and you could taste the difference :)"}
{"text":"Diner with large portions and a reasonable price. Food isn't something to rave about but on those days where you want that greasy diner burger, all day breakfast or fries...this is the place to be. Always busy at lunch and they serve food fast. Can't go wrong with $10 meal from here. :)"}
{"text":"Tried the fish and chips. It probably was not the best choice. The batter was not cooked completely. The cold slaw was fine, and the fries were ok. The staff were good, and the place was clean. Next time I would try the Greek dishes. They looked much better."}
{"text":"We always visit Zet's whenever we are in Toronto. Love the pork chops, T-bone steak and burger. The fries and Greek salad are great sides. And they only take cash."}
{"text":"Great little diner. Good food at any time, and open 24hrs
Usually get chicken sovlaki or steak which are both very good
Portion sizes are big!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken souvlaki dinner.   I could not completed it but it was very hot and fresh.   
It was fast from order to make!  They even cost in the meal no olives!   Good job!"}
{"text":"Parking was insane here which proved fan base of hungry hippos after a night of drinking. CHECK!

24/7 CASH ONLY! Card aficionadas head down to the McDs drive thru and miss the chance of having immense portions of grilled protein? Booooooo! Take that card and withdraw some of your hard earned cash from their ABM and end your night/morning with a perfectly balanced meal.
Steak and all day breakfast for the after work patrons to soothe aching labor pains. CHECK!
SOUVLAKI AND BURGERS AND FRIES AND EGGS!!! CHECK CHECK CHECK!!!!!

On one occasion though, we dined in and a maintenance worker was mopping with what smelled like a gallon of bleach a few tables over and stench was nauseating but he quickly rolled the bucket outta there as soon as he could sense me belching for air! YES BELCHING (MEANING: in the middle of chewing chunks of chicken and salad and gasping for air to continue my calorie MURDERING agenda!

Their wraps are AMAZING, pack it up with ONIONS and go to sleep, no brushing! Then you can wake up with the bestest (yes bestest grammar) morning breath to remind you of last night's bestest decisions made in life. 

ZET VAS GOOOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get it, this place come highly recommended and has rave reviews, but I ordered the \"famous\" pork souvlaki on a pita. I found the pieces too big to bite, the pork was oily and dry all at once, and it's not cheap. It was a large serving, I'll definitely give them marks for that, the tzatziki is nothing special, and the service is neither here nor there. 

The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but they have renovated since my last visit here. 

All in all service, meh, food meh, decor not bad, portions are huge. I think the place down the road may be better."}
{"text":"Busy 24hr dive... I say this as a compliment.  This place serves great Greek food.  Their portions are HUGE!  They serve chicken, pork souvlaki's, steak, burgers, seafood... Salad, Potatoes, Rice or fries.  Poutine is ok... 

Top sellers from what I have seen are their Burgers or Souvlaki dinners (with greek salad, potatoes and rice) or on a Pita.

A diners feel but again... Great food.

NOTE: Make sure you have cash when you come here.  
Parking is limited... so during busy hours it can suck as they are on a busy street that you cannot park on."}
{"text":"This Greek diner is too generous with their portion sizes. Not complaining though! Nothing exotic about their menu, which is great if you're looking for good quality, comfort food. Their souvlaki dinner is a decent dinner, and maybe even leftovers for lunch the next day! Their food tastes real - always fresh and not processed."}
{"text":"Prices more than showing on website now. Expensive but you get massive amounts of food. Fast paced and clean location. 25% chances they will pickup the phone for you to place takeout orders. Sturdy plastic containers used.  Cash only and open 24hrs !!!"}
{"text":"I've never been to this place until this year. My boyfriend brought me to this place and as sketchy and remote Zet's is... I LOVE IT! 

The only thing that I've ever eaten at this place is there chicken plate. It comes with chicken, a greek salad, rice, potatoes and most importantly... TZATZIKI sauce! I've gone to many Greek restaurants and I have to say hands down Zet's has THE BEST tzatziki sauce I've ever tried. It's creamy and garlicky. Their portions are also huge which makes up for the priciness of the meal. I think it is at least $10. However, they do provide free water and they are open 24 hours. For this kind of food and for the taste I definitely think that this place is amazing. 

I really have nothing bad to say other than it will make me fat. So definitely give it a try, check it out!

{"text":"Great place for quick food. They only take cash, which kinda sucks but they have an atm machine."}
{"text":"If you ever wonder what typical diners were like in 70's & 80's just come to Zet's. The signs maybe renovated but the inside remains the same.

With Zet's you will know what your going to get. If your health conscious this is not the place for you. The food is good, generous portions. I came here for breakfast and had the eggs, peameal bacon, and potatoes. The only reason I ate here was I had an airport run to do in the morning, not much else around the airport for breakfast.

Make sure you bring cash as they don't have interac, or you can pay two bucks  to use the ATM.

They are open 24 hours and serve alcohol also."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got two zets burgers and a poutine. Could not finish it at all because they give huge portions! Delicious food. Open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Zet's has been feeding the masses of Pearson Airport employees, 24 hours a day , for over 20 years. I'm no exception to this! This is the only place you can get a steak at 2am, cooked to order right in front of you! Whether or not you'd want one, I'm not sure however, I can safely say Zet's has made it possible for many flights to leave on time at 6am! Just a short hop across the street from the airport, Zet's offers up diner-style food in a warm and comfortable cafeteria style setting. They are famous for their souvlaki and steaks on a bun as well as their burgers. I myself am partial to the gyro which comes on a very tasty and soft pita with homemade THICK tzaziki sauce. If you're looking for a quick bite at any hour of the day, Zet's is the place to find it. Prices are reasonable, although not cheap by any standards. A souvlaki dinner (with rice, potatoes, and salad) will run you about $12-14. The burgers are around $6-8. Sandwiches (gyro, souvlaki, steak) will run you around $8-12. However, the All-Day-Breakfast is the best value at around $6-9 for a full serving of eggs, bacon/sausage, potatoes, and coffee. Alcohol is also available!

Tip: With the elimination of airline meals on pretty much every flight under 5 hours, why not grab a tasty breakfast before your 6am flight!

CASH ONLY!!"}
{"text":"Zets should get the GTA diversity award, this place has every person from every walk of life. Black, white, rich, poor etc...

   \"Oh cash only, bro,! I don't want to pay $3 ATM fee, I'll get you next time.\"

And that's how most discussions start at Zets with friends and relatives..... Yes, I paid for my brother, \"because, I am so nice.\"

The reason they do cash only is to get rid of the slow pokes who pay with plastic, because this place is too busy 24/7 that they can't have the production line slow down....

We were 10 deep at midnight on a Thursday. They took those orders in under 10 minutes...

They're as friendly as possible for a busy diner, but they can be condescending especially when they have people trying to figure out their toppings for the burgers... but when I'm the person behind them waiting, \"really??!? No soup for you!\"

The portions are big, we couldn't finish our rice and potatoes.

The souvlaki and the salad were mint... the western omelette wasn't anything special.

I'll be back alone... don't like paying for everyone else.."}
{"text":"I had the Zet's burger,  and it was humongous. It was really juicy and the bacon was perfectly crispy. Overall it was a great meal, and the service was fast and courteous.  

Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"We've just moved to Etobicoke and have had some trouble finding good affordable restaurants. I finally asked someone in an elevator where they go. Zets was the answer. So off we went. They have a very wide selection of choices. My husband is a hamburger and fries kind of guy and did not hesitate to order that. I had Pea-meal bacon and eggs. Needless to say my husband has found his new favourite place. I have had several different things since that first visit and haven't been disappointed. They make great soup! 
You order at the counter and wait for your food. No matter how long the line is, it moves very quickly. Be prepared , CASH ONLY! They do however, have a cash machine on site. It is hard to say which line is longer, food or cash."}
{"text":"I now work in the area of Zets, which I bet will be a huge problem for me.
Went a few weeks ago and got a side greek salad and a side of fries.
Yes, a very strange combination but it is what I craved.

The salad was amazing. Packed with flavour, lots of feta and super garlicky.
The fries were too greasy, but I ate them anyways. 
I will definitely be back for their souvlaki or burgers!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, usually after 9:30pm when other places are closed. Still a good option even if it were the only option. Huge menu selection including breakfast options. Portions are massive at very decent prices, reminds me of \"American\" potions. One plate can feed me and a friend with left overs. It is so much fun to see that much food in front of you! 

I like their signature burger and gyros dinner. The rice and potatoes served with the combos are AMAZING - my favourite! And I don't usually eat rice or potatoes at all. Juicy-ness level of their gyros is above average. And they always serve their dinners meals with a huge chunk of taziki! YUMMY! I also love that they're open 24/7. The only thing is their side salads could be more fresh.

Cash only and always busy.
Parking is always crowded too but never really had to wait long for a spot. There are always cars pulling out as there are going in."}
{"text":"The pork souvlaki was a bit dry for me but the side sauce (yogurt garlic sauce i think) was very good and made up for it. The pilaf looked plain but was good. The zet burger was definitely the highlight. I didn't expect much of it at first. The patty was thick, juicy, soft, just amazing and something I've never had before in a burger. The texture seemed like they grinded it themselves. The bun also seemed homemade and was soft yet toasty on the exterior. Very good. I almost went again for the burger the next day."}
{"text":"Took my wife to zets...She had a Pemeal on a bun..I had the Pork souvlaki dinner.... DING DING DING!!!!! WE HAVE A WINNER....wow delicious.. MASSIVE PORTIONS.... hockey game on the TV... doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Enormous portions! I went on an empty stomach twice and both times I couldn't finish my meal.

If you're not a big eater, I recommend going with something small or even splitting one order with a friend.

Items include burgers, souvlaki, steak, and breakfast.

Expect to pay around $12-$20 per person. It is cash only but they have an ATM.

No waiter service, plenty of seating, and open 24 hours.

Just a note: I've seen security present on weekend nights. Sometimes it gets loud/rowdy with people coming in from bars/clubs."}
{"text":"After eating at Zet's, getting Greek food at regular places like Jimmy the Greek or Opa doesn't compare anymore. I'm mad because I only discovered this place a few months ago with some friends who go regularly. I got the Chicken Souvlaki dinner and when the food was ready, the meal was enough to feed two. It's not like the aforementioned places where they pinch out on everything; salad is mostly lettuce, 2 slices of tomatos, 2 cucumbers and 3 potatoes and the chicken. At Zet's I got a huge plate full of a delicious salad with a generous amount of cucumers and tomato's, because no one gives a damn about lettuce, it's a waste of space to me. The potatoes were also generous and massive, I had trouble finishing the meal. It also came with a bread roll, unlike any other Greek food joint. The chicken was very flavourful, juicy and tender, not dry and bland like a majority of the other places I've had Greek food. This was probably the best Greek food I've ever had, and definitely the closest to authentic food from their homeland. I need to go there again soon."}
{"text":"The many fews time Ive been here Ive been here past midnight and the burgers here are always on point!! Ive never had a bad experience with this place ive enjoyed it everytime. 

They have water in a pitcher if your thirsty and you can get it yourself. I love that so you dont have to wait for a waiter or waitress to serve you water."}
{"text":"Came here twice: once for dinner and once for lunch. ONLY EXCEPTS CASH.


Ordered:
-10oz steak dinner. Asked for it medium rare
-chicken souvlaki dinner with an extra stick of pork; fries instead of potatos and Caesar instead of greek salad

Expectations:
-amazing food (from many review)
-steak was how I asked for, as well as it being nice and tender
-salad dressed properly
-fries crispy 
-rice should not be over cooked
-bread should be toasted 
-both pork and chicken sticks should be cooked but still juicy 

Reality:
Let's start with the good part about both of my meals. The rice and the fries. Amazing! I know it may seem silly just to come for those items but yes, yes I would come back just for those items. 
Unfortunately those items are the only good things. I was expecting great, amazing meals because of all the great reviews and hype. Both my meats where sooooo dry. My steak was well over done and my salad was dressed to the point where I couldnt even taste the lettuce. The souvlaki was way over cooked, especially since they are using white meat for chicken. Pork was worst then the chicken and thats, that."}
{"text":"I am constantly coming back, I just wish they'd accept cards but oh well. The food is always great !"}
{"text":"Amazing place to attend especially after a late night out or coming in on a late flight."}
{"text":"The food is great but the person cashing you out is not so happy. It's good self serve place. Not bad for the price you pay."}
{"text":"After so many years away from eating at Zet's. It is the same amazing I have always remembered. They really take care to continue to serve top quality, great tasting food. Great to see it is still as popular as it always has been. I highly recommend the chicken souvlaki dinner. You will not leave here hungry. Last night I had the gyro dinner and, again so satisfied. So next time you are by Pearson airport stop it."}
{"text":"Wow. This place looks like it's stuck in the 80's but damn is the food good! $10 gets you one hell of a meal. Bring your appetite because the portions are ridiculously huge. I had their \"famous\" chicken slouvaki and it was good nicely. Came with a platter of salad, rice, potatoes and a bun. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't finish my whole meal. Great value. Bring cash. No credit or debit here."}
{"text":"most just rave about the portions because it's enough food to feed an underdeveloped country. The greek salad is excellent though. They really pack on the sauces and dressing. i work near by so every once in a while you will catch me here. It's a pretty good chance you will need a nap if you come for lunch. Line ups are long during peak hours which is all hours of the day but the service is blazing fast"}
{"text":"Overpriced !
Customer service was terrible. Make you feel rushed while ordering. 

You must try their own tzatziki sauce- strong but great!  

I have had the chicken caesar and cheeseburger  from the 2x I went there. Food tastes ok ."}
{"text":"THE BEST SOUVLAKI I'VE EVER TASTED. It's a great place to try if you're waiting for a flight or after you land, since it is very close to the airport. I had the pork souvlaki meal, and my partner had the chicken - I definitely liked the pork better since the chicken was a little dry but still tasted good. The portions were huge and the flavours were definitely worth the money. Even the bread was fantastic. The only downside is that they only take cash, but they do have an ATM inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Welcome to old school burger shop meets Greek restaurant.  You can get a burger or souvlaki and more.  The burger patties are the cheap, frozen variety and the buns fall apart while your eating.  A plus for these guys is that they have lots of toppings for you to choose from.

The prices are fair and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I went to Zets today and got pick up. I placed the order over the phone and the man was very nice and placed the order Exactly how I wanted it! I got 2 souvlaki dinners, one chicken, one pork and we got greek salad with extra feta and dressing. The food is really good and I really like the Taziki sauce.. it's really potent though, whatever they put in it, it's Delicious but you have to make sure to brush your teeth right after because it is so flavorful and has a strong taste, besides that I really like it!! The pork souvlaki was a bit dry but I put some garlic bbq sauce on it and it tasted really good. I'd order the chicken souvlaki, again and again.. very flavorful and cooked perfectly. The potatoes and rice are decent and the Greek salad was good, I'd definitely come here again and they are open 24 hours! I haven't tried anything else on the menu yet but if they can cook this right, I'm excited to try something different but I couldn't help myself.. because if I come here again, I want the chicken souvlaki dinner. I recommend."}
{"text":"24 hours! All Day Dinner! 

I can imagine my Yelp Friend whispering in my ears.... All Day Dinner! 16oz steak medium rare, you can do it!! But this like 7:30 am not 7:30 pm, though the sky still looked dark. 

Breakfast starts from $5.95 meatless breakfast that includes bottomless coffee, priced like Hong Kong Style Cafe I frequented made me feel at home!

Do I want the meat? Yes I want the meat ($6.95)! 3 big meaty greasy breakfast sausages, really hit the spot!! Toast soaked with butter! Eggs Over Easy! And potato too....

Washing down my greasy breakfast with cups of coffee really gave me a kick start and wake me up a little from just the 2 hours sleep the night before. Hate those early flights!

Nice cooks and cashier addressed me as Ms. Zet's Restaurant is not as ghetto as I expected! 

Cash Only! See the sign at the cash points towards the ATM!"}
{"text":"A great, great place to eat.. was visiting but If I had more time id go back again and again"}
{"text":"Came in here while I was in the airport area to kill some time waiting to pick someone up from a flight.

The long lines indicated that the food must be good!
And it was quite OK I must say.
The portion sizes were HUGE!!
I ordered the Pork Souvlaki on a bun and the pieces of meat were the largest I have seen in this type of sandwich. So large that even I couldn't finish it.
I wish the meat was served in a pita instead because the bun was soaked and soggy so it was not hand holdable but more a fork and knife type of eating.

My wife ordered the dinner portion and again it was huge with generous portions of rice, potato, salad and meat.

I would repeat if I am in the area.
The next time, I will share my order with my dinner partner though..."}
{"text":"Great local spot to catch a bite before your flight. Prices are hood and portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Giant portions and always freshly cooked to order. Great place for no frills kinda service and tasty Greek food. Very casual dining. Most airport employees frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"Food here was pretty decent, the portions were absolutely HUMONGOUS. I got the pork souvlaki on a bun, and after eating 3/4 of it I felt like I was going to explode. HUGE chunks of meat, so you definitely get bang for your buck. I found the pork to be a little bit dry, but that might also be because there was so much and I just got tired of eating after a while.

My friend got the fish and chips and complained that it was too greasy.

It's a good place for people who just want to get a decently priced meal and enjoy large portions. Nothing gourmet, but will fill you up and satisfy you if you're not too picky. Plenty of varied options (steak, souvlaki, breakfast foods, burgers, gyros, etc.) for the hungry.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Very good omelette, huge portions. The place has a diner feel to it and the food looks good. Fries are disappointing, too oily."}
{"text":"Zet's ..good food (No Debit or Credit) 

Parking lot is not very good and the building intself inside and out is very 80's. Its just old lookng. Besides that the food is good, the service is pretty good also. upset they did not take debit or credit. But I have been lots of times. Just sitting and watching the planes fly over and have a souvlaki on a bun with greek salad mm mmmmm. I think this is another restaurant that really gets more talk because of the location, because of the late nights that it is open and because the food is 100% better then any fast food chain. Is it the best ??? No its not, but when ever im close to the airport and hungry this is the spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat if you're by the airport. I got the pork souvlaki dinner... which is huge. I'm pretty sure it serves two.

It was on par but nothing too crazy. The tatziki is home made 

I will come back. I do regret not getting a steak, which is what I think they're popular for."}
{"text":"Great place for the Famous pork souvlaki. Has a great parking lot for a place that is low in supply of it. The food was very well priced great dining room area. No tipping needed. Provides metal cutlery very important for a place that doesn't provide waitressing. The food was the size of my chest and for only 17 dollars"}
{"text":"I heard many great things about this place, and I always wanted to try it every time I drop my relatives at the airport. This place is literally next to the airport, and never knew it was that close to it. After going there once, I figured this was the trick to avoid paying parking at the airport or driving in circles at the airport. At the same time I can have a nice meal before. 

I ordered their famous Chicken Souvlaki Dinner. Yes, it is similar to Jimmy the Greek, but the portion was bigger. The chicken was not bad, it was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside it went really well together with the tzatziki sauce on the side. The salad and roasted potato may seem simple, but it was very delicious and full of flavour.

The environment was like a quick diner/ food court. It felt like a food court because I had to carry my own food on a tray to where I sat. Overall, everything was very good and I plan to go to this place every time I stop by the airport. 

Food: 4/5
Environment: 3/5
Service: 3/5

Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I love this place's vibe - it's a bright, constantly busy diner with huge portion sizes, AND it's 24 hours. However, there's about two vegetarian things on the entire menu, and after awhile you get tired of having pancakes while everyone else has full dinners. I'll still come here every once in awhile, but I wish they could add even one more vegetarian thing to their menu to make it a little more enjoyable for the non-meat eaters out there!"}
{"text":"What you need to know: 
This is a cash only business, they don't accept any other type of payment. It's also a very busy place, usually a small wait for food and they are open 24 hrs!

What you should know: 
Portions sizes are huge and shareable. The burger patties are frozen and not home made, All other meats are fresh (i.e. pork/chicken).. 

What I do know:
Although I go back from time to time, the pork and chicken are always over cooked until dry, I often see the food pre-precooked and re-heated up on the side of the grill. I do enjoy the flavors and the food is good but this is not where you're going to find a juicy and tender meal as much as much as it is plentiful. 

Oh... worth noting for you late night eaters out there, the longer you sit there the more you will think you're on the set of a HBO series that has stars the sweet, the wild and the absurd. So if you're board with Rogers cable choices, you will want to dine in !!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this restaurant on Saturday nights around midnight and it's packed. The line is super long! 

I love how big the portions are here. You really get your money's worth. 

If you're in the area, you should really give this place a try."}
{"text":"Huge portion for the price! Went there with 3 big guys and they couldn't finish their plate. I'm the last one standing with some potatoes left. I ordered the pork souvlaki dinner. It was soooooo good but the pork is a bit dry. Cash only ain't very customer friendly but totally understandable since getting a machine isn't very cheap. 

4 stars is simply because cash only. Will come back before flying out of town!"}
{"text":"Gotta say this place is great!  They are open 24/7 and they always have at least 4 guys preparing food so even though there's usually a long line it goes by quick.  I've had their Burger's (formed patty, but big size, get it with tzatziki sauce), pulled pork (don't ask for too much sauce), and pork souvlaki on a bun (huge).  They are all tasty and big in size.  There are plenty of tables for a diner although sometimes the tables are messy.  The only thing I didn't like was that there is limited parking and they only take cash.  (there is an ATM inside)"}
{"text":"Huge portions. And I mean huge! There's a lot of food for a very fair price.
As for the food, it doesn't look particularly great, but it tastes good. I had the Zet's burger which is actually two quarter pounders with bacon and cheese. A decent burger but very messy to eat, there's so much between the buns it's hard to fit it all in your mouth in one bite.

The souvlaki is tasty, and certainly good value for money. But overall I just felt it wasn't worth more than three stars as even though I liked the food it didn't \"wow\" me.

It is cash only. They do not take credit or debit cards, so make sure you have enough cash on you before you come in."}
{"text":"Soo good and 24/7, so much food ! Every plate is enough for two, I could barely finish mine. Good thing they have take out boxes in the front so you can help yourself (almost like they know you wont finish it...)"}
{"text":"The portions are so crazy. I think I might be dying, and I am a large man. The pork souvlaki on a bun could rival the size of the airplanes next door. So, needless to say, I just ate a 747 of meat. The pork is to die for. Literally. I think I'm dying. The meat sweats are plentiful. So happy I ate here with my wife. My wife knows I am not intimidated easily, but that souvlaki's got me dealing with  meat PTSD, son. I give it a Five all day!!! Oh but heads up, they take cash only. They have an atm if you are cashless because you spent all your money on scratch tickets and mountain dew. We had cash though, because we are ballers who come prepared. The more you know ------*"}
{"text":"Always good food, good service and great value.  Portions are huge....worth two meals.  Must share.  Our favs are chicken n pork souvlaki dinners, grilled hot dogs, poutine and onion rings.  Always busy so budget time"}
{"text":"I've been to Zet's on a number of occasions (including tonight) and each time I'm totally satisfied with my meal. It's always hot and fresh and the portions are amazingly huge. They serve everything from all day breakfast, to burgers, to everything greek. The best part is, it doesn't break the bank and it's open 24/7. It's a casual, diner kind of place but for a quick good bite to eat at any hour, it does the job. Definitely a must try if you haven't already. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here at 4am on a Wednesday night because we were really hungry and everything else was closed. Had amazingly HUGE portions and a lot of choices!! It was surprisingly busy, mostly from workers at the airport. I really liked the place but gave it a 4 cause the pork souvlaki was a bit dry for me ( I had to chew it for a few minutes to digest it lol). The fish & chips were amazing though!!!! I would definitely come back for late night food despite being 30 min away from me!"}
{"text":"this is my second review 
had the pulled pork sandwich, it was by far one of the best pulled pork that i have had in a resturant
5+/5"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak and eggs and was definitely satisfied! Their tziki sauce was bomb dot com! Will definitely come back if ever in the area again. Particularly loved that it was 24hrs. Portions very generous and worth the wait and money!"}
