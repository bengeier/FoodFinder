{"text":"Ever since my trip to the Dominican Republic a few years ago, I have been in hot pursuit of a place that serves tostones. La Taguara is a hidden gem of Madison. The menu offers a wide selection of traditional Venezuelan food at an extremely affordable price. In addition, the staff was extremely kind and helpful. They made sure to explain every dish and answer any questions we had about the menu. The overall venue is a little small, so be sure to plan when you visit or be ready to wait a little if it is crowded. I will most definitely be visiting again, not only to taste some delicious tostones, but to work my way through the absolutely amazing menu."}
{"text":"I've been addicted...yes can't get this food enough! Always so good from brunch to lunch and any other time. So fun to bring others to share the wonderful food."}
{"text":"Had their food for the first time at Willy St Fair and it was hands down the BEST food on the street. Nice people and great food!"}
{"text":"Was very excited for this to come to our neighborhood after seeing yelp reviews for the east Washington location. We ordered take out the day it opened; I got two arepas and my friend got the Mojito en Coco. We walked in to pick up our order...and realized we had called the E Wash location by mistake. The owner was wonderful; he immediately canceled the E Wash order and hurried to get us our food. My arepas were excellent and my friend liked his fish. The price was somewhat more than expected for the fish considering how casual the place was, but it was a huge portion and could easily be two meals.   All in all a great place for take out or a casual lunch or dinner. I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with any order here. Best Cuban sandwich in town;the arepas are scrumptious, love the eggplant one. Plenty of vegetarian options.  Slurp!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The food is great and it always comes out really quickly. The staff is really nice as well. The dining room is a bit small, but the portions definitely aren't."}
{"text":"So in love with this place and their food. This location is warm and cozy; the style of ordering is you approaching the counter with your order and staff bringing out your food.  I normally am an arepa kind of girl (white cheese and literally anything else) but opted for something different since I normally always get arepas. Tip: the sauce is so, so delicious and you just want to douse your arepa in it.  I had the patacón pisao instead, a sandwich made with plantain buns instead of bread or corn. Although it was a little messy and hard to pick up and bite into, it was still absolutely delicious and with the shredded beef, it was a mouthful of delight.   Would definitely recommend the arepas or the patacón pisao or just about anything on the menu because you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So...yeah.... this place is amazing. A humble environment with rich, bold, traditional flavors. I've been meaning to try La Taguara for months but could never convince my self to drive across town. This new location, open for about a month now, was great.  We walked in to a simple dining area with a classic ma and pop shop feel. Everything pointed to a great meal.  I enjoyed the Bandejita Paisa. A wonderful combination of chorizo, grilled steak, fried pork belly, rice, avocado, and red beans. All the meat was cooked perfectly and portion sizes were plentiful. Classic spice blends including cumin, chili powder, garlic, salt, pepper, onion, and cilantro. While flavorful, these spices dont burn your mouth or your bowels :).  We ordered churros for dessert with chocolate sauce. Served fresh and in finger sized pieces. The best churros I've had in Madison.   Gosh why does this place have to be so far from us. Worth the drive and will be frequently visited. These guys aim to provide authentic food and do a great job achieving that goal."}
{"text":"FRESH to the max. Everything down to the cheese is homemade here. It's a relaxed establishment, where you order up front and pay right away. It quant, and on a busy night would be hard to find a table; this is why it's also a great to-go place. We ordered the pabellon, their most popular traditional Venezuelan dish with shredded beef, black beans, plantain, and rice. Juicy and delicious. We also ordered the Mojito en Coco: minced fish marinated in a coconut sauce served with rice, picadillo salad, and crispy green plantain. I didn't pick up on the coconut sauce very much, but the flavor was so savory and contributed to me overeating a lot. Servings are easily 2 meals in my book. My only qualm is not having a super crispy empanada. Otherwise, amazing.  P.S. - After eating, be sure to clean up for yourself and put the dishes in the bus bin."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant lunch! If you're a meat eater the Parrilla Callejera is a bargain and very tasty. Love the green sauce that comes with. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Great place!"}
{"text":"The reviews didn't lie. This place is good. With so many options in Madison, the fact that I would come back here at any time is saying something.   Pabellon - large portion, very flavorful beef, the arepa bun had great flavor and texture.  Patacon Pisao (sandwich with fried green plantains) - I was excited to try a sandwich made with a Venezuelan staple instead of bread, and I chose to go with pork inside. The host mentioned it was a little messy, but delicious, and I'm really glad she recommended it. It has the standard burger condiments on it but the flavors come together in a very different way on this sandwich. Go for it!  The place is small, the staff was friendly, and I wish I lived closer to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really flavorful Venezuelan food.   The Mojito en Coco has a ground tilapia cooked in coconut milk with a kick. Served with rice, tomatoes, and fried plantains (not sweet ones though). I also really like their wings. They're spicy and have some small plantain pieces and a passion fruit sauce mixed in for a sweet/spicy/sour mix.  Because of the Yelp photo attached to this spot we had to have an order of churros for dessert. I really liked their chocolate dip. More of a dark chocolate taste to it so it wasn't overly sweet to go with the already sugared up churro."}
{"text":"This restaurant is such a staple on the east side. First with it being a hop skip away from my residence, but they exceed in wonderful service, friendliness and of course, tasty food. They're arapas are to die for."}
{"text":"Excellent menu all-around: usually very good arepas, and the patacon pisao is a must. Quick takeout times and not one but two outdoor seating areas. Appetizers/sides all worth it. Both locations offer the same quality."}
{"text":"La Taguara is a gem. I feel guilty for not eating at their flagship store after checking out their new spot on E Johnson. The food is delicious and authentic. The interior is bright, colorful, and very clean.  I was warmly greeted by the woman at the counter and she asked if I'd been there before. I told her I hadn't and she gave me some pointers about the menu. I went with the Patacon Pisao with beef and it was AMAZING. I didn't know what to expect (she explained it as a sandwich on a crispy plantain) but it was soooo good.   Will go again and again."}
{"text":"Amazing food, generous portions, good prices and all around a great experience. I'm super excited to find this gem in my neighborhood. The guy at the counter was friendly and even let us sample some of. Their homemade juices. I will definitely be returning to this low key Latino spot for pickup and dine in due to the deliciousness of the food!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint! I ordered the paticon planchada with shredded beef and it was everything I wanted today and then some! I actually tweaked it a little because I ordered it without mayo, ketchup, lettuce, tomato, and onion. I kept it simple because hey, that's what I wanted! The tostones (fried plantains) were giant! They were so good and so perfect I think I just fell in love. They were perfectly crunchy and salted. The beef was also the best I've had it. This really just made my day! The only thing I didn't like was parking, I'm not sure there is parking here so I parked around the corner and down the street which is not a problem but if it was raining or super cold... I'd probably wimp out and drive to their other location which has parking. The guy at the register seemed a little grumpy and impatient but the other staff was really friendly and great!"}
{"text":"Qué rico! This place is amazing. Fast casual but with super authentic and delicious Venezuelan food. The empanadas and arepas are to die for. All ingredients are made fresh. They also have gluten free and vegetarian options. Highly recommend this cozy little hole in the wall. Ps. They have beer"}
{"text":"This place is legit! The food had so much flavor and the sauces they have mmm mmm. Venezuelan food is very good and coming across restaurants that serve this cuisine can be rare, so when you find one please try it and order a few different items so you can get the whole experience!   I had some arepas and empanadas with sides, everything was amazing. The service was super friendly and helpful. Whenever I go to Madison I usually consider eating here, one of my favorite places in town.  Simply put, this is one of the best in the area and worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Nice, intimate Venezuelan restaurant on Madison's near east side.  The food and service were great.  Very personable staff that were eager to explain the menu.  Prices were reasonable and portion size was enough for 2 meals.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"If you haven't yet been here, what are you waiting for?  Stop reading this review and head over, trust me, you won't be sorry!  While I won't claim myself as a Venezuelan food expert, I will say that their food is all incredibly flavorful and delicious. You can't go wrong with any of their dishes but my personal favorite is the Pabellon.  It's an extremely large portion of all things yummy-shredded beef, rice and beans, arepa, plantains.  Make sure you try the salsa/sauce that it comes with-just awesome. The staff are always super friend and helpful with suggestions.  Definitely on the top of the list to hit up whenever we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Delicious food and the friendliest staff!   I came here for a farewell dinner with my wonderful intern and we decided to just go ham on the menu. We each had an arepa (beef with white cheese), and split a side of avocado, an order of tostones, an order of tajadas, and a slice of quesillo.  Arepa: tender shredded beef, a yummy corn shell, and while I thought the avocado would take it up a notch, it's so good that it doesn't need it. As someone who wants to add avocado to most things, this is high praise.   Tostones: crispy and the guasacaca is a perfect accompaniment.   Tajadas: soft and creamy. Couldn't decide if I liked the tostones or the tajadas more. Solution: order both.   Quesillo: I'm not a huge fan of eggy things usually, but the custard was ultra-silky and the rich egg worked to balance the super-sweet caramel topping.   So glad LT opened a location that's even closer to downtown and I love how bright the interior is. You can seat yourself and order at the counter and the staff is more than happy to walk you through the menu. The gentleman that helped us was able to explain every dish and make suggestions and exuded pride for the restaurant and Venezuelan culture.   La Taguara is a definite asset to the East Johnson neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'm typically not one for Mexican food, but this place is delicious and a true hidden gem in the neighborhood! Make sure to check out their lunch specials and try their juices!"}
{"text":"Fuego Alert! Best meal I've had in a while, and that's how I felt last time I ate here!!"}
{"text":"La Tagura offers what I assume to be authentic Venezuelan cuisine.  We tried the two most popular entrees: Cachapa con Queso y Cochino Frito and Pabellon.  Portions are very generous and more than enough for two hungry people.  Everything on the Pabellon plate was delicious and flavorful (beef, rice, beans, plantains and the arepa) and we added the egg which was a nice addition, texture-wise.  My husband loved the cachapa (sweet corn cake with melted cheese), but it was too heavy and cheesy for me.  The crispy pork on the side was incredible though.  It's order at the counter service, but we sat down briefly to look at the menu after getting some recommendations.  Overall, the service was quick and helpful.  We'll definitely be back to try some other things."}
{"text":"Probably a 4.5 star but need to round up for the fact that they're the only Venezuelan place in Madison.  Had been wanting to try the East Washington location for a while but never wanted to make the drive.  Been here twice for lunch now and both times it was awesome.  1st time I got the full-bore Pabellon entree, and the second time I got a lunch special (arepa+empanada+soup).  Both were awesome.  Lots of options on the lunch specials which are priced right and will fill you up."}
{"text":"Really friendly workers, good customer service, and good food. Twas my first time trying Venezuelan food. I highly recommend going"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food was reasonably quick and very fresh. The staff was friendly and informative. Price was fair. I'll definitely be back to try more varieties."}
{"text":"The \"papi venezolano\" was a good way to try a bunch of the apps - empanadas and cheese masa balls were our favorites. The yucca was a little undercooked unfortunately. Also had the arepa filled with pernil - quite good - and the pabellon -wish the rice had been more moist but the meat tasted good. Great service and cute spot overall!"}
{"text":"When I first went to La Taguara, I honestly didn't know what to expect. I have never tried Venezuelan food before and I wasn't quite sure on what to order. This restaurant was incredible. The decor was small, yet cozy, while offering some delicious options. The service was alright, but since you order at the counter, there was not much interaction.  I ordered the Cubano sandwich which was LOADED. It was a sandwich that had pressed french bread filled with ham, pernil (pork roast), pickles, mustard and swiss cheese served with a side of plantain chips and guasacaca. I mean man, it was a lot of meat, but it was delicious. The different flavors blended well together and tasted great. I even tried a dessert of churros and chocolate which completed the meal. This place is defintely a local gem."}
{"text":"I walked in expecting table service, and discovered that you order at the counter. Don't let that dissuade you! Besides, someone brings the food to your table when it's ready. I recommend the tequenos for an appetizer and the pabellon (Venezuelan National Dish), which can be made vegetarian, as an entree. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Casual and intimate. We'd be back for sure!  We had two arepas and a patacon pisao, all delicious and reasonably priced. My wife is vegetarian and loved the shredded eggplant in the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Loved my lunch here and will definitely be back for more! The location is casual and cozy, you order up front and the food is brought out to you. The gentleman taking our order was very kind and patient, and took the time to explain the various specialities on the menu that we didn't understand.   I had an arepa meal with the soup of the day. I ordered the pernil (pork) arepa with white cheese, which was absolutely delicious along with the salsa verde. The soup (chicken with arepa dough) was decent, but my favorite part of the meal was the passionfruit juice. My friend ordered a pastelito lunch which she also loved. The prices were reasonable enough. All in all, a great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Really really really good! I would stop here again in a heartbeat. Get yourself a glass of the passion fruit juice and some fried yucca. Everything my group tried was so good."}
{"text":"Such a delicious and fun lunch we debated changing our road trip route to eat here again. Our party of five tried lots of things--fried banana sandwich, pork plate, shrimp salad, chicken soup, arepas and empanadas, and sweet fried plantains--pretty much all of them the type of weird/awesome burst of flavor that make your eyes get wide on first bite. The guy at the counter was super helpful and gave us some hot sauce that lit me on fire in a great way."}
