{"text":"This is truly a Hidden Gem! A co-worker and I were walking by and were impressed by the many sauce options on the menu. We stopped in and were extremely pleased with the outstanding service, the amazing food, and the incredible price."}
{"text":"So good! We've been looking for good pasta for a long time and finally found it. Not fancy but real and good and friendly service. Didn't have a reservation because we didn't know how popular it was but we managed to get squeezed in if we promised to be a little quick- so glad we got to try them out. Yum yum yum. Gnocchi, Gigi sauce and eggplant Parma were delish!"}
{"text":"Ate there with my family on vacation in Montreal. The food was delicious! We ate every bit of all four plates and dessert. The service was outstanding and very friendly. I would highly recommend this place if you're in this area of Montreal looking for good Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"This is a very cute small amazing find.  The food was the best home cooked Italian food I have had.  Nothing taste frozen or pre cooked, you could taste lots of flavor in everything.  If I had to pick a complaint it would not be about the food, the wine/bar list was very limited and could be expanded.    But I went with my hubby for a good quiet dinner not a nite of drinking.  Definitely will return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"When ordering, I couldn't decide between penne vodka or Fettuccini Alfredo. The waiter said, \"No problem! I can put in a half order of each!\". Sounded great. Then I got the bill and realized he failed to mention it would be $7 extra for this.... Also I never once received a refill on my water which was my only beverage. Once we received our food, the waiter never came back until he brought the bill. The food was very good but service was not."}
{"text":"Good food, but an unfriendly welcome at the door when we came a month ago.  We walked in (two young girls, appropriately dressed, reservation already made) and were left standing in the doorway for over five minutes.  No one else was waiting, and it did not appear busy at all.  There were two hosts/servers chatting by the register, occasionally looking over at us (as I tried to get them to acknowledge me), but neither gestured to or made any attempt to greet us.  One of them finally came over to seat us, as if nothing had happened, and after that service was fine.  I couldn't tell if it was because they weren't taking us seriously (we were by far the youngest diners that evening) but even so, we were paying customers."}
{"text":"Great pasta, loved the servers. Would recommend to anyone wanting a delicious Italian meal that's not expensive."}
{"text":"Nice lunch. Came for a business meeting and had some enjoyable calamari and Penne all'Arrabbiata washed down with some nice wine and a shortcake desert. Nothing out of the ordinary though."}
{"text":"Our first night in Montreal and went here around 6:00 without reservations.  Fortunately there were a number of empty tables (that changed within the next half hour as the restaurant filled shortly after we arrived).  We were seated immedtiately.  We had 2 servers, one was friendly and helpful, the other barely made eye contact.  Salads arrived shortly after we ordered and we're quite tasty.  Our meals were good, but not exceptional.  My veal with a cognac based sauce was good, but was light on the veal portion.  My wife's seafood pasta was one of the specials.  The seafood (clams and mussels) was bland. The wine selection was between a drinkable house red and 2 house whites (a nice pinit grigio).  Our major disappointment came after we were served when our servers never checked back on us.  Our dishes were cleared after we finish and we then sat for 20 minutes with our empty wine glasses (which had been empty about halfway through our meals).  We declined dessert when our server finally retuned."}
{"text":"This small and cozy restaurant on Stanley Street between Rene LÃ©vesque and Saint-Catherine offers a fine Italian cuisine. The menu is at a very low price and the food is beyond excellent. I ordered an garlic angel spaghetti and a cappuccino. The pasta was excellent as good as the pasta my nonna makes and the cappuccino was strong and delicious. I totally recommend this place, you could eat there, it's cozy and casual with excellent service or take it to go. This place absolutely deserves a 5 stars."}
{"text":"Warning - The DUO is expensive. ~$30  The only reason I did not give this restaurant 5 stars is because we were not warned of that and felt blindsided. Otherwise, this place is great. The pasta and sauce are quality."}
{"text":"What a stupid place.... called the place for a take out order and they hung up on me three times!!! Then finally someone comes on and says they are busy and can't take the order!!!! Why not say it the first time??? Total understandable."}
{"text":"My friend & I were in Montreal for a concert at the Bell Centre and this restaurant was nice and close. We thought with the reviews that it would be a really good experience. Unfortunately it wasn't. I ordered the carbonara and it was very bland. I actually had to add salt which, when a meal is seasoned well, one should not have to do. My friend's lasagna was just mediocre and for the price, we expected a lot more. Most pasta dishes are around $20 so for that price, the flavours should be exceptional. Also, there wasn't a full wine menu, so we just asked for a glass of the house wine and we were charged $10 each for a very small glass. The service was okay, and they were pretty quick (maybe that's why the flavours weren't out of this world... ) and they were polite.  I would rather have gone to the small little mom & pop resto that we passed as we left this resto. Oh well, live & learn."}
{"text":"We got here around 6pm on Saturday 2/4/17 and there was only one other table seated. I was worried that the reviews I had read were wrong and that this was going to be a horrible experience...THANKFULLY I was wrong! The wait staff seated us (3 kids 3 adults) and promptly took our orders. They suggested items and were very accommodating with the kids orders. Food was delivered very timely and everything was delicious! Everyone left full and happy!"}
{"text":"I loved this little restaurant. We went there during lunch break and service was on point, and so was the food. It's always hard when you bring 10 people to a place, you never know if someone will complain - especially when you bring Italians, then the food is never as good as the original. This time, my Italian colleague said the food was delicious, but couldn't be compared to his mom's! My coworkers ended up being happy about the place. Prices are fine during lunch (I noticed the dinner menu seems more expensive). I had their spaghetti with tomato sauce. My colleagues tried everything else there was to try, mostly meals with pasta and cheese, and they thought it was really good. I remember that the soup was a little too salty, but otherwise the food was great and fresh. It's not too far from the La Gauchetiere. I think it's one of the few good restaurants close to work."}
{"text":"Cozy intimate restaurant with fresh homemade pasta!  We were second to arrive in the restaurant at 5:10 and the restaurant was full by 7pm on a rainy Wednesday evening. We were so thankful to find this tasteful Italian restaurant in Centre Ville on Yelp. Our server spoke minimal English but was attentive without us having to wait too long in between courses.   We began our experience by letting our server know that we were famished and he promptly brought us 2 orders of chicken wings. I thought this would be weird in an Italian restaurant but it was actually delicious.   Chianti Is served by the glass as well as beer and some cocktails.  I had the Caesar Salad as a starter and it came with a nice light dressing with crispy lettuce and homemade baguette croutons. There were 3 of us so we ordered the lasagna, fettuccine and papalina (penne with tomato sauce). I loved the lasagna the best but gobbled every bite of my own pasta with a rich creamy sauce with fresh button mushrooms and ham.   You've got to try the Tiramisu, I thought it was one of the best I've had. Pair it with a Cappuccino and you've got a PERFECT end to a day in Montreal."}
{"text":"Very good food for an extremely good price. Best is Pasta Bolognese. Service was friendly and food came fast. Good portions for lunch or dinner, can't complain. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We tried the seafood linguini, lasagna and calamari.  Tomato sauce was rich and perfectly balanced--no acidity.  The linguini was cooked perfectly--al dente.  Seafood items were plentiful..clams, mussels. The bread that came with the meal was fresh with the right amount of chew.  Service was les than stellar..we arrived at 8:30 to a pretty full restaurant. Our starter calamari was brought out with our mains.. our waiter was MIA for most of our meal and when he did appear was intent on rushing us through our meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The veal Franchise was outstanding! Super thin and melted on my tongue. My parents had the pasta and theirs was great as well. We all practically licked our plate clean. Even the bread was good. Highly recommend! Great service too."}
{"text":"So great! I had fresh caught cod. The minestrone is elegant and comforting. Service great. Prices are great. Atmosphere is nice- music and table cloths. Extensive menu - Italian. Flavorful food salted just right. Portions are  perfect  . Bread- sooo good"}
{"text":"I had veal tortellini. My friend had fish. Appetizers inclu"}
{"text":"i read the Yelp articels here and i have to say Wow what great food to great price , friendly causy place , definitly i cone back yummmy yumy"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant because of the lack of reviews but we decided to do a walk by, and the restaurant was almost packed! The waiters were very helpful and nice, the food was super delicious, I had the gnocchi and the minestrone soup, the soup was very tasty yet light and the gnocchi was super fresh and covered in a delicious sauce.  The strawberry tart was interesting, it was a strawberry jello made with real strawberries, a custard and the crust, not to sweet and perfect way to end the meal."}
{"text":"I have owned 2 restaurants and cooked my whole life. When I make a special dish, that came out Perfect, I tell those I am serving it to: You might not like when you're about to eat and that's entirely fine because everyone's tastes are different.  But like it or not, This is what it's supposed to taste like!! At Cafe Bistro La Marinara, This is what it's suppose to taste like!! Layout, Design, Staff, Value, Food and Desserts were all exceptional. If I ever go back to Montreal, this place will be 75% of the reason why I did. Bravo!!!! PS, I rarely give 5 Stars PPS, Thank you Yelp, because this place has NO Web presence and without you, I would have never found it.  My Hotel Concierge sent us elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Great food. We just ordered from their list of specials which gave a choice of appetizer, entree, and desert for under $30. Everything was so delicious that we went back the next night."}
{"text":"I can't imagine a better Italian restaurant, this was by far one of the best meals I have ever had.  The sauce is perfectly prepared, the service attentive and the wine selection is excellent."}
{"text":"My family and I were on vacation in Montreal. The food was delicious. Ask for the specials if you don't see a notice (small white paper) tucked in your menu. They will happily explain and translate the specials for you (that small paper is in French). The service was outstanding and very friendly. Small store front, but long inside and plenty of seating in back. No outdoor seating, very asked. They let you view the desserts too. No idea if they have WiFi inside. I would highly recommend this place if you're in this area of Montreal looking for good Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"This place had good service and delicious food. The spaghetti carbonara was fantastic. The minestrone was also good. Overall a very satisfying meal. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great service, the server was fun and caring. Always made sure we have bread on our table and water glasses are full.  The food was good too. The snails that we ordered as starter were especially good. The dish was rich and creamy, and mushrooms and snails are great companies. however, the portion size was relatively small.  I got the penne pasta also, al dente, the texture was really enjoyable.  I will go back to try some more!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a friend of mine. Prices are a bit on the high side - should be $$$ instead of $$. Food was delicious and service was adequate."}
{"text":"Excellent food, slow but very friendly helpful service. Open kitchen. The Resturant is always full."}
{"text":"Let me first say we were walking from our hotel by the restaurant and had intentions of having a nice family dinner at Rueben's on St Catherine.  My wife and I are huge supporters of small Italian restaurants that serve fresh flavorful Italian food and have a nice warm \"chaleuruse\" feeling.  Let me declare that CBLM has done a wonderful job in this regard.  I ordered the Seafood Fettuccine. It was offered in a red sauce or light (natural sauce). I chose the natural sauce. It had a wonderful medley of shrimp, clams, mussels, calimari. It was prepared in a light amount of garlic and was really tasty!  My wife ordered the small plate version of Penne Arribiatta and daughters shared a regular regular spaghetti meat sauce.  Wife mentioned the Arribiatta was very good, not wonderful, not bad and daughters were very happy with the spaghetti! When I was finishing my dish one of the chefs asked if I would like some more. I clearly thanked him but said it was fine. Rarely am I offered this! Wow!   The restaurant is a bit on the smaller side but this made it more cosy. We had a wonderful experience and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Visiting from New York City on business. Staying at the Lowes hotel, which is about 5 blocks walking distance. Braved the cold 20-degrees and carried it all the way back to my hotel room. Still arrived piping hot. Ordered the veal parm with spaghetti and caesars salad. Salad was crisp, lightly seasoned. The veal parm was still warm, felt like they just made it as I arrived for pickup. Veal was tender and succulent. Very happy with the texture, and seasoning. However the sauce was a little bland. Only negative I could find. The thin spaghetti was al dente, maybe a touch undercooked. But I ate it and was somewhat satisfied. Overall, for my first Italian take out in Montreal I came away satisfied. But I'm still on the lookout for \"my go to\" Italian spot the next time I'm in town for business."}
{"text":"Ordered the escargot, was cooked well and in a delicious sauce. My husband had the Spaghetti with meat sauce and I had the Linguine with Clams in white sauce. Both were fantastic. My husband said their meat sauce was better than what he makes. Highly recommend for both food and service."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, my wife had the zucchini appetizer and describe it as the best zucchini app she had ever had! My meal was fantastic, started with snails then a veal dish and it was incredible. Food wise, 5 stars but the service was only a 2, fairly nice but far too busy with only 3 servers working the whole restaurant, the poor service ended up making the dinner not very enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the waiter was very friendly. Only criticism that I have is the lack of cleanliness in the restroom. Overall good place to eat though."}
{"text":"The main course was a very tasty  cod primavera , others had various pasta dishes that were also very tasty , my chocolate mousse was very good (not chocolate pudding as u get in some resto's)... Only bad note was the antipasto a Caesar salad ..not .. Please iceberg lettuce with croton & oil dressing isn't Cesar(not the only place to do this)  Came as a big group so service was a bit spotty but excusable and friendliness made up for it   General complaints about most Italian resto's in town. Wine & Cafe is great but Ruin a good meal with crappy Tea quality & service or not having Chinotto (Brio)"}
{"text":"Great looking non descript location.  Sometimes it appears dead... don't be fooled this place gets busy.  It's a great local."}
{"text":"We selected Cafe Bistro La Marinara because it was close to our hotel. We were wonderfully surprised at the spectacular meal and warm servers. The comfortable atmosphere added to experience. My wife said the gnocchi was the best she ever tasted. We ordered a litre of the house red and it was a delight."}
{"text":"After a week of eating French food and pub fare I was in the mood for some Italian food. After reviewing the local offerings on Yelp we decided to go to CafÃ© Bistro La Marinara. After a short walk from our hotel we found the place. We were warmly greeted and promptly seated.  Our waiter was very attentive and brought our drinks out while we looked over the menu. We were both in the mood for veal. I ordered the scallopini and my wife had the veal parm and spaghetti. Each main course came with a salad which was also very good. The bread on the table was warm and was good with the wine and salad while we waited for our main course. The veal was properly prepared and was tender enough to cut with a fork. The pasta was a perfect al dente.  If we lived in the area I could see making this my go to Italian restaurant. If you're visiting Montreal give them a try. I'm glad I did!"}
{"text":"L'endroit n'est ni particuliÃ¨rement joli ni rebutant et la cuisine n'est pas particuliÃ¨rement inventive ni goÃ»teuse. Italien plutÃ´t standard comme on en trouve sans que ce soit particuliÃ¨rement difficile. Pas particuliÃ¨rement impressionnÃ© sauf par l'addition du lunch pour 2 Ã  75$ + service que j'ai trouvÃ© particuliÃ¨rement Ã©levÃ©e pour ce qu'on a eu, sans vin. Heureusement que ce n'est pas moi qui rÃ©glait.  Je n'y retournerais pas particuliÃ¨rement."}
{"text":"We were visiting from the U.S and decided to stop in here. We were not disappointed. It was absolutely the best spaghetti i have ever had. The appetizer crustinis with mushroom sauce was unbelievable. The salad was very good, and i liked the creme brulee. Service was outstanding. Our waiter recommended the Moma wine and it complimented our meal very very well. The pictures make it look more casual than it feels, although you could wear whatever, i felt underdressed wearing a tshirt and jeans. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Montreal."}
