{"text":"The space is really bright and beautiful and I really love the concept. The healthy option is well needed in the neighborhood and with a few tweaks I think this could be a space that I frequent.  However the food portions are very small, especially compared to the price. Having to pay extra for each addition as well as the limited amount of options doesn't make me want to run back. Some of the options could use a bit more flavor. Would love it if it was a little more filling and slightly less expensive."}
{"text":"A place like this is great for the community. I went there when it first opened so I imagine it is a work in process but selection/portion sizes were limited and could use more flavour. Add some more sides and seasoning and I'll be back !"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend and had a nice meal. Their name was accurate! We both ordered simple but tasty and wholesome plates of food. I had the brown rice with chickpeas and roasted broccoli topped with a honey mustard sauce, but there were loads of other options to mix and match with.  Each component I ordered was nice. Nothing extraordinary but certainly good.  Could I have cooked the dish at home? Perhaps... But it was tasty nonetheless!  They also had a lot of other stuff on the menu that definitely looked like it would be worth trying (breakfast menu, smoothies, ice cream...).   If you're looking for a nice healthy meal, I think this is a solid spot."}
{"text":"Really good price point for healthy bowls , tasty sauces and a smiling face when you order. What more could you ask for. I got the vegan bowl and just asked them to make me whatever because I've only been here one other time and I really have a hard time ordering food most of the time so it was really nice to get home and enjoy my food!"}
{"text":"Am all about supporting the community and was pumped about them opening but they've made a few grave mistakes many in the area have made. 1.  Prices are high for what you get - $8 for a tiny little chia bowl?  Give me a break. 2.  Don't try to take on Cherry Bomb, you'll die. Try to carve out another niche (roll with the bowls) and don't skimp on portions! I hate to see a business not succeed but just because we have big houses out here doesn't mean we are made of money.  Good luck"}
{"text":"Had a lunch box and Mighty Coffee (bulletproof coffee) on opening day. They were both real good, the food tasting fresh and all the ingredients smelling great. (Had cauliflower rice, brusse sprouts, chicken, and garlic aioli)  Went back the next day for the coffee and one of their baked goods. Both were really good then too, would recommend to people.   One negative was the wait for the coffee both time. Takes a little longer but that may just be getting used to everything and the new routine and things like that. I'm sure once everyone's in the swing of things it'll be fine.   Nice to have a place with this type of menu in the area. A good selection of pantry items too that all look to be of high quality."}
{"text":"Glad you're finally open! Great coffee here, and the bite-size banana muffins are pretty good (even if gluten-free). I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Second visit here and in addition to their fabulous coffee, picked up dinner for everyone at home. Ordered 4 different dishes and everyone loved their meal.  All of us felt full, even my teenage son, and that's no small feat!   Will definitely be back and tell everyone about this fine place so it continues to do well."}
{"text":"Best paleo, healthy non-dairy treats I've ever had. The Simple Kitchen is very simple, literally, with a brunch, lunch, and treats menu as well as merchandise. The focus is paleo, but they have many vegan friendly goods as well, including the paleo vegan Twix bar and peanut butter cup I scarfed down before my emerg shift on a whim just because. The peanut butter cup was very soft and chewy, not overwhelmingly sweet since they used dark chocolate. The dark chocolate here btw does not contain dairy. The treats are also gluten free since they use tapioca and almond flours instead of wheat. Ingredients are listed with the price tags and you can see that treats are made simply with few and wholesome ingredients. Vegans just be aware that some pastries contain eggs. Prices are decent, cheaper than downtown. The chia seed/a√ßai bowls are around $6-8. Lunch boxes are around $10.  Lots of seating inside, which is part of the appeal as I was at Cherry Bomb Coffee right before (literally next door) and that place was so small and so packed I couldn't find a seat.  Will be back for their treats!"}
{"text":"3 to 3.5 stars ... I really love the concept.  Perhaps in reality, not all things sound as good as it does on paper but I still find good Paleo hard to find in Toronto.  I wouldnt have suspected this little subterranean spot would be as sunny as it is.  It's not a large spot but it offers several tables and a few cozy corners to sit.  With a lot of white swatches, it keeps the atmosphere light.  It was relatively clean but a few tables had some leftover food from the previous person.  It was quite busy on a Sunday morning.  Though there was always a table available, many times it was quite full.        This is a fast casual spot so you do line up to order but then you can sit yourself down to any table.  When the food is ready they will bring it to your table.  Ordering is not quick but I suspect it was because they were out of a lot of the items even at 11 am.  They had to explain what was available and what wasn't.  Other than the slow ordering, the service is pleasant.  The menu is paleo which mostly means whole unprocessed foods.  So sugar and flour are considered processed and not available.  During brunch, you have a lot on offer.  You could have a fruit chia bowl, salad, brunch items like cassava flour waffles, and there's boxes with your choice of protein and sides.    Cassava flour waffles with extras of fruit, coconut cream, and granola - These held a lot of promise... gluten free waffles with some nice toppings.  We recently went to Kiin for their brunch and they had an amazing rice flour waffles with tropical fruit.  Simple Kitchen version was lacking in comparison.  I think the cassava flour is unable to produce what you think a waffle should be.  A nice crispy crunch waffled exterior that covers a tender and light interior.  This waffle was heavy... very dense.  It was more like a heavy pound cake texture and it was soft.  Not a single edge was crunchy.  Taste wise, it strongly reminded me of carrot cake without the cream cheese frosting!  The additional extras of the fruit, coconut cream, and granola was an extra $5 and we were kinda surprised you only got a 1 inch sauce cup of each.  It didnt even cover the waffle ... definitely pricey.  Overall, a nice attempt but unfortunately didnt work out. 3/5  Vegan salad - With 2 key items not available, the salad was bordering more on the bland.  They ran out of the sweet potato and squash.  They subbed in zucchini noodles and some broccoli.  With the tomatoes and lettuce, there was good crunch to it but it just was a bit more muted in flavour.  The addition of the warmed chickpeas helped a lot.  Overall, it's not a bad salad but its a bit underwhelming on flavour 3.5/5  I think there's a lot of promise to this place but this time it just didnt work out with the missing ingredients and pricey add ons that didnt even cover the waffles on the plate.  Perhaps there are better items to try."}
{"text":"Healthy eating just got easier with the discovery of The Simple Kitchen located in the heart of Roncesvalles Village in Toronto.  The Simple Kitchen offers a variety of deliciously wholesome meals made with fresh, unprocessed ingredients and superfoods.  The menu is mainly paleo and gluten-free focused with tons of creative menu options such as salads, boxes, smoothies, juices, bone broth, lattes, and much more.  Most of the dishes are also customizable so that you can build-your-own meal using the exact ingredients you want.  I stopped by The Simple Kitchen on a Saturday afternoon and was immediately smitten with the space! The wide window front allows for natural light to really brighten up the cozy space. It was incredibly busy on the sunny afternoon with a line-up of about 15 people ahead of me.  The service was efficient though and staff were working hard to get all of orders made.  I had a chance to briefly chat with restaurant owners Erin Baric and Joe Meireis who made me feel at home amongst the influx of patrons.  They seemed to be very passionate about The Simple Kitchen and you could tell that they put a lot of love into the food they make. After browsing the menu, I decided to go with a turmeric latte which is made with homemade cashew milk and for lunch I went with the Energy Box which consisted of brown rice, Beretta beef, broccoli and avocado.  The portion size of this meal was HUGE and I sort of struggled to finish it all.  The flavours melded together perfectly, especially with the juicy and tender beef and creamy avocado mayo. I was full for at least 6 hours it seemed, it was nice to have such an energizing meal to fuel me for the rest of the day.   The Simple Kitchen also has a mini market area that carries a range of healthy products, coffee beans and packaged snacks. Their shelves feature many well-known brands as well as some exclusive and hard to find gems such as Nut Pods, My Indie Coffee, Simple Mills, Healthy Crunch, Nud, Primal Palate, Siete Paleo Tortilla Chips, Lee's Ghee/Lee's Tea, NuPasta Pasta, Hu Kitchen Chocolate, Joyous Health, Paleo Pantry, and Rawcology.  The Simple Kitchen is truly your best bet for wholesome eats in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I wasn't initially super impressed with The Simple Kitchen, but looking back, they're doing something pretty fabulous. I had a breakfast sandwich and pineapple smoothie, and I didn't even realize I was dining at an all gluten and sugar-free establishment. I'm sadly very wheat-dependent and *I* had no clue! I must return and find out what fine bread they were using.  Beyond the delicious trickery, the restaurant is spacious, the menu is long and the service is kind. The Simple Kitchen is as it states, simple (and a bit pricy), but I will be back."}
