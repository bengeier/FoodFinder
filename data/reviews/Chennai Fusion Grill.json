{"text":"Worst service. Poor management.just ordered a dosa and paratha and waited for 1 hour to hear that they missed the order...we checked twice if the food was ready and none of them came back. After an hour a lady comes to say the order was missed with no remorse or a sorry. We walked off from that place. Don't ever try this place. As far as food is concerned very bad Food and lassi...only Dosa plain dosa is good..which is oily too. Honest suggestion don't eat here."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant as a group of 12 and the food in the buffet is the worst I have tasted in phoenix , they served burnt biryani which is one of the main dishes"}
{"text":"After waiting to try is place for months, I went here with my family for my parent's anniversary. Safe to say I will NOT be going here again. We walked in and the staff was nice in seating us quickly (there were very few people in the restaurant). We ordered gobi manchurian and papdi chaat which were good but the plain dosa was cold by the time it came to our table. We kindly let the server know that the plain dosa was cold, but we ordered a masala dosa too so just to make sure that is not cold. Instead of apologizing or even just saying that it won't be cold, the server went on to say that they don't pre make their food and that once it is made, we bring it out (never once had we indicated anything of that sort). We ignored that and said that's fine and went ahead and didn't cancel our order for the dosa. Of course that dosa was cold too. The whole time at dinner, not once was our water refilled, and so when towards the end of the dinner, once we were done, I asked the guy serving water to refill them. He comes back with the water and tells me how I should have called him to refill it because the place is getting so busy and it slipped his mind (for one thing, I did call him and second, not once did I mention that he lacked in doing what he was supposed to, I simply just asked if he could please refill it). When he did come back with water, he was serving it and my mom who was done with dinner did not want water and simply said, no it's fine, I am good, to which he replied saying, \"TAKE IT, THE WATER IS FREE\" I didn't say anything then to try to not be rude, but to that man, learn to respect your elders and paying customers. If you need a couple pointers, I can come give them to you, FOR FREE.  They have definitely lost my business and I will make sure to let our other friends and family in this area know as well. They need to learn what customer service is."}
{"text":"Delicious food however would like to see the prices a little lower, especially for carry out"}
{"text":"If you like South Indian food, you will love this place. I generally avoid buffet and eat-ins at Indian restaurants but have never gone wrong with take out here. The food is fresh and authentic. They have the best goat biryani in the east valley. Our  typical order is Madran Fish Fry, Veg Pakora, Goat Biryani, Butter Chicken (for the kids), Kothuporotta, Goat curry and Chennai special chicken varutha curry. The only complaint I would have is that for some reason the butter chicken quantity is always a bit small (tastes good though). Hope this place sticks around for a while. That is always an issue with Indian restaurants. We are doing our part..."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very good south and north Indian dishes.  The only bad thing is that the service is very poor. The staff is not focused and very immature else I would give a 5 Star review, however the food deserves a 6 Star out of 5. The waiters do not come and ask if we need anything. Even the menu is not provided quickly when you are seated. You have to search for the staff and waive or literally yell at them to get their attention.   I hope the food quality remains the same and staff quality improves."}
{"text":"The standards of Indian food in chandler are already agonizingly low but chennai grill does nothing to rise above them. The butter chicken and garlic naan were edible but had no lasting flavor. The chutneys, on the other hand, had a very strange texture and flavor (almost tasting like they had gone bad). I wouldn't say this restaurant is the worst I've been to in the area, but there's certainly nothing special about it and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I went to both buffet and Ã  la carte both were good. I liked the butter naan bread very much which is soft and biryani is also good here."}
{"text":"We went for dinner along with my pregnant wife. They made us wait for an hour for a simple panneer Tikka order. We kept asking and the waiter came back saying that the fid will be ready soon. After an hour, the owner lady comes and says \"system problem and your order did not get punched in\". Not a feeling of remorse; no sorry nothing. We got feed up with the attitude and decided to leave. The owner still did not feel sorry for the delay. I feel sorry for taking my pregnant wife to this place.   Mistakes happen but they don't even have the guts to own it up and feel sorry. Never again to this place!!!"}
{"text":"I Will Definitely give Five Stars to this Place.What a Great variety of Best food they have.I Love the food every time whenever I visit.I Like their Gobbi Manchurian very much and today When I went they had Mushroom Manchurian which was super tasty. I will definitely recommend their Chicken curry, Idli, Kal Dosa.However..Their Deserts like GulabJamun, MangoHalva are so delicious and very  yummy for kids.My 4 years and almost 2 years old Love to eat Deserts here.My Mom came From India and She also Love this place.According to my Choice, This is the Only Best South Indian Restaurant which has a combination of  great taste and vary varities so far anybody can have cravy for it once enter into this place..Even Staff is so Friendly and Welcoming.so why wait Go and Enjoy ...Super Food, Super Taste and Super Restaurant."}
{"text":"Would not honor a valid coupon from the Entertainment Book.  Coupon was for one free entree when you buy two entrees - up to $13 value.  Server said that the system would not let her enter the coupon unless one of the entrees was over $13.  I argued that was not what the coupon said and she agreed but said there was nothing she could do.  Shady."}
{"text":"I ordered Biryani and that is not called biryani in any part of the world..They seem to take everyone for granted. Cooke rice and later mixed some meat in the rice and call its biryani. Never going back there ever again . stay away from this place travellers esp if you are from bay area where biryani is done right."}
{"text":"Weekday and weekend buffet.  Lots of folks have wrote a lot of details, so I'll keep mine very short - AWESOME! Love the chicken dishes and desert choices. Also, on Fri-Sun, there's always something special available -- once there was Pav Bhaji w/buns and another time there was Chole Bhatura. Outstanding!  I've been there on their opening and several times since. Very consistent quality. Service is good too, in terms of bringing out naans and dosas.   Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"good ambience..  Good food.. Good service..  Hot and good food..  One of the best places in Tempe for very good Indian food"}
{"text":"Overall experience was not good . Went on a Friday evening, it was completely filled, the AC was not working. It was very hot inside. The food was served Very late. Overall the food was ok but the roti was very hard and not good."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on their opening day, and since then have been going again and again !! Being vegetarians, their menu has a wide spread choice for us and everything tastes yummy yummy ! Lunch buffet has a many choices for appetizers, curries and desserts. they generally have a central piece special dish like Poori - Bhaji or Pav bhaji. Naan and Dosa served onto the table will be hot.  Nothing more to say.. Currently this ranks #1 in Taste, ambiance, service etc.. Thumbs up to this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far the best Indian cuisine in the area. The lunch buffet is filled with a wide variety. Masala is delicious and their food definitely crunched my curry craving. The staff running it are also very nice, they treat you like a guest in their own home. One of my new favorite stops for sure."}
{"text":"Me and my husband have been there many times and we love their food. The lunch buffet is amazing with so many options to select from."}
{"text":"Wrost chicken 65 ever I told them over it's over fried and old left over chicken they really don't know what is chicken 65."}
{"text":"After the recent change in management at this restaurant which happened a couple of months back, the food at this restaurant has become absolutely amazing. My recent visit was on 20 May 2016 and I totally loved the food here. We had ordered a combo of Veg and Non-veg dishes: 1. Panneer Tikka (dry) 2. Malai Kofta 3. Kadai Chicken 4. Chicken Vartha curry  5. Malabar porotta with chicken saalana 6. bread basket Each and every item that we ordered were absolutely fantastic. In my last 3+ years of staying in Phoenix, all indian restaurants here have disappointed me in either all or certain aspects. But, chennai fusion grill just blew my mind especially during my last visit. And to sweeten things further, we were even given freshly prepared complementary Jalebis which again were awesome !! Please note, I was not hungry when I had stepped into this restaurant and I was planning to have something very light. But, the food was too good to let it pass and so I stuffed myself :) Hence the reason for this happy and frank review from my end.  @Chennai Fusion Grill -- Please keep up the good job you guys are doing !!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant and I really wish I could give a better review. It started off as a nice place for lunch. It had a really awesome buffet so you could get little bits of everything. In the evenings when you could order off the menu their food was too notch. They had the absolute best vindaloo. Recently however both the service and food quality has gone down hill hard. The last time we went we got seated after a few minutes, ok, no problem, but they didn't give us any menus. Weird, but ok maybe they think that since we're regulars we don't need them. It took awhile, but they came over to take our drink orders, but then never brought it out. Then the staff proceeded to leave the restaurant for a bit. When they came back in from wherever they were still pointedly ignoring us. We weren't the only people there either and we were there at 6, definitely not during a time when they are trying to close. It was just so disappointing. So we ended up just getting up and leaving after close to 30 minutes.  I really wish I could still recommend this place, but for now I'd suggest finding a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Gotta say this place was a great little find. The food is so fresh and so worth it. Only thing is they took a little long to get us water and to bring our food. Otherwise the waitress described the food on par and the taste was authentic and fantastic."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant ever! I have gone back several times in one week for just for the tandoori chicken and chicken biryani. Everything I have tried to date has been amazing, including dosas and curries. I have brought my friends, family, and coworkers here and they completely agree! I get thanked for recommending this place. The staff is very nice and accommodating, especially for large groups. The weekend buffets are also a must try, with new varieties every time and always fresh!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food. They had special \"chai\" other than gulab jamuns in desert (which I loved the most), sweet pongal etc in buffet. Mutton biriyani, chicken makhani, egg fry, aloo fry are worth a try."}
{"text":"Being from Chicagoland area I can't say how this store stacks up to other local Indian establishments.  But my first effort to find one near my hotel was a total hit.  I'm beginning to wonder if a greater proportion of patrons who are native to the cuisine is a good indicator as found here.  The waitress was very helpful identifying ingredients & levels of heat.  The buffet was hot & the food very tasty.  Indian is becoming my favorite taste sensation for a few reasons.  For one, it's so simple to get a couple of your servings of vegetables in one place.  I tried a beet combo & found it quite delicious.  The chicken couldn't have been more tender.  An only legitimate complaint would be that this food is so good you can very easily overeat.  So I'll be back here just as soon as possible & just wear my belt one hole too big."}
{"text":"I usually go here couple of times a month.  Food is generally okay, some times all dishes are chicken no goat, which is disappointing.  I also find tandoori chicken cold when I am there at 11am, food should be hot.  Last time I was there I heard a manager yell to the employee from kitchen for not taking dosa on time, it really made that employee feel bad. This is no way to treat your employees.  When it's time to pay, they have difficult time to ring your order, seems like they have terrible order system, please throw away that high tech looking white register, it confuses your employees.  Your buffet prices are high, at least one item should be goat or lamb."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant these days. Food is as authentic as it gets. Their indo Chinese combo is really nice and fried rice reminds me of my days spent in my undergrad dhabha. Great chef"}
{"text":"Extremely poor quality food. I ordered medhu wada, it had around 30 whole black papper in a single wada! No kidding!! They served wada but didn't serve sambaar..we had to wait for a while for sambaar. Aaloo papadi chaat was simply yogurt poured on papadi! Huh..very disappointing. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice and each time has been a not so appealing experience. The service is slow and inefficient. Very well acquainted with the Indian cuisine, I found the food to be highly average. First time, I reached 15 minutes before the noon closing time. They said we can't sit and eat. That's fair but I asked if I could take a parcel (as I saw quite a few people still eating) and the answer was still no. That felt rude. Second time, I walked in and the place was empty except for 3 tables. It took forever for the waiter to arrive and note our order for a samosa plate without chaat. Even if I did ignore the lousy service, I couldn't ignore the food. Samosas seemed stale and had higher quantity of turmeric powder which in turn ruined the taste. Nonetheless, I liked the partially covered seating on the left as you walk in."}
{"text":"This is for a la carte - Good taste, clean, nice ambience. Excellent tomato soup, chola bhatura, dosas, veg biryani. Punjabi dishes, other south indian items are okay, pakodas, dahi wada were not good. Good service, sometimes lazy."}
{"text":"An amazingly good Indian buffet for lunch is a recipe for a smiley and exhaustive day. I can't vouch that I was energetic afterwards but I was so happy! Each dish is of quality and doesn't sacrifice because it is on the buffet. The staff was funny and welcoming of everyone, no matter if you're not Indian."}
{"text":"We have been here at least four times and we used to really like the food.  But sadly we noticed the quality of service and food continuously deteriorating! The staff won't pay any attention when customers walk in ... Take forever even to get water on the table and they weren't even super busy. The portions are shrinking too! Not coming back again.  Wear a smile when attending to your customers. Won't cost a thing... BTW you can charge it to us if it costs any!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, they have one of the best lunch buffets we've been to in Phoenix. We eat and gather with friends regularly here outside of the lunch buffet as well and it is just as amazing as the lunch. The staff is very friendly, great atmosphere, and the food will ALWAYS make you happy."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet on a Wednesday. The food was lackluster at best. Service was decent; we were seated promptly and our table was cleared frequently. The food really drags this place down though. To add insult to injury, the tea was burnt. Sad."}
{"text":"12:30  on a Thursday for buffet lunch. Fairly busy with many people who appeared of Indian descent. I was taken to a table that had not been cleaned properly and host/server brushed food off the table onto the ground with his hand. Went up to the buffet  and did not like the small styrofoam cups for soups and desserts. Many dishes differed from the normal Indian buffets around the country I have experienced, hence the Fusion, they feature food from around the country and not just \"Bombay\"style. Food was decent, but far from the best I have had. Plates were never cleared and while I got Naan, the Dosa? Something that looked like a large folded over flour tortilla on most tables, never came. The floor was very sticky which makes me wonder if they properly clean at all. I won't be going back, but if you want to try Indian food that differs from most restaurant offerings, go early to get a clean table."}
{"text":"Thes is my go to place for great Indian cuisine around the Chandler area. The buffet is the way to go because you get all different varieties for a low price of $10.00 (wkdays). Your meal comes with fresh small dosas which is a crepe like item stuffed with a little bit of curry potato. On top of the dosas the waiter also serves fresh naan, you can get regular or garlic. Some of my favorites I choose from the buffet are butter chicken, goat curry, chicken biriyani and on Fridays they serve complimentary lassi. I also golet down with the vegetarian dishes as well. I've never tasted vegetables cooked so right with the perfect mixtire of spices. The spices used in these dishes are used so well you would never miss meat..... well....not that good. LOL  The pickles and chutney they serve on the buffet are also a different sensation. The added sourness, bitterness and spice really compliments the whole meal. When in the Chandler area you should try this place out."}
{"text":"Ate here on Super Bowl Sunday, food was over salty and cold. I was dissappointed after reading all of the fabulous reviews. What made things worse, after we ate we both felt very bloated. Then i started to get a headache which turned into a severe headache. The kind i normally only get from MSG.the headache lasted well into the evening. I was so hoping this indian buffet was going to be great. Now that the all vegetarian south indian buffet in Tempe. Has seemed to lose it way. With the same borning dishes over aand over again. And looks like this place is not going to take its place.   Didnt think Indians used MSG in their food, do they? Well due to the headache and bloated stomache. I dont think i would return. . Perhaps if they change sigificantly i would venture back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Indian Restaurants and one of our favorite restaurants overall. The food is always delicious and the service is great."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the quiet part of West Chandler, If anyone coming from north and taking S Priest Dr/56th along I-10, they will pass through some fields, ranches, thus lunch here is the best part of my work. Almost the seatings are booths, so it is even more casual, relaxing. Music is  normal and not blaring. At times you may ask to turn it down when people start to out-load the music. Typically, environment is comfortable and quiet. And I can go from work PHX and be back in an hour lunch break.  The food - They also have buffet just like any other restaurants and some run-of-the-mill items like chicken Tikka masala, Noodles and fried rice, in case you need options. However 'The Best Part' is after you discovered their specials - there are many dishes that are made authentic, less oily, extremely flavorful and unique. That is the difference - those all don't taste the the same - unlike the typical curry-creamy-oily dishes just in different colors, almost same -  like regular Americanized Indian restaurant buffets. Go A la carte. Or, many times, you hit a jackpot when their those specials appear in their buffet.   The wait staff are awesome, most of them don't provide a typical-wait-staff robatic response, instead you will get personalized response and service. They seems to have a good knowledge about the foods, its pronoenciation, methods of cooking and states where they are consumed, then if you ask, they will enthusiastically point out those items that have unique flavors and their favorites for example, Chittinad Lamb pepper fry. Kaara Kozhumbu (go easy on the roasted garlic),  Ennai Katharikai , Naatu Kozhi Roast. Kal Dosa, Lamb/goat biryani (its different yet delicious).   I wish they make some goat-items as boneless on special request, after a while it gets tired or you can't eat these items with bones when we invade this place with hungry coworkers - it gets sloppier even with a ton of napkins. However, They will customize any item for you, so if you ask the wait staff 'Spicy' with extra stars, you might need a plan to get back home dizzy with lot of  stars.   I give easily 5 stars for this joint, considering the  awesome food, authentic, cozy ambiance and service."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the special dosa and drinks (even took photos so we could try to replicate at home"}
{"text":"I am giving them a 3, purely based on food quality, just based on my experience this time. I have been there quite a few times, never alone. This time, I went for a buffet alone, as I needed some time to think while eating.  I got some good stuff, the biriyani looked awesome. While I kept my silverware correctly to indicate that I am still eating, I needed a trip to the restroom, which was backed up and got late by a few minutes. When I got back the food plate was gone and the table almost cleaned up. There was this entire plate which I was still working on. The wait staff is not trained for what silverware positions mean at a lunch/dinner table.   Had to get another plate. But by then the biriyani was fairly dry, and mostly gone, I typically go there for the biriyani and meat dishes.  Overall, I left after voicing my feedback to the person at the payment counter. Hoping it does not repeats again.  Not sure if this is common for folks who go alone to buffets at times, for me this was the first time. Thought would share this. The food quality here is pretty good, no complaints, but service needs to pick up to be truly very good."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet. Not good. The chicken kabobs were very dry and tough, the chicken curry had bones in it (like seriously, remove the bones people... it f***ing hurts to bite down on a bone shard you weren't expecting), and the overall flavors were just 2 starts. I've had so much better at other places."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst service I have ever had. They forgot to place our order and we ended up waiting more than an hour. The staff was very rude to us claiming that the dish was coming until they realized that they never placed the order. Despite this, they were serving others who had just walked in before they attended to us. They never apologized for their mistake."}
{"text":"I am going to agree to the previous reviews that the food is good at this place. However, I ordered chicken Biryani and it was as bland as it could get. I liked the chicken dish but the Biryani will score 1 out of 10 in my view. So there goes 1 star. I will take off another star because I felt one of their main waiters, a stout women was very rude and impolite while taking our orders. This is the only reason, i am not drawn to coming back to this place. Everything else was better than what i was anticipating."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food. I asked what the fusion meant and they said its a fusion of North and South Indian food. Plenty of spicy options which is big plus for me.  I enjoyed most dishes we had in a big group dinner (along with paneer, dosa and different type naan). They have beer as well (try the hayward 5000 which packs a punch). I have also tried the buffet but have to say dinner was definitely better. Medium price range and the service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"As for me, Musical Chairs is the best restaurant of all.I like music ,especially good music, like classic , so it`s gonna be perfect for me to eat in such a good atmosphere love the food specially dosa delivery was late but I love the food"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Totally got my money's worth! The chilli paneer was especially good! Would recommend this place for a nice Sunday lunch with friends or family."}
{"text":"Our whole family (Mom, dad, 14, 7, and 3 year old) love Chennai! The food is delicious, I've rarely had a dish we didn't enjoy. Not sure how authentic it is, maybe the \"fusion\" part detracts from that, but it doesn't matter in my opinion. Best Indian we've ever had! We visit at least once a week. The staff is so friendly, and they have a nice sweets buffet on the weekend (including Friday)."}
{"text":"I am so confused by this place. We have eaten their lunch buffet twice and had a very pleasant experience but this last time we ate there it was terrible and the service was a joke. When we told the waitress the food was really awful today she just looked at us and said more water and tried to act like she did not speak english and then just walked off. We could not even chew the chicken. Thought we would try the kheer and she brought us a bowl full of rice and milk and sugar and it tasted like a giant bowl of sugar. My toddler could make this. It was all a big joke. Again we told her this taste really bad and she looked at us and said, \"check?\" then walked off not giving a crap about how we felt or how terrible their food was. Over cooked and it all tasted bad and worst of all the service was TERRIBLE. Don't waste your time eating at Chennai Fusion. They do not care. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!!!!!!! 1 of the best chicken tikka masalas I have ever had!!!!!! 10 stars!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am sitting in the restaurant waiting for my to-go order and I just saw one of the guys cleaning the table. He didn't use any cleaners, just wiped it down  with a cloth and pushed the stuff to the floor. No wonder the floors look dirty. They need to train these guys how to run a restaurant.   For dishes ranging from $12-15 this restaurant is very low class. They packed to-go but didn't ask if I needed cutlery or if I needed water while I waited. I was sitting there for 15 mins. I have ordered from Thai Basil next door and they did a better job of serving their customers.  I will not come back even if the food tastes good, though I am worried how clean the kitchen would be after seeing the cleaning of the main area..."}
{"text":"Very delicious home style Indian food. Great Naan and Dosa. Really tasty soups and a whole selection of sweets. Tandoori chicken could be more crisp for my taste. We will be back."}
{"text":"Food is fair, not a lot of thought going into it, standard fare, spicy OK I like spicy some wouldn't like that, maybe menu better. I wouldn't go back, just not exciting enough for a $10 lunch."}
{"text":"To date, we've dined here twice for dinner. This time we ordered Chennai Shrimp Masala, Chicken Tika Masala, Vegetable Briyani and a Garic Naan. For drinks we ordered a Kingfisher Beer and a Diet Coke. Everything was ordered at a spice level of 5 which was mild. Still trying to get their spice level down, next time we'll go a little higher on the spice level. Table service we found is hit or miss here as there's a long time between checking if you needed anything else--which we did. For now, I rated this Restaurant as average as I hope it will improve in time."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet yesterday was sooo good. Delicious food. Aloo Tikki chat was in the buffet :)"}
{"text":"So so good!  The Gobi Manchurian was really good.  Crispy on the outside and tender inside and the sauce was perfect.  My husband also sang the praises of his Chicken Manchurian and Hot &Sour Soup as well.  They also had fresh made Jaleebis that were hands down the best I've found in the valley!  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I wish we could give half stars, because this place is a strong 4 1/2, it's excellent! I've eaten Indian food at many, many restaurants in the valley and this place is by far my favorite. Here's why...  Atmosphere: easy, casual, comfortable. Not overdone, not undergone, basic and clean. I rate the atmosphere an 8 out of 10.  Staff: very friendly, helpful and attentive. Really couldn't ask for more. I rate them a 9 out of 10.  Food: here is where this place shines. All of their food tastes incredibly authentic, the appropriate amount of spice where it's supposed to be, everything is flavorful with unique tastes in the right areas. They offer a huge variety of dishes and desserts, naan, dosas and chutneys with their lunch buffet. Everything is excellent,...fresh, tasty, spicy and each with unique flavors. The buffet is a good value, tons of food, tons of desserts, unlimited everything. I rate the food a 9 1/2 out of 10.  Overall: I've had a favorite Indian restaurant in Gilbert for several years. Chennai Fusion Grill in Chandler is my new hands-down new favorite. I still really like the other place, but this one is better. I've been several times and it never disappoints. Chennai is a must try,....maybe it will become of of your favorite Indian restaurants too. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Best lamb curry I have ever had! Very friendly service, and delicious food overall. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The buffet had lots to offer, unfortunately they weren't refilled. We were abt 2 hours before they close after lunch and they didn't seem to care that there were still customers wanting to be able to enjoy variety. Not sure we're going back to this place. What we did try was ok to good. Plus was they give mini dosa to every customer which is good because the naan on the buffet was hard as a rock. Had to ask and wait for fresh."}
{"text":"Good Indian food. Try the hyderabadi biriyani and bullet naan. Don't try their indo-Chinese."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian buffet. Wide variety of food, often have dishes you won't see on other buffets. Best butter chicken I've ever had; the chicken 65, paneer tikka masala, and kheer are standouts as well. Staff is always friendly. They offer takeout by the pound ($7/lb) and special lunch buffets (street food Tuesday, vegetarian Wednesday, Indo-Chinese Thursday). If you want to save a little money, paying in cash will take a percentage off the bill."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close enough from where I work that's it's extremely convenient to visit. The first time visited the place I was amazed to see the options they had on their lunch buffet. I must admit, the lunch buffet is the only thing I've tasted here, but it is very good. They even have a buffet of desserts from different parts of India. I wouldn't say they do justice to all items on the menu, but it's definitely a good place to quench the thirst for Indian food. The goat is one of my favorite items on the buffet menu, and I definitely think it's one of the better ones I've tasted. Highly recommended place for a Friday lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Overly priced and not much quality. Chicken in the food was smelling and caused uneasiness in the stomach later. (happened thrice, the effect of food here) Noodles ordered during the happy hour was just oil and some noodles with sweet chicken mixed here and there (especially after we asked if it would  be actual indian taste). I guess you can try dosa here, it was good."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. Once for dinner and once for lunch.   The food has been exceptional both times.   The Tandoori, Butter Chicken and Dosa with dipping sauces are delicious.   The lunch buffet is tasty, fresh, very clean (unlike most that are out there) and affordable .   The staff is very polite and always helpful.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Gobi Manchurian Ever.   For those who may not know some of the best Indian food is really Asian fusion, we oped for the happy hour specials. We had a gobi Manchurian, amazing crunchy battered coliflour in a savory spicy red sauce. Be ware the spice level here is set to authentic and delicious.   We also had the noodles with veggies, Think yakisoba with a bit of an Indian twist and a masala doa. All of the flavors were amazing and spicy.  There is tons of seating so getting a table should not be an issue, it is clean, and service is good. Happy hour prices on chaat and other great items make this a top pick if you like food with some heat."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday night and when we walked in it wasn't too busy. We were seated right away and initially given attention. We were given plenty of time to peruse the menu and ordered the paneer pakora for starters. The pakora was good, appeared to be freshly prepared as opposed to freshly taken out of a box from the freezer.  My wife ordered the Indo Chinese fusion fried rice with chicken chili. The portion is huge! Take a dinner plate, make it a bowl and fill it with rice, chicken, and other vegetables and that's what you have. Expect to use a take away box because you won't finish it in one go.  I had the Curry chicken vindaloo, ordered spicy.  It was fresh and spicy and I liked it a lot. You receive a bowl of the chicken vindaloo and a smaller bowl of rice. It doesn't sound like much but it was a lot and I left there feeling very full. The spiciness was exactly where I wanted it to be. If you sweat when eating spicy food, expect to sweat.   The one thing we didn't see on the menu and didn't think of ordering was the service. We had little to no service. Aside from the gentleman who initially sat us down, gave us our water, and took our order, that was essentially the service we got. The food was brought out by the food runner from the kitchen. When he dropped off the pakora, I asked him about our drinks we ordered, since my water has was empty. He went to someone else and they brought us our drinks. When we finished the pakora, the gentleman came around and took our dirty plates and replaced them with dinner platers and that was the last time we saw him until the end of the meal.  When our dinner arrived, it was hot and fresh. A couple of times I saw a woman walk around with a water pitcher after she filled newly sat people's water, though my glass remained dry as a well in summer. Just as we were finishing up, the gentleman offered some water. When it was filled, it was with water from the tap. I have nothing against tap water but in Arizona in the summer, tap water is warm to hot. It was warm with small bits of ice melting away. A small thumbs up for effort there but it wasn't enough.  The lady who filled our water dropped off the check. It always has been my understanding when the server drops off the check in a booklet or on a plate, the server will process the payment. That booklet sat at the end of the table ready to be picked up for the better part of five minutes. Rather than wait any longer, I opted to pay at the take away register. The gentleman, while busy on the phone, quietly mumbled an apology and processed my check.  I liked the food, the service not so much. I would give this place another go. My wife however is less forgiving and I will have to do some convincing of her before she will come back."}
{"text":"I have never been to such a quality great tasting buffet! Not to mention the fact that I've never seen so many options! Everything I had was so flavorful. I can't rave enough about this place. For the longest time I had been going to a different Indian buffet on chandler blvd  (it went down hill in quality & flavor). I then discovered Chennai and there is no turning back! I can't wait to go back for an extraordinary feast. I went with someone who is from India who normally doesn't like to go to Indian food restaurants (no comparison to what she's used to). She loved this place and wants to go back - that says a lot."}
{"text":"This is our 1st time here. Family oriented restaurant. Other table's food look just as good if not better. Makes me want to try each and every food item here. Fast & friendly service.  We ordered the following: #8 Gobi Manchurian-tasted like sweet & sour cauliflower, but cauliflower florets tasted like potatoes (as heard/seen on tv). Very tasty! #48 Kothuparottas with CHICKEN-ordered this influenced by others reviews. Love the yogurt that comes w it. #68 Lamb Curry-delicious as always. #54 Channa Masala-Garbanzo beans. Very good.  All dishes tasted good.  They have at least 4 cooks at the back. Not a job for just one chef."}
{"text":"Good service and friendly atmosphere . .. The food had a perfect balanced of spices and great presentation."}
{"text":"horrible food. we ordered 'dahi papri chat' - chat was missing, only dahi and papri medu vada - was full of black pepper. I found at least 10 in one vada  i wouldnt recommend this place to others and wont go there again"}
{"text":"My husband and I got the lunch buffet, and everything was freaking amazing! The staff were so friendly, answering questions, bringing sauces to try, etc. just a wonderful experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are small and items can be pricey for the size. The tandoori chicken is fantastic. . Got it with the garlic Naan,  which was fluffy and flavorful. Samosas are big,  hot,  and filling.  Good eats all around."}
{"text":"Great chole batura. Unexpectedly good chole, although it could do with another batura. Fried rice was good, though I must say that it had a bit too much carrot. Dosa was abundant and the chutneys were really yum!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Chennai many times.  Their lunchtime buffet has never disappointed me.  The food is hot, fresh, and delicious.   My favorite dishes are the mushroom; the eggplant; and the curried lamb (sorry, but I do not know the proper Indian names for the dishes).  The staff is always polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Loved the lunch buffet here for only $10.50 per person! There were quite a bit of options to choose from and the quality of the food was bomb. I'd say this is better than other Indian buffets I've been to and I'll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Oh MY!!! Yum Yum YUmmo! Have been looking for good Indian since I left Europe to no avail! This place is great!!! Staff is friendly, but honestly I could care less if the waiter called me 100 nasty names in Hindi. As long as the food stays this great, I will return again and again!!! (Does the adorable head bobble for YES!!!) Thank you Chennai and the nice Indian family who suggested this place..."}
{"text":"Had been for afternoon buffet. I whole heartedly savored almost all the vegetarian dishes. I must say it's the best Indian buffet I have tried till date. I especially liked the Bhel puri, they have a unique recipe I believe. Both the south Indian and North Indian delicacies are equally worth the time and money."}
{"text":"I have only had take out from this restaurant and every time the food and staff were great! I had vegetarian options and my boyfriend had lamb vindaloo. The flavor and spice is absolutely perfect! I highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best south Indian food I have had in the valley! I am from Chennai, and I could say that the food was almost as good as a good restaurant back home! We ordered a bunch of food, paper masala roast, the lamb curry , kothuparotta, and roasted eggplant. The masala in the dosa was perfect, not hot, not overpoweringly spicy, just enough to taste the potato mashed. The lamb curry was marinated in what I could imagine was only heaven, and the kothuparotta took me back 15 yrs ago when I stood on the roadside and had the most epic discussions with my friends. Indeed quite authentic! I really thought the quantity of food was small from the photos on yelp, but the kothuparotta was huge, and masala roast was huge too. And let me say that I am a pretty big guy who eats a LOT! And to top it off, the people there genuinely like to serve food ( after all my grandma used to say nothing beats the pleasure of seeing the smile of a satisfied stomach!). The guy who sat us down apologized for a wait delay, when there was hardly not even a minute of standing involved in a moderately busy evening! That was so epic a gesture of hospitality. And the rest of the service was extraordinary ( of course my mouth was stuffed with amazing food, so it barely lifted the head :)). Yes it is a little bit pricey than others, but let me tell you for the amazing quality and quantity, its worth every penny! If you are a chennaite like me missing home food, you should definitely check it out, and even if otherwise its a definite checkout restaurant that you need to cross off your list! I will be back very soon! And I just hope the guys can keep up this high level for years to come! Thank you for the service people! You guys rock!!"}
{"text":"If you have a big appetite and want to have Indian food, this place has the lunch buffet with variety of options. The atmosphere is pretty packed and there are large lines to get the plate. The service is not so quick in clearing the plates or getting us additional things.   It is a decent place for lunch though, their lamb based curries are the best they serve in the buffets. The veggies are alright, mainly it has a lot of oil for my taste. I would not say all the food taste authentic or tasty but its manageable.  Overall an okay place to have lunch which is quiet reasonable for the price they offer. Go early to get seats and hot food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.. lots of variety lots of desserts.. so yummy in the tummy.. definitely worth it"}
{"text":"$10 bucks for lunch buffet.  Wowza ;) I happened upon this place accidentally.  I was meeting a person from the internet in this parking lot to sell them my water cooler and just happened to be HANGRY, naw mean??? So after my sale, naturally I waltzed my hangry ass in there. Perfect timing, because it was about 12:15 and the lunch crowd was just starting to pour in. Just in time to swoop in and get my sampler plate goin before the line backed up.   Score.  So, to start off, the buffet line is pretty big! I've only been in Indian buffets in Mesa, so maybe this is a Chandler thing. Or maybe it's just Chennai Fusion Grill's thing. Either way, the selection of vegetarian and non-veg was decent.   My game plan with all buffets is get one plate and get a small spoonful of every single thing. Back at the table I taste it all and that's how I decide what I'll be mowing down for my money's worth ;) I'm a professional, what can I say.   Initial spoonful sampler plate taste test was a success. I was pleasantly surprised that everything I tasted was REAL delicious. Spices aplenty. Very very tastey. Of course my favorite always ends up being the tikka masala. Or, I think it's palaak tikka masala? (The yummy cheese squares in the tikka masala sauce. NOM NOM)  I did have to wait quite awhile to receive my naan, but that's only because there was just one girl waiting tables and also running cashier. I would assume this is their typical staffing on a weekday at lunch. Not a problem for me since it's my day off and I'm not in a hurry at all. I noticed people had to wait about 5 minutes to cash out as well for the same reason, but nobody seemed upset. It was mostly business people on their lunch break, so maybe they're close by and they've all been here before and they know the drill. Sweet.  Oh!! I'm not usually into Indian desserts, but I was very impressed with their savory recipes, so I did the ol' spoonful plate test with their deserts. There were two rice pudding type desserts (no, definitely don't know the names) and a fruit custard, and then this hot milk soup thing. One of the rice puddings had a WEIRD aftertaste! Not necessarily bad, nor unpleasant, but I wouldn't get it again. The hot milk soup dessert was the winner for me. I asked what it was called and she said something like \"picee\" which, of course, I've spelled wrong and would have no idea how to Google it. Damn delicious is what it is.  Bottom line: go in for lunch!   I'm going to bring the man in here to try it out. Hell I'm bringing everyone in here."}
{"text":"A GREAT taste of India (although I admit I am not Indian). What I do know is that this place is pretty. damn. authentic. compared to the shitty Americanized curries among other white-washed 'indian' restaurants. So if you enjoy exploring new varieties of exotic food with a HUGE selection (I'm talking about over 15 different food options), then yeah, give it a try.   I fkin loved it. And for the price? It has value."}
{"text":"Came by for the $9.99 lunch buffet since some of my friends really wanted to try it! 4/5 stars since it's pretty good and I'd have no reservation in going back but it seemed very comparable to the other Indian buffets I've had in Tempe. The chicken makhani was well spiced and very tender and I also enjoyed the goat biryani. They have plenty of both meat and vegetarian options such as the saag paneer and they had a dish called chili chest nut that tastes very similar to orange chicken! Fresh naan and dosa is brought to your table as well. They have a few dessert options (rice kheer) as well as cantaloupe and a limited salad bar as well. I tried a couple of the rice kheer desserts and one had a mango flavor which I loved and one that was more of a coconut flavor that I didn't like as much. There's definitely a large variety of dishes here for 9.99!"}
{"text":"Chennai   Fusion Grill   What a find here!   For starters, we ordered Vegetable Samosas (4.99) and Papadams 2Pcs (1.00). The samosa pastry was not over cooked however a bit under seasoned. The Papadams were.extra light, lovely, crispy & fresh * TIP : ask for red onion!   We tried some soup too, Rasam (1.99) spicy broth with tomato & spices. It was amazing!!  Omi, our server, recommended Chennai Special Chicken Vartha Curry (11.99) and it was absolutely amazing. Pair it with an order of plain naan (1.99) which is fluffy & light  We can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. It was my first visit and I will make it a point to return. The service was outstanding. The buffet offered at lunch had a huge variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Terrible buffet. Not even one item was up to the mark. Paneer was very hard, chicken biryani rice is uncooked, dosa was just ok, mango custard was sour, Shashi tukada was very oily. Such a disappointment. I would not recommend the buffet at all."}
{"text":"The best authentic Indian Food in town :) all the people there are nice and willing to recommend or offer you treats and teas. Mango lassi is amazingly freshly made. No disappointment worth the drive from Phoenix."}
{"text":"Worst customer service and super-long waiting time!!!!! I called for a takeout order at 9.30 pm and the waiter on phone informed me that the restaurant closes at 10 pm and I can still place my order since they take their last order until 9.35 pm. I quickly ordered a chicken fried rice and the waiter on phone rushed me through the phone call saying he needs to hang up to take other phone orders. Fair enough until then! When my husband went for the order pickup around 9.45 pm, they made him wait till 10.25 pm (the restaurant closes at 10 pm)just for our chicken fried rice. The owner apologised but the same waiter who took my phone order had the nerve to blame me for calling late as we were their last order. Btw, which part of the world does it take 40 minutes to cook a freaking fried rice!!!....extremely upset...never going back again!!!"}
{"text":"The lamb biryani was really good. The biryani quantity was really impressive. Filled my big tummy. Went here for dinner and was not disappointed. Mango lassi was ok."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place for true North Indian cuisine. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an authentic taste. The service is great as well, they extremely friendly and are always asking if they can do more to help. The atmosphere is modern and very clean  We dined in, but the take out seemed to be very popular and timely  Enjoy"}
{"text":"It took (so) long to bring the food (I was literally waiting for 15 minutes while my friends were eating ). The food was delicious but kind of pricey!"}
{"text":"Just now. I'm 50% of the customers here. It's deserted. Ordered a Bombay and tonic and a Chicken Vindaloo. No tonic Sir, how about soda? No thanks, let's just do the chicken. 45 minutes later, I bailed.  What in the name of God could take this long for food?"}
{"text":"Not even worth one star. Literally had to throw the food. It was that bad. I can't understand how people give great reviews for such kind of food. Not going back ever."}
{"text":"I just went here Sunday and the buffet was fabulous. Today I went for dinner with the hope of getting the same great food. I ordered the Paneer Pakora and it was tasty. I then ordered the Goat Masala and Aloo Parotha. The other waiter said get garlic naan, I was like Ive been eating this almost all my life I like aloo parotha. You wouldnt think someone who doesnt eat Indian regularly would choose goat right? The Goat was just ok, it was in their words Mild, which is medium to hot spicy. I love spicy so I dont midn but imagine first time indian food eaters. In addition I asked the waiter if there are any dairy free vegan options since I wanted to bring food for my sister. Waiters were very non helpful. They did not check on me once until they brought me the bill. They didnt do the same for the other 3 tables in there. In addition the waiter thought I had ordered another goat which I clearly didnt and when I went to pay upfront (I was tired of waitng for the waiters) the goat I didnt order was still on my bill. I ordered some baked items at the end wanting to order the Golub Jamun but I saw mold all over it. Im not here ot try to put a place out of business but the service tonight was some of the worst I have ever had. I felt very unwelcome the whole time. The food is inconsistent and service was awful but since there is a large Indian following they will do well. No thanks for next time, this was one oft he biggest gut checks Ive ever had when it comes to food. I was looking forward to dinner tonight."}
{"text":"I went for buffet and though the spread was good, the taste was average. Some of the chat items that needed to served hot were cold and the biryani tasted bitter. The deserts and appetizers tasted fine. The service was good it too. So overall it was an average experience."}
{"text":"This is going to be my favorite place for rest of life.I had ordered for chicken biryani, kothuparota chicken and Gobi Manchurian, all are mouthwatering .thanks to chefs and special thanks to owners of the restaurant for giving warm welcome ."}
{"text":"The entrees were good, husband's and mine.  The bread was not.  The service was horrendous.  The waiter served us in blue jeans and a tea shirt - I mean - really!  He pretended to understand when I ordered Naan \"light\" with no brown on it.  I specifically told him if it was dark with any blackened parts on it or much brown, I would not eat it so it had to be lightly cooked.  He brought it with the bottom completely dark brown, the top part at least 1/2 brown & 1/2 lighter and parts all over were black.  I told him it was specifically what I did not want.  Again, he pretended to understand.  The cook came out and asked what was wrong with it.  Obviously, the two do not communicate with each other.  I could not find vegetable dishes on the menu and told the waiter so and I asked him if vegetables came with the main course - the entrees because I could not find vegetable dishes on the menu.  He said no \"there are no separate vegetable dishes\".  So, I ordered just the main dish and the naan, which I sent back and he returned it and left it for my husband.  After a wait and when the food almost arrived, I turned around the alcoholic menu and found - vegetable dishes, in the form of appetizers.  The waiter completely missed the mark.  I wished I had ordered one of those.  It was too late because no sooner had I seen those for about one minute at most, the food had arrived.  So, I ate curried lamb.  It was tasty, perfectly good but, there were no vegetables and thanks to a moron of a waiter, I was told there were none to order separately and there were zero with the curried lamb dish, just pieces of lamb in a curried sauce.  I do not eat white rice and that has zero nutrition anyway so even if I ate that, which I did not, it would have contributed nothing to a meal of some value to the body.  If the waiter did a decent job, we would have ordered a couple of vegetable appetizers and been a lot happier about the meal and there was no excuse for bringing me brown & blacked naan when he knew I had ordered it light with little or no brown on it - cooked very lightly.  It was around 7 p.m. and there was only one other couple in the entire restaurant.  While we were eating, one other couple came in to eat.  Perhaps, the nearly empty place and the t-shirt and blue jeans says something about the food and management.  It was a huge disappointment overall because I did like my lamb dish and my husband liked his.  He remarked on our way home that his lamb dish was better than the food at the last two Indian restaurants we had been to.  In fact, the very last one about a month before that was not good at all so, it is too bad that this restaurant hired a clueless dumb bunny for a waiter who was no help at all - messed up on the vegetables and messed up on the bread.  My impression is that husband wants to give them one more chance.  I am thinking to go to the place we have been several times that is very good - quite a drive though.  If ever a waiter did not deserve a tip, this one was it but husband tips everybody regardless.  I suggested something less than adequate."}
{"text":"As delicious as the food is, we were seated by the door and a cold breeze blew over us every time the door opened, our food took a long time to come, and the staff was a bit inattentive."}
{"text":"Buffett style is great with vegetarian options. I'd like to try the dinner menu. The place is kinda dirty, rice was all over our table and our server cleaned it off onto the floor. And left it there. Nice people, food is amazing. I got an unsuspecting red chilli pepper that ruined my taste buds, but alas. I will come back here if to see the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We did catering order for our son birthday. Reasonable rates and great taste. Hairyali kofta is our favorite. Good customer service and staff is very helpful"}
{"text":"I'm not a big buffet person but when comes to Indian food, I like them as it gives me an opportunity to taste and try different foods. They had a wide variety of foods to accommodate our lunch group including the vegetarians and its priced reasonable. & the customer service was good. Would definitely come back during dinner service"}
{"text":"This place had decent number of varieties of veg and non veg dishes. Masala Dosa will also be served  and it was too good. They have lot of dessert today and they're mysore pak was at its best. I would recommend this place anytime."}
{"text":"So came back many years hearing from my colleague it is now good. But there are things that cannot be changed no matter what you do.  One of those things is the south Indian food served here like dosa, Vada, sambar and chutney. As stated in my earlier review this restaurant does not deserve to have a south Indian name. I feel it is a way just to bring customers in.  This time we ordered dosa, sambar Vada and oothapam. Dosa was tasteless because it was lacking salt. My biggest concern was chutney. Chutney was served cold and my guess they just took it from their buffet. FYI making fresh coconut chutney takes less than 5 mins. We had asked onions to be sprinkled on sambar Vada. Any south Indian restaurant will know what that means. But they gave us few slices of onions placed on top of Vada :) so we asked for a knife so we could chop those onions ourselves. Sambar was ok but I am pretty sure it was from the buffet as well. The oothapam was so thick and it was like a pancake. FYI pancake and oothapam are completely different items so please do not try to make it American friendly. I am pretty sure Americans prefer authenticity than similarity. So if you are going for dinner, order something which is not from the buffet menu so you will get it fresh. Also do not order any south Indian items. It is not worth your money."}
{"text":"Meh. It's decent Indian and has a decent selection but the high quality isn't there and they really skimp on the meats on their buffet.  Not to mention the Tandoori is really dry and seems like they cook it days before and microwave it or something. Kinda has a very weird sandy texture.  I'd skip it. Better Indian food around and $12.99 is a lot for a buffet of this quality."}
{"text":"Main Points: -Variety of cuisine, both North and South Indian food -Accomodates groups -Good for catering   Review: I was lucky enough to be a part of the preview day before the grand opening, and I was not disappointed!  I'd like to point out that I have no relationship or previous bias to the owners/restaurant, rather I was invited to taste the cuisine because of an upcoming event that we'll need catered. I tasted at least 20 different food items this restaurant had to offer and everything was very good or better.    The owners, as well as the head chef, are extremely friendly and accommodating, and if you have an event to cater for, they are easy to work with.  My favorites of the night were the chicken tikka and the tandoori chicken...I've had these dishes at several Indian restaurants and I'd say this restaurant made them the best of AZ Indian restaurants (hence the 5 stars).  The head chef was previously at Karaikudi Palace in Scottsdale, so if you were a fan of that you'll likely enjoy this food.  Check out the lunch buffet to try a variety of dishes."}
{"text":"Close to Intel and had a lunch date - Buffet is the only option and you can't order from the menu. The staff was pretty friendly and tons of options.  Pros: eggplant dish briyani rice was great and lots of it! dosa comes with naan as well multiple levels of spice - it wasn't just all spicy pitcher of water at the table  Cons: Could not order off the menu - craving Gobi manchurian that day!  after drinking our entire pitcher, slow to refill that waters after that"}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants with authentic Indian cuisine in the valley. I ordered dosa and a biriyani. Unlike any other restaurants they give quantity worth your money and a quality service. And yes for all veggies out there, you MUST try the biriyani here. Another friend ordered a bhatura... It was soo good and huge.. we had a great evening!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place...the first time I was there.  The second time, the experience was the totally opposite.    After finding out there is a new Indian buffet by work, I gathered a couple of colleagues and headed to Chennai.  We were greeted immediately, seated with a full pitcher of ice water, and gotten our bread order in.  We received our hot/fresh dosa and naan very quickly after sitting down.  The food had great flavor and more variety than most other buffet.  The servers checked on us and took our plates away.  Great first visit!  I was very excited and wanted to take my wife there as soon as possible.  The second visit, my wife and I walked in after a group of three people and in front of a group of two.  The hostess totally ignored us and proceeds to talk to the group in front and behind us.  I tried a couple of times to get her attention but it was impossible without making a scene.  We decided to let her know when she comes back.  The people in front of us got a table within a minute.  After another five minutes, a table was being cleaned.  The group behind us received that table.  I followed them and informed them that we were ahead.  The group was nice enough to get up and let us have the table.  The hostess and a server saw the incident and came over.  I explained to the hostess that I was right in front of her waving my hand and she totally ignored us...she laughed and apologized.  The server smiled an apology too and offered to bring us some mango lassi.  We headed towards the buffet.  On the table, we had two filled glasses of warm water, empty pitcher, no lassi, and a plate of dosa (one plain and one masala).  My wife and I both wanted a masala one.  We decided to share the one and continue with our meal.  After our first plate, our naan still have not arrived.  I tracked the hostess down and a few minutes later, a basket of almost cold naan showed up.  We continued our meal.  A couple of times, a server would pick up our plate but never offered to get more naan or refill our pitcher.  Both our water glasses were almost empty.  One of the workers dropped a glass on the ground but didn't clean up all of it.  There were several large pieces visible when walking by.  The tables around us seem to receive water and fresh one without asking.  At one point, the hostess actually told a customer that she will bring out fresh naan because the ones she had were not hot.  After our meal, I asked the server if we should go up or wait for the bill.  She said she will bring it to us because things have slowed down.  After a few minutes, we noticed that she was ringing people up.  We decided to get up to pay and leave.  A few other observations I wanted to share.  The owner should really put up a sign asking patrons to use a new plate each time they go back for more food.  I saw several people put serving utensils directly on their used plates.  When they refilled utensils, there were still food and water on them.  It looked like they just came out of the dish washer...but thought they would warm from the hot water used to wash them.  Maybe they have a new way of sanitizing them without using hot water.  The floor was very sticky both times I was there.  I really did enjoy the food but would not go back.  I felt like we were discriminated against because we were not from India.  If I do go back, I will bring my Indian friend from the first visit.  That seems to work out better."}
{"text":"WOOOOOOOOOOASHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA  WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWW!  I love this place! Best indian Food in Duhhhhrizona. Ive been to many indian restaurants, this one has the biggest best cleanest selection and sometimes even a desert buffet? Seriously this is the best ...   Only suggestion is get those dosas out faster my friends! gonna need to for all the chutneys and curries and tasty goodness ...... Oh thank you or this magnificent food place."}
{"text":"Chennai Fusion Grill always has delicious food and a great ambiance. I love their wide range of buffet options, featuring different items everyday. When I went, they had delicious Indo-Chinese options in the buffet, in addition to many classic and unique Indian dishes. I also tried their Mango Mastani drink, it was so refreshing! The perfect blend of mango flavor, with a slight twist. Definitely worth trying! Love this place!"}
{"text":"We have been to many Indian restaurants in the valley and this is by far one of the best! Great service and very good food. We have been here for both the lunch buffet and dinner, the buffet was filled with fresh food and good choices. We will definitely be return costumers!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place!!! I had a horrible day on Monday because I was craving this place and they're closed on Mondays and today being Independence Day, I feared they'd be closed today too....and I would die...i would simply die if I wasn't able to have this place for two days straight.   Anywho, I usually order this via UberEATS and pay a hefty $5.99 delivery fee...but it's worth it, plus I get 15% off being an Uber driver...so it all works out. Normally I order the Idli and the Dosa with potato masala. Idli are steamed rice and lentil cakes served with sambar, which is a thick lentil soup...and it also comes with a coconut chutney. They're delicious! Dosa is a very very thin rice crepe...rip off a piece of that bad boy, grab some of the potato masala and dip it in either sambar or one of the two chutney's they give you and it's a BURST of flavor.   Today I ordered sambar vada, which is two fried lentil donuts (they gave me three) soaked in sambar (the lentil soup) and garnished with cilantro. I also ordered the Dosa again because I can't live without it. Both items were delicious and super flavorful.   The UberEATS delivery driver stated that she does a lot of pickups from this restaurant and I can see why...everything is packaged super well....wrapped in saran wrap and in durable containers. Oh, and people order this because it's awesome food!"}
{"text":"I went there twice. The first time - The food was fresh and good variety. The second time - I don't think the food was fresh and both my husband and I had an upset stomach. Not sure if I would try it again."}
{"text":"Incredible food and amazing service. This is my favorite place for lunch when I'm in Chandler. The butter chicken is awesome. If you are looking for a great quality food and great taste, Chennai Fusion Grill offers a wide variety of tastes, spices, and is not all spicy if you have someone who is sensitive to spicy food. I like the vegetarian selection, which affords options for those individuals who do not care to consume meat. I would suggest having lunch before noon since this place is very popular."}
{"text":"Great buffet with great service and a good spread, The only thing I was not a fan of was the buffet price since a family of five can add up to a large ticket. Buffets on the East Coast were much cheaper so I am still trying to get used to the two digit buffet prices in Arizona."}
