{"text":"So many different varities. They rarely repeat the same pizza so you get to try tons. Pizza is super thin so you get to try alot. Amazing authentic Italian crust. Top customer service who are extremely welcoming. You could either choose all you can eat for $8 or you could take out any 12 slices for the same price. You could also order pizza with any toppings for same price for take out. Don't like any pizza in the buffet? They will make whatever you want specially for you! What else would you ask for? They have a plan to open 15 stores around gta. This is thier test location. I highly recommend and worth the trip. Decoration is average, but who cares?"}
{"text":"So this is an all you can eat pizza buffet with some basic pasta options, a basic salad bar and a \"mashed potato\" bar where they serve mashed potatoes in martini glasses??  Pizza is bad. It's like bad homemade pizza.  The female server was beyond excellent. Super friendly and helpful. She should really be working somewhere like The Keg where I'm sure she'd make more money. Given the food, she is the only reason I can guess that this place is still in business."}
{"text":"I just went there with my family tonight, it was $7.99 per person, drinks not included. It was surprisingly good, a variety of about 10 different interesting pizzas covering the spectrum of meat/vegetarian/pepperoni/dessert. Also includes pasta, soup and salad, which were of limited selection but good as well. They brought around fresh pizzas and offered you a piece or two before placing them on the buffet line. The chef seemed to care a lot about his pizza and take pride in what he does. Atmosphere is the biggest weakness, it's basically like a large take-out pizza place, where the buffet replaces the counter and more seating... i.e. basic chairs, tables and fluorescent lights. All in all though it's worth a try and maybe if it gets enough support they'll put more money in the atmosphere. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"A great little place. Good food at cheap prices. Check it out!"}
