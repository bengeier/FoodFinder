{"text":"Our family hits up Calypso Hut when visiting our cousins in Brampton. We have always ordered takeout and this was our (and the cousin too) time to actually eat at the CH. Coming from Nebraska we don't have many options for West Indian food unless we cook it at home. I just wanted some veggie fried rice. This is nothing like what you get in Nebraska. Our table ordered banga. Was gone in a flash. We had veggie fried rice, veggie chow mein, veggie lo mein and chicken in the ruff with chow mein. Food tastes pretty close to what the aunties make when we visit. We were bummed that they were out of curry potato and roti. But that's what you have to expect when you go for lunch at 3 pm.  After multiple take out meals it was nice to finally get the hot fresh meal straight from the kitchen. Oh and the waitress was personable and cracked me up when she called my cousin bougie for ordering a glass for his Moosehead.  If you are visiting the GTA, take time to head to Brampton and check out the Hut."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious! Everything was made fresh!!! Pepper shrimp is to die for!!!! Special chicken fried rice was packed with flavour!  Had a conference in the area, my friends and I went there for the for lunch and had to go back the next day because it was soooooo good!  Pepper sauce is so flavourful not just hot! I think the place focuses on dinner and catering for food and it turns into a nightclub on the weekends."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon.  Only 2 other patrons were in the restaurant.  We ordered a beef fried rice, special mixed lo mein and an order of chicken wings.  Beef fried rice: This dish was okay, nothing special.  Flavour was good, but I've had better.  Special mixed lo-mein:  Awful.  It was too saucy and extremely salty.  It was supposed to have chicken, beef, shrimp and mixed vegetables.  We got a pound of noodles, a couple of pieces of chicken, beef and shrimp with two pieces of broccoli.  Very disappointing.  Chicken wings:  I must admit, this was the best dish we ordered.  The wings were hot and tasty.  Perfectly cooked.  Would definitely order these again.  Overall, not worth the drive from Toronto."}
