{"text":"Went for lunch. The cashew nut chicken was delicious. The price was also good, at ~$10 including tax. Sometimes the cutlery and drinking glasses are slightly unclean, but this was easily resolved before the feeding commenced."}
{"text":"Have to agree with Caroline B's review below.  My family used to really enjoy Go For Thai, however food quality has dropped drastically and we choose other Whitby thai restaurants now.   My last takeout order included the peanut chicken curry that had rancid peanuts in it - when i called to tell them they told me that I was mistaken and that the peanuts may have scorched in the wok.... Yeah right.  Pad Thai that was once some of the best in the city is a shadow of its former self with mostly just rice noodles and very little else.  Too bad, I used to really like this place.  Will be waiting for a few more positive reviews before I visit again."}
{"text":"We took out a basic meal from this restaurant only to discover a partly opened staple (yes from a desk stapler) in the pad Thai.   Fortunately there was no injury however the staple was  opened and was essentially equivalent of finding a fish hook in our food. After speaking with the restaurant we were informed the owner manager is only in on Tuesday. We requested to speak with the manager and waited but received no follow-up call. We were initially offered a free entree. However we felt important the manager understood the significance of this problem and made changes to avoid something like this happening in the future.   However because the manager did not follow up we're leaving this review so I can inform any new user of this restaurant that something similar might happen to them and to be careful. A staple is made of metal and easily lodged in the esophagus.  In this case I cannot understand how staple. managed to find its way into it closed container of pad Thai suffice to say if I was the manager   I would be alarmed and following up immediately.   Owner manager needs to address customer complaints and take measures to avoid contaminating food. This case it resulted in a negative review however they're lucky it could have been a lawsuit."}
{"text":"This is my local place for thai and hakka food.  It doesn't seem as busy as it once was, and that is too bad. The food quality is just as good as the day it opened its doors. My favorites are: Yellow Thai curry (beef or chicken), Malay Chicken, spicy crispy beef, and Singapore noodles. If you prefer the basics: Spring Rolls, and Sweet and Sour chicken are the way to go. They also have great lunchtime deals. Give it a try."}
{"text":"We chose this place when our usual was closed. The food was sub-par and not very appealing. Having paid for it we powered on. Later in the night two of our party began to have stomach issues (one a toddler). We won't be ordering from here ever again. Do yourself a favour and steer clear."}
{"text":"Great Hakka type food. Haven't tried their Thai stuff as of yet. The Singapore noodles and chicken pakora is to die for!"}
{"text":"I've only started eating at Go For Thai since last summer so I can't compare the quality of the food to the previous chef like these other reviews. If I don't pack a lunch for work, about 90% of the time I'll get a lunch special to go from here. For about $8 they give me a portion of deliciously tasty Hakka noodles or spicy beef on rice to last me two meals. And they throw in a decent spring roll. About two months ago they reduced the size of the spring roll to a cigarette! But the size of the spring roll won't stop me from ordering here. It's much more worth it than getting a stinky Subway or stale Tim's chili for lunch."}
{"text":"Originally I was going to give this place a full rating but since their former chef left the quality dropped massively! It is such a shame, the food was so tasty and flavorful now its like any other Thai restaurant on the block.  My favourites has to be the Manchurian Fried Rice and the Spicy Crispy Beef. You get good portions and they do not skimp on the meat. A lot of places tend to give crappy portions of meat and seafood but here is an exception.   The dining area is rather small but it's very clean and the decor is simple and modern. Very relaxing. Staff are super friendly as well. I'd suggest getting here at a good time before all the seats get taken but there is takeout if you are starving."}
{"text":"Want great Thai food on a budget? Keep reading.    Go For Thai is a great spot for lunch or dinner. Prices are fantastic and the portions are healthy. When you enter, you are greeted by the very friendly staff. The d√©cor is simple and sleek, nothing tacky in here. The booths are so cozy, but there are only a few!    The menu offers a lot of choice. Soups and salads all the way to veggie and satays; you have a lot to choose from. We started with the Go For Thai's House Platter. It had everything. It came with calamari, spicy satay skewers, golden baskets and spring rolls. It's a big ol' plate of flavours; spicy and savoury. Yum! A great choice if no one can decide on an app.   Now for the main courses. We chose Sweet & Sour Fish, Pad Thai, Cantonese Chow Mein and steamed rice on the side. The fish had a light batter and a light taste; my boyfriend would even eat it and he is not a seafood guy. The chow mein wasn't what I expected. I expected it to be like the Chinese variety. This had a fantastic Thai twist. They definitely didn't try to duplicate the Chinese version, they made it theirs and they made it good. The Pad Thai was also not your everyday Pad Thai, sweet and citrus made this dish stand on it's own.  The server might have been the owner. He thanked us for coming, gave us take out menus and told us about the daily specials for eat in and takeout. He was very gracious and said he hoped we'd come back.   I've been here a few times for dinner and lunch. They are so consistent, it's crazy. Sometimes the service can be a little slow, but you soon forget once the food arrives. Fresh and fantastic!  The lunch specials are under $10 and you don't leave hungry. Great deals!   Highly recommended for Thai in Whitby!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after hearing praise from my friend, I was let down and confused a little as to why my friend loved it so much. I realized quality can change, and I'm assuming it has, seems like a lot of reviews here agree that it started out decent and got gradually worse, I say avoid this place. There business will suffer unless they improve. I had a chicken breast (I think it was honey something) it was tender but tasted off, like it was old. I guess the mold helped tenderize the meat :), suffice to say I only took one bite."}
{"text":"Am suspicious of the 5-star reviews as this place is incredibly underwhelming if you are a fan of Thai food.   We ordered the fried spring rolls and asked the server what other dishes he'd recommend. He selected cold spring rolls and Cashew Nut Chicken. I told him we couldn't have nuts, so he said he'd make it without the cashews. Kind of him.   We were one of 2 tables. That said, service was quite prompt. We received our appetizers and main dish at the same time.   The fried spring rolls were fine. Served steaming hot, but the taste was very bland. They did not come with sauce so that was a bit of a miss.   The cold spring rolls were tolerable but not a recommended option. Soft rice noodles, dry dark meat chicken slice, cucumber slice, stick of red pepper and a hunk of hard-boiled egg (with grey overcooked yolk). These had sauce.   Cashew Nut Chicken (even without cashews) was the best dish. Great, flavorful sauce, green and red peppers and tender onions cooked just right (without that raw bite).  Not overly special but one of their better dishes, certainly.  All in all it was OK, but I don't think we'd be back."}
{"text":"This review was based on one visit, dine-in. The seating area looked clean and tidy, but there was a cold draft by the window area. We were greeted at the door and were handed the menu. The menu itself was a telltale for me as I thought it was very large and diverse - such large menus with very diverse dishes indicate one thing for me: the restaurant is not specialized, in other words, jack of all trade...  We ordered the spring rolls, lemon shrimp soup, shrimp wonton soup, padtai and Thai spicy checken noodles.  The food presentation was good, however, I was only able to pick and eat the shrimp off the lemon shrimp soup, left the horrible soup and the raw mushrooms, floating in it. The shrimp wonton soup was ok, the wife shared some of her's. The pad Thai and the Thai spicy chicken noodle were edible, just because we were hungry.  The server never asked if we wanted drinks and had to be called to the table for that. The bathroom was modern and clean.  We regreted going there, especially knowing that there was a good Thai restaurant that was only a quick 3 minute drive away."}
{"text":"Meh. Was OK I guess. The thai style soup was good. The shrimp and chicken thai rice I had had two shrimp in it, yes only two and the chicken was little crumbles. Mostly carrots and rice. Had an OK flavor. Sort of dry. Would not make a point to go here again."}
