{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in Montreal!

Their uni bone marrow mazesoba was unique and delicious. The combination of uni and bone marrow with ramen noodle was perfect; they melted in my mouth. Their kaisendon was so fresh as well! 

Not only their food is good, I love their interior design and atmosphere. 

Definitely coming back again to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! My friend and I were looking for a place to eat dinner and saw someone eating the steak as we walked by. It looked so good, my friend insisted we try the place out. It was not a disappointment. The server was friendly and patient. We got the steak and noodle entrees. The dishes were a decent portion and just satisfied us. For the price of the dishes, they could have given a little more. But it was delish! Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to check out here Since I love( I go there at least once a week)
The venue is cozy and small but no sign it was hard to find it tho
Unlike Yakitori place,They don't have charcoal grilled skewers 
but we try sashimi plates and Hamburg steak which was really amazing!
Lovely place with friends and family."}
{"text":"Went there for supper with a friend, and the food was quite good. However, one of the waiters, who also seemed to be manager, was openly very rude with one waitress. He seemed drunk,kept yelling at her, swearing, and it all became awkward very quickly for the clients."}
