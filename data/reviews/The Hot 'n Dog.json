{"text":"I happened upon this place with two friends yesterday afternoon, lured by the sell of \"gourmet hot dogs\" on the cheap.  To be clear, I would not label the hot dog offerings as \"gourmet\". The bun and dog are your standard grocery store fare. But with 55 toppings, you've the ability to create your own works of wonder.  The real catch to me was the sheer variety of the toppings. Jerk sauce to cinnamon toast crunch to zucchini relish. And unlike most establishments with wide variety of add-ons, there was no extra cost for any of these. Put as many on as you want, and not pay an extra penny.  The most challenging thing about Hot N Dog is determining, of their massive condiment menu, what to combine to create the perfect dog. Unsure about toppings such as peanut butter or cereal, I stayed with semi-standard fare, adding red curry and sauerkraut.   So, for $6 (added a drink), I found myself with some fairly unique dogs. They filled me, partially due to loading on about 6 toppings per dog, and I was satisfied. It's fairly rare in this city to achieve a varied and filling meal and drink for under $6.  One thing to note, there are no soft drinks here. Some basic juices and water, that's all.  I'd definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Not the best hot dogs, but the owner is an absolutely incredible guy. Super nice, and one of those people you can't help but love.   The best part is the ridiculous number of toppings. Ask him to surprise you, I got a soy-bacon veggie dog with maple syrup and a friend got a nutella with pretzel pieces. It was awesome!"}
{"text":"I was one of the first people who's first eaten at The Hot N' Dog. When it came out, I wanted to go try out hot dogs since I was tired of eating Poutine and Fries everyday at lunch.   First thing that struck me was that the restaurant's really REALLY small, no bigger than an average washroom. The service was amazing. The owner, George, is really nice, sweet, and called everyone 'Sweetie, Darling, Cutie,' etc. Not to help it that he's attractive too.  The food is really cheap and had over 50+ toppings. You can order anything for a price of $5.00 flat which included a bag of chips, drink, and of course, your custom made hot dog. There's a hot dog called the \"The Hong Kong\" that allows you to put ALL 50+ toppings ON your hot dog. Beware; it's messy.   George really holds contest on his FB page about who can get a hot dog named after them. Pretty cool right? Now, summer 2012 came and the service went down. George hired some highschoolers across from my old elementary school, and he left to man the other restaurants he owns in his region (he's not from Toronto). The service went downhill because the new workers give you a vibe that's basically telling you to get out.   Back to today. Now, the Hot N' Dog has over about 75+ you can choose of, has Ice Cream, Cotton Candy (legit cotton candy), Freezies, comic books, candy, fries, hot dog, and a whole bunch of new things. I don't go there any longer since I have no reason to, but definitely worth checking out if you can tolerate the horrible service and lack of space."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood!  Tons of amazing toppings, essentially unlimited combinations, super friendly owner, nice juicy hot dogs.  If you're looking for a good \"gourmet hot dog\" (if that's not an oxymoron) then look no further.  The space is tiny, but there is space for 3 or 4 people to sit, so if it's too cold to eat your dog outside, you can still pull up a seat and chat with George.  I hear that come spring they'll even serve ice cream!"}
{"text":"Spoiler alert- the chili dog consists of bacon bits and salsa.. and its effing gross"}
