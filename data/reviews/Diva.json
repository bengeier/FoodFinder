{"text":"Amazing food! I went there with my husband and 8 year old son. we were in the area and hungry around 9 am, it was breakfast time but they offered to us lunch menu as well, I got the chicken pesto sandwich with salad which was the best of the best and great size, my husband got eggs wit fruit, beacon, sausage, fries and bread... he loved it too. My son got pancakes with really fresh fruit, chocolate milk, we all looooved it!  Quality and healthy options full of flavor, friendly service and very clean!!! We'll definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and good quality. I loved their smoothies and sandwiches. It was a little wait but i appreciate it because of freshness.

They suggested to call in to skip the line and it worked... I am glad to find wonderful place to actually eat HEALTHY FOOD. thanks DIVA"}
{"text":"Simple breakfast turned into a 30 minute wait just for coffee but had hopes for a good meal . Wrong... breakfast wrap  was sloppy and tasted mushy. Coffee is horrid ! There's also this chemical smell in the place that's nauseous to me."}
{"text":"This place did not live up to the hype. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't give it the ratings it's been getting. Maybe it was what I got but I wasn't crazy about the salmon. Very small portion for the price. Vegetables seemed of the frozen pack variety. Fries were great. But I also ordered a smoothie which they forgot and I had to remind them. Smoothie was very good though. Next time I'll try a wrap or a burger or something probably a lot better."}
{"text":"Just finished having breakfast here... What a great little joint! Food was fresh and no fuss service. They were happy/easy to ol work with to accommodate my partner's dietary restriction. Thanks for a lovely breakfast - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff was extremely pleasant, and the food was incontrovertibly fantastic. Prices were reasonable and portions were generous. Fantastic for brunch. 

I had the vegetarian omelette with goat cheese and it was great. 

I would recommend this spot to family and friends and would be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Weird concept of health food and a grill. Great for lunch items that you could typically cook at home (not a bad thing). I had the burger ( they were sold out of turkey burger, pork ribs) and the beef burger was pretty generic but the avocado sauce was pretty great with it. Fries were perfectly done double blanched in fresh oil (sunflower oil perhaps). A touch pricey but not a deal breaker eat your lunch for 15$. You would expect more fish items for a health restaurant all they had was seared salmon. I'd come back for the sole reason of trying the salad bar out which looks cool alot of options"}
{"text":"The food was good. Fresh and quick.  But in my opinion over priced for what ordered. This would be a 3-4 star review except for the following. 

The server spent nearly the whole lunch hour arguing with the kitchen staff very loudly and unprofessionaly then coming out to the 'dining room' and apologizing because good help was hard to find.  

Then when the bill came she announced the price didn't include tip. When I walked to the counter  she reiterated the price did not include a tip. She then wanted to add my tip to my bill before using debit because the machine was not programmed to add a tip. It was a very odd transaction

  I left a cash tip as to not risk being taxed additionally on my tip which I hope.made it into the kitchen staffs pot"}
{"text":"Love this place! I really wish it was opened later during the week so that I could grab dinner here! So fresh. Large Portions. Really nice people who own it. So tastey and healthy! Will be going back many more times!!"}
{"text":"Did not live up to its high reviews.

This is not a place with sit down service. You order and pay, then wait for your food to come out and walk up to the counter to pick it up and bring back to your table. 

Food was underwhelming. Got the \"make it everything\" which came with 3 XL eggs, 1 pancake, 2 sausage, home fries, toast and fruit. Sausage was really old and chewy, as you can see in the pics. A table that came in later got fresh sausages which looked completely different from mine (golden and juicy - not shrivelled and dry). Got the eggs scrambled which tasted ok. Not very fluffy or creamy - on the dry and greasy side. Home fries were soggy and not crispy at all. Fruit was fine. Pancake was OK. It was quite chewy and not fluffy or soft. Also for some reason we had to use packaged pancake syrup while tables served after us got jugs of pourable syrup. Was odd.

Coffee cup was only filled just under 3/4 way. When asked the lady working to top it off, she asked if I had my coffee black... Is that the only circumstance in which you are permitted to have a properly filled cup of coffee? Turns out they had run out of coffee and I just got the last bit of the pot. They did end up brewing a new pot and filling my cup properly though. 

Would not return and do not understand the 5 star reviews. This place is definitely overrated when it comes to breakfast."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing omelet made with fresh ingredients served by a nice host and the place is very clean. An all round great experience. It's too bad that I'm not often in the area. Well done!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff and good and healthy food. I get my lunch from there every other day. Good divalicious salad awesome grilled chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is a real hidden gem! 

I came here for lunch the other day and it's nearby my office and was really happy to have been introduced to this spot. 

Similar to a Panera, you order your meal and pay at the front and then your food is brought out to you, but there are a lot more choices of food to choose from. At first glance the choices are your usual lunch staples; sandwiches, salads, soups but they also have a nice variety of pastas and other entrees like ribs and fish and chips. They also have a large breakfast menu. There seems to be something for everyone with a focus on freshness and healthy choices. 

I tried the warm Mediterranean salad and my friend had the chicken pesto pasta. The portion sizes were more than generous, I was full for hours after the salad and my friend took home some leftovers of her pasta. They also have a salad bar for a make-your-own salad with tons of ingredients ranging from the usual greens to more interesting ingredients like beans and chocolate chips. 

The prices are really reasonable with everything being under $15, even the ribs and seafood entrees are under $15. For the area it's really good, I end up spending close to $20 every time I go to Panera so this is a better choice economically, the freshness and quality of the food is definitely also comparable, while the variety surpasses it in my opinion. 

The service was really good, again, it's similar to a Panera so don't expect full table service but the server/cashier was really sweet and enthusiastic. The table next to us had an issue with their food and they dealt with it really well, the chef even came out to talk with the difficult customer. 

Overall an above average place for lunch in the area. The food is fresh and the service is good. I'm looking forward to trying some other menu items!"}
{"text":"So I've been back twice since the first visit and I'm still happy! The first visit I had the soup special, I was really craving some soup in the cold weather. It was a vegetable quinoa soup and it was definitely big enough to fully satisfy me. It comes with a bread roll and had some lemon slices, yum! I loved the citrus in the soup and loved the quinoa!

Second visit was Fish Friday. It looks like they have fish specials every Friday so that's what I'm calling it now haha. I try not to eat fried foods so I asked if I could get a salad with it instead, to which the staff were very accommodating. Just look at the picture, I got a hearty side salad and a big filet. The salad was nice and fresh and love that it had kalamata olives and not the yucky black ones. The onion, tomato and mango pico de gallo on top of the fish was delicious! I couldn't get enough of it. The fish was cooked well also. I was so stuffed I had to take some of the salad home.

As always the staff were friendly and welcoming. Definitely going to keep coming here when I have lunch out."}
{"text":"I rarely say this, but Diva Vaughan was phenomenal. From the moment you set foot inside, you are welcome by their enthusiastic team who are eager to share their delicious, fresh menu with you. My co-worker and I shared the veggie burger and one of their grilled chicken salads. Fresh from the market is a bit of an understatement, everything tasted as if they'd just hand picked all of the produce upon ordering. Even the veggie burger was delectable. (Vaguely reminded me of a Lick's Veggie burger except 10 times better.) I will 100% be back here."}
