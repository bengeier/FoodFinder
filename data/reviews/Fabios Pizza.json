{"text":"Fabio's is open late, priced fair and the delivery service is usually prompt; we ordered from there Saturday night at 2:30 a.m. and it took about an hour; which is about 15-20 min longer then normal.   At 3:30 a.m. I'd rate it 4 stars. At 3:30 p.m. I'd probably rate it 2. Get what I'm saying?"}
{"text":"FORCED TO TIP! Unbelievably rude and persistent at their customers. And to top it all off, I was forced to tip $2. I know, $2 is nothing, but I DROVE 20 minutes out of my way and still forced to tip. The WHOLE POINT of driving there is to not have to tip. And their pizza is horrific. Never going again.  UPDATE: he called my number and cursed me out"}
{"text":"Let's start with the food. It was Wednesday night. I ordered pizza and wings. They were a little above average and had good flavor.   Now lets talk about the process. I ordered and I felt rushed off the phone. Very broken english. I was told 25 minutes. 50 minutes later I called and was told to go to the lobby. I went down. No one. I called again and was told that he was coming in finding parking. I saw the driver and saw he had stacks of pizzas in his car.   I'll tell you what happened. The phone guy was over promising and under delivering. He probably told everyone 25 minutes even though it would take longer. Note to businesses: don't lie to your customers. Just tell me it would have taken 50 minutes. I would have kept my order in there."}
{"text":"Absolute scum trash.  Ordered up some wings and a couple pies late night.  The \"food\" got there about 2 hours later.  After I destroyed a whole pie and order of wings myself, I had to lay there and listen to my friend burp for the next 2 hours from this garbagey nonsense.    I've scummed alot of pies in my life, this goes down as the worst.  Fabio's sucks."}
{"text":"Seriously? Is this a joke? Clearly the whole menu is a copy/paste of Nunzios menu. Way to be original."}
{"text":"The employees there were completely rude, first off. It was about 40 minutes until their closing time and I called to order a pizza. I gave them my credit card number and described the pizza I wished to receive. I waited up till about 4:30 (30 minutes after they would have closed) and still had no pizza. They did not answer my calls and when I finally got ahold of them, they said that they came and there was no answer-- which is not true. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. Go someplace else."}
{"text":"First off, how many places in Cleveland can you get a large pizza for a reasonabe price at 2:00 in the morning?  Not many, to say the least!  So it is fair to say that Fabios Pizza is a good choice for delivery or pickup whether you're hungry for pizza, or just want some wings to chew on. The owners are direct from Italy and clearly know how to make a great Italian pizza. The pizza has little grease but a lot of flavor and the crust is nice and crispy.  Also,  the sauce is homemade and adds zest to the cheese, which is a provolone/mozzerella blend.  While this place may not get credit for its location or appearance, the food definitely overshadows everything else and is worth a try."}
{"text":"This was the most disgusting food I have ever ordered and not to mention they overcharged my credit card by $5. I think the meat used was bad as was the cheese and the sauce tasted like it was a month old. They took 2 hours to get to me and the bag with the wings was completely full of liquid. I am already feeling sick and am not looking forward to tomorrow. If you eat Fabios, eat at your own risk"}
{"text":"We placed a pizza order and called back to cancel because it was taking too long.  The owner got upset and stated that we cost him three customers.  We still demanded our order to be cancelled.  The pizza cost $15.  The delivery person showed up to our hotel and still delivered the pizza after we called to cancel.  On top of that, Fabio's charged my credit card $45 which was three times the amount for the pizza.  I assume I was charged because the owner stated we cost him three customers by cancelling.  This is a poor way to run a business and I'm sure sooner than later you'll be out of business with this type of skullduggery.  This is unethical business practice and should be reported to the better business bureau.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"Too loud for them to hear our order correctly & 2/3 items were wrong. They were nice about it on the phone but they'll call back (at midnight I guess but whatever).  Addendum they never called back"}
{"text":"i would never in my life order from this place again. i am currently in process of taking this place down! i ordered a medium pizza, small antipasti salad and a italian sub. first of all, it all costed $32 ?!? what?!?? for nasty greasy fake food ?!? well let me tell you why i hated it even more, i ordered this 2 days ago and after eating it i woke up with a stomach flu! my poop is coming out of my butt like water every 5 minutes and i'm still sick. wash your hand you filthy people. i'm sorry i don't mean to gross anyone out, just do eat here unless you want to catch a virus ?!??? like what?!? the service is horrible. oh and they say their specialty pizzas have \"fabios sauce\" on it, such a lie, i can totally tell it is just canned sauce. so gross. so pathetic. i want them out of business. i grew up in the restaurant business and this is by far the worst!!/ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a similar experience as Connor. They said 40 minutes, and at 1.5 hr, and after calling repeatedly and hearing multiple excuses I gave up. Do not depend on these people to get your food. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"The guy on the phone was rude and impatient. I ordered a barbecue chicken pizza, and when it arrived it was cold with no chicken. It tasted horrible. The cost of the pizza was quoted over the phone to be $21, but when it arrived the driver demanded $25. I always tip the driver and I expect to pay a delivery charge, but any delivery charge should be included in the price. I felt like I was being scammed. I called Fabio's back to see if they would help to correct the problem and the phone guy insisted that I improperly ordered my pizza. The whole experience was bad business and my pizza went into the trash. What a waste. I will drive to Lakewood to get my pizzas at Angelo's from now on."}
{"text":"Being from Western New York, I'm always skeptical about ordering Buffalo wings anywhere else but home... yet I give them a try anyways because I appreciate regional twists on my favorite dish! The front desk concierge at my hotel (Drury) recommended Fabio's because they were close, delivered until 4 am, and they were her favorite wing place. I gotta say, I was very impressed. I could order online from my room, they called when they were pulling up to the hotel, the food was piping hot, and the wings were really big! I got two orders of wings and an order of boneless wings. Great flavor, great bleu cheese (very important!), and delivered before the 45 minute estimate."}
{"text":"I wish there was negative stars. Do NOT order from this place. They will tell you 45-60 minutes. You will be lucky if it arrives in 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Horrible, horrible, horrible service. I thought maybe just unlucky with reviews. NOPE.   Update - I cancelled the pizza. On second call I was told to go downstairs driver was there. NOT. 10 mins later no driver. I called back and response was, \"let me check...\" Really, REALLY...  DO. NOT. ORDER. FROM. THIS. AWFUL. ESTABLISHMENT."}
{"text":"Awful. One of the plainest tasting, ketchup on cardboard craptasic excuses for pizza I've ever had the displeasure of consuming.  Don't get me wrong, every pizza in Cleveland sucks, fabio is no exception.  Because so many pizza dumps in this city don't deliver, or they have bankers hours,  I decided to give fabio a 2nd chance.  Big mistake.  The guy who answered the phone tried to charge me $15 delivery fee. For what? The sorry blah pizza they make? Lol no thanks joker. Can't wait to get home to NY.   Steer clear of slobios, it's not worth the calories."}
{"text":"Ordered at like 2 AM, they delivered quickly. Decent pizza."}
{"text":"Called to order delivery on the phone. Extremely rude. I was calmly and politely giving him all the information that was needed, address and due to the mans lack of english skills (I assume due to the very heavy accent) it was very hard to communicate. This doesn't bother me, as I am very patient in these situations and I am willing to clarify what I am saying as many times as needed. He was not as patient and started yelling at me over the phone. Terrible way to treat your customers."}
{"text":"Fabio's Pizza. Well if you can just jump through the flaming hoop of ordering .. it's worth it. The guy on the phone was rushed, unfriendly, and abrupt. Seemed exasperated and a bit crude. I was worried, but decided to go through with the order as I had just given my credit card info.   Turns out the food arrived SO FAST.. it was hardly to be believed! Seriously no longer then 15 mins later our fresh pizza and wings arrived. It was downright startling how fast there was a knock at our door.   Anyhow the pizza and wings were both well above average. The overall menu has a nice selection of pizza varieties and a wide range of Italian food menu options to choose from. It's fabulous that they deliver as that is a rarity in my neighborhood. There website is nice and user friendly enough. Bravo for having one. The pricing is reasonable and we love the included fridge magnet.. that will remind us to order again. We defiantly will be. My only hope is that the guy on he phone will be more friendly and patient next time."}
{"text":"It's 1:30am.  Three tipsy girlfriends have just stumbed their way back to their hotel room after a rockin' wedding reception @ the Silver Grille.  The late night munchies hit...  Thank goodness I grabbed a flyer for Fabio's from the hotel lobby earlier that day.  The 24 hour delivery written in bold caught my eye.  The delivery man was not only prompt but patient.  It's not an easy task to find one's credit card and hotel key card after one too many vodka tonics.  Our bacon mushroom pizza & bbq wings hit the spot!  Maybe the alcohol is doing the talking on this review, but I have two other friends that can back me up!...oh wait, they're still passed out."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but I love their pizza. Have been ordering for years. It's kind of far from me in the suburbs so whenever i have a late night downtown on my way home I'll call in the pizza and pick it up on the way. The Transylvania pizza is the best!!"}
{"text":"Day/Time: Friday night 8:30  I will agree with other Yelp reviews that have said it seemed like the man who takes the orders on the phone was rude and rushed. He was definitely foreign, so eh, sometimes that's just the pattern of his speech or whatever.   Two medium pies w/ 2 toppings =$24.   Now as far as the pizza itself, meh. It wasn't \"bad\", but it was certainly as they say, \"nothing to write home about.\" Another one of my personal dislikes is that Fabio's like many other pizza places in town chooses for cost purposes I'm sure, to use canned mushrooms. They wind up being kind of squidgy compared to fresh mushrooms which retain that earthy flavor while baking. But again, that's a personal preference.   Delivery was close to estimated time, about an hour.   Overall if I had no choice, this could be a reorder, but probably not. Best pizza we've had delivered to Ohio City came from Guy's downtown. We've ordered from Nunzio's and it was a greasy, sloppy mess that we sent back. The search for GOOD pizza delivered to the OHC continues. There's a lucrative business just waiting to be had - someone is really missing out!"}
