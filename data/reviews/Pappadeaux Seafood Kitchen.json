{"text":"This place has been my favorite restaurant for 10 years.  It's amazing!  I always get the Mediterranean Calamari and oysters on half shell... But truthfully... Everything is awesome!  5 star!  Highly recommend if u enjoy seafood!"}
{"text":"The food is certainly worth the wait and our waiter, Nathan M. tended to our every need. Nathan was great and must have refilled my water four times. The only reason for knocking off one star is really a suggestion for management. At 8:00 p.m., we waited outside, in 101 degree heat for 35 minutes. The heat was oppressive and the outdoor ceiling and standing fans were completely ineffective; in fact, they made the heat more unbearable. I might suggest, especially when you have older patrons, that you assign a wait staff to provide water to those waiting outside. Follow the example of home builders in the Phoenix area; you can't walk into one of their model homes without a salesperson offering a cold bottle of water. Your waiters should be offering glasses of water to your patrons waiting outside, especially when temperatures exceed 100 degrees."}
{"text":"My first visit to Pappadeaux didn't start off well. I decided to grab a quick dinner to avoid rush hour traffic back from Phoenix to Chandler, and Pappadeaux looked good. I waited almost 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge me, in spite of a half dozen servers standing nearby talking about their various life dramas. (It was 115 degrees that day, and ice water was definitel at the top of my list of \"must haves,\" seconded by a glass of wine.) 

As I started to leave, determined to find a restaurant that actually welcomed its customers, an astute server -- Johnnie -- realized I was ready to bail and proceeded to treat me like a queen for the next 45 minutes. 

I was sitting next to the dessert tray and he said, since I'd waited to be served, the restaurant would treat me to a dessert. I don't eat dessert, but I tried to be gracious in light of his offer, so I said thank you. Johnnie realized it wasn't going to be my thing. I ordered the filet topped with crabmeat and a wonderful sauce. It was perfectly cooked according to my request, and certainly didn't need anything extra to enhance its flavor. Johnnie talked to his manager and, after his talk, I was comp'd my meal (less my two glasses of excellent wine). I told his manager that Johnnie had saved the day. The manager said the person who was working my area of the restaurant hadn't shown up for work that day. I didn't really appreciate the excuse. A half dozen servers were within 8 feet of me and could have seen I wasn't been served. But Johnnie did -- and took responsibility. Good for him!

The food was excellent. (I'm not a big seafood eater, but the sauce for the steak accompanied by the crab was perfectly seasoned.) Johnny earned a handsome tip because of his attentiveness, and the restaurant earned a second chance in the future.

But I think I'll ask for Johnny as my server.

{"text":"Love the bar and outside seating. Great atmosphere. Bartenders were awesome. The fresh lobster is fantastic. The only problem is that it is very loud and very crowded so it doesn't make for a great \"date\" place. Good family dining though."}
{"text":"The unyielding devotion to this chain (which is a half step above Bubba Gump's) is quite amazing, but they truly live up to their good rep.  I had a great time here.

I have family in Texas that rave about this chain, so when I when I drove by this one in Phoenix, I knew I had to check it out.  And as fate would have it, a friend decided to bring me here for happy hour.  We were on a mission to try the Category 5.  This is a blended drink which combines a house Margarita with a Hurricane.  This won't knock you out like a Hurricane, but it definately packs a punch.  What kind of punch you ask?  The one that let's you think that ordering FRIED Calamari (with artichokes), FRIED catfish (I think) and FRIED Alligator is a good idea.  

Yeah, I said it.  \"FRIED GATOR\".

Yes, it tasted like chicken, and it was delicious.  I think after a Category 5, they could have fried up the sole of a shoe and I would have liked it.  This place has great ambiance, and a good fun, festive vibe."}
{"text":"Loved it! I had a reserved a table in advance and we were able to get a table outside in one of the balconies. Super gorgeous! The food was delicious and very rich. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"By far one of the best places out there to eat. No matter what I order it never disappoints me. Most definitely need to try som Fried Alligator."}
{"text":"Quality keeps going down, prices going up.  I have tried crab cakes ( my absolute favorite) at every restaurant in the Valley.  Pappadeaux has always had the best I could find. I go here strictly for those! They were lightly fried, large in size,tons of crab with a delectable sauce with bits of crawfish, that made you want to lick the plate. I was just there and their new crab cakes don't even vaguely resemble the former. Deep fried small ball/patties with little taste of crab and a watery sauce with unidentifiable white fish with no taste to it whatsoever. Price went slightly up and these are horrible. No need to go back."}
{"text":"The seafood here just tastes so fresh! Great preparation and selection of food. This was the first time I tried the oysters and they were great. Knowledgeable staff too. I just don't like the ambience that much bc it just seems too crowded"}
{"text":"Food was great best alligator around the Mediterranean calamari was yummy and a delightfully different taste."}
{"text":"Even though I had a reservation here, I fully expected to have to wait a while for my table.  Parking lot packed-check. Lots of folks on the entrance patio-check. Large group exiting while i'm entering-check. Yep it's going to be a long wait. But it wasn't! We were seated immediately and our server, Rio, came over and promptly introduced himself.
Let me tell you this: Rio's attention to our table was first class.  He was very amiable and was patient and engaging with my too talkative and over sharing father.  Rio made us feel like we were his only customers.  He did his best to make sure that we were satisfied. Ask to be seated in Rio's section if you want great service.
We ordered 1/2 dozen blue points on the half shell.  Seven of those succulent oysters arrived at our table with ketchupy cocktail sauce, horseradish and mignonette as toppings.  The mignonette was tasty and who doesn't love raw horseradish! Yummy!
My Dad and I both had naked scallops with broccolini, and lemon caper sauce on the side for our main.  I specifically asked Rio for steamed veg, no butter.  The plates arrived with four scallops not three (because of their size, I guess) and a shiny portion of broccolini. I asked Rio again for just steamed veg and he happily complied with a smile and a new portion arrived within minutes - still shiny.  Rio brought another serving as well in case I wasn't satisfied. Rio really is a customer service pro!
Scallops were delicious and perfectly cooked although the lemon caper sauce was undistinguished. Three servings of identical broccolini convinced me that they must spray oil on the veg in the kitchen. I just don't get that.
I'd give Pappadeaux food 3.5 stars but Rio's service elevates my rating to four."}
{"text":"For the past five years my family travels to Phoenix to visit Pappadeauxs for my moms birthday. My family is from Louisiana and we all now live in California so Cajun food is such a treat. Pappadeauxs is awesome! What stands out is the amazing service and high quality food. We had a party of 16 one day and 18 the next. We called ahead and made reservations and were lucky to get a private room and Jamie as our server both days. SHE IS EXCEPTIONAL! She kept our drinks full, catered to our every need, timed the courses perfectly and even remembered everyone's favorite drinks/dishes the second day. The food is always great! Our group had everything from steak, chicken tenders and pasta to oysters, redfish, and pan fried soft shelled crab. Every dish was served hot and at the same time. Can't wait to go back next year!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, beautiful ambiance and great location. 

The food was amazing providing you with real cajun flavor and large portions. The fried gator was delicious and the service was very prompt and professional. the drinks were also really great. I will definitely be coming here more often when i visit phoenix again!"}
{"text":"This place is more hype than anything. Being from the south, I was surrounded by places that fried-up seafood, which is apparently what this place is all about. It has some more \"cajun\" style things than I'm used to, like fried frog legs, but still same concept: food put in a deep fat fryer. Yippee.

Being bored with such fried vittles, I opted for shrimp creole with andouille cheese grits. It was okay, but for the price ($22.50) it was a huge rip-off. I was with my company and thus wasn't paying, but I'd be mad if I had paid 23 bucks for a few shrimp in an average creole with an ice cream scoop full of grits.

I got their New York cheesecake, too, but it was typical restaurant (think Applebee's) quality, complete with food-colored cherry sauce.

The highlight of the place was the service, as our waitress and hostess were both very nice and attentive. The atmosphere is all right, too, but still pretty typical of a cookie-cutter franchise like Olive Garden.

I dunno, maybe I sound like a fuddy-duddy, but certainly not as exciting or \"authentic\" as other reviewers would have you believe."}
{"text":"I do love coming to this spot, it's always lively and the food is usually good. I returned for Happy Hour with a gift card given to me by Pappadeaux because they had over charged me and admitted to 'bad service'. (very nice!) My first catfish app had 6 pieces, 2nd had 3, why? Ordered a glass of wine and was told happy hour was over even though it was 6:05. (ends at 6:30) Bartender..'Oh, sorry..\" Got my bill and again they had charged me for an extra drink. Bartender, 'Oh, sorry..\" They applied my gift certificate and it was still incorrect. Paid and left. I'm not complaining to management again. Fun and crowded place but be sure to check your bill, seems they consistently make mistakes."}
{"text":"The Halibut and was tasty and service was good. Only reason not a 5 star was the price. Spent $130 for two with a drink each and tip. Wife and I didn't choose the cheaper items on the menu but I will try this place again."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Not as amazing as I expected because the flavor was there on some things but overall hit and miss. When there was flavor it was AMAZING. Definitely worth trying not so sure it was worth the price but I will probably come back and see if it's better next time."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! I try something new every time and they've never let me down! Everything from the fried alligator to the crawfish to the costa rican tilapia w/ lobster taste like a little piece of heaven!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a Father's Day tradition for us. I'm a huge fried seafood fan. The Pappadeaux Platter is what I enjoy. Can't beat the Craw-fish."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight! This is a really nice, spacious restaurant with an outdoor area that had live music tonight. We ate indoors though, and the decor and general ambiance was really nice. Not so uptight as to make you feel uncomfortable to eat with your family, but certainly befitting the price range and quality.

I have a few minor quibbles that would make this more of a 4.5 star review, but I thought I'd round up since they're so insignificant.

To begin with, the food and beverages were good! I had the Strawberry Tea and my mom had the Mango Lemonade, and they were both flavorful without tasting artificial. No review on the alcoholic drinks, unfortunately. The meals were VERY generously sized (Seriously, we all took home enough to have a second and possibly third meal tomorrow) and good... for the most part. The fried crabfinger dinner was a bit salty and the lobster bisque might not be for everyone. The clam chowder and pasta mardi gras were amazing though. Also, beware the dirty rice--the taste really lives up to the name, and you may not be prepared for it. My mom, thinking it was just a clever name for a rice pilaf, certainly wasn't.

Service was great! Our waiter was very ninja-like, suddenly reappearing with refills. He was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. Our only issue was that at one point, as we were at the end of our meal, he seemed to disappear completely. We wanted to get our plates boxed and our check paid, and that took much longer than we expected. Still, it wasn't exactly a hassle waiting for him to show up and I'm sure we could have been more proactive about getting the bill if we had really been in a rush.

In short, a great place to dine if you don't mind spending a bit of money. Considering this is seafood and they give you huge plates, I think the cost is definitely worth it, but don't be surprised to see those $20-$30+ entrees."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I ate here and we enjoyed the aura and ambiance of the place. The Shrimp Brochette is to die for!"}
{"text":"I ate here with a friend about a week ago and we both got the most horrible food poisoning ever!! Plus, we waited over 45 minutes for a table when the place was nearly empty. The host staff was extremely rude. The manager and our waiter were helpful and friendly but they're food is unsafe. Never ever eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite places until a friend of mine and I came down with food poisoning that made me wish for death. Notified them and they apologized and said they'd send a gift card for a future meal. Never received it, but would NEVER go back anyway."}
{"text":"The BEST seafood every time we go and great service too!!! We had the best lobster we have ever had !!! The fried alligator with that dip is amazing !!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I live in AZ, and have gone here many times. HOWEVER, it seems almost 90% of the time my food/soup/appetizers are NOT HOT!!! I took a good look over the rest of the yelp reviews to see if anyone else said anything about the temp of the food. Nobody has said anything, which really surprises me! Do people like food that is not hot? The last visit I made to Pappadeux I really wanted to ENJOY my meal without having to return it to be \"nuked\" so I told the waiter of my issues and he looked at me like I was crazy - I AM NOT CRAZY!!! Hahah I swear my food is just not hot enough, and it's not like I want it to burn my mouth off I just don't want it to be - warm! That is not SUFFICIENT. Hot meal please, yes thank you! I pay good money, I want hot soup. I want HOT seafood not WARM. The waiter said something about how they need to cook it at a certain temp...um yes I know how to cook seafood that doesn't mean it's served warm.... along with everything else on the dish that is NOT seafood. Nice try. So I guess I have sort of a love/hate relationship with this place. If they would just serve it hot the first time, I would be in heaven.. /end rant."}
{"text":"I had dinner to celebrate my wife's birthday on a Friday evening. The atmosphere was awesome, bustling and busy.  It reminded me of New Orleans .  The food was amazing I had coconut shrimp , Cajun red snapper with a seafood topper; crawfish, scallops and crab. The dirty rice was super tasty.  Dessert was creme brûlée.  The service was great.  I look forward to coming again."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food was amazing,who cares if it's  chain restaurant.
      We had tried to go the night before but they were packd so we made a reservation for the next night.It was really busy when we go there but we were seated immediately.Our server was really nice and very helpful when we told him we had never been there before.
           We ordered the fried alligator app,and loved every bite of it.I had the filet mignon and rock lobster tail.The steak was cooked perfectly and was a good size for the price.I'm not usually a huge fan of lobster but wanted to give it a try,Pappadeux has changed my opinion about lobster,the meat  came right out of the tail.It was buttery andjust plain yummy! It was the first chance hubby and I really had a chance to go out to eat without the kids,so we really wanted to make the most of our time.And we wre definetly able to do that here.Refills kept coming even after we had paid the bill.I also loved the live music from the jazz quartet making its way around the room.The only thing thats keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the tables were too close to each other,and it was so loud I could hear the discussion at the table next to me but I had a hard time hearing my huband across the table.I will definetly be going back to Pappadeux over and over again."}
{"text":"It is only a short time in spring when crawfish are in season and on Wednesdays and Thursdays, this place flies them in fresh and offers them until they run out.  I am addicted to the mudbugs and have been to Pappadeauxs 5 times since mid March to get my fill of them.  The bartenders recognize me by now.  I have been going in every season for the past 4-5 years.  Usually I sit at the bar and find the service to be friendly and top notch.  I most often start with a half dozen raw oysters and then move on to the crawfish.  Oh, boy, are they good and go perfectly with an ice cold Shiner Bock draft!   Took my mom last week and we sat at the bar.  Had some mussels to start.  Very good again.  Even though this place is packed every time I go in, there never seems to be a break in the service quality.  I have also been in recently with a large group and sat in the dining room.  Fantastic meal.  We all had something different and everyone was pleased.  A little loud for my liking but that is to be expected when a place is as busy as this restaurant always seems to be.   Don't let the metro location scare you off.  Quality seafood and quality service."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux is an excellent place to have delicious seafood in the Phoenix area.  They have a wide selection and every time I've eaten here the service was prompt and courteous, the meals well prepared, and they always seem pretty busy.  I had the Caribbean lobster tail, scallops, and shrimp wrapped in bacon followed by key lime pie.  Everything was cooked to perfection and I always try to eat at  Pappadeaux when I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"OMG!! What a fantastic first experience!  Everything was top notch starting with our waiter, Blake who gave us a brief history of the restaurant and a great explanation of the menu. Our drinks were out of this world and I can't say enough about the food.  It was an exceptional experience and we were celebrating our 8 yr wedding Anniversary and we are so glad we came here to do so. Will definitely be back with bells on!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, the most recent of which was Wednesday evening for their annual crawfish broil (offered Wednesdays and Thursdays through March and April).  The seafood here is pretty fresh and service is usually top-notch.  

I'm not a fan of crawfish, but my friends always rave about it, so I gave it a shot. I played it safe and ordered the 1 1/4 lb option ($7.95) while they ordered 2.5 lbs ($15.90).  I ate about four of the crawfish and sorry folks, still not a fan.  The seasoning was too spicy and salty.  I ate the corn and gave the rest of the crawfish away.  I'll stick to crab, lobster or shrimp  - more meat.

I ordered the jumbo lump crab cake ($13.95) and shared an order of the P.E.I. mussels ($10.95). The crab cake was delicious - kudos to them for not skimping on the meat.  I was not a fan of mussels before Pappadeaux, but now I'm hooked and always order their P.E.I. mussels.  

This place seems to always be packed, regardless of which day of the week it is."}
{"text":"Love it.    Best seafood away from the ocean.  The bread pudding desert is to die for but if you're too full for desert take home a banana pudding."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was awesome, great courtyard area, open kitchen. Service was top notch. Food was incredible! Very fresh, didn't have the typical give of a chain restaurant. My boyfriend and I went on catfish night and though we didn't get any it was fun to watch everyone get their buckets. Cocktail was yummy.. calamari melted in my mouth, halibut in burre blanc was amazing."}
{"text":"My team of 54 people left well fed and commening on how effecient and friendly the wait staff were. With our large group they worked with us on price and selection. Way too much food in the end. The shrimp brochette over tender and spicy dirty rice- excellent. I hated the fact that I ate soo much of my key lime pie but even though I was bursting at the seams I couldn't help myself. Good food. Good service. Very pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was great but not as great as out waiter Anthony ABad he really made our dinner awesome and gave us the best service We will be back and will make sure to sit in Anthony's section"}
{"text":"Best seafood place I have found in the Phoenix area.

Everything from the crab dip to the crab legs and oysters is delicious. They have a wonderful fish selection as well and even their steaks are good.

Service has always been excellent every time I have gone.

Can get very busy on nights so try and go early if you can."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night for Me and My Hubs 19th Wedding Anniv. We got there at 5:30 and had reservations for 6:00, so we headed to the bar and had a cocktail to waste away a half an hour. The bartenders were fast and courteous.  I had a margarita; not bad but to sour for my liking. Hub had a draft beer and it was served in an ice, ice, ice cold mug. At 6:00 we were seated at our table right away and our server, Gerald, was at our table in an instant with pen in hand asking us if we had been to Pappadeaux before and if we had any questions before he informed us about the menu. We had the lump crab spinach dip for a starter, good flavor but not much lump crab to be found in ours.  We had the fried soft shell crab for our dinner and it was YUMMMMMMMMY!!!  All in All it's a great place for seafood, just be prepared to open your wallett $$."}
{"text":"Yes!!!! It's expensive, but it's soooooo good. Our table had the salmon, shrimp and grits, oysters, and a seafood salad. It was all delicious! I just wish this location was closer to the city. If you want good Cajun seafood, just go try it!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! My partner and I had our first date here and have been addicted ever since!!

Étouffée till I die!! It's amazing! 

All the staff is awesome, the bands/performers they have are way awesome and on point for the atmosphere!! 

Quickness of service is surprising considering they are ALWAYS busy! 

LOVE THIS PLACE!! Try it!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the family and would Defenetly be back; staff was great and food was darn good. Wait wasn't to bad and the enviornment wall busy was pretty relaxing. We had 5 people in our group that all got something different and everyone loved what they got."}
{"text":"We read all the reviews and we super excited to go with our kids to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary...sorely disappointed. Just a step above red lobster. Started with alligator and calimari app. Alligator was good as was calimari but we ordered large portions of each. I think we got 10 nuggets of gator and the calimari was more fried artichoke hearts than calimari. At $20 a pop a real disappointment.
Entrees were masked by butter and heavy cream sauce. No real flavor and again at these prices the fish should have been incredibly fresh. 
On the positive side, the desserts were very good. Had the cheese cake and seven layer cake. 
Our service was wonderful. Ashleigh was charming, attentive and prompt. Unfortunately not enough. I would never go back. A shame. Also made me lose confidence in Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"The Chilean Sea Bass was so well caught  packed, cooked and prepared I can not imagine a seafood experience in the middle of the desert so exceptional. It's no mirage. Great service! Worth the drive. Ill be back."}
{"text":"A must if you are in the area!! We had a party of 6 and everyone was pleased with their meal. The decor gives you that New Orleans vibe. We were seated promptly although it was very crowded.   The crab legs ate HUGE, mussels very flavorful and the fried platters are amazing!"}
{"text":"In town for business, and came to Pappadeaux's for dinner...what a great experience.  Hostess, wait staff, and servers were all outstanding.  The food was amazing.  Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi.  Ice cold beer on a hot, 102 degree day was a welcome addition!

Although we later found out our waiter was in training (it was his first day), he was attentive, professional, and available to answer any questions we had.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm here on business and this came as a recommendation from where I'm working and I am glad they did! The food was absolutely delicious, menu choices abundant yet easy to read and the service was stellar. I had the cedar plank salmon and it was so tender and juicy! A little bit high on the price, but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I USED TO LOOOOVE THIS PLACE!!!! It has gotten a bit grimy around the edges of late, been around for a long time and they have never really changed anything. The food is usually A+ I wish they would try to incorporate more or any organic food options in their menu because that would allow a lot more people to enjoy the food a lot more often!!  And, it would explain the super high prices :/ WHEW!  $25.00 for 6 medium-large sized shrimp they call Jumbo wrapped in bacon, stuffed with some cheese and jalapeno yea it has the cheese and jalepeno inside...gets my mouth watering at the thought of how delicious it is but is too expensive to enjoy but maybe once a year or on a very special occasion.  Good food but everything is fried and sometimes the dirty rice has weird chunks in it...not sure if it is grizzle from sausage or something else from the meat(s) in the dirty rice.."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and it was hard to find parking, but we got seated right away! The shrimp brochette is by far the best shrimp every! This will definitely be a repeat dinner destination."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*

My hunny loves this place, so we went for his birthday last Friday. I'm glad I made reservations because the restaurant was packed (like sardines *har har*) when we arrived at 6:30 pm. It was VERY LOUD inside...This is NOT a good place for a first date because my husband and I were practically yelling and we still could barely hear each other. The 4-man N'awlins band playing was complimentary to the atmosphere, but the music just added to the din. Phil was our waiter and he was friendly and personable.

We started with soup...hubs enjoyed his shrimp gumbo, although he and I thought my cup of lobster bisque was better (my mouth is watering as I'm typing this!) The french bread that came out before the meal was standard and nothing special. My entree was filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I also added king crab legs which my sweetie and I shared. The filet was cooked right, but didn't have much flavor...had to ask for A-1 (gasp!) The asparagus were downright delicious and the taters were yummy too. Crab legs were fresh and tasty. I liked the tealight our server brought to the table to melt the butter for my crab because it kept the butter melted throughout dinner. My husband got mahi mahi with etouffee on top (came with dirty rice) and he was transported to food heaven.

I had a weird experience when I excused myself to go to the restroom. After admiring my hair, a woman (that I had never met) told me she was a spiritualist, said she saw lots of tension around me, and saw lots of change in my future. All I saw was the crab shell that had lodged itself in my eye when I had attempted to crack it. Along with the tears running down my cheek because of said crab shell. Bet you can imagine how annoying it was to be accosted in the bathroom...and it was......but I just can't be rude to someone who says I have pretty hair. Even if she was a wacka-doo.

Next time we go to Pappadeaux's I'm going to avoid the crab and the ladies restroom.......

Just kidding.

I'll still get the crab."}
{"text":"As a non-seafood eater, I was extremely pleasantly surprised with this restaurant! It is certainly a seafood driven menu, but if you're like me, you will have the option of mozerella sticks for an appetizer, several salads, and chicken tenders or chicken pasta. And the chicken tenders were absolutely delicious- very moist. My seafood loving husband enjoyed the alligator bites and catfish immensely. 

The service really pushed Pappadeux above and beyond on my list. Our waitress, Esther, was so sweet and professional and did a great job of taking care of us without hovering. We will most certainly be back, maybe next time for Happy hour on the absolutely gorgeous Nola style patio!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend before I leave phx. Didn't think to find good Cajun food in Arizona?!? What great food, drinks and atmosphere. We had the fried crocodile for appetizer and I had the shrimp etoufee for my main course, which was to die for. I highly  recommend this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I wanted to order the Caesar salad until I asked about the ingredients and found out that it is not a true Caesar, but is made with soybean oil mayo.  94% of all soy has been genetically modified.  If you want more info on GMOs (genetically modified organisms) watch \"Genetic Roulette\" on YouTube.  No human safety studies were done on GMOs before these poisons were unleashed on an unsuspecting public.  In animal studies they have been shown to cause tumors.

The residue from rBGH in milk reduces has been linked to breast cancer.  I only buy organic when it comes to these products as they can't be genetically modified."}
{"text":"Good basic Cajun without too much spiciness. Had shrimp with cheese grits and was not disappointed. Although certainly not a Paul Prudhomme type of Cajun meal it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"There's really so much to say about Pappa's. I've been a repeat customer for over 20 years. Go and try it yourself and see why!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed! I went with my husband for his birthdaThe wait time was less than 5 minutes, the restaurant is beautiful and the food was amazing but .... we have waited 10 min to get our drinks, another 15 minutes to get bread and another 10 minutes to get our food. Total we waited 35 minutes from when we placed our order to get our food and the worse is that our plates were cold --'. My husband and I are two bites and decided to take it home. Another 20 Minutes to get the check and boxes. Too expensive for the service we got! Bad experience! 


Update

After my review the manager nicely mailed me a gift card to try again. This time the service was perfect, Brooke was really nice, effective, and quick! The food amazing as usual!! I am giving a 5 stars BUT the tables are really too close to each other :/!"}
{"text":"Expect your 20 minute wait time to be more like an hour. Zero respect for their patrons time. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food and service is amazing. The portions seem to be getting smaller while the prices continue to go up but overall it's a great restaurant."}
{"text":"this restaurant has really good quality seafood. the menu is large. the restaurant is large, romantic and has a separate bar area. it's very pretty and classy on the inside, but not snooty, meaning you can go casual and relax. the food has always been good especially the catfish. the prices are ok.  they're generally anywhere from $11-$15 for a really nice meal. of course there's pricier choices depending what you're getting.  it's a great atmosphere especially for a romantic date. the only downside, IT'S ALWAYS PACKED WHETHER YOU GO THERE FOR LUNCH OR DINNER. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK. IT'S ALWAYS SUPER BUSY. if it's an especially busy nite like a friday or saturday, they will give you a pager. sometimes the wait is over 1 hour. alot of those people go to fridays directly next door for cheaper drinks then go back to pappadeaux when it's gets closer to getting a table."}
{"text":"This is a weekend must. Delicious oysters along with great music. Servers are with smiles and bar service is fast."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner here on 7/22.  P.H.I.L. was our waiter and he was phenomenal !  Food was GREAT! As was service!    Highly recommend this place!  Sat outside and was very comfortable!   Will be back again and again!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a very picky eater and could not say one bad thing about this place. Jarrett was our waiter and did an awesome job. New everything about the menu like he made it himself. My boyfriend is allergic to nuts and the concern they took was above and beyond. Ask for Jarrett!"}
{"text":"I was very happy to see that there was a Pappadeaux here - a little bit of home!  It gets busy at peak times so either go early or plan to wait a bit. The food is excellent so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Unbelievable how fresh the seafood is, especially since it's located in Arizona. Took my hubby here for his bday and the atmosphere was perfect! Awesome cocktails as well! They just need to get rid of all the soliciters out front."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with my girlfriend. Prices weren't bad $5-$10 for items on the happy hour menu. Bar staff was pretty nice and helpful, get there early for a seat, the place fills up pretty quick. We had the orange peel shrimp and the mushroom/cheese fondeaux, one of those (thinking the fondeaux) make us both really sick that night. If we do go back we will definitely be avoiding it."}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss 50/50.
Once I got an awesome andoulie sausage with seasoned rice.
Another time, I got very bland pasta with way too much grease and very little seasoning.
I guess it all depends on what you order.

Wait times are moderate to long depending on what time you get there.

I like the misters in the waiting area in the summer.

Pretty cool decor, especially the outdoor fountain area.
Kind of nice when the lights turn on."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Phoenix being from Bx, N.Y it's no City Island but the next best thing! !!!!"}
{"text":"always consistent quality and value. we have been regulars of pappadeaux in our previous  home of TX, and we still are big fans!"}
{"text":"Very nice and beautiful restaurant, prices are very nice $$$ not a cheap restaurant but not really hight end either. We used to eat weekly,  and so many time ordered  oyster found some dead for many day, and lobster frozen undercooked but management seem to be  fine with this but not us. We asked our waitress less salt but she answered that is our concep, ok then salt and fat are the most killer for human immune system and blood pressure, we care about it and pay $$$ for fresh & healthy food but not getting weak with all the heath issue. Thanks for nice concept but we will skip Papadeaux even we love the ambiance and decor. A New manager recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered the mixed seafood platter but found that it had been \"too\" deep fried and therefore too heavy for us. We should have ordered something like a grilled fish. Friends of ours rave about this restaurant so we'll have to try it again and next time be more selective about what we order."}
{"text":"Recently my husband & I joined some friends for dinner at Pappadeaux's in Phoenix. Neither my husband or I had ever been &, based on our experience we won't go back.  For the prices, we expected better.  We each had a drink but, the glasses were filled with ice & just a sliver of liquor. We all ran out of drinks, including water & iced tea, as our server never checked on us. Everything is ala carte, with a baked potato being an extra $2.60 & even though we asked for butter & sour cream, the potatoes were dry. Our friend's wife ordered a dinner salad which did not come until after the entrées were served & she asked about it. As it was a different server who delivered our entrees, he had to tell our server who, upon finally delivering the salad, lied saying she, \"had to yell at the kitchen\" for it.  My shrimp, which I was told would be large & butterflied, were as small as popcorn shrimp & our friend's scallops were undercooked.  She did mention this to the server but, at no time did the server offer to get the manager to make it right.  $250.00 meal. I will not return or recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"First time diners at this great restaurant and have nothing but great things to say! My hubby and I celebrated our 18th wedding anniversary Saturday night and after asking friends where we should go, most suggested Pappadeaux. Of course when I called for reservations, the time I wanted was fully booked. However the hostess suggested I call 15 minutes before getting there to be put on the wait list (which was a 30 min wait)... Did what she suggested and after checking in, getting the pager, only had to wait another 5 mins! Driving almost 30 mins to get there ... This was awesome! LOL

We had two waiters (I think one was training or was paired with our main waiter) were wonderful. The one who greeted us, took our drink orders cleared our plates after each course and filled our water glasses was so welcoming. (I have to say, while we were being seated, we crossed paths with a few wait staff and all said \" welcome to Pappadeaux\".)  Our main waiter, Sam, was THE BEST. I asked him what he liked and he recommended the Mahi Alexander... Which I ordered!  My husband ordered the filet and lobster combo. Everything was cooked to perfection. The steak was so tender, the lobster was so buttery and tasty and my Mahi Mahi was paired perfectly with the dirty rice and the creamy crawfish.  YUMMMMMY!!!!

Of course, we couldn't finish everything ... Oh, and the baked oysters were soooo good! We ordered the Oyster Duo for our appetizer ... We also order the banana bread pudding for dessert... Also good! Our girl waiter took our dessert order and asked if we were celebrating anything special and after telling her it was our anniversary, our dessert came with a note written in strawberry jam \"happy 18th wedding anniversary\" Couldn't finish it all either but was able to take it home in the mason jar it came in. :) 

What a great impression this place gave us! From the gorgeous courtyard with the fountain and live band outside, to the well trained wait staff (BRAVO TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER!) and of course to the EXCELLENT food! We will definitely be coming here again ... And not just for special occasions."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant no matter what location. We had Justin as our server Sat night. He was informative, hospitable and very accommodating. The mussels, gumbo, and lobsters were cooked perfectly. The bread pudding was delicious.  I wish we had one closer to Chandler."}
{"text":"My husband and I had not been to Pappadeaux's for many years and thought we would revisit the restaurant.  Although it was very busy we were seated right away.  The waitress was prompt and helpful giving us suggestions on appetizers and main meal.   We placed our order and the food came out quickly and was hot all though it was busy.  The food tasted great, but why I gave it 4 stars because we found it to be very expensive for the small portions we got."}
{"text":"Ok. Used to be better now I think it's just average. I like things on the spicier side and I think it caters to an older crowd."}
{"text":"My first experience at this chain... I usually try to eat local when traveling but my partner wanted to eat here. The service was absolutely some of the best I have ever. Our server was Matt, he knew the menu forward and back and even offered us an appetizer that wasn't on the menu, blacked alligator, crazy good. The food was great as well, I ordered the Caribbean lobster tail, it was huge and very flavorful. We did have one mix up with the kitchen but Matt explained the situation and handled it. One of the best dining experiences ever. Check them out, and ask for Matt, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Its a Thursday night and the kids are at Grandma's house. Catfish and shrimp are two of my favorites and they were excellent here. The place is packed yet the service was still great. I've been coming here for years and will continue to. And The shrimp and crab fondue is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I won't lie, Pappadeaux's used to be WAY better years ago, but it's still a great place to go with flavorful fare. My absolute favorite dish is actually the stuffed crab, which is an appetizer but I order as an entree. Bread pudding and Banana pudding are both delish! Attentive staff. Can get loud, very busy, long waits some days, but is to be expected for a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good, seafood  nice to find fresh and wonderful seafood in Phoenix Az. Casual fun and delicious!"}
{"text":"2nd visit. Tonight, Saturday.  15 min wait, Nice drink at bar. Dozen blue point oysters w/ 3 sauces:Great. Mussels w/sausage large bowl: tender, tasty broth, good broth. Salad:okay. Crap Mac/cheese over cooked. Waiter took off bill. And offered a free desert. Crab cake/sauce was excellent. So satisfied, didn't even need free desert. I hope to go back in two weeks. Great staff, great mix of happy people enjoying the night"}
{"text":"Restaurant: Came at night and the restaurant and decor was what was expected, lively and a little loud.

Service: Was seated right away. Server was very quick and food came out quickly. Drink refills were done timely.

Food: Ordered the spinach dip. It was excellent. Sampled some of the other food from friends' plates and they were all good."}
{"text":"We had the crab cake and spinach dip appetizer which was very good.  I had the crawfish platter with fried crawfish, etouffee crawfish and dirty rice.   The rice had a crunch and seemed under cooked, the crawfish was alright."}
{"text":"I am all about good Cajun food. I wasn't expecting to find it in Phoenix, but I sure did! I had catfish with shrimp etouffe, and the traditional calamari as an appetizer. The calamari tasted fresh, and wasn't like the cheap rubberband-like calamari you find at bad restaurants. The catfish was light and flaky, but the shrimp etouffe was my favorite by far. 

The decor reminded me of New Orleans. It was beautiful weather to sit outside, and the waiter was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Everything's bigger in Texas, including the crab cakes!!!  My review says lacking because I'm from Texas so I know what Pappadeaux should be.  I gave it three stars bc I can't bring myself to rate a Pappa chain alongside Red Lobster. I have frequented (and I mean often) the Pappa chain in Dallas and Austin.  The AZ restaurant obviously has the same recipes bc the sauces are unforgettable but their portions, especially the crab cakes, are tiny. They do have the same mutant huge potatoes.  

I was primarily disappointed with the service, mediocre at best where as, coming from TX, I was expecting the normal Pappa hospitality and bend over backwards to leave an impression - staff.  It was early evening and the sun was setting. I was literally told I could not move, nor could the blinds be lowered, despite being blinded by the sun in my face.   It's saddens me to have this restaurant tarnish an amazing name. Save your money bc you have the same steep prices but not half the experience!  Btw Pappadeaux in TX was my favorite restaurant - Austin and Dallas, I assumed they were all that good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Our server was Amanda, she was unbelievably attentive, especially for how busy they were, and extremely sweet to my children. It was our first time there and I already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here every so often, generally the server is decent and the food is just decent as well. But this specific time I came to Pappadeaux my server was a very nice girl named Jada, she made me feel like she actually cares about the tables she was serving, without interrupting too often, she was very polite and on top of everything. An excellent waitress. Also the manager, Arizania, was very polite too. The food on this day was also very good to add, but without the waitress I wouldn't have bothered to write a review."}
{"text":"we heard about this place so much. so we gave it a try. we both love sea food. mine was ok but nothing special. my husband had a fish - and was sick for three days because of that.  we don't go there any more. high priced but low quality food -"}
{"text":"We LOVE pappadeaux and go every time we are close to one.  Never have been disappointed. We started at the bar with a couple happy hour grey goose lemon drops. Coconut shrimp app followed by cedar plank salmon and stuffed shrimp (unbelievably delish!). We also added some king crab legs and a beer and blood orange mojito. Got out for $112 including $20 tip. Service was top notch food was phenomenal, if I had to knock something the crab legs were a little soggy. Server immediately tried to replace them or comp them but I can't waste crab legs so I ate every scrap of them!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ahi tuna appetizer was delicious as were the cocktails. Our waitress was very friendly. Dinner portions are huge, even split are more than enough for two people. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am not a huge seafood fan but went here for a birthday for a friend. I ordered a steak which I really enjoyed. It was cooked perfectly and was flavorful. My husband ordered the oysters and said they were the best he has ever had. Everyone else really seemed to enjoy their seafood. Gets really busy and I can see why. A little bit pricey but for good food it is worth it. I would rather have quality food, then a quantity of food that doesn't taste good"}
{"text":"Love the Alexander sauce. The mahi is nice too. You cant beat the atmosphere. The problem i have with this place is all the seafood has a hose water aftertaste."}
{"text":"My first time at a cajun seafood kitchen and let me tell you it was great.  I wasn't so sure how the whole experience would go since I don't usually eat fish and I haven't had a lot of experience with cajun food either.  But my hesitation quickly slipped away as the ambiance of the restaurant engulfed me.  This is a fun place.

It was a busy night and so we had cocktails and appetizers on the patio--great patio!  As our table came available, we were escorted inside to nice location by the window.  (I love tables with a view.)  Our waiter was very helpful with the selections explaining in detail which dishes would suit our individual tastes. Nice variety of dishes on the menu.  My ceasar salad was was as nice complement to the shrimp etouffee and dirty rice.  Everything was spiced just right and the favors were just watering.

Our waiter checked back on us periodically, just enough to keep in touch but not be a bother.  He was attentive and concerned that his dinner suggestions met with our approval--they did.  He was very good and I wish I could remember his name, to give him a proper shout out. 

Needless to say, I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix---Love you, Pappadeaux's!"}
{"text":"Great food. Never had a bad meal. The fondeaux is crazy good"}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this location often. We've only had a less than desirable experience once but the waiters and waitresses are usually on top of it and the food is amazing! The seafood is really fresh and you can tell nothing they serve is frozen. A must try for seafood lovers."}
{"text":"Mmm Mmm, love Pappadeaux! Such great cajun/creole style food in a really fun environment. You must try the fondeaux and lobster bisque - my favorites! Always super crowded, so I would def make a reservation."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, the food and bread is outstanding as well as the whole experience and ambiance altogether.  It's a beautiful place, but expensive and should be kept only for special occasions!"}
{"text":"My 2nd favorite happy hour in the valley .  Mix Seafood grilled  skewers over dirty rice.  Is a must try so much food"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. It's a bit pricey, but from what I tasted, you get what you pay for. I had a \"alex-something\" dish, and it was amazing. The menu is huge, and if even half of it tastes as good as what I had, then I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I will be back."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant in Arizona, HANDS DOWN! The Shellfish fondue is absolutely mouth watering.  Wednesday night, I decided to switch it up from my usual Shrimp Montage and got the Atlantic salmon. Holy bejesus, it was exquisite!! (Oh my gosh I am getting hungry just thinking about it!!) The staff is always so incredibly friendly and even though the place is ALWAYS packed, they always seem to find a great seat !  If I could give 6 stars, I would! =)"}
{"text":"Exclusive seafood restaurant... easily the best in the phoenix area. we love the fried frog legs(try pan fried too) . also the crab cakes are awesome.
first time oyster eaters and it was a great experience. 

the items on the lunch and dinner section are very pricey but worth it. too rich in flavor if looking to find a fault. don't buy drinks , even their strongest drink (swamp thing or something like that) was a joke. buy another round of frog legs instead !!!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived checked in and advised about 20-30 minutes. We had waited for 30 minutes, they had advised us twice that they were wiping down the tables. After another 20 minutes we were finally seated.  When we did get to our table the table hadn't been wiped down.  It was dirty, trash(food) around the table, table was not set.  They finally came to wipe down the table. We waited another 5-10 minutes before we ordered drinks.  It took some time before the drinks came.  Typically, we get excellent service and this time was a huge let down.  At this time, we still had no silverware, no settings or anything at our table.  Bread came and it was cold, that is not typical.  The food came and it was mediocre, nothing screamed Pappadeaux, it was a huge let down, the food was luke warm.  Also typically you see a manager that comes around and we didn't see a presence of that last night.  I was very disappointed as this was one of my favorite restaurants as I drive a distance to enjoy the food and it was my daughter, niece and son's birthday."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux is good but it had the feel of a worn-down Red Lobster.  This is not to say the food was not good, but that was the impression that I felt.

I have had the jambalaya and the etoufee here and both were adequate, though I had to douse on the Tabasco to truly make the flavor something I desired.  I would recommend this place to somebody interested in a casual happy hour or a family who wants to eat their fill as the quantity was quite large."}
{"text":"So good! Best seafood in Phoenix. Reminds me of my grandfathers seafood restaurant.  I highly recommend getting some fresh raw oysters and my favorite fish dish the Chilean sea bass.  The only thing I don't like is that they took the shrimp montage off of the menu and it was amazing!  If its just you and your lady eating dinner save some time and grab a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"I love to go sit at this bar! Also, very yummy food. Anytime I want artery clogging sauces on delicious fish, this is the place."}
{"text":"Very fresh seafood. Been here twice and enjoyed the grilled salmon and fish & chips. Fish had a light but crispy exterior; fries were well seasoned and perfectly fried. Do not recommend the gumbo. It was full of seafood (shrimp, oyster, crab) but I didn't like the overall flavor (although I did enjoy the andouille.) This place is very busy so expect a wait."}
{"text":"There's usually quite a limited menu in terms of fish and fresh food in Phoenix but Pappadeaux is really different. They had an amazing menu, I decided to have some of their crispy fried alligator which was so much better than I thought it would be. I mean alligators don't exactly look tasty, but the restaurant really did an excellent job in cooking it. 

It was absolutely delicious and it is now something I will be completely willing to try again instead of having to be talked into it. The service in the restaurant was alright, the waiters were friendly enough but they weren't that attentive so I did have to wait when making an order. After actually having ordered my food though, it did come out pretty fast. It took about 15 minutes and everything I got was delicious. 

The food was a little overpriced in my opinion but overall it was a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Highly recommend if you love New Orleans style food! Yummy! Jessie and Erin at the bar are the best ever!!!!! First time here and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I went there last Saturday right after my 6 hours intense exam, it's a long drive from Mesa.  The waiter was very nice and helpful, I got seated right away without waiting, it's weekend, so the restaurant was very crowded. I ordered a crawfish platter, which I have been missing for quite a long time and Pappadeaux seems the first decent seafood restaurant I found that serve crawfish.  Both the service and the food were excellent.  I just feel the sauce was a bit spicy for me, should have told waiter to make it less spicy.  I also like the environment outside the restaurant, very pretty view~   I would definitely go back and try some more dishes if I am in Phoenix area next time and feel ok with long drive."}
{"text":"While in the Phoenix area I decided to have dinner here on a friend recommendation. The food is absolutely the best. I had the seafood, sausage gumbo. Absolutely the best. No skimping on the seafood or sausage. The breaded, fried alligator was a little spicy for my wife, but it was great for me. Went back the second nite for dinner.  Wait staff very good, service very good. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Always excellent food as evidenced by the constant crowd. the service typically does a great job; however this visit service was slow and chaotic. I am not going to take away a star for that because everyone has a bad day. worth the visit."}
{"text":"Love this place! From the service to the food you won't be disappointed. The portions are always hearty and delicious. I like the Crawfish Étouffée with dirty rice, YUM!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Devine! Food coma! Great food, so tasty, and awesome service.  I look forward to visiting this restaurant again in the near future!   This place takes the cake!!!"}
{"text":"A solid cajun restaurant.  I really like gumbo - ambrosia for the gods as far as I'm concerned (the gods miraculously don't gain weight from it).  Yes, I've had better gumbo elsewhere, but the gumbo here was quite flavorful and I enjoyed it.  I tend to prefer the creole gumbo which is usually thicker than the cajun gumbo (the gumbo here seemed to be of the thinner cajun variety), but meh, it was still good.  I only ate here for lunch.  So, I got the gumbo with a half po-boy.  The po-boy was also quite good.  I picked the shrimp version.  Could have used more shrimp on the po-boy to fill it out a bit more, but again, not a deal breaker.

Price is tipped on the higher end for my usual standards.  This is expected for any place that serves seafood though.  So, I wasn't surprised.

My server was excellent.  Polite, knowledgeable, prompt.  Can't complain.

Ambience.  Again, can't complain.  Seemed nice, though from what I read, it can get loud at dinner."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, as expected, but the service given by Martha made the experience even better. Very surprised that we were able to get in without the usual 1-2 hour wait."}
{"text":"Chains are usually very predictable, usually on the negative side. However I find Pappadeaux probably from a quality and consistancy standpoint, the very best. I was reminded again today at lunch having a seafood gumbo and half a shrimp po boy which could be a whole sandwich anywhere else. Dinner is also great but can get rather pricey especially for a chain. However despite of that, it's worth going back. Just save your pennies for your next taste treat."}
{"text":"Reliably delicious.  Never had a bad time or a bad meal at Pappadeaux. It can get busy so a reservation is nice but we've never bothered. It's just worth the wait. 

Love : gator bites, gumbo, grits w andouille and fish/seafood dishes."}
{"text":"This is the place in Phoenix to get real, authentic, and delicious southern style seafood.
I've had lunch and dinner here, multiple times, and I have never been disappointed by the quality and quantity of the dishes or drinks. The Blue Point oysters, crayfish, lobsters (I bought a 4+ pounder!), well...
everything. It's all fantastic."}
{"text":"It's the kind of place that I order what I think will be great, and it is, but everyone else seems to have ordered something even better. I walk out thinking, it's a bit more than what I usually want to spend, but I'm glad we went. The kind of place when we wonder where to go for seafood we wind up there.
It seems to have been transplanted, or at least the best replica in Phoenix, of Louisiana when I look at the clientele, who look like transplants from New Orleans looking for a good place to eat. It's lively, and is beautiful building with a red brick courtyard. The staff is knowledgeable, and very helpful to someone raised here and not that familiar with the great variety of seafood. I usually tip larger there than any other place. I've been accused of having moths fly out of my wallet so I have to rate this place very highly. In fact, for seafood I've been here the most often, having been very disappointed with other places in the valley."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I had a horrible experienced! I met him and a friend there for dinner.  They were having a glass of wine in the patio when I got there.  We went inside for dinner.  Angela, the waitress came and asked the guys if they wanted more wine. I had to ask her if I could have a drink!  She came with drinks and we ordered alligator.  Alligator came and no bread, had to ask for it.  Our dinner came, friend was served. We ordered mussels.  The guy tried to pour them out of the pot and they were stuck in the pot!!  Both pots!!!..He said that wasn't good and would get new.  In the mean time Angela came out to tell us she was sorry and asked if we were done with the Alligator (2 left) and she actually had her fingers on them while she was talking to us!!!  I couldn't believe my eyes, also asked if we were done with the bread (with her fingers on the towel the bread was wrapped in).  All this time she was coming out to talk, she sounded  like she was reading from a book or something, slow and not saying anything worth anything. Was also watching people wiping off tables, very slow and really not liking what they were doing.  Get another job!! We have been here a lot and have seen workers fast and doing their job.  Busy and getting things done.  And the food was excellent.  But what has happened?  They should look around and maybe clean house!  The table next to us had a  big serving platter with dirty dishes and left over food next to them thru out their dinner and we had our appetizers next to us thru most of our dinner. The manager finally came out to say she was sorry also, I think it was the kitchen and waitress that was the problems here.  Alligator was very chewy, the mussels were like they were just cooked in water and had no flavor.  We have brought our out of town guests and family here and have always had a wonderful experience, but this time I don't know what went wrong. We will think twice the next time.  I think they are having issues with cooks and workers!!!"}
{"text":"I Luv this place! I am from NOLA...we go many times if we want to take the drive into the city and have never had one bad meal there!  The bread is so good and I have to have the Beefsteak tomato with blue cheese!   The pasta is great and we loved the fried alligator!  We have gone for lunch and dinner many times and have always left full, satisfied, and always brought some home for later!"}
{"text":"I have been to Pappadeaux a couple times, but yesterday for lunch was the most recent.

My dad & bro like to eat lunch early to beat the \"lunch crowd\" so when we got there around 11:15 it was pretty dead, probably only about 10 other parties there. Sounds like a lot but this place is huge inside.

I don't remember her name but our server was a sweet girl & always made sure our glasses were full. And when I couldn't finish my meal she offered to box it up & even threw in an entire loaf of bread, nice!

My dad & bro are one in the same & ordered the blackened catfish with broccoli instead of rice & I ordered the mardi gras pasta. I sampled the catfish & it was delicious, literally melts in your mouth. My pasta dish was very good but also very rich/filling. I ate about a third of it & took the rest home for hubby. He loved it! If it wasn't lunch time & I wasn't so full already, I would have ordered dessert. Their bread pudding & creme brulee are amazing!!

If you have never been to Pappadeaux you must try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Not only is their food delicious, but the infrared sensors on their toilets aren't overly sensitive. I was able to take a prodigious dump there without getting auto flushed a single time."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux has one of the greatest happy hour menus at the bar.  The seafood fondue is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"The most amazing seafood I've ever had! Thanx to Catie we had the perfect first visit and the best experience on our first night in Arizona. She was so incredibly cute, so helpful and so indescribably enthusiastic about her job as a waitress. She knew her wine, and when she wasn't sure, she asked questions and allowed herself to learn from my husband who's a big wine guy. Everything about our entre, main and dessert was perfect and the quality was like no other restaurant have been able to provide us, since we got to LA from Norway two months ago  
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very loud and noisy restaurant, i do not recommend it.I went there December 8th for my birthday dinner it was only 3 of us. it took almost 2 hours to just have  dinner , we hardly saw our waitress she was gone most of the time ,very very very bad service . it ruined my birthday plans for the rest of the evening Way overpriced. I do not see the value in this restaurant. Very loud and noisy restaurant. 2 stars for the spinach dip."}
{"text":"One of my families favorite spots to eat. Love the oysters and the gumbo. Always a good spot for a weekend lunch or dinner. On our top 5 faves!"}
{"text":"We drive by this place every day on the way home from work. One Friday night we decided we would have dinner here. Upon walking in, I absolutely fell in love with the patio. They had music going and the atmosphere was amazing. 

We were seated before the rush kicked in. Our waiter was SO nice! We told him we had never been there and he was very attentive and helpful. He suggested we try to fried alligator for an appetizer, we both hesitated because we had never had alligator. But it was a go big or go home type of night so we decided to try it! Oddly enough we both LOVED It! 

My boyfriend had a fish dish and I had lobster with shrimp dish. I had never ate lobster and did not like it, but that's just my own review of the lobster NOT of the restaurant. We will definitely be going back!

The only downside to it is the price, although for both of us our bill was about $120.00, we will definitely be going back. Next time we may not order as much food though."}
{"text":"I always enjoy visiting this spot while in the Phoenix area. The food is always delicious. It doesn't matter what I order...love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Best seafood I've ever had hands down!! The Mediterranean calamari are the best I've had and I've tried lots of different calamari all over the valley. I will never go to red lobster again it's McDonalds compared to pappadeaux!! The staff is friendly and always knows the menu so well. The Pappas salad is fresh and tossed right in front of you. I dream about their filet and lobster plate!! I've found my favorite seafood restaurant!!"}
{"text":"First off, the don'ts: Don't bother going to this joint on the nights they do they oyster/crawfish specials (I think it's Wednesday and Thursday), it's packed far past the point of unpleasantness. It's just no fun, it ruins the experience, period. I mean, you know, unless you love oysters more than butterflies and rainbows and sex, in which case, knock yourself out I guess. I'd rather drive to the nearest ocean, pluck oysters out of it myself, take them home, spend a month learning how to prepare them properly and then make and serve them to myself than go to this stupid place when it's packed. Also, don't order the gumbo. It was awful.

That's really all I have bad to say about the food I have had at Pappadeaux. Everything else has been just wonderful. I had the whitefish dinner with lemon butter and capers, my wife had the shrimp and lobster platter (I can't remember their fancy Cajun names). We shared the appetizer plate that had calamari and alligator tail meat, among other things - all of it was truly stupidly delicious. Their calamari preparation (and sauce) is the best I've had in my life, and that's saying something.

So why the three stars, you might be asking, instead of four? Well frankly, it's just too expensive. It's obvious they've got hella overhead, the place is truly beautifully decorated, but you know what? I don't like paying for overhead, and there, I said it. I like paying for air conditioning and good food. I don't care if you've got one of every species of edible fish mounted to your beautifully laquered ornate wood trim or not, I really don't. If there are two of you and you are having a couple of drinks, it's difficult to walk out of this place for less than a benjamin and I frankly just think that's too much. We're not being served gold leafed fois gras and caviar here. This is especially so considering the portion sizes, which are not as criminal as Fish Market used to be, but are still not exactly a feast. In addition, the waitstaff is sub-par. I've said it before and I'll say it again, when I'm laying down this kind of jack, I don't expect to have to flag my waiter down like it's the last lap at Nascar. All that having been said, if you're craving good seafood and have the money and patience and can get a seat without waiting for an hour, Pappadeax is about as good as it gets in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting Phoenix and because I am a lover of this style of cuisine, I had to come here. We had a party of six and the place was packed! We didn't have a long wait under 5 minutes on a Friday night. We were seated right away and our server Mia was fantastic. Her recommendations were right on and her timing was impeccable. We started with the Fried Alligator appetizers and had the lobster pot, another lobster dish shrimp and the crawfish ettoufe and another seafood platter. All was fantastic with above average portion size.  no one left hungry as we didn't have any room for dessert."}
{"text":"Very good food, I didn't actually enjoy waiting so long. But not there waiters fault. Good was great, service great. But because of then wait i'am giving it a 4 instead of 5. The salmon was excellent a must have. Also the appetizer crab cake was out of this world."}
{"text":"I deliberated over where to celebrate my birthday dinner and I knew seafood was in order. Especially with the limited fresh options in Phoenix, Pappadeaux's was calling my name. I'd been here once before and really enjoyed it and appreciate how flavorful the creole-inspired dishes are!

We had the crispy fried alligator and shrimp and crawfish fondeaux to start. After living on the Gulf Coast, the alligator was not a \"shock\" to me as it is to some people and it was fun and tasty. The fondeaux was rich and yummy! 

A brief flashback to my first Pappadeaux experience reminded me not to fill up too much on apps, since I ended up taking up most of my entree home. I did not listen to that little voice. We ordered our entrees -- Gulf Coast Redfish Pontchartrain for me and Pasta Mardi Gras for him -- including a cup of gumbo. Our friends ordered their entrees too, including the lobster bisque (YUM! The gumbo was good, but the bisque was GREAT!). 

Sure enough...by the time our entrees arrived, I was full again!! Fail for me, because the food was all soooo very tasty! The waitress was amazing and willing to box everything up for us. 

And the cherry on top?  Well, Pappadeaux's has a mean birthday brownie a la mode that was HUGE and delicious! Needless to say, I've got enough food for 2 days...

I definitely am a fan of this place, especially among Phoenix seafood options...and though there seems to always be a wait, the courtyard is lovely to hang out in while you wait for a table."}
{"text":"Food was 5 stars, manager was 2 stars. Being from Texas, I love Pappadeaux and we come here on a regular basis. Food was great, as usual, but the food service time was awful as they seemed to have lost our order (sat in the bar, which is normally great). Our oysters came timely but we sat for 35-40 min. after that to get our food.  Saw the bartender talk to one manager and she went to the kitchen to make things happen. After we ate, no consideration for the delay.  I asked to speak with the manager and a different one came up.  She apologized and said they didn't expect to be so busy (really, on Saturday?) and that the bartender was new. No real concern or consideration. Then asked if I would be back next Saturday(!). Hoping for a better experience next time."}
{"text":"This location (Phoenix) was having kitchen issues that night, but the manager came by and apologized and took items off our bill. Food was good. Service has never been an issue at other locations I've visited (Houston, Chicago, Atlanta)"}
{"text":"My favorite place for fish.  Great service, excellent food.  Consistent quality across all the locations I've been to (Houston, Dallas, Albuquerque and now Phoenix)."}
{"text":"New Year's EVE - we arrived @ 4 PM.    The waitress was a fly we wanted to get rid of.   It made the dinner most unpleasant.  I understand they want to turn the tables - but don't be a gnat.   Several times we ignored her.   

The clam chowder hadn't been cooked enough.  The potatoes were not cooked.  It seemed like they had been added as an after thought.  

The short well drink of gin/tonic came to almost $7 a piece.   REALLY?
On New Year's I always give a 50% tip.   Not this year.   It was quite disappointing - from several servers outside smoking to the icky waitress.    TOO BAD!"}
{"text":"Last night, we again experienced Pappadeaux excellent food!  Because we eat out 3 times a week and have dined here many times before, I feel qualified to review accurately and honestly.
1. Caesar salad dressing is much improved.  It frequently  has been too bitter to enjoy.  I believe that the kitchen preps, reamed out too much of the inside whites of the lemons, which is very bitter.  (juice and zest are not, but the white membrane is very bitter)
Why not add (more?) anchovy paste?  That is TRUE Caesar and as a high-end seafood specialty restaurant...you need \"Authentic Caesar\" with anchovy! Thank you for little or no vinegar!
2. Excelent Reisling wine.  However, Margherita on the rocks was so bitter, my man could not enjoy it and didn't order a second one. Tart is good, bitter is miserable.
3. Pappadeaux always has the BEST  Halibut in town!  Rivals the best we have had in Seattle, where it is the freshest. You manage to keep it moist without under-cooking. 
The crab topping however was in very short supply last night!  You have skimped on it and we don't appreciate that on a $37. Entree!
4. Salmon topped with crab was also excellent...rivals our many meals in Washington state...again,  short supply of crab on top for a second $37. Entree.
5. Vegies were fine.
6.  Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside French bread was consistently good.
 
Of course, we will return.  Glad to see the improvements in the salad you made and hoping for anchovies in future.  Happy about the wine, entrees excellent.  Work on the other issues mentioned above...
All-in-all....excellent fare!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!!! Alaskan King crab and oysters are amazing. ALL the good there is amazing, especially the butter they give you with their bread!! Nick, he works at the bar, he's always friendly and knowledgeable about the food. He's a good guy. Also Jose, he chucks oysters at the bar, he's the man. This place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place changed my wife's views about seafood. When we first met she was not a big fan of seafood till Pappadeux took her mind to a new dimension. 

Must try items

* Seafood Gumbo
* Shrimp Etouffee With white rice
* Atlantic Salmon Yvette
* Tilapia Lafayette

Pappadeux is a winning at all times wish there was more locations in phoenix"}
{"text":"Appetizer: Fried alligator (tastes like chicken) and crabcakes were great. 
Main: Crawfish etouffee and Caribbean lobster tail - good portions, great taste! The etouffee was definitely my favorite!!!

Dessert: Portions are HUGE! Went with the dessert trio, and all three items were good :-)

Service: had a long wait on a popular night (around Valentine's day weekend), but this is to be expected. Seated and had decent service from our water. Place is busy and noisy! Very enjoyable night out with friends!"}
{"text":"Returned after was contacted about post .. this time I had a good waitress and the food was great . I ent at lunch time and it was slow no waiting and great lunch specials .. 
I will be returning .. 
The voo doo drink was BOMB .."}
{"text":"Now I'm not a huge seafood fan so coming here at first I was totally not feeling it. I didn't want to spoil the night for everyone else so i made due. I ended up ordering the Mahi fish with rice.....It was freakin ridiculously good. The seasoning and flavor was so intense in a good way. I really didn't want the meal to end. I am a fan now, hope to cone here again!"}
{"text":"Had the Atlantic Salmon Alexander. My wife and I shared the larger 11oz portion and took home leftovers. This was one of, if not the Best meal we've had there. Scallops, crawfish, shrimp, blackened salmon covered in a white wine sauce. I'm cheap but considered this to be worth the $32. Nearly a perfect meal."}
{"text":"Best cajun food outside of Louisiana, without question. I could eat their crawfish etouffee every day for the rest of my life and die a happy man"}
{"text":"Located just off Highway 17, this Pappadeaux's never fails to deliver when I am in town. 

Always pleasant staff, I have eaten here in passing for a drink and snack at the bar, for lunch, as well as for dinner. Never a bad experience. 

A must have is the Deep Fried Alligator appetizer. Very appetizing and tasty, no off or gamey flavor at all. 

Also, the cheese sticks here are the best I have ever had, more like cheese logs. These have the lightest and crispiest fried crust you will ever have. 

Other dishes to try are the Crawfish Étouffée as well as the Pasta Mardi Gras. 

The only downside at this location is that it can get a little noisy when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Love...love...LOVE this place. And I think I'm hearing life music, what a treat. The fried alligator is the most."}
{"text":"We had a great time there. We went with our kids and it's a great place to get great food where it's not so formal, so if we are a bit loud it wasn't a problem at all. We arrived at a busy time (on a Tuesday night the place was packed - good sign) and had to wait for our food a bit, but the manager came and talked to us to apologize and offer us free deserts. Service in general was great, our waitress was attentive at all times and everyone is nice and smiling. Great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This in truth had been my first \"Cajun\" eats.

The atmosphere was cool.
The service was good.
The food was rich and filling."}
{"text":"Great stick to your bones food.  Try the fried crab claws and fried gator. The service is spotty however, the food is great."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Pappadeaux.  We come to this place a few times a year.  We've had almost every item on the appetizer list, and quite a few from their main dishes.  Great place to dine.  Their servers and service are also top quality."}
{"text":"My wife exclaimed the tilapia was the best fish she ever had. Flown in fresh daily. I loved the Scallops cooked in brown butter and blackened Louisana style. A perfect combination of texture and taste. Try the coconut shrimp appetizer. We were debating between the crab cakes and coconut shrimp. The waiter recommended the shrimp and said Pappadeaux's is known for their coconut shrimp. I now know why. So delicious. I highly recommend. It was worth the drive from Gilbert to Sunnyslope."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot in Phoenix. The portions are always plentiful, and the quality of the food is outstanding. I enjoyed the chopped salad with crawfish today, and it was so good. Although not the cheapest in town, I challenge you to find quality and portion size with anyone else. I encourage everyone to dine at this restaurant, you will never be disappointed. The waitstaff is incredible, attentive, and informative. I feel they add to the dining experience. GREAT FOOD!"}
{"text":"OMG I Love this place! The Calamari was super fresh! And the lemon aioli sauce was so refreshing, it was an explosion of flavors! My husband ordered the steamed muscles and was completely satisfied! They were cooked to perfection and were soooo fresh! I ordered the Main Lobster and it was freaken HUGE! It was definitely more than I expected! Oh and did I mention their oysters were on sale that night? They were like $8.00 a dozen and fresh and so tasty! Our server was so polite and very knowledgeable about the menu. 
The price was a little steep but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place with a large variety of menu choices from alligator, crab, lobster, pastas, and steaks.  The banana pudding is a must have for dessert.  A bit pricey, expect to spend over $50 for a dinner for two.  Has a nice outdoor seating area and offers a full bar."}
{"text":"I love happy hour at Pappadeaux, $5 Grey Goose cocktails and great appetizers.   Try the Grey Goose with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, so refreshing!   Order the oysters when in season and ask for blackened alligator, which is so good.   It's not usually on the menu, but they will make it.   I prefer it to fried alligator.   The cold boiled shrimp are to die for."}
{"text":"You don't have to love Cajun food to love Pappadeaux!  They have fantastic seafood and there's something good for everyone. From the apps to the desserts, everything is delicious!  And their cocktails are fantastic!!  Great, friendly service too!"}
{"text":"This is my hubby's go to place for seafood.  Love the fresh oysters and fish. Service for the most part is pretty good...it can be spotty in the dining room.  Food is consistently great every time."}
{"text":"One would think this place would be jam packed during lunch with the quality of service and food it has! But it wasn't and that was good for me...I got extraordinary attentive service by a young lady, by the name of Kayla, who is very knowledgable of the menu. I normally base service on how often they fill my water glass since I drink a lot of it and in the 35 minutes I was there she topped it off a good 3 times. 

Now to the nitty gritty...I'm normally not a sandwich person but I like to try multiple things when I go to a restaurant for the first time. For an appetizer I ordered a half fried calamari and a lunch combo of a catfish po boy sandwich and a bowl of crawfish bisque. She asked if I wanted everything at once and I did since I had to get back to work. 

Food came out quick, hot and delicious. Calamari didn't need the cocktail sauce or the lemon aioli it came with. I thought the aioli was a tad strong for the calamari but still good favor. I'm not a big fan or pickles on a sandwich but I figured if I'm gonna try it for the first time I might as well see what the complete sandwich is like and it was great. Crawfish bisque was buttery and flavorful. And last but not least...banana pudding!! I took dessert to go and it damn near put me in an food coma it was so good. 

Strongly recommended!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and his friends are huge fans and they took me there 2 days ago for dinner.

Disappointed, I would say.  To me, it is just another Cheesecake Factory restaurant NOT in terms of food portion but the style: noisy, dark, crowded.

For those of you who have never been to Pappadeaux, I still think you should go experience.  Try especially the dirty rice.  Would I go back?  Probably not.   I just hate talking to people by yelling and being not able to see the food clearly."}
{"text":"I never use the \"to-die-for\" phrase because I would only die for my kids, but if you come to Pappadeaux' you will likely taste a bite of what I would imagine you would find in heaven (if there is one)! We had the alligator appetizer- medium, a caeser salad, Pasta Mardi Gras, Costa Rican Mahi Alexander, Arnold Palmers, and a Purple Voodoo. The alligator (my first time trying it) was cooked perfectly. Squeeze lemon on it- try the sauce it is accompanied with, or eat it as is. It is great! The seafood (mahi, shrimp, crawfish, scallops) in both dishes was cooked/grilled to perfection and the portions were more than a person can consume at one sitting. The Mahi Alexander sauce pulled everything together for me and was even a compliment to the already delicious dirty rice! You cannot see the Mahi under the crawfish, shrimp and sauce, but it was a huge 7oz portion. As far as the staff, our server, Jaclyn, added so much to our experience. She made excellent recommendations and added wit and humor to our experience. It might be hours from LA, but this will definitely be a road-trip worthy meal!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best seafood in Phoenix. I've never had a bad bite in the 5-10 times I've been to this location. I'd recommend the mahi-mahi with pontratrain sauce; it's amazing! Other favorites include the crawfish etoufee and bisque as well as the seafood gumbo. You really can't go wrong on this menu. For dessert, the banana pudding and the creme brulee are quite good."}
{"text":"Whenever you want awesome service and amazing food you come here!!! Seriously I carve this place everyday. I eat out a lot and I promise you can not miss with these guys! Food is amazing and the restaurant its a fun, loud, classy, sassy experience!!food for the whole family! Tons of flavors. They really know how to serve you! Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to Pappadeaux. The service is pretty good, and the food is excellent. They have alligator for an appetizer which is very tasty. I love ordering the gumbo and the lobster bisque for starters. As for the main course, The Mardi Gras pasta is very delicious. This place can be a bit expensive but if you love seafood this place is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing from the atmosphere, menu choices, quality of food, to the service. Lisa our server was knowledgeable, friendly, efficient and just beyond amazing. It is pricey but you get what you pay for. Everything is made in house and you can taste it. Seafood is flown in fresh."}
{"text":"Very poor service.  Went in for late afternoon lunch (3:00) and the restaurant was less than half full but looked like a good number of servers working.  We were sat at a table and there we sat for 10 minutes without ever being acknowledged by any of the servers that walked by our table - after 10 min we walked out.   Good service isn't hard people - it's not rocket science."}
{"text":"My favorite place for great seafood. My husband and I shared a shrimp cocktail which had jumbo shrimp with a wonderful texture and great cocktail sauce with fresh horseradish. Crawfish platter in a medium size was too much for me to finish. Blackened catfish was perfectly cooked. Hubby enjoyed bread pudding for dessert. All desserts are huge. Prices are high but worth it for quality. Service also great. The down side of this place is the noise level. But for the noise I would have rated 5 stars."}
{"text":"amazing food and  good drinks! Service was incredible! Definitely try the gator! and Sea bass!"}
{"text":"I love this place! No other seafood restaurant can compare to Pappadeaux. The best Alaskan King Crab-legs you will ever find!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great service.  Great food.  Great relaxed atmosphere.  Andy, our server, was awesome.  Very polite, fun and extremely attentive but not at all intrusive.  We were greeted by at least 4 different employees on the way to our table; as well as being wished a good evening by 3 or 4 on our way out.  He gave us a free order of Aligator since it was our first time there.  Everyone loved it!  Only my 16 y/o son was not impressed with the food; although it was his first time trying anything \"blackened.\"  The service manager (I think his name was Malcomb or Matt) came over and comp'd us a desert  for my wife's birthday.  The price was about what we expected for great seafood, but the quality of food and service was worth DOUBLE what we paid."}
{"text":"Great food, but the 1hr wait for a patio table ruined it (while there were a few open tables out there)."}
{"text":"We came up to Phoenix last evening to attend the Amy Grant and Michael W Smith Christmas concert at Grand Canyo University Arena.  We always make a point of eating at Pappadeaux's Seafood Kitchen when we can.  We were running behind. 

Lisa the manager and our server, Lexie pulled off a miracle and got us drinks and food in record time.  They displayed unflappable hospitality and friendliness. They did not have to.  It was our fault that we had not allowed appropriate time to not be rushed.  

We live in Tucson and would love to have a Pappadeaux's in Tucson but until then, we will always come back.  

God bless you for running a top shelf establishment. Lexie and Lisa certainly deserve more recognition than the tip we left. 

Happy Thanksgiving and Merry Christmas.

{"text":"Great place to have a great meal, however if you dont like long delays to het in I recommend dining on off peak days or hours as this place is super popular on the weekend evenings.  Everything is super good wait staff is great!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome tonight. Although they over cook my filet mignon, they gave me another hole order to make up. Thank you"}
{"text":"This restaurant never fails to amaze me with the food and service! My boyfriend and I had a great dinner here. We sat at the bar first since the wait was so long. The bar tender was very assertive and even delivered out oysters to our table once we got one. I forgot his name, maybe Trent? He wore glasses. Then our server Ariel was just great!! She was extremely sweet and attentive. Request Ariel if you're there on a Friday night!! Oysters were on promotion for 10 bucks a dozen. We had no clue so it was a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Yummy seafood appetizers.
Large varieties of dishes had the salmon special and enjoyed it. A bit on the pricey side so nice treat to yourself and family."}
{"text":"Never been here before...never even heard of them actually, until this recent biz trip down to Phoenix.  For being a \"chain\" restaurant, boy were they good!  Everything tasted extremely fresh and the quality of the seafood was wonderful.   I was accompanied by two of my co-workers with all very different palates.  We each ordered something extremely different from the other and all you heard was the sound of us chowing down.  One colleague got a salad which she devoured...said it was fresh, not too little/much dressing, etc.  My other colleague ordered the crab legs and she loved every last bite...tore it all up.  I ordered a tuna dinner item...don't remember the name...but it was a special item they had that evening and it was divine.  The mashed potatoes were so fluffy...loved it all.  I also ordered the banana pudding for dessert and was a complete pig...and ooooMG was it worth it.  It was layered so well and served in a keepsake mason jar...very cute.  Anyhow, it beat my mom's banana pudding which is one of the many foods I would eat before death...!  SO, I couldn't believe how delicious everything was.  Additionally, the service was SUPER prompt and the young woman who was our server was extremely courteous and efficient.  Would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Love this place, both food and atmosphere. They are usually busy at least when we go in the evening. But the wait is reasonable and the atmosphere makes the wait easier. 

I am a fan of their dirty rice. And their wrapped shrimp. I have also had a halibut there that to this day is the best I have ever had. It was one of the specials one of the evenings there. 

What makes this place great is not just their spices, but the tenderness of the way they cook their seafood. 

Service excellent each time."}
{"text":"Best place to go eat on a special occasions fried gator everyone needs to try it so delicious"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service!! Took a client over for lunch (large group of 20 people) and we loved the experience..."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux. What can I say? You are DELICIOUS! 
Our waitress was probably the best waitress I've ever had. Carrie was enthusiastic, really attentive without being overbearing or annoying, and just overall super awesome. 
We came in for lunch around 1 p.m. (their lunch is until 3), and I ordered the sampler platter, but I don't really like tilapia, so I asked if I could get some calamari instead of tilapia - done, without a hassle. Mum got the crawfish lunch. The bread they bring out is amazing, by the way.
Our food was out in probably ten minutes. Not only did I have an abnormally huge portion of calamari on my plate, but our waitress brought me out all the sauces that go with the calamari - their spicy marinara and a lemon aioli that you will stare at for several minutes and wonder how an aioli can taste that good. Yup. Several minutes.
Our waitress checked in on us often, and when we were done, boxed up our meal for us while we got our check. 
It was really hot out, and I was dreading walking to the car to sit on sizzling black leather seats, and before I know it BAM! There is a take-out cup for each of us, filled with our respective drink choice, our food bagged up and extra sauce for my leftoevers in little plastic take-out cups... Has anyone ever seen such awesome service?
If you go... you better ask for Carrie. If you don't, you will be incredibly and horribly jealous that you did not get the best waitress I have ever SEEN."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go! They have got a large variety. I love their oysters I really enjoy the atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Love... Love... Love!! After my long flight back to the Arizona desert, I was excited to try their frog and alligator - extremely delicious.  Next time, I will try the frog and alligator legit, no frying and no bread crumbs to change their natural flavor.  

Oysters are soo yummy.  I automatically taste the ocean, which I miss dearly.  

Definitely recommend and don't be scared to try the unusual!!"}
{"text":"We have had several terrific meals at Pappadeaux's, I enjoy the crawfish étouffée.  My wife likes the Salmon, and we normally order the blue point Oysters on the half shell, very tasty."}
{"text":"I am always happy when I can enjoy fresh seafood in the valley of the sun.  After all, this is Phoenix, Arizona. My family and I went to Papadeux Restuarant during the                                                                             holiday season.  I had a pleasant experience. So,here is a brief review.  The restuarant is decorated in a French Quarter New Orleans Louisiana style. The menu had many entrees to choose from. Our seafood dinners were delicious so were the appetizers and the desserts. The customer service was professional and staff was friendly.  I enjoyed it and will go back."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday and I loved it! Great atmosphere and excellent cocktails. I had the Costa Rican Mahi Alexander and it was delicious! Will definitely recommend and come back again when I return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"First heard of this restaurant in Houston a few weeks ago.  Absolutely perfect.  Almost too good.  Found out there was one in Phoenix, AZ, where I live.  Tried it, expecting it not to be as good, since the Gulf is well known for its seafood, and Phoenix is not.  We received the exact level of quality in food and service.  Highly recommend this Restaurant

Have been back several times, and all have been fantastic until last Sunday. Waitress was obviously new, but without trainer.  Spoke very broken English and I knew she wasn't understanding order.  My wife ordered soup for app and crab and lobster salad for lunch.  I ordered one crab cake for app and pan seared talapia for lunch.  Even pointed to the dinner item so she wouldn't mix it up with what my mother in law ordered, which was the lunch grilled talapia.  Totally different dish.  First my crab cake came out.  10 min later my wife's salad came out.  I asked about her soup.  Waitress replied that she wasn't sure which she wanted first so she guessed.  2 minutes later the soup and our lunches came out.  I received the wrong lunch, as I expected.  She asked me if I wanted to change it.  Didn't feel like waiting, so I ate just the fish, but none of the sides.  The waitress just asked how everything was, even though my plate was barely touched.  She should have noticed, and not just smiled and took my plate.  At minimal, she should have sent the manager over to talk to us.  Figured she just wanted to cover her mistakes.  I am 3rd on regular check in's, so we will continue to come back.  Service was definitely not up to their norm.  Was not very busy at the time, so she was not rushed.

Just grabbed a to go order. Very efficient and super friendly. Heard that they were rolling out new training for take out. Everyone was enthused and seemed happy to be there. Thanks Pappa!"}
{"text":"The fact that the tilapia was the best tilapia I ever had. And the crab cake with fresh crab sprinkled with lobster chunks. My bf got the salmon that was about a foot long covered in scallops and scrimps definitely coming again and again and again lol. Tons of leftovers"}
{"text":"We went there on Saturday, and it was\" very\" busy, not just cause it was a Saturday, but the Saturday before Mothers Day. However our experience was awesome. We sat at the bar, and well gotta send a \"shout out\" to Jemma, who was not our waitress, but was delivering food to the bar. She took time to tell us what each dish was as this was our first time there. She was Awesome! And our two bartenders who took care of us Nick and Missy, hooked us up on the lump crab & spinach dish which was amazing. The food here was very good, and these three persons great service will definitely bring us back!!"}
{"text":"If you love oyster then this is the place. Jose has been with this restaurant from opening day. He is an oyster expert. Stop in and  experience heaven with on the half shell.  Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried out this place for lunch with my family. Ordered the lobster and shrimp salad + small clam chowder soup. For $22 salad, I was expecting a lot more meat. Sadly, it only came with a few bite size lobster and couple shrimps. Clam chowder was good, but bit on the salty side. 
We were given free toasted bread with butter. Bread was delicious! The place has a beautiful outdoor patio and our waiter Blake was excellent. 

They also had a secret crawfish plate that was done upon request. Best crawfish I ever eaten. Extremely fresh. Try that out next time if you're a fan of crawfish. 

Other than the high prices, this place was good."}
{"text":"I went to Pappadeux a few years ago and it was fantastic. The place was nicely appointed, the service was great as was the food and it was worth the price. Recently my husband and I decided to go there for lunch for our anniversary and were disgusted by the negative experience we had there. The place looks more like a cheap Vegas cafeteria now, the carpet is filthy, the silverware was dirty and the service was horrible! Our waitress seated us directly next to the only other people in the place which was ridiculous since the entire restaurant was wide open. The waiter waiting on that table was bringing them bread and going over the menu with them, ours did none of those things. We ordered the fried alligator appetizer which was over seasoned and chewy and when our lunch came it was clear that the catfish my husband ordered had come straight from a bag of frozen fish. The fact that the sauce and butter are served in paper cups at $20 a plate was unreal. The food was cafeteria quality at best my food was inedible. The waitress was rude so I finally asked for the manager who came over made excuses and finally comped the meal. It was a complete waste of time and we both left hungry. I don't know what happened to that place but it has become a terrible restaurant and we will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"This place is exceptional! Food is delicious and drinks are scrumptious. Great staff too! Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"So tasty. Food is the best as far a seafood goes in the state. Drinks are nice as well and staff always has a great attitude"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed my dining experience here and occasionally have business meetings over lunch. The service has always been friendly and treated me professionally and their manager took care of me when they made a mistake. If you like seafood and don't mind paying a little more you will enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"The staff was first rate here, from host staff, to bartenders and servers. I had a chance to watch them for a long time, as I was \"vulturing\" on one of the outdoor balcony tables: there are three, and they are offered on a first-come-first-served basis. The patio seating was devoted to private functions on the two nights we dined here, and we really wanted outdoor tables, because I have a shellfish allergy and wanted to be in the open air. The reason I mention a food allergy is because of the highly professional and dedicated approach the staff uses to ensure an excellent and safe guest experience. After telling my server, the manager actually came to the table and the manager has to basically be in the loop on the order, which is amazing. The food was great and our experience was delightful. Hats off to this place!"}
{"text":"Very nice environment. Prices a little spendy but the experience is well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best seafood in Arizona, this is why it gets 5 stars. However, it is a bit pricey on the food. But Pappadeaux also has some seasonal specials that make up for that. Like 50 cents an oyster. I could spend all day there at that price. Also they have a great happy hour both on drinks and food.

Its a great atmosphere also with great service. They offer a variety of mixed drinks that are superb. I recommend the sweet tea and the swamp thing.

Also don't forget to try the crispy fried alligator ;)"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal with copious amounts of fresh seafood seasoned perfectly. The bread is excellent. I'd recommend staying away from the gumbo...it's not terrible, it's just not necessary. The Mixed Seafood Grill and the risotto were great. Our server, Annie was efficient & helpful without being intrusive. This was a great end to an excellent day in the Arizona sun."}
{"text":"Love the Pappadeuax delux platter.  Enough food to feed two easily with extra to take home...great value!  Love the environment, and the desserts are awesome!"}
{"text":"We gave this place a try for the first time. I expected more delicious food or maybe we're just not seafood people. I had the Moroccan salmon; it was a little soggy for my taste. My hubby ordered steak and said it's better at Texas Roadhouse for less the price. The calamari is really good though and the dip that comes along with it but overall we most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"YUM!!! Worth the wait if you do not have reservations. The food is delicious and the drinks are very good!
I had a Purple Voodoo drink

Apps: Shrimp cocktail, Calamari, and bodain A+

Meals: Salmon with Maine Lobster was good BUT kinda deceiving it came without a lobster tail it was just a FEW (4) LITTLE chunks of lobster.   (This was why I only gave 4 stars)

The Cheesey grits are so good and so is the crabcakes! The dirty rice is to die for!!
 We shared Key lime Pie and banana pudding
 My husband left his credit card so he ate their a 2nd night and LOVED the food so much we will be going at least 1x month"}
{"text":"Waitress spilled ice cold water on me in first 5 minutes. Drinks from bar were really bad. Had to send the first back. Second still was not good. Took her 10 minutes to make the Greek salads at the table while the other guests food got cold. Bad experience overall. This was Monday."}
{"text":"Some of the best grits you can find at a restaurant, this was our first time here and it was amazing.
The only thing better than the food was our waiter Nick, he took very good care of us and insured that I will return whenever I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Awesome love to be full and have left overs great place love it here."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux is our go to spot to celebrate special occasions or with friends in from out of town. the food is always excellent, as is the service. Megan, on of the managers, knows us on site and always swings by to greet us."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate a birthday. We got the appetizer's and the drinks fairly quickly, but the bread took an extra 5 minutes to show up. We got the Fried Alligator, and it was delicious. I ordered the seafood gumbo, but the restaurant was out of oysters so it had extra shrimp. I felt like the Gumbo wasn't as good as others I have tried. I also tried fried Crawfish tails, and they were delicious. For desert I had the Creme brulee. Overall the service and food was great, but I was disappointed by the Gumbo."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour deals but ooohweee it gets crowed :) food yummy"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for a late lunch around 1:30. Place was much busier than we would have guessed but were seated immediately. Server seemed busy and took awhile to get our drink orders. Since we had been seated for a time we ordered our entree at the same time.  Appetizer came before the drinks and shortly after manager came by and explained that they had to change out the CO2 and it would be a few minutes. Entrees came before drinks and when drinks finally came we said we didn't want them. When server came back to check and apologize for the late drinks I told her 25 minutes was unacceptable. She was very rude saying she was busy.  Manager came later, we told her what happened and to our surprise she bought our lunch. In addition gave us a gift card. What a great place!  (By the way, food was awesome as usual)"}
{"text":"We had a large party here;  the service was impeccable, the food was delicious & the atmosphere is delightful!"}
{"text":"Pappadeaux is over the 5 start rating.  It was the first time there.  The photos do not do the place justice as it is so much better in person.  Lucky to be seated away from the bar area to avoid the noise.  Very accommodating as asked to be seated at a bit larger table that was available.  There was a number in our group.  I'm more about the food and could care less about the settings, not so here.  From the minute you are in the parking lot you feel like you are mentally taken away and transported to somewhere else.  Never been to New Orleans but, the other guest said it was very nice.  So, from the minute you get out of your car take the time to look around. Enjoy the settings from your car and including up to your table.  Glad to be seated away from the bar area noise.  The inside was nice as the lighting was just right as not to be to dark or to light.  I like to see what I'm eating and enjoy it, perfect lighting. Staff was helpful and nice.  We all got the Pappadeax Platter. We were told it is a lot of food and I thought, ya sure I'll see.  It was and had some to go home and I'm ok with that!  Enjoy it a bit longer.  The food was very good and was fresh, even the next day ... what I took home.  We all were to full for any desert and then saw some of deserts pass by to the next table, we're drooling at the site.  Just to full so, we plan on going back before dinner crowd just for desert. For a special night out it is a winner.  It is a relax place without the stuffy attitude that some places have."}
{"text":"Food is so tasty and plentiful! I think I had a Mardi Gras platter for dinner and breakfast AND lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I do not understand why a recipe gets changed after years of proven success.  I love Pappadeaux's - but why change the PO Boy recipe?  I was in Houston for business & thought how lucky to be getting a Po Boy from Pappadeaux's.  I did not read the menu as I knew ahead of time what I was going to get, but to my surprise it was different.  Instead of Remoulade Sauce, it now comes with Tartar & Cocktail sauce and pickle slices??? Not so good anymore...planning a trip to Phx in August, want Po-Boys...but not with the new recipe."}
{"text":"We meet up at Pappadeaux for an early dinner Thursday night. We get together about every six  weeks and have a nice dinner, laughs, and catch up. First of all I want to say our waitress was great. The three of us ordered Pasta Mardi Gras. I was so disappointed. I got a bowl of pasta with pink sauce and a couple of tasteless shrimp. Then I saw the waitress bring the next table a plate of onion rings. I called her over, please bring us a plate of onion rings, she did and they were amazing. The onion ring were about $6 and Pasta Mardi Gras was $18. I brought the Pasta Mardi Gras home so I could really look at it. All that was in the bowl was pasta, mushrooms and pink sauce. There was no craw-fish in the pink sauce.What a rip off. Then to top it off, we were sitting in a booth we had people coming up to us asking if we were done because they wanted our booth. For goodness' sake people we are still eating. So, Rude! and the management just watch what was going on and did nothing about it. If you were thinking about stopping in, just skip it, it's not the good food it once was and the management sucks."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch there ... The mussels by far were the best ever!
Service was great .. a bit noisy even at lunch but I'll take it."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux is an old favorite of mine.... good menu and good prices and good service.... my last visit was no different... Jane our waitress was perfect! knew her menu and was able to guide us through our choices... will be going back!"}
{"text":"First off - the food is freaking incredible!!  Secondly, Daphne (our server) is the sweetest and most helpful gal on the planet.  We were on a quick lunch before we hopped on a plane and I just wanted a salad - she recommended the chopped salad and holy cow!!!  It wasn't just an average salad.  Super fresh, hot juicy grilled chicken - YUM!  Best service!! Third - the spicy Bloody Mary is to DIE.  Ask for Amanda at the bar - she's legit!  Your welcome. ;)"}
{"text":"Too expensive, more than red lobster, and red lobster is good. We went knowing that this place was well known, however way to greasy, small portions, and we kept smelling fish that smelled expired. We tried it and my party of 4 all got sick. We were told that when fish smells too fishy it usually means it's bad or old. Plus our waitress continued to come to our table to inform us that the bartender was too busy and our child's milk would be out as soon as it could. \"What did you have to milk the cow out back\"..... come on the place is always busy , hire more support."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux is definitely my favorite restaurant.  The food is to die for! Cajun deliciousness and fresh seafood!  Who could resist?

Things to definitely try:

Oyster & Shrimp Fondue
Mediterranean Calamari
Shrimp Brochette
Pasta Mardi Gras
Crawfish Bisque
Mussels
Blackened Opelousas
Desserts?  Where do I begin???  Sweet potato pecan pie ala mode, carrot cake cheesecake, creme brulee, bread pudding, banana pudding, all are good!  The list goes on. 

They also have yummy cocktails, including the famous Swamp Thing.  It's a fru fru girlie's drink and pretty sweet and potent.  If you like that sort of thing give it a go!

Things to note:

If you are on a diet forget it, there is nothing lite on the menu. 

They have a happy hour M-F and a live band on the patio on Friday/Saturday.  

The service is almost always good and the interior is warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Becoming one of my favorites- this is the Ruth's Chris of seafood / Cajun!  So many menu options make every picky diner take 20 minutes to decide what to order.

My boyfriend and I have taken his grandma here as well as my mom and I having dinner here on a different occasion.  The prices aren't cheap but either is the experience.  I'd say the only downside is it can get very loud at peak dinner times.

Every time we get a helpful server with an a+ attitude trying to make their guests enjoy their experience. 

When we waited for a table at the bar with my bf and his gma- the bartender had the people's appetizer upgraded next to us so we could have some too!

I also love their margaritas and New Orleans inspired drink menu here- always starting the party with a frozen margarita or mai tai!

I enjoyed the Moroccan salmon and also had the naked salmon previously.  The kitchen has a tendency to serve broccoli raab with the naked salmon instead of green beans like the menu lists.  Broccoli raab is so gross and I do not recommend it!

Lastly the dessert tray is the real reason for my review!! Old school offerings on a tray always entices! Last time we had the pecan praline cheesecake (seasonal?) which is the most delicious thing ever."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great dinner and dining experience! We ordered the shrimp and crawfish fondeaux appetizer (which came with an awesome garlic bread loaf), Chilean sea bass (topped with jumbo lump \"crab gratin\"), and crispy Atlantic salmon (seared, topped with crab, shrimp & scallop), a cup of andouille gumbo, and finished with a house-recipe key lime pie.  Every dish was excellent, and the fondeaux lived up to all the Yelp hype. All of these items were at the recommendation of our young but very knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and attentive server, Tory (you were awesome Tory and thanks for all the great recommendations). Our only regret is that it's taken us so long to finally try this place. We've passed it a thousand times, never realizing it had so much quality food and ambience (New Orleans flare). It's crowded, for good reason, so make reservations. - Mark & Rebecca"}
{"text":"The food the service and the atmosphere are good not great. I have been here several times and each time I am whelmed. They tend to go a little heavy on the dirty rice but other than that I can't complain. The overall experience was very meh."}
{"text":"My favorite place in az as of yet ... I've never had anything I don't like ... The whole menu is great & drinks are just as yummy"}
{"text":"Best creme Brule I've had in arizona! And the half smoked Half fried alligator appetizers are to die for! And I had never even tried alligator before! I've had it in a few other places but this by far is the best! I'm guessing it's supposed to be \"fancy\" but people come however they want to dress. So don't worry about it if you are in jeans"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTLY FABULOUS!!!!!! Amazing staff and even better food! Alligator was good and mahi mahi was great too! Look behind the bar for the secret outside private patio tables!! You won't regret this place!"}
{"text":"I acually always go here with my mother who absolutly loves this place!  I think the service is great and the food is really delicious!  I am a fan of spicey food, and they totally meet the standard here.  I like everything about this place, I only give it a 4 star rating because the menu is too freaking huge!  I never know what to get since there are so many creole and cajun dishes and they use lingo more native to like Loiusiana, so I don't know what it means.  But all in all a great experience every time.  My mother even chose this place to go to after her wedding.  So cute mom!"}
{"text":"If you looked at any of my previous reviews, you'll see I eat all over the country!  This is one of the few places I've tfound to be very consistant,  excellent service, great decor, and some of the best food you'll find for Cajun restaurant, that has a multi-state presence!  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is its always busy plan, so ahead! Secondly it is pretty pricey $$$$! So definitely bring your favorite credit card,  you'll need it! Overall this is one of the best locations, and the Servers, the Management team,  just really great folks. I think you'll find nothing but a wonderful experience for you, Family, and Friends."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for Happy Hour.  The bartenders were friendly and made fresh squeezed orange juice for my drink. Had a really good half size fondue app.  Dinner was delicious... The best scallops I have had! 

Also had a really good atmosphere. The patio section was beautiful!"}
{"text":"I ve been to Pappadeaux about 6 or 7 times and this time was the worst. The service was very good but the food was overpriced for the amount we got. I always order the same thing,Pasta Mardi Gras, and never could finish it before but this time there was less than half of the normal amount. Disappointing.  mY wife got the scallops and she got 3 tiny, tiny scallops for $25.  The last time we went the same thing happened but I chalked up to a 1 off. Overall, a very good place to eat but the last 2 times have been disappointing COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS 2 YEARS.  I may be unfair judging a restaurant by the amount of food given but spending $25 for a pasta dish, I guess I am used to copious portions."}
{"text":"Go here frequently and usually get Lobster and Filet Mignon. I can honestly say I personally have never eaten anything here that wasn't of great quality from Lobster, Filet Mignon, blackened salmon, Southwest Grits, Lobster Mac & Cheese, even tried alligator for the first time here and it was delicious (I believe that's the name of the Grits  and Mac & Cheese). I can honestly say I don't have one complaint from ever going here."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great! Server (Matt) was very knowledgeable and helpful. We had crab and blackened mahi, both were great. Also never had to ask for a refill, my iced tea was always full!"}
{"text":"If we didn't submit a review previously back in November 2017, sorry - we ate here, loved it, and are coming back for more!! We live in Missouri but found this place when we came to Phoenix 6 months ago; thanks to yelp. The seafood is T-O  D-I-E  F-O-R!!! Brent even brought his father and brother when they came to Phoenix last month for a golf week. Raw oysters look amazing and are very popular!! They are shucked by Jose, a really sweet, attentive \"mother-shucker\". Don't forget to tip your shucker!! :)  Brent has gotten the crawfish etouffee all three times, and has LOVED it every time!! I got the small fried shrimp and then this time got the fried shrimp and scallops. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! While Pappadeux's appears to be a chain - we saw one in Albuquerque, we are lucky there isn't one in KC!! We'd be fat but happy!! Btw - my fried shrimp and scallops is not on the menu, but our awesome bartenders, Susan and Amanda, said it's not a problem whatsoever to do a fried combo, so they got exactly what I was craving. And it's beyond words!! And look at the size of the baked potato. Amanda/bartender said this was a small one. :/  Amanda and Susan worked their butts off at this large bar, but were extremely attentive despite the rush of people and drinks. They had awesome smiles and great, friendly attitudes!! The bar is where you get the best service!!! For those of you with larger parties, larger than Brent and I, there appears to always be large parties of 8-10 people that get seated quickly. Don't let the filled parking lot scare you off!!! Come - enjoy this place!! You will have a wonderful, YUMMY meal!! And - as the added bonus - they have Diet Coke!!! :). That's not why they got 5 stars, though!! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places.  Great seafood and great service.  A bit busy sometimes but that comes with being a great restaurant.  Everyone wants to eat there.  And this place has been packed since opening night.

Try the crawfish platter or the jumbo shrimp brochette.  Both are outstanding.  But then, pretty much everything is."}
{"text":"Eaten here at least 50 times...Best west westside seafood ever...And fresh!"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming in and it was great! The food was really good and the service was even better!! Thank you Jaclyn for making my dads birthday dinner special!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great customer service. The only bad part was when my pregnant hormonal fiancé saw a gentlemen taking a lobster from that big tank to its death lol."}
{"text":"I have been to this location four times.  The first was good.  The fourth was flawless (and also on a Sunday @ 11 AM).  The second and third were disastrous.  The third, unfortunately, was my birthday.  

The BOTTOM LINE:  
I would go back, my spouse will not.  However, I would not risk a special occasion on this restaurant.  

THE GOOD:  
(1) a something-for-everyone menu 
(2) truly spectacular tasting menu items 
(3) managers seem genuinely contrite, and they are adroit at making good on mishaps. 
(4) reservations are accepted, but waiting with a drink on the patio is a great experience.

THE BAD: 
(1) a service bar so slow during dinner peak that you'd think the first step in making your drink was applying for a liquor license. 
(2) if you're like me and appreciate a well paced meal, you'll have to DIY-it by specifying to the server when the kitchen is OK to begin preparing the next course. (inept and thoughtless pacing happened 3 of 4 times) 
(3) You will invariably be first sat under a full-blast A/C vent or fan aimed at your upper back, and you will have to request a new table. (happens every time I sit inside)  

The UGLY:
The food quality is inconsistent. (3 of 4 visits resulted in myself or someone in my party sending back a deficient item for being too cold, overcooked, watery, etc.)  Rectifying the problem takes long enough to ruin the pacing of the meal for the table as whole.  Ordering is slight gamble, which, for a restaurant, is the deadliest sin of all."}
{"text":"Don't come often but every time we do the food is always great!  Definitely get the Mediterranean calamari!  Personally can't get enough of the crawfish étouffée.  Service is always great, the waitstaff definitely know the menu."}
{"text":"Overpriced, Food average, extremely overcrowded, slow service. Waited 1/2 hour only to be sat at the bar crammed next to a wooden pole, that my right arm was jammed against it (my friend was seated on the OTHER side of the pole too), sigh, so difficult to carry on a conversation. It wasn't worth it, & I will not be returning. Crab Shack, Blue Water Grill much better."}
{"text":"We just left Pappadeaux's and had a wonderful evening! Our server Jalissa, was so engaging and informative. She let us know our options before choosing our food. We had the Filet mignon  with lobster tails. Delicious! Then to top it off, we were served a complimentary yummy dessert for our Anniversary. We are looking forward to returning and hopefully having Jalissa again. Thank you for a great night!"}
{"text":"I treated a young friend to her 1st real New Orleans oysters. We began with orders of oysters on the half-shell and Pappadeaux's version of Oysters Bienville (baked cheese topping). I lived in New Orleans for years, so I was disappointed at the soup-y cheese that couldn't stick with the oyster -- took the adventure out of it completely. My favorite, Oysters Rockefeller, was substituted by their version adding hollandaise sauce to the spinach (yuck!) so we passed.

The entrees went better. I had the Shrimp with Andouille Sausage & Red Beans (excellent red beans!) and she got the Shrimp Po Boy & Gumbo combination. We topped off with Praline Bread Pudding in Bourbon Sauce. Highly recommended.

Service was mediocre. Our server was no help even tho I mentioned it was her 1st oyster outing. I tried to the point of frustration to order the appetizers, and she only regurgitated the menu to me repeatedly. I knew how to read. I didn't know how to order combo raw oysters & oysters bienville in a way she could understand, even tho I've done so hundreds of times at Felix's or Antoine's or nearly any New Orleans restaurant. After waiting 20min for our check, we stood to leave and she brought check to us at the hostess stand, so being cumbersome, I signed for a $75+ bill writing a large 15% pointing to tip line and left. Not a big thing, but my checking account was deducted for a $15 tip instead, which I would have not blinked except the service was not worthy of over 15%. For the $3.25 hustle at the register, they got the motivation to write this review. Sad, as I had looked forward to *my kind of restaurant from my old neighborhood.*

The manager did present himself at our table to clear up an allergy question, and he was outstanding. I told my friend, \"Now he's like the waiters usually are in a good restaurant!\" Friendly, interested, concerned, competent, professional. Not so with the overly-tipped waitress."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful services. I love Cajun food, and living in the desert doesn't help. My husband and I love this place, it's the closest thing we can get to the south. Service Carla was so knowledgeable,  wonderful, and gracious. Give her a raise ya'll!"}
{"text":"Soooooo yummy!!! I love the dirty rice and their shrimp is to die for, along with some of the best scallops I have ever had. My family comes here every New Years Eve, and we have always had exceptional service. This year we sat on the patio and we had the BEST server. He was super nice and he really paid attention to what we needed. He kept our table clean and our glasses full! He was so great. And Megan, the kitchen manager is so awesome! She came out and asked us how our meal was, and she was so wonderful. Love this restaurant and its staff."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times and every time it is very good. Steaks and seafood are fresh. Service is good every time. Love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Had the Moroccan Salmon and the Sea Bass. Outstanding! This place ranks up there with Emeril's New Orleans Fish House.  Make sure to ask for Johnny C. to be your server.  He was the best!  Made great suggestions and was very attentive."}
{"text":"very enjoyable,  fun atmosphere with hearty portions.  the seafood was wonderful,  better than expected for Arizona. 
service was friendly and fast.
would go again on next visit"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Quick seating for a city, friendly staff, and delicious food.  Crawfish Etoufee with dirty rice was the bomb! The cheesy grits are a nice surprise with the sweet crunch of the corn.  Loved it.  The desserts are ginormous and can easily be split two or three ways!"}
{"text":"This place. I was seriously looking forward to this restaurant. From the reviews I read, pictures I've seen, I was very excited to try it out. 

I initially called to make my reservation, within seconds of speaking with an employee, I received a text confirming my reservation. I received a text a day prior to my reservation as a reminder. I thought all of that was very cool. 

Walking into this restaurant, I was shocked to see how full it is. Which leads me to my review... 

Let's have a seat, shall we?!

We started off with the Calamari. Large sized. Which cracked me up when it got to the table. The large size looked like the medium size. So I'm not sure I would want to see what the medium size looked like. Was it a \"large size\" because it had two small bite size pieces of fried zuchinni? The calamari, which I heard was the very best, was mediocre at best. It wasn't all it was made out to be. The little fried bits tasted like churches chicken. Not cute. 

Onto my main course. I got the Mardi Gras pasta thing. It sounded amazing, looked amazing, smelled amazing, however, it wasn't as good as I had hoped. 

As with other reviews I read, the lobster tail is overcooked. It tasted as if it was previously frozen, cooked, and then left under a heat lamp until it was chosen. 

The cheesecake slice for desert was massive, it was ok. 

Our waiter, John, was great. He was at our table at appropriate moments. He wasn't over bearing, or no where to be found. 

All in all, I wouldn't go skipping to this place. It wasn't what I had imagined. I will not be back, thumbs down."}
{"text":"Just returned from sleep inducing dinner at Pappadeaux's. 

In my stomach: half dozen (actually 8) raw oysters, Pontchartrain fillet, and peanut butter cheesecake. 

Service was A+... luckily Justin (our waiter) was a jovial one. 

Will update next time with details. 

My system will have the sweetest sleep tonight."}
{"text":"I will come back...the food was excellent the fres  fish was very fry just.  The restaurant was nice."}
{"text":"This is the place that food dreams are made of. I love Pappadeaux. Although I have not been here in a few years now. Time goes by fast.
But, as always it was wonderful!!! Our server was John and he could not of been better!
We sat inside although it was a lovely day out. This place is decorated so beautifully , you forget you are in Phoenix. The outside Patio area is amazing and so peaceful. It really just adds to the wonderfulness of it all.
Our food was divine! Really good. I started with a cup of the Seafood chowder. Even the Bread and Butter were great!
For my meal I had Shrimp and Grits, so good! My friend had Tilapia with Hazelnuts. She let me have some. Oh my gosh! Divine, and I cannot wait to go back here.
We even got Dessert and shared it , but we could not finish it all. It was such a large item. The Brownie cake it was.

Lots of parking here, Restrooms are clean and nicely decorated as well. The decor inside and outside is great. The staff are wonderful. I have always had a great experience here."}
{"text":"Ate here with my husband for a small dinner while we were visiting friends in Phoenix. Since this restaurant was within walking distance (less than a 5 minute walk) to the hotel we were staying in (Candlewood Suites), we decided to eat here. The first thing I thought of when we came in here was that this was one of those expensive tourist restaurants... and well it is (well duh, it's located right next to a few hotels). 

Anyways, when we first came in here (sometime after 9 pm), no one acknowledged us. There was no one by the hostess area. So we waited by the front for a few minutes before deciding to just walk over to a table and seat ourselves. When we sat ourselves at a booth near the bar, a server saw us and brought us 2 menus. 

We ordered the following:

Crispy Fried Alligator: We got a large order and was surprised that it didn't really come with a lot of pieces. Would really have liked to have more, especially since the price tag was a bit high. Anyways, my husband wanted to order this because well, how many opportunities do you get to eat alligator? It was tasty, but a little on the oily side. And it tasted like chicken (but you know, a lot of things taste like chicken). I don't know if I would ever order this again just because of the price tag and I didn't really feel like my palate was wowed a new culinary treat.

Louisiana Seafood Gumbo: We ordered a bowl to share and really liked the flavor of the gumbo. My husband just wished that there were more seafood pieces in this instead of just a few pieces of shrimp and mostly sausage. 

The service we received was below average... Our server only came to our tables a total of 3 times (1 to get our order, 2 to bring us our food and 3 to bring us our check). He was not attentive to refilling our water and so I had to find another employee to get us some more water. The place wasn't even busy at all, there was just a handful of tables with people eating and no one at the bar. The place was basically empty (pretty spacious, which made the emptiness more noticeable). 

The ladies' restroom was clean and there is plenty of parking in the lot. 

Overall, would not come back. Food is overly priced and nothing seemed to wow us. This is just one of those tourist traps who just like the convenience of dining here due to proximity to their hotel."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and twice I have been satisfied. Of course the parking lot get's full after 1 pm , poeple want to dine with friends and family also the waiting patios gets full very fast. So make time to plan it. Well, any ways  , My wife and I tried the Gumbo and Shrimp Coktail , Pasta Mardi Gras and Shrimp  Scallop Pasta. For Dessert the \" Dessert Trio \" ..  Pricey but Good.. I dont' always dine here, but when I  do I enjoy it..... There is alot of plates to choose from they look good. Very good come and check it out ."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on New Orleans seafood by any means, but the mixed seafood grill was very good.  Everything was cooked perfectly, which is quite a trick, especially with the variety of meats on the skewer.  I would have saved some for leftovers, but my hotel room doesn't have refrigerator or microwave :(

The only thing I could have wished for is wild Pacific salmon instead of the Atlantic salmon, but I guess that would make it less authentic.

I dined on the patio, so I didn't much of a feel for the ambience inside, but it did seem rather loud as I passed through the lobby..."}
{"text":"We had a party of 21...Excellent food and service. Timely, delicious. Personally I had mussels, everyone loved their dinner. The service was superb! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Pappadeaux has been one of my family's favorite seafood restaurants in Phoenix for several years......until today!

We just went for dinner fairly early to beat the Friday rush.  We ordered our drinks and appetizer, approximately 15 minutes later my beer showed up after I had to ask the waiter for it again.  That was the first disappointment but was actually the least disappointing!

We ordered our food and were patiently waiting, we understand that the food does not arrive immediately.  20 minutes went by...then 30.  After about 40 minutes the waiter came out and let us know that he was sorry it was taking so long and that our food was coming right out.  After this extremely long wait our 22 month old son was at the end of his rope and was out of patience.  We told them that we had to have the food to go since it had been so long.

The manager came out and apologized to us and offered us either a free desert or a gift certificate ($7 desert or $50 gift certificate...don't take the desert!).  We do appreciate the gift certificate, however the disappointment was not over.

We got home to eat the food (travel time only about 15 minutes).  My fried oysters were cold and soggy, I assume they had been sitting on the counter for quite awhile before they packaged them up for us.  My son's kids shrimp meal ended up being only 4 shrimp in the box with no fries!  My wife was also not very happy with her fish, very bland and not satisfying.

We are very disappointed that Pappadeaux's has sunk to this level, we used to love it in the past but will not be eating there again.  To whoever we end up giving the gift certificate to.....sorry!"}
{"text":"We have been there several times, & have always had exceptional experiences. They acknowledged our date night we posted on Twitter, & we were impressed they took the time to comment."}
{"text":"Given this restaurant so many chances and all fails.  This is not to review the bar area service, which is excellent.  The restaurant itself is like a different entity.  

Last night took two guests for a birthday dinner.  Place was empty but by the time we placed our order (45 mins later!) it was packed.  Server (Bryan) was in the worst I can remember; unfriendly, ignorant about the menu, rude to all three of us, failed to offer more drinks, never came back to ask about meals, and this is only the beginning.

To start I ordered oysters appetizer; at 6:30 on a Tuesday they were all out.  Came time to order dinner and chose crab legs; guess what, all out. 
Now I know this isn't the server's fault, but in addition, two lobster dinners were completely charred black, dry and tough - like lobster jerkey.  After 1 1/2 hrs. no time to send back so stuck it out.  At one point Bryan was no where to be seen for over half an hour.  He never came to offer dessert until we flagged him down for our bill.  Got there at 6PM and were out at 8:50 - that's how long this disaster took."}
{"text":"I had often heard of this place and was excited to go. I must say that I was not disappointed at all. The customer service was excellent from beginning to end.  The peach ice tea was great, with a fresh taste to it. We ordered the large basket of calamari which was shared between 3 people. Large, warm  French bread was included and it was fresh. With so many options to choose from, I chose the Seafood Platter. The seasoning was not overwhelming, but rather just enough, to still know you had seafood on your plate. This meal is actually enough to share with your special person. 

I highly recommend this place for just about any special occasion or with a group of friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Pappadeaux for lunch today, and I have to say I was disappointed. The bread before the meal was dry and a bit stale, and the shrimp in my salad had a bleach taste to it, which was absolutely awful. 
We've been to this restaurant before, and had a much better experience, but it's been a while.
We won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. My sister and I took my mom there to celebrate her birthday. The down side was for a Wednesday night we had to wait 45 min for a table, and we could see open tables this was at 7pm. They should have had all the servers on by that time. But other then that it was great. The food was so good. We had the fondue which is rich creamy. The seafood is fresh and delicious. I would definitely return. Our server was great and they even gave my mom a birthday dessert. Thank you all for the great time."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with our daughter before heading back to Missouri. Would like to stay and eat here again!  Superb lunch for all and delicious key lime for dessert. A wonderful place with a very nice atmosphere along with great service. What more is to be said !"}
{"text":"Third time here and they've yet to disappoint! Our server, Audrey was friendly and very attentive to our needs. Boyfriend and I shared the Pasta Mardigras and the desert trio, both of which were really good. The pasta had just the right amount of seafood and the desert trio was more than enough to share between two people or more.  Overall, a good dining experience with great customer service and good food."}
{"text":"Great great food. I come to Phoenix every couple weeks for business from La Jolla and still can't believe the seafood here is 10 times better. This place is a jewel.  I also like the AC in the bar is now nice and cold"}
{"text":"I love this place! They don't have it on the menu any more but one of my favorite things you can still order is Mediterranean style calamari. The gator appetizer has the best sauce too. My favorite experience there was when they had a live jazz band playing. It's very noisy and crowded and usually you have to wait for a table but it's SO worth it if you like seafood."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and myself have been discussing where we should eat for our first anniversary so he brought up a place called papadeux. He added some details about this resturant and the food was mostly southern themed. Also, the cost is a bit pricey but worth the trip to dine there. I decided to read up the reviews and did some light skimming based on people's experiences here.

Finally, on our anniversary we drove up to papadeux which was around 8 - 8:30 when we got there. Luckily, they closed at 10pm so *whew*. lol. 

I already knew what I wanted due to looking at other people's reviews on which entrees were good. 

The place was really lovely and words can't describe how romantic this could be coming here on our first anniversary *hearts*

When we arrived, it was pretty empty and very dim too, I wasn't sure how to take it but I was just nervous and excited to arrive to such a lovely and uppity place. 

We were seated immediately and our waiter was Johnny. I really loved our waiter! He was very attentive, very well mannered and had a really good intuition which he could anticipate our expectations and such. I was so awed and wowed by this waiter and there couldn't be anything more lovely then having a wonderful and smooth service.

He asked if this was our first time here and I mentioned that my boyfriend has been here once but this is my first time so Johnny came around my side and opened up my menu and just went through each section of the menu and explained a bit of some of the popular dishes for each category. Which i loved! *hearts*

so I picked out an appetizer, I don't remember what the name of the appetizer was but it was really good! I had the lobster bisque soup with lobster chunks in it....oh man that was soooooooooooo delicous and the lobster was a bit chewy but still tastey!

 Then I had the costa rican naked tilapia the 7oz, now that was seriously good *drools*

But in between our dishes, johnny kept checking up on us and communicating about our food and the time which was very excellent customer service...i mean his service was so top notch I couldn't have been any more happier *smiles*

He also was talking story to us and I loved that. I really could tell that he was very laid back and wanted to get to know us a bit and also asked if there was anything he could do for us. He also was curious if there was a special occasion as to why we were here and I mentioned that it was our first year anniversary and he smiled and congratulated us *blushes* I seriously felt that johnny just knew we were here on a special occasion and he has a really good intuition. Again, such an awesome waiter!

towards the end of our lovely meal both of us were getting a bit full and I must admit that the food at papadeux is really rich but delicious food *drools* I couldn't admit defeat yet and I went on to getting desert . I got the banana bread pudding and I was sooo full but I was determined to finish it so I wolf that sucker down. lmao. Though I was bloated and full and...just wanted to roll out instead of walking. lmao. food was really good.

In the end, my first experience went so smooth and perfect for our first anniversary that I was very very happy and I am hoping to come back again for another special occasion!

I do want to add that johnny was so lovely and helpful and he boxed up all of our left over meals. He is such an awesome waiter! If any of you guys get him, you'll be taken cared of very well!"}
{"text":"Even though when we first came in this yahoo cut in front of us in line and called him a jerk...and he did not care. The wonderful hostess seen what happened and put us in front of him. 
This place is a total 5***** restaurant, to me a ways. 
I am what is called a picky, picky person. But, our server Kody was one amazing person. Very friendly, over the top informative, thee best. The food and drinks (drink, Garden of Eden)... were the best I have had in quite some time. I have been to some other places that were in equivalent pricing and quality food. They can't even surpass this place. 
Yes, it was our first time here. We will be back."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! My brother and I have had lunch here a couple of times and the food has been excellent both times.

We tried the alligator bits. As cliche' as it may sound, it \"tastes like chicken\".

Although people always make fun of me for it, I like catfish. I ordered the blackened catfish with dirty rice and it was excellent. Portions are very large and I couldn't finish my meal (although not for lack of trying). My brother had the tilapia on one occasion and a mixed seafood dish on another. Both were great.

The seafood tastes fresh, the location is great and the service staff is friendly. Also, I love the patio in the entrance area. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING was delicious!! Our food, appetizers & drinks. We left there happy, full - totally satisfied. This location was everything I thought it would be. I've only been to the location in Atlanta but so happy I got a chance to visit this location also!"}
{"text":"I was in phoenix for the day and had a craving for oysters on the half shell.  Living in a small town in northern Arizona a person does not have that luxury.  Went there for lunch ordered the blue point oysters, gumbo and shrimp poor boy. The oysters were  ice cold and fresh as you will find anywhere. Everything there was great including the service.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly, and always have a pleasant experience.  I am absolutely addicted to their green beans in lemon butter sauce.  They have excellent Salmon and believe it or not, their chicken dish is one of the best around, even for a seafood restaurant.  I have had some incredible waiters and waitresses! Very attentive and engaging!  Great customer service, and they really make the experience just that much more wonderful.  A waitress in particular comes to mind, which has served me over four times now.  Julia is her name, and she absolutely did a fabulous job! So so so many good things to say about her!!!  There are a few other waitresses that really have gone above and beyond in service.  Im terrible at names, and for the life of me, cannot remember the others.  But I am always blown away by how fabulous their wait staff is at this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Location: Phoenix, AZ

Parking: Not an issue at all since I walked here from my hotel, but there's a massive parking lot with many available spaces.

Ambiance: The ambiance and decor immediately transport you to the bayou, although I have never been to the bayou and only know it from what I've seen in the media.  Went twice during my stay in Phoenix.  Once during dinner and also a to-go order for lunch.  During dinner, it was very dim and some would say too dim to even see what you are eating.  Very loud so you can forget about having a nice, tranquil conversation with whomever you are dining alongside.

Service: DINNER - service was ok.  I got really irked when I asked for recommendations from our waiter.  Their menu is massive and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  I asked for some recommendations and the waiter immediately blurted out the most expensive thing on the menu and nothing else.  Hmm so just one recommendation...do you really think that's good, or are you just fishing for a bigger bill which will lead to a bigger tip?  Water refills were on time, and the wait staff was for the most part attentive, so the recommendation thing was the only major downfall.
LUNCH - Called in my order and said it would be ready in 10-15 min.  Walked over from my hotel (about a 10-15 min walk) and went inside.  Hostess pointed me to the to-go pick-up area.  Went over and waited for another 5 min before being attended to.  Paid for my order and waited another 5 min before receiving my food.  Waited a total of 20-25 min for my food.  Not that big of a deal, but they should know this for future reference.

Food: DINNER - After receiving a short-ended recommendation, I had to look over the menu a little bit more so my table mates placed their orders first.  I ended up getting the Crawfish Etoufee.  The dish was filled with crawfish.  Everything tasted fine except the white rice.  I'm Filipino so I've had my fair share of rice in my lifetime.  This rice tasted like minute rice.  That might fly in Phoenix, but in my world I expect something a little better.  At least the rest of the dish kinda sorta made up for it.  Portions are huge!  Everyone at my table had leftovers.  I would've had leftovers too but I was pretty hungry and ended up leaving super stuffed!
LUNCH - I ordered the \"Louisiana\" Seafood Gumbo & Shrimp Po Boy.  Now this was good!  Gumbo had a bounty of different seafood and tasted awesome.  The po boy had plenty of fried shrimp.  The bread on the po boy could have been better.  When I dipped the po boy into the gumbo MAN OH MAN was that BANGIN!!  Here's a tip for a new menu item: instead of a \"French Dip,\" how bout a 'FRENCH QUARTER' DIP = Shrimp Po Boy + (\"Louisiana\" Seafood Gumbo - white rice).  Dip the po boy in the gumbo and as Chef Emeril Lagasse would say BAM!!!

Overall: 3.5 STARS this place is A-OK.  It is a bit overpriced.  If it weren't for the great lunch I had, I probably would have given it a lower rating.  Get the GUMBO and PO BOY and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay so this place is pure indulgence. Not a restaurant for someone trying to watch the calories. Long story short: the food was excellent, atmosphere fun, service great, and desserts AMAZING. 

The long review: we were able to call ahead which was a lifesaver. This place was BUSY and for good reason. We waited about 15 minutes where others were being quoted 45-60. When we got seated we started with the alligator. It was fun to try. I honestly think it tasted like any other meat since it was battered and fried. Anything tastes good fried, right?  What made it special was the dipping sauce. I liked it. For dinner my husband ordered some type of fish with the dirty rice. I could not stop eating his rice. I would love to know the secret ingredient.  I ordered the shrimp platter and it was heavenly. The shrimp with crab cakes on top was seriously something I will be craving. 

The portions are huge. We were so stuffed and yet could not resist taking a peek at the desserts. We ended up taking them home to eat later after we walked off some of the food we ate. We dropped them off and later when we got home to eat them they were still delicious. 

We got the bread pudding and banana pudding. I don't usually care for bread pudding but they have converted me with theirs. The next day we ate the banana pudding and again- I am converted. We bought our babysitter the chocolate cake and she seemed to really like it. 

Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. I ordered a half dozen Gulf oysters. It took 30 minutes to serve them. My dining buddy finished his appetizer and waited to order his main course.

I ordered a second glass of wine which took 10 minutes. Maybe our server, Alexa, was overwhelmed but it sucked.

If I return, I will sit at the bar.

F"}
{"text":"We know it is a chain, but the food is consistent and good.  It is a little expensive and can get crowded."}
{"text":"Such good bread and butter at the beginning we knew it would be good! The Sea bass was delicious but my spinach was undercooked! Also the crab dip is Such good bread and the Seanad was delicious! Also the crab dip is so good! We are stuffed! It's a little pricey but good!so good! We are stuffed! It's a little pricey but good!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and enjoyed the happy hour. We went for a dinner last week for my birthday and remembered why we hadn't gone for a full meal here in about five years. The food is fine, but overpriced. A small cup of gumbo is $9, which isn't worth it as it's just okay, not great, and it isn't like any gumbo I've had before. It's like vegetable soup with a few shrimp thrown in.
It's the service that needs so much improvement. It was a busy night, and we we're shown to a table that didn't have any utensils or napkins. The hostess didn't notice, the server didn't notice and the person who brought our apps out didn't notice. With our food sitting there getting cold, I left the dining room where we were seated and went into the main room and found napkins and utensils on a table, and as I headed back, I ran into our server and told her that I'd come out to get our utensils myself. She smiled and said very cheerfully, \"Oh, that's fine!\" As if I'd been apologizing.
By the time our meals came out I'd finished my cocktail and asked the person who brought our food for another and she said she'd get it. 25 minutes later, I'm done with my meal, and our original server walked by, saw my empty glass, and said, \"Oh yeah, I was suppose to put an order in for another.\" Says that to us, then runs off before I can say that I didn't want it any more. She brought it two minutes later and I drank half really quickly because we were paying for it, but we were done."}
{"text":"I had reservations at 8pm on Feb 10th, for 17. 17 wasn't able to make it which they stated was fine. It was 14 of us. They informed me that as long as majority of my party was there they'd seat us by 8p, well my whole party of 14 was at the establishment by 745. I informed them that my party was here they reassured me they'd get us seated. 805 comes around we're still waiting by the bar, my party was hungry and their feet were getting tired. I asked the, rude and dismissive, woman upfront and one stated their getting the tables together now, it'll be just a moment longer. So, 820/830 rolls around, now \"it's the party won't leave, they've been there for over 3hrs, and i cant ask them to leave, Im sorry\"...and this was stated by Kathy the Hispanic manager. We were not seated until after 9pm...approx 930 was when my party and I were seated at two different tables, not one as promised. The waiter Mike was awesome but the food was bland, and mediocre I did not eat my entree and neither did my friend next to me. It seemed rushed, taking they close at 10, it might've been. The manager did offer us free appetizers...but my whole birthday experience was ruined because of how they lied to us and then separated us at the tables, and made less than mediocre food. When I asked at 805 if we were getting seated she should have gotten the manager and told me the truth then, and the manager kept stating we'd be seated soon, but soon was an hr and a half later. Had I known they gave our table to another party we could've left and ate somewhere else. My friends/family and I loved Pappadeux before this horrible experience. We won't be giving them anymore of our service. Thanks for making my birthday experience and unforgettable one by the way we were treated."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food is excellent.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because on my the last visit my date and I were bombarded by flies (we sat towards the street by a window)
However the food is amazing!  Seriously, the only thing i've ever had bad here were all the dates I've been on.
The mediterranean calamari is orgasmic, the lobster bisque is yummy.  The service is good.  Get there early or else you'll be waiting, either for a seat at the bar or in the dining area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I've never been here before and when we showed up it was packed. No where to park and the wait was an hour to an hour and a half. So long story short we tried sitting in the bar and there was some miscommunication about where we were sitting. Meagan came and totally took care of us. I was shocked at her resolution for the problem. We were seated right away. I was like.... what!!!  She didn't have to do that. The service was great. The meal was so delicious. I just can't get over their level of customer service. I can't wait to come back and visit and eat here with my husband (we are from Dan Diego).  Oh by the way our server was Kaylene. She was so sweet and adorable. She played along with us and was funny. Loved her!! Thanks for making my last night with my girlfriend a memorable one!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night. Very busy. My husband had the MahiMahi with Dirty rice it was Bomb!! I had the shrimp, scallops with pasta which too me was way too salty and unedible. The waiter was very good offering me a replacement. Great customer service but very pricy for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today It was great, the food was great We had the Appetizer Trio, Pasta Mardi Gras, and the Mixed Seafood Grill. It was way more food than the two of us could eat. The server was very attentive and very helpful. I would recommend Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen to anyone who likes Cajun food or Seafood there is so much to choose from and basically the server said we could change anything on the menu to have it made just the way we wanted. AWESOME"}
{"text":"Haven't been here a long time not much has changed food is still pretty good for a large chain way better than Red Lobster I have the sea bass it was cooked perfectly very juicy great texture he can tell his fresh the calamari was okay at best little cold when I came out not very crispy didn't like the red sauce the white one was was little better but not much now that deserves a delicious at the banana putting and the bread pudding both are excellent we wanted the praline cheesecake which I've had in the past I think it's probably the best she's ever had but they were out one thing I did notice about here can see everyone has some kind of cocktail they do all of delicious though maybe next time I have to get one now for the service was it very very slow she didn't know much about the menu wasn't helpful I even had to go find my own picture of water I understand that they were slammed busy but I don't know how many tables she hand and she was never really around overall it's better than most places we have in Phoenix bless you up to Scottsdale and pay $100 a person probably be back lunch is probably best time to go little slower and food seems taste better"}
{"text":"The last few years while visiting our family in Phoenix, we seem to always fit in a visit here. Despite what my check-ins say, this was our 3rd visit and we have become quite the fans. The first time I came here, I was at the tail end of my pregnancy so instead of seafood, I chose the Pappardelle Pasta with spinach and butternut squash. It was pretty tasty but it was also pretty heavy.

This last two visits, I went for the live Maine lobster and I was in heaven. I thought it would be a lot of work but the kitchen did a really good job preparing it so the lobster meat came out of the shell really easy. This plate comes with pappardelle pasta but this last visit, I gave that to my little one to eat and got the cheese grits with andouille and corn for my side.  It was a good choice because not only were the grits super yummy, the pasta was the perfect size for the little one. She's going through a phase where all she wants is noodles and broccoli so it fit the profile. Even though the menu is extensive, this might have to be my go-to item on the menu. Can you ever go wrong with live main lobster? 

This restaurant is really large which means it can pack a lot of people in...which means it's LOUD but the perfect place to bring a toddler. ; ) To keep with her bedtime routine, we made a reservation for (5:15 pm) and still, we had to wait 10 minutes for our table. I was amazed how busy it already was. 

That being said, I'd highly recommend making reservations if you plan to come here. The place is a hot spot and I can see why.  We can't wait until our next years visit. ; )"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Love the crab cakes! I don't think I've had one dish that wasn't good."}
{"text":"Super expensive but super delicious! Great for a special occasion with a good group of people."}
{"text":"love the place! it speaks for itself only thing is the long wait. What can you expect. After years of coming here it still a very nice and fun  place to have dinner and enjoy the live music."}
{"text":"Loved it. We always go and the food it great. The service is on point and the look is old fashioned. Reminds me of a simpler time."}
{"text":"What an interesting concept...

Seafood in the desert.

Nevertheless, it was very good and probably the best meal that I had in Phoenix.

The things that we ordered:

1. Oysters
2. Gumbo
3. Ahi Tuna
4. Fried Alligator 
5. Calamari

The food was delicious. Although I was hesitant, the alligator was quite delightful - It was surprisingly flavorful and tender.  The servers were very accommodating and it was an great atmosphere.

I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux's a bit difficult to get to but you would expect it to be difficult to find Cajun food this far west.  Really popular place for the weekend crowd but if you call about 15 minutes before arriving they will put you on the wait list so that's nice.  Decor is pretty good but the dining room is so big it sort of feels like a factory, maximize the number of times the tables can be filled and flipped.

Well, that's enough about that...bar was kind of disappointing especially since they do not carry any southern beers, no Abita no Dixie.  I was actually surprised about the beer selection being so sparse, if I remember correctly 8 choices, nothing really a standout.  The food....it was ok.  She had the steak...a rib eye if I remember correctly, it was not a 37$ steak by any means.  Presentation was not great at all  meat looked lumpy and misshapen.  I had the crawfish étouffée and fried crawfish.  It was ok...really nothing special.  Étouffée was by far much better than the fried but I did not walk away waiting to come back again.  For a starter I had a dozen raw oysters on the half shell.  They were the highlight of the night by far.  Nothing else really wowed either of us.  

Bottom line:  if you're craving some Cajun this is the place to go in the phoenix area, but you will probably not leave feeling like you just had a memorable experience."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Pappadeaux when I asked him where we should go for our anniversary dinner.  The restaurant itself is beautiful both inside and out.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and seated very quickly.  We didn't love where we were seated though, feeling as though we were in the middle of a walkway.  The dining room wasn't very full when we arrived, so we think we could have been seated in a less busy location, but it is what it is.  

We ordered the fried calamari appetizer and we're a bit disappointed in the size for the price.  There was a lot of just batter prices and fried artichokes (something we'd never had in calamari before), and not as much actual calamari.  We were concerned that our entree might be lacking too, but they most definitely were not.  I ordered the Texas redfish Pontchartrain which was delicious!  It came in a le!on butter sauce with some shrimp and crabmeat and dirty rice.  Hubby ordered the Jumbo Shrimp Brochette, which was bacon wrapped shrimp filled with Monterey Jack and a jalapeno sliver with dirty rice.  He really enjoyed his as well.  The entrees were a great size.  For dessert we had crème brulee, which was very good too.  

Overall, a very good meal and we will probably return, although we're not likely to order the calamari again.  And really, we didn't need an appetizer because they brought out warm, crusty French bread and that is really all the appetizer we needed."}
{"text":"My wife and children splurged on me for father's day and brought me here knowing how much I love it.  We were sat immediately which anyone who knows this place is a miracle!  ....we were thrilled!  The place was buzzing with people being sat and I heard each of the wait staff we passed say happy Father's day when we were greeted by our waitress, Ashly, not even as much as a welcome to Pappadeauxs....  We ordered our drinks and when my martini was served it look half full so my wife asked in a comical way where the rest of it was and if looks could kill...she would have been vaporized!  We are a very comical family and when we go out, which is usually limited to special times or celebrations, we lime to have fun and Ashly wasn't having any part of it.  She was strictly business and throughout the entire meal we never got as much as a smile.  We had a heck a time getting her attention whenever we needed refills or any service.  We cannot complain of the food but we were VERY disheartened by the service we received and if we choose to spend our next special night out Pappadeauxs we will make sure we are not being waited on by Ashly."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Audry-our waitress-AMAZING! Took care of us quick and with a great smile. Prices were a tad more than we expected. Alligator was excellent with fresh squeezed lemon."}
{"text":"I do not usually review chains as a general rule; However I made an exception in this case.  It has an unusual location (on a freeway surface road) If I could give the service 100 stars I would in a second! In a busy restaurant on a Saturday night I almost expect less than par service.  The management in this place is definitely doing something right tons of customers tons of staff so we never wanted for anything (refills exc.) My fried shrimp was good not great and the fries were borderline room temperature and tasted like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a while.  The atmosphere was so cute and creole warm! And I can not rave enough about the staff, even walking out every employee we came in contact wished us a good evening even servers that was not ours.  I will be back to try something different for sure!"}
{"text":"Our meal at Pappadeux was excellent, I ordered the crawfish étouffée/Fried crawfish combo.  I was a little leary as I have traveled this year to New Orleans and even the server wasn't sure how it would compare.  Note - it was excellent. My dad had the catfish (as always) and it did not disappoint.  My mom only had the lobster bisque and a wedge said and again she loved it.  

Mom also had Creme Brûlée and again it was very good. She loved it and I liked it which is something since I rarely care for Creme Brûlée! 

The special cocktail which was made with watermelon was also excellent.  

The restaurant did a great job with seating is as my dad uses a walker so closer is better and this is a huge restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is my brother's favorite place to dine, and now I see why. My husband and I took my brother and his family out to Papadeaux's during our visit to Phoenix. 

Having just visited NOLA last year, I was impressed by the ambiance. The service was TOP NOTCH, and the food...my goodness! I got the Morrocan Salmon and Cous Cous...SO DELICIOUS!!!! I'm adding Papadeaux's to my food itinerary, right next to Karson's Kornbread in DTPHX. Oh and don't sleep on the banana pudding!"}
{"text":"Always a good time there.  Food is great and the service is amazing.  I need one to open one up in California."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and everything was great. Ordered the crab spinach dip for app and it was phenomenal! For my entrée I had the seafood mixed grill it came with shrimp, tuna, & scallop on top of dirty rice which was delicious with a little kick. For dessert we had the bourbon bread pudding, oh so delicious. It cam out hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, warning...this dessert is not for kids, you can taste all of bourbon goodness."}
{"text":"I Love LOVE LOVE this place!!!! The Bread melts in your mouth, Butter is so yummy!!! The Seafood is so Fresh and Perfectly seasoned..You can order Anything off the Menu and be Happy.. Drinks OMG again SOOOO FRESH,CREATIVE AND TASTEEEEE..I have even ordered Pies to go home on Holidays...ok I'm done..JUST GO..Thank me later lol"}
{"text":"I've had Pappadeaux in Dallas, Austin, Albuquerque and Phoenix and was more than satisfied every single time!  This is one of my favorite chain seafood restaurants!  The quality of the seafood at every location is suburb.  Big portions and flavor galore!

I must admit ... this location I think has the slowest service ... even at the bar!"}
{"text":"The alligator bites are so tender and tasty.. Thier fish is always fresh and cooked just right. If you have room for dessert try the bread pudding."}
{"text":"If you want Cajun food in Arizona, this is the place to go. 

If you want Oysters (remember, in season in months with an \"R\" in them) this is the best place in the valley to get them! 

If you want a giant hurricane with a skewer of fruit sitting on top, this is the place for that as well! What can I say, I love an alcoholic slushy!

My personal favorites are the Pappas greek salad, the gumbo and the crawfish etoufee. 

You'll pay a fair bit, but you'll never leave Pappadeaux hungry or unimpressed!"}
{"text":"Being from Louisiana / Mississippi I have a special spot in my heart (and stomach) for Cajun food. If you want truly authentic Cajun food then look no further than this restaurant off the I-17. Everything is great. No matter if you want broiled fish or fried seafood the taste is awesome and the price is good. The raw oysters are great. The crawfish platter is fanstastic. The crawfish bisque is to die for. The boudin is authentic and good served on a bed of white rice. The only other place in town for Cajun food is Baby Kay's. I'm posting a review of them as well."}
{"text":"Was it craving satisfied? Yes, indeed. This place took us down memory lane to our many trips back to New Orleans. I'm in love with their Mardi Gras Pasta. I even had left over sauce that I ate with rice it was so tasty and delightful."}
{"text":"Mostly disappointed. I'm from New York and no stranger to fresh seafood. I understand we're in Arizona and flown in is about as fresh as you can get. Be warned not EVERYTHING is flown in daily. Only one page of the menu is. My boyfriend and I shared frog legs, crab Mac n cheese and the Chilean sea bass. I will say the Mac n cheese was freaking delicious but I tasted very little crab. The frogs legs were the saddest of the 3. Just plain fried like the heap of French fries it comes with. No finesse or seasoning. A lot of their menu is just fried seafood. The sea bass was ok. I don't think they treated the fish amazingly and the toppings/accompaniments are lackluster. Overall nothing was really elevated or screamed fresh seafood. For the price and drive I will not be going back there. Check out little cleos for a much more exciting seafood experience."}
{"text":"Great seafood. I tried Alligator for the first time. It was pretty good. But the service could use a tune-up. My Son had Swordfish, I had Salmon, and my land lover Wife had Chicken. All were delicious and cooked perfectly. We love this place and will be back again."}
{"text":"Delicious seafood and expert staff who know their menu and their food inside and out. Expensive food but that is because their seafood is flown in by airplane fresh every single day. It is worth it. The dining area was a bit too crowded together, though."}
{"text":"Wow, super impressed! I've never been but have always heard about it. I generally try to stay away from huge chain restaurants, but this place wows. I started my meal with a 1/2 dozen raw oysters, super fresh and just perfect! I went with this blackened Mahi Mahi with crab, shrimp and crawfish in a spicy cream sauce. Holy hell, this dish was perfect. The seafood was cooked to perfection and everything seasoned well. All in all, a great meal and I'd definitely come back"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for the NFL Pro Bowl last weekend and had to try this place because it came with a very good recommendation. We had a dozen Taxes oysters, fried alligators and calamaris for appetizers and for dinner we had seafood gumbo, lobster bisque, and a seafood grilled combo which came with shrimp, white fish, vegetables and rice. Huge portions of food. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and taste really good. The servers were really attentive to all their customers. Oh the spicy Bloody Mary were very good also."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in world and they are from Texas! They never disappoint me, great service, great food, great atmosphere, clean restrooms,
if I give it a negative mark it would be the wait to get in, there is always a wait but it is so worth it!
Thank you Pappadeauxs!"}
{"text":"Pappadeaux's is by far my favorite seafood splurge in AZ! Although this place is a chain the customer service is always excellent as well as the food. I've been here many times and have never had anything I didn't think was extraordinary. This last time I went I ordered the Crawfish Etouffee with Dirty rice; every bite was loaded with crawfish it was so much I could only eat half. It was fairly priced at $20.95, which at any other restaurant I would tucked my tail and hide but the food here is well worth the price. For appetizers my favorites include the Lobster Bisque, Fried Alligator and Crab Fingers. The only thing I don't like about Pappadeaux's is they don't have free refills on the Strawberry Lemonade.  Which again is fantastic, it has a delicate balance of sweet and sour but the glass is so loaded with ice you're literally paying $3.50 per glass on about  cups of actual juice.  The atmosphere is fun the lighting is more on the dim side but it fits the New Orleans theme throughout the restaurant. This place handles large crowds like a champ, my group this past Saturday was a party of 12 and the server had no problems with remembering who ordered what, as well as properly splitting the check. I highly recommend the restaurant to any seafood lover. If you don't like seafood there are a few other options but not many; the few they have are well executed. I also recommend trying out the Chef's Special of the Night. This place has an outdoor patio and the band is always playing on the weekend which serves as great entertainment when waiting for your table."}
{"text":"Chilean sea bass is to die for. Bartender ryan was excellent.  Outstanding food and service. Oysters pappadeux were incredible."}
{"text":"One of the only spots in the Valley that I'll eat raw oysters.  Yes, I said it.  We live in the Valley.  No large bodies of water nearby. So, the chances of getting fresh seafood is slim to none. But I've always found Pappadeaux's to come through in that department! Not only are their oysters the bomb dot com but so are the crab fingers! I would also recommend picking out a lobster, most especially the larger ones to share because it is worth it! Desert is always great, too! We've celebrated birthdays and graduations here. I mean, what's not to celebrate here?! Staff are on top of their game and so is their food."}
{"text":"Food was ok but service and follow up was lacking...  waited over 20 minutes for water refills and just to check out was 15 minutes more than it should've been."}
{"text":"Came here the Saturday before Mother's day. It was busy, 1 hour and 45 minute wait, which we were expecting. We called earlier to make reservations, but were told all reservations booked up 2 weeks prior.

Got drinks & apps at the bar to pass the time. Closed out the tab there as it could not be transferred to the table.

When we finally sat, our waitress Megan did not bring out utensils. I had a few questions about the menu, she didn't know the answers. She compred some dishes as \"similar\" as her only form of description and after a simple google search, I found they were very opposite. We started to eat some bread after placing our orders, but there was no Megan around to ask for napkins. I saw a bucket and grabbed some for the table. A manager saw and half-apologized. 

Our food came 30 minutes later and my dish was completely wrong. Megan claimed my hard shell crab was soft shell. She claimed she brought me a dish that wasn't on the menu. She tried to cover up her mistake. I wasn't having the lies and just asked her to take it back. Not once did she apologize or say sorry. A different manager came over and gave me the right dish to go. 

Started to eat a side of the dirty rice someone at my table got, it had a LARGE onion shell in it and was very dry.

We tried to get our check but Megan disappeared. Waited another 10 minutes to flag her down.

It seemed they were understaffed - even though they had been expecting this crowd for over 2 weeks. Kinda felt bad for Megan, but that wasn't an excuse. Please steer clear of this place. Customer service and food are subpar."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant! I have never had a bad experience. The food is delicious, the environment reminds me of New Orleans and the staff is so friendly. Esther is our favorite waitress! We can go months without coming in and when we do, she remembers us immediately. We love the courtyard that greets you upon arrival and if you're lucky enough you can catch some live music on the weekends. The raw oysters are a must for us, they are always served super cold and taste great. My absolute favorite dish is the Pasta Mardi Gras. Flavor explosion!! I always make the mistake of filling up on the hot delicious bread and butter, but it works out since I always package the left overs and have a second meal (typically around midnight the same night )"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced, I think. It's really good... but not 5-star amazing. I've gone here many times before, and I'll come back eventually. This is a great place to take a date, but some of the seating is just awful. Who wants to sit near the entrance or on the edge of a hall with people constantly walking by and bumping your chair? Kind of annoying... especially when the place is empty and there are far better seats.

The little things are what get you 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Ordered takeout and sat at the bar while we waited. Friendly professional bartenders. I'm not a fan of calamari. As a matter fact I really dislike it however companion ordered it and of course I thought I'd try some again. It was delicious perfectly made.  The food came out promptly and it was very good except my rice and beans or very very spicy but good. The portions were also very good. I would most definitely go back to this restaurant the food was excellent the staff was friendly and professional and the wait was not long at all. I want to add that they don't have Jambolaya on the menu. Really strange for seafood place that spouts Cajun in Louisiana style seafood. Very big disappointment"}
{"text":"The food and the service was great. Kirk,our server, made our visit totally awesome. I would recommend this place if you love seafood and Cajun food. The cook George did an awesome job too."}
{"text":"Overpriced greasy, slimy food with below average service. Service was so so. Loud inside. My mother was looking forward to coming here and she couldn't wait to leave. Similar to Red Lobster. If you are looking for tasty seafood and a fun atmosphere, I'd say the Angry Crab is a good place"}
{"text":"The food was great!!!  We ordered gumbo, fried oysters, calamari, and a crawfish broil. The oysters and calamari were cooked to perfection!  Best I ever had. The crawfish boil was good as well. Seasoning was not over powering and 2.5 pounds were more than enough for my table of 3 to share. Only minor complaint I have was that the crawfish may have been overcooked as the meet wasn't so easy to get out of the shell. Either that or they weren't fresh. 

Everything else was good. Service was a little bit slow but to be expected on a Friday night when every table in the house is occupied."}
{"text":"This is a favorite place to go for us on a cold rainy day for some Gumbo and Cheesy Grits."}
{"text":"The gulf oyster on 1/2 she'll  were good. I love their own sauce. And on special for $9.95/fox. Love it!\"
M
We usually love Papadeaux French bread but The waitress brought us a not so fresh loaf of bread. That was disappointing.. Asked her to bring us a fresh baked one. Brought us same kind. Papadeaux either changed their French bread recipe or the bread back in the kitchen is just all stale and microwaved to warm up. First time to be disappointed with Papadeaux French bread. All their restaurants in Texas serve great fresh bread but Phoenix I guess has to microwave theirs. Greatly disappointing."}
{"text":"Happy Hour and Calamari with the fresh marinara is great! Also the Fondue is rich and cheeses. Customer Service is hit or miss. Some days they are fabulous while others they are dull and unhelpful and I end up having to reorder my food because it was incorrect."}
{"text":"OMG! I really love this place! The best seafood place in Phoenix! It's pricey but really worth every penny! The food will never disappoint. I like the fact that they have FRESH seafood deliver EVERYDAY! THAT'S A HUGE PLUS we're far from the waters. Highly recommended to anyone who love seafood!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service was exceptionally suburb, and overall a wonderful experience. I ordered the table size greek salad with 4 oz of lump crab (enough for 2 people) and the seafood kabob lunch portion. Sad we don't have a Pappadeaux in San Diego! But glad I visit PHX for work often enough and this is my go-to for lunch. 5 stars for the exceptional service our server Mia provided. She was attentive, friendly, on top of our refills and such a natural! She also provided great recommendations that we actually chose and was glad that we did. My colleague and I left as happy campers (as usual)!"}
{"text":"We went here yesterday evening to celebrate a birthday. Made the reservation several days in advance since we had a party of 20 expected. Really enjoy Pappadeaux's. We come here often enough and at times in larger groups. Once we were seated we were greeted by a really personable server. The food here is always great! I understand that a party of 20 can be challenging. We let the server know we would be doing separate checks right off the bat. I'm not sure what happened but the ends of the table were asked for a drink order and appetizer but the middle was never approached. Waters came out and bread. Next thing I know appetizers were out and I never got to put one in so I just figured ok entree it is. Well once again server came out to take the order sporadically. She would take an order and than walk away. I thought it was a little strange why not take all the entree orders at once? Well after the entrees came out no one came out to check on us or they would have found out we were missing three entrees. When those of us who got our food were finished we were left waiting for the check. Several in the party had to try and find someone to bring us the check and take the payments. At this point the dinner had gone on longer than what anyone had planned for and everyone needed to go home. We didn't even get to do cake and sing happy birthday because by the end everyone was feeling really disappointed and tired. The missing entrees eventually came out at the end of the meal. No manager came by to apologize for the service or to make sure everything was ok. Overall the food and drinks that did come out were great but the execution left little to be desired."}
{"text":"Fried alligator no way! Is what I've said before trying it here. We ordered the appetizer that also came with a cheese crawfish n shrimp fondue that I wanted to pick up and drink straight out of the cup. The portions are absolutely amazingly enormous! I was stuffed after the appetizer that could have easily fed 4 people. I am so glad we decided to share our main entree (Pasta Mardi Gras). We enjoyed the little kick it had which we later found out from our waitress she specially adds a little chili flake. If you like the spice might want to ask. I was very appreciative of the mindfulness of our waitress as well as she split our meal for us. The atmosphere is a little loud but that has to be because people love this place. We went on a Saturday night at 10 pm and the place was still full. The hostess told us that they just got over a rush! That speaks volumes. I stand by what Rachel Ray says, \"You go where the lines are\" it means it's good!"}
{"text":"Excellent Dinner.  Great food, service at a fair price. One of my favorites in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my recent date night at Pappadeaux.  The Hubs and I have been dying to try this place out thanks to all these amazing reviews on yelp and boy are they right.  The place was packed on a Saturday night at 5pm, which is a good indication one is in for a treat.  We made a reservation just in case, since we were going to see a show later that night.  Our waiter greeted us quickly and was very friendly and upbeat.  He told us the specials and took our drink order while we looked over the huge menu.

In the end we got the lobster roll appetizer, halibut, and bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was soooo... good and very filling.  The lobster appetizer was full of flavor, especially the sauce it came with.  The halibut was cooked perfectly and the grits on the side were amazing.  We loved the bread pudding, which was HUGE for the price.  I wish there weren't as many raisins, but all in all it was great.

So glad to have found this place!  I know it's a chain, which I usually don't love, but the old-school vibe and good quality/quantity of food made up for that.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! I have been coming here for years, especially when they have their seasonal crawfish and the all you can eat lobster deal. Their crawfish is nicely seasoned as it includes a corn and few small potatoes. My good friend always order the soft shell crabs and lobster bisque, both are delicious. Then again, all their food is delicious. 
The one thing I find good is their customer service. I've had a few visits where my food came out cold, too slow, or wrong order (which often happens at restaurants anyways) and the manager came over to apologize and comped that meal, even when honestly half the time I don't even realize it.
 If you are a seafood fan, don't hesitate to come here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best seafood on my 10 years of Taekwondo trips. 

How to describe it?

Authentic

Creative

No parallel

Must comeback

Worth every dip of sauce 

Don't want to leave

Definitely will come back

Don't want to fight in other state championship"}
{"text":"Eating here is more like an experience than just a meal. I had the salmon Yvette tonight, it was perfectly cooked, in a luxurious citrus sauce with crawfish and shrimp... This is definitely the best seafood dish I've had in Phoenix to date... Go to pappadeaux! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely extraordinary. Best seafood I've had in a long time. If you've ever been to Savannah this really has the feel of \"The Pirates House\".  The food, the atmosphere, the server were just sensational.  Having grown-up in MD, I consider myself a crab-cake aficionado, best I've had east of the Mississippi in 20 years."}
{"text":"Went to Pappadeuxs seafood kitchen tonight and has always had a wonderful dinner, the lobster was fabulous my son loved the fried crawfish dinner oh and his fav soup crawfish bisque cream style, this really is our favorite restaurant every experience is fabulous and our waitress Yelena (the spelling of her name may not be right so I do apologize for that) was so sweet and took great care of us we hope to see her again on our next visit which will be real soon specially when the crab finger dinner comes back ( that's my fav)
Everything about this restaurant is fabulous the food, drinks, staff, atmosphere definitely recommend. Thanks again Yelena."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since it opened. I moved away from Phoenix for a while and couldn't wait to get back to my favorite restaurant; however, this was NOT the food quality I would have ever expected from here... We had soft shell crab (which was reeeeally small, soggy and had the taste of burned, old fryer oil.)  We also had the very tasteless and disappointing, ($20)Calamari appetizer and Crawfish Etouffee (yuck). The over-priced, baby portioned Brussels sprouts were amazing, however...  The only thing that saved the evening was the amazing server, Johnny! Simply wonderful service! It is 2 days later and we are just grateful we didn't end up sick...  So sad.  What a beautiful restaurant with wonderful servers, too bad the food quality has gone so far downhill. Until Friday, this was my favorite restaurant and with the money we spend there I am almost afraid to go back."}
{"text":"I have been here many times....I keep coming back for the blue point oysters, even though sometimes they are out but I still come back in hopes I will get them eventually...lol The service is great every time, the servers are fast and always willing to go the extra mile. 
It's not really your romantic type of a restaurant, the table are very close to each other and it is very loud in there but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars is because the atmosphere inside is terrible. (too crazy, very loud, poor lighting, high traffic)

Seating outside is another story, especially in the fall. It is beautiful. The food is great and definitely exceeded my expectations. I ordered the Atlantic Salmon as I had heard it was excellent there. I've never been a big fan of salmon and have had several bad experiences with it in other restaurants. My first bite was timid, but by the end I thought I was going to start licking the crumbs off my cedar plank. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.

My dish also came with some of the largest asparagus I've had. I'm always very leery of large asparagus as it is almost always too firm. Once again, grilled to perfection just like the salmon. 

The wait staff was also very courteous and enjoyable. Overall a great experience after we had moved to the courtyard area. I highly suggest, especially if you are a fan of all you can eat lobster."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by the chain or this restaurant. After taking my folks here years ago, it became a \"must visit\" on their annual spring road trip to the Southwest. This year was no exception, even with a glitch in service.

The patio with water feature was perfect in April and we could talk at normal volume in contrast to the sometimes loud interior.

We placed two orders for grilled trout with shrimp and sauteed spinach and my mother ordered salmon with dirty rice. I got a mixed greens salad and my father got a beefsteak tomato salad with crab meat. The salads were excellent.

The fish was done just right and nicely presented. The trout plate was just the right amount, while my mother left some of the rice on her plate.

The one glitch was a mix up, missing my father's entree. As soon as the first two main courses came out, the waiter realized he had made an error. A manager showed up quickly to apologize, assure us they were fixing the problem, and offer a cup of chowder or bisque. My father took the lobster bisque and the second trout plate came out rapidly. 

In the end, the bill showed that they comped my father's whole meal! Way to make things right. Again, we had a great meal with unrushed conversation on the patio. We will certainly plan on returning here and have a strong positive view of the brand."}
{"text":"The server and staff was very accommodating and attentive. This is my third try as I have not wanted to wait an hour just to eat here. So it's after lunch hour and the crowd is gone, the pace slow and relaxing. I'm looking forward to a great experience and delicious food! 

For appetizers it was lump crab and spinach, it was tasty but no crab flavor, then I got a side of gumbo. Gumbo as I remembered it living in Louisiana and how I learned to make it was usually in a thick broth, what I got was basically a wet salty soup, so salty I stopped after the first spoonful. 

Moving on, my main course arrived, I ordered the lunch combo of blacken catfish on a bed of dirty rice and shrimp (4 pieces) creole over white rice. Again it was so salty I could not eat the catfish, my white rice along with anything supposing to resemble a vegetable was soggy. I ate 10% of what I ordered, the rest was thrown away. 

Perhaps this is the after lunch crowd quality of left over or watered down food, I'm not sure. What I am sure of, is that I will not return for the quality of food for the price point was not present. I would not return there even if they offered me my next meal at no charge.

Also surprising my server did not question the amount of food left on the plates, especially after I mentioned how salty the food was. I should have requested a refund, the other party with me also complained of the food and stopped eating citing an upset stomach. I suppose if I had an adult beverage I may have tolerated the feasting of the horrible food... good thing I do not drink."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  I've been coming here for years on my way from L.A. to Tucson and I can always expect top notch service!"}
{"text":"I had been to other Pappadeaux restaurants in the past but this was the first time at this one. It was a nice evening so we sat on the patio. There is a fountain and it is actually quite lovely. Our server was very attentive. It seems like service is a priority for this chain. We started with the crab and spinach dip. My fiancé wanted to get a big spoon at eat it like a soup it is that good! I had the soft shell crab grilled....I am a huge fan of soft shell crab and only get to have them on rare occasions. My fiancé had the creole shrimp and grits. The grits were insanely delicious. We were actually very full but the dessert presentation was done for the table next to us. What a smart couple they ordered their own desserts because they all looked and sounded so good. Their pecan sweet potato pie is one of my all time faves. So good. If you have a special occasion, I highly recommend this place. It is pricey but good seafood usually is and this will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Holy wow. Choices galore! We had catfish which was perfectly fried in a super light batter and absolutely fresh! Talapia was ok, a little dry. The crawfish were New Orleans style and perfectly seasoned. The calamari to die for! If you go you must have the cheesy grits with corn and andouille sausage! We also tried the gator, a bit on the hot side but absolutely perfection and the wedge salad was crisp, cool and loaded with bacon and blue cheese bits! All in all not a thing wrong with the food and portions are substantial! The only reason they don't score a 5 is our server, served our drinks with his fingers placed firmly around the rim of our drinking glasses and my first jameson nd tonic was served in a dirty glass (yuck). A little work on serving etiquette and this is a 5 star easy! Eat well, live well! Enjoy"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 star review because not only is the food excellent, the service was exceptional!   I've eaten here a few times and I can't review the meals I've eaten in the past and I'm sorry but my meal tonight was not seafood.  I went for their original Greek salad.  At the bar...solo.  bar help all work together, they all seem happy to be here and they are so polite and service oriented.   My salad was put together right at the bar so not only will it not get soggy in route from th kitchen, I was able to approve of everything that went into the salad.  Great experience.  Next time I will review thir Seafood meals!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually big on chain restaurants but Pappadeaux's has consistently been good at every location I've been to.  I almost always get the Crawfish Etoufee.  I'm so addicted to that stuff.  I took my husband here for his birthday on our most recent visit and mentioned it was his birthday.  Hubs got to pick out any dessert he wanted, complimentary!  I know a lot of places do this but it was also a full size dessert.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Okay came here for a birthday dinner and ohemgee it was sooo packed...that place was literally poppin. We asked for a table for 6 and they told us it was an hour and a half wait (actually ended up being 1 and 15 min) but we decided to stay coz it was worth the wait!
They have a garden patio waiting area whichbwas very pretty and lush green on a nice spring night! If I wasn't starving that wait wouldn't have been bad with company... And there's always the bar while you are waiting (21+ only tho ) got me a pina colada! Yummmyyy tasted coconuty and creamy.

We got the apetizer trio to share but substituted calamari for the salmon. The other two were the fried alligator and shrimp/crawfish fondeux. Fried alligator was interesting but good...didn't like the sauce coz it was too salty. The fondeux was good but I still prefer peeling my own crawfish than it already mixed in a sauce(its part of the fun). And the calamari was breaded and crispy yummy!

I decided to order crispy atlantic salmon with maine lobster. The waitress told me that the lobster was only abiut 2 ounces (I guess I don't know what that estimate is because when my plate came out and I saw three tiny pieces of lobster) still considering... My plate was delicious even if was the most expensive plate on the table for 33 bucks and also the smallest portion. The salmon was a good size and yummy, also came with crispy shrimp that was seasoned very well and the tiny pieces of lobster with the side of roasted acorn squash (never had this before and it is freaking delicious and buttery). Everything was delicious and worth the wait!

We got a free dessert and another one for the table to share: brownie and key lime pie...eh... But they sure were pretty!

Our server was great! Her name was Lena :) love the ambience and I think there was live music earlier but i didn't know where it was coming from. It was a great time! Can't wait to go back here!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was fair at best for the price. Mussels were sandy. Otherwise were tasty. My entree was lukewarm. My companions were hot. I ordered the crispy salmon-3 -4 new potato pieces and very woody asparagus. Drinks were slow coming out of thre bar.Waitress was doing her best. No reason to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My husband, mother, and I went to Pappadeaux's for a late lunch on Valentine's Day. We didn't realize it, but February 14th is smack dab in the middle of Mardi Gras, so Pappadeaux was quite busy! The courtyard is beautiful, though, with live music, ample seating, and this time popcorn, cheese, and sausage was being given out while you waited, along with bottled water and Mardi Gras beads. The wait was projected to be 30-45 minutes, but we were seated in 20 minutes. 

The food was delicious, as always, and the service was friendly and adequate to good. It was a very busy day, so I understand that it is difficult to keep the drinks full. I chose the Blackened Mahi Alexander Style, my husband chose the Blackened Mahi lunch special, and my mother got the Tilapia lunch special. The spices were bold and impressive. Loved the grilled shrimp with my dinner. For dessert, we got creme brûlée and pecan sweet potato pie with vanilla bean ice cream. So. Totally. Delicious. This is one of my favorite places to get creme brûlée. 

I always look forward to my lunches and dinners at Pappadeaux. I was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is just consistent. Been a fan for years and am not sure why it is not in our regular rotation. But, I have had the opportunity to lunch here the past two Fridays. Our server Audrey was fantastic as always. Try the bacon wrapped shrimp brochettes and sausage/seafood gumbo, of course."}
{"text":"I have not been to New Orleans for a while but last weekend I felt as if I were there again, WOW!! This place is great, the ambiance, the food ,the people, a cornucopia of what was to come. We started with oysters on the half shell, fresh,briny, and sooo cold I got brain freeze. I've had frog legs from Alabama to Zanesville and these were far by the best ever fall off bone croaking delicious flippers I ever had. My 1 1/2 lb. fresh Maine lobster was so sweet I did not even think twice about using the clarified butter. The claws were as big as a baseball mitt. Oh, by the way I did have the wedge lettuce with blue cheese and bacon dressing and again it was the best. The rest of our party had food fit for a king and remarked on every aspect of our dining pleasure.When ever I get a hankering for the Big Easy again this fine establishment will beckon my name, and it will be soon."}
{"text":"We returned here for dinner and had a much better experience than previously.

This time, we ordered the appetizer trio, shrimp gumbo, the fried shrimp & cajun chicken tenderloins platter, & the 2 catfish plate. We thought that the best thing on the trio platter was the shrimp & crawfish fondeaux! It was really creamy & tasted delicious with the crostini. The two other items on the plate were also worth mentioning; the hot salmon was really flavorful due to the honey mustard that it was topped with & the alligator sauce was really tasty (I've never had alligator & it wasn't for me but it was really crispy). The shrimp gumbo was interesting ... again, not for me but not bad either. Our dinner items we had ordered were good - the shrimp & chicken were both crispy & tasty, the catfish not as much but still okay.

I think that this restaurant, based on the service & food gets 3.5 stars (4 only b/c I really enjoyed the fondeaux!!). This would have been much more impressive of a restaurant if the prices were lower, but I'd leave it as an option for a once-in-a-blue-moon date night option."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! I brought my family for lunch along with some out of town guest. great food. the marti gras pasta ( shrimp, crawfish,sausage, and clams) was awesome along with the service."}
{"text":"My bestie and I came in for dinner a few weeks ago.  Everything was perfect.  The food is by far some of the best I've had in a while.  I definitely recommend the spinach and lump crab dip, the Mahi Mahi, and the creme brulee.  The ambiance is dim, lively, and very New Orleans.  Our server, LeAndrew (sp?) was perfect and made us laugh the whole time (a couple of times I'm pretty sure he didn't mean too; he was just so accommodating it made us smile).  Additionally, any staff member who walked by made sure to clear our dirty dishes and fill our only half empty waters.  Even though it is far from my Mesa home base I WILL be returning!"}
{"text":"Jose and Missy took great care of me with the most amazing blue point oysters and a Virgin spicy Bloody Mary .  This organization does not advertise, and they are always busy.  Word of mouth advertising is alive and well for this company.  I want to visit soon; I do a lot."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, we were a party of about 20 people celebrating a friends birthday. The service was good for it being an extremely busy night. I tried the surf and turf pasta, it was tasty. It was only on the lunch menu which I didn't realize, priced at $19, but I was charged  $28. The gave a really good amount of shrimp, I could have done without the sausage. Wasn't a fan. My boyfriend ordered chicken strips and fries (he doesn't like seafood). The portion was laughable, it looked like he ordered from a kids menu. Small portion, which could have been ok if they atleast plated it nicely. It's all just tossed on a small plate. I am definitely interested in going again and trying something else, I was playing it a little safe."}
{"text":"Loved the food here! A little on the pricey side, but it's not like we live on the ocean here in Phx, so that's to be expected. A big, roomy, dining area, so plenty of room for big parties, and a nice bar area to go with that. I recently celebrated my bday here and we had a party of 6, they got us right in and food was delicious. Along with the free desert they threw in for me. First time here and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour yesterday (Friday).  Food was excellent, service was spectacular, and the oysters were quite good.  The desserts looked amazing but when it came time for a slice of cheesecake we were just way too full...  Great prices for happy hour!"}
{"text":"It's a glorified and expensive Long John Silver's. Greasy fried seafood but 5 times the price."}
{"text":"Excellent Cajun seafood restaurant. Very nice and atmospheric. Nice vibe. Outstanding service. Had Mussels first. Biggest Mussels I`ve ever had. First class. Then Salmon Alexander absolutely delicious. A little pricey but absolutely worth it. Highly recommended. Shame there is not one closer to where I live in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, I always recommend. The service is good. It's our top place for birthdays and special occasion. I love the atmosphere it's so nice. My favorite dish would have to be the Pasta Mardi Gras! I get it every time! Yum!"}
{"text":"Freakin love this place! Pricey, but the food is always great and the service is exceptional. I met Alice Cooper here once too."}
{"text":"Service that went above and beyond excellent!  The food was great too. 

My father is the most high maintenance customer that ever came into a restaurant, in other words he is a huge pain in the ass. He thinks it is clever to ask for a plate of lemons, squeezes all of them into his water, adds sweet n low, and is proud he got free lemonade. He is also hyper critical of servers and demanding with no regard to everything they do. Don't even get me started on how he hits on female waitresses. Hey, I love my dad, but he is no picnic. I just wanted to give a little exposition so you would understand how fantastic the service was.

The waiter actually took the time to pay attention to my dad's unfunny comments as my mom and I cringed in embarrassment, even though I'm sure he had things to do. He made a decent wine by the glass recommendation for me, and gave me great ordering advice when I was wavering. He kept all our our drinks filled and the table cleaned as we finished things like soup and bread. We never wanted for anything from soup to dessert!

The lobster bisque was delicious, I had the Pappas Greek Salad, which was great, and prepared table side with flair. My parents split the Tilapia, which they loved, and the waiter brought them two plates without them even asking; thank God.

Since it was my mom's birthday we did dessert as well. Thank god I had soup and salad. Of course my dad had to ask for my mom's dessert to be comped in front of her since it was her birthday...classy. My mom and I both had the crème brulee, which was not the best I've ever had, but still pretty good crème brulee.

Our waiter was friendly, patient, attentive, and overall fabulous! Seriously, who knew service would be this wonderful here?  I will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Close your eyes; listen to the waves on the beach crashing, the smell of fresh shrimp in the air, the warmth of the sun massaging your complexion.  Oh wait we're not in the Bahamas, were at Pappadeaux! 

Great atmosphere, AMAZING food, and great service. Growing up in a beach house, I know fresh seafood. I'm talking fish and shrimp from water to plate in 10-20 minutes! This place is amazing! Not only did it taste fresh, but it was fresh! Either they have the ocean in their back kitchen or their transporting their product in giant fish tanks using 18 wheelers!

Great food, great people, amazing experience.

Thank's Pappadeaux's for an amazing experience with my wife."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat.  Fried alligator ROCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Blue Point oysters were excellent. Seafood platter- broiled with tilapia, stuffed shrimp, mesquite grilled shrimp and crawfish! I'd order again. Very good service and the presentation was top notch. We don't have many seafood choices in the valley and this one is just as consistent as any."}
{"text":"Happy hour is well done. Drinks and small plates. Spicy shrimp with potato and corn cob is really good"}
{"text":"Love pappadraux, we had an off dinner and the manager did everything she could to make it right . I appreciate the marking the off night right."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Pappadaux since neither of us had ever eaten there before. What a great experience! Not knowing what to expect, I was extremely pleased with the restaurant. 

We arrived with no reservations and told it would be a 20-30 minute wait but we were shown to the bar area. As I am a fan of local microbrew beer, I ordered a Four Peaks Kiltlifter My wife had her usual cup of coffee. The bartenders were happy and funny and seemed to genuinely enjoy their job. The 20-30 minute wait only lasted about 10 minutes and we were shown to our table. 

The server was extremely helpful and knowledgeable in giving us a few suggestions to try. Even going to the point of letting us know what dishes she prefers in pairing with the appetizers. Since my allergy to mushrooms can cause issues, I asked if the meal can be made without them. Absolutely she replied. What happened next is what shocked us. The person running the kitchen came over to our table to make sure it is just an ingestion allergy and not a contact. She wanted to make sure that it was OK to cook in certain pots and pans. In my 48 years, no restaurant has ever asked me that. I felt taken care of from the beginning. 

The appetizers we had were fantastic. We enjoyed the crisp fried alligator and he crawfish and shrimp fondeaux. The fondeaux was the best creamy blend of cheese and seafood I've ever had. Definitely one appetizer you must try. 

Our main courses were equally as good. I had the Pasta Mardi Gras. Normally in restaurants when you order a main dish you can finish the entire thing. Pappadeaux loads up the plate with their food. I had lunch leftovers for two days. 

All in all the meal cost us about $100 with appetizers and drinks. Not a bad price for the experience we had. The atmosphere and employees were five star all the way. Leave room for their bread pudding for dessert. It's worth it."}
{"text":"One of my fave restaurants in Dallas and so happy there is one here in this godforsaken wasteland.  If you like raw bar seafood..this is the place for you.  Their oysters are awesome (just hint..don't be swayed by the more expensive oysters..not worth it and they are smaller.  Texas gulf oysters are delicious).  This place can get expensive, but the portions are huge and splitting is recommended.  The raw bar is very very reasonable and it's where I tend to hang out.  Bakers dozen of oysters and one of their sublime Bloody Mary's is a perfect combo.  Usually get their mozzarella sticks too which are light and crunchy with a very good marinara sauce.  Salads are yummy.  I tend not to order off the menu as the appetizers are filling enough, but I have had their fish, although I don't Cajun anything..if it's a good piece of fish and cooked right, you don't need to pepper it up.  Seafood brochette over dirty rice is one of my favorites and always tons left over for like a dinner and a lunch.  Best seafood place in the valley..hands down.  Oh..and the waitstaff is top notch."}
{"text":"Wow really surprised the seafood was excellent the lobster bisque was delicious and full of lobster meat we had the Halibut Alexander style with gulf shrimp and diver scallops was delicious the soy ginger sauce with spinach really complimented the dish yum."}
{"text":"Although we waited over 75mins for our food (after placing our order), the manager made our out of state, first timer experience right. Our waitress was a delight, and I'm grateful they accepted accountability opposed to making excuses. Will return."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I've been here many times over the years. Love the majority of the food on the menu. Happy hour is great. Drinks are always perfect and strong. I strongly advise everyone to order the fried gator. The roux served with this delicious meat makes me feel that I'm in New Orleans... The only difference is the spiciness. Nothing here is as spicy as true cajun food but still very good. The reason I am only giving four stars is that i am holding back because of the cost of eating here. Two people can get in and out with a couple cocktails for $100.  We celebrated my husband's birthday here recently... all food was great however with a party of 7 our bill was $300 and three were children. I believe there were 5 alcohol beverages on the tab... but still this is just too much for my liking."}
{"text":"This place used to be good...Great even!  Going here was a treat and a family outing because it's kindof far from our house.  But for about a year now, the food has gone down hill a little bit.  the past 2 times we've been here the roux has been burnt!!!  Is anyone else picking up on this??  My Grandma who was born and raised in Louisiana and has cooked creole food for years says she thinks they've switched to pre-made roux from a jar.  Either that, or the chef doesn't know what he's doing.  When we went several months ago, she ordered a big bowl of the seafood gumbo, I ordered a small cup.  Immediately she said it tasted burnt and sent it back.  I sent back my cup as well and had the lobster bisque, which is always excellent.  We thought it was just a fluke or an off night, so when we went a couple weeks ago, she steered clear from anything with roux, but my lunch order came with a cup of seafood gumbo...Once again, it tasted burnt to me...so that was the last straw. Something is off with their roux and thats twice now, spread months apart..Maybe they HAVE switched to store bought roux...who knows. I wouldn't expect a restaurant of this caliber to do that, but something is definitely off with their roux.  If and when we go back, I'll steer clear of it and just order something else."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: for a weekend night the parking lot was beyond a nightmere...imagine the mall on Saturday December 23rd.  We actually saw a guy steal a spot and then just about get into a fist fight over it, THEY WERE OUT OF THEIR CARS PEOPLE!  FYI, with a little patience we found a great spot close to the enterance.  

For a chain....this place is AWESOME!  First of all the garden and fountains had me 100% even if the food had sucked (which it didnt).  Live music and cocktails while sitting in lush foliage with the sound of running water and the beauty of sparkling light made the 2 hour wait worth it (it was friday night, I've been told its not that bad on other days).  You pretty much HAVE to try the Spamp Thing cocktail....its the strongest bomb pop you'll ever drink.   We also sampled a strawberry peach cooler and a 'catagory 5', also fantastic.  

Our server was great.  Charles Chester  was double sat but did an awesome job of making us feel as though we were his only table.  The general atmospher is very southern bayou with dim lighting and gas lamps, pretty unique for phoenix even if it might be considered cliche.  And listen here ladies, that flickering gas light does WONDERS for the complextion!   

Alligator bites, eh....but the Lousiana Talipia I had served with green beans and spagetti squash was SOOOOOO GOOOODDD!  Plus I added a garden salad (which was huge....I actually ate very little of my meal due to this) for 2.95.  Where do you see THAT price anymore??  My dinner partners enjoyed a blackened talipia with dirty rice, fried catfish with fries, and a steak with mash potatoes and brocoli.  There was not a single complaint at our table!  

Dessert was great.  Pappadeaux has those cheesy 80's dessert trays where everything has a coat of acrylic to keep it looking fresh....I LOVE those corny presentation trays!  FYI Pappadeaux has maybe 15 options for dessert?  Pretty impressive.  As a first time visitor we were offered a dessert on the house (WOW) and choose a chocolate brownie turtle thingie which was served warm w some yumm-o vanilla ice cream.  The single slice was HUGE, even shared between the 4 of us we hardly finished it.  Somehow we were able to force it down :)  

For the price i thought the meal was a good value with plenty of fresh options.  The only think I'm dissappointed about is that Pappadeaux is not actually locally owned, although it is family owned.  It doesnt feel chain-y but I still try to avoid them as much as possible."}
{"text":"Wow!  I ordered the Louisiana Blackened Catfish topped with pecan butter and spicy pecans with dirty rice.  The fish was done just right -- succulent, moist and flavorful.  I also had the fried alligator appetizer.  The meat is tender and scrumptous.  If I can eat it, so can you.  Oh, you haven't tasted a roll until you have one from Pappadeaux's.  Hot and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   

If you're in Phoenix, be sure to make this your top restaurant visit. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Flavorful dishes!!!! Everything from their WATERMELON DRINK to the DIRTY RICE are delicious! It is a family owned and operated restaurant meaning even the trucks that deliver the seafood are employed by Pappadeaux!!!! Definitely try their BANANA PUDDING served in a mason jar!!!!!!!!! One of our favorites!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like seafood this is a must place to eat when your in Arizona going back before I leave here We ate well  and you won't break the bank Dang this shit is Real Good"}
{"text":"We went to meet some friends and had drinks while our friends finished dinner.  The server was OUTSTANDING!!!  She knew her job and did it with amazing accuracy! I have not had this kind of service since leaving Okinawa.  The place was packed but we were acknowledged immediatly and there was no issue when we joined our friends. :-)  CANNOT wait to go back for a full meal!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and great service!  First time I've been here - busy on a Wednesday evening but we were greeted and seated very promptly, had a great waiter and the food was delicious.  Huge restaurant so even though it was busy it didn't feel crowded.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our first time dining here, our waiter seemed visibly disgruntled that we only ordered a couple of cocktails, an appetizer and soup. We just wanted to check it out.

Thinking it was just a fluke, we decided to go back again a few months later, craving seafood and a taste of the south. After being seated we noticed a tray of dirty dishes in front of our table, unattended to, and waited 10 minutes before being greeted, but were happy to finally be able to order cocktails. We waited another five minutes for water to arrive at the table via server assistant, all the while (since being seated) staring at the tray of dirty dishes from another table being unattended to. After another ten minutes of waiting for cocktails we thought we should maybe get up and leave. As we were talking about this,
our waiter arrived with our drinks.  He mentioned the bar was backed up (yet, never came by our table the entire time we were waiting to let us know). We let him know we were unhappy with the wait and were just about to leave, but we decided to stay and order: crab claws and boudin as appetizers, beef filet and mahi mahi as entrees.  We waited another 25 minutes for our appetizers and a chance to order another cocktail (our waiter again didn't stop by the table).  We got a water refill by the server assistant though. You would think at this point a manager would have stopped by to check on us, but no. 

The crab claws were tasty.  The boudin, when cut open, smelled and tasted rancid however.  We were actually grossed out. When the waiter came back to ask how the food was, thankfully just a couple of minutes later, us being already irate, my date answered \"this boudin tastes like shit\".  The waiter apologized and said that he would send a manager over to take the dish away.  Really?  Can't you just get the dish away from us?

Ten minutes past as we tried to ignore a dish we didn't like the smell of and eat our crab claws. Just then, the tray of dirty dishes in front of us was cleared. Just after, the manager arrived.  Instead of having the dish taken away immediately, she held it up in front our faces, asking what we didn't like about the boudin. We mentioned the \"boudin\" smelled, and then... she tried to correct our pronunciation of \"boudin\", and mentioned some tasting notes about the dish. My partner  replied, in more colorful words, that he was born and raised in New Orleans, and that that dish was not \"boudin\". She then apologized , said she would take the dish off of our check, and left with the dish. No mention of the long wait times or dirty dishes came up from her. 

Our entrees arrived. My mahi mahi was actually delicious, as was the filet.  Our waiter was attentive in checking back on us.  The dessert tray came around, and we decided on a fudge brownie. When the brownie came out, in a reasonable time, our entree dishes and silverware were still on the table. Instead of clearing our last course and then giving us our dessert, we had to push our dirty dishes aside before they put the brownie in front us, along with new forks and spoons... then took our dirty dishes. 

We then asked for our check, looked it over and paid promptly. We couldn't help but notice though that there was no follow up visit from the manager or even an offer for dessert on the house, considering the experience. We left a 20% tip anyways. On the way out, no management or any other staff said good bye to us.

Why two stars instead of one?  You can thank the mahi mahi and filet.

Why am I so persnickety about this experience?  Because if I'm going to spend $200 on a dinner, regardless of the dining environment, I expect at the least good service, without disagreeing and negligent management.

So close to our house, but we choose to spend a couple of franklins on dinner somewhere far from here."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Best salmon ever.  Always busy so plan to wait in the bar.   Great drinks too! Enjoy your evening here"}
{"text":"Great food & service is hit or miss but overall it's very decent.  The pasta & seafood dishes are delicious everything we've tried we've been satisfied."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get fresh seafood in the Phoenix area.  This is Cajun style seafood so it is a bit spicy but that is just something unique to experience here.  The atmosphere is very romantic.  I would come back here again for sure - this is a perfect place to take your wife for her birthday or Valentine's day or something special like that.  4 out of 5 just because I'm not normally a seafood fan."}
{"text":"My son and I decided to give Pappadeaux a try -- had never dined there before.  We had Mia as our server -- she was excellent and so was the food!  Everything came out to ou specification and the food (temperature wise) was hot!  We very much enjoyed our dining experience there!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm mm mmmmmmmmmm cheese fondue and seafood gumbo! If you don't know, know you know!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite seafood places in Arizona. Has a Cajun style that is to kill for! Their fried alligator is excellent as an app! Always friendly staff . Good job. My only complaint is the wait on food - but it is well worth it"}
{"text":"I've always heard great things about this restaurant but had never gone. I decided for my 29th birthday that I would take all my family and friends here for dinner and drinks. 

The service was okay. Kids meals came out with the rest of the food but it took a while for drink refills. No big deal. Food looked very good when served. Here's the kicker.....

I became deathly ill about a week and a half after my birthday dinner. I'm talking- convulsing on the floor ill and then shitting my brains out while vomiting at the same time. I was like this for a solid week. Went to my doctor and had a lot of tests run. Spent another two weeks living feet away from the toilet because I couldn't stop crapping myself. Turns out Papadeux fed me tainted shrimp from China and I got Salmonella poisoning. I've got the report from the MCHD to prove it. Not only did I receive Salmonella from them but a lot of other people did to. I will NEVER go back nor recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"I've always had excellent service at Pappadeaux and the food is incredible. The Moroccan salmon and shrimp is a family favorite."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux sure is the real deal! Which explains the big crowd of people waiting to be seated outside. This is an eclectic restaurant that is great for any type of gathering, from a romantic date with your significant other to a big blowout birthday celebration with friends and family.

We came on a busy Friday night with no reservation, so we were given a pager. We snagged seats at the bar and started off with drinks. They have a huge selection of their own alcoholic mixed beverages. Bartenders can sure make a mean cocktail!  

If you don't mind the loud hustle and bustle, then there would be a shorter wait for an inside table. However, we loved the fun outdoor lighting and decor, so we didn't mind the extra wait. When our pager finally went off, our hostess immediately seated us at our table before a live band. I couldn't get over how charming the patio area was. 

The food is AMAZEBALLS! Please keep in mind that the portions are LARGE, especially the appetizers.

My Loves:

Sea Bass and Shrimp - My favorite dish of the night. It must have been a special, as I don't see it on the menu. It was fresh and tasty and had lovely presentation.

Coconut Shrimp - Can't go wrong with this dish. Each bite sent me to food heaven. The marmalade sauce it came with complemented it perfectly. And the shrimp was huge!

Oysters - very large and fresh and muy delicioso

My Like: 

Crispy Fried Alligators - Tasted kind of like chicken, but a little slimy. It tasted great with the Creolo sauce it came with. However, I thought it was a bit too oily and fried for me. 

This was absolutely way too much food for two people. I highly suggest going with at least a group of 4. That way you can share and try a lot more items. Pappadeaux is definitely worth trying. I cannot wait for my next visit to Phoenix, so that I can feast here again."}
{"text":"We had to go to the west side of Phoenix and that was just the excuse for another dinner at Pappadeaux.

This time we were there in the middle of the week so there was no wait for a table.  

We went the same route on the appetizers with alligator and oysters.  No sense messing with perfection.

The hubby ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  Expensive but fabulous.  I stole a couple of bites and it was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  Heavenly!

I wasn't very hungry after appetizers so I just had a bowl of Lobster Bisque.  HUGE chunks of lobster in there and so warm and satisfying.  This will be my choice from now on if I'm not feeling super hungry.  

Pappadeaux definitely has my vote as the best seafood place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Delicious Cajun food! A friend took me here for my birthday and I am definitely a fan. Great flavors and great selections. The food is slightly pricey but wonderful for the restaurant. Very memorable. :) 

I would definitely come back. I love spicy and butter and this place has a wonderful combination of both. The portions are also large so it will feel you up until you are a happy full. Service at the table is also a hundred times better than the bar so sit at the table. For Westcoasters, like myself, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I've always judged a restaurant based on the service that they give the food can be as horrible as anything but if the service is there then you got me for life this isn't Pappadeaux Pappadeaux service and food is excellent my kids gave me a gift card for Christmas for my wife and I to use and unfortunately my printer ran out of ink for the last 30 minutes between the waitress that was taking my order at the two gold counter and both of the managers assistant managers and anybody that came over we were trying to figure out what was the PIN to the gift card as my ink ran out at the last on reasonable moment to figure out what the pain was we called the customer service for the gift card I called my daughter to resend and I finally found a screenshot of it but at that that time we had locked ourselves completely out of the gift card thank you kudos to Pappadeaux's your staff the managers the waitress that took my order they caught my mail this time because of the Valiant efforts that everyone had to do the take and try and get my order together and figure out what this gift card is I am grateful deeply deeply grateful for you guys and will continue to come out here and patronize your establishment"}
{"text":"Came in at lunch for my Christmas eve clam chowder and boudin, both were excellent , as they always have been. I have tried just about every thing on the menu here , it's always been good, best alaskan king crab legs in the valley. I swear they change the menu  and the prices every few months.   Everything keeps going up, but very , very tasty food. The deserts are all good, if you have room after dinner. I love the key lime pie, not too sweet , or sour."}
{"text":"Much disappointment :(

This place has great reviews, but I am not sure why..

  1) There is poor communication and timing in the kitchen
  2) The food represented online/in yelp/on menus are grossly misrepresented
  3) Food is average
  4) Staff needs training on how to pronounce menu items
  

I came here with a group of 8.  We started by ordering the Crispy Fried Alligator, Crab Fingers (sautéed), Frog Legs, and Calamari.  The Alligator was the best thing we ate the entire meal.

The Crab Fingers were mediocre and very messy.  The Frog Legs were average, and the Calamari was sparse among a pile of deep-fried artichoke (not mentioned in the menu)

Next up was the Andouille Sausage and Seafood Gumbo, which I thought was great; enough for me to finish my cup.

We ordered meals (I got the Crawfish Etoufee).  1 person in our group got her food 20 minutes ahead of everyone else.  The rest of the group received their food by the time she finished her meal.  The guy who had my plate kept pronouncing my dish \"Ee-too-fee crawfish\" so it took a while for us to figure out what he was saying...

Halfway through our meal, another person brings an extra random dish (the same dish that the first person received).

Not a single person felt the need to finish their main course; it just didn't impress us.  The pictures on the yelp site and on their menus may have led us on a bit too much.  Thank goodness my phone can make anything look good..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying don't know if I would ever go back! 
I took my wife there for her birthday and it was really bad. We had a party of 15 people the lady's at the front desk were rude they wouldn't seat us unless we had all 15 there and they where counting and being careless I had a a family member who recently had heart surgery.  The table was ready and we only where missing two people from party. After our order was taken it took well over an hour to bring us our food. My wife order wasn't rite and the food was cold it was just really bad service.   Dont know if I could go back!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over ten years and our go to place for cajun and seafood. Prices have kept up with the times but it's still worth it to get some excellent dishes. Seafood platter and pasta mardi gras are two of our favorites. I tried the shrimp & grits today and it will be added to my list of favorites."}
{"text":"Ugh... I love Pappadeaux, but I will never understand why the service is so bad in the AZ location.  We asked to move tables and after arguing with me for a few minutes the waiter finally agreed to let us switch to a more suitable table (one with slightly less flies) ... He promptly stood back and watched me carry all of our drinks and plates to the next table.  Another server was kind enough to come from his section to help my grandmother from her seat.  Food is typically delicious, but the continued poor service leaves an awful taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"the Greek house salad....... is friggin delish!  

lots of different offerings from the sea........ lakes and rivers too!

haven't had the gumbo or etouffes...... but i hear they're pretty decent.

the most recent visit consisted of:
Greek salad
Grilled Costa Rican Tilapia Lafayette
Blackened Catfish Opelousas
Oven Baked Stuffed Tilapia

everyone was happy with their food...... but i am guaranteeing i will b gettin the blackened catfish opelousas next time!"}
{"text":"Mixed experience.  Came in on a Friday around 730.  The place was pretty busy.  Tried to make reservations over the phone earlier but were told no reservations were available.  Walked in and the hostess said 30 minutes.  Went to use the rest room and the place looked 30% empty.  Walked back out and 5 minutes later were told the table was ready.  Kind of a shaky start.

Our waitress Nancy was extremely helpful and friendly.  She went over all the specials and the whole background of Pappadeaux.  We ordered several items to share.  Calamari cajun style, crab legs, Texas redfish, and Mississippi catfish.

We waited for our food and no bread was served.  We literally ate some of the crackers on the table.  Drinks were also very slow to come out.  We received the calamari and it was okay.  Kind of small for the price and could have used more cajun spice.

Our food finally comes out after quite a wait.  The large order of crab legs consisted of about 4 legs.  We asked for them to be cut in the back and there were a couple small slits on the legs instead of them actually being cut down the middle.  We expected much more from a restaurant that accounts for 1% of the entire seafood consumed in the U.S and charged $55 bucks for 4 legs.

The Texas redfish was ridiculously flavorful.  The brown butter and wine sauce just danced all over my taste buds.  The fish was fresh, buttery, and everything went perfectly with dirty rice.  Every bite was absolutely delicious.  

The Mississippi catfish was quite dull in flavor after the Texas redfish.  It was severely lacking flavor and freshness.  We really regretted this choice.

For dessert we ordered a banana pudding to go.  It was okay.  Nothing special to really say about it.

Our bill came out to $240+.  Probably won't be back for quantity/quality vs price ratio was too much in favor of the house.  If by chance I do happen to come back I am definitely ordering the Texas redfish!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. the food and the atmosphere is absolutely great! I've had so many different meals here I cannot count them. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here and the service is great.  The atmosphere is fun and the food very flavorful.  We like to go here on special occasions and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Mm mm MMM. this place is outstanding!! Excellent food, not to mention excellent service!!! My boyfriend & I dropped a pretty penny here, not to mention our server got a great tip for being so outstanding & helpful. Super cool guy, our drinks were always full, went above & beyond explaining all the food/dessert options they had, super polite. I have nothing to complain about. Food was promptly delivered. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I go here often for lunch meetings and the Cajun style seafood is great. I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great seafood - Blue Point oysters are so fresh and you don't want to miss. The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating is ... it is pretty loud and the price range is high. The quality of the service is not consistent - either you get a super good server or lazy one. Overall, I always go home happy after visiting there :)"}
{"text":"I hope this was an isolated incident, because I really love Pappadeaux's.  It's not someplace I go regularly, rather reserved for special occasions. It's a little on the pricey side but certainly in line with the usual value they offer. The food, service and ambiance have always been top-notch and I've been saying for weeks now that it's where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner.
 
Despite the fact that they're a chain (huge in Texas and elsewhere, but only 1 single location in Phoenix), I feel like they operate like an indie and get it right on most fronts.  My favorite dish is the Crawfish Platter (a ginormous platter piled high with authentic dirty rice in the middle, flanked by breaded, fried crawfish on one side and thick, savory crawfish étouffée on the other side).

Last night's birthday dinner was unfortunately an absolute bust.  I was excited to show my boyfriend the amazing wonder of Pappadeaux's, as he'd never been there before and I'd been talking it up for weeks.  We were seated right away (which was atypical because they're always packed), but we did get an annoying end table right on the corner so there were constantly people pushing past us and bumping into my chair.  Whatever, luck of the draw, and I was happy to be seated right away.

Our server Erich came over and took our drink order.  I ordered a Coke and water.  I got Diet Coke, which tastes like poison.  Waited a few minutes trying to flag him down (admittedly this guy had at least 2 other tables he was waiting on) and I pointed that out to him and he launched into some weird back and forth about how it should be Coke.  You're tellin' me buddy, that's WHAT I ordered.  He took it away and a different server brought me a regular Coke with a smile.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Then Erich returned and babbled awkwardly about the mishap. It's fine. This happens a lot. Most people drink Diet Poison - I get it.   He took our orders and said he'd be back with some bread.

The bread and butter was dropped off pretty quickly, which is when we realized we had no set-ups.  It's kinda hard to spread butter on your bread without a knife.   We waited a few more minutes looking for him to flag him down again.  He grabbed set-ups for us and said something about \"I wish we could assure that all tables could have set-ups when they're bussed but that's nearly impossible...\"  Ok, whatever, I just want utensils and a napkin.  Thank you.

The food this time was OK.  Normally it's stellar. Maybe I was already annoyed by what I considered \"Strike 1\" and \"Strike 2\".  Both crawfish entrées were great.  The dirty rice was definitely subpar --undercooked and very dried out/chewy.   Erich asked us if we needed anything. I asked for an extra tartar sauce and a spoon for my étouffée.  He brought them right over.  At that point, at the beginning of the meal my Coke was still full. Like most people, I drank it intermittently while I chewed and ate and it was soon gone, but I still had half a plate of food to eat.  No sign of Erich.  No Coke in my glass. So I just continued eating and finished my plate.
  
At the end of the meal, Erich re-appeared and asked if we needed anything.  My other half motioned at my glass but at that point my food was gone and I just wanted to leave.  Erich then realized that maybe I wanted a refill and asked if I did. I said don't worry about it and asked for the check.  Then we waited some more.  The check came and I swear to you the fastest thing I saw the waiter do all night was process the check and get us out of there.

What bugged me was that I could see many other tables around us being served and having a great time with their servers, lots of smiles, hospitality and ambiance. I felt like we got the shaft.

I have to say that in the past I've always had impeccable service, amazingly fresh food and a top-notch experience at Pappadeaux's.  Perhaps this was an off night.  Perhaps Erich had too many tables.  Perhaps we shouldn't have even left him 10% gratuity.  Three dings on service, one on food and one on the crappy table.  I'll have to think long and hard before spending my money there again."}
{"text":"$6 for a dozen Texas Gulf oysters Mon-Thur.  We ordered 8.
Waitress was slick and upsold us on alligator, which contrary to popular belief, does not taste like chicken.  Get the spinach dip with real crab meat - it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent food. but really expensive  great happy hour. Their fried shrimp is to die for. But their catfish is soso.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Second time I've been at Pappadeaux's and it was good food. They give you a roll of bread to eat that is free. The bread is rock hard and it feels like it will break a tooth. They should definitely invest in a different bread recipe, I like soft bread! I ordered the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and it costs 10 dollars. The shrimp cocktail tastes good but it is very small in portion and not worth the money! The waiter recommended a jumbalya type of dish and it was around 23 dollars. It was big in portion and tasted good. My fiance got filet Mignon and she said it tasted good except the sauce wasn't very good. She asked for a salad to substitute the asparagus and the waiter said he couldn't. The asparagus comes the size of tree trunks lol. The bill totaled about 70 for two people. I would say that the food tastes good but it is over priced. The waiting staff was very good as well. The reason for the 3 stars is the over priced food."}
{"text":"Cris R guest relations manager here is my mailing address for my post on Yelp 
I would of gave them less if I could. My co-workers and I went to this location through word of mouth. We ordered the Crab crusted Mac-Cheese it was so bland I couldn't eat it. We also ordered the Seafood Platter this was good quite a bit of food cool. Here is where the one came in for a referral. We got ready to leave the waiter Eddie offered us the desert off of the try. We were full and decided to get the banana pudding. Eddie swore by it saying it was made fresh everyday. Well here is this mess that they call freshly made the bananas were spoiled in the jar the cookies were extra mushy and the pudding was gritty. We drove from the Radisson on 44th by the airport which in traffic took us almost 40 minutes. We were so disappointed if they were close We would of drove back. Don't order desert. Or the Mac n Cheese"}
{"text":"I've only ordered one thing from here and it was the fried shrimp. I love it! It's spicy and crunchy mmm! I have tried the fried alligator once though. The flavor wasn't bad, I just don't like the texture of alligator. At least I tried!

The price is very expensive BUT they give you a good amount of food so it makes up for it. 

The staff is very nice especially Nora! She's the best!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad. The food was overall very good although there were some things that weren't the greatest. I got oysters and the alligator for appetizers. The oysters were probably the best I've ever had and the alligator was amazing! Not at all tough. Although on the menu it only lists the alligator as fried, they also serve it blackened which I totally recommend. They let us have half and half. Then for my main dish I got the Costa Rican Mahi Alexander. Although I only wanted the smaller portion, I forgot to say so, so I was given the larger and paid more than I expected. It was overall a very good dish though my scallops were a bit undercooked and my shrimp were a bit over. Over all a very good experience. I wouldn't mind going again but I wouldn't go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, loved the blackened fish w/red beans and rice.  The blackened alligator is also very good.  Our waiter was named Matt and he was excellent with his service and really knew the menu and gave options on how things could be prepared or changed.  Top notch service!"}
{"text":"I love  good food and Pappadeaux's never disappoints! I would like to thank our server Nick for such great customer and the manager Arizania ! They were super busy but they made me and the birthday boy feel as though we were the only ones there!
To the rest of the staff you all are awesome great staff it was my boyfriends first time there and he wants to come back! Thank you for making this such a special night!"}
{"text":"I admit that growing up in a coastal Atlantic town where we caught our own crabs and fish, it's a very high bar to scale.

I have eaten here twice. The first time I had as a appetizer the Oysters Pappadeaux, a variant of Oysters Rockefeller.  I had to send them back- they were way way way too salty.  For an entree I had a fish and pasta dish, it was okay, but not spectacular.

Today I was someone else's guest, but I got to pick the restaurant. June is the time of year when blue claw crabs molt, and when soft shell crabs are available fresh.  Since I saute them when I cook them when back east, I ordered the pan grilled and not the deep fried softshell dinner plate with three crabs.

Traditionally the lungs are removed,  the eyes and \"face\" of the crab removed, and the rest left intact.  There are also strict rules regarding harvesting of crabs, that their top shell must be a minimal length from point to point.  These softshells had the tops completely removed. The actual bodies of the crabs were grossly undersized, and I mean grossly. One of my three crabs had a body that was only an inch wide. 

I don't know if Pappadeaux has crab farms where they raise them, and then segregate them at molting time, or if they are wild harvested.  If they are wild harvested then the crabs served to me were hardly legal, unless they were not from the Atlantic coast.  On top of that, a crab has saline liquid inside of it, so there is no need to put a salt laden coating on the crab before grilling, but Pappadeaux seems to salt them. Eating the crabs was like eating mouthfuls of salt. Had I been the one paying for the meal as I was the first time I ate there, I would have sent them back.

In the future I have decided it is better to wait until I am visiting a coastal area to eat seafood that is brought to market from boats moored at local docks.  The flown in seafood at Pappadeaux has failed to impress me.

The waitstaff was professional, prompt and  friendly. Pity the food does not live up to the servers."}
{"text":"Horrible hostess service prevented us from eating at all. We were told it was a 45-60 minute wait. After waiting patiently for more than one hour, we were told there were three 5-top tables in front of us and it would be at least 30 more minutes. No apology or accommodation was offered. No restaurant is worth that brain damage."}
{"text":"This is definitely the go to place for seafood in Phoenix. That said, I don't really like fish that much so I didn't really know what to order. I got the blackened catfish because I figure that is a staple in this type of eatery and it was pretty good for what I ordered. I definitely would go for the shellfish though, they've got some great deals during happy hour."}
{"text":"All I ended up getting was the Seafood gumbo and a caesar salad. Both of them were good. The service was excellent. I think the gumbo could have been seasoned more. I didn't try any of their specialties. I was tired from sitting in the airport all day, a little hot, and jet-lagged, but I am definitely going to go back (and update my review). Be prepared to spend some money because they are definitely pricey."}
{"text":"Louisiana born Hubby decided he wanted to go to Pappadeaux's for his birthday dinner after we discovered that Barrio Cafe would be closed Monday. The restaurant was unbelievably packed for a random Monday, but I was a tad annoyed that we still had to wait about a half hour to be seated- and that was with a reservation. 

Our waitress was great and got Hubby's requisite Oyster, Crawfish, and Mushroom \"Fondeaux\" started right away. That kind of chain-y cutesy naming cheesiness makes me roll my eyes, but Hubby is blind to such lameness since Pappa's has a whole empire of similarly named restaurants in Texas (from where he moved to Arcosanti whence I snagged him- but I digress). He also ordered some kind of layered frozen fruity monstrosity that made him positively loopy (in his defense, we're not big drinkers).

After the Fondeaux appetizer, we barely had room for our entrees, so we both have excellent lunches today. I had a mixed seafood grill which had very nicely cooked pieces of scallop, mahi, and salmon together with way too well done shrimp. In apparently some sort of fugue state I also ordered a side of onion rings which I promptly regretted when the platter came out bigger than my head. They were mighty tasty, though, and I have not had much luck before finding really good onion rings (except at Ted's Hot Dogs, of course). Hubby ordered a crawfish platter with fried pieces and etoufee, but the waitress  convinced him to get the triple slam with blackened crawfish as well- and this turned out to be his favorite on the plate. All the portions are gargantuan, so we have to remember next time to share an entree, especially if we need to get the Fondeaux. Which I'm sure we will..."}
{"text":"The food was very good, but overpriced. The out door area is beautiful! The service unfortunately was not so great. Everything seemed to take forever!!!! Not sure if that was our waiter or the kitchen, we were surprised he hadn't put our daughters dessert in when we asked while we were about done with our entrées. The time delay ended in us not trying dessert and cancelling hers simply because we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes just for that too."}
{"text":"My first visit to Pappadeaux was in Houston in the early 80's. Living in the dessert now I miss the great tasting flavors of living on the Gulf Coast and then some. This is the place we migrate to when we are looking for a that type of feel good food.

Both outside and inside is fixed up so that you feel like you are in New Orleans or nearby. Service is exceptionable. Just let them know what you need and / or want and they will make it happen. Grandpa Mark says so. Trust me!

Food is always very good and tasty. We like to start off with a  large portion of fried alligator with an extra side of their special Creole dipping sauce. The complimentary French Bead with butter definitely take it to the next level. Dip Me Baby!

Some of our favorites are anything deep fried of coarse, the blackened fish, all the items they grill, as well as the gumbos, salads, all the etouffees dishes and the dirty rice. Tally ho! The menu is just too big to go over it all.  Yummo!

Last visit with the extended family we ordered the Ginger Salmon, Blackened Mahi, Blackened Catfish. Sampler Seafood Platter, Shrimp and Catfish, and of course some Alligator to get things rolling.

Mention a special occasion like a B-Day celebration for an extra special treat. Hmmm? 

This is not a Long John's Pete's type fish place so prepare to enjoy. Place gets really busy and loud at peak times. Recommend going there for an early lunch to get the extra attention. 

Mr. Mark ........ table ready.

Ah-YEE!"}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary on a Friday Night. There was a very large crowd and a thirty minute wait. We decided to stay, and boy was I glad we did. They had a live band playing in a very nice court yard with water features and seating outside. The cocktails were very good. I started with a dozen oysters, they were excellent. I also had the Filet Mignon and grilled lobster tail. It was beyond words. The service was excellent. A little pricey our tab was over $300  for a party of three. I would go again. It is a very fun environment and very loud, so if you are looking for a quiet romantic place, not so much."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place that served oysters so I looked up best oysters in Phoenix area and on the top of the list was Pappadeaux.. so we decided to try it. From the moment we walked in we had great service from the hostess to our waiter Sam. The manager even came by when she heard it was our first time there. Sam is a great server, very attentive to our requests , very helpful in describing the different dishes they serve & believe me they have a very big list of things to choose from. he food was delicious and plentiful. We tried the gator tail , which i've eaten before in other places. It was so good. The raw oysters are superb and I decided to have fried oysters. I grew up in Fl and grew up eating them so I was hoping they'd be good. They were ! My husband got the crawfish etouffee which he loved. the manager even had us pick out a dessert to take home, on the house. We were way too full to have it there. The dishes are more than enough , you won't go home hungry. The atmosphere is great, very nice looking place. We most definitely will be adding this place as a favorite to eat."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the customer service was great the drinks OUTSTANDING & VERY REFRESHING . Quickly became one of my favorite spots"}
{"text":"The food was good even though by steak was overcooked AZ for medium-rare and I got well done not the way I really like to eat my steak but I went with my wife for our anniversary little expensive but the meal was good"}
{"text":"OMG the alligator tail appetizer, and probably some fo the best salmon and craw fish etouffe I have ever experienced!"}
{"text":"The sea food was fresh and Samuel was an excellent waiter, however I have NEVER tasted such salty food in my life. I debated sending it back but decided to tough it out. I don't think it could have been any more salty if someone had purposely tried to over do it.  The prices also rather shocked me but I knew it would be expensive to have fresh seafood in the desert. Almost all entrées start at about $30 and go up from there. And then there is exorbitant up selling of salads and side dishes. Also be prepared for extreme noise levels during dinner. This was my last dining experience here.  I don't wish to overpay AND get hyper-tension."}
{"text":"my dad took us here for my mom's birthday -- one of the best seafood restaurants i've been to! prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service you receive. also, complimentary choice of dessert on your birthday. great place!"}
{"text":"I know you wouldn't be thinking of eating seafood in AZ, but if you are around you gotta try it out. Back in the day when home-base was Pheonix I would frequent this place, it was pretty much my religion. Pappadeaux is some of the most amazing cajun food you will ever experience. Why 4 and not 5 stars you ask? Well, I went home to visit the family and came to eat and wasn't too impressed since things seemed to have changed, sad but not overly sad.

I always get the crawfish, always always. Always perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. Crawfish etouffee is amazing, tastes like a million bucks. Appetizers like calamari and fried allligator are pretty normal, nothing special. Don't miss out on dessert, the dessert trio lets you try a little bit of everything. A++"}
{"text":"I'm allergic to seafood/fish. So I could very well be disqualified for reviewing this restaurant. However! And its a big however! They have the yummiest banana pudding this side of the Mason-Dixon line! Where is that by the way??!! LOL! Seriously, it comes served in a Mason jar and if you don't finish it all ( I never do), they give you the lid to close it up and take it home! I guess I could share it....but noooo!!

{"text":"Great food, fast food service to the table, the wait time was long to get a table, but the hostess's attitude was the real mood killer. When I first checked in I was told it was a 45 minuet wait time by the hostess and that was fine since it was a Saturday night and I expected a wait. After about an hour I went to ask how much longer it would be and the hostess was kind enough to tell me it had only been 58 minuets and she said it was going to be an hour so we needed to step back and continue to wait. I told her she said it would be 45 minuets when we checked in and she told me she would have never told me 45 minuets and we had only been waiting 58 minuets so she would get to us when there was a table open and there was 3 parties ahead of us. I stepped out of the way and they called up the first party they were seating. I didn't want to go far if they were going to call us soon. They called up and sat 4 more parties in the the next 15 or so minuets I was standing there. By that time my girlfriend was getting visibly upset, so thank goodness they seated us right after that. In the end it wasn't the long wait, I get that it was a Saturday evening and very busy, it was the hostess that had to be so condescending telling me we had only been waiting for 58 minuets, not a full 60, and implying to me that I was either wrong/lying/or I didn't listen to her say 45 minuets when I checked in. In all honesty the food was great and the desserts were amazing. We even ordered extra desserts so we could give the babysitter one. It's definitely on the higher end of mid range restaurants but well worth it if you love sea food. Also I recommend just ordering a few appetizers if it's just you and a date because the portions are really big. I really wanted to give more stars."}
{"text":"We had the best server I have had in a very long time, thank you so much Brandon for the best service for me and my fiances birthdays! Great service, great food this place is my new regular seafood restaurant spot forever! We had the best gulf Coast Oysters, the crispest alligator and amazing jumbo crab cakes! So glad my parents referred us to this place. And don't even get me started on the Creme Brule ! I work in the restaurant industry and it's rare to have my standards met and damn did this place do an amazing job. Yah.. boo hoo we had to wait 10 mins with a reservation but it was so worth it even the bread was amazing!"}
{"text":"I've had multiple poor experiences here. First, this place is always busy and has terrible parking. Every time I've gone, I've had to circle the parking lot looking for a spot. Because it's so busy, the service is terrible too. They're always busy. You have to wait to get a table, even with a reservation, then wait for a long time for them to take your order.
The last time my family went, the staff was VERY apologetic so maybe our experience was unique. We counted and they apologized to us 10 different times. 
I concede that the waiting may be due in large part to going during popular nights (Friday and Saturday) and that this is a VERY popular restaurant but I didn't find any of it worthwhile.  I love seafood, but I really didn't think the food was very good, honestly."}
{"text":"Aarrgghh! I feel like a Pirate inside the restaurant. I love the atmosphere! 
It is not my first time but I thought it was time for me to give a review. I asked to go for my birthday. Did not disappoint as usual. 
The hot loaf of bread with butter is always a good start to get my taste buds going. Of course, I fill up too much on it to get to dessert. 
My hubby and I normally start with a dozen of raw oysters and they have been consistently fresh and briny. Then we have a few appetizers as our meal. The frog legs have been great and have a light spicy kick. The Fried calamari is light, crunchy and not over fried (like the addition of the artichoke hearts mixed in with the calamari). 
This time I had the Costa Rican Tilapia Lafayette. It was perfectly done (I hate over cooked fish) and the sauce was plate lickin' good. My hubby had the Pasta Mardi Gras and he gave it the thumbs up. I gave it a taste and it was very flavorful with the Andouille sausage and in a very rich cream sauce. 
We'll be back soon so I can try more items off the large menu!"}
{"text":"I love patio dining.  This place provides a very large patio dining and would be good for small parties. The food was good and next time I will try the oysters. The banana pudding in the mason jar (lid provided for taking leftover) was very tasty and not overly sweet. It tasted like homemade pudding. Yum"}
{"text":"I would like to share an update with my fellow Yelpers.  After making my initial review I was contacted by Guest Relations and was offered the opportunity to return to give it a second try.  The General Manager stepped in and that was honorable of Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen to right a wrong and offer an apology for the service that was provided.  I was also given a gift card as a token of respect as a customer (the amount doesn't matter) and I will choose to give it another chance, which is why I have given them another star for the effort.  The food has always been decent when I've visited on other occasions, so let's hope that I can add some more stars the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Pretty. Busy. Too expensive for what you get. Ordered an amaretto on the rocks & got a glass full of ice with barely enough amaretto to wet my palette. All of the food is A la carte which,  if it's served family style makes sense but, for the price of 1 baked potato you can buy 10 lbs. Our friend's ordered the oysters & they were undercooked, which can be dangerous.  The cheese grits, However, we're excellent.  In a small town perhaps I could understand the popularity of this restaurant but, in a city like Phoenix there are too many other restaurants with the same type food for less money & better food. No need to return."}
{"text":"Great seafood for a reasonable price! The waitstaff is always prompt and the ambiance is always welcoming!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Absolutely delicious. Its loud when it's busy so something to take into consideration. If you want an intimate setting or in our case we had my older parents with us, we couldn't carry on a conversation it was so loud."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Seafood and this place is amazing!!! The freshness of all the food really shines through. The atmosphere is casual with a fine dining feel.  Prices are pretty  reasonable especially for what you get.  I had no problem paying $150 plus tip for a family of 4.  Even the kiddie meals were outstanding and they aren't shy on the portion sizes......This will definitely be my go to place when in need of supremely fresh seafood and steaks!!!"}
{"text":"If Papadeauxs were a person, it would be a large, well dressed, garish Rolex wearing pompous ass of a man who talks big and has little in the way of substance. Think, well, Donald Trump. Yes, this place is \"the Donald\" of rip off dining!!!
The service was excellent. Marcus was friendly and most professional. But the food sucked. I tell you it was pitiful for the value. The martini glass was literally just half full. Pathetic. They should be ashamed of themselves, and for $10 per drink.  
Granted, Im a Louisianan, thus a tough critic on any pseudo LA house beyond my home state. That said, I tasted the gumbo: watery, huge chunks of celery sparse proteins and just truly a joke. Campbells in the can puts this stuff to shame. 
I opted for the halibut. Previously frozen, the piece was tough and the sauce devoid of flavor other than that of the overwhelming tablespoon of huge capers atop it. 
In sum, Papadeauxs is a hands down sad imposter of Louisiana cuisine and so overtly overpriced its simply comical. 
I had the halibut ($33), two puny martinis and a shrimp cocktail, the high spot of the meal, but whats is that, Ketchup and horseradish? Really??  My tab was $72.00!! Highway robbery. Do yourself a favor and head to Texas Roadhouse for a steak or Red Lobster if you must have seafood outside the state of Louisiana. Save the difference a few times then take a nice vaca to the Big Easy, treat yourself to Commanders Palace or Galitiores in the French Quarter. Your check will be identical but your meal superlative in every way."}
{"text":"I had the Red Snapper with squash topped with brown butter tonight. It was FANTASTIC. I expected it to be good but this was beyond good. Thank you for the excellent service, Chad. You are also a delight tonight."}
{"text":"I love this place! Service is great from the door greater to the waiters. The  food here  is delicious.  I've  tasted all their plates made with Mahi Mahi. Have the alligator  or frog legs appetizer next time you stop by if you're not in the mood for trying something new try the calamari. You can not leave without having desert they are all good."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food and great service.   I got the pan seared tilapia and it was perfect in every way.  It had a brown butter sauce that was amazing and was topped with crab meat and grilled shrimp...so delicious!  Even the green beans were cooked to perfection.  My dinner partner had the redfish and it was also wonderful.   Huge portions too..no scrimping here.  Our waiter Kyle was great too.  We look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Ya know, I just kinda get Pappadeaux. Is it exquisite? No. Is it fancy? No. Is it really really good and consistent? Yes. The food is always spot on. It is as fresh as it can be in Phoenix. I have yet to find anyplace as consistently good as Pappadeaux. It is not cheap but quality seafood never is. Party of 5 with 1 child 300.00 with gratuity. We ate really well. My two favorites are Shrimp Po Boy and Shrimp Etouffe for meals. Alligator is very very good, so is the lobster bisque and the oysters on the half shell. I don't know how else to say it other than I personally totally get it and I love the fact that I do."}
{"text":"I like seafood just like I love other foods I wouldn't prefer it over any other food so I'm not obsessed with seafood but but I eat it and love it. So I wouldn't be able to tell you how great or not great or fresh something is. I went with a friend that is a sea food person and says that this is the freshest you will get in Phoenix. The food is sometimes heavy but still delicious. It's southern food and people go here to get that Louisiana type of taste."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant last night and noticed that the prices have gone way up, so I had settled for expensive plate of simple chicken when my husband and I noticed that a small roach-like bug was crawling up the wall behind us. We were seated just on the other side of the kitchen, right below the window to look inside of it. We told our server who got the manager. He said \"oh it's just a stink bug\" and grabbed it with a tissue and threw it away. We asked for a new table and he went to find a new one. While he was gone (about 3 minutes) another critter started crawling up the wall and went right under the wood by the window into the kitchen area. At that point we just left. It was really disgusting. We have always loved their food, but I think it's going to be a very long time before we can go back there and we will not recommend this place to anybody again."}
{"text":"We have been to several Pappadeaux and have always enjoyed the food and experience. The one in Phoenix was no exception. Great atmosphere, service and food. My only complaint was I ate too much but that was my doing because it was so good."}
{"text":"Last night was the worst experience I've ever had at a Pappas establishment. I've eaten at all of them but the service and timing last evening was horrible. I waited 1.5 hours to be seated then after 45 minutes waiting for the appetizer the manager came over and pretty much said he would take care of us. Well that did. It happen either. We paid full price for horrible service. The food was great but my two year old grand son just did not have the patients to be there 3 hours. Please reach out if you care."}
{"text":"Audrey B is AMAZING!!! Came here the other night for my birthday dinner with my father and brother and was served by one of the best waitresses ever. She was very kind, funny, sat us at a great table and just made my overall experience the best it could be. She got our drinks to us very fast, got our appetizers to us fast and did a great job on upselling us to a great choice of another appetizers. She never missed a beat when we needed something at our table. Never had to wait for our food or drinks, always had something in front of us. 

The food was great but the service Audrey B gave was fantastic."}
{"text":"Best and freshest seafood in AZ! Flown in fresh daily. All appetizers and entrees were delicious! From alligator to oysters to crawfish and more... Desserts are true \"Nawlins\" style! Bourbon sauce on bread pudding... OMG!!! Oversized and yummy créme brûlée ... I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Pappadeaux ended up making for a great night out! 

Given it was $6.95 for a dozen Gulf Coast Oysters, my girlfriend and I did have to wait for about 30 minutes until we were seated. However after that wait, we were seated and quickly assisted by a kind waitress, who's name is passing me right now. She was a great waitress given she was attentive but not overbearing. 

My girlfriend and I ordered the Gulf Coast Oysters as a starter and we're pleased with them. They came with horseradish, lemon, and a soy sauce garlic type of sauce. After scarfing those down, I ordered a bowl of Scrimp Gumbo and my girlfriend order mussels. The gumbo was good, but the broth had an abnormal flavor that I wasn't accustomed to. The mussels; however, were excellent. They were in a white-wine garlic sauce that was topped with parsley and lemon. For dessert we thoroughly enjoyed and shared a glazed creme brûlée with berries, that was also excellent. Through and through, with an exception of the gumbo, the food was 5-Star. 

Shortly, the atmosphere was similar to an average creole restaurant. Given the Cubs were playing the Indians, the bar was packed and quite loud. The fun laughed and formally dresser servers makes for a romantic atmosphere. 

With all of this being said, Pappadeaux is a great place to eat at for creole and seafood. 

4.35 Stars."}
{"text":"This place is a little more fancy than I expected....decor and atmosphere-wise...I thought it would be plain and simple like Red Lobster but actually the place has a very southern homey feeling to it.....although a seafood place they had like deer heads hanging and other sorts of weird decor. 
 
Came here for dinner yesterday night with my bf and his apartment-mate...we got a table right away but even for a weekday they were still half a full house. The first thing I saw on their menu was the Crispy Alligator appetizer. ALLIGATOR! ooooh but then I wanted to try their oyster appetizers cause they sound good too....ahhhhhh their menu is full of yummy choices! It was difficult deciding what I wanted to get...but after much debate....my bf and I decided to order the Oyster Duo appetizer and share the Pappadeaux Platter -- which is an amazing sample platter of all the fried variety they offer on the fried seafood section of their menu. 

So the Oysters Duo -- comes with 3 oysters on half shell baked with a parmesan romano cheese sauce and 3 oysters on half shell topped with crabmeat, spinach and drizzled with Hollandaise sauce. -- oooh they were both delicious however I recommend the later one more just cause it's very unique to this restaurant. I got to also try a few pieces of the Crispy Fried Alligator from our friend's Appetizer Trio Platter - It was pretty good actually tastes like chicken...but surprisingly more tender - I was thinking alligator meat would be tough and rough but not at all....I wouldn't have known it's alligator meat if you didn't tell me. But now I can say I have had alligator meat!

The Pappadeaux Platter was pretty good - everything is well  -- fried! However I like the blue crab cake the most, the mini fried crawfish (kind of like popcorn shrimp) is second best however I have to say that the fried Tilapia was a disappointment because it was sadly bland and really dry...it was the only thing I didn't like on the platter. but everything else was good. - - I even tried their watermelon lemonade and it was super refreshing!

I was really excited for dessert cause I saw them carrying around a platter of sample of the desserts that they have...so when we were ready for dessert I was excited to see the dessert platter - unfortunately there was nothing on the dessert platter I wanted because they all looked really rich and sweet....such as their sweet potato pecan pie, key lime pie, praline cheesecake, praline bread pudding souffle or turtle fudge brownie was just too much even for the eyes..lol They were also massive in portions so I decided not to have any. 

The service was really good, our waitress was pretty quick and friendly. Overall I enjoyed the most of the food (except the fried tilapia) and the service is good so it earned it's four stars. :)"}
{"text":"Since I was in AZ area for the weekend with my gf for pleasure we decided to visit one of my friends in the area. She picked this place and we decided to get seafood instead of steak or a meat house. 

First of all, I'd suggest making reservations otherwise DO NOT COME HERE. We showed up at 7pm but weren't seated until 845. Good thing we ate a really good lunch otherwise I'd be starving and complaining like a baby. At least this gave us time to have a few drinks before dinner in the LARGE outdoor waiting patio area. I think it was so crowded because it was the weekend before Fat Tuesday. This place kinda reminds me of Bubba Gump or something similar. It seems fun and they do have a large bar and waiting area. 

We ordered alligator and frog legs as an appetizer. LOVED IT!!! We wanted the fried alligator and frog legs but the waiter absolutely loved that he worked here and HIGHLY recommended that we order it grilled instead. Since he worked here, we figured why not? I was thinking to myself that the cooks were a bit lazy and maybe they didn't want to prepare it. Lol. To my surprise, it was good as he mentioned. I have had both before but not for a few years so I was pleased. My gf ordered the crab stuffed shrimp which was really good. I ordered a  combination seafood plate which was good but not great. 

There are way too many things to order on the menu. A lot of fried food so if you are trying to watch your diet/weight then don't come here. 

I would definitely come here again but I wouldn't be in any rush. Great for a lot of people and groups, but PLEASE make RESERVATIONS."}
{"text":"My Favorite in Dallas

This is my favorite restaurant to visit when I'm in Dallas.  I haven't made that trip in awhile, so was eager to come to this one.  The building layout is the same and the food is just as good.  Be ready to pay some $$ as it is not cheap.  $90 for two people."}
{"text":"Last time i was able to visit papadeauxs for dinner (excuse my spelling) my experience was less than stellar at one of the Georgia locations. This time around this location knocked me off my feet with the quality of food and service for their carry out orders. While in phoenix to celebrate my friends wedding. I didn't have enough time to dine in so i opted to carry against my usual notions that carry outs are never as good as dining in. Well, I would like to thank papadeuaxs for changing my mind because my carry out meal was phenomenal. It was just as fresh and delicious as if i would have dined in. The portion size and quality was not skimmed on. The food was still hot when I made it back to my fathers home which was about 30 minutes away from this location.  You can tell that this location puts pride into every dish they serve out their kitchen!"}
{"text":"We went here for father's day. The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, about a 20 minute wait so we took seats at the bar which was open. It was nice to see that the bar offered full service and had the wait been longer we might have entertained the though of sitting at the bar but there is limited space and we weren't sure how big the servings were, the plates, etc. So we grabbed a few beers and waited. They do have Turbodog on tap which I had never heard of before then. The bartender offered me a sample and I really enjoyed it. We weren't up at the bar long and our pager went off. We had to cash out there which is customary and we headed to our seat.

Our waitress was very friendly. We already had beers so she didn't need to get us drinks and we already knew what we wanted for appetizers so we ordered right away the and appetizers came out pretty quickly. We had the oysters Baton Rouge were fantastic to be honest with you. No complaints at all there. 

For our main dishes I ordered the Jumbo Shrimp Brochette and Brandi ordered the Crawfish Platter which includes fried crawfish and crawfish etouffee. Each dish was 23.95 and neither dish was worth it. The jumbo shrimp was flavorless. All you could taste was the bacon. You could have served me straight bacon for 5 bucks and it would have tasted the same. The jalapeno rice that came with it was good though. the fried portion of the crawfish platter was plentiful and very good but the etouffee was bland. 

On top of that we never got any bread until the meal came out and here's the kicker on that. It took an HOUR for the meal to come out. Keep in mind they weren't even really that busy. We had 3 tables sit down around us afterwards and all three got their food before us. And the thing is the waitress was oblivious. We had to track her down in order to inquire about our food. I feel it is part of her responsibility to know that we are sitting there for an hour without food. She said she would get a manager right on it. and when we did get the food it was brought by a manager to us but he never once acknowledged us or said he was sorry for the wait or anything. Didn't ask if we needed anything else either. Came, dropped our food off and split. To be honest with you I expected the food to be cold as if it was sitting somewhere forgotten about but it wasn't. Seemed fresh which makes me think the order never was put in and when it was they made it immediately. 

For me to go to a place to eat and drop 100 bucks I expect better food than what I got and I definitely expect better service. 

I was extremely disappointed in this visit."}
{"text":"My family and I love to get together and have a big dinner here when we can all plan it on the same night! The last time I ate here was about a year ago and since then I have converted to eating a vegan diet. I wasn't too worried because I saw someone's review that they had a pasta and it was really good. When we got there I asked Kami, our waitress, if I could just get a plain pasta with marinara and some steamed or roasted vegetables and she was very knowledgable on how the food was prepared and made sure there was no butter or dairy anywhere near my plate, which after having some bad experiences, I am SUPER grateful for. She was so sweet and she made sure I was happy with everything that came out. We also had an incident where someone's lobster wasn't fully cooked. It came out of the shell still clear and Kami had no problem taking it back to see what she could do for us. Half of the lobster was eaten and was pretty much cooked, it was really just one claw that didn't get fully cooked and the manager at the time Drew was so sweet as she brought back the claw fully cooked and told us that the whole lobster was on the house and that she was extremely sorry for the undercooked lobster. That was really amazing because you just don't get service like that anymore. I can't remember the last time that I had to send food back and the manager actually comes out, let alone takes the dish off the bill.

Always 5 stars and a great time. They are even open until midnight on Fridays! But it is true that they don't bring breadsticks out unless you ask for them."}
{"text":"I took my son here for Valentine's Day because he loves seafood. I actually hate it. Anyways, I like that they do have other options here for those like myself who don't like seafood. We ordered the lobster and fillet. Since, I don't eat seafood and my son is five, I asked if they could take the lobster meat out of the tail because well, clearly I sure as heck don't know what I'm doing with that. I was really appreciative that they were able to handle that for us so that my son could eat his lobster. Their dessert was delicious! We ate so much we left so full we couldn't breathe. First world problems."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Pappadeaux...Went on a Saturday night in JUNE; seated right away; hostess/manager came by to say our server just had a \"7 top\" and was taking their order; and would be there to get our order.  It took over 15 minutes to get our drink order; because none of the wait staff or management told our server that we were seated behind a wooden support beam.  We didn't even get water; not good...But after our server saw us he apologized for the delay; and the meal was great from that moment on; the food & drinks were great.  Our server after the rocky start; was one of the best I ever had at any establishment."}
{"text":"This place is always packed so my husband made a reservation to avoid the wait.  This was our 1st visit and the food and service was great.  I ordered the Caribbean lobster tail and he got the deep fried shrimp & chicken.  He mistakenly ordered a large portion which he couldn't finish.  We ordered the sweet tea and mango ice tea and they were the best we've ever had. I now get why this place is packed all the time."}
{"text":"Made our reservations for 8pm and  sat down right on time. Started the meal with beers that were flat, i then ordered another beer but they ran out of it. Followed by limited appetizers because they were out so many things. As we ordered we were told they were out of several fish selections. 20 mins later we were told they ran out of dirty rice and had to wait 45 mins to make some more. After waiting a very long time i had little appetite.. Once our food  arrived i was unimpressed by the anount of salt it had. Every dish my party ordered was drenched in salt. None of us finished our meal or wanted to take it to go. To compensate for the wait we were offered dessert which were limited because they ran out of so many... No surprise! 
I however, will compliment the waitresses. She was friendly and made our experience better."}
{"text":"It's been at least 4 years since we have had Pappadeaux in Texas.  Always enjoy it and love the crawfish trio.   This time around tried a variety of items and favorites were the crawfish, pappadeaux platter and the mussels.  Mussels were big and juicy in an awesome broth.    Layout is just like other Pappadeuax's around Texas, but felt a little larger in the patio waiting area.  Great service and got our fix for the next few years."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant very much, and actually  I have been there over ten times since 2013. Especially they have many types of beer, and many Cajun foods so I enjoy drinking beers and eating Cajun foods every time. Today my wife and I ate gumbo and spring roll, thus she said they tasted great, and I also felt good for them. In addition the server Ms. A was very kind and gentle for us, so we were very comfortable with our lunch time there. 
I really want to visit there to enjoy lunch and dinner again."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I have been here. After a shopping excursion with my Wife, we stopped in around 8pm. It wasnt too busy, and found a booth in the bar right off the bat.

We decided to be a little adventurous and try out the Fired Alligator and Fried Frog legs. Both were extremely good. Since I am afraid to death of alligators it was a little self satisifing eating one! Now instead of looking at them as scary things, I see them in bite sized fried nuggets! 
The Frog legs were equally as good. As the saying goes, tastes like chicken.

Dinner I had the Australian lobster tail. It was cooked perfectly! My wife had the tilapia laffayette thing, and it too was cooked perfectly. Nothing was overcooked or undercooked. They definately know what they are doing here cooking fish.

Waiter was prompt, courteous, and was johnny on the spot for water/tea refills. We didnt feel rushed at all, but we were definately in and out very quickly.

Would definatley visit again!"}
{"text":"We went here last night for my fiances birthday and I was very pleasantly surprised! The environment and ambience reminded me of a restaurant from New England. Casual but classy. Our server, Marcus, was absolutely delightful. He explained the menu to us and made some great suggestions. I ordered the Costa Rican mahi and it was perfect. It came with green beans and cheesy grits. I felt the seasoning was just right. We got the creme brûlée for dessert and I highly recommend others to try it!"}
{"text":"OMG! First time was the charm. Delicious and the waitress was great too. First time having oysters! Wow! Incredible! Fried calamari was great. Pasta with scallops and shrimp was to die for. The alfredo sauce was so good. I don't generally eat seafood but had a business dinner and I am so glad I did! Very pricey but hey I wasn't paying. Really had a nice evening."}
{"text":"My friends  love this place . I am always  tempted  to eat there . The wait is horrible  normally  45 minutes . I tried it recently.  I love their jumbo but it is a little  on the salty side . The restaurant  is dimly lit . Menu is huge which makes it hard to decide.  Service was a little  slow"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Phoenix ...food never fails and the Swamp Thing cocktail is amazing!"}
{"text":"5 Stars is saying a lot about the quality of your dining experience at Pappadeaux.

-I've been here probably over five times since I've lived in AZ and every experience is top notch! 
Our server was really chill, laid back and even though very busy always checked to see if we needed anything. Most people these days even if the place is dead will not even check on you unless they are looking to drop off the bill. 

-The food is bomb, I had Stuffed Jumbo Shrimp wrapped in bacon over dirty rice (recommended). 
Atmosphere is fun and poppin all on a Sunday at that! I was really surprised. 

-Beast Seafood in AZ hands down for the reasons above, I would definitely check it out if your in town and want some good food and southern hospitality in the desert. 

5 STARS"}
{"text":"The first time came it was great food. I got stuffed lobster . It came with these noodles with a great sauce. Went back a month later ordered the same thing did not get the noodles with sauce I asked about it. I was told it was no longer available. I was very disappointed. I don't know why it was no longer available. Have not been back since."}
{"text":"My husband swears by this place as he loves Cajun food.Unfortunately our 12 year old daughter had the crab cakes served straight up in a crab shel.That night she was violently ill! Pain continued along with unsettled stomach resulting in doctor visit as well as labs ordered( imagine what type of lab orders..not blood orders)! Very upsetting and not only did we pay over $100.00 for lunch, we paid for much more.Hoping nobody else experiences food poisoning. ...Needless to say if the husband wants Cajun we will have to go to New Orleans! I've never used Yelp, but felt this was important!"}
{"text":"Southern atmosphere 
Cajun theme
Seafood is great 
Other dishes are NOT n afterthought

Get the gator!! #perfection"}
{"text":"I know what your thinking. A chain? It can't be THAT good right? You can't go wrong with Pappadeaux. Unfortunately it's the only location in Arizona so most of the time it's pretty crowded during peak hours. I usually sit at the bar instead of waiting for a table. 

Starting with the drink options. They have a variety of mixed drinks for whatever you are in the mood for. My personal favorite is the swamp thing. 

If you are an oyster lover you came to the right place! They have the best oysters in town so make sure you at least get a dozen for an appetizer. If oysters are not you cup of tea then you must try the fried alligator. Trust me...you can't go wrong with this one.

Now on to the entrees! They have everything from seafood plates, steak, fresh fish, salads, and cajun favorites. Don't skip out on dessert they have quite a selection to satisfy your sweet tooth. 

The service is always great here! Everyone is professional, knowledgable, and friendly. I can honestly say this is one of the few places I trust for amazing seafood and cajun style dishes in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place had to be the highlight of my trip to Arizona. I haven't had such good seafood in a long time. Not to mention the great service by a young lady named yelena who well deserved the tip that she received, she made the experience even better. It was seven of us and she made sure drinks were full and food was out in a timely manner .Three of us had the shrimp etoufee and all i can say is Mercy. The crab mac and cheese yummy goodness . Also the fried calamari and seafood platter . I can keep going on and on because we ordered so much food we were stuffed before our entrees even came out. Everything was so good no complaints at all. On my way to catch my flight to San francisco lets just say this spot is now one of my favorite spots to visit in Arizona.....See you next time"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Best seafood around. My last visit, I went for lunch. I tried the shrimp and sausage jambalaya. Yum!

Service is always great! Relaxing atmosphere with indoor/outdoor seating. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Years back we were regular customers considering our snowbird status. In recent years we hadn't been here so when friends suggested we meet there to celebrate two wedding anniversaries it seemed a good idea. I am not so sure now. Friends split the halibut special and were enthusiastic. I ordered a wedge salad and the mussel appetizer and was happy enough.  My wife had the clam chowder and shrimp cocktail and was disappointed with quality of shrimp and said the chowder was terrible. She loved her cheesecake dessert and our friends enjoyed the creme brûlée and pecan pie.  Interestingly enough the salad our friends had came in a separate course whereas the salad I ordered and my wife's chowder came with our other dish which overfilled the table. Wine list was ok.  Waitress was seldom around. Water and ice tea ran dry. It was busy. I still feel this chain normally does a better job. We did get free desserts."}
{"text":"Fun place. But a recently changed menu took off the best salad.  Now gone is the lobster/shrimp/crab salad. We always make it a point to stop at the other sites at DFW and IAH.  Not my more."}
{"text":"This place is the place to be if you like seafood,great atmosphere and great food prices are really good the only bad experience I had there was the wait the hostesses told me 30 mins for a party of 2 and we waited a lil over an hour but still gave them 5 stars cause there food was great"}
{"text":"Father-in law was in town and felt like some seafood. I thought nowhere better to take this out of town-er than Pappadeaux's.. My husband and I have eaten a few times here for lunch and everytime it's been out of control good. We arrived friday night, no waiting needed. 

We sat in the back and ordered drinks, and a medium size gator app, yes as in alligator. My margarita was very sweet, felt like they added a cup of sugar in it, and it came in a fu/fu glass. The gator was good, but too small for three people. 
Wait staff was very nice and explained that the fish flys in fresh daily, and went into detail of the dishes we were going to order. I ordered the Marti Gra.. My husband and his dad got some seafood array?? not sure of the name.. but it looked good. My main dish came and woohoo... it was slammin good. It had crawfish, sausage, shrimp over a bed of creamy pasta.. it was so good, I could only eat 1/4 of the bowl. The portion sizes are pretty big. By the way there bread is baked daily and is so good, they serve a loaf of it for an app, if you eat the whole thing you can ask for another. (Very Good stuff) 

Anyways.. always fantastic food, if you have visitors from out of town that like seafood I would recommend this place... Lunch is cheaper, around $12-16 a plate.. Dinner from $15-35."}
{"text":"Best seafood in Phoenix.  The atmosphere is like dining in a little home restaurant.  The service is above average.  The food is to die for!  Rich and spicy cajun style cooking with delicious sauces.  When you order shrimp or oyster appetizers, you get big bivalves or shrimp.  Everything tastes fresh.  This is a favorite to take the wife for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Amazing service. Dominique, our waiter, was attentive, friendly and energetic. We were so happy with him. Drinks were refilled before we had a chance to ask. The fried alligator was so tasty! Ambiance of the restaurant was great as well. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Our 2 servers, Viv and Josh were outstanding, providing AMAZING EXCELLENT service and very professional, esp. Josh who served the children table. Thank you both. It was the first time for our family dining at Pappadeaux, since we re from SoCal. The portions were HUMONGOUSLY YUUUGE!! The wifey had the Blackened Catfish w Shrimp. Our son had the Fried Shrimp plate (long story short: Josh had a mixup and thought he had orderd from the kids menu, so his platter was a bit smaller compared to his teammates dining at the same table. Josh was so cool, he brought out more than a handful more fried shrimp!! ). Our daughter had the hot dog bites w fries, came w fruit & lemonade from the kids menu, and I had the very delicious Mixed Grilled Seafood Skewer platter (came with Salmon, Scallops & Shrimp w Dirty Rice, and Grilled Veggies). Wifey and I also shared a bowl of their equally delicious Seafood Gumbo. Would definitely come back again!

{"text":"Have had gone a few times for seafood great place! But  just recently had a surprise for my girlfriend who has a daughter in the Army. Her daughter and I made arrangements with the restaurant and were very gracious to help us out with the surprise. Since her mom had no idea she was here in state. What the restaurant did next was even a bigger surprise, all 7 military personnel and three of us as family members received a 50 percent discount off our bill. My hats off to them, any other place that I know of so far give 10 to 15 percent. What a great way to say thanks for service and support to our troops."}
{"text":"I came here with co-workers on a business trip to have some great food and unwind.  The decor is nice, and we were seated very quickly.  Service is fantastic and I never had a water glass less than half full.  Excellent specialty cocktails and ice-cold beer complimented our food.

I ordered a appetizer sampler and it was incredible.  Highly recommended.  Also had fish which was cooked to perfection.  Pappadeaux is a bit on the pricey side, but that was expected and the food and service are definitely up to par with the prices."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been celebrating Mardi Gras at Pappadeaux for several years. We have had the best waiters that are extremely fun and cheerful. The manager even stopped by our table to make sure my chocolate food allergy was taken seriously and made every accommodations for me. We definitely had a terrific experience. 
Complements to the chef - alligator was nice and tender, as well as my crawfish. Thanks for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"I do not go here often, but would highly recommend it for those special occasions.  The atmosphere was stunning, with romantic lighting as well as a live entertainer.  I had the sea bass and every bite was delicious with lots of flavor and flaked off on my fork.  Can not wait to go again."}
{"text":"A unique place in Phoenix where you can get fresh fish, craw fish, gator tail and soft shell crab!  Great service,  very nice ambiance, but it does get crouded and loud on the weekends.  Don't forget your wallet, because it ain't cheep to bring the swamp to the desert."}
{"text":"We had a great time food is good a little pricey but atmosphere service worth it we had a private room by luck it's real loud there but exciting definitely worth it. 5 stars is taking everything into account, server Vivanita  (I think) was great she handled table of 9 separate checks never rushed us. I had shrimp etouffe was good and spicey decent portion  gumbo was awesome  (small portion) we were in the wine room which was wonderful because it was private except for servers getting wine every once and a while. Well worth it, the restaurant itself large vibrant bar activity and people watching on a Friday night was great. Diverse crowd was beautiful. Keely the manager also was very nice."}
{"text":"The service and food was amazing. Even though they were extremely busy, our server was on her game! She was polite, funny and never let our drinks get empty. Sure wish I could recall her name! 

The food was amazing! My steak was cooked to perfection and the rock lobster was delicious! We were a party of 5 and everyone enjoyed their food!

Will definitely be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Started with the wonderful Blue piont oysters. I had the Seafood platter, and it was the first time I ever had anything served with fries where I couldn't care less about the fries. Everything was lightly battered and not at all greasy. Husband had the Pasta Mardi Gras, and it too was amazing. We topped off the night with house made banana pudding and pralines cheese cake (both free for our birthdays).
Stuffed and happy to have leftovers. 
Oh, and they also give a Veteran discount with ID."}

{"text":"Great service, beautiful atmosphere and very, very tasty,....we loved it all! We all tried several dishes and ate off each others plates,...hahaha! My one and only suggestion is add tomatoes to the po-boy. The French bread was ok, but when you've had New Orleans french bread, it's hard to not compare! I will definitely visit Pappadeaux's every single time we're in town! Thanks for the good eats,.....my taste buds were doing the HaPPy dance!"}
{"text":"For my 100th review, i choose Pappadeaux. The first time i was ever there , Saturday night.   Fantastic ,Wow we loved it!  
Our server was Robert, he gets an A plus in customer service..We started with Water ,wine, Ice Tea, and my girl got coffee. He brought lemons and straws for our water, Brewed fresh coffee and kept my Ice Tea refilled the entire night.
The meals were incredible. Our appetizer  was to die for.   
The meals are huge ,we had to take it to go and we had enough for dinner on Sunday. Mediterranean Calamari was so good!  We did not like the Capers in it, but it also comes with fired artichoke!! 
Lobster Bisque, was probably the best i have ever had!  The Lobster,Crab, and Talapia were all very fresh. They say they have it flown in every day. I believe it because, it was as i said fantastic!    The decor is very good, dark wood, everything nice and big.  
 We cannot wait to come back here. Lots of Parking in the lot."}
{"text":"I have found a new favorite restaurant.  If there is one place on my reviews where I could go for a special occasion - this would be it.

To start - the ambience...  You feel immersed in New Orleans, from the moderately lit dining hall, gaslit lamps, waiters in black pants and white aprons and wonderful music.

The food was absolutely fantistic.  I had the Crawfish Trio, which was a mix of Crawfish Etoufee, Fried Crawfish and Sauteed Crawfish.  The etoufee had a rich, dark, buttery roux and was smothered over dirty rice.  

The sauteed crawdad was a pleasant surprise.  I expected a crawdad sauteed in butter, but instead it was sauteed in a spicy cream sauce.  They also served the dinner with a loaf of fresh bread baked in-house.  

If you've been to Disneyland's \"Blue Bayou\", this place reminds you a little of that restaurant.

The shelfish/seafood selection is EXTENSIVE.

Like it and Loved It!  Go to this place and you will not be disappointed.  I heard they have several locations throughout the US.   When are they coming to California?!"}
{"text":"Always great but prices are getting out of reach. Service for this location seems \"Iffy\". Sometimes good other times not good. We have frequented at least 10 different Pappas restaurants in Texas and AZ. location. Big fan but the prices are rising and there's no real reason other than padding for more profit margins. Understand all that but it's making it a \"No-Go\" for a budget minded family."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the atmosphere with a southern bayou vibe. The menu had quite a selection. Some menu items were intriguing. I ordered the Halibut,shrimp & octopus entree. The halibut was a bit over cooked but tasty, shrimp was yummy too. The octopus was very chewy & I wasn't fond of the taste. My daughter had the filet mignon Oscar & love it. It was just the 2 of us & we did have an appetizer & each had 1 cocktail. The check was $142 which is on the steep side."}
{"text":"One of the best seafood places I ever been to.  I was in doubt at first since I am in Arizona, but found out this family owned operation gets daily deliveries from Houston.  Frog legs fell of the bone.  They offered Caribbean lobster and clam chowder was so tasty.  Also had the Bluepoint down oysters.  So many options on the menu it was hard to decide.  Try it out if you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh Pappadeaux's, how I wish you were closer to my home. If I didn't have to drive 40-45 minutes to get there, I would probably spend my entire paycheck on two things: Oysters and Fried Alligator. As such, I'm going to stick to those two things in my review. Those are really the only two things that I eat when I go, because I cannot get enough of them.

First things first, the staff and ambiance. The music can get a little bit loud, but the atmosphere is always fun and upbeat. The staff all seems to be pretty friendly, too. Our server was especially friendly and helpful. This is definitely a place I like to go to with my friends to hang out and have a good night.

Now, I'll talk about the food. First, the oysters. The oysters here are great! They give you a few different sauces to go along with them, each of which has a distinct, delicious flavor to add. To make the oysters even better, they have incredible deals on them! They only cost about $4.00 per dozen for the special they supposedly have running almost all the time. The type of oysters that you get on the special vary based on whatever factors affect the catching of oysters. As for the Fried Alligator, IT'S FRIED ALLIGATOR. As soon as I saw it on the menu, I had to have it. To quote one of my favorite movies (Transformers), \"Alligator is the most succulent meat.\" The Fried Alligator here is one of my favorite things to eat. I absolutely cannot have enough Fried Alligator. The meat is moist and juicy with a light and non-fishy flavor, and the batter/breading layer is fried crisp. That combo of the moist meat with the crispy outside is phenomenal. Add on the dusting of cajun seasoning and the creole dipping sauce, and you have a dish you won't forget. 

In conclusion, I definitely recommend this place. I can't really speak for anything other than the oysters and the fried alligator, but do I need to? Come on, it's Fried Alligator and cheap oysters! Stop reading and go to Pappadeaux's!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! !! I absolutely love this place.  I just graduated from Grand Canyon University with my Master's degree and wanted to celebrate.  My family and I went here for the first time.  My dad fell in love with the Lobster tail, Mom loved the steak, and I loved all the sea food. Great service,  justified price, and the dessert is fantastic! !."}
{"text":"The price is a bit high. The kids' meals are good quality compared to some places. We have gone here three times. The service is always good. I typically get some kind of fish along with raw oysters. The included bread is good. We enjoyed the blackened alligator appetizer."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Even though it was a busy night, they did a great job seating us in a reasonable amount of time.  Once we ordered the food came out quickly.  I highly recommend if you are looking for Cajun food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing.  If this place didn't break the bank I would be there all the time.  The crab cakes covered in rich sause with crawdad's is unbelievable.  Atmosphere draws you in and the service is top notch.

It is pricey but once you taste the food you will understand the price."}
{"text":"Delicious seafood! If you love seafood and can style, this is the place to go! Wonderful customer service too! My second time visiting Phoenix, and this is my second time coming here."}
{"text":"Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater. The shrimp on skewer was over cooked with no flavor and the Caribbean lobster tail had no favor what so ever. first time there and might just be the last."}
{"text":"Was here about a week ago and if you are in or going through Phoenix this is a must go to. Had several items and all were great. The Oysters were fanominal.  The Lobster was terrific and the steak was beautifully cooked. The most disappointed part was that I could not have dessert.  I was just so full."}
{"text":"AMAZING. WORTH the hour long wait. Best seafood I've had in AZ. I recommend the jumbo crab cakes and the swamp thing (drink). Pretty much anything else you eat there will be amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for mother's day! It was packed but the wait wasn't too bad and they had a band and drinks while you were waiting. 

We got Calamari for the app. It was your typical Calamari. My sister and I shared the Sampler Platter. It had Tilipia, Shrimp, and Chicken with fries. We got full pretty fast, and it was really good. I don't normally like seafood, but it was all fried and good. Dessert we shared the turtle brownie...It was a little dry and needed to be warmer. 

Our server was really outgoing and funny. It was super busy so it took her awhile to get to us, but she was a good waitress. Made us laugh quite a bit. 

I'd like to go back on a calmer day to see if the quality was lacking because of the Mother's Day rush."}
{"text":"I have been around Phoenix for about 4 years and today was one of the saddest days of these 4 years... I realised today that I was so close but so far away from an amazingly delicious kitchen of Pappadeaux Seafood for those 4 long years... wish somebody had told me about this place earlier and I would have spent at least a double dozen nights at Pappadeaux while I was in Phoenix... what an amazing place !

We started with a bowl of \"Louisiana\" Seafood Gumbo... yummmm... spicy and so tasty ! ... (those who don't go for spicy food should stay a yard away from it... it was really spicy... as in Indian Vindaloo spicy... ) ... I felt like I could have easily had a couple more of that gumbo... :)

Shrimp Creole With white rice and Crawfish Etouffee With dirty rice followed that gumbo... both of these were so mouth watering... a perfectly cooked Crawfish with rice so close to Jambalaya, it was probably the best seafood I have had after my last visit to New Orleans...

The place carried a very nice, relaxed ambiance with light jazz in the background... our server was very soft spoken and knew her way through the menu and preparations... I don't think this place gets crowded easily as it could sit, to my guess, 5 times more number of guests that an averagely large restaurant... 

Overall, definite 5 stars for variety, taste, ambiance and service... be it a family or a romantic one on one dinner, this place is just too awesome !"}
{"text":"Seated quickly, there is not much of a wait at 6 p.m., even though the place was PACKED!!!  We ordered, and watched as plate after mounded plate was  delivered to delighted patrons.  I mean, it ALL looked good.  Hubby had the salmon Oscar, I had ordered the Sea Bass.  The salmon Oscar was roasted slowly , so it was a glistening, flakey slab, slathered in crab, shrimp, and scallops with a sauce I SWEAR I could have licked off the plate.  My piece of sea bass was larger than a tennis ball, slathered with a gooey cheese, and seasoned top to bottom, resting on a perfectly sauteed mess of spinach.  Really.  I cannot stop thinking about how danged good it was.  Wine list was fine, Key lime pie needed to be a little more tart, but that is a personal preference.  All in all, I would eat there three times a week if the budget allowed.  It's that good."}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy on a typical Thursday night, but the experience that I got was incredible. I cannot even remember the last time I was here - probably it was 5 or 6 years ago - since I live in the East Valley. I was running errand and decided to visit the restaurant again.

A long long time ago, I was amazed by the flavorful and scrumptious crawfish varieties. However, since crawfish is not on season anymore, I ought to try other items on the menu. I was hesitate at first, but pictures and appealing descriptions of the food got me. So I decided to try Mixed Gulf Coast Oysters & Shrimp for appetizers, along with Seafood Cobb Salad, 
Chilean Sea Bass, Crab Fingers Combo, Atlantic Swordfish, Scallop & Shrimp. 

The seafood were so fresh, and the Crab Finger Combo was creamy and tasty. Especially, the Seabass was fantastic. To me it tasted as close as the taste of lobster - Well... I may be a bit of exaggerating, but it was moist, chewy, and cooked perfectly at the same time. 

Our server was quick and attentive, needless to say the fries came out within a heart beat. I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Yayyyy for happy hour and a beautiful setting and scenery!! We love coming here for Happy Hour. We stopped coming here to just have dinner. Their entree's aren't that great in our opinion and especially for the high price. But their Happy Hour and almost all their appetizers and drinks are worthy of 4-5 stars!! My -1 star is for their regular entree's. We love love love their sautéed crab finger (you won't have this amazingness anywhere else, but they only have them when crab is in season,) Alligator (usually melt in your mouth,) and perfect oyster's! They also have Grey Goose Martinis for 8 dollars (happy hour.) The oyster's have this delicious ceviche sauce, it's a must try!! The building is mostly red brick, surrounded with water fountains and greenery!! It's very gorgeous. If I could imagine a restaurant in Louisiana, I would imagine it to look and feel like this. We will be back for Happy Hour as we have been doing for about 2 years now. But most likely that's it. Wish we enjoyed the entree's but the Happy Hour is plenty worth it!!"}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad about the food or the service in the past.  Always my favorite place.  However, I went this past Saturday evening and contracted some sort of allergy from the shell fish that I've had many times before.  As soon as I was leaving the restaruant I got sick in the bathroom.  As we were leaving the parking lot, my entire head and neck broke out in hives-and I don't have a seafood allergy.
My date is now also sick and we shared the food.  He is having severe stomach issues.  After reading Patricia M.s review dated 11/6/13, I decided to comment in the hopes that management may look into their food quality and kitchen cleanliness."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the WORLD. I love seafood and flavor. If you want both, Pappadeaux's is a master at the highest level. I always try something new and I am never disappointed. The atmosphere is always energetic. The food on a different tier than its competitors. I have tried the lobster, seafood pasta, seafood fondue and others. It is all fantastic. My only regret is that there is not one in southern Oregon. Each time I am in Phoenix I swing by. Thank you for your memorable food and great service."}
{"text":"We had to try here being that I love seafood & my hubby is the oyster man!! So glad we did, it definitely did not disappoint!! We left there full as a tick & we could barely even finish our entrees since their portions were quite generous. We started with the oyster & chilled shrimp app as you'd guess, my hubby chose to start with the blue points & OMG is all I can say!! He was completely in love with the oysters & the shrimp were a definite hit also, very good value for the buck!! I then had to try a cup of the crawfish bisque, all I can say is there's really nothing to say except it was creaminess heaven!! Then yes the hubby needed just a few more oysters so he wanted to compare the gulf coast & he could of course tell the difference with their saltiness compared to the blue points sweetness but he said either way they were both sheer bliss!! Then we've got the entrees but at this point who really has room, lol!! My hubby chose the half of grilled chicken because he needs more white meat in his life, haha & he was so glad he did! He had the chicken with the brocolini & red skin mashed potatoes, he said everything was so moist & fresh! I had the grilled seafood skewers with the chilled barley salad with fresh arugula, okay everything was soooooo good & the portions were huge!! I literally could only eat half of one of the skewers & the barley salad was so good you almost forgot that it was healthy!! Can't wait to bring my southern mother in law their when she comes out to visit us because she'll absolutely love it. This will definitely a hit & will be one of our regular spots, you definitely get a great value for your money!!"}
{"text":"This place is great but the food is extremely expensive. My group went here for a dinner party and it cost us around $2000 worth of food. Anyway, the portions are alright and I loved the crispy alligator plus several types of lobster tails. The only one dish I didn't like was a dish that contains rice, two pieces of sausages, and a baked potato (I think). The sausages were too soft and soggy. They ran out of cheesecakes when I wanted to order. But the creme brulee was good. The prime rib was huge (I mean for that price it better be). The margaritas were great and there were four types of margaritas. I didn't like the Swampthing too much. We ordered like 10 batches of oysters. My favorite was a sea bass dish. The fish was soft and melt in your mouth. It's covered in a creamy and buttery white sauce. The service is great!"}
{"text":"First time at Pappadeaux. Arrived 10 mins early with reservations and waited 20 anyway. Hmm.
Our server, Reno, arrive about 7 mins after that. He dropped off water and turned to leave but we had waited long enough to know we wanted the Oyster Duo for an app. He tried to leave again before we could order drinks. Not a good start. 

Besides the app and two drinks, we got Filet Minion with Lobster Tail and the Atlantic Salmon Alexander. The bill came to $119.20 plus tip. 

The oysters were good. Our favorites were the cheesy ones but the spinach-hollandaise oysters were good too - just too much spinach. Most of the food on the entrées was excellent. The fillet was seasoned perfectly, tender and juicy-just what my wife wanted. The lobster tail was huge, accompanied by a vat of butter and some big, tender asparagus. My salmon was cooked just right, with a crispy crust but was still moist and with great Cajun seasoning. The crawfish, scallops and shrimp were all good but the shrimp were small. The decadent sauce over all was rich and creamy. I didn't care for the dirty rice but I think it was due to flavors, not the way it was cooked. Just not my kind of rice dish. 

Reno was okay as a server. He was new and didn't have a routine down yet but he was warm and engaging and he will be good if his managers will give him a chance to bloom. 

We may go back to Pappadeaux again. The parking lot was cutthroat and the wait time for some was brutal. Perhaps we'll return in the summer when the snowbirds have left!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Friday night with his parents for his birthday celebration.  I had heard it gets backed and that I should make a reservation.  Trying to ensure no annoyances with waiting, I made sure to call early in the afternoon to ask for a 6:00 pm reservation.  They don't take reservations during that time ... okay, that's fine, I understand BUT they will accept call-aheads and they will make sure your name is already on the waiting list before you get there.  Woo! that works! I call at 5:30 pm and let them know we will be half an hour.  Due to the fact they did not have a wait at that time, they would not take my name or party information.  When we got there at 6 pm, they had a wait.  I was decently annoyed but since it was only a 15-20 minute wait for our table, I wasn't overly annoyed.  We got our table, our server, and placed our order.  Sadly, there were multiple tables around us in and out before we even got our entrees.  There were several tables that ended up having three parties in and out before we were finally done.  That was a pretty big annoyance to say the least, especially since we were pretty hungry and we saw other tables getting served at a much more rapid pace!!!  The place does extremely well because the food is absolutely AMAZING.  The seafood gets flown in daily and not too many seafood places in Arizona can say the same thing.  Despite the waits we had to have to get seated and to finally get our food and then the wait for dessert, I still managed to embarass myself with the amount of amazing tasting food I devoured"}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced.  If you want good Cajun food, head on out to Flavors of Louisiana in Avondale.  Better prices, great food. Heck, you're better off at Popeyes on Greenway and 35th Ave."}
{"text":"I learned to eat in New Orleans, so I'm not easily impressed by Cajun places. This is authentic. I love good crawfish étouffée and this is really good. I can recommend this cuisine to anyone. It isn't fast food cheap, but it isn't fast food. It is good value because it is such good quality."}
{"text":"Probably the only place to get fresh seafood in the desert. Cajun cuisine at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Great place to some pretty good seafood.  Love the service.  Got to try the Fried Alligator appetizer.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years - and it has always been one of our very favorite places. Perfect for a special night out - either for a romantic dinner or with friends.  But tonight we discovered a new thing to love here at Pappadeaux: the chargrilled salmon diablo! Perfectly prepared - and the flavors of the mesquite-grilled salmon were perfectly complemented by the slightly tangy diablo cream sauce, with big tasty pieces of crab and crawfish in it. Even the broccoli was delicious! Steamed with a light sprinkling of garlic lemon olive oil and a touch of warm red pepper flakes. Love!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. From the beginning to the end was amazing. The food was amazing!   Worth every penny, and our waitress Brooke she was on point!!!  Thank you girl! Keep doing ur thing!  And Pappadeaux you mos def need to keep doing what you're doing!! 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER STOP COMING HERE!!! Everything I have ever ordered has been phenomenal. Great service & atmosphere!!! Worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service.  I have been coming here for at least 15 years, im going to say that there are times where you can tell they changed their chef or management because the food will be off and service will be a mess but after just eating here again a few days ago their food and service is on point right now so i am loving it, their alligator is the best with the old red sauce."}
{"text":"We used to love Pappadeaux when I lived in San Antonio and in Phoenix but this trip we had a less than steller experience. I want to love this restaurant with the cool vibe and atmosphere. It started out with Bread that was a little over done on the outside, and then their version of Lobster Bisque which was a little too cajun for my liking, but it is a cajun restaurant after all so they won't loose any points there. The Wife had a good Pasta dish with Crab and scallops which was a little peppery but still good. 

I ordered a stuffed 2 lb lobster which was a cluster from the beginning. About 5 minutes after i ordered it, the server came out and said they were out of 2lb lobsters but they could give me 2 one pounders for the same price, so i went with it. Another 5 minutes passes and out comes a manager and trainee with a menu telling me they are completely out of lobsters and I would need to select something else. Then another 5 minutes pass and the server comes back out, takes my menu and says the manager didn't know what she was talking about and he has them working on my 2 1 lb. lobsters. Now another 10 minutes pass and out comes my meal, and i get 2 1 lb. lobsters, however they forget to stuff them. So now we get another visit from a different manager apologizing yet again for the mixup. I finally get my lobster and it is overcooked and tough. Guess it wasn't my night for lobster, or theirs for that matter.

They did give us dessert on the house which was a nice gesture.

I think next time i'll pass on Pappadeaux."}
{"text":"The food is decent. A knock off of New Orleans Cajun food. We have been to New Orleans many times and there is no doubt when your eating at Pappadeaux's you are not eating in New Orleans. It is fairly high priced for what you get. At the best it is ok"}
{"text":"Such a huge restaurant. Very awesome looking actually. It's more like down in the south atmosphere. The food is all very delicious of all the times I've been there Taste of different selections. Great spices to them. Very fast friendly staff. Very clean nice and neat. Didn't have to wait long or that long for the food."}
{"text":"Loved!  Oysters were wonderful. Red fish and lump crab with jumbo shrimp and squash risotto and the pasta with vodka cream sauce were delicious and very well done. I was a little disappointed on the bread pudding; it was okay, but I'd come back any time. 
The service was prestigious.  Barely any wait time for NYE at 9:30pm. It was great."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed. We use to love Pappadeaux, but it wasn't good this time. We moved to Sedona and brought friends down to enjoy a great seafood restaurant, but it wasn't the same. All of our dishes came out cold. Clam chowder, they did take off because it was sent back. No one had eaten their fries, and our friend had left most of his shrimp. The oysters were great!!!  Our poor server was overwhelmed and was lacking on refills and forgot most of what we had asked for. We would love to bring more friends back, but probably will not make the drive, since it's not the same. Too bad."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best place for fresh lobster/seafood. I was able to pick out the lobster I wanted from the tank and it was served fresh with butter and asparagus. The service was incredible and made for a great date. I will be going again soon I hope."}
{"text":"Hoo, boy..these are some good eats!

We stopped in for lunch to find a bustling crowd in a massive restaurant, though the attentive staff more than made up for the lunch rush.

We were seated quickly and had little trouble finding something on the seafood heavy, Cajun-inspired menu. Kicking off the meal was an order of the alligator bites: spiced, fried chunks of alligator with a zesty red sauce for dipping and a heap of crispy potato straws. The gator was cooked perfectly, neither mushy nor rubbery with a noticeable punch. Figuring it would be awhile before I saw alligator on a menu again, I went for the half po boy/gumbo lunch combo. The baguette was stuffed with fried alligator, lettuce, and pickles covered with tartar and cocktail sauces. Topped with a squeeze of lemon, it was hearty, delicious, and paired nicely with a cup of fiery andouille and seafood gumbo, packed with crab meat, sausage, shrimp, and that holy trinity of bell pepper, celery, and onions.

Worth the trek from lower Phoenix (or the suburbs)."}
{"text":"AWESOME! One of my favorite restaurants for my \"King Crab Leg Fix\" ! Great food,fun atmosphere, wonderful service and will always remind me of our first dinner with \"meeting  my  family \" ! Greg my love, your taste in choosing the perfect restaurant and girlfriend (me) was and still is awesome!"}
{"text":"The shrimp and mahi with dirty rice is fantastic. The French bread before the dinner is fresh and tasty. The restaurant is a bit too loud though."}
{"text":"I almost didn't want to write this review because of how busy it already gets there!   But they deserve some serious kudos for the quality of their food and service.     We went as a group and ordered the Blue Point oysters, Mediterranean Calamari, Boudin and Shrimp Cocktail as appetizers.    

Oysters  - fantastic, fresh - great presentation - on special for $10 a dozen.   Heaven. 
Mediterranean Calamari - Wow they took calamari to a whole new level.   I won't ruin the surprise - just try it.   
Boudin - I'm a bit of a freak when it comes to Boudin (aka Blood Sausage).   I like mine with more blood and less filler.   Theirs is more filler with less blood.   It's also quite spicy.   I had to try it, but probably wouldn't order it again.
Shrimp Cocktail - Really nice sized fresh tasting shrimp.   Really nice presentation on a bed of crushed ice.   Great appy.

Dinners-
I had their Salmon Alexander.    What is Alexander?   Grilled Shrimp.   Grilled Scallops.  Crawfish.   In a LEMON BUTTER WINE OMG SO GOOD SAUCE.  All of this on top of perfectly grilled salmon.  Came with dirty rice, which, on the scale of dog barf to awesome - you guessed it - awesome.  (full disclosure - never ate dog barf before - probably won't eat dog bark ever).

Dessert - Didn't indulge.

Service - You would think you were in a place where they somehow bred servers or grew them on trees.  There are so many of them buzzing around taking care of your every need in a prompt manner.    (I think I finally figured out why there are so many cars in the parking lot - they have a ton of servers!)

Give it a try - I promise - you won't be disappointed.  Just don't go anytime I'm going there so I can get a table, OK???"}
{"text":"We get to Pappadeaux's on a Monday night.  It was packed.  We put our name in and we were told it would be a half hour wait.  Not bad.  We were early and we were waiting for another friend to show up.  She finally arrived and we chatted during our wait.  Our half hour wait turned into an hour.  How did that happen????  My friend complained and we were seated just like that.  We made it to our table, relief.  Our waitress was friendly.  The bread was good.  There was a great special on gulf oysters and our waitress explained that the season was coming to an end.  $4 something for a dozen oysters.  Great deal.  They were tasty too.  We had them for an appetizer.  I was happy so far.

I ordered the scallops.  They were not huge.  In fact my entree was not that big portion wise.  I had to order a salad a la carte.  No bang for your buck here.  The scallops were over $20 bucks and adding a salad to that pushed my portion of the bill over $30.  I had an ice tea too.  I enjoyed my salad and the scallops were good.  BUT!  I felt a little ripped off.

One thing they have to change is the PA system.  \"Bob party of 3 your table is ready\" is heard loudly throughout the entire restaurant.  Yikes!!!  Change that please.

Pappadeaux's is A-OK."}
{"text":"My first experience with Pappadeaux was ~6 years ago, just after moving to Phoenix (I worked nearby and drove past it every day). Try as I might, the only remarkable thing I can recall about that meal was the alligator and was unimpressed with how chewy 'gator is.

Fast forward to the present: five stars for ambience and freshness of seafood, three for value, one for finding a myriad of extraneous items in my entree. I had ordered the Blackened Catfish Opelousas (with oysters, shrimp & crabmeat in a lemon garlic butter sauce with dirty rice). I found a mini pearl (which I promptly lost when it rolled off my napkin) and sliver of something hard like shell in the butter sauce, and a small oddly shaped nugget of God-knows-what in the dirty rice. I'm still confused by that last unknown item. No, it wasn't an uncooked grain of rice; it was shaped somewhat like a dreidel and about the size of a mustard seed. It was in one of the last bites of food on my plate and left a poor impression in my mind as I left.

The girlfriend and I ordered bloody marys and a dozen oysters on the half shell LONG before our waiter returned for taking our entree request. Drinks came first, then an apology about why it was taking so long to get the oysters shucked. On the second return to apologize for the delay, we put in the rest of our order. A third return to apologize included a loaf of their french bread. The bread was phenomenal, and went well with our bloody mary drinks - but between their house bloody mary and the Absolut Cajun Bloody Mary, go with the house version. It's $2 cheaper and virtually no difference in spiciness - which was a disappointment to me because I really like bloody marys to be quite spicy. The oysters arrived a few minutes before our entree, and at $9.95 per dozen they're a rockin' bargain despite their delivery being late.

I don't understand how people think this is a cheap place to eat. All one has to do is go to their website to see prices up front. Entrees are generally priced $19.95 - $24.95, although steak items are significantly higher. Adding a drink - not your obligatory diet Coke, but a REAL drink - and tax, AND tip, pushes the price easily into a 3-dollar sign tier. Unless, of course, people opt for the cheapest items on the menu, ask only for water, and tip a mere 10%.

I'll return, but only for happy hour and cheap oysters."}
{"text":"Hello All! Last night my husband Michael and I went out to dinner to celebrate my new job, we went to Pappadeaux which we had been numerous time before but last night I have to say we had the BEST server that Pappadeaux has her name is Kara Reveas and she listen to want we liked she picked up on the fact that my husband doesn't eat meat so when she brought our meals out she replaced his dirty rice with white rice since they prepare their dirty rice with meat. She offered us choices to try on our return visit of certain items on the menu. You could see when she explained how they prepared the meal that she was passionate in her job and wanting the customer to have a wonderful food experience. We also meet the Manager from Mississippi Cori Woods she was absolutely wonderful as well very charming and caring you could tell that she really enjoys her work. If you haven't eaten there please stop in you will be so happy that you did. The food, atmosphere and service is 5 Stars and remember to ask for Kara she works Thursday evenings. 
Oh and the Alligator is great you need to try it!!!!!!"}

The key to a good experience here is \"Reservation!\" You don't have a Reservation you could be waiting for an hour to hour and half for a table. We ordered gulf oyster on the half shell it comes with horseradish/ketchup/cilantro base soy  dressing on the side and I love mixing the sauces it was very good. I had the Alaskan King Crab legs and they were so fresh and sweet and just right. My fiancé had the Branzino with grilled shrimp and Broccolini in a herb lemon butter sauce it was yum!

Well so happy the manager did us a nice  gesture !!! Well done"}
{"text":"Very nice variety -- My hubby is a huge fan and practically has our car on auto-pilot to drive in and grab a bite.  The restaurant is beautiful inside, definitely not a fast food place, but still comfortable and relaxing."}
{"text":"Great place to eat ...best Cajun food I've had! Love the variety and portion size! :) will be back again"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my wife today. It's the second time I've been and her first. After my first visit it rocketed into my top five favourite restaurants of all time. They have some top notch food, and the best thing is that it's such a deliciously welcome change from the bottom-feeder's Mexican crap that you see all over Phoenix. The menu is varied and I think I eventually will want to try everything. Appetizers include fried alligator and frog's legs. The main I had today was their Mardi Gras Pasta, which is linguini with tomato, thin-sliced garlic, andouille sausage, crawfish meat, onion and delicious shrimp topped with a really nice creamy sauce. Absolutely delicious. The wife had mahi-mahi with an even NICER sauce, and dirty rice on the side. Although a tiny bit on the pricy side it's definitely worth coming back to. Large open seating (outdoor seating also available), dimly lit, old-style jazz, a large full-service bar and a very quaint outside waiting area with water feature, giant fans etc. The service was also great and both times I've been, the waiters have been very helpful (the first guy told me that if I got the large serving of alligator, to try it 'half-blackened' - a great tip which allowed me to taste both 'styles' of the appetizer). They also have things I've not heard of before like etoufee and opelousas. If my dad didn't live over seven thousand miles away I'd take him here in an instant - he'd absolutely love the place. You will too.

Oh yeah, they have creme brulee (with fresh fruit) and sweet potato pecan pie, amongst other things, for dessert. We had the latter - yum."}
{"text":"Very beautiful restaurant. Very beautiful. Food isn't spectacular and the price surely will leave you budgeting in order to afford a meal here again. Very pricey... even for simpler meals of chicken and noodles. If money isn't an issue, then definitely go. It was more of an experience then anything else. But a good, memorable experience. :)"}
{"text":"I thought the food was only ok. I  have been t Papadeaux's in Houston,Dallas and Austin and the food was great!  

We were hungry for Cajun food and even though the restaurant was 30 miles away,my wife and I gave it a try .

The gumbo was as far from the real thing as I have ever tasted. It wasn't awful,it just wasn't gumbo. 
The Shrimp Po Boy was ok and they were generous with the amount of shrimp but
I wouldn't drive 30 miles to go there again."}
{"text":"We love this place. The stuffed shrimp are to die for!!! The lighting stinks but the food makes up for it...it is pricey so make sure you got enough in the bank..drinks are good as well.... Great party room too"}
{"text":"Expensive, but worth it Everytime! Dessert is yummy and meals are great. Kind of a dark setting, but delicious nevertheless. I would however recommend making an appointment cause the wait time could get long of you just walked in. Most things have some extra spice to them also, being a Cajun Resturant it was to be expected, but the gumbo was very spicy, almost too spicy even for me. Delish however. No complaints at all. Great service, ambiance and experience."}
{"text":"Best steak I have had in a while! The steak was comparable with Mastros! I could not believe how good it was for the price! Also the service was great! Definitely recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really impressed by this restaurant. I've been here a few times and the food and service are consistently excellent. They excelled at everything yesterday, ensuring folks had the best Mother's Day experiences possible. Colin is one of the best servers we have ever had at any restaurant. Loved how well they prepared for the crowds yesterday with full staffing, free bottled waters, free snacks, entertainment and ballon artists for the kids (and grown ups too)."}
{"text":"We arrived and found parking quickly. Very few people waiting in the outside seating area. Feb 15th on a Weds. Checked in at the host station she told us 15-30 mins. The lady behind us had a child and a male with them. They where told the same time.

Our kid and their child starting talking and watching the lobsters. 25 mins went by and they complained to the hostess and they where sat promptly. I wait another 5 and said something. The hostess was extremely rude and said \" I can see how long you have been waiting\" when clearly they seated several people that arrived after us. She never mention the bar table area was open seating.

At 42 mins of waiting I told them either seat us now or we are leaving. She said sorry I can't and people are taking longer to eat than expected. Another server heard us and said some one was getting up I. The bar table area.

She was kind and offered to help. She cleaned the table and got us menus then told us our server would be with us shortly.

Not one person greeted us, looked at us or anything for ten plus mins. We where not even looking at the menus because you this time we knew what we wanted 25 mins ago. Out 4 year old was starving

We started to leave and the this server guys said. I am going to get to you in a rude sarcastic voice.

I said no thanks and we left.

I did call as we drove to another restaurant and the manager was friendly and offered to buy us dinner if we came back. At that point we just did not feel welcome to eat their so we declined."}
{"text":"The best part of the dining experience was sitting on the beautiful patio. Service was average and took a while to get drink refilled. I wish there were better options for non-fish eaters. We had a friend there that had a difficult time as most were seafood dishes. I enjoyed the meal but wasn't impressed enough to go back. I had a salad and it was ordinary. Two people had the mahi and enjoyed it and the grits."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food!  Closest thing to new orleans seafood.  I always bring my family here and they really love it!  Prefect for big parties.  Note: must try the category 5 daiquiri (more than one is at your own risk) lol! Enjoy!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I love Pappadeaux, it's my husband's favorite place to eat. I finally tried the alligator! We had a large order where half was battered and the other half was blackened, it truly was amazing! What I didn't plan on was paying $25 for fish and shrimp and getting $20 worth of french fries piled up on my plate. When I think of Papadeaux restaurant I think of dirty rice not fries. Otherwise an amazing experience."}
{"text":"I have been here 2-3 times in the past and remember liking it a lot more.  Today, however, I went during the lunch and thought the food was very uninspired.

I really hate to say this, but I think Pappadeaux is becoming Red Lobster with a Cajun twist.  This place has somehow transformed itself from a unique eatery into a full blown Red Lobster meets Joe's Crab Shack franchise.  The only difference is the price (higher) and the seasoning (Cajun) instead of over-salting.  The seafood is no doubt frozen as well.

Sure, I love fried fish and other creole calorie bombs just as much as everyone else, but I think this place is losing its authenticity as it makes its play towards the masses.

Anyway, I wouldn't mind coming back to try more of their offering to prove my theory, but I'm certainly not going to rush."}
{"text":"I don't eat seafood nearly enough, primarily because it is typically so expensive, and the pricing here was no exception.

I showed up for dinner at 9:30 on a Tuesday night, so they were not very busy. The restaurant itself was rather large and very nicely decorated. They had a beautiful patio area and I asked if I could be seated out there, but was told it was not available at this time. (I don't know if this was due to it being 9:30 at night or what, but it was an amazing 75 degrees out and would have been perfect. Of course, for most acclimated Arizonans, that is rather chilly.)  I wish I had requested a table as the main area of the restaurant seemed really relaxed and intimate. I ended up being seated at a booth in the bar, directly next to the very loud kitchen. 

The waitress was reasonably friendly and promptly re-filled my water cup at least six times. I ordered the Alaskan Halibut & Jumbo Crab.  Within minutes she brought out a loaf of hot, freshly baked bread. It was delicious. My meal came out not long after that. My first impression was, holy crap, that is a TINY meal for $40!

The food was amazing, however. Lot's of flavor and cooked just right. Although I tried to pace myself, it was over all too soon. Immediately upon finishing, I was thinking I could have easily eaten three more just like it. A little bit later, after the meal had settled however, I felt very satisfied, if not quite full. 

My total bill, including the tip, came to just less than $50. As I stated above, that is a lot of money for me, and it will definitely limit how often I eat at this place.  I am sure I will try it again sometime however."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant.  It is easy to access and has an adorable ambiance both inside and out.  The service was friendly and efficient.  The food was delicious.  Really enjoyed my shrimp and grits.  My son enjoyed his plate of fried seafood and we both had plenty to bring home leftovers.  They offer kids meals and my friend enjoyed the gumbo.

There was only one negative to the trip.  My daughter (12 years old) accidentally stepped out of the car with her reusable coffee cup from home.  By the time we realized we were already walking in and it is HOT (getting to be summer in AZ) and we were all hungry.  We told her she shouldn't do that but proceeded into the restaurant.  At the hostess stand we were informed that she couldn't have the cup and that they could throw it away.  Instead of walking all the way back to the car or having the cup tossed she went outside and placed it on an out of the way table, to be picked up on the way out of the restaurant.  We weren't seated but a few minutes and an employee holding the cup walked to our table.  We were told the cup can't be out on the table because it might be thrown away (this was a risk we were willing to take).  At this point we walked it all the way back to the car.  It was just a silly damper on an otherwise very enjoyable meal and experience.  The cup could have been placed in my purse for goodness sake."}
{"text":"The best seafood house in Phoenix.  Prices are in the higher side but you get what you pay for!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, yes......YES!!!!!!!! What an amazing spot for some kick ass seafood. Met some friends here for dinner...This is what we ordered:

Mediterranean Calamari and OMG, It's spectacular. Crispy and tender calamari with artichoke hearts, capers & pepperoncini!!  We also ordered a cup of the andouille sausage and seafood gumbo. Yup, another mind blowing experience! So good. Make sure to mix it up well before you eat it, the way it's intended to be eaten. We also ordered (yes, we were hungry, don't judge), the filet mignon oscar. The only issue was there wasn't much lump crab meat, in fact it was next to nothing on the filet so they ended up taking that off our bill. Still so delish and they followed up and took care of us.

I highly recommend this place, great atmosphere and amazing food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is amazing! I've been there for their crawfish boils...so perfect and the best price for what you get anywhere in the valley! Any other time, the crawfish platter is my favorite. Actually everything is my favorite :) And for as busy as the place is, I still get my food quickly and an awesome wait staff is there for anything you need."}
{"text":"I just reached out to them because of something I saw on their to-go menu. I was transferred to a low energy to go person. I asked if they had a family pak item at their store I got a simple no we don't and that was it. there was no effort to maybe attempt to get me to look at something else. Family paks start at over 60 dollars so it would have been a nice ticket for them, but I guess they are doing so well they don't need or want that type of business. I have eaten there once and it was just Ok so not surprised about the interaction."}
{"text":"Holy Moly! This food is sooooo yummy! I came here while on vacay in Phoenix with a group of people. The restaurant is pretty huge and it was PACKED! Good thing we had reservations! We started off with the oysters, which I thought were tasty (though I'm no expert). Then we had the coconut shrimp, which was awesome! The breading was very tasty! Then I had the scallops which were phenomenal! So melt-in-your-mouth with a little kick to them! Finally we had to have the sweet potato pie. Holy Smokes did it ROCK! This is an absolute must try! The key lime pie was also good (not too sweet). This restaurant has quality food and quality service."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Only complaint is it's overpriced, but great for a special evening out."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. This place is amazing, never had a bad meal or experience. Some of the best seafood in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The wait was quoted as over an hour at 8 pm on a Friday night. We ended up sitting at the bar. Less than 10 minute wait for 2 people. The blackened gator bites were really good and Service at the bar was actually pretty fast. Food was delicious and the bartender/waiter did a great job."}
{"text":"Great, I mean talky great service today. Food is always good here. We stayed for a few hours for a meeting today and service was consistent the entire time. 

I certainly will be back."}
{"text":"Was at a spring training Dodger-DBack game today in the hot sun. Needed a place to be entertained.  Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen was just the ticket.   Came back to the hotel and then we went to the Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen without reservations.  We had to wait for awhile, but that was OK as it gave our party of 10 time to soak in the atmo.  The approach is a bit of  \"round the block\" but once you get there it is a huge complex of dining, bar and patio areas.  Eclectic crowd, especially for Phoenix.  They had a troubador playing a soft electric guitar and spillin' his lyrics out on the patio.  Lots of fried food.  Their seafood dishes looked tasty.  I asked where the salmon was caught and found out several of their seafood dishes were farm raised.  I am picky about eating fish that was caught in the wild and not farmed.  I had a deep fried chicken and shrimp dish with fries that was good.  Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen will probably not see me again as not really my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I have only eaten twice at Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen, once in Denver, CO and the other in Phoenix, AZ. Both visits were excellent! My second and most recent visit was at the Phoenix location. The restaurant was very busy, even still our wait was under our quoted time, by only a few minutes. Everyone from the bartender to the server were all friendly and accommodating. The live music playing outside was an added benefit. Management was also outstanding. We had a challenge with the timeliness of our meal and the manager was very helpful in resolving our problem. The food was outstanding, with nice portions too. Flavorful, creative, and well presented are just a few attributes describing the food. Please consider Southern California for a future location!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because this Pappadeaux is in the desert it's not as good as the one's in Texas. But I have been to one in Dallas and one in the Houston airport and both are much better.

Sorry but I don't remember what I had but I just wasn't impressed and didn't get the feeling the seafood was really fresh. I guess I will continue to look for a place to get fried seafood in Arizona.

If you are expecting Pappadeaux like it is in Texas don't go here.
If you are expecting Legal Seafood don't go here."}
{"text":"In town for work. Sat at the bar. Happy Hour app was very small, like 2 bites small but yummy. Cocktail was perfect, not too sweet. Stuffed shrimp was ok, but  not memorable. Well seasoned fries. If I was with the company of some friends seems like it would be a fun place to get together."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food is always good. I ordered the scallop and sweet pea risotto which was delicious but the scallops were a little sandy. My husband got the filet oscar which he absolutely loved. Our server Nora was really professional and pleasant and tried the best she could. On a Wednesday night, it was packed and really noisy in there as the tables are packed in tightly. Nora was super attentive but the kitchen was really slow. There were 4 of us and we were there for 2 hours. WAY too long! 
Other than sandy scallops and super slow service, we love this place and it's always good to bring friends.
We will be back but I won't order the sandy scallops."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Creole food and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was amazing. I ordered broiled shrimp with spaghetti squash which was nicely cooked and tasty. The fried catfish fillet was also very good. The calamari was a little spicey."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to this restaurant for many years. We had the best service from Brenda this past weekend and I had to share. She is worth requesting when you stop in to eat! Thank you Brenda for such great service! Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Clam chowder was piping hot and creamy delicious! Our waiter, Christian was delightful and attentive, an Awesome waiter ! We shared the PapaDeux platter so yummy and lots of good sample of crab cakes shrimp catfish and fries. We will be back! Bought the gift card special they have right. Ow! Good deal!"}
{"text":"oh nom nom nom nom here. I've been to the one in New Mexico - but for some reason, it didn't stand out as much there. I think it might have been the Lunch course.

THIS was definitely a much better experience.

We got here a little after 8 pm, a bit early for our 8:30 pm reservations. They had our table ready and whenever we were ready to go. They were uber accommodating - even when our party of 10 became a party of 8.

Brook was our server. AWESOME MAN. Fantastic suggestions, substitution, and all over awesomeness. Wished I lived closer to have this place all the time.

Wine cellar for our private party. You should ask - it fits about 10-12 people comfortably. 

What we ordered-
* Mississippi Catfish Opelousas - Blackened catfish with shrimp, oysters 
& jumbo lump crabmeat in a lemon garlic butter sauce with dirty rice ... It was so light, so flavorful. OH my. I totally understand why my friend LOVES this dish. $29.99
*Atlantic Salmon Yvette (11 oz. 26.95 .. 7 oz. 22.95) Char-grilled salmon with shrimp, crawfish, mushrooms & spinach, in a sherry white wine sauce, with dirty rice.
* Pappadeaux sampler - Fried fish filets (choice of catfish, tilapia or both), shrimp, blue crab cake, stuffed shrimp & stuffed crab with extra fried shrimp & crawfish)... the extra is what separates the seafood platter vs pappadeaux sampler. ($32.99)
*Oyster sampler appetizer - with both of their baked oysters (Oysters Pappadeaux - Baked oysters on the half shell with crabmeat, spinach & hollandaise and Oysters Baton Rouge - Oysters on the half shell baked with a Parmesan Romano cheese sauce) - $13.95, with three of each oyster.
*Appetizer Trio - Mini shrimp & crawfish fondeaux, fried alligator & hot smoked salmon* (we switched the salmon for Coconut shrimp) OH nom nom nom. This was one fantastic appetizer - can be shared or ordered as an entree - $22.99

Somewhat disappointed in their section of raw oysters - Gulf Coast and Blue point only.

Lobster tank in front, with their prices per pound. 

Will definitely come back especially now i know what I ordered. Pretty pricey, but totally worth the flavors and food. OH nom nom nom indeed"}
{"text":"I would go there everyday if I had the money it's super great food here the people are very nice and caring and super great food the best"}
{"text":"I've always heard people talk good about this place. And now I know why! This place is f****g amazing. Been here twice now I forgot to write the review lol first time had a seafood pasta that was amazing! With shrimp and scallops! Also tried the alligator. I will go back. I grew up eating tons of seafood and I know it's expensive but I know what I'm getting and how much I can get with the same money at the market. I wish it was just a bit less expensive and I would definitely would go more often."}
{"text":"Being someone that spent a lot of time in New Orleans, it's hard for me to give this place any more than 3 stars. Their food is \"OK\" but way over priced. 
The gumbo is not very gumbo like and their PoBoys need \"more\"

The drinks, however, will knock you out of your shoes! The bartenders are super friendly too!

I totally miss the Gulf Coast Oyster special since the oil spill....3.95 a dozen!  Not any more :( Ahh well. Life goes on.

I can't really suggest heading into Pappa for your seafood fix. There are better places in the valley."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the crispy Atlantic salmon & Maine Lobster!  What a wonderful dish!  The most moist salmon I have ever had, seasoned perfectly with lobster and grilled shrimp on top.  It was on a bed of super sweet roasted acorn squash.  My boyfriend ordered the Mississippi Catfish Opelousas.  It was amazing!  A huge portion of fish and seasoned well.  I like that this place is a made-from-scratch restaurant and you can customize your food.  I also love that they sell Vietti Moscato.  A good moscato is very hard to find at restaurants for some reason, and this is a really good one.  They even put fresh raspberries in it!  Would come back again and again if I lived in Phoenix.  Wish there was one in St. Louis!"}
{"text":"Good food, out of oysters, waiter had too many tables. Tossed the butter at us, and forgot to ask us if we wanted another drink as he rushed by to give us water"}
{"text":"We just had the most tastiest dinner. It was wonderful. Six of us had different menu items and many appetizers everything was cooked to perfection. The service was impeccable Ariel has wonderful knowledge of the menu. Such a joyful person thank you for a great 25th anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"My family and I always go to the Pappadeaux in Albuquerque so when we saw this one off the freeway we knew we HAD to stop for dinner.

We had a big group when we went but it really wasn't a problem for this place because it's such a large restaurant. The menu is extensive and heavy on the seafood which is awesome since it is delicious! We always get the fried alligator appetizer which is SO GOOD! I know it sounds gross but where the heck are you ever going to find ALLIGATOR?! Try it, especially with the sauce... YEAH! We have also tried the oysters on the half shell (great) and the fried oysters with fries (yum!)

For dinner I like to get the pasta mardi gras which is linguine with shrimp and sausage in a creamy marinara sauce. It has a bit of a kick to it which I like but the portion is really big so it's best to share. Crawfish etouffee is great and is a favorite of my dad. We have had the king crab as well which is yummy but can be hard to crack the shells and take apart. The filet mignon oscar was good but a little light on the crab meat that is on top of the steak. 

This place can get quite loud so be careful! Also can be a bit pricey but I believe the cost is less if you go for lunch."}
{"text":"We were given a gift card to try this out and we are impressed. Service was exceptional. Food was filling and yummy!! You have to try the lemonade drink and crab dip!! Those two were my favorite. I also enjoyed the one of a kind crème brûlée!!!"}
{"text":"The oysters Pappadeaux were out of this world and the bacon wrapped shrimp was equally as good!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints, large portions great southern atmosphere and the food is delicious. You have to get the crawfish trio, not on the menu and it's worth every bite. Fresh food cooked to perfection. Off the chain!"}
{"text":"if you're looking for authentic cajun, this is not the place.  it's more like Joe's Crab Shack with a Louisiana theme.  overpriced food, the servers/bartenders are too busy to be attentive .  I ordered a special redfish dish (which was not cheap) and the redfish had either been frozen for a long time or, most likely, microwaved.  tis was the deal-breaker.  everything was decent until I got my entree but eating rubbery-textured redfish was not a great way to top off a meal.  I have spent some time in New Orleans and LOVE cajun food and this place does it no justice!  and for what you have to pay for the food, you can pretty much fly to N'Awlins and have the real deal."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the crawfish ettouffee was the best I've had in a long time! The food itself should probably get 4 stars, however, our service was just plain bad, so I'm just going with 3 stars.

The outside patio area was really nice and they had live music and a bar outside."}
{"text":"A welcoming spot, strangely bare on weekends.  We don't have this place around our area so visiting r there is nothing much for me to complain about. Gumbo is quite tasty, the bread I think was complimentary but I devoured like it was a meal.  Drinks refreshing and pretty strong.  We got lucky and got a great server, so service was attentive.  Stay put, Papadeaux, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a great environment and the food is excellent. I recommend getting the alligator bites as an appetizer or their oysters.

Every lunch and dinner entree I have tasted has been top quality. The only reason that I do not give Papadeaux a 5 star rating is that all entrees are high price. I understand greeting crab stuffed crab claws and lobster being pricey, but typical Cajun dishes are $10-15 over priced. Expect a $75-100 check if getting an app with dinner."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a Pappadeaux's twice in my life; this experience was better than my first at least.  If you are from Louisiana, or travel there often, this place doesn't compare to the real deal.  Our party had the half-price oyster deal and ordered several orders.  They liked them, but I thought they were just OK.  It was a good value though.  I had ordered the new scallops and sweet pea risotto, and it was pretty tasty, but the portion size was way too small and way overpriced.  I only had 5 scallops on my plate and they were relatively small.  I felt like I could have gotten more scallops for less from the grocery store.  We got the bananas foster cheesecake for desert, which was pretty uninspiring to me.  Seemed like a regular cheesecake with very little topping whatsoever.  If it's not a traditional bananas foster desert, don't bother with it.  Also, there aren't very many non-seafood options on the menu!"}
{"text":"Pappadeaux used to have this oreo cookie mousse dessert thing

It was the best dessert ever in this world.  Ever.

Then they stopped carrying it.  So now I won't go back.  I protest Pappadeaux!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday dinner.  Everything was wonderful.  Super busy for Sunday afternoon.  The sweetie waitress,was outstanding.  I even got to pick which dessert I wanted for my dessert.  Wish I could work there"}
{"text":"I am now OBSESSED with Pappadeaux. My friend and I sat on the patio by the water fountain which was so cool. We ordered the lobster tails, shrimp cocktail, crab mac & cheese, and spaghetti squash. Lucky for us they messed up and brought over 6 lobster tails instead of two and everything was just so delicious. I 100% recommend & cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"Wow this place is great!! We came in town for the probowl and came to eat here. We had the gator appetizer and it was nice and tender. Catfish is very clean flavor. Price is a bit up there but well worth it. A must visit next time. My server Kamarie was great."}
{"text":"OMG!!! So good!!!!  I was in AZ for work and I asked a colleague to do lunch and she recommended Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen.  I absolutely love this place.  It was a beautiful March day and we sat outside.  It wasn't too hot or too cold, just perfect.  The service was great with tons of parking. 

We ordered the following:
Shrimp and Scallop Orecchiette Pasta ($30) - It has shrimp, scallops, oreccheitte pasta, lump crab, asparagus in a creamy parmesean vodka sauce.  It was delicious.  The shrimp was huge, the scallop was rich and delicious.  Everything came very well together.

Grilled Redfish and Jumbo Shrimp ($34) - My colleague had this and it was fantastic.  I was able to taste the Redfish and it was flaky and delicious.  This is the dish my colleague always order. 

Cup of Seafood Gumbo ($7): So good.  I asked for spicy and it definitely was not spicy.  I should have asked for extra, extra  spicy.  Lots of flavor with good pieces of sausage and seafood and rice.

When I'm in Phoenix again, I want to try their Crawfish Etouffee."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. And they were happy to accommodate to gluten free or other allergy needs.
Very good fruit ice tea."}
{"text":"My ex co-worker/friend love this place/ go as often as we can!! The service is great/the food is great/the white wine spritzers are beautiful/great  :)  :) This location is east of the freeway on 26th ave Phx  :)"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite seafood places. Went on Father's Day. It was really crowded but still enjoyed the food when I finally got it."}
{"text":"Very busy place 
Great food, we have been going for years. We have noticed the serving have gotten really small while the price has gone up crab cakes are totally not as good as they used to be. My husband loves the food there. We will definitely be back! The price is really high!!!!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy the experience of dining at Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen. Probably the best selection of seafood items in the Greater Phoenix area. We both ordered salmon dishes. My wife's was med-rare and she ordered well. It was quickly taken care of and corrected. 

The service was excellent. Our waiter, Ed, helped make the evening a good time. He was efficient, but took time to chat and make sure it was a nice experience for us. 

We like the way the restaurant is decorated to add to the experience. From the outside curb appeal, to the entry way, to the inside, you feel like you have left Phoenix and are in some New Orleans restaurant."}
{"text":"I grew up in AZ and still have family there so every trip home going to Pappadeaux's is a MUST!  They have the greatest food and a huge selection even for those who don't like seafood.  They have great Oysters and Jose the oyster shucker is the best!  The staff there is always warm and inviting and even when you have to wait on weekends they have a great live band out on the patio.  It's always packed so I would recommend reservations.  I usually get the steamed muscles and the cedar block salmon which is sooo yummy it's served with asparagus that is the best I have ever had in a restaurant.  If you are going to Phoenix or live there, this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! 

Get me some lobster bisque and the Mardi Gras pasta and I'm all yours! 

Happy Hour here is pretty darn good because the prices become more affordable. I feel that you get what you pay for at Pappadeaux's in terms of food and service, but anytime you can get that with a discount it definitely gets better! 

I love all the desserts, but the sweet potato pecan pie with a cup of coffee really makes the evening paired with a side of Jazz on the covered patio."}
{"text":"Yuk.

Grease, grease and more grease 

If you like fatty fried food this is your spot 

If you like Cajun spice.  This is your spot.  

If you want fresh, clean, healthy seafood.   Don't go 

Plus the prices are outrageous."}
{"text":"I'm too fat and happy to write this properly now but holy schnikeys,  Batman, that was some good grub.  And atmosphere.  And service.

More later."}

Best seafood in Phoenix hands down. It's always packed and you could be in for a wait if you don't make reservations which I always do. It's a big place that with a lot of people eating, drinking, and enjoying so it can be loud. The food and the service are top notch. Well worth the $$$"}
{"text":"Probably the most expensive food without the flavor.  Maybe it was my dish?   Blue crab...  spongy and boring.  Thank goodness for the baked potatoes &dinner rolls...   that's all I ate.  Definitely won't be spending big bucks here...Red Lobster is better ..."}
{"text":"Surf and Turf rock! Had my birthday part-ay there and it was fun. Great service and we had a ball. Appetizers were amazing too."}
{"text":"Came her this spring and last. The shrimp and grits are to die for!!! Shrimp have the perfect grilled flavor mixed with grits cooked with the perfect consistency and loaded with cheese. Bread and butter are alwaya a plus. Add a few good alcoholic beverages and creme brulee...you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I prefer my food from the land and not the sea so seafood is not a dining favorite of mine. My picky style has never resisted me for taking up an opportunity to dine at Pappadeux as they have on shore tasty items on the menu. I always seem to dive into the crispy chicken fingers along with the wide variety of sides, however my last visited I was tempted to try the broiled half chicken. Boy was I impressed. It was so flavorful and fell right off the bone. Not only was it not dry but it was juicy. Matter of fact those seafood eaters who dined with me tasted a sample and wanted to clean my plate. Too bad and so sad for them they will have to come back because I ate it all. Along with the spaghetti squash and a bed of white rice. 

The great thing about this restaurant is they have a wide variety of options to choose from. A large dining area for larger parties and even a private room. You can dine casually to a romantic date or even have a party the whole crew will be impressed. They even have a full size bar with the same great menu. 

Pappadeaux the place to go!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with some friends a few days ago and was not disappointed!! My server, Andrew, was very attentive and was super nice. I ordered oysters and a few others that were all pretty good. My daughter ordered the crab mac n cheese and fries and although the mac n cheese looks like a small portion, don't be fooled! She was full halfway through the plate. Some orders my friends did not like, but everyone has different taste buds. The bill came and was a whopping $300. Get ready to splurge if you eat here."}
{"text":"Craw fish season! Came here last night with a couple of friends for oysters and crawfishes. It was delicious. The crawfishes are juicy and big. Our server was nice and attentive. The environment inside however is quite loud since the tables are close by. If you have a large group of people, help to make reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"I order togo which was very fast on everything was correct.  Had a couple of drinks while I waited.  The N'awlins punch is awesome with fresh watermelon.  I found a new drink instead of the Swamp Thing.  Brook the bartender was GREAT... THANKS for a great experience when my second drink was not right."}
{"text":"Not sure how I feel about this restaurant.
Came here for the first time last night.

I was given silverware with a visibly dirty disgusting napkin, had to ask for another set. Waitress never offered drink refills, had to ask. Very very busy and only the large party tables really received attention, our table was not as important.
Lastly , asked to see dessert tray. Picked out bread pudding then later told they were out. Offered another dessert complimentary but then we were charged for it.
Good grief."}
{"text":"I frequent the Pappadeaux in Denver which has been consistently excellent over the past 10 years. 

The Pappadeaux here in Phoenix, while \"never\" up to the standards of the Devnver franchise, was always worth the trip. Not so on my past 2 visits, while the ambience is still up to standard, the food quality, service, and bar energy has dropped off a cliff. 

The place was still packed with customers, I guess there's no accounting for taste.

I can't see myself going back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cajun Combo not amazing but very tasteful it was beautifully cooked and was buttery smooth only thing I did not like was the saltiness of it but otherwise great atmosphere and wonderful crew."}
{"text":"Wonderful fried alligator and \"ok shrimp gumbo\". Seems like the bowl has shrunk on the gumbo, or it differs by location. 

We came here for lunch. The wait on a table was about 30 minutes and the fried Alligator came immediately. However, it took over 35 minutes for our meals to come.

Seems coming on a crowded Thursday business lunch was a less than stellar idea. Generally, I've enjoyed this chain in other cities, but was a little less enthusiastic about this location and the food quality."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and i'm in love!!! 

I think that Crawfish nights are Asians' night. When happy hours hit, I felt like I'm back in the old country. 

If you have ghetto nails with all kind of crystal-ness, be careful not to choke on the crystals when you go to lick the deliciousness off your fingers."}
{"text":"The most amazing food!! Wonderful atmosphere. Service was wonderful! I had the Halibut and spaghetti squash and my boyfriend the oysters. Will definitely go back!! Wish they had one I the east valley hint hint, but the trip was worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Food was good experience not so good. Was told an hour wait, waited an hour an forty five minutes after complaining. Went to the bathroom and noticed six open tables. Waiter forgot our orders and never filled our drinks, and took forever to box up our leftovers.  For a 110 dollar tab for two. Not my top choice."}
{"text":"First time and last...very dissapointed w service and food not good at all...guess that we are  not coming back. Joe's Crabs is.the best."}
{"text":"We walked in and were completely impressed by the ambiance and the overall look of the entire place.  We stared with the shrimp cocktail - which had Fresh gulf shrimp, chunky avocados & pico de gallo in a spicy cocktail sauce.  I can say, this was the best shrimp cocktail I have ever had.  We also split a ceasar salad which was perfect.  For dinner, I had the Mahi blackened over dirty rice .  The fish was fresh and spicy - all their fish is flown in daily.  My date had the Pasta Mardi Gra - Linguine tossed with crawfish, andouille sausage & crimini mushrooms in a marinara cream sauce topped with jumbo grilled shrimp. . .  This dish was quite spectacular... We thought we were in New Orleans...  For desert, we had NY Cheesecake - with fresh strawberries in a sauce - topped with fresh whipped cream - I can't think of any cheese cake I have ever had that was better than this...  The desert plate they bring to the table has all the deserts on there - they all looked amazing- quite a difficult choice... WOW - the entire dinner was perfect!  AND on top of it all, our service was top notch.  SAM was excellent - he talked with us and explained the items we had questions on, cleaned the table in between courses, and gave us fresh silver ware - along with always keeping our drinks full.  And he had a great attitude - he acted like he wanted to make our dinner very special.  The manager came and talked with us also, and thanked us for coming in.  Quite impressive.  This was one of the most memorable dinners we have had, from the time we walked in the door until we walked out.  We were completely impressed with Pappadeaux - and can't wait until we return.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! My server was Matt and he was awesome. I asked him for his recommendations and he knew them right off the bat.  He has many favorites as you really can't go wrong but I decided to go with his top picks: the lobster bisque to start with and the Jumbo Shrimp brochette with dirty rice. SO GOOD. When I got there, they had just opened 30 mins prior and already they were pretty busy. The place is clean, excellent food, and marvelous service. I'm definitely making this my go-to spot for my monthly business visits. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy a trip over to Pappadeaux but last night was the worst dining experience I've had in years. We were quoted a 10-20 min wait time... no biggie... ended up waiting 55 min to be seated. It is spring training and spring break so not a big deal because we did arrive at 7pm. The problem is we left at 10:30pm! I ordered the seasonal craw fish as an appetizer since I had an hour to look over the menu I ordered right away. Took 45 min to get the craw fish out and when they came there was an old dehydrated piece of corn with scraps of potatoes. I had watched other tables getting several pieces of corn with large potatoes so we must have been given the \"left overs\". It was truly pathetic. We ended up just getting the gumbo since we had already filled up on bread and my real motivation to eat here was the dessert. We ordered two desserts and after 15 min our waitress only brought out one (she forgot the other one). Our waitress was nice but just not good at her job. Every time she knew she messed up she would have the manager come to our table instead of just explaining to us what had happened. It was a long confusing $50 app, soup, and dessert. I would recommend going at 2pm for a stress free dinner!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my new favorite seafood restaurants in town. I had my first experience here on Christmas Eve to celebrate my birthday with friends and I must say, even though they were crazy busy, the service was excellent and the food was very fresh and delicious!
Of course my only 'beef' is that it's a bit pricey. However, it was worth it for the freshness of the food. 

I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a great seafood restaurant in Phoenix area. Even though it's a chain restaurant, they delivered! Two thumbs up from this super taster!"}
{"text":"I really love this place!! Nothinglike a fun Sunday meal with my family to make me love it even more. We stuffed ourselves with delish catfish, fried shrimp , and tasty hazelnut Mahi. Service from Rocky was 
really fast , effiecient without that fake cloying attitude. Felt like we were
the center of the restaurant. Funny how things like fast drink refills, quick service and welltime plate removal can do that.  
And here is the kicker of the evening ..I know have ordered or tasted every dessert on thier dessert tray, scary but true. Did you know that three of their desserts are made fresh there the rest including cheesecakes are made in Texas and brought in. I got the fresh Brulee  . yummy.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I come to Pappadeaux regularly. I love this place everything is always good and fresh. The atmosphere is great,service, and southern vibe makes me feel like I'm at a restaurant in New Orleans. Thanks Pappadeaux!..I'll always be a fan."}
{"text":"I have always liked Pappdeaux. I remember eating all you can eat Lobster many years ago at one of their Chicagoland venues. I wasn't planning on going here the other night but just decided to dine here on a whim when I was traveling North on the 17 heading for another restaurant. The parking lot was about 90% full. I waited for one of the kitchen help to leave since he thought it was okay to take up 2 parking spots. 

There was a 45 minute wait on a Friday night which is not unusual and not a big deal for me. After being seated we ordered drinks and checked out the extensive menu. I decided to go with the catfish and fries which was in the $14 dollar range. I have to say that I was not happy with how my entrée was plated. Two fried catfish filets on top of the fries, completely cutting the fries off from plain sight. So how do you eat the fries? I transferred the catfish to my bread plate. I noticed that all of the other diners around me had all of their food presented in a professional manner. I'm guessing that they either ran out of plates or just thought that since my entrée was only $14 bucks that it didn't matter. I've been to greasy spoon places that did a better job separating the fish from the fries in a basket.

The Catfish was just okay for me. The fries were actually nicely seasoned and delicious. I will not order this entrée again since it was unspectacular. In fact, the next time I go to Pappadeaux, I am going to try to snag one of those semi-private outdoor areas in back. This seating backs into the gorgeous grounds around Pappadeaux. Also, the lighting around the restaurant and parking lot was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Unusually disappointing experience!  My husband, My daughter and I went to pappadeaux for dinner on Sunday evening.  We know it is usually busy so we decided to beat the dinner rush and get there early...around 5:45pm.  We put our names in and were told it would be a 15 minute wait for a table.  Perfect ( we thought).  In the meantime, more and more people began filling the patio waiting for tables.  We watched people come and overheard many of them talking about how long it would take to be seated.  45 minutes later, as we watched people who walked in after us being seated, including a table of 10,  I asked to check our place in line to make sure that there wasn't an error in their system and was told people were just eating slow and hanging around and that it would be another 15-30 minutes!  I walked through the restaurant and saw that there were many empty tables.  Mind you...there were only 3 of us.  Needless to say, when our number came up, we had to stand at the hostess desk for nearly another 10 minutes to have someone come meet us to seat us.  Once seated, our server was friendly and attentive. But I can't leave out the fact that people who put their names in after us already had their food at the time we were seated.  Food is delicious but expensive so for that type of treatment, Pappadeaux can wait a long time for our return to repay for the treatment that we received."}
{"text":"Several people suggested that I revisit Pappadeaux and since it's close and I often eat seafood out I did.

I had a very different exsperience this time. I sat on the patio this time and I found the patio very pleasant and comfortable.

We started with the in house made Hot Smoked Salmon appetizer. We received a generous portion of salmon topped with a mustard herb sauce and seasoned thin crisp bread toasts. The salmon seemed like it was slow cooked as it just melted like butter in your mouth. I also liked that it was lightly smoked and not too much so you could get the yummy taste of the sauce with it. I thought this was a masterfully prepared dish and this one really wowed me as I would like to get it again some time.

We received our dinners. My husband ordered the Gulf Coast Redfish Pontchartrain and I got the Halibut with spaghetti squash. I taste the redfish and this one is perfect, it's fresh, tasty and prepared perfect. Then I taste the Halibut and it's overcooked and dry. I sort of feared sending it back since it was still edible but my husband convinced me to do so. We flagged the waiter over and he took care of it right away and sent the manager over.  The manager and the waiter were extremely kind and didn't at all make me feel guilty for sending the fish back. They also remade my husband's dinner so he could have a fresh one with me and also gave him the option of nibbling on the current one he had if he wanted to. The manager even suggested having some salad or soup while we wait he really couldn't be more hospitable.

We receive our new dinners and both were very good. My Halibut was MUCH BETTER as it was tasty and flaky and moist. The Spaghetti squash was good it was slightly sweet and buttery and the redfish was nailed perfect again, it was really delicious. The manager checked on us and said we could have dessert on them. We enjoyed the dinners very much and over ate a bit so we didn't have room for dessert but we saw someone walk by with a dessert tray and they looked really good.

This was an educational exsperience for me. 
I know I can come back to Pappdeaux because the food will be good or they will do their best to make it again right for you.

I will try to be a better diner and say something to my server if I need too."}
{"text":"We started off with some alligator bites. Very well cleaned, and wasn't gamey at all. The dipping sauce was really good too - buttery and not too spicy. We ordered gumbo - which the flavor was a bit bland. Lots of shrimp and seafood, and the juicy andouille sausage. But the broth was lacking and super runny...

I was definitely a big fan of the Pasta Mardi Gras! HOLY MOLY!!! the cream sauce was delightful :) Abundant pieces of shrimp, sausage, scallops and crawfish! Swimming in that tasty cream and tomato sauce. The whole bowl of dish was accompanied by a buttery garlic crostini that was used to sop up all the leftover sauce. Can't stop talking about that sauce!

The servings of the dishes were huge and overwhelming - but i'm definitely not complaining. The service was overall good - the food came out in lighting speed."}
{"text":"Jalissa was amazing. It was my first date and she made it amazing.  She was quick, amazing, and friendly. The food was great.  If she wasn't our server I'd walk out."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food and fresh seafood.  Our waiter gave us the heads up that the Crawfish Étouffée is spicy and the item most sent back for heat.  He suggested a trio of crawfish:  fried, ettouffee and cream sauce.  Good call because it was definitely spicier than I like.  I would definitely go back to Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen."}
{"text":"Love this place for fish!  I enjoy flying though Houston airport just so I can eat at their restaurant during lay overs.  It is very pricey $$$$!!!

I always get a great meal, but not everything is a \"Wow\" on the menu.  Friends from time to time get a dish there that is at best - average.  I find that if you get their specials, or fish with a sauce topped with crab and shrimp or crawfish you can't go wrong.  The Calamari has always been really good too!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal here.  The mussels were cooked to perfection; fried alligator was spicy with a great dipping sauce, shrimp gumbo, delicious and  the étouffée, to die for.  Our waiter was excellent, one of our party was very late arriving so we were ordering courses one at a time, never fazed him at all.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this restaurant as I heard good things.  The food was okay, but everything took FOREVER and they were not that busy.  I probably will not go there again."}
{"text":"I would like to extend a formal apology for not walking into this place sooner. It honestly blew away all my expectations! The food, the atmosphere, and the service were all absolutely wonderful. Our server was Brent and he was fantastic; sweet, quick, and very polite and happy. 
It has been a while since I've set foot in this place. Not because of any slight or grievance on my part, but because of a long string of bad luck. This place is not for people looking to save money, but if you're tired of being practically robbed at your local Red Lobster, you might want to give this place a try. Better options on the menu, infinitely better quality, just at a little higher price, but to me the price was worth it.
Started with the calamari appetizer. Delish! Extra points for the fried artichoke hearts. Entrees were the Pasta Mardi Gras (for me) and the Scallop & Crab Pappardelle Pasta. Good lord was the Mardi Gras good. Actually grilled shrimp (instead of browned shrimp dowsed in liquid smoke), crawfish (I know it's lazy on my part but I was so happy they had already just put the meat of the crawfish into the dish instead of placed whole ones in; I'm clumsy by nature so I would have made a mess), and andouille sausage (which I've never tried before but found I liked it greatly) all in a marinara creams sauce (my favorite). I highly recommend this dish because I couldn't find one fault (not that I go looking, but the other seafood restaurants near me always manage to somehow magnify their faults when I visit so it's hard not to just expect mistakes). I wish I'd had room for desert because I'm sure it would have been wonderful, but then again it gives me an extra reason to come back. Please don't be scared of the prices because in my mind it's completely worth it due to everything backing the prices up. This is a great place for once in a while special occasion type outings! Especially for people who are fed up with the subpar seafood most places like to tout out of their kitchens!"}
{"text":"This spot is as good as it gets for Seafood in the West Valley, nothing else to say!  AMAZING in every way!"}
{"text":"It is as excellent as the one in the Chicago suburbs.  The food is awesome and the atmosphere is charming.   We had the alligator, crabs cakes, crawfish trio and the 1/2 chicken.  All were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I usually choose this restaurant for my birthday dinner. Their food is absolutely delicious! Tonight they did not disappoint. We started with the crab and spinach dip. I had the Pasta New Orleans which is fettuccini noodles in a pink Cajun creme sauce with lump crab, grilled shrimp, mushrooms and tomatoes. My husband had Mississippi Catfish Opelasoosas which was Cajun grilled catfish with lump crab, mussels and shrimp with a creme sauce and dirty rice. Their dirty rice is amazing! We both took left overs home and we are pretty big eaters. We both got a cocktail and my husband got a Caesar salad. The total was ~$106 before gratuity. The service was great. I loved the atmosphere, such a beautiful patio. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful but can be pretty loud. There is usually live music on the patio on the weekends too. Also they take reservations!"}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant. My boyfriend and I had sworn off any restaurant that had served seafood after many awful dinners but one of my clients had recommended this place... After looking over the menu several  times online, I figured it would be worth trying. We will only be coming back here! Our waiter, Kyle, was very attentive and took the time to go over the menu with us. We had alligator and oysters as appetizers, they definitely hit the spot and salmon and the Alaskan king crab for our dinners. I couldn't be more pleased with how everything turned out and I can't wait to go back! Even their drinks were delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Went here to try some new orleans food with my girlfriend and we had a great time. The location is a bit to be desired because its next to the freeway and theres only one access point but overall a very nice place."}
{"text":"This is the spot for a little bit of Nola in the desert. I thought this would be like Applebee's with seafood-- I didnt have high expectations. Instead, i was pleasantly suprised to see quality of seafood to be much higher than anticipated. I had some Alaskan crab which was delicious. It wasnt cheap but you get what you pay for. Being fron the northwest, I'm excited to have somewhete with some good seafood close by."}
{"text":"First time ever going there had a few months back and the food was phenomenal I love seafood. They had a wonderful menu, they even had crocodile puffs that tasted just like chicken. Sounds funny I know but my boyfriend and his family and I went and I have the best time ever the interior is really really authentic, mixed with the southern Louisiana and Cajun look. So totally would recommend it to people little bit pricey but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I came here on March 25th for my boyfriends birthday as a surprise dinner. Let me tell you, I had no idea what to expect and it was more than I could've imagined. This is my boyfriends favorite restaurant, which is why I brought him, and now my absolute favorite as well. We started off with an appetizer; a dozen blue point oysters. For people who don't know me, I love pretty much all seafood except oysters and squid (I used to love squid but the texture freaks me out. Maybe someday I'll love it again) but my boyfriend wanted me to try it, even though I knew previously I didn't like it. So I did. He put lemon on it and there was 3 sauces to choose from. There was one that reminds me of soy sauce mixed with wasabi, like a person would dip their sushi in. But I'm not sure if that was what it was. But I put that on mine and it was actually really good. So officially I like oysters now!! And then we both got a soup cup. He got the lobster bisque and I got the Louisiana seafood gumbo which I have ALWAYS wanted to try! Both soups were super yummy. I was very impressed. So far I had not been let down! Next was our actual meal. I got the pasta Mardi Gras and my boyfriend got the grilled Caribbean lobster tail. My pasta was amazing. I've always been big on pasta. The sauce was tasty and it has sausage and shrimps in it. My boyfriends included lobster, mashed red potatoes and broccolini. His was good too. Lastly, I had told the waitress by the name of devyn (I think that's how she spelled it) who by the way was very nice and friendly. She had great customer service. If you go, definitely ask to be seated in her area!! Anyways I told her that it was my boyfriends birthday so at the end they offered complimentary dessert. They had so many good ones to choose from. We picked the banana pudding. Haha thinking about it makes me hungry and my mouth water. I've had banana pudding before. I usually only like my family's cause it's a family recipe but pappadeux's knows how to make some amazing banana pudding. Lastly a couple things, if you are going for a special occasion, I recommend making a reservation. I was so glad I made a reservation. When we got there it was so packed, inside and out. Second, the place is beautiful. If you can, and you know it's going to be a nice day, I'd say sit outside. We didn't get to, but that's okay. Thirdly, everyone there is nice and quick and efficient. Please check this place out! They deserve some more good business.  I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Dropped in for HH on a Friday, plenty of seating.  The service wasn't too bad, but the food was unimpressive:

Catfish beignet-  basically just deep fried catfish but I'm a fan of catfish and couldn't tell what was in the batter
Crispy orange shrimp- not bad, tasty
Fried calamari-  standard
Mini fondeaux- best thing we ordered...get this!
Crispy alligator-  \"tastes like chicken\"...it really does.  I already knew this, but tried it for pure novelty reasons
Oysters-got a  dozen, but not on the HH menu

We weren't sure what Phoenix had to offer, but it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite seafood restaurant.  I could not wait to get to Phoenix to go to the restaurant.  I shared the combo plate with my husband since it is so much food.  We were not disappointEd.  My husband also had the gumbo which he enjoyed.  I also enjoy their catfish.  I definitely will make it one of my stops when I go to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Every chance I get when near Pappadeaux I will hit it.  The food is always great! We were doing a foodie road trip to the Phoenix area to hit some select spots.  Pappadeaux was the #1 spot for us to go!  Well worth the drive from Las Vegas.   I had the catfish blackened and dirty rice both were great.  I have been to locations in Denver, San Antonio and Austin worth it every time and every where!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very good but expensive. More upscale and definitely worth the money. Yelp needs to changes the pricing range to $$$ though, it's misleading and needs to be updated. Please update it."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux is always a \"yes\" for me. Came here most recently on my birthday with my husband and infant son.... 4:30pm on a Saturday which was early enough to beat the rush, so there wasn't a wait when we got there. We were seated promptly and our waitress was pleasant and prompt with our menu and drinks. She told me they were out of the Crab claws that came with the Alaskan Halibut Piccata entree I wanted and what the substitution would be. I was ok with the substitution and ordered anyway. Once my food arrived the substitution Jumbo lump crabmeat was a joke, I could barely see any. I told the waitress. She took it back to the kitchen and the manager came over. The manager said she'd make sure they corrected the issue and took 50% off my check and gave me a free birthday desert. The food came back to my table and was fixed with the added  crab meat that was enough to see and taste. The Bayou cake was everything. They made an unpleasant substitution issue better. I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Pappadeaux and will definitely return. The manager Arizonnia was gracious and kind."}
{"text":"Been here many times and even had an event for 20 people.  Best Sea Food place in Phoenix.  Service is always 5 stars and the staff is always great.  Try the seafood gumbo, oysters and lobsters.  I had a 4lb lobster there and it was the best."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner recently, for a party of eight. Place was pretty crowded and busy. But our service never suffered, food was very delicious. In fact, the coconut shrimp was my favorite for the night. Seems like they were able to get everyone seated in a timely matter through out the evening. It does get a little noisy. Food was very good, service was really good, never had to request anything refills. Since I am not a huge seafood person, I also had a very good Caesar Salad. 
Overall we had a very good experience,"}
{"text":"The best advice that I can give is that if you plan to dine at Pappadeaux, plan to arrive early.  This place is positively packed later in the evening! Still, if you're ready to set aside the money to have a good night, you'll probably get it here.  

The restaraunt is extremely customer-service oriented with very polite employees who attempt to fulfill all your needs.   They'll even offer suggestions on what items to select depending on what your party is looking for, very helpful! 

On this particular trip I settled on the Crawfish Etouffee and ordered a Bloody Mary from the bar.  Between my meal and our appetizers (we went with the combo platter and pan-fried frog legs) I can say that I was totally satisfied by the end of the night.   Things were noisy but we were in the mood to relax and have fun and the atmosphere was certainly condusive to doing just that.   

The food may not have been particularly authentic compared to real Cajun/Creole food but it was completely satisfying and I was surprised that my drink was relatively inexpensive for its size and for a bar inside a restaraunt in the middle of the city.   While it can get expensive fast at Pappadeaux, the folks here definitely earn their money.  The live music on the patio was certainly a plus as well."}

{"text":"Great fresh seafood shipped in daily! Great atmosphere. I always love to sit at the bar. Most importantly... the service is the best! Every server i ever got is well trained at customer service. Friendly and very professional. Great place."}
{"text":"Marcus was our waiter and he was seriously the best! Our first time there and will definitely be back. He was so knowledgeable about EVERYTHING on the menu!"}
{"text":"Even though we had a reservation we still had to wait. They have a 15 minute \"grace\" window which I have never heard of before.  We order the calamari app and it was fantastic. 

The entree is where they struggled.  We both ordered the shrimp and grits.  The shrimp was tough due to being over cooked.  It tasted like rubber.   Very disappointing as we had a wonderful experience at the Dallas location.  Unfortunately, the Phoenix restaurants food quality has gone down hill."}

{"text":"Some think the term \"It is what it is\" is stupid. 
I think the saying \" I hate fish that tastes fishy\" is stupid. 
Especially when the person saying it  just happens to be the Summer's Eve poster child and coincidentally, your date for the evening.

I've eaten here since they opened, trying everything on their menu at one time or another, even some things not on the menu. 
If you don't see the cedar planked salmon on the menu, ask for it. 

You'll never tell another soul how you don't like fishy fish again after eating this salmon...it's the most un-fishy-est, yet fishy-est fish fish dish you'll ever eat. 
If that makes any sense.

You do however have your date to contend with afterwards. Or did you forget?
Oh well.
It is what it is."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful ambience. I highly recommend this place for special occasions. The restaurant has a lovely Patio area if you want to avoid the noise inside. We ordered few drinks and crispy calamari for appetizers, which didn't disappoint. My husband and I ordered pasta Mardi grass and scallops shrimp pasta. Both were delicious. I ordered creme brûlée which was out of the world. Overall, I give 5 stars and highly recommend this place for finger licking sea food."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times and each and every time I HAVE to get the alligator.
I love almost everything on the menu. It's all worth trying. Just watch the deep fried platters...there is such a thing as too much deep fried food on one plate. It can tend to get a bit overwhelming.
I think my only complaint is that the service always kinda seems a little slow and the prices are a bit much. I mean, I understand that seafood prices can be a bit much but they seem to seriously jack up the prices at this place.
I love the little dessert tray they have to show you what they have on the dessert menu that night. I'm a visual type of person and it's just so helpful. They're desserts are really good too so if you can manage to leave room for them, I suggest you try something."}
{"text":"I love this place I go for my birthday every year. Their creme brulee is to die for. The salmon is off the hook and I love all their appetizer.;m  The one thing I not a fan of is their clam chowder it wasn't up to my standards. Love their lobster bisque though and would recommend that. The fried stuff is a little heavy but my husband loves it so there a little of everything."}
{"text":"Great seafood and steak.  Love surf and turf and getting it from here, I know it's extremely fresh and tasty.  Great place to take a date or meet up with friends or take your clients to.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We tried to make reservations about an hour ahead of time but they were booked up for reservations.  But not all tables can have a reservation.  So we decided to just go anyway and were seated right away.  The place is huge and has more tables than I could count.  The bar area is also very large with many booths and tables.  The menu had so many choices it was hard to decide.  So many cajun dishes too.

Our appetizer was shrimp cocktail.  It came with 9 shrimp instead of the usual 6 served at most places.  The cocktail sauce had a half teaspoon of straight horseradish sauce for those who may want to kick it up a bit.  We prefer less kick and dipped around the sauce.  It was a great way to start the meal.

My wife and I split a small order of fried shrimp (8). It was served already split in separate plates which was nice. The shrimp were butterflied, light and crispy, delicious.  She also ordered the stuffed shrimp and a baked potato loaded.  The shrimp were rolled in a rich crab stuffing which was seasoned perfectly.  The baked potato was huge, hot and smothered with all kinds of goodies (butter, sour cream, bacon, chives, celery).  She ordered the smaller portion that came with two stuffed shrimp.  If you get an appetizer this is the size you should get, more than she could eat and she loved every bite. 

I ordered the Shrimp Creole.  It came with a side of cheese grits with andouille mixed in.  The creole was not too spicy like a lot of places.  The sauce was full of veggies and chunks of tomato.  It was outstanding and worthy of a repeat order.
 
My wife had a frozen margarita blended and sipped on it throughout dinner.  I had Cabernet Sauvignon by the glass.  Our server was sweet, spunky, and very attentive.  She was enthusiastic and genuinely wanted us to enjoy ourselves and our dinner.  We both probably ate too much but everything was cooked and seasoned so well, it was almost impossible to stop eating.  A truly memorable meal which these days is hard to find."}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed here. We've been customers for years and have always had delicious food, amazing service, and a great dining experience. This is a favorite of ours for special occasions. It is worth the long wait on the busy days. We'll keep returning as long as they keep up the great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Wish we had one in california. everyone's dish was amazing. I had the crispy salmon with scallop, shrimp and crab meat and talk about seafood overload, but in a good way. each savory bite melted in my mouth and although i wanted to eat it all up I was full by the time I was halfway done with my meal. that combined with the voodoo cocktail and brownie dessert made my night. Nichole was super awesome and very patient with my friends and I."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the 1st time. The experience was okay, I may have given it 5 stars if I actually got everything I ordered.  I was really looking forward to trying the clam chowder,  but when it never came with my meal I was disappointed & decided to be happy with the food I did get; which ended up being a challenge. The stuffed shrimp sound better on the menu than they actually taste. The mashed potatoes tasted as if they came out of a box, which is surprising considering how much they charge for them. The best part of the meal was when my husband kindly let me try a bite of his lobster bisque.... and I don't think I've ever tasted anything so delicious!!  that one bite is the reason I gave this review 4 stars instead of one. I will go back here again but only to get a to go order of the lobster bisque!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Had the almond crusted snapper for lunch.  It was the absolute best fish I have ever had!  We also had Greek Salad, Calamari and a pasta dish.  Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite with the little guy. Sat immediately by a young host. Server came by quickly and we skipped the intro as we have been here multiple times. Order the chargrilled halibut, crawfish étouffée and a Lafayette topping. Our server Ben brought us a cold glass a milk and a tall Kilt Lifter. Life is good. Infant loves fish and crab. Was out in a flash and had a few good laughs."}
{"text":"Love this place. The waiting area outside is cozy. I've never had a bad meal. Great specials too."}
{"text":"Bleh. If you like deep fried, breaded seafood for an exorbitant amount of money, you'll love this place. My boyfriend likes this place so I've given it 3 tries. The first time was an epic fail, horrible service and cold food. Second time, didn't really like my food. Third time just got a blackened fish, it was okay but way too much in price. Not my cup of tea but apparently those who do like it love it, because they are always busy. So, to each their own."}
{"text":"Had such a great time and meal, I would recommend Pappadeaux  for sea food. So many great choices, crawfish, frog legs, alligator, oyster . The Manager \"Dawson\" was awesome dealing with my family. It will be a dinner experience we will talk about forever. Can't wait for our next trip there for dinner, I just wish it wasn't so far from us (about an hour). Many thanks to Dawson and our server for an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"My favorite things here are the fried alligator and for my entree I always get the bacon wrapped shrimp, it's to die for and by far the best thing on the menu. Such a unique flavor I love coming here ... oh and the swap things are a must try!"}
{"text":"Been on our to-try list for months, and we finally made it.  Sorry, we won't be hurrying back

First, order two glasses of wine at a time.  That way, you'll get one decent sized serving.  Had the catfish po-boys.  Huge, but something was lacking.  We just didn't think much of the sauce, kind of a strange flavor for Nawlins, which is where I go to compare po-boys.  We would have been happier with a smaller sandwich, if it had some flavor.  Or I would have ordered a catfish plate, but how can you eat catfish without hush puppies?

Service was like the food - just ok.  And someone said the place was tired.  Yep, my take as well.  But 8 glasses of wine out of a bottle?  And not cheap wine either."}
{"text":"The food is amazingggg. Absolutely delicious. But I don't really get the tacky decor/expensive menu combo. I wish it looked more upscale to match the menu."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Pappadeux.  Only my second time here and both were on Fridays to connect with friends. Both times we had EXCELLENT service with fantastic and attentive wait staff. I don't mind paying a bit more when I get quality food with great service. We enjoyed music on the patio with a pretty cool local singer/songwriter.  The vibe of Pappadeux is unique with families, couples, and large groups all appearing to have a good time.  I had grilled shrimp with sautéed green beans and my. oh. my... was my mouth was happy! 

Last note:  I never have dessert. The dessert tray was toO unique to give it a pass. The King cake cheesecake was to die for.  you should order that!"}
{"text":"Wonderful outdoor seating. Service here was great and I was so thrilled to see I could find them in Arizona. I can't come here without ordering the dip and a swamp thing. One of my favorite dishes is the Texas Redfish Pontchartrain but I honestly don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. I wish there were more locations on the east coast where I'm from."}
{"text":"We don't live nearby, so it's been a while.  But we happened to be nearby and so came in again.

I don't recall it being so loud last time.  It was VERY loud.  I mean really LOUD.  Not sure why.  The place was full, but I don't see why everyone was shouting.  Weird.

Various dishes were ordered.  I was hoping for a Cajun catfish.  Breaded and deep-fried.  Sounded good.  Well, it was a disappointment.  It may as well have been Long John Sliver's.  There was no seasoning.  The waitress was nice enough to bring me some Cajun seasoning which I sprinkled on the fish.  It helped, but I think it would have been better if it was part of the coating instead of adding it later.

The other dishes ordered were better (I got to sample them).  So it's clear I just ordered the wrong thing.  However, I think it fair to deduct points for this.  Everything should be flavorful and exciting.  And the fried catfish just wasn't.  It's not a question of not liking something.  The catfish was cooked properly and tasted like catfish.  But there were no exciting flavors unlike the other dishes they offer.  Why did they do that?  I expect more than Long John Silver's.

I also got a bowl of gumbo.  It wasn't quite as good as I remember from last time.  it had a slight burned flavor to it.  Like maybe they cooked the roux too long.  But it was otherwise flavorful.

I'm still a fan based on the other dishes I sampled (and wished I had ordered).  I just won't order the catfish ever again.

I also had the key lime pie.  It was a bit too sweet.  I've never had such a sweet key lime pie before. The tart tang was there, but overpowered by the sweet.  Strange.  Maybe they assumed the raspberry sauce they drizzled on the plate would help counter the sweetness?  Don't know.  I didn't use the drizzle because I just wanted key lime.  Usually whipped cream is there to counter the tartness (and there was some).  But the pie was too sweet already.  I gotta deduct a few points for that too.

So I'll take one star away.  I can't really justify taking two from them.  I definitely expect better than what I got.  It's one thing not to like something, it's another when something you like isn't executed as well as it should have been."}
{"text":"Was treated to an amazing surprise luncheon here recently with some fabulous friends and what a culinary experience. Fried alligator tail, oysters in the half shell and we also tried some lobster and a Cajun dish that was so amazing. Topped off by a desert that took my breath away!! Off to the gym now!! I can not wait to return!!"}
{"text":"My first time at Pappadeaux. I LOVED the architecture, ambiance and landscaping. Very beautiful.  My review is a 3.5 stars.  This place is very pricey $113 for two.

HIGHLY recommended:  
* Cedar plank salmon with asparagus.
* Banana bread pudding in a mason jar! You can get this to go too! INCREDIBLE!!
* The pasta that comes with the NOT recommended alaskan king crab legs was yummy. Just get the pasta ala carte.

NOT recommended:
* (2) Alaskan king crab legs with pasta. Very pricey and my friend and I were greeted and relayed that their seafood is fresh and flown in. I ordered this item and it was definitely NOT fresh. The crab legs were extremely salty, inedible. The texture was super off. 
* Creme brulee - was extremely bland, without flavor and the consistency was very loose, soup -like. Interesting enough I inquired about this to the hostess and she says that's how they make it. I just left it alone.
* Mojito (1)

I'll definitely return for other items to try. Yet, I recommend asking what is fresh before you order it. My oder was very disappointing and ironically enough the \"NOT recommended\" portion was mine. Boo.  Good news my friend shared and treated."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first night trying Pappadeaux and I couldn't have been happier! Our server Ryan Martinez was probably the best server we've ever had. He was very attentive and made us feel so welcome, as if we were part of the Pappadeaux family ourselves. The fresh Mahi-mahi was to die for and the lobster was exquisite. Desert presentation was so amazing that we had to take home a brownie for later. Thanks for the great night out!"}
{"text":"My in-laws wanted to take me somewhere for my birthday, and Pappa's always used to be one of my favorites so for dinner, this is where we decided to go. Even though many chain restaurants have come and gone in the era, this restaurant has remained a staple along the I-17 freeway. It's always tricky to get to especially when heading south on the I-17 since you have to go one exit past the restaurant, make a U-turn, and drive on the access road, but it's always crowded no matter what, even on a Thursday evening. 

The oysters were really good. They were fresh and regular in size. 

The Grand Hennessy drink was an especially tasty treat! Almost dessert like from the start! It featured the Hennessy VS Marnier with fresh lemon and orange juices with a \"splash of Moscato D'Asti.\" It's also very refreshing too - something I'd really enjoy during the summer.

I usually order more traditional fare like catfish with dirty rice or similar, but this time I ordered the biggest photo right smack on in the middle of their menu, The Lobster Boil. It somewhat reminded me of what you'd find at Joe's Crab Shack, but definitely much higher quality and less salty. I felt like everything was deliciously bathed in butter and light spices. 

The service was less than to be desired. It seemed like the restaurant was understaffed that night. From the get go, they sat our group of four instead of the couple that arrived there before us, so they brought only two menus, so as the hostess sat us, she only gave us two menus and took away the other 2 place settings. No problemo. I simply asked for her to keep those extra settings there and bring us two more menus. But then, our waiter would disappear for long periods of time, and forgot to bring my father in law a 2nd drink as requested, so the less than stellar performance kind of left us disappointed even though the food was good. It's not a deal breaker or anything, but that cheerful memory of this place is definitely jaded a bit now."}
{"text":"Fried everything is the best explanation of their menu. I went here to celebrate my fifth wedding anniversary and left feeling about twenty pounds heavier. I'm not into fried foods so maybe this place just isn't for me. I couldn't believe how busy it was considering. The prices are very high. The employees are very friendly. But I have zero desire to return."}
{"text":"Get here early or late, othrerwise a 630pm arrivals nets an hour and 45 minute wait. But it is worth it!

My husband and I used to visit Pappadeaux every Friday for the past year or two, until we recently moved to CA and I almost didn't want to move because there is no Pappas in the East Bay area of San Francisco/Oakland CA. BUMMER!!!! 

I highly recommend the soft shell crab, the mixed grill skewers, Salmon Yvette, and the andouille grits! We usually sit at the bar and have Nate, Susan, Rich, or Le Andrew serving us. Great atmosphere, great food, great service. 

WE MISS YOU PAPPADEAUX! We will make sure we visit whenever we are visiting Phoenix, AZ again."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to have a bite as we waited for traffic to subside. I got the salmon, octopus, and shrimp plate. It was good and hit the spot! I think if you're in this area, it's an obvious choice."}
{"text":"So I have been here twice in as many months, my gf dad, loves this place...I think it is OK. I liken it to an overpriced red lobster.

The service is ok. And this place is always busy, so you can expect a few hiccups with service being slow, or your waiter forgetting something simple like bread or silverware or water.

They are trained well, but I think are often overwhelmed, often times you have to ask someone to come remove plates to make room for new stuff, once again if they were not so busy or had a few dedicated bussers, I don't think this would be an issue. But alas it is. 

Food, the food is just OK, I know people that rave over it, I just don find it that appealing, I am a huge fan of gumbo, so the last time I was here, I ordered the shrimp gumbo, only to end up almost cracking my tooth on a piece of bone from god knows what was in my gumbo. It might have even been a piece of the bowl as far as I know...

This last time similar experience got the rainbow trout and shrimp, Loaded with butter almost drowned it, and bones thru out...does not make for a good dining experience. This place is ok, but for the prices I would expect more attention to be placed to small details. Will go here if invited but have experienced better seafood places throughout the valley. And if I had to choose I would go there instead."}
{"text":"Fast service, fastest i have seen!! Also very nice servers!!! I reallllly love their foods here oh and their bread omg!!! Honey plus bread=ftw"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Pappadeux. Servers are usually competent, food is quite good and the prices aren't outrageous."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Portion and service was great. We definitely will come again the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Service by Ryan was good. Enjoy appetizers Oysters main course Shrimp Etouffee, coconut Shrimp, Atlantic Salmon Yvette."}
{"text":"I went here with a good friend.  My friend got food poisoning from the 'grilled red fish and jumbo shrimp'.  She said it tasted gross and that she couldn't eat it.  I decided to take it home not wanting to waste food.  After trying it at home, I threw it away because it didn't taste right.

I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and that was very good.  The lobster bisque did not taste fresh.  It tasted old but the lobster pieces inside the bisque did taste very fresh.

I didn't feel well for the next 2 days after eating here.  I didn't feel better until I started taking a 'parasite cleanse'.

You would think a bill and tip for 2 that came out to be $139 would be a better experience.

Service was good this time.  Last time service was annoying.  We had a waitress that kept on insulting me the entire time and thought that was funny.  We both thought she was weird.

I went here 4 months before and the dishes were hit and miss.  The the fried calamari was stale tasting and tasted like a quick defrost of frozen food left too long in the freezer.  The Texas Redfish Pontchartrain was excellent.  One of the best tasting fishes in the Phoenix area.  

The 2 star is really for the hit and miss on certain items and for food poisoning.  This is a shame because this was one of my favorite restaurant chain when I lived in Houston 20 years ago."}
{"text":"Great service from hostess, bartenders and wait staff.  We were very disappointed in the quality of food for the price. Fish was not hot or crispy as expected from the fried mixed platter. Fries were not hot either. Not worth trying again at their prices."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with our lunch today. Very delicious. I had my doubts, but when the seafood grill came to our table every piece of fish was fresh light elegantly cooked to perfection. We are from San Francisco the land of excellent seafood. This is a top notch seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Great date night spot or get together with friends place!

Food is good, not cheap but not overpriced...

Cool spot and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Food was great, service was even better- we had a wonderful time at this restaurant when friends were in town and will definitely be going back!  Must try the desserts as well- delicious!"}
{"text":"Loved this place - great atmosphere, food was delicious! However they did screw up my order and sent the wrong platter to the table which I didn't even realize until the next day because i was too full to realize there was chicken on the platter. Oh well. Husband was in love with the king crab legs...calamari was great...flavoring on the fish was delicious too."}
{"text":"Love the seafood fondue. Shit is straight up amazing. 
I only take advantage of happy hours here. Service is poor but what do you expect from servers who never get tipped by the lower class. 
Great atmosphere, kick ass patio during the winter months and pricey."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, excellent wait staff very attentive. Food was hot and comes in large portions. My salad was made at the table very fresh, oysters were delicious. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"So very friendly stuff 
The food was amazing 
It's my first time at this restaurant and definitely I will come back 
Everything is so perfect"}
{"text":"My wife and I are both big lovers of seafood and we're very excited about going to Papaduex to eat. Our first visit was great, we both loved to food and our service was excellent but our next visit was just horrible!  My sister wanted to celebrate her Birthday there and made reservations for a party of 13, friends and family on Saturday 10th of February. Management asked that the entire party be there by 7:45 pm in which we all were. At 7:45 we were informed that the party before us had not left the area reserved for us and that we would have to wait till 8pm. We all waited patiently and stood chatting because of the crowd there. At 8pm they informed us that a couple of people were still sitting in the area we reserved and instead of asking them to leave or go to another area the forced us to wait a entire hour! My sister got emotionally upset because a couple of friends and family members got tired of waiting and left. It was the worst example of management I've seen anywhere and totally unprofessional. We were all starving and forced to wait on other people when she had tables reservations for us. They tried to make things a little better by offering free entrées but my sister was so upset because they had ruined her special moment and Birthday with everyone she invited. Some of us drove 45 minutes to an hour just to be there. The food wasn't satisfactory for some of us, maybe because expectations were ruined from wrongfully having to wait when we shouldn't have. All in all it was the worst moment at a restaurant me and my family and friends have ever had, one star would be too much. I don't know if we will ever give our buisness to them again."}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere. You can't go wrong. If there is a long wait love to set at the bar. It does get a little noise but it fits ."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the banana pudding.   The coconut shrimp was awesome.  My favorite entrée was the lobster bisque which I ate the next day.     Most importantly the service was immaculate. Julie was an excellent server; she answered all of my questions concerning the menu and kept the drink refills on tap.   On the other hand, the seafood gumbo's roux needs a little work.  Very thin and void of flavor.   Five star nonetheless."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Only draw back is the dining area is huge and loud so it makes it very difficult to have conversation."}
{"text":"Terrific happy hour, amiable staff. New Clam chowder is scrumptious. A great place for an ice cold on beer and some calamari."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times but tonight was the best.  We ordered a dozen Gulf Coast Oysters for two.  They were enormous and as fresh as could be.  I ordered the scallops and lump crab.   The scallops were perfectly grilled with a touch of natural sweetness. My friend had grilled bacon wrapped shrimp.  It was scrumptious!  4 beers later our bill was barely $100.   Well worth the night out.  Bartenders Danny and Nick were awesome.!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Whenever I'm in Phoenix for work, I make sure I stop by. The service is wonderful and the food is pretty damn good. I love the soft shell crabs with a load mashed potato. I've also tried the Alaskan King Crab, Lobster, and Salmon and Pappadeaux never dissapoints. They sometimes have specials for a half dozen oysters for only $5. 

I'm from Los Angeles and I wished they tore down all the Red Lobsters and Joe's Crab Shacks and opened a couple of these restaurants closer to home."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. If you think the rich are better than you are go here. You'll realize otherwise. God rich folks are nasty unethical behavior and flat out childlike. Back to the review lol, the waiters and waitresses are classy and excellent and so is the food and restaurant. Just had to throw in the rich nose blowing crouching out loud non manner rich snob rant in here. Because I can."}
{"text":"A little pricey and not the best in taste. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing (bacon wrapped shrimp)."}
{"text":"If you want to spend for a night out to dinner, don't even think past Pappadeaux. From great drinks to their perfectly prepared and presented lobster from the tank - you are in the one place in Phoenix where anything you order is going to be fantastic. And seafood in the desert?  However they manage it, it's fresh. And the taste is everything from a delicate rice to the boldest spiced gumbo. Go and sit at the bar and share their crab dip. The bartenders make eating at the bar easy and fun."}
{"text":"What a joke
Got a carry out shrimp and grits and Greek salad was the worst POS I ever ate. I called them right after paying $75 dollars for it. Talked to the manager and they said they would take care of me 3 weeks later gat a $50 gift card which as far as I am concerned can shove up ther ass. I have been going there since they opened. Never again f them"}
{"text":"For someone who's lived near New Orleans, this place was mediocre at best. I'm still craving Cajun/Creole cuisine in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Dined at Pappa's last night and it was nothing short a great. I love coming to Pappadeaux because you will almost never be disappointed. We ordered their Alligator and our server Tammy informed us we could do half of our order fried and the other half blackened. I love gator and hearing the option to do half n half was music to my ears. The versions of gator were great but the blackened gator was magnificent. The Mardi Gras pasta and the stuff shrimp were absolutely delightful. Tammy was an awesome server. She was probably the best server I've ever had in my life. If you have never dined at Pappadeaux before, my first question is what is wrong with you? My second question is why not? My third question is when are you planning on dining their because it's a wonderful restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is so messed up.  I've been maybe 10 times now, and it is so hit and miss. I keep coming back because I love the king crab legs and the lobster tail; haven't found another place that has them along with a decent array of other food in a lively atmosphere, but they don't inspire me with confidence considering I always spend over $100. My partners always end up with poor meals. 

First of all, their seating management is a disaster. On Friday's visit, I first called for a reservation - 9:30pm was the earliest offer.  I drove there anyway, arrived at 7:30pm, put in our name for a table for two, outside (new system in place - no more numbers, but vibrating alert gizmos).  I asked for outside, but she said 'let us know that when you are called' - probably the problem right there. We were told '20-30 minutes'.  No problem, we went to the smaller bar next to the outdoor dining patio and had a beer.  The Patio was 30% full only, and the waiters servicing the outdoor patio were standing around idle. After watching the patio remain largely empty for at least 20 minutes, I approached the front desk and asked, 'how come we aren't being seated since the patio is not full?\" She immediately grabbed a couple of menus and seated us.  We later asked our waiter what was going on, he said ...'million dollar business with a couple of high-school kids running the front desk'.  Just about sums it up! 

We also got dripped on and generally over-chilled by the misters and fans. We finally asked for them to be turned off, but it took a good 20 mins for the misters to completely 'dry out' (one of the reasons I want to sit outside is to avoid the over-chilled interior). 

I had the lobster tail, it was great. My partner had the 'hudson bay combo' ... the bacon-wrapped shrimp were great, but the lobster tail and the scallop were totally lukewarm, tasting like they were cooked well in advance.  Not good for a $27 entree."}
{"text":"Seafood are soooo fresh specially the oysters. I'm a seafood lover & it's my 1st time eating in Pappadeaux & I'm definitely gonna come back. Service is great as well."}
{"text":"Out of Flounder and no halibut tonight. Mushroom risotto very salty and too mushroomy. Very pricey. Everything else ok"}
{"text":"The shrimp was overcook d and WAYYYY over season... That's that...  We did came in light but why serve us food then if it's going to be all bad.  My friends fried food was dry as hell, they didn't have any more pasta for the Mac and cheese so they used linguini noodles.. with watered down cheese sauce.  I got to admit worse late night dining ever."}
{"text":"Always great food and service.  It's always busy and boisterous, not the place to come if you're looking for a quiet evening..."}
{"text":"Scallops are fantastic, cocktail shrimp is perfect, the squash risotto is one of my faves!"}
{"text":"Went with Patrick to celebrate 3 years together. After hearing great things I came in with a really high expectation. They met every single one. Not only that but when they did mess up and gave me mushroom risotto before I even realized the fact that it was not what I ordered (no joke was on the table maybe 2 minutes) they had the risotto replacement on the table! APOLOGIZED AND!! YES AND!! Offered to re-plate it!... this wasn't the waitress apologizing... IT WAS THE CHEF! Talk about making me feel really important. The scallops were amazing the herb risotto was amazing and even the desert (which was given to us on the house for coming there to celebrate) of creme brule blow my mind. I had a food high and floated like a overfilled happy balloon all the way home."}
{"text":"Had some gator, pretty cool. Long wait to sit and the place is so busy that any messes are swept or kicked under the table. For my wife and I to eat, it cost $120 including tip.
Cheesecake was awesome."}
{"text":"The Wife and I visited this Pappadeaux  this evening...and i must say i thought the one in Illinois was great, but this one was even greater. It is the only location in the entire state of Arizona...and it is very spacious with plenty of outdoor seating with cool zone fans. They were having a special on Crawfish which my wife had and i had to show her how to eat them...but she really enjoyed them. I had my usual blackened Halibut with the yvette sauce, and dirty rice and it was simply delicious as usual with other locations i have been to.

The happy hour there is top notch as well, we will probably try that next time...but this place while always packed is so very relaxing and the service is spectacular. If it is not on the menu and you want something in particular they probably will have it there, and they will be more than happy to prepare it for you. It is a little expensive to eat here because it is quality seafood...made to order...but it is well worth it. So the next time you want some great cajun and seafood delights make a trip to this establishment off the I-17 South here in phoenix and you will leave happy. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Very, very good seafood just about everything on there menu is great ask for Johnnie for your waiter he is excellent he is on point with the menu he explains everything you need to know very nice gentlemen"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Can't go wrong with some down south food. This is the best place in the valley to eat. If you sit at the bar you get super fast service."}
{"text":"Favorite seafood around. Great steaks and drinks as well. Fried gator isnt too shabby either. Wait can be long but worth it. They do take reservations as well."}
{"text":"Just left after having dinner and this time just was not a pleasant experience.
We started with an hour wait (no problem at all we sat and had drinks)
At the bar we had frog legs mmm they were good.
Our buzzer went off and we got seated.
First they never gave us silverware I had to get up and ask for it (no problem they were busy)
Our waiter seemed pre-occupied and made us feel like unwanted guest.

We sat with our drinks empty most of the dinner our appetizers came late and our food came cold.
I had Costa Rican Mahi it was very good although cold the grits and sauce were amazing.
My husband had bacon wrapped shrimp he asked for a baked potato side was quoted a $3.95 price (I may be wrong on the change) and when the bill came it was almost $6.00 for a baked potato that also came way after the food came out.
We went with friends they had the seafood platter and chicken linguini.
Meal is over we are thirsty as our glasses weren't refilled.
Our friends food gets taken to the back to be boxed only one meal got boxed and when we asked about the other he went to the back and came back with a piece of fish in a box. When we asked where the rest of the meal went he said it got dumped. Well wait that makes no sense as I have a piece of fish right here how do you dump fries but save the fish that was on top of the fries?
Needless to say they won't be eating the fish! 
He did give 2 free deserts to make up for the food that got thrown.
Key lime pie was very good as was the chocolate brownie.

Of course we will return we enjoy this place.
Hopefully next time it will be better :)"}
{"text":"Get the shrimp and grits.. it is the best I have ever tasted.. We also had lobster bisque which has huge chunks of lobster in it.. It is a bit pricey but huge portions and worth every penny.. I have also had the tilapia there and it was wonderful.. Service is right on very good.."}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal. I like to sit at the bar, as I feel that it gives the best view of the rest of the restaurant, for people watching.  From the attentive and knowledgeable staff, to the expert chefs that prepare the delectable dishes, dinner was delicious and perfect. 
 
I started with the oysters,  which were large and perfectly prepared. I highly recommend them.

I ordered a fresh seafood item, the scallops with sweet pea risotto.  Absolutely Devine! 

Since I am celebrating my birthday month, I also enjoyed a dessert.  The mixed dessert of  pecan  and sweet potato pie, creme brulee 
, and banana pudding was the perfect ending.

You can sign up online for your complementary birthday dessert. I hope that your visit is as delicious as mine was."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I waited years to go here, heard great things. The restaurant was too packed. Very loud. Had to shout to have a conversation. Food wasn't great. After spending $110 the kids meal was the best thing"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight and absolutely loved it.  I had raw oysters, boiled shrimp, salad, and prime rib with asparagus.  Everything was superb and perfectly timed. 

A young man named Steven waited on our table and took excellent care of us.  


The one complaint I have is that there was no hot water in the men's rest room.  I hope that the restaurant is not trying to cut costs, especially considering the many menu items that require eating by hand."}
{"text":"The shrimp creole and grits, jumbo lump crab cake, shrimp and scallop orecchiette pasta and the creme brule were all outstanding. 

The fried frogs legs was pretty good also considering I'm not a frog legs connoisseur.

Great food ...friday nite was close to an hour wait but worth it."}
{"text":"@ 6 pm on a Monday evening there was a fifteen minute wait. Seated and no server but Nick stopped and took our drink order and said he didn't know who had table. While Nick was getting drinks ( Beer and waters) another waiter put waters down probably seeing we hadn't been waited on. Nick went and took our table and I ordered a dinner salad with bleu cheese dressing ($4.75) and the chef specialty - 
SHRIMP & SCALLOP ORECCHIETTE PASTAshrimp & scallops over orecchiette pasta with jumbo lump crab & asparagus in a creamy parmesan vodka sauce 29.95. The salad needed more dressing but was good. The pasta was VERY good with the three large scallops exceptional and three shrimp tasty. Just the right amount of food!"}
{"text":"We came came for a schmoozing from a corporate client. It worked. 

We had the Mediterranean Calamari for apps. They were really good, I like the deep fried artichoke. 

I had lobster bisque, it was really creamy and had great flavor. 

The lunch was a halibut fillet sandwich and dirty rice. The rice was perfectly seasoned and fluffy. The halibut was cooked perfectly and was a very nice size. It was flaky and not dry at all. 

The building was really neat, I think a nice outside happy hour would be great in mid to late October. 

The service was perfect, not over pretentious or up on you the whole time."}
{"text":"I HATE SEAFOOD!!! I was dragged to this place but I do want to say that the chicken pasta I had was very delicious. Their drinks were amazing.... ( I HATE TEA!!!)  But their sweet southern tea OMG so freaking good!!! I want to go back just to order their drinks!!!!! They were very busy so we were forced to sit outside on the patio which as first I was groaning about since it was 99 degrees, however how they have the fans and mist it was very nice and cool.... I had a great experience the waitress came by often was very sweet and chatty and even helped me find items that were non seafood for me to order. Even with the amount of people in the restaurant at that time they came back often and refilled our drinks/ asked if we needed anything often and it was very appreciated."}
{"text":"First great service! Our waitress filled our teas and was just wonderful.  Even brought us a to go ice tea. The appetizer was the fried calamari.  I would call it a 3.5 it was tough and chewy and greasy. I ordered the Chicken Pasta dish and I give it a 5/5. Big portion great flavors. My husband had the Cajun Combo. He loved the catfish but the shrimp portion had a huge pile of white rice with tomatoes and then 5 little shrimp. Still a great value and well done. I recommend sitting in the back as its a noisy place but great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've eaten in pappadeaux in Chicago as well as Texas and the food and the atmosphere was amazing. Here in phoenix the food was not worth the bill. After the server forgot to bring me the right drink three times I received my meal. I ordered the Alligator tail and it was extremely salty and taste horrible compared to the restaurant in  Schaumburg IL. My fiancée fish was burned on the other side and was tried to be hidden with vegetables.  One the good side they comped us the 1 drink and still brought me a bill for $120.00 and yes they no longer have swordfish. waste of a drive. Pappadeaux is a great restaurant, just not in Arizona."}
{"text":"So I came to Phoenix to visit my family and work. Just so happen to drive by this Texas gem in the middle of the desert. So you know my friends and I had to stop inside. We get there and put it names on the list. Was expecting to wait 30 min...boom 15 min. Got seated fast and I order the voodoo drink. Filet mignon with the lobster. Side of asparagus and grits. I love this place and I love it more now that is on the west coast. I want one in California. Just love the Southern hospitality! The servers are always well groomed. The good is always perfect. It's worth every penny."}
{"text":"This was a delicious experience.  The atmosphere is fantastic and so is the food and finally the customer service.  

The first items I ordered:  fried alligator 5/5(the sauce was spicy, creamy, and almost gravy like).  The next was the spinach dip with the bombest bread ever 5/5!

For the main course I had to try the Andouille, Crab, and Shrimp Gumbo!  Delicious people!  It took me down south with every bite!  It was an explosion of flavor that I truly enjoyed.  Also, the Shrimp Po Boys were fantastic!  Finally I ordered the Fried Catfish with almost a beignet covered in spicy gravy!  Yum!  Also the sides were great I highly recommend the Cheesy Grits with Andouille.  Bring your friends, bring hour family, and definitely bring your fat pants!  Pappadeaux oh how I've fallen in love with thee!  Cheers !!"}
{"text":"This is a good date night place. Their food is on the expensive side but it's seafood and they do not skimp on the seafood. Free bread and butter and Ordered the oyster duo, crawfish etouffee with dirty rice and a cup of gumbo. All delicious. Did i mention they dont skimp on seafood? Yea, they don't. The oyster duo is a combination the baton rouge and the oyster pappadeux. I preferred the oyster baton rouge. It's cheesy. Crawfish etouffee just reminded me of New Orleans. overall good experience. The waiters were very attentive and fast."}
{"text":"Have gone here for years and always enjoyed the food. Unfortunately tonight was not going to happen as someone at the restaurant decided to park not only a storage container blocking off parking spots in the back lot, but THEN an entire flipping SEMI-TRUCK with trailer that blocked off a good 8-9 parking spots. 

No way to find a place to park, customers were driving in the parking lot, looking then leaving. Sad to say I was one of those. The food is IMHO great but if you cannot get a place to park you cannot eat. I may be back but not sure when...."}
{"text":"Love this place so much we have spent Christmas Eve here the last 15 years.  One of our favorite places to go.  Visited last Friday and the service just seemed overwhelmed.  Only writing this hoping it was a glitch and whoever reads this takes a look at the operations.  Timing was off (slow) and a very big no no on a pet peeve of mine - Please don't serve cold beer in hot glasses right out of the dishwasher.   Bartender fixed rounds 2 and 3 after we mentioned it but it should be obvious from the get go.  We did enjoy the music on the patio.  Whoever the singer was, was very good."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good service and awesome food, Lobster tails are HUGE and always seems to be fresh. I love going there for the seafood, it's a nice treat. The wait staff always seem to be helpful and the service is good. They can also handle large groups looks like to me."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.

I have tried so many different items from the menu and they all taste so good.

The Chilean sea bass is so amazing.

Tonight I had the Moroccan Salmon and Shrimp with crab couscous. It was cooked perfectly and so flavorful.

The cocktails are so tasty and you can taste alcohol

Love this place"}
{"text":"Service = 6 stars!  You rock!

The food itself is very delicious (I think it's a little too salty for my taste), and really where it shines is the amazing service, both in terms of helpfulness and friendliness."}
{"text":"Okay is a good summation of Pappadeaux. The food is good. Sometimes very good. But certainly not inexpensive, so for the price is SHOULD be good - arguably even better. A reasonable portion (about 6 ounces) of gator, for example, as an app is about $20. 3.5 ounces (medium vs. large) is $15. Is it good? Heck yeah, though with many of the smaller pieces, the gator taste is concealed by the fried batter flavor. But there's no value there.

The entrees are also quite pricey and again good, but not great. In my opinion, not good enough to warrant the prices. To be clear, when you set prices at a premium level the expectation is set deliver a premium meal. Good isn't good enough.

With all that though, both our orders were wrong and after waiting 45 minutes to get in and another 45 to get our entrees we took what we got. The bill adjustments were minimal and did little to reduce the grand total.

Would we come back? Perhaps if it was a special occasion and we wanted their food items specifically. But we eat out OFTEN and would not return for casual or even somewhat fancier dining."}
{"text":"hubby & I both gluten free & when asked for the menu the server gave us a 1-page nothing. She said they only serve what's on that menu for GF patrons. I asked about chilean sea bass which was not on the GF menu but based on how it was made it sounded GF already, server said she'd check w/the cook. Came back & said yes, only the cheese sauce would have to be omitted so I ordered it. It came on a bed of broccolini which was overcooked, tough & tasteless. Fish had nothing on it & was also extremely tasteless. Husband ordered scallops & they were bland as well. Price is way too much for what you get. First & last visit."}
{"text":"Blackened Shrimp & Crawfish Fondeaux... what more do I need to say.  This was the first thing I tried at Pappadeaux's and I have ordered it every time since.  From the fried seafood menu, the Pappadeaux Platter is great and there is enough food for 2 if you get an appetizer to start, unless you are real hungry."}
{"text":"Recommendations: 
1) fried alligator--you have to try it at least once in your life
2) gulf coast oysters--shucked right at the bar
3) cajun bloody mary
4) stuffed shrimp montage

Pass:
1) cheesecake --it wasn't bad; but it is probably better to try one of the other unique desserts like the praline bread or banana wafer puddings
2) cedar plank salmon--my friend's salmon came out mostly raw, even when reheated

This place was pretty frickin' sweet. I haven't enjoyed a dining experience quite like this one in a long time. I savored our meal and had a great time. Our server Rich went above and beyond to make sure things went right."}
{"text":"Patio dining has great atmosphere with the fountains and lights; it's also the only place where you can converse with your table mates as the inside dining room is extremely noisy. Unfortunately our food and service were lacking. Ordered the Sea Bass and grilled shrimp; sea bass very nice, shrimp over cooked and rubbery. Table mate had the shrimp and orecchiette with vodka sauce- pasta over cooked, shrimp rubbery, vodka sauce very nice. Asked three times for tableware, water brought one glass at a time, couldn't find a spoon for my coffee, drink refills had to be requested.  For the prices here I expect better service and food properly prepared. In the past both the food and service were great; last nite, not so much."}
{"text":"The salads here are absolutely ah-mazing!  My fav is the chopped salad with crawfish....delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was very delicious. However, the service was very very slowwww. We sat close to 10 minutes without being acknowledged by our waiter. Finally took our drink order and then took close to another 15 minutes to deliver our iced teas and take our entree order. Checked on us once late in the meal. Which is unfortunate because we did need a few times after our entrees were delivered but were never offered additional service. Empty tables all around us. During our meal a family of 5 was seated next to us. I heard the father say \"I can't believe we waited 20 minutes to be seated here when it was open the whole time. Maybe if you 4 hostess girls didn't gather around the podium and chat we would have been seated quicker.\" This gives you an idea that several customers were unhappy by the service provided by the restaurant employees. The food is delicious. The prices are high. The service is poor. Now it's you that has to decide if it's worth experiencing. As for my husband, mother-in-law, and I....probably won't return."}
{"text":"We went there in a short road trip, we had a two hr wait, but a nice waitress told us we could wait at the bar, we found a very large lounge area, we cancelled the wait and had dinner at the bar area, it was awesome,  if you are ever in Phoenix with a loved one, or just a weekend trip, this is a treat!! Very nice!!"}
{"text":"What a night! So I decided to treat myself to some lovely mudbugs aka crawfish during the annual crawfish boil that happens every March to April here at Pappadeaux's. I got in just in time to get a seat at the bar and get situated. The fantabulous Susan, Sarah and Colin took GREAT care of me all night. From Susan nudging me to get the bigger glass of beer (good call and it was an easy nudge) to all three of them checking in on me as I was devouring the 2.5 lbs of crawfish I had ordered. #teamgreedy in full effect!

So between the fabulous bar staff and me meeting some new bar patrons, it was a great night. I chatted it up with about everyone and we even had some skinamax stuff going on at the end of the bar. Funny indeed. Oh and to top off my night, my entire dinner tab was paid for by the nice gentleman I had chatted it up with most of the evening. How very sweet and overly generous was that? ( No,no love connection or anything just a kind gesture with NO expectations!) Wow, talking about being blessed. 

I only have about two more weeks before the crawfish boil ends. So needless to say I will be back again the next two Thursdays to get my fix."}
{"text":"If you want real seafood Cajun style this is your place. Their food is to die for!  I had the most succulent fish. The salad was crisp and tasty. All good seasoned well. Glasses were quickly refilled even during the presentation. I have been here several times and will certainly go again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant.  I have been here three times and love coming here. It's a bit expensive for a dish but you get a lot of food for the price. I have gotten the oysters, mussels, fried samplers platter,and a couple of the fresh fish options. I also usually get a cup of gumbo with my meals.  The place is usually packed on the weekend but they have a bar and some tvs for the wait.  The services here is always really good as well. I have nothing to complain about this place. Definitely will keep coming back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place out for a while but never did because it's a bit of a drive from the East Valley. But, I had the opportunity to dine here tonight with my boyfriend for a nice dinner out. Since it's a Friday night, we did have to wait but decided a nice drink at the bar would be a good idea. The bar is pretty big and the bartenders are very friendly. Full service bar too so if you don't want to wait, that's an option. The couple we sat next to are regulars of the restaurant and raved about the food before we even sat down to eat. The restaurant itself is very vibrant and nice. The decor is a little outdated but still comfortable. You can dress up or be casual.

When we got our table, we were greeted by a friendly waitress. We were immediately served bread and continued to have great service throughout the night. If our waitress didn't get to us, there were many other staff available to get drinks, napkins, bring out food, etc. When I asked to sample the gumbo, they were more than happy to bring out a sample. It tasted great with the bread! I decided to eat light and went with the mussles whereas my boyfriend ate the mahi alexander. He loved it! Big portions but also a big price tag. 

For good seafood, this place is amazing. They also have a nice outdoor patio and on a nice night, it's nice to sit out and eat. They also have a live band on the weekends too. Overall, this place is great and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We were in Glendale for a friend son's football game and it was lunchtime, so my husband asked me to check out Yelp for restaurants near us. 
I really love the iPhone app, I sorted my bookmarks and Pappadeux was the closest.

My husband ordered a chicken pasta dish (not in the mood for seafood), our friend a Cajun combo plate and for me the fried crawfish/etoufee.

Everyone enjoyed their food, our friends really liked the dirty rice. My dish was absolutely delicious, the etoufee sauce was smoky/spicy and very flavorful and I as well loved the dirty rice The fried crawfish was ok, nothing special. The loaf of bread before dinner was warm and crispy, very good. The kids menu didn't had much for my 17 mo/old son,most  everything was fried  (he doesn't  like fried food much...I know, he didn't got that from me;) but he filled up on bread and the crackers they had at the table. The waiter was very nice and prompt, although it took a while for our food to come out.

We have friends from New Orleans who are great cooks and they enjoyed the food here as well.

I'll definitely will come back for the dirty rice and crawfish etoufee."}
{"text":"Damn wish this place was closer to Gilbert. Best southern seafood I have ever had outside of Louisiana. Everything here is amazing . Crab cakes, alligator and Oysters are fresh and any fish you get you can't go wrong. Love this place and will be coming back as long as we are on that side of town,"}
{"text":"Great service food okay at best but the desert is phenomenal so between deserts and service was the savor for the fried tilapia but the shrimp and Caribbean lobster tail was great I think the person frying the fish may have been a little off this night"}
{"text":"I love seafood and love this place. I had clam chowder, catfish, fries, and my husband had catfish and a bake potato.  The food was great.  I cannot wait until my next visit.  The service was great.  Our waiter was great.  We will be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for canun seafood. Never ordered anything I didn't love.  Great atmosphere.  Stafd is always friendly.  Great place for date night anf anniversary dinners."}
{"text":"Delicious, really fresh seafood! They also care about their customers. I have an allergy to only one kind of seafood item and they always have a manager talk with me to make sure the dish I order will be safe and prepared to my satisfaction."}
{"text":"We travel to Phoenix sometimes and when we do our number one place to have dinner is Pappadeaux Seafood Restaurant. This place is absolutely amazing I wish they were here in San Diego. The lines are sometimes a little long but while you wait in line they have a nice waiting area and they offer you free appetizers while you wait and you could get a drink at the same time. Definitely a great dinner experience and customer care. The food is Cajun style and all freshly made. But do not hesitate to try the Crispy Fried Alligator as an appetizer, it is delicious (Not like you could imagine).  Steak & Lobster is the best anywhere! Great service and great food."}
{"text":"Loved the food,Although is kinda on the pricey side it's totally worth it. Customer service was also satisfying. We definitely loved the experience."}
{"text":"It is no New Orleans but the food was surprisingly decent for a chain restuarant.  The seafood was fresh and cooked well.  I had the halibut with the Diablo sauce.  They are great with mixing and matching sauces and fishes.  We also ordered a dozen raw oysters and oyster pappadeux.  There are hints of southern style cuisine such as dirty rice, crawfish sauce, and any seafood you like fried.  As for actual taste, I didn't get much southerness from the flavors.

The second time, we got the seabass and two of us got the all you can east lobster. The seabass was cooked well and the sauce was tasty. The lobsters came with dirty rice as the side and it was pretty good. The lobsters are a good decent size and good quality lobsters. I finished 5 of them and the other finished 9 of them. I think eating 3 would be good. i cant say it is necessarily a good deal because it is just eating too much lobster unnecessarily. The time in between each round of new lobster fluctuated a lot and the service was just decent."}
{"text":"They don't have one in Michigan so I was excited to stop here in Arizona.

The food way good but had just a bit too much seasoning. The lobster bisque was good, but not the best I've ever had. The spinach artichoke dip was good as well.

I'd like to come back just not sure when."}
{"text":"This is the best Cajun food I've ever eaten. Lisa the waitress was awesome. The shrimp Great atmosphere was good highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Went to Pappadeaux for an early Mardi Gras celebration. No redfish. No king cake or cheesecake. Bathrooms were disgusting. We sat at the bar and the servers seemed to not care that we were there. It took 30 minuets to get 6 oysters and by the time we were done we finally go some bread.  Our side dish came out several minutes after our entree. Someone needs to teach the kitchen and food runners to look at tickets to make sure an order is complete."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent, but never gets to really great.  The food is good, yet not always totally fresh.  Service is pretty good if they are slow, but sometimes the place is packed and you have to wait a long time for everything.  There aren't a lot of cajun options in this area, so I still come here every now and then.  I'd go somewhere else if that was an option."}
{"text":"This was my boyfriend and I'd first time coming here. We ordered a dozen cold gulf shucked oysters, fried alligator, shrimp creole and grits, and Atlantic salmon Alexander. The oysters were great, the shells were pretty dirty on the outside that my bf's napkin had so many black smudges on it but I mean you don't put the shell in your mouth so I didn't mind as much as he did. The fried alligator was so tasty and the sauce it came with was awesome and zingy! It also came with these shoestring like fried potato thingys. I ordered the shrimp creole and grits and a baked potato on the side. I have never had grits before but MAN, were those so good!!! And so was the shrimp creole, it had okra, green bell beepers, and I think tomato chunks. My bf ordered the Atlantic salmon Alexander with dirty rice and he said it was the best salmon he's ever had. It was topped with grilled shrimp and scallops and the flavors were perfection. Biggest baked potato I've ever had btw.  
For dessert we ordered the double turtle brownie topped with Haagen Daaz ice cream and Caramel sauce. Since it was our first time they comped the dessert which was so nice of them! 
Only reason I gave 4/5 stars was for less than perfect service time management. 
We got seated, 10 min later he came and asked what drinks we wanted and we ordered apps. 15 min later our waters came. Another 15-20 min our drinks and bread came out. Then another 15-20 min he came and took our orders. The food didn't take too long to come out but when we would look for him to order things it felt like he was no where to be found. We were there for 2 and a half hours and even though we weren't in a rush it felt like a long time. 
Benefit of the doubt, they are a big restaurant with an always packed Saturday night. So if you go on a Saturday night, just be prepared to enjoy some quality time with whoever you go with."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place the food is delicious and the service is amazing. Dustin was our server I took some friends there for the first time and he made the experience an unforgettable one! He was efficant and always made sure we were taken care of properly he made our experience a fun and fast visit."}
{"text":"We have been to Pappadeaux restaurants before, in other cities, and have always enjoyed the experience.  This location was no exception.  Friendly, attentive service.  Great selection of seafood dishes and Cajun style entrees.  Mixed drinks were flavorful.  A bit pricey, but portions are very generous -- we went home with leftovers. Nice desserts that we took home with us.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Always great seafood!! The Mahi and the Redfish are outstanding. Fresh and never fishy tasting. Can be a bit pricey with long wait times around dinner, otherwise would be a 5 star for me."}
{"text":"Went in over the weekend for an anniversary dinner. Prices are pretty high so it's good place for special occasions. It's very busy at all hours so be prepared to wait. The restaurant itself is beautiful. They have a gorgeous patio area with a waterfall and plenty of seating area to wait. I have been here a few times and service is always fantastic! Everyone is very friendly and prompt service.

We got the appetizer trio to include fried alligator, fried frog legs, and mozzarella. Everything was great. The alligator is a must have and the breading is so light and delicious. The mozzarella sticks were huge and tasty too. We also split the mussels in a sausage, lemon, garlic, wine sauce. Plenty of food and delicious. Mussels are huge! Save some bread to dip in the sauce. So good (:

Of course we ended with the creme brûlée which was perfect to share and very good. Overall everything was amazing and looking forward to coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"First visit to this location. Not the last. Probably not even the last this month. I have only been to one other Pappadeaux's...it was in an airport...and it was phenomenal (even though I only had 30 minutes to scarf down the food and drink)

I asked the waiter \"Sampler platter or seafood platter, pick one\" and he steered me to the seafood platter. Good choice! WAAaaaaaaAAAAyyyyy too much food, but nothing will go to waste. I'm set for lunch today AND dinner tonight. My fried food quota has been met.

Baked potato was tasty...but was quickly eclipsed by the tilapia...which was then put to shame by the stuffed crab (is it me or does it taste JUST LIKE my mom's stuffed crab? WOW! MY FAVORITE!!!) Next time I think I'll just look for a stuffed crab meal (after I check out the kitchen to make sure Mommy isn't being held captive for her culinary skills in there). 

I have a hard time ordering crawfish from anywhere that isn't in Louisiana, but I might be persuaded to order it from here because the guy at the table next to ours looked like he was in some sort of throes of passion as he buried his head in the plate and licked his fingers (pinch da tails and suck da heads indeed! Maybe they should make one of the rooms in the restaurant ADULTS ONLY?!) . KINKY!!! 

Mom in law had the mahi and grits and despite her tiny frame, she was having a hard time putting her fork down! The Hubster (wooooord up!) chose the fried crawfish meal and papa in law chose something that I can't remember w/ a cup of gumbo on the side and he barely uttered a word the entire meal. Shhhh....I'm eating. :) 

If we didn't have King Cake waiting at home, we would've been happy to dive into their scrumptious looking dessert tray too, but alas, sometimes we must show a little restraint, mustn't we?

Oh...and the bread and butter at the beginning of the dining event was deliciously fresh and soft too...I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Welp... This was a huge disappointment. First, the service was horrible. I asked for a refill for water. They said someone else was coming. After the third time, they refilled it. Once it was time to order, we were told we could not move spots. Not in a joking way, but more of a we will hate you if you do. My food came and it was cold. They brought out new food pretty fast so that was a plus. Also, Personal space was an issue. I must have been in the wrong seat. I was brushed up on and touched way too many times. At one point, I got up and moved to the other side of the table because i had no space of my own left between myself and the server.  I paid way too much for average food and really bad service. I will never come back here again. Totally not worth it."}
{"text":"We tried this place last night. We both ordered the seafood andouille gumbo. It's a very watery gumbo and there was bits of crab shell in my gumbo I had to pick out. We then went on to order side salads and then the picatta halibut. We received our meals after ordering in like 10 min. It was really fast but a little too fast. If it was fresh halibut I think it would take a little bit longer to cook. The halibut did not taste fresh and was really mushy and fishy tasting. We never received the salads. We also got the butternut squash which is streamed plain squash, no seasoning and it didn't taste like any butter either. I was really disappointed because I've heard such great things about this place."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have dinner at this place.  So many of my friends  have mentioned how the food was so amazing. If you know me I'm hard to please but  this place was amazing....

It feels like you have  timed-lapse back to New Orleans before Katrina. This place has a cottage look to it.... with seating all around and water sprinkler everywhere.  

As we walked in..... an adorable blond hair waitress smiled and asked me how many?  I said \"two\"......DID SHE SAY AN HOUR WAIT!!

I'M STARVING I don't have an hour to give. I asked the waitress can we sit at the bar she said \"Of course if you could find a seat\".... 

Aghhhhh.... this place is crowded but as I turned around two seats were available. I'm running now right towards the seats! 

Hooray.....

The menu was amazing every fried foods item that you can imagine.... I don't think I have ever seen so many ways to fry shrimp. LoL 

I ordered the fried lump crab cakes and my hubby ordered the gritts and shrimp!

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!

It was the best crab cake I ever had and the shrimp with gritts was amazing. I HATE gritts but this buttery cloud taste amazing. I think I'm crying.  

Let's not talk about the trio dessert..... OMG!!! Banana pudding, pecan pie and creme brul?....

Now we known for seafood this delicious in Phoenix isn't cheap. It's not super expensive but two meals, with no drinks (non alcohol) and one dessert ran us $90 without tip. So if you plan on getting an lobster bring a credit card. They start at $45.00 but to some people its worth it. I did!!!!! 

I'll be here again very soon..... I'm tearing again.... lol"}
{"text":"I had a really good customer experience here today. Came here for a business lunch and we got to enjoy it in the private wine room. I told the waitress that I have a shellfish allergy and she told me that \"they take allergies very serious\" and that  a manager would come out to speak with me. A few minutes later the manager came out and asked me about my shellfish allergy and then educated me on how they will prepare my dish to minimize the contact to shellfish and asked me if that was ok. It was more then ok, I have never had a restaurant go through this to make sure that I was ok with how they are going to prepare my food. Definitely a great customer experience and our waitress was fantastic! The food was great too!"}
{"text":"Top of the line! Went there to celebrate several birthdays in my family. The waitress was the cutest thing ever. She was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. She did make a mistake but quickly corrected it. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was pleasant."}
{"text":"Every year we are in Arizona my husband and I have to stop here for dinner.  He absolutely loves the fried alligator.  I love the fresh fish dishes.  The prices are a little bit high but well worth it for the quality of food you receive.  

On this past visit we had a great waiter.  He was very helpful and friendly.  He did the right amount of \"check ins\" on us without being overbearing."}
{"text":"So I'll confess... I'm from NOLA & my expectations are always high at Pappadeaux, but this location def missed the marked. 

I've been to most of the ATL locations as as Houston and it's always been \"good for a chain.\" But dropping into the Phoenix location for HH left much, if not everything, to be desired.

Drinks:
Chain seafood is one thing, but you can traditionally always expect good drinks at Pappadeaux. The bartenders at this place, however, were dismal at best. Ordered the Baton Sweet Tea and the Swamp Thing, and they were so weak that it felt like I had ordered them virgin. 

Food:
The Mini Fondeaux is typically a great appetizer and a highlight on their HH menu. In Phoenix, it was a barely palatable mix of cheese and mushrooms. If there was any seafood in it, they must have swam away before it was served. We didn't bother getting our usual entrees, the cheesy mushroom soup that out fondeaux resembled was just enough to hold us over until we could make it to a better restaurant.

Service:
Mediocre, but met the bare necessities.

Ambience:
More monotone and quiet than usual. TNF was on, but with the awkward TV placement, I'm sure no noticed or cared. 

If you're starving or have low expectations, give it a try if you must. I'd steer clear otherwise."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out.  Very Authentic cuisine and nice atmosphere!  I had the seafood gumbo and a salad..which was the perfect size for a lunch.  My friends were all happy with their meals and everyone had leftovers.  Our server Denny was very personable and attentive.  I appreciated how accommodating he was and that the restaurant lets you make substitutions with side dishes.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here for a mamas night out date night. We arrived around 630p on a Saturday. The atmosphere here is wonderful. The good: large menu selection, fresh fish, beautiful dining areas, polite waitstaff,  delicious desserts, decent wait time during peak hours. The bad: we were seated at a corner table in the main walkway directly outside the bussing station. Worst table in the house. We asked for another table as soon as we were sat there and the hostess told us we would have to go back on the wait list. We were re-sat in about 5 minutes. The next 2 couples they tried to sit at this table also asked for other seating. Our food took almost 45 minutes to come out. My scallops were overdone and the risotto was chewy and raw. It was very loud inside and hard to hear. Poor parking. All in all, if I could rate 3.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"We have been to several of their locations in Houston and Dallas and this one didn't disappoint. Our server, Audrey was wonderful. Her personality and professionalism made the dining experience perfect. 

The portions are large so go easy on the courses or plan to take lots home. My husband had the tilapia and I had a red fish. Both were amazing. I want the recipe for their spaghetti squash!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and when I came to Phoenix, had to make sure that I came here...what I get is usually the same...crawfish étouffée
 and I take a piece of key lime pie to go....what can I say, some habits I like!

The waitress was amazing and I am so sorry I didn't get her name...she took the time to just make sure our experience was a good one and the person I came with had never been there before!  Left a good impression on her...and it would have been nice to remember her name...to give her a shout out!  

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place it has never disappointed me!"}
{"text":"Wonderful oysters, amazing staff and lovely company.  Will be returning soon!  We sat at bar and table and both were romantic atmosphere.  Enjoyed the alligator and lobster also."}
{"text":"The wait was long (I rolled my eyes and apparently a 30-60 minute wait is \"good\" for this place) The management doesn't have the foresight to have a hostess selling drinks. Leaving money on the table and the customer unhappy!  
The food was fabulous every item was perfectly prepared. I am happy to spend money on food but $9.95 for 1 crab cake appetizer that is SMALLER than a hockey puck means I will be spending my $184.50 for 3 people at a much better restaurant. The cost for the quality is why this is NOT a 5 star review.  Food 10 stars value 2 stars.  I have had much better food for much lower price and much less waiting.  I'm sad. 
Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"John, our waiter was fantastic, took care of our needs on a timely basis and was very knowledgable of food and drink options.
We will return for more great food and drink."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux and Mammadeaux too~ This place is kicken for Happy Hour Mon-Fri 3pm to 6pm with crazy good food at great prices. Start off with the Blackened Oyster Fondue (under $10), Cold Boiled Shrimp (under $5), Fried Alligator (under $5) and a tall Blue Moon or Swamp Thing! The place packs up around 5ish and the Happy Hour prices only apply to the bar area. A band plays every Friday starting at 6. Good times!

The main restaurant is a great place for groups, however, can be a little loud for intimate dates. The menu is extensive with a lot of great choices.  Check out the website for menu details."}
{"text":"This seems like a great date place... it has clean, nice atmosphere and a lovely patio outside to enjoy when it's not ridiculously hot.

We arrived for lunch promptly at opening time (11 am) and the place got busy really fast.  We had very attentive service and our server was very friendly.  Fried alligator appetizers were wonderful (the secret IS the sauce) and I enjoyed my shrimp etouffee.  Banana pudding and pecan pie are both great as well.

A bit pricey (lunch for 2 w/ dessert plus tip $86) but fabulous! A great place to splurge."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time I have been there and it was the best experience this time.  The service was outstanding.  The waiter kept checking on us and refills came without asking (even after the bill was paid).  I ordered the naked fish selection: blacken costa rica mahi with dirty rice.  WOW, it was very tasty and delicious!  I ordered my fish well, the normally serve it medium.  I was so full, I did not make it to dessert.  The other ladies were impressed too.  One had the cedar planked salmon and the other had a greek salad.  No complaints from us..."}
{"text":"My Pappadeaux experiences have been different every time. But the negative has outweighed the positive. On a first visit a couple years ago I went with a group of friends and our children. We enjoyed various appetizers of Shrimp and Crawfish Fondeaux, Calamari and Fried Alligator - which the kids got a kick out of trying for the first time. All was tasty. I ordered a plank salmon with grilled asparagus. No complaints. We did have a mighty tasty watermelon cocktail that was refreshing and strong. 

A second visit was a little less desirable. I was meeting a friend for happy hour. It was late afternoon...about 4:30 and it was quite packed. I had my 11 year (at the time) old daughter with me but she was being picked up by a friend on the way home from work so I could enjoy an outing with a girlfriend. There was a wait to be seated and we wanted to sit at the bar anyways. There were a few chairs and we took a seat. I ordered a chocolate milk for my daughter and was told by the bartender, 'she's not allowed to sit in this area'. I said, 'Really? She's being picked up in 15 minutes anyways so it won't be long. She's sitting here.' Not to mention there was a table right NEXT to the bar behind us with 2 children at it. I'm sure he just didn't want the seat taken by a child and reduce his drink orders...but he was rude about it and I wasn't pleased. Almost wanted to leave. The rest of the visit was decent. Had a cocktail and appetizer with the girlfriend and then left. Bartender continued to NOT be friendly. 

3rd trip was a date night and my first time trying oysters. We ordered an appetizer to start and then a dozen oysters that came out later. My date gave me tips on how to eat. I enjoyed the first one. 2nd one we both ate...had debris, shell fragments, sand or whatever else might be in the oysters that aren't properly cleaned. We ended up returning the oysters and leaving disappointed and still hungry."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I was here for a company get together and was so impressed with the quality of food and service. I ordered the sea bass and it was absolutely to die for! I have heard great things about this restaurant and I'm glad I finally got to try it. I would recommend this place to everyone! I can not wait to go back and try some more! I'm not too sure what the cost is like because my meal was pre ordered for me."}
{"text":"Our last visit was horrible on every level and I am happy to say tonight  it was amazing on every level! Thank you Chris for the best service we have had in a very long time!
We will definitely ne back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for my birthday. We had a babysitter until 9pm. We got there at 6:15 and they told us it was going to be a 45 min wait. We spent $80 buck at the bar waiting before we were finally seated at 8:35?? We're ordered our appetizers and dinner walking to our table because we were now in a hurry? I mean come on guys get your times down a little better then that??"}
{"text":"My daughter turned 21 today-July 3rd. She wanted to celebrate at Pappadeaux. We ordered lunch. My husband and I split The sampler platter and my daughter ordered a crab and shrimp appetizer with a side salad with ranch dressing. We ordered water and our waiter Andrew brought us sliced lemon on the side.
We informed Andrew that my daughter has Celiac Disease and he explained the manager would be coming over to talk with us about the issue. The manager was very nice to us -- she wanted to make sure the food organization der was clear due to my daughter's Celiac Disease.
Our waiter, Andrew was very friendly; the atmosphere in the restaurant was great. We were seated by the window by a really nice hostess. 
The food was fresh, hot and delicious. Pappadeaux is a nice place to dine whether for lunch or dinner. I highly recommend this seafood dining establishment."}
{"text":"???? ??? ?????????????
   ???????????? ????? ??????????? ?? ????? ???????????"}
{"text":"Absolutely fell in love with this place!! Food is amazing!!! The service is too! Hubby & I had our Valentine dinner here and we loved it! Can't wait to go again & take my parents! 
The staff is amazing our server was very very kind and attentive he recommended food and he brought us a free desert!"}
{"text":"The Pappas restaurant group is always superb, with Pappadeaux being one of the best. Food is high quality and serving size is larger than most restaurants. Service is always attentive. Atmosphere is pure cajun. We tried the oysters on the half shell and shrimp gumbo for appetizers, the pan seared tilapia was outstanding, and for dessert the pumpkin pecan pie with ice cream was delicious. Wine list is extensive with wine by the glass available, and the bar is stocked with premiums too. Pappadeaux is highly recommended. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend in town and decided to go to Papadeaux, was not disappointed. We started off with the crab cakes and they were fantastic. Our fresh squeezed lemon aid was great and the stripped bass main was perfect! Our wait staff was friendly and quick to serve when asked, we will go there again. Say many other meals come out and they all looked fantastic! I don't think you could get a bad meal at Papadeaux!"}
{"text":"Lunch visit:  I dine here with work friends once or twice per year.  Huge fan of the seafood salad, frog legs, alligator, shrimp, catfish, and clam chowder.  I like the change of pace and it's large enough that you rarely have to wait being seated around noon.

For groups of 8-10 ask for the Wine Room off the bar for a more intimate dining experience with groups.  It's a nice quiet room where they store their wines, a great place to have conversation when you are with an oversized group.

The courtyard is nice transition zone from the parking lot and helps set mood.  Unfortunately when you get in it can be a bit noisy."}
{"text":"Spend your money elsewhere!

First time at Pappadeaux we had a bad experience with 1 staff member, brought it to the attention of management and were given a $50 gift card to make things right (was a pretty bad experience, not normally complainers)

When returned for a 2nd time, to use the gift card, the hostess sat our party of 3 in between 2-10+ person parties.  Our 4 person table was squished in between the 2 parties that when the server went to take people's orders at the big party she was literally standing over top of me, shouting to the people on the other side of the table.  We asked to move as they clearly had open tables in other areas that were not so cramped - it was such an ordeal to allow us to move 30 ft to a new table.

We get a new table and it takes 15-20 minutes before anyone comes over.  By this time it's about 6:15pm and we know happy hour is only until 6:30pm.  We asked for a round of drinks and are told happy hour is only available in the bar area.  WTF.

We decline ordering drinks at the table and one of use walks to the bar, orders happy hour priced drinks and brings them back to our table.  Genius!  Apparently this is frowned upon though, oh well.  And the happy hour drink prices are laughable, a sweet tea...whatever its called was $8 - what the hell does it cost non-happy hour.  

Their food is horribly over priced for what you get, its on par with Red Lobster and almost twice as expensive.  My friend ordered the stuffed crab and the server lets her know there is no crab in this dish, its 2 empty crab shells stuffed with breading, shrimp and fish bits.  12 shrimp cost about $17, I did not see any evidence that they had been dipped in gold prior to the fryer.  My friends Caesar salad has ONE lone crouton floating in the soggy, limp lettuce.  Our server, Jimmy was empathetic that we were having a rough experience and he gave us a creme brulee on the house.  Not to sound unappreciative, but I'm glad we didn't pay for it, was just meh.

Time to pay.  Our bill comes to $72.  We have the $50 gift card and throw in $40 in cash and decide to let Jimmy keep the difference which is a pretty nice tip, since he had given us dessert.  He picks up the check book and we tell him we are good, no change needed.  We start to get ready to leave and another server/manager perhaps comes over w/ a receipt showing we owe $18 after the gift card was charged.  The $40 has disappeared, did Jimmy think we gave him a $40 tip??  To avoid any further annoyance we just leave and leave the $18 DUE receipt on the table.  

Go to Red Lobster :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood spot when in TX. Glad they have a location in PHX!  We had lunch here and we were extremely satisfied with the service we had with our server Jaclyn. Jaclyn was timely, very polite, attentive, and has a great sense humor.  Jaclyn is overall fantastic!  When you have a server like Jaclyn, everything else will fall into place.  Great food and drinks!  Thank you Jaclyn!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to try Papaadeauxs on a Friday during Lent. We were not disappointed. The service was superior. Our waitress always checked on us and made sure we always had full drinks. 

We ordered the oysters papaadeaux and the only thing I'd say is they were a bit salty, but nonetheless delicious. The creme brûlée also did not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Service was the best I've had and definitely will be coming back again for it. Food was exquisite and very tasteful. We tried the frog legs for the first time thanks to our server, Joey. He made our whole experience the best experience we've ever had thus far at Pappadeaux. We will be back to see Joey!"}
{"text":"Usually I don't give four stars to a chain, BUT Pappadeaux is usually pretty good and this one being this far west I am a fan. I do live in Las Vegas, but when I goto Phoenix I try to swing by here at least once every trip. 

The boudin is always something that I get here, it is usually pretty good. If I am alone this is enough for me to eat along with a glass of wine. 

If I am dining with others I try to get some alligator along with some other type of sea food appetizer so that I can have a variety. 

All of the sea food is good here, but not as good as their locations on the coast, you just can't beat the freshness of the sea food on the gulf coast!"}
{"text":"Seafood is so fresh here! And cooked to perfection.Surprisingly this place is affordable too. Makes red lobster look like a mc donalds in terms of quality."}
{"text":"So good! Fresh seafood in the middle of the desert? Yes, that's possible. However don't fill up on their delicious apps like I did. Service was a bit bleh but the food made up for it. Get here early because it fills up fast. I'm from SoCal so coming all the way to Phoenix for good seafood surprised me!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my friend and the wait time was horrible. It took them 2 hours to sit us because they were so busy. However the service was amazing and the food here is to die for. Honestly worth the 2 hours wait but still too long to wait for food. That's how you lose customers. When seated noticed there were many tables open..... The bus boys took their sweet time cleaning tables and didn't seem to care. If they're faster people can get seated a lot sooner."}
{"text":"I've been to Pappadeaux a couple of times since my initial visit and review. Most visits have been pretty good - the worst was when they lost my reservation completely even though I could prove I called and everything. Luckily we got there fairly early so the wait for a table wasn't TOO long. The visit was off to a rocky start and the service was ok. 

We decided to give Pappadeaux another chance and skipped the reservation this time (after what happened last time). We were seated in the alcove area which was nice, minus the fact our waitress kept forgetting about us. Water was warm and nearly hot, food arrived without silverware, bread basket never arrived, we had to ask several times for side plates. Luckily the food was still delicious in spite of the mediocre service. 

We ordered the lobster salad which is a favorite, the fried alligator, the shrimp and grits, coconut shrimp and key lime pie. Although the key lime pie was a standard key lime pie it was delicious! The coconut shrimp stole the show for sure, we ended up liking it better than the alligator (which is why we started coming here)."}
{"text":"The epitome of a 4-star restaurant.

Very good food, very large portions, lots of menu options. service was friendly, but not totally unrushed. Try the fried alligator and cajun bloody mary. Also, shrimp is delicious

Food was somewhat overpriced. Wait times are long on Friday nights."}
{"text":"Very nice place to get seafood. Huge restaurant with lots of seating. The food was very good, I had crawfish bisque and the salmon Yvette. The food was served quickly. My waitress was great she was attentive, friendly and talkative. I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"I am not a seafood fan, but this place has changed my point of view. The quality of food, atmosphere and service are absolutely great! We started with the crab spinach dip. The server described it as more of a spread and she was right! It was so thick and had chunks of crab meat. It was so savory and decadent. We had never had dirty rice so the waitress brought out a \"sample\" of it. First of all it was basically a side of rice and second it was DELICIOUS! We finished the whole side and also got it with our meal. I got sea bass and my husband had a scallop, shrimp and mahi mahi combo. Everything was excellent! I'm such a fan of this great, fresh seafood! Not to mention, the excellent customer service was so refreshing."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux has been my go to ever since I moved here.  I remember spending a night at their bar watching Kim blow the D-Back's lead in the World Series while eating some fried alligator.  

Since then I have learned to appreciate food more and have become quite fond of Pappadeaux, especially during happy hour.  Pappadeaux's has never let me down in regards to food.  When you sit at the bar the service is sometimes, more often then not, lacking (hence the reason for only four stars).  

You can't go wrong with the Oysters, and their Po' Boys are on point.  If you are there for dinner anything you order is sure to please, but maybe try the seafood platter.  Pretty sure we have sampled most of the menu, which does change.  If you have never had Alligator, try it!!  I can go on and on, but again I don't remember a menu item I did not like or would not recommend.  Me not being a dessert fan it is hard, but I would recommend the key lime pie.

Pappadeaux's you are a treat, thank you for the fresh product and refreshing drink."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: if you're looking for the best oysters in town, look no further than Pappadeaux.  I typically avoid chain restaurants like they've got the plague but... Pappadeaux is one that is certain to be a crowdpleaser.

The menu is filled with lots of Cajun fanfare. Whether you're in the mood for Crab Louie, gumbo, bisque, shrimp or crawfish étouffée, fried seafood, scallops, alligator or lobster, Pappadeaux has you covered. 

Today we enjoyed a dozen Gulf oysters as a starter. Next, my wife dined on the bacon wrapped shrimp with cheese and jalapeño and I have the crawfish étouffée and shrimp. 

Our server Kirk was awesome!  The one-way only access road entrance location is kinda weird if you don't know how to get to it but it is simple enough.  

I'm already looking forward to returning for a few dozen oysters!"}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing bad on the menu. Try the blackened alligator, really delicious. Giant shrimp and grits is my favorite. Pasta Mardi Gras is another favorite."}
{"text":"Second time eating here and each time has been outstanding! Fantastic service, top notch food. Happy hour offers nice range of foods to choose from and they're all excellent. Alligator was great, shrimp and the mini fondeaux (sp) was all amazing. Will be back as often as time and my wallet allows!"}
{"text":"Come on! Who doesn't love this place?! The best seafood from down south Cajun style or not, you cannot beat this menu! I know it's a little pricey, but the food is always super fresh and delicious. A great place to go for a nice broiled lobster! The specialty drinks are yummy."}
{"text":"Ate here on a recent trip to Phoenix and loved it. We had a group of 16 guys, mostly drunk and they even put our meals on separate checks without us asking. Gratuity included of course. I had Penne Pasta with chicken as I am allergic to shell fish and had no worries watching everyone else engulf lobster tail, gumbo and crab claws."}
{"text":"This place is right by my folks house and I have been here many times. Great happy hour spot to. I have had so many things on this menu its rediculous. They have deep fried aligator app that is so good. Inside they have a lobster tank with for sure the biggest lobsters I have ever seen. Today I went for lunch and got the Crispy Halibut sanwich and fries. They gave me shoestring fries, if you get fries make sure you get the regular fries cause shoe string fries look cute but they are just annoying. The sandwich was so good, and it was a big piece of halibut for $12.95. My girlfriend got the wood fired talapia with greenbeans, shrimp, and veggy. It was so good and the lunch price $13.95. She usually gets the crab legs and like i said, so many good things i get something different everytime. Nice big bar with a few boths and the dinning area is huge. This place can get busy at night and especialy on the weekends but its worth the wait if you have to."}
{"text":"This restaurant is our all time favorite seafood place. food is excellent, they never failed us . seafood is fresh like we leave near water. I always order the fish opelousa comes with rice, bread is great. Oysters are very fresh I live in surprise and I don't mind driving here every week"}
{"text":"Ok. Nice entrance. Needs to have an ambiance update! Someone call Gordon Ramsey STAT. Established in 1986, and every bit of carpet and mirrored walls to prove it. Food, Lobster bisque was good. Seems more of a place for drinks though. The waitress messed up our order, so we weren't too impressed. A bit pricey too. Not going to go back."}
{"text":"So I kept driving by his place a bunch of times so I figured I would give it a try . I pulled up and noticed this is a large ass reasuraunt good thing I went on a monday night, I got seated quickly and got a menu in hand. Getting ready to order will review shortly....
Started out w lobster bisque which was good there was enough lobster chunks to make it worth while to eat

For main course I got house salmon , portion was large and the shrimp was a nice touch they added to the dish

Overall nice seafood place to take a date to and plenty of things to choose from"}
{"text":"I made reservations to surprise my boyfriend because he loves eating here (minus this time).  We were early and the people who were walking in, were seated before us ( I was listening to see if they had reservations, and they did not).  We were standing right in front, by the hostess stand and people just kept coming in and were seated.  Finally my boyfriend went up to one of the young girls and she said \"oh, sure, we can seat you now\".  UMMMM WTF!!!!  What was the point of making a reservation if it wasn't even used to our advantage?  Complete BS.  The food, eh... it was so so.  We had a waiter who was CLUELESS.  He didn't know the specials, if there were even any.  We didn't get any bread, he said the oven wasn't working properly but mind you, people who were sat AFTER us were getting fresh bread.. The kid knew we were pretty pissed so he gave us a free desert.  Big deal.  I personally have zero desire to ever go back to this location."}
{"text":"The best seafood in the desert !! The service is top tier. I had the bacon wrapped shrimp and my wife had the lobster and both were pure heaven. There is none better."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Decided to give this place another chance with a new to town seafood living couple because it was fresh the last time I went. After calling ahead of time, they said the wait would be 15 minutes. It was 45. We have been here for almost two hours, no food on the table yet. I am starving. There are so many people, the waiters are stretched so thin. My little lunch just became dinner...."}
{"text":"Not sure how seafood in the middle of the desert gets this good.  I live in socal near the ocean and this place blows doors on any of the restaurants in my local area.  Every time I travel to Phoenix, I will eat here."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and they have a huge selection of items on the menu. I think it's a bit overpriced but the service is great."}
{"text":"came out on Tuesday night after hearing all those positive reviews. I had high hopes for this place especially since the entrees were mostly $18-45 each. I ordered a crayfish platter, a sausage and seafood gumbo, and then a shrimp brochette. My friend ordered a pan seared tilapia. My friend's tilapia had jumbo shrimp and crab meat on top. The tilapia tasted moist but under-seasoned along with the shrimp. The shrimp was crisp but that was the only good thing about it. As for my gumbo, the muddy taste of the oyster ruined it for me. The crayfish platter was NASTY!! The fried crayfish half was ok but nothing special. The crayfish creole part tasted DISGUSTING along with the dirty rice. I tried one bite and then told the waitress to take it away for me. My waitress recommended another entree for me which was the shrimp brochette. It was another huge disappointment. The bacon and cheese wrapped around the jumbo shrimp was so overpowering and fattening that I couldn't take another bite. The manager came over to apologize and took the two items I ordered off our tab but I don't think I will come back again....charging such high prices for bad quality food #smh"}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter for my 45th birthday and I couldn't have been happier with my meal. We started with crab claws which had an amazing sauce. Personally, I don't think the rice on the plate with this app was necessary; a few extra claws would've been way better. My daughter ordered pasta with shrimp and scallops which she loved it. I had the salmon with shrimp and scallops over sautéed spinach. Both of our meals also had crab meat on top. My daughter had leftovers, I'm happy to say I did not! After dinner our server brought us the dessert tray which was on the house for birthdays. We had the banana pudding that came in a mason jar that we got to take home. Raised in Florida makes me picky about my seafood and although this place was a bit of a drive, I will go back for more than just a birthday dinner. Kudos for making great seafood in the middle of the desert!"}
{"text":"So I love seafood.    And at times I find pappadeaux over priced for what they are serving.   They have a good atmosphere and good drinks.   Fish is brought in daily - of whatever they are running low on.   So it is freshish sea food."}
{"text":"First off... the smoking section is to open and close to the people waiting to be called for their tables... I don't mind this so much as i hate watching a stand-in hostess stuff her face with crackers while we wait 20 minutes (which turned in to longer, of course while people that got there after us went in before we did...) We get to our table and get the most lethargic and unresponsive waitress we could possibly get. Great we get our order in with no feedback or questions on how we want anything cooked or substitutes on sides or how we want our potatoes... absolutely unacceptable. Get our drinks and my SO's drink cup has a layer of grease film on the top of his Extremely watered down coke... yummy. Menus left on the table, extra silver on the table. Our waitress didn't even clear anything off and just let it all pile up. We ordered calamari and get this microwaved, freeze burn crap that tasted like rubber on some pieces and gushy  on others... gross. Look at the extra plate left on the other side of our already cluttered table and it had food flecks on it.... Absolutely disgusting. Will NEVER go back there again. bad bad bad."}
{"text":"Great food. 
Fantastic service. 
Lovely atmosphere. 

Dinner was absolutely Delicious. 
I wasn't sure if I liked some of the sauces that came on the entree & the waitress had me taste everything before I made my final choice. It was a busy night & she apologized for our food not being up faster, without me even complaining about it, & gave us 20% of our bill! 

The atmosphere was casual & relaxed. The staff is so friendly & welcoming, you just can't help but feel comfortable & happy to be there! 

They have a return customer in me :)"}
{"text":"I had the coconut shrimp several years ago and wanted to take my family. The shrimp did not disappoint, including the lovely Asian slaw mix that is used as a garnish. When our meal arrived, however, it was rather disappointing. The fried shrimp was good, but not special.  The catfish had a nice breading, however there was little flavor. The big surprise though was the French fries. The majority of them were cold. There were a few warm fries mixed in, leading us to believe that the kitchen was aware of the situation. I don't really think we will be back again. It was an ok meal for a good meal price."}
{"text":"My server Esther was super nice and helpful. We talked a little too much, felt like I was hogging her from others. I'm sure she didn't mind as she carried half the conversation.

I ordered the appetizer of macaroni and cheese with seafood. And the Pasta Mardi Gras. Both delicious and large servings! Most I took home as we were talking so much my full signal went off. 

It's on the expensive side, but the food, service and decor makes it worth it."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Date night was a blast. Food was hot and we did not have to wait long. Drinks were not watered down. Atmosphere was very delightful."}
{"text":"Simply terrific!!! Our waitress Audrey was the best!!! The food was delicious so happy we went out. I had the Pappadeaux platter way more than enough for two. The atmosphere was amazingly relaxing and welcoming. Best customer service I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Came here on a Saturday night with no reservations and got in a table in 20 min with a packed restaurant. The server was very knowledgeable of the menu and had a answer for every question  I asked. Great service never waited long for drinks and food came out quicker then expected for a full house. The portions were huge and everything I ate had lots of flavor. Seafood was the freshest I've had and lots of it. Ill definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"I do not like seafood, I'll make that very clear. This is a place in which both my family and my fiance's family likes. I keep an open mind no matter what so though I ordered the chicken linguini pasta I tried the calamari, coconut shrimp and the naked halibut. All of which were quite amazing, which says a lot for somebody who isn't fond of seafood. 
Our server (Nick) was amazing, on top of drinks and kept the entire group of 10 happy. It was a wonderful experience. For a family event or special event I would definitely return. The prices are a bit scary for my taste though. As a college student, you can't really blame me though."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I don't like expensive, crowded restaurants where we have a long wait for a table so right off the top I was a bit annoyed. And the only place they could seat us was out side in Phoenix in nearly 100 degree heat ... again not something I wanted or enjoy.

But all was corrected once our meals arrived. There were nine of us and everyone got a very different entree...not one would I have been unhappy being served. 

The Mixed Seafood Grill looked amazing, the lobster tails delicious,  salads were huge and piled high with salmon and lobster. Several melt in your mouth fried platters and creole favorites left nothing lacking. 

Overpriced maybe, but some of the best seafood I've had for a long time. And this was land locked Phoenix which seems funny since we live steps from the ocean in southern California."}
{"text":"The food is good. It's not like the restaurants in Texas. But Crawfish, Andouille sausage, Red Beans and Rice are my favorite."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The Happy Hour food is awesome!! Especially the seafood fondue!! The atmosphere is charming!! Love the patio!!"}
{"text":"I love their lobster bisque and Pecan/Praline cheesecake. The stuffed crabs and fried crawfish are also very delicious. Its a little pricey but its worth it more often than not."}
{"text":"Live this place!!! My favorite thing to have here is blackened Puerto rican mahi, it's so tasty...I'm only allowed to eat fish once a week but if I could I would eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Terrible service! 

Cold Mahi Mahi Alexander. Cold Andouille Sausage Gumbo. Cold hard bread. Server Renee B had zero personality, wasn't helpful, didn't bring silver wear until well after the meals were delivered. Never came back to check in us. If she did she would have learned that our food was cold and we didn't have silverware. I understand the place is super busy, but none of the other servers seemed to have a problem checking on their tables. I'm sorry, but there is just no excuse for bad customer service.

And what kind of manager doesn't acknowledge when a mistake by his staff or kitchen has been made? Not even an apology? Shame on you Philip! I came from Cali to patronize your establishment and this is how you treat your customers? Not sure I'd return."}
{"text":"One of the BEST CAJUN SEAFOOD restaurant that I've eaten at! Vontae our server was spot on with his recommendations from the Blackened Alligator, Cajun Crabcakes and Pasta Mardi Gras with extra sauce on the side. I HIGHLY recommend checking this place out, the menu is stacked with seafood entrees with fish flown in daily & everything is made from scratch. Be prepared for an even more pleasant dining experience if you are fortunate to have Vontae as your server. Can't say enough great things about this place. Kudos to Vontae as this was my first time eating here & in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. 

Make reservations or call and get your name on the list at least one hour early....the wait is often 1-2 hours.

Yes it is a chain.  WHO CARES.

The quality is always top notch.  The service is great.  The fish is ultra super fresh 10,000 (if you end anything with 10,000 it means it is the best.)

Most fish are flown in only in season.  Right now you can get a lb of crawfish or a dozen oysters on the half shell for $3.95 (Wednesday nights it he best because fresh shell fish come in that morning.)

PS- Awesome and economic happy hour."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant I've ever been to. Seafood flown in fresh everyday and all the sauces are made from scratch everyday."}
{"text":"We visited Pappadeaux last April.  The old man and I were visiting  from out of town. 
Well we chose to visit during some kind of bike week. Reservations were out of the question so we were put on the wait list. We waited about 2 hours before we were seated. But hey it is what it is! Once we were seated things started running like clockwork. Like I said the place was bursting outside of the seams. However our server treated us like we were the only people in the house.
Its been over a year since our visit. The food was good,  I totally forgot what we ordered with the exception of  a Greek Salad that I split with my brother. It was massive.
So 5 stars here...We are visiting Phoenix in July. I will be calling ahead for reservations and plan on going to lunch as well as dinner."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was not impressed. Started off with the appetizer oysters pappadeaux and alligator which were very good. The wife and I had the sampler platter the tilapia was dry and not very good, you couldn't tell the difference between the shrimp, crawfish or chicken tenderloins everything was fried. Had Four Peaks beer on top which was delicious and the service was great and the atmosphere was pleasant. The food was not worth the money. $70"}
{"text":"We went here early on New Year's Eve. There were 8 of us  in our party . They were very, very busy. Even with being that busy, our server, Joshua, was very friendly, helpful and efficient. Our water and drink glasses were kept full.  
We had a full variety of appetizers and entrees. Everyone agreed the food was excellent except for  the salmon  which was  overcooked and a bit dry . The
 price on the food was probably average for the kind of food, the service and the restaurant ambience.  It was cool enough that most people were eating inside, but they do have a nice outside area and they have a nice area where people wait for the reservations. They did take reservations until 4:30 and after that it was first come first serve."}
{"text":"Always very impressed when I go. Everyone is very personable, and never get a bad waiter. Everyone seems happy to be at work. My company host some team builders there and have always had great service. For my birthday I receive two gift cards to there and can not wait to cash in. Just an all around great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Since my last review of Pappa, we've been back about eight times. In fact, six of those times were to celebrate my or my hubby's birthdays, which are two weeks apart. Last visit was last Saturday, the 8th; previous was Dec 26th. This review update could fit either visit. 

Again- quoted 45-50 min wait, but vultured around the bar until a couple of seats opened up and dumped our table wait. It was CRAZY busy this time, with all of the folks in town for BCS, etc. 

Oysters - wow. They were HUGE, delicious and showed up quickly. Our shucker even came by, after we were finished, to ask if we were happy with our order. Boy howdy, yes we were. 

Hubby got filet mignon w/Alaskan King crab compliment; I got my usual crab cake on lemon-caper sauced crawfish bed (sweet potato garnish changed up to fried onion strings with a tomato-y relish on top, yum!). We were both 100% happy with the food. When I mentioned to our bartender (he gets his own paragraph) that it was hubby's birthday, he offered the normal comped dessert (key lime pie, MMMM), but threw in a bonus gift: the rum bottle token. It was appropriate; my hubby had sampled five different rum drinks during our meal. (Pirate Punch was my favorite!) 

Ben was our bartender; he was just incredible!! Before we even got seats at the bar, Ben was asking what drink he could make for us. In fact, despite the extremely busy and loud atmosphere, his excellent and attentive service made it feel like he was our personal server - and I noticed that he was giving everyone around his end of the bar the same service. He is just that great! Or maybe he was just that happy that the Colts lost... :). Another 'tender, Kim, also kept a great eye on us and other nearby patrons, whenever Ben had stepped away. Our thanks to them both, for an absolutely fabulous experience which guarantees the future of our 3-year-old birthday tradition!"}
{"text":"Very delicious never had food like this before I'm from san diego so this was new for the family i hope they consider putting a location out here i know the people would love it"}
{"text":"We arrived with our large family on a Tuesday nite. The initial hostess was kind in taking our name and setting up a table; however the gal she had setting up the table gave an ugly look when told that there would be two adults and 8 children. 

We were sat close to the hostess stand and upon leaving the second gal was much nicer. It just is frustrating to assume that all kids will be have badly!

The food was ok. It's been a few years since we've been and it didn't seem to live up to the expectations we had. The flavors were nice but the selection of only fish with no shellfish seemed small. The only non seafood appetizer option was mozzarella sticks. That was a bummer. 

I asked the server for her recommendation and she suggested the grilled chicken. This doesn't really build your faith in the seafood restaurant if the servers favorite is chicken. 

Bottom line, it's ok but not worth the price!"}
{"text":"I don't care for the dirty rice or the gumbo. Lobster salad isn't worth your money. But nearly every fish entree I've had was delicious. The raw oysters are also so fresh. The mac n cheese appetizer is especially good. Pasta Mardi Gras is a MUST whenever I come. If I don't have it for dinner I'll order it as a take out to have lunch the next day. It's that good. The service here is also usually excellent and I haven't had bad dessert. Overall, it's one of my favorite restaurants for special occasions. But if you go with a group of 4+ people, just know that you will have to shout across the table to be heard! The restaurant is very loud! I actually came home with a sore voice.."}
{"text":"09/07/12

The place is huge and beautiful inside and outside. The entrance is somewhat hidden.

The service is very friendly and helpful from the moment that you enter, and there are employees everywhere!

I ordered the handcrafted strawberry lemonade. It was delicious.

I inquired about the spiciness of the crawfish étouffée, and ordered it with a request to kick up the Cajun a bit. I've been craving for some good étouffée since a recent visit to a place in Bakersfield.

The crawfish étouffée was excellent, the portions are huge. My order was accidentally split in half, and each half was huge! 

Yummy...

A freshly baked loaf of bread was delivered to my table.

Robert was a great server and did a great job! Thanks robert!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were so glad we found this restaurant. I'm originally from Louisiana and was looking forward to some Cajun fare. I wasn't disappointed. I started with a Captain's Hurricane cocktail and it was very tasty. Then I had the andouille sausage and shrimp gumbo and it was fantastic - full of flavor aroma and perfectly cooked ingredients. My main meal was a platter of half fried crawfish tails and half crawfish ettouffe (sp), with a border of dirty rice in between. It was all so good and flavorful! Almost as good as I've ever had in Louisiana. My wife had the salmon topped with shrimp and crab. Normally she complains that the salmon is not just right or overcooked, but this time she said it was prepared perfectly. Finally we had the vanilla crew brûlée and it too was as good as we've ever eaten.  We were glad that we enjoyed our meal outside on the patio since it seemed a lot less loud than the indoor dining areas. Our waiter, Brent was outstanding in his craft, and was pleasant to talk with. Our only complaint is that each course seemed at least 25% more expensive than it should have been. Next time in Phoenix we will stop again for hopefully another very satisfying dining experience."}
{"text":"I CRAVE their etouffee, their lobster bisque, and this amazing seafood dip with tons of cheese and cream and delicious garlic baguette. OH man, I'm making myself hungry right now!  It's sooo nice to have a great N'awwluns restaurant in north Phoenix. Go early to get a seat for happy hour or plan on standing around!!! They will steam your oysters if your boyfriend wants them that way and they will give you samples of different drinks if you can't make up your mind about what you want.  They have great happy hour specials!  The music is great, too.  I go there for my birthday every year, it's a great tradition that I love and transports you out of the desert (which a former friend who shall remain nameless once described as a \"godforsaken wasteland\" what a jerk) to the decadent, delightful, deep south. I've been going there for 5 plus years now and the servers are very professional and attentive. It's a fun, different, and top notch dining experience. Wear something elastic or that allows you to loosen the belt, ha ha."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the food was good.  The wine was great, so we'll be going back again!"}
{"text":"If you like seafood, then this seems to be the place. Personally I don't eat any seafood but came with friends. To my surprise, I really liked the scallops. They were the best cooked scallop I have ever had, which says a lot for someone that really dislikes the taste of ocean creatures! I love the creole inspired dishes and the warm bread that comes as an appetizer. Service was also great!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We went tonight, the Sunday  before Labor Day, and it was quite busy. We were quoted 45 minutes, but we were called after 15 minutes. We decided to stay at the intimate, quiet bar. Our app, the trio, took awhile, but was so worth it! We replaced the calamari, which they were out of, with more alligator. The app was great! I loved the fondeaux, but my hubby thought the alligator, which was usually moist, was king of dry. We ordered the horseradish plank tilapia and the porchartrain. The tilapia was a bit dry, without sauce. I loved my fish, but I feel like there wasn't enough sauce. The service at the bar was awesome. We will definitely return, but maybe try new entrees. The potions are huge, so we will have a great lunch."}
{"text":"Food here is really good ..had the fried platter which consisted of crawfish, shrimp, fish. Couldn't finish ...!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place twice in one week! First time in on a Sunday, and second time on a Thursday.  Making a road trip and passing through Phoenix, we saw this place.  Cajun & Seafood will alway catch my attention.  Ordered a dozenoysters both times-- Amazing! Menu was great, all the tasty cajun seafood creations that any spicy cajun lover will be in love with.
If I lived closer, I would be a regular here.  
Totally recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there last night!  Yum!!!!! So fresh and delicious, and the staff, the staff, truly amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here because my friend had posted so many yummy looking pictures .
It had a nice ambiance but I was pretty underwhelmed by the food for as expensive as it was .
The service was great, the drinks were good but I could have made better seafood @ home .
The catfish wasn't crispy or as flavorful as delicious catfish should be .
The crab cake was good but the stuffed shrimp and crab just tasted like a hush puppy .. which I'm not a fan of, so maybe that's just me ."}
{"text":"I really love coming here.. even if we only come here for sometime of celebration but every time it's soooooo worth it!
My husband and I have been here 4 times now and every time it's been nothing but the best dinner ever. 
A must you must get or try whatever floats your boat is the alligator tail. Don't be so quick to judge this taste appetizer we usually get half blacked half deep fried. Our 8 year old says it's his favorite thing to get when we come. And we all know kids are picky but he loves it.
Our last time in we got that and we got the trio which came with calamari, this mini shrimp/crawfish cheese dip and the alligator tail. The dip was amazing only down side is that it only came with 2 little slices of bread we were a large party of 8. 
I always go in and get the giant shrimp with giants it's a no fail amazing dish. My husband is always daring and willing to try something different but his all time favorite to get is Atlantic salmon Yvette... it's his favorite other then the gumbo lol.
And you can't leave without getting a dessert
Come eat make a reservation before you come in
It's amazing"}
{"text":"Great, unique, seafood dishes! Not to much for the dieter! Good food, and fun atmosphere !"}
{"text":"Waitress Crystal was Excellent.. A big thank you to her for being patient with us. Our first time here and the menu is overwhelming but awesome choices. 

Our drinks Mojito and my Tom Collins both were Superb... We had to do two rounds! 

Appetizers simply delicious coconut shrimp and alligator!! Fresh and crispy mmmm good! 

Halibut was out of this world fresh with delicious butter seasoning! 

The sampler trio with blue crab :) beyond amazing!
Loved the fried fish, stuffed ball of crab cake was a slam dunk in my belly. 

We ordered the gumbo.. Woohoo SPICY!

Red beans and Rice boy there was a Cajun party going on.. spicy! 

Cheese grits omgggg sooo heavenly! 

No room for deserts tonight but we Will be back next trip here to beautiful Phoenix! 

Thank you Again Crystal.. She really made our experience a delightful experience!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner we were a party of four everyone was very pleased with what they ordered and service was excellent. We also ordered dessert we ordered an assortment of desserts the one that absolutely hands down was my favorite was the pumpkin cheesecake ohhh soooo delicious if you like pumpkin and cheesecake which I happen to love both unfortunately it is a seasonal dessert. The reason I give it four stars is just that it is very pricey but it is sort of a fine dining place. I would definitely eat here again from time to time."}
{"text":"One of our favorite family places to eat at.  Large proportions from a large menu from a cook to order kitchen.  Most of the time we just share appetizers instead of ordering a meal.  It's fresh seafood flown in daily so be prepared to pay for it.  They get very busy but worth the wait & we've always had good to great service.  My only complaint is they are a 45 min. drive away wish they would open another restaurant in the SE valley."}
{"text":"I think its overpriced-sure its seafood which is expensive but still. The food was mostly just average tasting for the cost. I do recommend their fondue shrimp/crawfish dip. However their shrimp creole, bread, salad, and fried crab with fries tasted just ok. I was also let down that they didn't just serve plain crab legs-for a big seafood place something is wrong with this picture. Service was excellent and I did like the atmosphere tho."}
{"text":"Seafood Grandeur. Reminded me fondly of the great seafood days I had in New England and Boston in the past. The fish and chips (two-headed fried shrimp, fried tilapia, french fries) is so very New England. The Blackened Mahi Alexander is so creative they put shredded crawfish on top. You may choose something other as an entree, but please do yourself a favor and order the Lobster Bisque, which isn't only brisk bisque but also generous with lobster bites. You'll be full, so don't even dream of somersaults afterwards not unless you're purging."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service, first time, plan on returning to try some other menu items, fried alligator was delicious, the Filet Mignon & Grilled Caribbean Lobster was excellent.
Great selection of appetizers for happy hour."}
{"text":"Thanks for making my birthday dinner horrible! First, I would like to say that our waitress was courteous and very nice, but the food tonight was inedible! My hubby took me here for my birthday dinner, it was my favorite place and we have been coming here for 8 years. I ordered the lobster bisque and he ordered the clam chowder. Both soups were very very salty, but I was ok with that and ate half my soup. For the main course, he ordered the blackened catfish and I got the sea bass. My hubby took one bite of the fish and knew it was bad. I took a bite and yes it was very bad, not just bad in taste, but it tasted rank/sour. My sea bass was good, but what made me mad was that we told the waitress and she said she would have the manager come over and talk to us...... We waited and waited.... I ate my dinner alone while my hubby had nothing....... Finally the waitress came over and after two glasses of liquid courage, I gave her a piece of my mind. Evidently, that brought the manager over. My hubby didn't want to risk another choice from the menu and I was finished eating. They comped our meal, but that didn't make my birthday any better.... And Pappadeaux, no need to respond to my review because no apology is going to be good enough to have me dine in your establishment again."}
{"text":"good food quantities and seafood if you like creole style."}
{"text":"The hostess was very rude. They don't like large party's and are un willing to accommodate large parties. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for family gatherings"}
{"text":"$20 for a double Maker's Mark?  Me thinks not T.G.I. McPappadeaux.  I was not impressed by anything that was there and will not only steer clear but may avoid the I-17 all together."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been there twice within the past 2 years, the second time to see if they could redeem themselves after our horrible first visit.

Service ~ fair: our host never established eye contact and it felt as though we were being seated at a buffet. Our server - although very nice, was inept. Appetizers took 30 min to arrive, then she asked if it would be okay the serve our main courses at the same time. We said no and continued. We finished our appetizers and about 20 min. later the server made to back to our table. Our main course meals were horrible both overcooked overcooked, reheated or whatever, not edible. We spoke with the manager, returned the food, paid and left. The bill would have been $100.+ for very substandard food but the manager did credit us for the bad food. Our server never offered to refill our drinks (beer and mixed drink) pure profit for the biz. We left once again disappointed with service and food.
The thing is my wife wants to give it a (perhaps final) try again today (about 3 months from the last visit. I will report back"}
{"text":"So our night begins with arriving at Pappadeaux at 6pm with my family for my mother birthday. Wait time is an hour to an hour and half (which is to be expected for a family of 17 on a Friday night). We are finally seated at 745pm and dinner orders are taken within 10-15mins. Time ticks away and no food, more time and still no food. Asked our server, along with another server and what seems to be a manager and all three gave us the same seemingly rude perhaps rehearsed responses which basically blamed us for having a large party. As a paying customer we should NEVER be treated as an inconvenience or daunting task. Again it's to be expected to have a wait for our food BUT NEVER place blame and attitude on your customers! I'm so disappointed and saddened to see my mothers birthday dinner ruined, especially after seeing and hearing her excitement all week. Her favorite cake was also brought to the restaurant but by that point mom was so upset she just took the cake home! After so many years of enjoying Pappadeaux, I will never again let a restaurant spoiled a family members birthday!"}
{"text":"Amazing Seafood!
I hope they bring this place to Vegas!
This was my 2nd Time business the restaurant I had previously visited the one in Atlanta. The restaraunt in Atlanta had an area that displayed the seafood nicely which this location did not. But they did have a live band on this Saturday night on the patio that was actually pretty good. 
I ordered the lobster bisque and stuffed crab the Lobster bisque was super creamy hot and decadent !
The stuffed crab was full of delish delicate seafood and lightly fried. The seafood was fresh in both dishes. 
I also ordered a cocktail that had fresh muddled raspberries and it was very refreshing.
The turtle brownie sundae was amazing and also decadent. A great dessert for sharing. 
Hope to see more locations pop up on west coast!"}
{"text":"The food here is so yummy. It's never a disappointment. Our server was very friendly and super quick. Only negative is they don't take reservations so if you're going on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait. On a good note the outdoor waiting area is large and has beautiful waterfalls and firepits."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Cajun restaurants in Phoenix.  I enjoy this place immensely, but I wish they had more steamed/grilled than fried foods.

I did have the shrimp and grits, which was out of this world delicious!"}
{"text":"First things first, we had a waiter named Samuel that was the best waiter that we have ever had. We never had to ask for anything he simply provided everything. Go Samuel! I had the Tilapia Ladeaux, my son had the sampler platter. Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"I went there as part of a work team lunch. Since we were a big group and didn't have much time, my manager asked me to call in our orders. The person on the phone told me we couldn't do this at first but then luckily the manager did allow it. 
Our table was ready when we arrived and food was on the table right at 12 o'clock when they said it would be. That was very nice. 
The place itself is just beautiful. I really liked the style and feel of the restaurant. The food looked beautiful too. 
I had the medium seafood lunch salad. It was ok. I wasn't impressed. I couldn't taste the dressing at all so I asked for more. They also brought out some bread and butter. Everyone else's food looked pretty good. Service wasn't bad either considering we were 8 people. 
I do feel like my experience isn't complete yet. I definitely have to go back to try some other things on the menu. I love seafood so I'm happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"I walked in and 3 employees stood and stared and smiled at me... No greeting or anything until I asked \"should I leave?\"   Finally they woke up one said hello and asked if I was waiting for another person in my party.  Now I don't know of they just don't get single parties... Or maybe it was my tshirt and jeans (clean and groomed)  but by this point I was getting frustrated and I had not even been seated yet.   My server was more professional.   I had seafood gumbo ( which was sour)  I've never had sour gumbo before. Terrible .   The lobster bisque made up for it,    Over $31 for two boils of soup and a sweet tea.  Also restaurant with only 1/2 of the tables filled it was extremely noisy.  Only good thing was server Audrey B. sweet tea and bisque.   I think I'll not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Pappadeaux.  I always end up spending way too much.  The drinks are strong, yet delicious and their seafood dishes are to die for."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour!! Great service. Love the shrimp poorboy and loved the gulf oysters! Boiled Shrimp decent. Prices are high if you miss happy hour but an excellent place for business dinners."}
{"text":"I loved this place. My boyfriend and I went here for our two year anniversary and received excellent service. 

We had to cancel our original reservation and we're able to make another for later in the evening. When we arrived we were seated right away and our server was awesome! She made sure our drinks were never empty, kept the boyfriend's beer filled and took her time discussing the options with us. 

The food was sooooooo gooooood, extra letters needed. Based on the reviews we orders the gator tail. We were so full we couldn't order dessert. 

And then to top it off, I was so happy, full, and distracted, I forgot my purse at the table. Our server chased after us and returned it, what an awesome chick. She was a blonde white chick (can't remember her name, it's been about 5 months), so if you get her you are in good hands!"}
{"text":"One our faves, and now our new favorite bartender Cierra took it up a notch. Awesome meal!"}
{"text":"We went to Pappadeaux's for the first time tonight and it was seriously amazing. My wife and I started with the Oysters Pappadeaux they were very good. It was our first time trying any kind of baked oyster, we like the raw ones better for sure. We also had the greek salad with lump crab. Oh wow that was good. My wife had the Halibut Picata for dinner and I had the Snapper with Live Maine Lobster. The fish was cooked perfectly and the respective sauces were rich and citrusy balanced to perfection. The sides were great as well. For dessert we had the Strawberry Cheesecake and the Carrot Cake Cheesecake. Both were very good.
The staff was freindly and engaging. Our waitress was very helpful and knew alot about the menu. We always ask our first time at a new place and she was very very good. This place is all class, the food is delicous and the staff is fantastic. I highly reccomend this place when you're in the mood for seafood."}
{"text":"Good was great as usual but I Was very disappointed in the service this time.  Took a very long time to receive out me main course. The server also didn't keep up in clearing our table from appetizers and bread to drink refills."}
{"text":"I absolutely looooove Pappadeaux! I haven't had pappadeaux since 2011.  I would come all the way back to Phoenix just to get a taste. My mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We are a party of 4. The restaurant was half empty. We were told wait time 15 minutes! Almost felt like they didn't want our business. I saw too many employees either standing around doing nothing or running around looking like their heads were cut off. This place very disorganized. 
They were out of too many items to boot! The food very salty and overpriced. The plates, too big for  small table for a party of 4. Come on people, this is a sit-down restaurant. I could make better food at home and be comfortable!To top it off we were overcharged for an item that was not ordered. Always check your itemized receipt!
This place is a disappointment. Very embarrassing for what was supposed to be a special night for taking the in-laws out for dinner."}
{"text":"Shrimp po-boy all the way!  The bisque is good too!  I love this place. 1/6/15

Back again!  Still great!  1/31/16"}
{"text":"To be truly honest, I would have to say good old Pappas has had a slight decline in service and food quality since its initial opening. This is especially apparent during its busy times, which is practically every lunch, evening and weekends. The wait time is ridiculous during these meal rushes. 

The last two times that I was there in mid May and just a few weeks ago, my dinner companions and I haven't been able to sit in the normal dining area due to the millions of people already waiting before us. Now don't get me wrong, the patio and bar area are comfortable but sometimes you just want to sit at a normal table. I would definitely suggest trying to avoid the lunch and dinner crowds, by either showing up once they open their doors or maybe and hour or two before they close them, just about any other time outside of that its going to be a mad house in this place. Another thing about seating, on occasion the host or hostess will try to seat you at a back table next to the restrooms. If you're uncomfortable with that (being a 'germ-phobic' person or just don't like the close proximity of the restroom and its visitors) you can ask for another table, they may shoot you a dirty look, but they'll reseat you elsewhere. 

Now to talk about the food. I haven't strayed from my usual dishes all that much, but they're are quite a few for them to be usuals. I would have to say, I'm quite a fan of the hot and fresh bread (on some days it is) and a bowl of their Crawfish bisque. Another favorite of mines is the Salmon Salad, sometimes they under cook the salmon despite how I tell the waiter/waitress for them to have the chef cook it throughly. Other days I'm quite keen on the Po'boys, I jump between a catfish and shrimp combo and an oyster and shrimp combo. Here as well, I tell the waite/waitress that I'd like my oysters fried \"hard\" (if I wanted them soupy, I would have ordered them right out the half shell) to avoid a soggy Po'boy and I'd have to say 5/10 times they actually did listen and the oysters didn't soggy up the sandwich. 

I have a knack of making the appetizers meals. One of my new usuals has been the fried alligator and I would have to say, it is pretty good, but I don't like how they go skimpy on the shoe string fries. Those things are too good to hold back on! Before the alligator came along, I use to order the fried crawfish appetizer, which is about the only dish there besides some of the desserts that I have nothing to complain about it. 

And oh my if you think the dessert tray looks good, it tastes even better. I have had everything on there that doesn't have chocolate in it or on it. The sweet potato pecan pie, I must say is one of my favorites, the creme brulee, for the few times I have had it, is scrumptious, and I love Nila Waffers, so the banana pudding is pretty yummy if you like bananas and pudding. 

So, if you catch Pappas on a good day and time, I would say you're looking at a 5-star rated dining experience. But if its busy, crowded and the kitchen and staff are overwhelmed you may be looking at a 3.5 or a 4."}
{"text":"A long wait but the gator and frog wernt too bad!"}
{"text":"Great place for a New Orleans style feast.  The restaurant is easy to get to; in a great location; beautiful patio; and has a great atmosphere. I went on a Tuesday night at 7:30pm and there was no waiting.  The service was great and the food was excellent.  I ordered the blackened catfish covered with shrimp and crab in a cream/creole sauce.  It could have been a bit more blackened and spicy.  The house salad was good and the gumbo was excellent...just spicy enough for a good kick.  They serve a full loaf of French bread with warm, whipped butter.  There could have been more beer selections.  I may go every night while I'm in town here for 3 days.  MMMMMmmmmm.....GOOD!!"}
{"text":"I don't think I will be visiting this restaurant anymore.  This past Thursday my second time visiting this location the 1st was in may of 2013 both times I was very disappointed in the service from the staff.  

In May 2013 my family and I decided we wanted to have our monthly family dinner at the restaurant and my mother called to see if she could schedule a reservations since it would be about 12 of us on a Friday night,  she was told no and that we would have to come in and wait to be seated.  We came and of course it was busy,  we expected a 30-60 minute wait but after 90 minutes and seeing so many people be seated before us we go back to the hostess and she assures us that there is no table to accommodate us yet but she can sit us in an area that we will be close to each other.  With grumbling stomachs we agree.  When we are seated we are light years away from each other and there is no way for us to communicate with one another.  My mother brings it to the attention of the manager and he was able to fix the problem immediately and for her troubles comped one of the 4 meals she had on her ticket.  I had the blackened Mahi Mahi that night and it was absolutely amazing! 

Fast forward to this past Thursday,  I took my mother for her birthday and it was an utter disappointment. I had Mahi Mahi with Alexander sauce and dirty rice.  My mother had the etoufee.  My fish was great but the rice was very undercooked and hard when I brought it to the attention of the manager and asked for a better cooked serving he said he would see what he could do but it may come from the same batch, which only tells me that he was planning on giving more guest that terribly hard rice.  My mother's etoufee was extremely greasy when brought to the servers attention he tried to say that's the way it's supposed to be but my mom is a regular there she knows what is supposed to taste like.  I was brought a fresh batch of rice that was delicious and my mother was able to order a new meal which she had to get to go because the grease from the etoufee upset her stomach and killed her appetite.  The server I wish I had his name was inattentive,  hardly checked up on us and was a bit rude after we complained about the food.  I thanked him twice and both times he looked with no response.  If I'm gonna spend $70 on a dinner for 2 I expect a friendly accommodating staff I get better service at my local burger King."}
{"text":"Whatever the crawfish thing is I get every time I go there is, it's so freekin good.  

I like sitting in the bar better than in the actual restaurant part where the tables are crammed in and there's probably kids running around them.  

A little too commercial feeling for me to give it 4 stars, but I'll still go there for some dang good crawfish."}
{"text":"After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappa's. So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE! I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint! Perfectly grilled scallops, 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails, 4 huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95! 

I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank! 

Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place ever since i discovered it when I was in Dallas on business.  I was extremely excited when I found out they were opening a location here.  I like seafood to begin with and when you add some Cajun spices, it's even better.  The servers are always so nice here.  This time our server was Olivia and she was great.  We started out with the wedge salad and for dinner we shared the Pappadeaux platter and a baked potato each.  So much food, if you ever walk away hungry, then you need help ... LOL.  The place is always packed but clean."}
{"text":"Service was really good - very experienced server who knew her stuff.  
Food on the other hand was a bit lacking.  I had an oyster poboy and with 6 or so small oysters spread out over an entire bagette it was really unimpressive.  I tore the bread in half and piled all the oysters on one half and that was a bit more like it.  My husband had the crawfish etouffe (his go to) and he said it was pretty standard.  Not a bad meal but I remember when Pappadeaux used to be really excellent."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. It's been a year since last time I dined here and we sat in the main dinning room vs the outside patio. This area is large and overly noisy and it's difficult to even communicate here.

For dinner I ordered the Pasta Mardi Gras Linguine tossed with crawfish, andouille sausage & crimini mushrooms in a marinara cream sauce topped with jumbo grilled shrimp. The dish was tasty and the seafood was fresh except for the crawfish which was out of season. The pasta was not temperature hot - I think the noodles were cold and that made the dish lukewarm. The other entree we tried was Seafood Platter - Fried tilapia fillet, shrimp, blue crab cake, stuffed shrimp & stuffed crab and french fries. This was just eh! There was much filler on the stuffed items and I thought was pricey for what we received. Favorite item was the tilapia. For dessert we split the mint chocolate chip cheesecake which was yummy.

Our waiter was the best - very attentive to details constantly checked in with our needs and handled every request immediately. He was formerly employed at Pappadeaux in Houston but this gent could work at any dinning establishment."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  Our server, Taylor M, was AMAZING.  She was super attentive to our needs and provided a wonderful dining experience.  We started with the Oysters Pappadeauxs. AMAZING!  The catfish and redfish were great choices.  We finished off with Key lime pie & crème brulee. We always have to drive a distance to eat here.  I can honestly say I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't get over to the Phoenix area all that often but when I do this is one place i make a point to visit.  I either get my Pappadeaux fix here or i've got to go to God's Country (Texas).  I always enjoy the food and this time was no different, service is really good.  Vibrant noise level."}
{"text":"Worst experience !!! My server Erin was awesome! My food was delicious! But, yes and there is a but, there was a family with a screaming 4-6 year old girl ( at the top of her lungs, the sound that hits the nerves in your back) she was at the lobster tank and her father was teasing her with the lobsters and taking pictures and no server or manager did a thing about it. So I complained and the manager did nothing and her excuse for doing nothing was lame! Manager, Kathy Belford, her excuse was this is a family restaurant . Like it's a Pieter piper pizza, which I would expect at Peter piper pizza. I spent with tip, $145.47....... Papadeaux thanks for the wonderful entertainment not I'm never coming back!!! Kathy Belford, you must be a millennial!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant in Phoenix twice now. Last night, a Saturday night, was incredibly busy and as many others have mentioned, it is extremely loud! We were a party of four and could almost not even communicate with each other."}
{"text":"Bring more Pappas restaurants here! Being displaced Houstonians (where Pappa's corporate office is based), we were so happy to see that our new home had a Pappadeaux within driving distance. The food is not as good as it is back home, but much better than anything else Phoenix has to offer. I love it all. The flavored teas/lemonades, sourdough bread, soft butter, seafood, etc."}
{"text":"Always a favorite, the food always is amazing and well prepared. The Tuna was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Bad service, old seafood, crappy drinks. I think that sums it up. Ordered a dry martini. A dirty martini was delivered. When I told our waitress she just looked at me like \"so what?!\" Had to go stand down a bus person to get water. But mostly the shrimp was really old and the fish was old. The dirty rice tasted like chemicals."}
{"text":"I waited for 1 hour for the food I ordered. The lobster and oyster were not that fresh. Gumbo wasn't taste right as well. There was a fly around my table! It is not a good experience. I am disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! Visiting from San Diego and I must say this is one of the best seafood restaurant for the price."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.. any time I have extra cash I spend it right here! the service is amazing and what I love is the fact that I could order a to go order and still get the same amount of food and bread as if I were sitting at the table to dine in. This is something that many restaurants lack! when ordering take out many times they take away a soup or salad... not at this place! The seafood is always fresh and the staff always have a smile!!! I love it here"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times, the first time I went here the service was awesome and so was the food. The second time was great service was great and so was the food. The third time I went here we had a party of about 15 for my mother in laws wedding, we called and made a reservation yet when we got there we still had to wait up front and we stood there for 40 mins! We had made the reservation days earlier. When we went to order they were out of half of the stuff we wanted so I orders the roasted chicken. I was disappointed it was so dry and tasteless. The 4th time was this past Monday, first of all they forgot my food so while everybody with me was eating I was just watching them waiting for my food, I wanted about 15 extra mins, second I was waiting for my server to refill my water almost every time it was gone, and the worst part about all of this.... I got the WORST FOOD POISONING from this place, I had to miss school on Tuesday and I'm missing work today. The only thing I have eatin in the past 32 hours is 3 fruit bars because that's all that my stomach will allow!!! Do not waste you're money at this overrated place, it truly is a waste of money and time, and if you do go here just know that you are taking a chance and you might get food poisoning and honestly I have had it before about twice but this is by far the worst case! DO NOT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Nice ambience, great service, really good seafood, nice portions, I truly enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Unreal how the quality and service isn't what it used to be!  One of our all-time favorite places and we always take our guests here when they're in town. Sad to say, we will be looking for another place now."}
{"text":"3 words: Chilean Sea Bass. I have always loved this place. The atmosphere is Great!  My fiance and I always get the oysters and Alligator. It is a bit pricey, but well worth it. We go every chance we get. Service is ALWAYS on point! Love love love!"}
{"text":"One of the best seafood Cajun restaurants out! The food is always fresh and tons of options. Super friendly staff whose always knowledgeable about the menu and give great recommendations. Wish there was one in California' but when I visit Phoenix for my business trip this is a must go!"}
{"text":"So salty. Their dirty side rice dish made my stomach hurt. :/ service is ok, and ambience is ok.. I live far so I probably won't go back.."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have always enjoyed it. The seafood is excellent, I especially recommend the oyster plate... wow!"}
{"text":"I'm always excited when my boss takes us to Pappadeaux but I'm never really happy with my food. The staff is polite and they handle our large groups real well."}
{"text":"For a while it was average, seemed like fried shrimp and drinks.    I've found some new loves...crab cakes- best around all crab..blackened craw fish bisque.  The red fish was quite large and ooh so tasty....

The dessert tray is always worth sharing a few.

Say hey to Jose my favorites sticker if you need a few oysters."}
{"text":"First time that I try alligator meat and it was actually really good... food is amazing...  deserts really good also.."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a lot and while I've been disappointed with the food a couple of times my experiences have been mostly positive. The service is always pretty good too. We will definitely continue coming here!"}
{"text":"The setting was pretty dark. Open dining so kind of on the louder side of dining. I give the service a B. Menu selection was pretty good. A lot of fried food, and a little expensive."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Black Friday, holy cow!!! This place is sooo yummy!! Everything was fresh and you can totally tell they make everything from scratch. Everything was absolutely delish!!! Definitely recommend this place!!! Waiter was great too!! Great service great food!!! 5 stars all day!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Pappadeaux  I get the item on the Appetizer menu, Large order of Fried Alligator.  I always ask that I get half Fried and half Blackened Cajun.  Take a piece dip it in that AMAZING sauce that it comes with and be prepared to know what HEAVEN IS LIKE!!!  I just LOVE this dish so much that I get it at least once a month if not more. And anytime I go to a Pappadeaux's Resturant I get this dish.  ITS UNBELIEVABLE!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so the wife and i decided to come by for lunch on the day of the Eclipse.....and once again our dining experience was incredible...scallops seared to perfection...Stone IPA in the coldest frosted goblet ever....The wife ordered the crab fingers as usual with Yvette sauce on the side....magnifico....!!!!
Our server Jaclyn was flawless....God bless this woman what a great personality....
Destiny our usual bartender was the floor manager now and they couldn't have made a better decision...thanks for a great time folks...see u next time..."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and staff was very friendly and attentive. We never had empty glasses, food came out hot and fast (but not too fast). It felt pretty cold inside, but I guess that kind of goes with the whole atmosphere of the resturant. Would not hesitate to recommend or return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always delicious sand the staff is so friendly! I always get the Live Maine Lobster and it never disappoints me. I also recommend the blue point oysters"}
{"text":"I have never experienced better service and than I did tonight when we went to dinner. The wait was fairly short, we got drinks at the bar while we waited and the bartender was very friendly and fast! We were seated near the kitchen which was kinda cool because I got to see first hand how well the staff here worked together as one cohesive team. Everyone was helping each other and looking out for one another. Our waitress Hannah was amazing, she was so sweet and so kind and very efficient. We had some appetizers then orders the crusted Atlantic salmon. When we got our meal it was cold. We told our waitress and she immediately apologized and offered to bring us another meal ..... We decided to just get dessert instead. She boxed up our cold meal since they were just going to throw it away. Shortly after the manager came over I think her name was Kaylee she apologized for the situation and offered to comp our dessert. When we got our bill she took care of the whole thing..... We were completely shocked! We left our waitress a nice tip and thanked the manager .... We will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting a long time to eat at Pappadeaux so forgive me if I get carried away. In town for some Harley riders fun so we knew this place was going to get crazy crowded, like Vegas Buffett crowded. So as soon as we arrived on Friday we decided to hit this seafood sanctuary early afternoon. YES best decision EVER. We heard the wait time for the whole weekend ended up being over an hour and a half, not for us, not for the trio that has been waiting on this moment since 2012. After we gave them our phone number so they can text us when our table was ready, we walked around to find a seat to wait and as soon as we sat down DING..... The doorbell to foodie heaven rang, literally a 2 minute wait. Okay so now we're headed to our table and I'm scoping the place out left to right up and down all around, this place is HUGE. Fun decorations, big window to see the chefs in action, lobsters in tank, dessert trays, bar popping, patio popping, plates piled with fish, waiters trying to keep a fast pace through the crowd, and lots of happy people. The drinks are fruity and strong, bread n butter on point. Their menu is extensive so it took us awhile to order. I ended up with the seafood platter, hubby had catfish fillets, my ride or die girl had the salmon. People talk about how pricey this place is BUT the portion  and the freshness of the seafood was stellar. We all had enough food left over for another meal. The lump crab cake is just that lump crab delicious. Stuffed crab was perfection. Fish was fried just right and the dirty rice was excellent. I can't wait to return next year same time same place, we will be there because I was checking out the king crab legs and they are now on my radar."}
{"text":"I try to get to Pappadeaux at least 3 times per month.  This time I ordered catfish and grits it did not disappoint. The place was busy (typical) but the service was good and fast. Oh and they have a great happy hour"}
{"text":"I took a very lovely lady here on a whim when our original dinner plans fell through. She had never been here before, I had only been once. It was great. Our waiter was spot on, and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain... but there are some good chains. This is one of those places that has such a gargantuan menu with so much goodness that you want to go back just to try everything that you missed on the first run.  The appetizer offerings had so much I wanted to try, particularly the fried alligator; however, this time we tried the mussels, which were delicious.  I'm pretty picky about mussels, I don't like when they are small and have that graininess when you bite into them.  The mussels at Pappadeaux were fantastic -- large in size, very mild, without any graininess whatsoever.   

I ordered the Big Bay Platter for the main course, which comes with Montage Shrimp (jumbo shrimp stuffed with crab), 3 small Caribbean lobster tails, and grilled shrimp.  The price was reasonable for the amount of seafood, about $25.95 and I was really happy with the dish.  The shrimp montage were delicious, stuffed with generous portion of crab meat; the lobster was pretty good, and the grilled shrimp were basted with a spicy sauce that was very tasty.  This was all served on a bed of dirty rice and green beans.  There is so much more I want to come back and try, like the alligator, and some of the other entrees.  

A few tips:

- Get there early or call ahead to get your name on the list, this place gets packed.

-  be prepared that it's very loud in here, especially when they have the \"New Orleans trio\" band playing.  

- Watch out for the parking lot, it's like a parking lot at the mall on black Friday. You've been warned.

I will definitely return to Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen."}
{"text":"I went to Pappadeaux last night for my Birthday and I have to say it was the worst experience that I have had. Although there was a bright spot and that was our waitress Latica, she was the best part of the evening. We got there and was seated then ordered and it took 55 mins to get our food. Latica kept apologizing for wait and she offered a Salad or Bread. Then when the food came it was one the worst meals that I have had. There was so much water in the plate that the food had no taste. The Shrimp and Scallops were both over cooked. The waitress got the manager to come over and he acted like that he didn't even care. So we told the waitress that we were ready to leave and paid the bill and left. Again the best part of the waitress."}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant and I visited this in Dallas and Phoenix. Awesome seafood and portions are large. for appetizers bisque soup is a good choice. Totally recommend papadeaux specialities. I tried almost all the dishes listed under specialities and you cannot go wrong with them. Highly recommend this restaurant to all sea food lovers."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Texas, exposed to lots of cajun food and now living in LA where there is none, a promised visit to Pappadeaux was what sealed the deal for me to visit Phoenix. 

Pappadeaux did not disappoint - food was just as good as I remembered the chain to be in Texas. I love my crawfish etouffee. And going at lunch (even on the weekends) is definitely the best bang for your buck. They are very, very generous with the portions."}
{"text":"Worth coming in here at least just for the $3.95/dozen oysters! Steal of a deal!

Albeit I came for a late Sunday dinner, I shall count the ways why this place is bomb diggity:

- SUPER warm fresh french bread roll upon being sat
- Did I mention a dozen oysters for $3.95?!
- A bigass piece of delicious tilapia that was still good as a leftover lunch
- Cajun shrimp creole- definitely worth trying
- Excellent service: helpful, informative, efficient, and not overbearing at all

Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Damn this place is definitely a 5 star. The food was so good and the portion was perfect,  I didn't even finish my meal. I ordered the mardi gras pasta which had big shrimps, prawn, sausages and the sauce was amazingly great tasting.  I also ordered the alligator nuggets as an appetizer and I was impressed,  that was the first tyme I tried alligator and maan it was good along with the sauce they give you with it. Our server a young black gurl, very curtious, helpful, knowledgeable, and on point with our drinks never had an empty glass to drink what ever it was. Kudos for the great service and amazing food. I cannot wait to come back n taste all the other food on the menu. It is a lil pricey so bring ur wallet but the portions are good. And the ambiance was cool, nice decos, fairly big establishment,  nice bar, n very very classy. MY NEW SEAFOOD SPOT IN AZ!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Catfish poboy and the father in law had fried oysters and shrimp with a baked potato. Portions are big and the good is outstanding!! Server was Jessica who is more reason to give this place 5 stars! The Mrs. ate before we went and just tagged along...also decided to get the bread pudding and loved every bite. Place is huge and the atmosphere is a lot of fun. We'll be back for that poboy and to see Jessica!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong. Great atmosphere, wonderful food and great service. Really fun outdoor area and a large comfortable indoor space. Food is not overly spicy (which unfortunately seems par for most \"Cajun\" restaurants). 

Very tasty and while not exactly cheap, it's more reasonable than you might expect given the quality and amount of food you get.  Nice bar area too."}
{"text":"can't wait for crawfish seafood ... most of all can't wait till they open one up on the east side ... like gilbert az area ...:)"}
{"text":"Great Environment,  Love the live music.
Great Happy hour.  We came there one night for a workers outting.
Classy yet Relaxing.  A bartender that makes a fine drink and food that is pleasing to the pallet.
Do make sure you budget a decent amount."}
{"text":"This is the  very popular Phoenix location of a restaurant chain, with 32 locations, 23 of them in Texas.

The faire is mostly Cajun, so gulf type seafood dishes, blackened spices, and Texas size portions are in the norm. This location gets jammed packed, and you will wait 45 minutes if you are there after 6:00pm. They do have a number call system. The mains are solid choices with nice side dishes. This is not high brow food, but it is a good meal and a place to go with friends to drink, laugh and yak, as it gets pretty loud at peak times for anything else."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Not very impressed with the menu. Seems like an upscale Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Excellent service! My daughter loves the coconut shrimp. The shrimp fondue was yummy. Alligator was delish ... Drinks complimented it all"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The service is amazing. Place is clean, and beautiful. I love lobster, and this is my place. Manager comes to my table every time with a smile to make sure everything is to perfection,  and they never fail to deliver. Good Job guy, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. I love this place from the building and how the lounge area is set up to the food and service. First they have a fire pit outside with lounge chairs and couches so groups can have a nice relaxing time outside and enjoy. I thought that was really awesome. Second the food was sooooo delicious and it comes in large proportions. I couldn't even finish my food and I'm a good eater. The drinks were the best and reasonable pricing also. The most important part was the service because that was A1. I really couldn't say anything bad about this place and that's why they definitely deserve 5 stars. I will definitely be back there every time I go to Arizona."}
{"text":"Met our daughter to celebrate my wife's birthday. Coming from FH was about an hour and the traffic was congested but we made it on time, 6 PM on a Friday. As we walked to our table, I noticed that this place was packed. 
Our server, Audrey, was right on top of things. She greeted us, asked if this was our first time and told us about the specials. She made us feel like we were invited to her house. 
We started off with a small order of alligator which my wife and daughter have never tried. I told them it was like a very tender chicken nugget. They loved it., especially the bed of fried potatoe shavings.
I loved the lettuce wedge and it's just as large as the one at Cheesecake Factory.
My daughter ordered the Crispy Fried Shrimp. My wife had the Live Maine Lobster and I ordered the Cedar Plank Alaskan Salmon.
The shrimp dish had butterflied shrimp with french fries and the main lobster was enjoyed, but I think I would have preferred the Caribbean lobster because the meat would be much firmer. My salmon was cooked just right, it only came with the asparagus which was nice and plump. I brought half of my dinner home.
We finished off the dinner with a Key Lime pie which was delicious. 
Our server had a keen eye. She automatically assumed that it was a birthday dinner, because she saw my wife reading a birthday card and opening her present from my daughter, and comp'd the desert.
Audrey made our evening enjoyable and when we go back, we'll ask for her."}
{"text":"With all the great reviews and seeing as how crowded it was, I was really sad that my experience wasn't the same.  It's been a long time since I've been to the ones in TX but I certainly don't remember the experience being that bad so maybe it was the timing and the location.  On to my review...

We ordered the fried alligator, Mississippi Catfish Opelousas, and what I think was the Crawfish Etouffee.  The only saving grace was the fried alligator which was very well done.  I always used to get it at a cajun place back home so I was excited to try it here.  This is the one thing that Pappadeaux cooked right.  It was perfectly fried without it being too greasy and the alligator was tender.

The Mississippi Catfish Opelousas on the other hand was awful!  Maybe it was an off day but it wasn't nearly as good as it sounded.  The catfish fillet itself was the worse part.  You know how they usually make catfish nuggets with the stomach of the fish? The not-so-good part of the fish.  Well this fillet tasted worse than that.  The whole fillet was such bad quality that we didn't finish it.  I hate wasting food but I didn't even bother taking it home. It was a really big piece too.  It still leaves a bad taste in my mouth clearly. 

The etouffee was meh.  Not as horrible as the catfish dish but I've certainly had better.  And this is not even including the ones I had in TX and New Orleans.  Didn't bother taking that home either.  And I love leftovers since that means I don't have to cook!

Sigh - overall, I was sorely disappointed especially more so b/c of all the great reviews and how crowded it was.  I'll have to go back again when I am in TX visiting family and see how it compares.

The one nice thing was the live entertainment on the patio area while we waited outside for our table.  The band was good."}
{"text":"This place is the best if your in Phoenix don't miss this place. James our server was the best server I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant in town. The atmosphere was fun and festive and very family oriented. Outdoor seating is available and indoor there is a bar and a huge area for dining. The menu could get a little overwhelming, but our waiter was very sweet and helpful. She suggested we try the baked crab Mac and cheese for our appetizer. Let me tell you, it was very delicious. We also ordered the fried calamari with artichoke hearts, and that too was very tasty. The restaurant was pretty packed/busy for a weeknight but our main entree did not take long. It came at the perfect time after finishing the last bit of our appetizer. I had ordered the Moroccan salmon and shrimp. It was served with couscous, it had the perfect bite to it! Salmon was grilled to perfection, very soft, buttery and moist. Shrimp came with a lump of crab which I did not expect but so good! So much flavor in a dish"}
{"text":"I am not a huge seafood eater yet. Just recently started eating fish, as long as it doesn't have a fishy taste. Well I didn't want to order a 35 dollar plate I didn't like so I got a chicken chopped salad. It was good but I'm always bummed when I get a salad with romaine or iceberg lettuce. I think it's pretty cheap and would much rather eat spinach or kale, leafy greens. The praline cheesecake was so bomb and I couldn't stop eating that. 

The service was pretty good!"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour and enjoyed the fried alligator and great sauce. The shoestring potatoes on the side were crispy. I've been trying to eat healthy when I go out, so based on the description on the menu, I ordered the Greek salad and added crab for an extra $7.99 for my entree. Although it says \"prepared at your table,\" they brought it to me already dressed, the lettuce was literally drowning in the vinaigrette and limp, and there was maybe a tablespoon or two of small pieces of crab on top. The salad had no cucumbers, but had green peppers, which is unusual. A Greek salad always has cucumbers. As I stirred my salad around so I could get a little bit of everything in each bite, the crab basically disappeared and I only saw a couple of Mediterranean olives. The feta was on the light side also. I mentioned to my waiter that my salad was not what I expected and a manager showed up a little while later. I told her my concerns, including paying $8 bucks for the little bit of crab, and very few olives or feta cheese. She told me the salad had 2 ounces of crab and three olives. Excuse me, but if you figure that out, they are charging $64 a pound for crab!! It wasn't even lump crab, and basically disappeared into the salad so I felt like I didn't get any. The green salad was $12.95 and adding the  $7.99, I could've gotten a full entrée for that price ($21). She did offer to bring more olives and feta, which I accepted - however, the $8 worth of crab that I couldn't even taste was my biggest complaint. I was very disappointed in my meal, felt it was overpriced, and was still hungry when we left."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Pappadeauxs. I've been here at least a dozen times and have to say that the food and service is always outstanding. There are so many delicious looking items on the menu that it is tough to decide what to order sometimes. 
     I'm combining experiences here. I recently drove 200 miles round trip to have lunch here. My waitress/bartender Erin was awesome.
     Appetizers... alligator is unbelievable. I always ask for it blackened instead of fried... sooo good. Shrimp and Crawfish fondeaux is sooo good yet so bad if you're on a diet. Don't miss out on the oyster duo.. cooked 2 ways. Mediterranean calamari is great, also crab cakes, oysters on the half shell...you get the point.
     This place feels cajun and gets you in the mood with its ambience. Fresh fish, great food, service and generous portions are what Pappadeauxs is all about. You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"This place is soo delicious, but a little on the pricey side.  The first time I had this absolutely awesome pasta with shrimp and scallops.  It was soo good.  The next time they had taken it off the menu, total bummer. I had lobster tail instead, but it really was rubbery.  The eggrolls are yummy and so is the alligator.  so tender.  and desserts,  oh my.  i for sure recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and everything was amazing. The jumbo shrimp wrapped in bacon over dirty rice was super good. We started with a sampler platter which included the fried alligator it is a must try it was very good. Inside the restaurant was a bit loud but we sat out in the patio which was very nice. We had a great time we will definitely come back again. Our server Christopher B. was on top of everything . All servers should be like him."}
{"text":"Wife found Pappadeaux on Yelp, and boy am I happy she did. We have been watching a lot of Duck Dynasty, and after watching Mrs. K cook up a whole lotta squirrel Brain Jambalaya, my cajun taste buds kicked in. 

we started with the frog legs and lobster egg rolls. The frog legs were incredible, I could not believe how juicy they were. 

For an entre, Tasia got the scallops, and I got the blackened catfish with the dirty rice. I loved this dish, but could barely finish half of it. 

We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"The service sucked!! We had a party of 20 and we didn't get our food till 2 hours later...I got my food 5 minutes after everyone in my party was done!!  Seriously you really need to have a talk with your staff!!!!  i work in a restaurant...serving the customers their food on a timely manner and not forgetting orders is very important!!"}
{"text":"Well - this is finally it, my very first bad review.  So we stopped in for dinner and it was about 5:30.  The hostess was great and made us feel very special, ask if it was our first time there and/or if it was a special occasion.  Once we sat down nothing from anyone.  We waited 15 minutes before just getting up and leaving.  I asked to talk to a manager right before leaving and had to wait a couple of minutes for them to pull her from a meeting (looked like about 8-12 people in a room having a meeting) not sure why at 5:45 (dinner rush they were having a meeting.  The manage apologized and offered to treat us to dinner, I choose not to accept as my time is worth more than a free meal.  I was so upset that because this my buddy from the mid west comes to town often and raves about how good there food is (I was originally from Seattle - looking for good seafood in AZ).  

So with that being said - horrible experience (actually the worst experience I have had so far in Phoenix)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a very long time after several friends claim it's their favorite place.  I arranged for a ladies dinner with a few friends.  Love their reservation process...you get a text confirming and also another one as a reminder the day of.  
We arrived starving!  We were promptly seated and the ordering began.  My meal started with the Lump Crab Artichoke Dip.  It was very delicious.  However, I have to note that it did not taste like it had any crab in it.  No 'lumps' of crab whatsoever, not even a seafood flavor to it.  Still trying to figure that one out.  Did I say anything?  No, because it was a very delicious dip.  But I have to admit that at $17 I was disappointed there clearly was no Crab in it.
After the appetizers we were brought warm bread and butter that was amazing, as well as salads and soups for those that ordered them. 
My entree was the Mahi Alexander, per our server's recommendation.  Wow!  It was delicious.  I ordered the smaller portion and it was more than enough, I ended up with leftovers-yay!  
Our service was great.  We were not offered dessert...just brought our checks (which were wrong and had to be corrected).  If it weren't for those 2 little things I would probably have given 5 stars.  We paid before one in our party realized we weren't offered dessert and she wasn't too happy about it.  I personally was way too stuffed!
For me personally, I am an ambiance girl and I don't feel this is the right ambiance for a date night.  But it also was a little difficult with a large group because it is SO loud.  I would much prefer to sit on the adorable and very NOLA patio.  But being a December night it was much too chilly! I'd like to return in the spring and sit outside where it's quieter.  
All in all, I was pleased and will return."}
{"text":"I know this place is a chain restaurant and I usually avoid those but damn the food is too good to resist. We always receive fabulous service at this location even when the place is packed. Management is good about actually having adequate amounts of servers at all times. We have been here for many lunches and dinners. They are wonderful at either time. The lunch specials do make this place more affordable for all.  Whatever time you come just know it will be worth it."}
{"text":"What a great evening! My husband and I enjoy trying new restaurants (to us) and decided it was time to try Papadeaux's. I'm not going to lie, I was a little apprehensive since I'm not a \"frog leg\" or \"alligator\" type of person and up until this point, that's all I knew of Papadeaux's.  Boy was I wrong! Brenda, our server, was so helpful and suggested different ways we could try our selection of foods. She was on point with checking in at our table to make sure everything was good. Drinks never went empty and the food arrived one right after the other. Our bartender came by our table and it was then we learned he was actually one of the managers. Forrest had heard it was our first visit and wanted to  expressed his gratitude that we chose to visit Papadeaux's and even went out of his way to make sure our first visit was perfect. I've never been so pleased with a restaurant before visiting Papadeaux's so a big thank you to Brenda and Forrest. The drinks were amazing, the food was amazing, the service was amazing, everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food and service will return again Paul was are server great job and excellent service"}
{"text":"I took my son and his girlfriend here one night , it was their first time there.   We were welcomed with smiles, seated and very well taken care of.  There were a couple mishaps, but the server was new, so it was a learning experience.  We each ordered, not knowing how large their plates are.  We ate the appetizer and that was pretty big!  Then the plates came!  They were huge!  We easily got 3 meals out of each one!  I will be going again!"}
{"text":"It was my first time dining here and it was amazing! The wait was about 35 minutes so I recommend calling ahead. I ordered the Caribbean Lobster Tail with Mashed Red Potatoes and Asparagus. It was so good. I highly recommend it. I tried the fried calamari and it was good with the lemon aoli sauce. Our waiter, Jacob, was great! He was funny and really accomodating. Our food and drinks came out in a timely manner. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Always an amazing experience. Have been coming here for years, not one time have they let me down in any way. Great service, great food, great environment. The food is so amazing, it leaves you wanting more even though you cant eat another bite . The shrimp brochette is 5 star deluxe. Hats off to you all that make this dining experience"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and the look of the place. The food is really good but pricey. Great service and always crowded."}
{"text":"Delicious! The only drawback was we were freezing, the air must have been on 50Nick and Christy were awesome! The overall service at the bar area was laid back and on point for a Friday afternoon. The seafood gumbo w/ andouille sausage was sooo good, as well as the fried cat fish, seasoned, fresh and delicious! My husband totally enjoyed the red beans and rice. We will definitely come back again when visiting Phoenix ...we're still disappointed we don't have a Pappadeaux's n Cali!"}
{"text":"If you love seafood this is the place.  Service is amazing, Ryan G provided me and my guest amazing service.  Highly recommend, the menu offers many options.  Love it."}
{"text":"Three of us went here an hour before they closed (9pm) and were seated right away. We ordered the alligator appetizer and a cup of lobster bisque. The alligator with the Cajun sauce was deli-sh! My cup of lobster bisque was creamy with chunks of lobster in it. Probably one of the best that i have had. When ordering our waitress was very helpful, we ordered Costa Rican Mahi Alexander, Crawfish Etouffee, and the Soft Shell Crab. By far HANDS DOWN the Alexander was the best dish. It offered a little bit of everything and the flavor or the sauce plus the amazing dirty rice. OMG it was amazing and i am kind of upset that i wasn't the one who ordered them. The Etouffee was colorful and deli-sh the crawfish were really soft and easy to chewy plus the flavor the sauce thy were in was amazing. I ordered the soft shell crab... i had never had soft shell crab before. It was pretty good! I would recommend that you put a little of the Cajun sauce that was served with the alligator."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to dine in I would recommend this place for any and all occasions.  Food is outstanding and service is great also.  Thanks"}
{"text":"If you like any kind of seafood, this is the place for you! The trio-appetizer is amazing. Crawfish and shrimp fondeux, fried alligator (better than I had in NOLA!) and calamari. Next course was lobster bisque, which is easiest the best I've ever had!! I had the stuffed shrimp for dinner and it was perfect. My boyfriend had the Mardi Gras pasta and the sausage in it was the best thing on the table.

I had the sweet potato pecan pie for dessert and I could eat a whole pie of that! The creme brûlée looked awesome, but no one at the table ordered it. That will be for next time. 

I HIGHLY recommend this place if you're craving creole or seafood...or both!! It is a bit pricey but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"First time here. Our waiter Dustin made it an excellent experience!! The food was amazing , taste just like the food in Louisiana. We are definitely coming back. You have to try the purple voodoo drink"}
{"text":"First time we had ever been to Pappadeaux's.  My husband had the fried platter.  The badder was light and did not weigh you down or over power the food.  I had the Salmon salad.  Best salmon I've ever had!  My mother in law had mauhi over some type of mash.  All the food was fantastic!!  So we shared the bread pudding for dessert.  Best dessert I've ever had!  The server, Joe was also fabulous!  The whole experience is what gives this place 5 stars!  From start to finish, it was amazing!  It's a little higher priced, but definately worth it!  Upscale dining for sure!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Our server was Macy like the store. She came to the table quickly and was very friendly!  She explained everything perfect and I went with the blue point oysters and my date glue the mix grilled seafood. 

The oysters were one ice,  cold and yummy!  

The mixed grilled seafood my date has was enough for two and very delicious.

Definitely a winner for a night out and we will be  back.  Make sure to ask for Macy as your server for a perfect stay to a fun time.   Jim K"}
{"text":"This place rocks with great Cajun food besides San Francisco style seafood dishes. Pleasant atmosphere inside and out! When I have guests from out of town, I like to take them here. Friendly service. 
Just a different experience than most other restaurants because it has a feeling of being outside on a big porch with big picture windows. Close by hotels. All seafood seems pretty fresh considering there's no ocean in Phoenix.

{"text":"My wife and I just returned home from a fantastic evening out.  We went to Pappadeaux's to celebrate our 31st wedding Anniversary.  Our evening started with the Crab Lump Spinach dip appetizer and a Classic Caesar salad split between us.  Then the main course, my wife had the Brazino on the Half Shell and I had the Costa Rican Mahi and Lemon Chile Crab.  We finished then evening with coffee and the Bread Pudding and Bourbon sauce.  To say the food was excellent is an understatement.
Now for an equally if not more important part of the evening, our server.
Victoria, AKA: Tory did an exceptional job.  Her knowledge and explanation of items on the menu, and her personality in general made for an enjoyable evening.  We never wanted for anything!
We won't hesitate to recommend this restaurant and we'll definitely be back.  What a Great Place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Since writing the original review, I have been contacted by the manager of the restaurant. He discussed correcting the problems that I noticed, and sent a card for a free meal. Since I accept no free meals from anyone, I gave the card away to another person who would like to eat there. While I can't give another star without eating there again, the concern of the manager speaks volumes to me. I will be reevaluating this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed eating here. I have heard of this restaurant for years and never come until yesterday. I had heard it can take a while time get seated because it's popular. We were seated right away. 

The restaurant is big and has plenty of seating so I imagine the special occasions and maybe evenings would be the only time you'd have to actually wait to be seated. We came at lunch time on a Saturday and it was fine. 
 
Our waiter was super nice and explained things. He didn't ask us how the food was with our mouths full of food. They give you like a loaf of bread and butter to get things started lol.

I got the pasta Mardi gras and my gf got the shrimp and grits - both were lunch specials. The total was about 42 bucks prior to tip. We didn't get anything but water to drink. So that gives you an idea how much it costs to eat here. 

As far as the food goes I liked both of our meals. I've never really cared for grits but they make theirs different. It has all sorts of flavor mixed in. Portions were good. 

We had some of the praline cheesecake as well - to go, because I was stuffed but the dessert looked legit. It was comped by the manager because it was our first time here :) I'm not sure if I'm to share that, but it was totally a surprise and made a good experience even better. 

The sauce on the cheesecake had a rum flavor to it and it was awesome. It would have been about 7 bucks for a big slice. 

The restaurant itself is cool. I wouldn't say it's super fancy like Flemings where you'll feel weird wearing jeans. So you can come causal or dressed up and you'll be good. 

We'll definitely come back to try some more of the food. We were spying on other people's food and it all looked good."}
{"text":"Been here a few times as it's a nice place to take people after a long day at the office.  Food is good especially for those who like seafood.  I would say get here early...it gets pretty busy when the sun goes down, at least the last couple of times I was there."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for the annual Origami Owl convention.  Pappadeaux is where my team leader chose to have our team dinner. I loved this choice because of the extensive options on the menu. There was so much to choose from that I didn't know where to start! 

I studied the menu the best way I knew how while hungry . I chose a cup of Louisiana  Shrimp Gumbo to start. It wasn't salty like most places it had the right amount of spice to clear your throat. There was also a generous amount of seafood for the size.  I chose the Mississippi Catfish Opelousas for my main dish  after much debate  going on in my head. I usually like my catfish fried but I thought this would be healthier even though it would be sitting on Lemon Garlic Butter sauce. I really can't say, \" No\" to things with lemon garlic butter. I had an issue with eating oysters that night so they simply left them out and added more Shrimp and jumbo crab meat. It was absolutely divine with the dirty rice ! Loved it!! 

I was stuffed but I couldn't turn my back on the Banana Wafer pudding that was served in a cute mason jar! The pudding was nice and thick and not too sweet. It was perfect! I also shared my husband's drink Swamp Thing but it was too strong for me. 

I wish we had one of these restaurants in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The seafood is very fresh, I'm not quite sure how they do that. The crab cakes are to die for. They put crawfish in them and the sauce is d'lish. I love the plank salmon too, but I recently discovered the pasta mardi gras (seafood pasta). I'm usually not a fan of seafood pastas because they taste so fishy, but this was really good. I've never had anything less than great here and each time I go I try something new.

The drinks are good, but the speciality drinks are pretty weak. If you want a good strong drink, order a mixer. On the weekends they usually have live music on the patio, which is usually jazz or blues. It makes waiting for a table all the easier for sure. They do take reservations though, so if you don't want to wait an hour, call ahead.

If you go all out on the meal (appetizer, drinks, and dessert), for two people, you can expect it will easily be over $100. Worth it! Though we usually save it for special occasions."}
{"text":"This is one of my top 5 favorites in the US. Great sea food. If you come before 6 usually can get in quick.  The salmon topped with one of their sauces is the best you have ever had.  This location in Phoenix is equal to their Huston locations. 2 can share any meal and be full."}
{"text":"Treated my friend's family here recently, on a busy Sunday night.  We have been here several times now, but I do not remember the food taking this long.

We had reservations for a party of 7 at 6:30pm, we showed up early at 6:15pm  but we still had to wait till about 6:50pm to be seated.  It was extremely busy.

Food took awhile but it was worth it.  Our server was pretty nice and overall we had a good experience."}
{"text":"Wow! Went here after my graduation from NCU. It did not disappoint. Food was on point through and through.

Food quality:10
Food:10

What can I say. I wanted a adjustment to a dish; done no problem. I don't have a bad thing to say.

Had alligator for appetizer: cooked to perfection seasoning, dipping sauce all on point. Crispy not chewy. 

I had the Mardi Gras's pasta with scallops vs. crawfish. Excellent. My family was pleased with their meals as well. Their meals looked good and smelled good too!
I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I never tasted alligator until my bf took me here, it's very good. 
We've tried a few different plates here and love them all. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once but the 2nd time around and oh man its way better. I recommend the jumbo shrimp brochette. Basically jumbo shrimp wrapped in bacon with pepper jack cheese and a slice of jalapeño. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"2 favorite dishes are Costa Rica Talapia with spaghetti squash  or blackened Costa Rican mahi with cream cheese grits. 

Came here again yesterday with my family and since my son is sensitive to many things the manager came out and asked us exactly what he was allergic to in order to make something custom just for my son.  He was so accommodating that I just had to write another review on it.  I had to order my usual Talapia and it was fantastic as well.  I also did not know that they ship in new seafood daily and everything here is homemade, which is probably why this place is full of awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Best seafood you will ever eat! Everything taste fresh and delicious. I ordered the Wild King Alaskan Salmon and the waiter said they were a little disappointed with the presentation of my plate because it broke in half during the plating process. (even though I couldn't tell) he said they were gonna bring me another piece to make up for it. I thought it was just going to be a piece but to my surprise they brought me a new Wild King Alaskan Salmon! If that's not customer service then I don't know what is! The staff does a fine job of keeping your glasses full and keeping your table just happy to be there at the restaurant. I would recommend this place to anyone.... And yes it is 100x better than Red Lobster! you have to try the fried Alligator! it takes a bit like chicken but with it's own distinct flavor."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Staff was fantastic! Had a good time @ happy hour....we will be back"}
{"text":"This 2 stars is extremely generous. Wanna know why? Read on.

My party of 7 and a baby got to Pappadeux's around 6:30. We were told that it would be a 30-minute wait. It ended up being more than an hour. We were standing right in front of the hostess station, yet no one ever came to give us updates on how long it would be for our table. We would go check about every 20 or so minutes. One time we were told that our table was ready. When we went to check on it after about 20 minutes we were told that they were waiting on a busboy to clean it. A few minutes later they were still waiting on a busboy. In what universe does it take a restaurant 30 minutes to find a busboy to clean a table? We watched group after group after group get seated. A group of 7 that came after us was seated before us. We ended up being sat next to them; by the time we were getting our menus, they were finishing up their meals.

Once we were finally seated, we waited almost 10 minutes before someone came to our table to introduce himself as our waiter. When he asked how we were doing, we kindly told him that we were a little frustrated because it had taken more than twice as long as we were told, and we had been told twice that they were waiting on a busboy to clean the table. The waiter said that it was a busy night and said that he didn't get paid to deal with unhappy customers. He asked, \"So are you gonna do this or what?\" WHAT?! It was so rude - I don't know how he meant it, but it came across as sounding extremely annoyed. We were appalled and my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager.

The manager came over and spoke with my boyfriend. Not sure what was said, but after that things got much better. The manager brought us an appetizer plate on the house. Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator. I got shrimp etoufee, and it was great. The gumbo wasn't so fabulous. Overall, everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got three different drinks, and they basically tasted the same: like cherry Nyquil.

The food was good, but it's not always about the food. The service was horrible. Don't think I'd ever go there again. There are too many other places with great food and equally great service."}
{"text":"This was an excellent experience all around. The service was fantastic and the food amazing.  I had the fried oysters and they were spot on.  This girl from the South thanks you!  We will be back SOON!
Don't miss this one!"}
{"text":"This place is so worth the wait! My brother, bff and I came on Valentine's Day 2015. There was an 90-120 minute wait and no reservations, but that was okay. A bar server named Justin came around to take drink orders outside and was extremely prompt and courteous. Once inside, our server Nora was nothing but friendly and professional. Even though the restaurant was slammed, she treated us as if we were the only diners here. Extremely attentive and lovely. The food was exquisite and the drinks were fabulous! We cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"So I was an idiot and thought gumbo was jambalaya...  I set myself up for disappointment when I received a bowl of soup. BUT WOW it was so jam packed full of flavor. I don't think I've ever eaten real crab either. It's always been that fake imitation type. And the shrimps!! Mmm I love shrimps. 

I'm sad I'm leaving Phoenix today. I won't get to try the other seafood items, but just from this bowl of gumbo I can tell the other food must be bomb."}
{"text":"Food was good, but a little overpriced.  Drinks were good.  Food was cooked perfect, lobster and filet mignon with asparagus was done to perfection, I had the catfish, it's not my favorite.  Very crowded and little bit of a wait.  Service was good, we got everything we needed right away.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I came was not happy with a food item I received nut  Lisa made me so happy that I will return . She provided me with another dish and I was happy. Jackie was my waiter and not one time did she get frustrated.  Love this place.  Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"I was looking for a location to host a party of 50 for a business function and this was perfect. The service was top notch, food delicious and atmosphere exactly what I wanted. I love their outdoor garden so I had our event on the patio. I had the salmon that melts in your mouth and my husband had the shrimp wrapped in bacon. They should rename it \" heaven shrimp \""}
{"text":"While on an overnight trip to Phoenix we decided to try Pappadeaux for dinner.  It was a fabulous decision.  We got a very friendly greeting when we entered.  We were taken to a table right away.  Once seated it was only a few moments when Chris, our waiter, came by to see if we wanted a drink before dinner.  Shortly after they came by with warm bread & butter.  I decided to order an appetizer and enjoy some raw oysters on the half shell.  They offer more than the usual horse radish & cocktail sauce.  I enjoyed them very much.  My dinner included soup or salad so I chose to try the clam chowder.  It was very good.  A bit different than what I was use to but most enjoyable.  For entrée's my wife opted for the halibut and I decided on the trout & shrimp combo.  Both were great.  When we had finished our entrée's Chris came by with a dessert tray that included some very tempting items.  He told us there was one item available not on the tray.  It was a multilayer cake which we chose.  It was fabulous.  While enjoying our dessert the manager stopped by our table.  We learned later they comped our appetizer & dessert since it was our first time there.  While it was very much appreciated we sure didn't expect it.  The service and food was excellent.  Yes we recommend Pappadeaux and are looking forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"I got the Caribbean lobster tail and filet mignon and it was my first time trying lobster, that why I figured if I didn't care for the lobster I'd eat the filet. Well the lobster was amazing, so delicious. They filet actually needed more seasoning, so I was glad that I did like the lobster- which I should it's a $50 plate. But it was well worth it. I also got the purple voodoo and that drink was very good too. Can't wait to come back and have the lobster again."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. It's a great family restaurant with exceptionally fresh seafood. We look forward to always eating here. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star, which for the service and the food it deserves a 5 star. Is that we wait a long time to get in. We always wait 40 minutes or so for dinner. Other than that we love coming here. Their oysters are so darn good and their grilled fish are so delicious and fresh and everything you order is great."}
{"text":"Love love love!!! This place was so amazing, I've heard many things about it, so given the fact I would be in the area to try it I just had to. I'm so glad I did my food was excellent and my drink was very good as well, I had the swamp thing not to mention it was quite strong compared to other place that give watered down drinks. I will definitely be returning in the near future"}
{"text":"Oh, where to begin..

I stopped by Pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a Wed, they told me it was a 45min wait for two.. wow.  The place was packed.   The hostess recommended we make a reservation for the weekend, so we made one for Friday at 7PM.

The smells coming from the place when you first pull in automatically keep you wondering what delicious things are waiting inside.  

I'm so glad we did. 

We showed up and they gave us a card with a number and once our number showed up on the screen, it was seating time.  I think we waited maybe ten minutes.

After gazing over the menu for a quick minute, we decided to try the fried alligator with creole sauce.  Being one to enjoy new things, I was pretty excited.  The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer.  The place at this point was insanely packed, but it was nice to see a place like this.  Made ya feel that something good was to come.  Heck, a place cant' suck if it's this packed, right?   So we order our food, I decided on the stuffed shrimp and the rest of my friends all ordered different things.  It would be a share-a-meal night.. 

About 10min into drinks and conversation, they bring out the fried alligator..  Ok, if you've never eaten anything weird before.  Please please.. you've got to try this.  It sorta reminded me of a cross between soft pork or chicken.  The taste literally melted in my mouth.  To top it off, the creole sauce that went with it, only complimented it.  I could easily have eaten the entire plate alone.  Sadly, I had to share..

After quickly destroying the fried alligator, we got our entrees.  I took one bite and had to pause a moment.. the taste of the stuff shrimp with the crab, Alfredo, spices inside just floored me.  There were only six pieces, but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans, this was plenty of food. 

I can't wait for my next trip here.. fantastic food."}
{"text":"The best as always.  It was my girlfriends birthday and we invited my parents and we had the best dinner ever. Our waitress  Esther gave us 1st class service and the food was succulent. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Excellent if you like butter + fried foods. I'm not a huge fan so got the crudo which looked amazing when it came out (and it wasn't bad at all). Ten stars for Dominic the really tall server -- SUPER nice and friendly and helpful and kind. I dunno, maybe I'm spoiled with Bay Area food, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend the place to friends. Interested to try Cleo's next time. http://www.yelp.com/biz/little-cleos-seafood-legend-phoenix"}
{"text":"Really really good food. the food was one of a kind and I can't even begin to describe how good the The bread pudding was. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"The frog legs and oysters are amazing. Came for a birthday was told I would get a free dessert and didn't see waitress for 45 minutes. The bill was over 200$ ....might come back still deciding if it's THAT good"}
{"text":"Went here for a holiday dinner. Food was good, service good, all was good. Unique seafood offerings for sure."}
{"text":"For all the money and hype, this seafood restaurant is not all it's cracked up to be. The food was under seasoned and lacking. I was so excited to eat go eat there again only to be let down. I've been there many years ago and remember enjoying whatever seafood pasta dish I had ordered.  But this recent visit left me wanting more and unfortunately it wasn't more food from them."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Never had a bad meal here.  Service is exceptionally good.  Love their oysters... the complimentary bread and especially the restaurant made butter are also to die for.  Recommend making reservation on the weekend to avoid long wait time but you can go to the bar and grab a beer or glass of wine while waiting for your table."}
{"text":"Very impressive!!! The place looks classy very romantic atmosphere... On a friday night (we arrived at approximately 8:40) at which point they  said the wait time would be about an hour. We sat outside enjoyed the live music & within 20 minutes... BAAAMMN we were seated! Our server NATHAN was oh so helpful in recommending food as this was our 1st time. Everything was delicious & well portions were filling no room for desert :'(

A bit pricey but great place to take a date or celebrate something! Will definitely come back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I love their greek salad! Recently took my aunt for her bday and she thoroughly enjoyed it! Great place for bday lunches n dinners!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Pappadeaux for a special occasion.  I think the seafood salad is amazing.  I had the creme brulee for desert.  The coffee the ambiance is so nice and the wait staff are wonderful.  It is not everyday type fare for me, due to the fact it can be pricey.  Everyday is usually packing my own lunch.  I would recommend this venue for \"power lunches\" and meetings with others.  Just walking in the door improves my mood.  For a date I would say, stop in for an appetizer and a glass of wine.  Excellent food."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE! My dad had been to their locations in Texas and highly recommended we go out of the way to try this place. So glad we did. EVERYTHING we had was to die for. Even the bread. So I imagine you can't go wrong with anything here. I had the sirloin and was blown away. And the bread pudding... Again, incredible!"}
{"text":"When I found out there was a Pappadeaux in Phoenix, I wanted to treat my girlfriend for something different since she's never tried Pappadeaux or Cajun style food.  Atmosphere was great, but it was a tad bit chilly inside (had to grab my coat from the car).  The oysters and cocktail shrimps were nice and plump not the miniature sized ones you would find in other chain seafood restaurants.  I ordered the deep fried soft shell crab and it was amazing as usual and my gf ordered the mahi mahi with the cheese grits and green beans.  One thing that my gf complained was that the menu did not have indications of the food being spicy.  Her grits were a little bit spicy.  But I told her it's kind of inferred since it is Cajun style.  Other than that, food was fantastic.  And would definitely try it if you're in the PHX area."}
{"text":"Second time here and not a bit disappointed. Seafood selection is amazing. Alligator and Steak for the non-seafood individuals. All in all this restaurant is a 10. Don't be deceived by the parking lot, this place is huge and has a great sized bar. Christy was our server and was absolutely phenomenal. Definitely a pleasure to have been served by Christy. She was quick, knew the menu inside and out and is a true asset to this establishment. 

Apps and drinks were served promptly and dinner was amazing. Caribbean lobster was huge and cooked perfectly. The ettouffe  was to die for.. .. Just as if we were back in New Orleans.. Great flash back and desserts topped off the meal. Love-love-love this place."}
{"text":"Papadeux is a treat when in the Phoenix area. The place is always crowded but the wait isn't always very long. Best Cajun food I have ever had outside of Orleans and service is very attentive. If your looking for a steak this place isn't the place, they have steak but the seafood or chicken is where it's at."}
{"text":"Great food! Go here on special occasions as it is a bit expensive but worth every penny. Servers are friendly and well rehearsed on the menu."}
{"text":"Did the happy hour here a few times, food is okay nothing to really brag about and it's expensive to boot. Atmosphere is friendly but not too over the top for the prices they charge. The fish is fresh but the wait was too long especially with two kids in tow. We've gone a few times but just can't seem to get the full satisfaction of good food, good environment and good ole customer service!"}
{"text":"What a great lunch. Service here was impeccable. Our server, Ariel was very attentive, super polite and such a sincere, friendly smile! It was two of us and we ordered an appetizer, entrees and was sure to stop early so we could have dessert. Ariel even put our leftovers in a container with ice since we were going to a movie afterward. Very nicely done all around. Oh yeah, the food. Wonderful. Flavors that explode. Carefully devised recipes that resulted in truly satisfying mouthfuls bite after bite. Well done. Slow clap. Where's my pillow?"}
{"text":"We came and they were out of crawfish on the last day, but it's okay I'm not mad. However, another customer and I did agree at they need bigger TV screens."}
{"text":"I am 21 and the Manager wouldn't serve me any alcohol because my drivers license were from Utah , the manager said that my drivers license were tampered all because a had a little piece of tape on the bottom where the address was to show my address has changed which at the DMV in Utah said that was okay to do that rather paying 20 dollars for a new drivers license. After the manger told me That they wouldn't serve me she began with sarcastic comments which was really rude. Probably won't come back again. Don't recommend for people who are visiting from other locations with a changed address."}
{"text":"Date night success! The fried alligator and calamari appetizer was so good- my boyfriend and I inhaled it. I had the seafood platter dinner which was a ton of food- I had a lot of leftovers to take home. Very good, fresh tasting seafood. Only downside was there was a wait to be seated but no worries."}
{"text":"Setting:  Dimly lit, nice for dates.  Very clean.  There is another room for bigger parties.  Nice bar for just to hang out and watch a game.

Food:  Yum!!!  Had the steamed Maine lobster.  For less than $20 it was very very good!  Meaty too.  They give you the whole lobster, complete with thick juicy claws.  Oh, and the Greek salad was very very good as well.  Highly recommended for big groups.  Finally, the fondeaux is also very tasty.  Although it's a bit think on the cheese.  But hey, if you like cheese, this is the appetizer for ya.

Service:  Awesome folks, we had a cool waitress.  So sorry we made you take pictures of us and you almost fell off the table!  :(  But she was a great sport.  Very helpful, very nice."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant!!! Excellent food and excellent service!!! A bit pricey but worth it!!"}
{"text":"Loved everything! We ate there because my Mother-in-Law got a tip from her friend that they had an Oyster deal that couldn't be beat! Dad hadn't had Oysters on the half shell in many years.
The place is very large, dimly lit and was busy busy busy! But I think they have a lot of experience with handling the crowds. I would have preferred a quieter restaurant, but the food quality was worth the inconvenience of barely being able to carry on a conversation without yelling. We had appetizers (alligator was good!) and a good meal  -Costa Rican Tilapia LaFayette. OH man! the food was excellent. I would definitely go again in spite of the noise and crowd... I understand why the crowd!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times and have always been pleased with the quality of our meals.  It's hard to find fresh seafood in Phoenix and this place has delivered time and again. We always go during their happy hour which is from 3-6 M-F in their bar area which includes seats at the HUGE bar top and a few booths.  Not sure if HH is available on the patio... Compared to their normal menu prices ($$$) their HH pricing is fantastic.  And if you have a hankering for oysters this is the place to go.  Last time we went we got a dozen  of delicious Gulf Coast oysters for $7.95. They have several other HH food items in the $4-$7 price range ( calamari, catfish poboys, steamed cajun shrimp served with sausage and corn on the cob) but our favorite by far is the alligator.  They typically serve it fried but on our first visit our server recommended trying it blackened. We went with her suggestion and were not disappointed. It is served with a rich, brown sauces that is is on it's own fantastic. The drink prices on their HH are decent as well.  I usually go with their specialty cocktail \"The Swampthing\" It's a deceptively strong, frozen drink that I highly suggest. Get the large, it comes in an icy goblet that will keep your drink nice and cold as you enjoy your meal. They also have a good draft beer selection if that is more your thing.  The bill between the two of us is usually around $50 for a few  apps, a couple drinks a piece and a dozen oysters. They will also provide you with some fresh baked bread.

The regular menu is rather large and features a variety of seafood.  You have quite the selection to choose from including alaskan king crab legs, live maine lobster  and all sorts of fish.  I think I saw a scallop dish or two on there as well.  They also have several \"combination\" platters that feature fried shrimp, fish, stuffed shrimp, stuffed crab, etc. My husband once ordered a cajun tilapia (mahi perhaps?) with scallops dish that he loved off their \"Specialty Menu\". I can suggest the live lobster as well.  On one visit I saw the lobster tank and couldn't help myself. They actually had an 8 lb lobster in there! He proudly carried the title \"KIng of the Tank\" He was $159 and probably would have been worth every cent but I opted for one of the smaller guys.  I was not disappointed.  Mr Delicious was served with drawn butter and a side of pasta (linguine with diablo sauce I believe) and I have actually gone back and ordered just the side of pasta it was so good! 

The restaurant itself is rather large but it is always busy so get there early or at least call ahead.  Especially if you have a larger group."}
{"text":"I come here about 3-4 times a year for one thing, their Pasta Mardi Gras. In my opinion, it's a much shorter drive than the gulf shores to get authentic tasting seafood heaven. And I never miss on the Crispy Fried Alligator appetizer."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in Phoenix AZ!! Love this place  great food & service every time! My absolute favorite is their fried calamari with aioli dipping sauce. YUM! My hubby loves the shrimp and crawfish fondeux, but honestly you will not be disappointed with anything so go ahead and step outside your comfort zone and order something different- the food is excellent in every way!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times and are amazed every time! Not only is the food out standing, but service exceeds any normal expectation. The \"Oysters Pappadeaux\" makes my mouth water just thinking of them! 
I was there today with a party of nine today and the service was outstanding and the food met everyone's  expectations! I will a regular!!"}
{"text":"Pappadeaux and I have a history.  We're both from Houston.  At home, I've been to just about every Pappas restaurant there is many times.  The Pappas family is an integral part of the Houston restaurant scene, love them or hate them.  (Most people love them.)  And in good old H-Town, they have a longstanding informal rivalry with the Goode family, who are like the working man's Pappas family, maintaining similar but less pricey/fancy restaurants.  At home, given a choice between Pappadeaux and Goode Co. Seafood, I will always choose Goode Co., because that's how my family rolls.  But when you take Pappadeaux out of that context, you must acknowledge that it is really a great restaurant.

This place is a carbon copy of the original, down to the plants on the patio.  I'm fine with that.  Why fix it if it ain't broke?  As far as I can tell, the food is carbon copy too.  And I'm fine with that, too!  It's pretty darn good food, and it's an accurate representation of the kind of food that our part of the world loves best.  You've got your Cajun, you've got your Creole.  You've got your fried fish (yummmm) and you've got your grilled fish (yummm!!!).  Their po-boy is not too terrible at all, considering how removed it is from its original context!  As a matter of fact, it was downright tasty!  I much prefer flounder to catfish, but hey, I'll live.
The original down-home dishes are what Pappadeaux does best, and I am always weirded out to see it advertising itself as some kind of fusion restaurant or lobster buffet.  Sushi?  Seriously?  Come on guys!  You don't need a gimmick!  This isn't a Landry's!

If I had to pick favorite dishes, I'd go with anything mesquite grilled, their fried shrimp, and their crawfish bisque, just because I love bisque (although Pappadeaux does not, I should add, have the best in the world).  The service is always good, although I miss the witty signage that all Pappadeuxs have in Houston.  AH WELL.  I enjoy their atmosphere because it is like so many other seafood restaurants on the Gulf Coast, where I half-expect to see a picture of my grandfather's boat on the wall.  

I haven't had much of what Phoenix has to offer in the seafood department, but I'm willing to bet, based purely on my Houstonian hubris, that this Texas import is one of the best in town.  Now if only we could get Goode Co. out here..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a higher review because I love the food here but the last several times my husband and me have came here we have been mis-quoted how long of a wait it would be and not by a little bit. We were quoted 45 mins it's now almost two hours in we wish we would have gone somewhere else but now we will be waiting no matter where we go! Don't come here hungry you will starve before you get your food!**update, we mentioned our wait to wait staff which let the manager know and they quickly handled the situation in a wonderful way! We will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"For healthier items, eat from the \"naked fish\" menu; that's what I did. The meal started with a crispy Cesar salad, which was very traditional, and if you love this kind of salad this will do the trick. 

My main course was the 11oz Costa Rican Tilapia, which was served with a green bean potato medley. Fresh fish, cooked right, no complaints. 

I want to come back on a cheat day and get on down with some of their fried foods, and tempting desserts. This is a beautiful restaurant on the inside and out. Bring a date, have some wine, eat some oysters, get all hot & randy, then go home and make sa-weet love to each other."}
{"text":"First time dining here....extremely disappointed. We dined for my girlfriends birthday on a Friday night. It was a very busy night, which was encouraging in the hopes that a lot of people obviously like eating here. We sat at a round table in a corner of the dining room (we had a party of 6). Even though we were in a corner, it was extremely loud. I could barely hear my girlfriend who was sitting next to me...not much anyone can do about that, so that's not why I'm giving them 2 stars. 

The reason why is whoever is on the grill in the kitchen needs to find a new profession. I ordered the Fillet with lobster tail, and for paying upwards of $60 for that plate, my expectations should be somewhat high. Boy was I let down. I ordered the steak medium rare, it came out charred on the outside (literally crunchy each bite) yet bloody and undercooked on the inside. I hate sending food back, but for what I'm paying, I had no choice. The lobster was a bit dry, but I ate it anyways. By the time the second Fillet came out, everyone else had finished their meals. As soon as I laid eyes on it I could tell it was under cooked....again. It was so freaking bloody, I swear I heard it Moo. I could barely cut into it, it was so freaking rare. At that point I just told the waiter (who was a nice guy) that I did not want another one. He took it off the bill, as expected. 

Overall, if you're going to spend that kind of money on a nice dinner, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"We had a very good experience here. We were a party of 7 and had made a reservation which was acknowledged when we arrived but it still took us 15 minutes to be seated, which was a bit disappointing. Our waitress, however, made up for that with her great service and the food was really really good! They ran out of sweet tea so refills were not in the cards for us but other than that and the initial wait, it was a near-perfect experience. Great service, awesome food, nice environment (a little loud but it's Saturday night) and generous portion sizes."}
{"text":"Ok, they should be happy that I am understanding of the flying bug that landed in my dessert and died before it was served.  Yes, I found it as I was eating the dessert, grossed me out, but not necessarily their fault.  The manager came over and apologized and took the dessert off the bill and offered me another one.  Anyway, the rest of the meal was great.  My party and I had the scallops with green beans and capers.  Yummy!  I do like Pappadeaux's overall and this is the first time I didn't have a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is cool! It's crowded every time we come so expect a little bit of a wait. There's a lot to choose from on the menu and the portions are pretty big. They have a lovely cocktail menu as well. Come here when you wanna Treat Yo Self cuz it can be a touch pricey."}
{"text":"I have been a customer since the week they opened.  Up until Father's day weekend, I would have given them 5 stars or better.  My wife, our daughter, and our son and daughter-in-law went there Friday before Father's Day.  Drinks were terrible, and we tried several of their house specialties. Waitress messed up orders repeatedly.  Mediterranean Calamari which we recommend to all friends was tough as the sole of an old tennis shoe.  However, the waitress was nice and they were quite busy so we left a very nice tip on a tab over $300.  The next day I glanced at the receipt in my pocket and found that they had double charged on one of the entrees.  So, about $38 lost there too."}
{"text":"Always a killer meal here. King Crabs for the win! Love the atmosphere. One of our party knew the bartender on duty and he made it his life mission to get to know all of us and take care of us. 

King Crabs were cooked just like I like them. Hot and Juicy."}
{"text":"The best word to describe this restaurant...AWESOME!!  I  have found my new favorite dish...Jumbo Shrimp Brochette.  Wish Pappadeaux was in San Diego!

Everything was delicious!  Blue Point Oysters on the half shell, alligator bites, Jumbo Shrimp Brochette, Pasta Mardi Gras (spicy and creamy) and excellent desserts! Even the kid's menu was good.   Do yourself a favor and go indulge!!  

Our server Audrey was great.  She gave us helpful tips, suggestions and kept a great pace on the food.  Wish all servers were as efficient, professional and friendly as she was."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. I like to order from there appetizer menu and their seafood fondue is thee best! I haven't been here in a while but stopped by just to try there Mardi gras temporary cheesecake on a saturday evening. A band was setting up out on the patio and our waitress was awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food is great.  Taste fresh.  Doesn't have that  old fish taste.  Atmosphere is good.  Service is great.  I had oysters and shrimp then New Orleans crawfish etouffee. Everything was on point"}
{"text":"I have been eating oysters my whole life. I've been to every single place on the West Coast just about in these guys have the best or Oysters I've ever had.
Me and my girls favorite place to go!!!
I've tried everything on the menu and have never had anything bad!!
Service is great!!!
Bartenders are on point and the manager Destiny is super nice!!!
Best food/service/drinks!!!

David and Tonya"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a yummy lunch and had great great service by Kirk. He recommended the Costa Rican Tilapia and I'm so happy he did because it was delicious.  It was busy, but the service was so great by everyone that it didn't affect our experience."}
{"text":"The food is always wonderful here. Tried the Crab & Spinach dip this time, and it was phenomenal. My personal favorite is the Shrimp Brochette with dirty rice. I've also enjoyed the mixed seafood grill and the stuffed shrimp. Crab cakes are awesome too. Really, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience here. I came in and got seated immediately and my server was very attentive. I tried the fried and blacked alligator as an appetizer and was pretty good. As my main dish I got the redfish with shrimp and oh my, it was amazing. Lastly I tried both the bread pudding (forgot the name) and the pecan pie. Both of these deserts were phenomenal. Over all my experience here was great. The service was on point, the food tasted great but just one negative thing about this place were the tables being way to close to each other."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Seafood and Cajun food in all of Phoenix and the surrounding cities! A must try!"}
{"text":"We've only been here once, but would love to return. We had a great experience overall.  We visited on a Friday night, on a holiday weekend (and Fiesta Bowl weekend) and it was raining.  The place was packed. It because it's so big, the tables seemed to turn fairly quickly.   We were told it'd be an hour for a table for 2. They take your cell # and text you when your table is ready. They also have pagers available (for those of us whose cell service is extremely poor there!  Note - they had wifi for guests and we were able to get service but it was splotchy.)

We snagged seats at the very crowded bar for a drink and an app while we waited.   There must have been 7 bartenders on duty - which was awesome. The three women on our end of the bar regularly checked in with us for more drinks, etc.   (Note - drinks are good, and they have some of the NOLA staples like Hurricanes. Drinks ran about $10-11 a pop for their specialty cocktails.) 

We were called to our table in less than an hour.  Our server appeared right away and explained the menu to us and made recommendations.  The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was hot and tasty.  We held back a bit so we could save room for dessert, which also did not disappoint.  They have a lot of options for your sweet tooth.    Will definitely return as there were numerous menu items we did not get to try.  

Here's what we did have:    Voodoos and Swamp Things (drinks); Lump crab and spinach dip; filet (w/green beans and potatoes); stuffed jumbo shrimp; baked mac n cheese with crab; and NY cheesecake with strawberry."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Worth every dollar I paid! Great service, great environment and absolutely wonderful food. We've wanted to come here for quite a while but just have never been, wish we could've come here sooner! Hands down the best place I've been here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Always great food and service.  Their mignonette for the oysters is one of the best I have ever tasted. Great for a quick seafood fix or a nice sit down meal."}
{"text":"This place had some seriously amazing Louisiana style sea food dishes.  Too bad i showed up off-season for craw fish, but other than that, it was total class.  
They seated me and my friend in the corner but we end up having a great view of the place, and seemed a bit more intimate that way. This also gave us a great view of the outside seating area to people watch as well.
The food itself was very rich and delicious.  I don't remember the name of the dish but it featured baked oysters.  Every bite was delicious.
I am definitely coming back there if I am looking for a nice seat down in the West Valley."}
{"text":"Ryan (server and trainer) was absolutely amazing. He was very attentive to our party and knowledgeable about the menu. He provided great recommendations and pairings without coming across too informative. He was very kind, personable, and exceeded expectations. Looking forward to being in the area again, and we will be sure to ask to be seated in his section.
Great oysters at fair pricing. The cocktails are exceptionally made. A nice restaurant to swing into in between running errands around town."}
{"text":"we always have a good time here!  we love the alligator with the gator sauce...yumm!  hubby loves to get the different baked oysters.  I had a nice cod dinner and he had shrimp etoufee...both very good but plan on $24 for those plus drinks and appetizers it adds up.  Still, it's good service and a fun place."}
{"text":"Have been going to Pappaduex's off and on for awhile now.  Seems like I go through spurts where I wind up there several times in a row then not going back for what seems like a year.  That said, this chain is consistently good.  The service is always good, some times better than others but never bad.  
It is hard to find good creole and/or cajun food here and while this may not be considered authentic, it is good.  The alligator is lip smackin' good.
The atmosphere is somewhat lacking as the acoustics make conversation almost impossible.  Not a good place for a romantic meal, but a good place to have fun with friends."}
{"text":"Service was sub par especially for the price! Sat at the bar had 1 glass of wine and oysters, wanted to order dinner but could not get service! I was staying at the hotel next-door and will be staying there three more times but will not be back to this restaurant!! damn shame"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix! The Mediterranean calamari and coconut shrimp are the best appetizers! Their lobster is phenomenal, the best I've had. I would recommend creme brûlée for dessert! Cocktail of choice is the Frenchmans spritzer...or something like that ;) the ambiance is beautiful, there is often live music on the patio which is always the best! I'd highly recommend a reservation, otherwise you will wait 2 hours...worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Well, we were terribly shocked.  
We always rave about this restaurant, brought friends and 3 were disappointed
One of the favourite dishes was Maui Maui but it wasn't on menu anymore, so we asked and server said sure they do have, so Blacked was requested, it was horrific !!!  Tasted like something from freezer section, no taste and not blackened, rated meal a 0

Other dish was chicken linguini, not good either, picked all the tasteless chicken pieces out before he started on pasta which was ok!!!  Not good or great but ok

The table ordered 4 salmon glaze with 1scallop 2shrimp.   3rated it as a 3.5, other only eat 1/4 of meal, due to being drenched in a pool of butter.

What a shame
We went Monday night Nov 13,2017"}
{"text":"I hit this spot up before heading back to Southern California last weekend. I heard many good things so I had to check it out for myself. This place didn't disappoint me. I was promptly greeted when I walked into the restaurant by the host. Lisa, the waitress was very friendly and patient with me because I couldn't make up my mind. As soon as she said this is a cajun/seafood restaurant, I knew I was in Heaven. I snacked on some french bread as I was making this \"difficult\" decision of what to eat. The food was delicious. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Here on business and looking for a familiar delicious place to have a nice dinner. Pappadeaux never disappoints - their food seems to be really consistent between locations. Huge portions, awesome flavor combinations, fresh fish... what more could you hope for?! The highlight for me was the service. Kirk was warm and possessed an impressive amount of menu knowledge. He made helpful suggestions and even learned my name. My glass (and bread, and plate) was always full. Yet another great experience at one of the few reliable chains about. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal. You could literally close your eyes and point to anything on the menu and it's likely to be delicious. Portions are well sized, staff is always friendly and the food is always fresh. Plenty of seats that get filled quickly during dinner time. It's a little darker than I'd prefer during dinner but I get it, it's the ambiance."}
{"text":"The wife & I finally got back to give these guys another try by using the gift cards they sent us in apology for our last experience. This time was much better. Our server, JENNIFER (a trainer) was awesome. Never wanted, needed or had to ask for anything. She was on top of her game! Food was hot, fresh and came out in a relatively quick amount of time. I had the fried shrimp & catfish filets again and my wife tried the Lobster & Crab salad. We were both happy. We also started with a lobster bisque which was just slightly on the salty side. I still think the portions are small in relation to price. I had 5 shrimp and 2 catfish filets ($25). Overall, a save on their part in customer retention."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I don't like chains, but I do like Pappas. However, living in California, I rarely have a chance to patronize them. Was in town visiting this past weekend, so I finally had my chance. Turns out that we liked it so much on Saturday that we came back again the next night on Sunday!

In order to avoid the wait. we had reservations both times. On Saturday, Andres C. Rodriguez was singing and playing some beautiful acoustic guitar, so we decided to sit outside to listen. Even though it was over 80 degrees, it was OK, since the sun wasn't on us. Colin was our server, and he did a great job. Good selection of local beers on tap in 18 and 12 ounce sizes.

Started with Oysters Pappadeaux with crabmeat, spinach & hollandaise, which was absolutely insane! Mom and I agreed that it may indeed have been the best single dish that we have ever eaten and a good value at $13.95 for six. Despite the cooking, the oysters were still juicy and not overdone. I had the amazing Seafood Platter, which included Fried tilapia, shrimp, blue crab cake, stuffed shrimp & stuffed crab with French fries. So much food...I couldn't finish it! Had the fries and one of the tilapia fillets for breakfast! The tilapia was very lightly breaded and perfectly fired. Still very juicy inside. Perhaps the best fried fish anywhere. Mom had sauteed soft shell crabs with dirty rice. No...room...for...dessert! 

On Sunday, we went inside. Nice cozy, dark space. We tried to be clever, but we still over-ordered. Started with the complimentary warm baguette and the small Greek salad, which was expertly assembled table-side and was 100% crisp and fresh. Shared a full bowl of seafood gumbo. Amazing flavor, with okra, crab and tons of shrimp! Followed by Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes over crawfish in a light butter sauce ($23 for two) They were served with a garnish of potato sticks and a bit over-wrought for my taste. No need for breading...these deserve to be broiled. Loved the sauce...mopped it all up!

For our entree, we ordered the Crawfish sampler which was half fried crawfish and half Crawfish etouffee over dirty rice. Took a few bites of the fried while it was warm. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. No need for extra sauces. Took the rest to-go. Etouffee had tons of large, juicy tails. It was delicious, even when re-heated in a microwave (I know, god forbid!!!)

One of the good parts about a chain is consistency, in food quality and service. Both were made very clear at this location. The prices aren't cheap, but it's not ridiculous either. Both times, our bill for two, with drinks was in the $90 range. Wish I lived closer. I'm now dying to find proper Gulf Coast seafood in Los Angeles...it's not easy!"}
{"text":"We went in early on a Wed. to avoid the rush.  We sat in a bar booth.  They have a good variety of seafood to pick from the menu, which is something you don't see all the time in Arizona.  Service was good, but began to feel a little rushed as we lingered over desert.  We split a Caesar Salad which was very fresh but a bit overdressed and it came with a small loaf of warm French bread..  The 2 different salmon dishes we ordered were really good, well seasoned and cooked to exactly as ordered (didn't need the side sauce.)  By the way the house margarita is pretty good as well. One came out with broccoli rob instead of the green beans on the menu, but  the waiter quickly took it back and returned with the beans and gave us a couple glasses of wine for the mistake.  We finished with coffee and a Pecan Cheesecake which was very good. When we left there were a bunch of people inline waiting for a table and the place was packed. All and all we considered the experience to be positive and will return again. I have heard wait time during peak time can be greater than a hour, so I would suggest to go in off hours or plan a large wait time."}
{"text":"So freaking delicious!   I love this place.  Crawfish Etouffee is to die for!"}
{"text":"We love the food here but quite honestly had the most hideous service ever!  Our waiter would walk by, see we needed drinks, whatever and go hang out with the hostess.  Every time we had to throw a hand up....bizarre because it's not cheap! I finally went in to ask him to please take our order and a manager I thought took note but actually not.  We drive 30+ minutes to get here and most likely won't do it again!  Back to our old school
Salt Cellar...if jimmy n is your waiter run for your life!"}
{"text":"Came here for Oysters Blue Point which were very good. The presentation was nice. The server we had which was a lady was new but very professional, and accommodating. I was here for a business meeting and the manager came by the table to confirm with my partner on the ingredients in a soup that he had ordered to avoid any food allergies. The service is pretty good here but on this particular day I was really blown away. They have gotten better over the years with changing their menu, and providing the best service. They really left a lasting impression on my client as well as myself"}
{"text":"Pappadaux is my favorite seafood place in Phoenix!  The alligator is fabulous and tastes just like chicken!  The portions are huge so we usually split an entree, have an app and some wine and still get out of there for $100 and are stuffed.  You can swap out the fish on the menus with any other fish they have.  So if the menus says it's a salmon dish, you can pick a red fish or halibut or anything else they have."}
{"text":"Good food but unless you make reservations it's a long wait. Super loud in there. Becoming less of a favorite for me."}
{"text":"Experienced happy hour for the first time.  Amazing food and drink for cheap prices.  Only downer the bar tender.  It was a pasted on smile.  I will return and take people with me."}
{"text":"IMHO the meals at Pappadeaux look better than they actually taste.  The flavors were either underwhelming or over salted.  But, they have a great staff that aims to please and is very good about providing substitutions for anything on their extensive menu.  

What I found amazing were the desserts.  And as picky az I'm iz, it's hard to find amazing restaurant food.  Anyway, this review is strictly for the dessert.  Very yummy!  If I could eat sweets all day, I would order all desserts and feast like a Roman.  

The usual suspects:  vanilla cheesecake, praline cheesecake, chocolate cake, bread pudding, creme brule, banana pudding, key lime pie, pecan/sweet potato pie.  Some were topped a la mode, some with yummy creme, berries, thin vanilla wafer, and came with sauces.  (I don't care for sweet sauces with desserts.  That's just overkill.  For goodness sake, aren't we obese enough?)

Who(m)ever is doin' the desserts is mmm oohhh mmm yeah

doin' it and doin' it and doin' it WOW 
doin' it and doin' it and doin' it WOW 

The portions are large so unless you're a glutton like me, you'll need to share.  Move over salmon!  These are the ones that I made room for:

1.  Banana pudding comes in a mason jar that's your keepsake.  Make sure you get a lid, too.  Topped with a tall serving of whipped cream, side strawberry, and a thin vanilla wafer.  I hadn't eaten whipped cream in such a long time, I ate it fast but it took a good five minutes before actually getting to the pudding.  Not a pudding fan, but it looked so pretty, I had to try it.  

2.  Slices of cheesecakes looked about 4\" in height and the top is browned so you can tell that they've been baked, deliciously, and then topped with whipped cream and berries.  One came with strawberry sauce, the other with caramel sauce.  The cheese sat on thick graham [Of Course!] crust.  It was hard to stop eating - ur, tasting - these.  

3.  Slice of key lime pie was...key lime pie.  Decent sweet / tartness and a good thick crust.  Holds its own, but I'm not an avid eater of key lime.

4.  Slice of pecan/sweet potato pie came a la mode, quite sweet, and came with bourbon sauce.  The top is packed with pecan halves layered over the sweet potato.  Unfortunately the syrup from the pie, over powers the potato layer (which I could not even taste) and seeps into the crust.  I love pecans.  I love sweet potato.  But I gots no love for syrup.  It sort of ruined the pie.  Did I eat it though?  Sho' nough!"}
{"text":"After all the positive reviews the hubby & I decided to check it out. Upon entering everything looks great, the place is spacious and we were greeted and seated immediately. 

I ordered the cajun comb and my husband got the tilipia. While we're waiting for our meals to arrive our waiter offered us fresh baked bread right out of the oven. Not wanting to fill up on bread we declined. We're still sitting there when a roach scurries arcoss the ledge near our booth. ALL BUGS FREAK ME OUT!!!!!!! My husband said it wasn't that big a deal and I should just calm down. The table next to us received their food a couple of minutes before us, as soon as the waiter sat the food on the tray flies swarmed. I tried not to FREAK out but I was really getting uneasy about the safety of our food. Finally, our food comes out a couple of minutes later and I'm eyeballing it like a hawk.....no flies touched it, but it didn't stop them from trying to attack our food once it arrived. It's hard to enjoy your meal while you're swatting away flies and make sure roaches are coming up behind you. 

On to the food, my fish was salty and my husband's was buttery. 2 perfectly good pieces of fish were ruined.

While I went to the restroom my hubby ordered a slice of keylime pie for me. The pie was delicious, our waiter was great, the people watching is extremely interesting, but we will never return here."}
{"text":"I would've given Pappadeaux a 5 star rating, but our service the day I went wasn't the best. Other than that, they have a great gluten free menu! Check out my full review here: http://www.adventuresofahungrylatina.com/restaurant-review-pappadeaux/"}
{"text":"Lived in Louisiana for three years. Best Crawfish served daily. The Bisque soup is the very best with Crawfish isn't it amazingly great. Good deserts and Cold beer and great Wine."}
{"text":"I went here for my dad's wedding reception I made a reservation for 10 people and they have a table ready a half an hour before the reserved time. They also texted me to remind me of the reservation before hand. The staff let me set up decorations on the table before the couple arrived and they even offered to help. Our waitress Jannie was super sweet and very attentive!!! Loved her. The restaurant even paid for the newlyweds meal, those small touches really made the experience great. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food is pricey but if you need a spot to celebrate this will get the job done. Everything was delicious and service was well done."}
{"text":"Thank you, Pappadeaux, for giving us landlocked Phoenicians a nice seafood place that doesn't break the bank.  The relatives from up north were coming to town and the request was for those classicly native Phoenician foods, lobster and crab legs.  There were going to be 8 of us, and I was getting ready to take out the $1,000 bank loan when Yelp pointed me to Pappadeaux.   Thank goodness they take reservations for 8 or more.  I'm all over it.

Turns out it was crawdad night (crawfish for you cultured Creoles), and the place was an absolute madhouse.  We lucked out finding a parking spot and slowly made our way through the crush of people waiting outside.  I lost my entire party in the crowd and by the time I made it to the hostess desk was sure our reservation was a goner.  But the disheveled hostess, who probably suffers from PTSD after that night, said we were good.  whew.  I sent a rescue crew to retrieve my lost troops.

It was incredibly noisy so we had to do some strategic table placement for the hard of hearing.

The service was impeccable.  Demands for substitutions, butter sent back because it was too salty, help needed for seafood haters - our waiter fielded them all calmly and accommodated even the pickiest requests. 

Everyone loved their food, which really was very good.  I got my favorite banana pudding - who needs an entree, really.  The bill was reasonable and everyone was happy.  Another mission accomplished, another bullet dodged."}
{"text":"This place is aight. I would come here for the oyster appitizer. in fact that's probably the only reason why i would come here. The food is ok at best, nothing that really blows me away. I still think this place is over priced for what it really is. Honestly if you want sea food for cheap, and sea food that i caught and cooked the same day, just go to mexico. It's better, its more fresh, and you don't get ripped off (unless you're an idiot and you set yourself up for failure)."}
{"text":"Had the Costa Rican Blackened Mahi-Cooked Perfectly
Also had the Oyster Duo-Both were excellent.
Very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I just don't see how this place gets so much credit. Maybe the illusion of how good it is is set by the high prices. Having lived in Louisiana for 18 years, this place doesn't do Cajun a whole lot of justice. Yet it's always packed which makes it less appealing in my book. There is no desirable ambiance and the tables are snugged up together too tight to make conversion at your own enjoyable.

There are more atmosphere friendly places in the valley with much better food and much better prices, like Baby Kay's. Spices are much more spot on as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food! Great drinks! Beautiful patio and copeous amounts of space for parties of all shapes and sizes."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux was definitely a highlight of my trip to PHX. The Oysters were great, fried alligator was moist, bread was fresh, lobster bisque was flavorful (altho a tad salty), and the blacked cat fish I had was cooked perfectly. 

Hard to imagine better than this outside of NOLA.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in as it was an easy pit-stop on our way home from flagstaff to Tucson. Our meals were a-ok. Service was slow considering the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived. The waiter was apologetic and implied they were having kitchen issues.

I had the catfish lunch plate that came with a shrimp, toast gravy dish on the side and fries. (Sorry I can't recall what the side was called) Fries were really bad, also tasted old. Plenty of shrimp with dish and the gravy was good. Pretty heavy dish! I'll agree with Cindy N- definitely a ton of salt in their dishes. The catfish was tasty. My other half had the Pasta Mardi Gras and enjoyed it, seemed to be plenty of seafood in it as well. Although he said there was very little heat to it. 

I don't know if we will rush here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here on Saturday night after the D'Backs game and were told there would be an hour and half wait.  The very visually frazzled hostess kept her composer and let us know that the bar area is first come first serve so we decided to try there.  We scored some seats within 10 minutes and were immediately met by Sarah the bartender and the smiles and service never stopped.  Based on our questions Sarah knew it was our first time and really explained their menu and how everything works.  Our whisky was 10$ a glass but based on the \"long pour\" it was worth it.  There was a mistake in the kitchen and someone miss ordered a crab legs, we scored because Sarah brought them to us to try.  AMAZING... I ordered a sampler trio as our appetizer and the wife loved it all until she realized it was not breaded chicken and little chunks of lobster in the seafood fondue (I may have led her on a little) but rather alligator and crawfish.  The smile on her face (maybe the whisky) or just the general fun atmosphere and the food quality was well worth the total bill at the end of the night.  I can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I've tried almost everything on the menu from the gumbo to the alligator and this place doesn't ever fall short. Definitely try it if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix! It's food is not like anything else I've really found anywhere else. The alligator tail is amazing and I love the waiter told me you can order it half fried and half blackened bc both ways is delish! The only downside is it's a little pricey but you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I love this place - I especially love their Fried chef's platter and the Calamari appetizer.  I often have the Calamari appetizer for dinner - it is THAT good. The Calamari is fried but then mixed with artichokes and feta cheese and tossed with a lemon garlic sauce.  It is really wonderful.  My husband and son love the fried cray fish and my son loves the catfish.  Here is the thing - I don't think they take reservations so you have to just get there early.  Bar seating is limited or you sit outside so if they are crowded, you may have to wait.  It is very popular so often crowded.  But, it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This always a go to spot for us for great seafood. Even though they were busy as heck tonight they offered to comp an entree for me. The service is great and food is amazing and tasty. The unique atmosphere and ambience makes you feel like your in the dirty south. Love this place. I had the usual appetizer trio and also the scallops in my opinion were the best!"}
{"text":"I don't give five stars very often, but yes Pappadeaux's deserves them all. Coming from the east coast, I do miss my seafood. I'm a bit wary of any seafood I get in the Valley because it obviously has to be flown or trucked into the desert. 

Pappadeaux's was recommended to me before I even arrived in Phoenix. The moving company driver told me about this place when he was loading my belongings on his 18-wheeler in North Carolina. I found the place on Yelp, showed him the picture, and he said, \"Yep! That's it!\" I bookmarked it in the app to check out. 

I've been here a couple times already, but for some reason hadn't reviewed it yet. I most recently came with a friend for his company dinner (dinner on the boss! yay!). I had lobster, shrimp, oysters (fried and on the half-shell), calamari, and something else I can't even remember. The food has always been great. They have some pretty good salads and other items on the menu if you're not into seafood (my friend isn't, so that came in handy).  

Love this place -- will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Have to be the best and the freshest seafood money can buy. Price is little bit on the higher side but the quality is as great as the price. Worth it."}
{"text":"We only go here about once a year to celebrate something really special. However, I crave the Chilean sea bass dinner all year long. It's some of the best I've ever had. It is pricey, but worth it. My husband always tries something different and everything he's tried has been perfect and delicious."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday and was very busy but they were able to seat us right away. Took my parents for the first time and my Mom was not so sure about what kind of food it was. Me, my wife and Dad loved what we ordered...fried oysters, fried crayfish, and Dad had the shrimp special. So the first part of this review is to say the food was awesome! So now  how the service is awesome! My Mom was not too adventurous so only originally  ordered a salad...even while we all sat waiting for Mom to order, our server Ryan did not get annoyed...did not act like \"come on lady\" but was so nice and waited. Then...my Mom decided she wanted an appetizer...the awesome crab Mac'N'Cheese. Ryan did warn us that since he already put in our entree  order he could not guarantee it would come out at the same time...I know Ryan made sure that happened! Our order came out awesome and all at the same time...and mom loved the dish!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went to Pappadeaux's for a sisterly dinner a few nights ago and had a good time. 

For apps we ordered fried alligator and fried frogs legs. I've had alligator before so the fried alligator was very tasty! The fried frogs legs... well that gets a \"meh\" from the both of us. But the fried alligator pretty much set the bar for everything else.

My entre was fried oysters and fried catfish with a baked potato. It was a lot of food and we did end up getting baggies for our left overs. Our bad for filling up on the apps and warm bread.  OH yesh, you get fresh bread and butter along with your drinks. :) Awesome.

We did order dessert.. and those were very very delicious!

My overall exp' with this place was great. Our waitress was good. She was very knowledgeable and did not act condescending with all of my questions. 

The atmosphere was good.. that place has good vibes!

I really don't have anything negative to say other than maybe the pricey food, but that's really it. And what we spent for 2 people, including tip, was about $100.00. 

My sister would say some of the food was salty. 

Would I eat here again? Yes. But I'd probably say no to the bread so I can thoroughly enjoy my entre, lol."}
{"text":"I love this place. From gumbo, to crawfish I have never had anything bad here. 
The service is always stellar, I have had the pleasure to talk to some of the new waiters in training and it is intense apparently. They have to have the menus memorized backwards and forwards and be able to answer just about any question you can think of on the spot.

However if I can give one piece of advise:
Save room for dessert. Their dessert tray is to die for and they will bring it to your table so you can see everything on it and make your choice, then they will make you a fresh one of whatever you choose.

Pros: 
Great for families
Great food
Amazing Service

Con:
Kinda expensive on the wallet"}
{"text":"Visited Pappadeaux's on a Friday around 8pm and there was no wait so we quickly ordered drinks and began looking at the menus.  We munched on bread while we waited for our dinner.  I ordered the Seafood Platter ($25) while my friend ordered a pasta and seafood dish ($30).  Our waiter was Brian and he was a friendly guy. He appeared to be new as he had to see the menu to know what sides and such we would receive.  The blue lump crab cake was good, but not as good as I remembered. All the food seemed to taste the same.  I also had the spaghetti squash and it was fairly bland. My friend devoured her pasta and seafood dish, but it wasn't much food for the price."}
{"text":"Great spot. Had oysters YUMMY.. Ryan at the bar..Awesome service.. This is the spot for seafood in the desert.huge menu. Beautiful outdoor   seating"}
{"text":"I had the Crispy Alaskan Salmon & Scallop, and Crete Brûlée. Both were excellent. My main arrived a little cool. I asked the server to warm it up. The manager cane over right away, treated me to a beverage, and removed the main from my bill (which was not necessary but appreciated). I enjoyed every bite. Excellent old fashioned service and cooking deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm going to have to give my first awful review. Waited 15 minutes for our first waiter visit, then another 15 minutes for a glass of water, so we were 45 minutes in before ordering. I had such high hopes for a good sea food experience in the desert. Their menu says, \"fresh fish flown in daily,\" but I know what frozen filets taste like. I ordered the naked halibut. The Brussels sprouts were flavorful, burnt and very oily. Oily as in sitting in a pool of oil. The halibut might have been okay if it had come out to the table on time but it had obviously sat in the window for at least 15 or 20 minutes, because it was maybe just barely luke warm and extremely dry. I was tempted to suffer through it with a smile but three bites in I crunched into a small pebble. I gave up after that. My wife ordered the redfish risotto. The risotto was decent but the fish was cold, dry and over salted. Son ordered chicken fingers. They were extra extra well done (over fried) as well, and he said the fries tasted like cardboard. Truly disappointing."}
{"text":"This was a very good place the food was awesome and very good I would love to keep going back but I don't have the money super good eating there if I become rich I will always be there"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, very fresh seafood, and a nice ambience. Our server was a bit wet behind the ears, but polite. I would definitely come here again! Good place for a date night."}
{"text":"I have never been here before and based on my experience tonight I do not see a return anytime soon. My evening started when we were seated in probably the worst seat in the house. I asked the hostess for a booth and she ignored my request. I wear a prosthetic leg, so a booth is prefered.Then she sits us at a seat that is right next to the main line of traffic and right by the door. There were many other tables available in the restaurant.The table was about to fall over because it was not leveled out. We were approached by a stuffy waiter that was snobbish and rude.  He was not delightful at all. When we placed our order , I was informed that what i wanted was not available. I asked why the hostess or he did not tell us when we sat down that some items were sold out. I was simply responded with a completely ridiculous excuse. Since my guest had already ordered I was rushed into making a selection. The waiter left and the manager came over and was far from genuine in assisting us, mentioning in a sarcastic tone that she heard I was not happy. After offering absolutely no remediation whatsoever she left. I am still confused as to why she even came by.  When our food came the lady that delivered it, simply walked up and started moving plates that we were eating our appetizers off of. She dumped our food off without a word... 

On a single positive note the food was good, but I can get bad service at a fraction of the price anywhere. I am convinced that this restaurant has convinced themselves that they are too good for their guests.  

Summary: Bad service, horrible guest service from every single person we came in contact with and the seating is clearly specific to what they think you are going to spend or some other type of metric that I am unaware of. I have to say that this was the absolute worst dining experience that I have had in a fine restaurant ever in my life. It is to bad, because the food was really good."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait 10 minutes on the phone just to place a togo order, and then deal with a rude server on the other end. The food was flavorless, which is the furthest thing from what you expect from a creole inspired restaurant. I tried to contact management and was not followed up with."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants around!!!.. Austrailian lobster tails....fried gator...pretty much everything on the menu is terrific!!!. If ever near or passing a pappadeaux's, please stop and go sit down and eat and you will not be disappointed!!!. When in the area this is my favorite place to dine at!!!!!.:)"}
{"text":"What a treat it was to eat here. For appetizers we had the fried alligator, calamari, baked oysters and raw on the half shell.  For dinner I had the ATLANTIC SALMON ALEXANDER - Blackened salmon with shrimp, scallops & crawfish in a white wine cream sauce, with dirty rice. Everything was prepared to perfection. The service was outstanding and the atmosphere was phenomenal. This was my second time eating at this restaurant. The first was in TX and now in AZ.  It is a seafood lovers paradise. Enjoy."}
{"text":"For being a chain restaurant, Pappadeaux is pretty good.  For an appetizer, I usually have the Blackened Shrimp & Crawfish Fondeaux or the Lump Crab & Spinach Dip;  both are luscious and come with French bread.  My two favorite entrees are the Crawfish Etouffee with white rice and the Pontchartrain Panbroiled Fillet.  My adult beverage of choice is the Swamp Thing.  I do not know what is in it but it is quite tasty and pretty to look at (Yes, I'm a girl!).  I have never had dessert;  have always been too full.  However, my sister and nephew swear by the banana pudding which is served in a Mason jar (Ick!).

The only real draw back  to Pappadeaux is the wait for a table.  No matter when I have gone, the wait has always been at least an hour."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING I have had here is amazing. I'm just going to make this review short and sweet. GO THERE. It's worth the wait. Always busy, but fun atmosphere and you will love the appetizers, entrees and desserts. AND the drinks. Only place I will make the drive to from Gilbert. I heard people travel from different states to come here! I get it now! ;)"}
{"text":"What can I say, oysters are the bomb here, and the deserts are top notch, my favorites are the key lime pie and tried a new one called pumpkin cheesecake - delicous!"}
{"text":"Ok, it has been awhile since we ate here. The food is pretty good, but not outstanding this time. It used to be out standing. The portion sizes used to be outstanding; not anymore. The service used to be outstanding...and yes not anymore. I will allow everyone has an off night, but Aubrey B. Was not very on tonight....sorry. Ok baked oysters where very good...the rested just ok."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile now..I've been hearing few of my coworkers that the food is pretty good.. it's a little pricey but other then that it was pretty good.. we ordered the calamari which I liked..we ordered the small portion which I thought was the perfect amount before having our meal.. my boyfriend ordered the soft shell crab and I ordered the mardi gra pasta which was pretty delicious.. the restaurant is pretty big, bigger then I thought it was going to be... the staff was pretty friendly and even though it was a little busy our waitress still checked up on us which I liked..."}
{"text":"Your one-stop destination for all the Cajun food you've been craving. Met up with friends here for a Wednesday night outing, so that we could try their boiled crawfish. I have to say that this is crawfish done right... and at $3.95/lb, you can't beat the value.

We started with an appetizer of Blackened Shrimp & Crawfish Fondeaux with garlic bread, which was free by using a coupon I got by signing up on their website and providing my e-mail address. I would've been a bit disappointed if I had paid for this particular appetizer, since it skimped on the bits of seafood and wasn't a particularly well-done fondue (not nearly cheesy enough), but it kept the group I was with something to nosh on while we waited on our entree orders. Judging from the other reviews, this place is always busy.

I was very happy with the 7-oz. Blackened Mahi Yvette covered with shrimp, crawfish, mushrooms and spinach in a Monterey Jack cheese sauce. No need to order the larger 11-oz. filet, since I had already started filling up on bread, fondue, and a dinner salad. The dirty rice was delicious and scarfable.

Everyone seemed more than happy with their selections as we all shared and sampled from each others' plates of oysters on the half shell, boiled crawfish, and fried alligator. I think the place delivered a great value on the meal, a fantastic selection of nearly every Cajun delight you can think of (although I have yet to spot the elusive Muffaletta on area restaurants' menus), and a great dining experience. This place IS busy... I can only imagine the crowd on the weekends, but the wait staff did their best to be attentive and tend to all of our requests.

We left satisfied and stuffed, reeking of Cajun spices. Now if only they had some Oompah Loompahs available to roll me to my car..."}
{"text":"With seafood cravings at an all time high, I had high expectations of Pappadeaux, I mean it has the word seafood in it's name after all ...

I came here for dinner with intentions of ordering oysters and possibly trying their other signature items I've heard so much about. Kind of gimmicky since it's has that themed restaurant feel, think Bubba Gump's, Red Lobster and the likes. It's dark and covered with seaside/fishing decor.

I went with a Watermelon Lemonade to sip on. A dozen Blue Point oysters and the Appetizer Trio to share. No entrees here as we knew this place does hefty portions. The service here is good and very quick, they refill waters with a quickness!

The Watermelon Lemonade was okay, just a lemonade with watermelon syrup and really sweet.

The Blue Point Oysters were good, though they came with horseradish, cocktail sauce ,spicy soy sauce and lemons, I was hoping they would at least have served it with a mignonette. The horseradish was okay, cocktail sauce too sweet and the spicy soy sauce was just plain wrong. I ended up eating the oysters with lemon and tabasco. Nice and slightly more briney than the Pacific oysters that were also on the menu and had more of a bite to them.

The Appetizer Trio came with fried gator, Crawfish/Shrimp Fondeaux and Smoked Salmon. To be quite honest, the fried gator is hands down amazing! I have never had gator and didn't expect it to be so juicy, tender and delicious. The sauce they serve it with is such a great pairing. The Smoked Salmon was juicy and cooked well, slightly smokey flavor. The Fondeaux tasted too strange for my liking, the shrimp tasted off, crawfish was a bit tough and the cheese for the Fondeaux did not pair well with the seafood and garlic bread.

This place is pretty pricey, appetizers go from $10-16 and the entrees from what I recall go from $25+ 

The only thing that was good about Pappadeaux was their fried gator, other than that I would have to pass."}
{"text":"If you have a spare $100 and are not real hungry go here. Long wait,poor service very average food at best but hard to tell when it comes out cold"}
{"text":"Two stars for service- food as always great but do not have a large party here- we where a party of 14 and quite frankly it was way to overwhelming for our waitress- after some fraustrating minutes waiting on our drink I asked the manager if she needed help? Manager did she was one of her better waitress- we'll all went down hill from that moment - 20 minutes wait for refills, drinks and that is with constantly asking- I can go on.
It a shame because I was entertaining customers and they were quite surprised by the service.
One more thing - I ordered desert to go, when I got to my hotel- no utensils! Well fist time I had cheese cake as a finger food."}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour today.  The bartender was very attentive. I ordered shrimp and crawfish fondeaux and catfish beignets. I also ordered a large swamp thing to drink. The swamp thing was really good. The catfish beignets were delicious. I didn't love the fondeaux though. First of all it had mushrooms in it and I hate mushrooms. But also the shrimp tasted like dirty dishwater, which is not unusual for shrimp in my opinion, but that ruined the fondeaux for me. Overall my experience was A-Ok."}
{"text":"all the way from cali,had to have this place oh how i love the food great place icant lie i love there food"}
{"text":"I am all about great customer service and after my last experience, I considered Pappadeaux's off of our restraurant rotation. I was promptly contacted by the customer relations department and they assured me that my experience did not meet their standards for service or food.  This level of attention exceeded my expectations. After another visit, I am once again a FAN!!!!"}
{"text":"Well worth the drive from Chandler... there have been many who have tired to duplicate but this is the closest to NOLA food there is here in the valley.  The atmosphere is great, the staff is always prompt and polite... and if you sign up for the email club you get a comp dessert for your birthday..get here"}
{"text":"I personally think this is great food! Best clam chowder I've ever had. The wait can be harsh and long,  but it's worth it and it gets really busy so I understand why. overall, great food and great waitresses and waiters!"}
{"text":"Oh Papadeaux, you are one of my most f-a-v-o-r-i-t-e places to go enjoy a lovely, fresh and deliciously flavorful creole or Cajun seafood meal. I love the ambiance of this place as it truly feels like I'm back again in NOLA. I don't even mind waiting 30 or so minutes to be seated while live blues music serenades me in preparation for those addictive flavors to come. The sights, the smells, the sounds, the service and most importantly the flavors, Papadeaux consistently delivers the entire package. I most certainly will return again and again!"}
{"text":"Honestly this was the best meal with my family in a very long time. Not only is this place absolutely beautiful, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the food is amazing! I had the spiked cherry limeade with my dinner (yum!). We also had both the calamari  and the alligator and appetizers. My husband and daughter had steak and lobster and I had the grilled shrimp brochettes. Each dish was fresh and flavorful! Not a dud in the bunch. We had a wonderful time and are looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Been craving Pappadeaux's ... I'm from out of town and try to stop by whenever I pass through Phoenix. I have to say that this trip by far was my best experience. From the moment we walked through the door till the moment we left the service was beyond fantastic. Cierra our server was incredibly knowledgable, attentive, friendly and could not have been any better. (Thank you) drinks never with empty food was quick and fresh and absolutely delicious as usual. I eat out often and don't typically do too many yelp reviews but could not go another moment without posting how satisfied we were with our experience. Thanks again Cierra for being so wonderful."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate with Pappadeaux. Their prices are high, the selection is great but not so great.  $20 for a catfish plate is exorbitant; however, what they do, they do it well.  The catfish was perfect, especially with a side of grits and bottle of Louisiana hot sauce.  The platters are huge and enough for two people to share. Not much in the way of non-seafood options - which made it hard for my family members that don't eat seafood to find something. That menu needs to be expanded to more than $40 steaks.  

The Mediterranean Calamari appetizer is $20 and the best app on the menu - however, it's a huge plate for a large table.  I wish had a smaller option.  Only 2 people at our table would eat such a thing but no way could we tackle such a huge plate and calamari isn't something you can take home for later. 

This restaurant has the best patio in the valley.  Open air, fans and misters, lots of greenery and shade.  I could spend forever on Pappadeaux's patio. 

Our waiter was excellent, though the food took a long time. I think it was the stinking steak being cooked. 

*So here is your take-way: Only come with seafood lovers (the rest will be uncomfortable), sit on the patio, have plenty of time to hang out, and be prepared for a high bill - but you won't be disappointed by the food or the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this restaurant for the past 10 years and have always had great food and service . But this time was horrible! Me and wife wife usually seat at the bar for dinner and have great time. We went tonight and Bartender/waiter didn't know what they were doing . No silverware asked twice then were provided. Waited 10 minutes before asked for the order and waited 20 min just to get the appetizer . One of the appetizers were had to be send back . The bartenders Dominic and cierra  had no energy , and enthusiasm and provided horrible service no attention to detail."}
{"text":"Food and service is amazing!  Waitress Audrey was excellent!!!!  Everything that is seafood is so good. I cannot wait to dine here again next!"}
{"text":"Went on date night and was Amazed! Fantastic food, great staff, awesome cocktails! Just have to be patient, it's Very popular, which means it Very crowded and long wait! But the bar helps with that!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre food. The wife's lobster was dry, my pasta dish had shrimp and inedible pieces of sausage. The ambiance was crowded and hectic, service was nothing to brag about. Bread was late, but was about the best thing about the meal. I think I'll not be returning."}
{"text":"Have been here once before  and decided to bring my daughter here for her first time. Though they were not crowded, they took us to the very back to were there was a party of 15 and the surrounding tables were full. You would think they would spread out the guests so we didn't feel like we were on top of each other.
I agree with many, that the food is fine but is overpriced. I ordered mussels, which I have had before. When they came, I immediately was taken aback by the smell. I tried one and it turned to to mush in my mouth, I had to spit it out. From what I have learned, theses mussels were caught when spawning which cause their meat to turn to mush. Had to send back and order something else. 
It is also very noisy and hard to have a good conversation.
All in all, an ok experience, just ok food for a high price."}
{"text":"I really don't give 5 stars that often (ever?) but I absolutely love Pappadeaux.

Both times I have eaten there, I've gotten absolutely delicious food across the board.  Typically I will have appetizers (mussels, clams, some gumbo, etc.) but I've also had the trout (which was delicious).  I find their food seasoned well, balanced in flavor, and visually appetizing without tasting too greasy or obnoxiously oily/buttery.

They are open late as well, and the drinks are outstanding.  Fresh lime juice margaritas, not too sweet, with Patron where they don't skimp on the booze?  What can be better?

Pardon my brevity on this review, but just go and you won't be disappointed.  Hats off to the Pappas' group for bringing a great restaurant to Phoenix.  Please don't expand and ruin a good thing either!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite seafood restaurant! It is pricey, and on some nights there is a long wait, but the food is excellent! If you go in the winter sit outdoors, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I'm having a real hard time writing a review for this restaurant. I want to write a great review, but I don't wanna use the words \"superb\" or \"excellent\" when describing the food, and I don't wanna say the service was \"friendly\" since all of these are overdone. So let me give this a shot: 

Upon walking inside I'm greeted with \"The Saints Go Marching In\" playing in the background and the aroma of some great food being served. The four of us go to the auxiliary bar (4 stools inside, main purpose is to drink up the patio guests) and have a seat and order drinks from our lovely waitress. Her timing was right on the button with EVERYTHING as drinks were always full and there was no lull between courses. 

As for the food, WOW. For the appetizer I went with an order of the Lotsa Shrimp. One dozen cold boiled shrimp (whatever cold boiled means) served with cocktail sauce mixed with fresh horseradish. Boy let me tell you that puts every shrimp cocktail I've had between San Francisco and New York to shame. Just the right amount of kick to it, but not the same old lame old. 

For the entree I had the Pasta New Orleans. Overall just an explosion in Cajun flavoring going on in my bowl. A wonderful blend of linguine, crawfish, sausage, mushrooms, and jumbo shrimp mixed in with a creamy yet spicy marinara sauce. And unlike every other place that skimps on the fish, you will not be disappointed here. Portions here are big, so bring an appetite. 

I hate writing lengthy reviews, (yes this is lengthy to me) but this place deserves it. One of the best meals I've had in a long time as far as value for the meal, overall presentation of the meal and restaurant, and just an overall well trained and attentive staff. 

I normally don't drive west of the 51 freeway, but I'm looking for reasons to do so now."}
{"text":"Soooo amazing! The 1000+ positive reviews alone show how good this restaurant is and they were right. I was very impressed with the food and service here. Came on a Saturday late night and when I called around 8pm to gauge to wait I was told 45 minutes to 1 hour yikes. We decided to go anyway and take our chances. Just our luck that soon as we put our names down a booth in the bar area opened up so we got super lucky and were able to get seated instantly. My sister and I shared baked crab mac and cheese, gumbo, crawfish bisque and fried shrimp with fries. Don't come here with a small appetite because the menu is so vast that it's so tempting to order more and more just to try everything especially if you are a seafood lover like myself. I thought the prices were reasonable which was another impressive point. The drink menu is also very expansive with lots of cool options so overall this is a great place not just for food, but if you want just a drink since the bar area itself is quite large. For sure recommend!"}
{"text":"They've gone down in general.  Portions are smaller for happy hour.  Service is still aright.  Drained the pond out front.  Sad.  Bread and butter were not fresh last week and I always look forward to THAT simple pleasure .  We can forgive the burnt and salty lobster since they gave us a new one on the house without us even asking.  Just disappointed as we used to LOVE this place."}
{"text":"While returning from a trip up North, the timing was perfect to head over to Pappadeaux (only 1 location in the Valley) en route to heading home. Typically the wait can be LONG but catching them on Sunday afternoon for lunch was perfect.

Just me and the kid and I sold the idea of this place over a fast food chain after being in the car for a while. As expected, no real wait. We were seated immediately but after the initial table, I made a request to move us to the bar area with a booth and a view of the AFC Championship Football game. Worked out perfectly!!! 

Needing a drink, I went with the Strawberry Mangearux Tango drink, a Kids Fried Shrimp & fries meal, and a Louisiana Gumbo & Po boy combo. I wasn't sure what to expect with the PoBoy but figured if it wasn't enough shrimp I'll just steal from the kid. That wasn't the case for lunch. Po Boy sandwich had plenty of shrimp (maybe just 1 sliced pickle too much, but easy to remove) and good complimentary ingredients. Bread used wasn't the same as the baguette type brought out with butter prior to the meal but same taste. Instead of Fries with the Po Boy, that's where the Gumbo came into play. A few choices, but when I heard Andouille sausage everything was a blur. With family roots tied to the south and one of the family's specialized \"go to meal\" of gumbo, It's always hard for me not to be critical of any others. This one was cool... A little too much juice, but decent flavor. I like mine a bit thicker so some Gumbo Filet may have helped resolve. 

Good options for lunch and the timing from order to table wasn't so bad with the football game playing & kids menu games going on. Next time I plan to give the oysters and fish a go as many of the fish plates leaving the kitchen were looking good..."}
{"text":"The best Cajun seafood I've had so far. Everything was perfect as far as service and food. Expect to wait a little bit on a weekend, but well worth it. Everything had the right flavors and serving sizes are large! Shared the alligator bites as an appetizer which I recommend! The Mardi Gras pasta was huge portion but soo good! The praline cheesecake was literally life changing. Love this place and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Son of a gun, had some fun on the bayou...  We decided to splurge a little for a special occasion, and I'm glad we did!  Pappadeaux was a really fine evening out with exceptional food, delightful surroundings, and excellent company.  I ordered the lobster despite my inexperience with how to approach it -- our waiter gave me a quick tutorial and I'm so grateful.  My husband ordered Pasta Mardi Gras and loved it - he likes it spicy!  I was glad we left the young 'un home so we could be free and easy on a date night, but we could have brought her as it was kid friendly and she would have enjoyed it.  It was a grand night on the town - we loved the ambiance and the swanky yet unpretentious feel of this place.  Their website says \"Fun, Festive & Always Original\" and I must agree..."}
{"text":"This place is best Seafood restaurant, hands down! 
Servers and staff are very attentive even with a full house. If you are in the area definitely check it out.
I recommend the alligator or frog legs as appetizer.
Our server Ryan M. Was fantabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Always awesome never fails me whenever I'm in the city where one is I am there without a doubt this location tends to be busy on the weekends but the bartenders will still noticed you in passing so no complaints here great food"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful, the atmosphere perfect, and Alex is a sweet and charming waitress."}
{"text":"They were absurdly busy. I had a bar's eye view of the care that goes into the $3.95 1/2 dozen oysters. I would not order them myself. Dinner felt rushed, I didn't feel like a very valued client, and the poor gentleman next to me waited at least 25-30min for his 1/2 dozen oysters (carelessly drained of their delicious fluids).

My dinner was good, but relied heavily on it's fat content to carry it's flavor. My cocktails were good, I would come back for those.

It took another 10min just to pay my tab after I had finished. My dishes were cleaned up by a bartender who looked like he just run a marathon, dripping with sweat. Not exactly how I like to finish my evening.

Thanks, but no thanks Pappadeaux."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux's Pappadeaux is what my family and I chanted following our dinner...its not like a rally chant PA-PA-DEAUXS! It's more of a shake our heads, what have you done to me and why way of saying it. Papa-deaux's Papa-deaux's.
Cocktails are pricey from the regular menu but tasty.  Great combinations that are not  overwhelmed with alcohol  (some may prefer a stronger drink but I'll forgo the \"burn\" with my dinner)
Watermelon mule light and refreshing
The Grand Hennessey definitely on the stronger side but still sweet and flavorful.
Pink Sapphire who knew gin could be so tasty?  I did but it was good to have with dinner while the drink taste also light and....pink.
Crab fingers...EAT THESE sauteed.  The lemon garlic butter sauce theyre sauteed in is  delicious.
Seafood gumbo was bland and watery.
Papadeaux's fried seafood platter was average at best.
They had a parpadelle with Roasted squash, shrimp, scallops and crab meat that was very very good.  Pasta and seafood was fresh and the sauce creamy and garlicky.
The star of the table was my Texas Redfish Pontchartrain, this was my 2nd time having redfish and it did not disappoint.  It's served with a brown butter that I can bathe in and dirty rice (dry).  Not over seasoned fish remained flaky and moist. EAT THIS!"}
{"text":"This place will make you feel like you are in New Orleans. It has jazz on weekends.Fish is always fresh,never frozen at all.enjoy the ambiance,Jazz on weekends.This place is not for crying babies or kids"}
{"text":"Loved it, I can't wait to go back when I'm not on a date so I can make a fool of my self devouring my food in a fashion befitting it's awesomeness. I had fried oysters, and granted you can't mess that up to bad, these were cooked just right (not over done) the baked potato could have been a river boat and was loaded down with all the yummy topping you could wish for. The lobster bisque had nice chunks of lobster in it and it was served with French bread and butter. Now the gumbo was not my favorite all though I was impressed that there were oysters in it. I will also admit I'm from Louisiana and I have a high standard for gumbo as my pawpaw is basically a master at making it. The staff was super friendly. Two request- please get a remoulade sauce, it goes good on everything- and get some family dinning specials. I would love to take my three sons for a meal with out having to sell a kidney."}
{"text":"Food was excellent ambiance was outstanding wait staff...not so much.  Greeters were cool...wait staff...aaaaahhhh...

Get there early to get a spot outside they fill up quick.  Bloody Mary after a night out in Phx was right on point."}
{"text":"I attempted to place an togo order first phone call I held on 12 minutes, second call 4 minutes.  I was informed there was no togo person today. Your menu offers to go ordering. I don't have 16 minutes to waste. I'm done with this company."}
{"text":"Even though it was really super busy and even those very very loud the food was very very good and I had a really good time with my husband on a date and it was very nice to have some down-home south'N N'ORLNs ..."}
{"text":"Contrary to the sign in front, this restaurant serves the worst seafood in the Phx valley.  I took some family members to dinner hear on a sunday evening and the experience was a total fail from the beginning.  Despite a plethora of open tables, we were told we would need to wait at least 15 minutes to be seated.  I think this may have been because we were a mixed race family. Predictably, when we were seated we were given a poorly situated table at the back of the bus.  We demanded and were reluctantly given another nearby table.  That should have been a sign to leave, but we stayed to endure a truly terrible and overpriced meal.  We ordered an appetizer platter to share, and then entrees of stuffed fried crab, stuffed fried shrimp, cajun catfish, and a cesar salad.  The only good thing in the entire meal was the salmon on the appetizer plate.  All the other seafood items were over-salted to the point of being almost inedible.  Two family members complained of feeling uncomfortably bloated after dinner due to the salinity of the food.  YUCKERS!!!  The service hear is also atrocious.  Despite the fact that this is a fairly expensive restaurant, it is completely staffed by inexperienced high school and college students. They even attempted to overcharge us for one of our entrees.  I left a 10% tip, which was in retrospect was way too much. No return trip ever!"}
{"text":"Love this place... The only thing that upsets me is that the portion of the aligator is so small for the price...and no oyster tonight. Not a good night. Darn"}
{"text":"First off, I know I'm going to come off as sounding crazy because it seems like everyone loves this place. I have had 3 separate experiences that just weren't up to par (1st time was a pick-up order & the steak was extremely chewy 2nd time was similar to my experience I had on Sunday.) I went to have dinner with my boyfriend and  we were promptly seated, but that is where the promptness ended. When we finally received our food (both had the seafood sampler for somewhere around $21 per plate) and everything tasted similar without any of the WOW factor I was hoping for. The worst part was when we were done eating the waitress brought us our to-go boxes and then took 30 minutes to bring us the check. We debated on just leaving but decided to be responsible, but lets just say the tip was minimal. Overall this place just wasn't worth my $64 bill at the end of the night. I ended up having a BOMB dinner the next day at Jason's Dell for $20 and I enjoyed it WAY more! nuff said"}
{"text":"Much better than I expected being that it's a chain restaurant. The fried alligator was fun and good especially the curry flavored sauce. My Mahi Alexander was delicious as was my husband's Chilean sea bass. I couldn't finish mine so I asked for it to be boxed while we shared some creme Brule. Unfortunately someone tossed my leftovers but no worries they made me a whole new order and didn't charge me for the first! I didn't even complain just thought I wasn't going home with leftovers no big deal but they just did it. Great aercice5"}
{"text":"great food. :-)"}
{"text":"This is our first of many visits to this excellent Cajun Restaurant. on this trip we got the alligator appetizer,  my wife ordered the seafood platter and I the crayfish platter.

Keep in mind you get a large amount of food for every plate.

Alligators is superb with the perfect amount of tastey spice. Slightly hot but outstanding seasoning. The side sauce is very smokey and pairs perfectly.

The seafood platter was excellent. I ate the crab cake for my wife since it was a bit spicey for her. She loved the fish, shrimp, and the huge baked potato fully loaded. 

Crayfish platter was a huge portion of fried crayfish and a large full serving of crayfish etouffet. Wonderfully seasoned with perfect heat. Amazing food.

Also had the excellent praline pecan cheesecake that surpasses all cheesecakes I gave ever eaten. 

All said and done we had 4 to go boxes that could easily cover two more meals. 

I can not say enough wonderful things. Our waiter was so knowledgeable about every aspect of the food and made our stay outstanding. We asked for the manager to sing his praises. Outstanding guy."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times throughout my life but this past experience is what made me come onto Yelp and make review.. First, the food is great and I am obsessed with the shrimp and crawfish fondue. I have literally come to Pappdeaux and ordered that as my meal! But what really pushed me to do this review was our waitress Jada. I would come in and wait just to sit in her section! She knew the menu, answered our questions fast, my drink never dipped below half full, she was just fun to talk to, and always had a smile! This girl really made the experience just a bit more fun and personal. I'm all about customer service and she was just off the charts."}
{"text":"Love this little Louisiana Fish House ... it rocks you like a Hurricane ... huge menu with plenty of great choices ... a can't miss place for me in Arizona .. try the Captains Hurricane.. the Cajun Pasta and Gumbo are my favs"}

{"text":"Pappadeaux gets my 5 stars ! No wonder the Chilean sea bass is on their menu cover. It is absolutely perfect. The kids had the pasta Mardi Gras and  it was great. Look at it this way, no doggy bag is needed at pappadeaux even though the portions are huge, the food is addictive !"}
{"text":"Amazing food, gorgeous patio, and an authentic atmosphere. My hands down favorite restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Delicious. The Texas red fish never misses. The crab cakes are always awesome. I've been here
Numerous times and the service and staff have always been great."}
{"text":"If you are a Cajun or from New Orleans you will be disappointed. If youre not and are just looking for a casual seafood restaurant with some hints of Nawlins, then you may like this place. The food was good, just not once you've experienced The Big Easy.  I do agree with the other review, it was very loud!"}
{"text":"Great Sea-food with an Outstanding Service Help........."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant more than a few times and am rarely disappointed. 

On most occasions I sit at the bar with one or two friends. They have a great atmosphere, decent happy hour, and well trained bartenders. I have never had a \"slow service' problem eating here, but then again I rarely sit at the tables. 

It gets busy pretty much EVERYDAY not just on weekends so if you are going with a big group or even just a few people and are gonna want a table, I would recommend calling ahead. 

I would have to say their best deal is when their oysters are on sale for something like 4 buck a dozen. They aren't the most premium oysters (out of season) but still pretty good, especially when they are at a bargain price. Try their blue cheese chopped salad its great, they have some kind of special blue cheese dressing that is something to brag about."}
{"text":"The name of our server today was BEN KYLE and his customer service was BAYOU PERFECT! I'm so happy I dropped in, each visit is more special than the one before. I always get more than just a meal... they truly make me feel like home. PS --- I'm from the south, Dallas, TX to be exact. I was raised on Cajun food from the boot (Louisiana). You guys franchise the taste and feeling well. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came here for a farewell lunch for a retiring coworker.. and boy is this place pricy!  Thank goodness I didn't have to pay for her meal, dodge that bullet.

The quality was decent, but still miles from top notch.  The restaurant was pretty clean, and the staff was pretty attentive and annoying.  Service was super slow due to it being so busy, and the parking sucks.  

I wondered why my subordinate did everything to not come here even pretending that he has the stomach flu and that he was stuck in the loo doing a two.  He knows quality and value, I should of known if he doesn't like it, I probably wouldn't either.

Overall an average experience, I don't see a reason for me to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love the dirty rice and the cajun catfish. If it wasn't so far from home I would eat there more often."}
{"text":"Our waiter Marcus was amazing. Worth the 45 min drive.  Save yourself time and make reservations"}
{"text":"We went in for a light dinner and some drinks. It was happy hour, but that never applies to anything we are drinking. Grabbed some lobster bisque, sausage & Seafood gumbo, and a shrimp po'boy. I was kind of in the mood for a half and half (shrimp and oyster) po'boy but that wasn't on the menu. I'm sure they could have done it, but I was honestly too hot and tired to fuss. Tossed back an Abita and a Blanton's bourbon while m' lady sipped her 12 year old single malt.
The prices are steep - so get ready if you aren't having lunch specials or happy hour items."}
{"text":"As someone who HATES Seafood, I am always so scared and hesitant to go to a seafood place. My husband recently celebrated his birthday, and wanted to try Pappadeaux. I agreed because it was his birthday. 

To begin with, our waiter was amazing!!!!! Also, I got a Greek salad with chicken, and Oh Em Gee! The chicken was phenomenal! I have been craving it ever since! 

This review is for anyone that doesn't like seafood! Although most seafood spots don't have very good non seafood options, that is not the case for Pappadeaux! Their food, whether seafood or not, is so good!"}
{"text":"Anniversary Dinner was fantastic!  First time there, I had the sea bass my husband had lobster. We also shared a ceasar salad, gumbo, and smoked salmon. I know it was way too much to eat but so delicious! Our server was Marlin and he was so friendly and informative. Really enjoyed it only complaint was I wish there was some seating a little more private, it was kind of noisy but tha'ts the only complaint I had. We will definately be going back, I never thought I liked salmon but that appetizer was so good I want to try the salmon for dinner. It is a bit pricey, but you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed in the take out service. I called ahead for a noon pickup and didn't get my order till around 12:30. Had to stand leaning on my cane. Not even an offer of water. Wife sat in car waiting in the August heat."}
{"text":"I love seafood and I love Pappadeaux Seafood.  The alligator is to die for and all the fish is fresh and they get it delivered daily (that's what the server told us).  My husband got crawfish etufee and it was delicious.  I got the Salmon alexander with dirty rice and loved it.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sat at the busy bar and ordered dinner.  Service was just passable.  Food was good, but expensive."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant fantastic Cajun style food ! Lobster crawfish oysters alligator pasta and salad for the weak... love the atmosphere  and decor .. service is always on point . Calamari check seafood check service check and decor check ... wow"}
{"text":"Pappa deaux more like Papa-don't. The only reason to come here is the 3.95 dozen oysters. We got here super early on a sunday afternoon (4:30) and the place was still packed for lunch. Service was friendly, kitchen was a little slow, the food was a step above Red Lobster. The stuffed friend shrimp and crab was not really good at all. I guess if you live at least 4 hours a way from fresh ocean this place will have to do."}
{"text":"A wonderful menu full of great seafood options with portions that will leave you full to boot! It's on the expensive side I would say though with a full dinner costing over 100 especially if you want to try something like alligator."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux is overpriced and overrated.  There are so few choices in seafood restaurants in the Phoenix area.  It's a shame.  Franchise.  The food is ok.  One step up from Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Several years ago, when business travel to Houston was regular, I became a big fan of the Pappas family restaurants-- Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen in particular.  As we drove north from Phoenix airport to Sedona I noticed a sign for Pappadeaux, and knew that this would be a lunch stop when the final portion of our vacation brought us back to Phoenix.

The restaurant is large, attractively appointed and comfortable, with an encyclopedic menu of fish and seafood offerings.  Although best known for their Cajun preparations, there are abundant choices for everyone who enjoys well-prepared fish and seafood.

Our server, Nicholaus, effortlessly navigated a crowded lunchtime dining room with our order.  Although a bit distant, he was a consummate professional.

Brought first to the table was a large platter of crispy fried alligator nuggets, served with a full-bodied spicy sauce.  I ordered a platter of fried oysters, one of my favorites, while my family selected po boy sandwiches of shrimp or alligator.  We each had a cup of their Andouille, Crab, and Shrimp Gumbo.  The sandwiches were bountiful, and from what I was told, absolutely delicious.  The same could be said for the fried oysters.  A tartar sauce whose consistency was a bit less obvious as a packaged commercial product is all that separated this lunch from greatness.  The seafood was all fried just to the point of presenting a crispy coating surrounding tender, moist and flavorful protein.

Hardly an inexpensive lunch, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen is in that class of restaurant that I would seek out wherever they operate."}
{"text":"Been here several times and never dissapointed!!!! Foods great, service is amazing!! Wait time can suck but worth the wait"}
{"text":"Not happy with my experience which is weird since I've been here before. This time they just couldn't get things right. Filet over cooked as well as my lobster. By the time they remade the meal I was over it and they still took 20 mins to give me melted butter.  Still had to pay for it all. Will not be coming back. Really upsetting."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux has been around here for a long time.  It is a \"chain\" restaurant with locations in eight states.  I would say it's a high-end cajun seafood restaurant with a substantial menu.  I remember coming here a couple of decades ago, and we finally returned with my family recently.

We got seated at a round table for 5 and our hostess was very gracious and attentive.  After looking at our menu for a while, we opted to get the large order of crispy fried alligator bites.  After a few minutes, we upgraded to the Appetizer Trio, with mini shrimp & crawfish fondeaux (this was EXCELLENT), calamari with octopus and fried alligator.

It was seriously too much food.  After eating our complimentary bread and working our way through the appetizer trio, most of us were already stuffed!  Still, we ordered our main entrees:

 * Pasta Mardi Gras - FANTASTIC...omg
 * Shrimp & Scallop Orecchiette Pasta - WOW, a stunner
 * Kids fried chicken & shrimp plates

Seniors get lunch prices on entress ALL DAY, so my mother took advantage and ordered a sampler platter off the lunch menu.  We verified on the bill and yes, it was the lunch price.

Overall our service and food was excellent.  We paid dearly for it:  bill came to $260 after tip.  That hurts the wallet let me tell you, but the food was really worth it.  I literally had leftovers for three nights in a row!

Will most definitely come back, after I save up for a year or so ;)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing I had the sampler and it had too many things. I loved it and after ordering that I really got to try a lot of things including alligator which I had never tried before. The staff is super nice and very helpful. 
I give it a full 5 stars and recommend this place for when you want to impress someone. The prices are very good for the food your eating. 30 per person."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and our server was wonderful. I wish I remembered her name. We travel over an hour to eat here. Definite favorite."}
{"text":"Called to do call ahead seating was told theuro was no wait and couldn't do call ahead seating, but could change.  Called back 15min later and was told there was a 45 min wait. So why not do the call ahead seating from the begin! !!"}
{"text":"Oh man.  So good.  Went here on my birthday and went all out with the rock lobster and filet combo.  Holy crap!  It is amazing!!  We also had crab cakes as an app. and my boyfriend got the crawfish ettouffe (sp?).  Everything was super yummy, the server was great (Thanks Alex!) and the restaurant ran like a well oiled machine.  Can't wait to go back!!!
PS- get a Bellini!!!"}
{"text":"Well we made the mistake of going here on a Friday night at about 7pm.  This place was packed.  Strange considering the average price of a dinner is around 20 bucks.  But we decided to try anyways.  I have been here before but that was maybe six years ago. 

Upon arrival we went to the hostess table and she told us there would be a two hour wait.  She said that if you wait for a table in the bar you can get one of those tables first come first serve.  So we took a number and hung out in the bar.  About 20 minutes of waiting in the bar we got two seats at the bar.  Lucky.  The bar staff is very friendly and very fast considering this place was absolutely packed!    

We ordered two of the specialty drinks called the swamp thing!   they were damn tasty.  I don't know how much alcohol is in one but that's all I needed for the rest of the night!  We also ordered some fried alligator as an appetizer.  The alligator taste like a  cross of fish with a chicken texture.  It is very tasty! The presentation was also nice not messy or greasy.  We then ordered our dinner.  

She got the Shrimp Etoufee and I got the Pontchartrain Fish.  The shrimp etoufee came in a smoky sauce with dirty rice.  The Pontchartrain was the fish of the day which was tilapia and had shrimp and crab meat in a butter sauce with dirty rice.  The food is outstanding!  Portion size is fantastic and food served hot and fresh.  The fish has no fishy taste or smell to it.  Its as if it came off the boat and served in your plate.  

Overall I say two thumbs way up!  For an expensive dinner this place is worth it.  Date night yes, want to surprise the family with some creole food YES!   

Only thing I would say is that come early and hungry! Also if it is date night the bar is the way to go.  You don't even have to get alcohol you can get a soda and order food."}
{"text":"Seafood was fresh and superb everything was delicious the seafood platter had different tastes and elements that made the food stand out not mediocre at all something very hard to accomplish with fried food. The dessert trio was to die for and the service was excellent. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 5 stars for their customer service. They are wonderful here. I ordered the shrimp and crab cocktail. Didn't really like the cocktail sauce. 

The waitress and her manager apologized, asked if they can bring me something else. Didn't charge me for the food. Made me feel very comfortable and not like an annoying, complaining customer. 

Great service, great restaurant. Will definitely be back. Thank you Lisa and Gianna. You guys are the best!"}
{"text":"Service was nice and friendly but when you order something and ask for it not to be spicy and it come to the table with xtra spicy flavor that is not good. Sent it back to get a one with no spicy seasoning to then get changed for 2 orders for the same thing  request to have a mgr look at the bill and tell me there is nothing wrong with it.  I had to point it out that one should not be charged for an item that was wrong and should not be doubled on the bill."}
{"text":"This place is very busy.  The menu is large.  Ordered their special of the day.  Blackened salmon topped with scallops, shrimp, crawfish, dirty rice.  I asked for the salmon to be medium rare, came medium well.  The shrimp were overcooked.  The scallops, came perfectly, medium rare!  Overall I thought all the food was very bland and did not have a fresh taste.  Seemed like I was eating at a cafeteria.  Kind of reminded me of the New Orleans section at Disneyland...crowded, not much flavor.  We wished we went somewhere else when we were done.  It was someone's birthday, and we did skip the free desert they were offering.  There is plenty of food.  The plates are huge and when the food arrives, it does look small, but really, it is huge.  So you do get well fed.  Parking is great.  Their patio looks great!  The staff was very friendly.  Service was average."}
{"text":"Went to Pappadeaux's last night for our 20th wedding anniversary. Have been here a few times for special occasions. Never have had a problem. But had to write a review about last night. Great service, Tanya (our waitress) was perfect. Her attention to detail and her skill was amazing. Found out after speaking with her that this is her first waitress position. You couldnt tell.  Definitely ask for her if you can. The dining manager Forrest, stopped by to wish us a happy anniversary and comped our dessert for the occasion. Very nice touch. Loved the food, we had alligator and blue point oysters for appetizers, yum, i had the shrimp brochette, husband had the costa rican mahi alexander, all was perfectly seasoned and served hot. This definitely will be a continuing date night spot for us in the future. Truly enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"Went in this past weekend for a group dinner. Our server Marcus was excellent at keeping the table cleared, making recommendations and getting everything we asked for. The food was pretty good, though a couple misses here and there with the various things I tried. Overall it was really good and I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The food was amazing. The flavors and combinations were mouth watering. When we arrived they were pretty crowded but were seated within 15 minutes. Inside was quite busy and crowded and was pretty loud so we opted to sit on the patio. It was beautiful and quiet and our server, Kirk, was outstanding, friendly and helpful and recommended some amazing menu items! My husband ordered the Chilean Seabass which was out of this world, and I had the redfish. Both were very flavorful and not too heavy. Our server recommended the key lime pie which was the best I've ever had. We will definitely come back next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food was exceptional! From the appetizers to the entrées the food was superior. The The calamari was a very interesting blend not too heavily fried the taste was perfect. The crispy salmon dish was probably the best I've ever had. My only feedback for the restaurant was that they were understaffed and the service was of low-quality. 30 minutes for a drink isn't acceptable. This is my first time here so that was rather disappointing other than the service everything else was top notch."}
{"text":"Delicious food, overall great experience. Always greeted with a smile walking in the door. While the kitchen can lag when the restaurant fills up, it is always worth the wait for great food."}
{"text":"Huge restaurant.  Neat atmosphere but pretty noisy.  Portions are gigantic - my wife and I could have easily split the main entrée (and we are both big eaters). I had the Parmesan Crusted Flounder it was really quite good.  My wife the pan seared salmon which she enjoyed as well.  The restaurant turns tables fast - we were in/out in less than an hour.  We didn't feel rushed though - just everything was timed perfectly.  Drinks, salad, entrée and deserts offered.  Note: The deserts looked phenomenal , but we were so stuffed had to pass.  Next time we will split an entrée and save just a little bit of room for desert."}
{"text":"Hands down,  this is the ceasar and emperor of seafood restaurants!  period! i started my delectable journey with pappadeaux's in the early 90's when i used to take business trips to houston,  dallas & austin,  texas. then in 2005, i discovered that they were in phoenix, az. equally as phenomenal!  now, over 5 years later,  i'm back in the phoenix area and of course i have to stop back here! and its just as delicious and phenomenol as ever!  you must order the new salmon & shrimp and the sea bass. they are both off the chain!!!! if eating those dishes were a crime!  it would be a felony! the catfish is omg, so, so, so tender, meaty  and dreamy! I PROMISE ALL YOU NON-SEAFOOD LOVERS THAT YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND FOREVER ABOUT SEAFOOD ONCE YOU'VE DINED HEAR. They Ship in Their Seafood \"DAILY, DAILY, DAILY\"..., Did I Stutter? I've Had 5 Conversions of Clients or Colleagues who Absolutely Hated Fish and Other Seafood,  in My Extensive Dining Experience over the Years, at PAPPADEAUX'S in 2 Atlanta Locations,  Houston, Austin, Phoenix and Denver. IF YOU'RE NOT CONVINCED OR CONVERTED AT THE  END OF YOUR DINING EXPERIENCE THEN YOUR DESTINED TO RECIEVE THE BEST DESSERTS IN THIS UNIVERS!!!,  Not Because Your BEYOND HELP, But If You're a Virgin/1st Timer at PAPPADEAUX'S SEAFOOD KITCHEN, the Management should, at Their Discretion, give You any Dessert on the Dessert  Tray on the House! Especially,  if You Were Too Lame Not to Love the Seafood! BUT I PROMISE THAT YOU WILL BE CONVERTED!  YES, THAT'S THE GOSPEL THAT I'M PREACHING!"}
{"text":"The food is yummy but to greasy  the service is excellent and the restaurant is beautiful!!"}
{"text":"The food here is one of my favorites in Phoenix love it    I ha d the tomato almond arugula salad and fried calamari
The seafood platter is good a little bit dry but good
The lobster is okay 
Mac and cheese for the children okay 
We usually come here to celebrate our family birthdays
Don,t forget dessert crime brûlée so good 
 The service is good"}
{"text":"WOW, I want to go back with some of the 5 star rate people and order what they do as I would have been better off at McD's and saved about $80.00. The only good thing about that place was our waiter who was steller in light of terrible food"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here on our way back from Sedona, because she loves seafood, and this is my mom's favorite place. I got a steak, and it was bomb.

At first, I was a little irritated, because I felt like they walked me to the back corner to seat us in the dine n dasher's room until I realized that the emergency exit was the fastest route to my car, and my girlfriend and i argued about whether an alarm would really sound. She wouldn't let me test it after we paid, but that was cool.

Rio was our server, and he was cool too. He didn't police our table or make me feel like my every move was being watched which is what I'm used to when I go to nice restaurants, so I was happy."}
{"text":"This is my Favorite Restaurant by FAR. There are a few cons in the past 3 visits though.  Food on one hand is always excellent. Service is usually 
really prompt, but if you want optimal service I would eat at the bar.

1. Lobster Sizes. I try to Order 2lbs or So, and every time I have been up-sold to a 3 or 4 pounder without any discount.
2. The Lobster Eat All you Can deal was turning away customers by 7pm on the opening night,, I was showing off and brought 4 guests up from Gilbert, just to get turned away.
3. The Temperature in there is a bit chilly, so if you don't devour your food quickly, it can tend to get a bit cold.

Best Dish Lobster
Best Appetizer P.E.I Mussels
Best Drink Fat tire

On a nice Date, expect to pay about 80 to 100 per couple.."}
{"text":"Ugh....so disappointing.  Went there for with another couple to celebrate his birthday....and well it was probably one of the worst dinning experiences ever!  Our server was horrible...she was pleasant however really should choose a different career path because serving is NOT it.  She was NOT timely with her service, came and took drink order, forgot to bring menus, brought some of the drinks \"oops I forgot his beer\", \"oops forgot your wine\", rushing us to order when we were still waiting on appetizer???  Got tired of waiting for the \"gluten free\" menu, so one of us went looking for one....  But here's the best part, we ordered a salad that two of us were going to share......you'd think - BRING an extra plate when you bring the salad, after all she knew we were sharing......NOPE! No plate..\"can you bring an extra plate, please?\"  \"OK\"........YEAH not sure where she went to find this elusive plate, because it never arrived, we had to share off the same plate .  Oh and if you're gluten free...be ready to be interviewed by a manager regarding your deficiency on gluten....REALLY, we need to discuss the level of allergy?....Gluten free is just that, NO GLUTEN in my food please, not rocket science!  No return visit for us - let corporate know, they said \"oh sorry, here's a gift card so can try us again\".................hmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Service was horrid!  When a party calls with a reservation and you confirm said reservation they should not be told to either sit outside or wait for an additional thirty minutes before being seated.  (This is after a 20 minute wait past the reservation already.)  All food was either overcooked or undercooked.  Some meals were not even brought out until after other party members had already fisnished.  Trying to flag down a waiter for a refill on a water was nearly impossiable.  I realize that it is not the wait staff's fault but rather poor management.  In the future I will stick to a less pricey better tasting cajun option."}
{"text":"Prices during happy hour is decent but the house wines aren't much to brag about.  Spend a little more for the Grey Goose martini.  Hot boiled shrimp with potatoes is the best deal on happy hour.  The portion is big enough to make a meal in itself.  Too bad they don't serve this on the regular menu.  The catfish beignet is also good.  

The quality of fried calamari is better than most places.  Fried alligator is decent.  And spend a little more for the blue point oysters.  They're huge and tasty.  I've had the mahi mahi alexander, grilled shrimp and andouille sausage.  The latter isn't all healthy but delicious. 

Don't get the fish fry or filet steak.  I'm picky about fish fry.  In my lifetime, I've only found 2 places that makes really good fish fry.  One in northwest Phoenix and the other in North Carolina lol.  Granted fish fry isn't all that healthy, but I want to be able to see the fish, not taste all the batter and grease.  The filet was overpriced and more fatty like a ribeye. Go to a steakhouse instead. 

Oh, lets not forget about dessert.  Creme brulee is usually my favorite dessert, it's light.  They now have the Andes mint cheesecake.  The best of both worlds.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"An old favorite. Love the boudin and the wide selection of fish and Cajun-style entrees. A bit heavy on fried food... and so I can't get my wife to return. But I would on a business lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We left town early enough to make it here before closing.  It's our favorite place for fresh fish.  Every time we come, regardless of the season, the food is always top notch.  The service is just as good as the food and tonight was no exception. 

For months we have been waiting for this trip, knowing we would be eating here made the planning even more exciting, and we finally got our most favorite desert, the carrot cake cheesecake.  We had tried this a long time ago and been waiting for it to come back on the menu and we were lucky enough tonight.   

We love this place so much, we always end up buying gift cards for family members to enjoy it too!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time at Pappadeaux's!   The service was fantastic. Esther was amazing. We dined from 1:00 to 4:00. Never felt rushed or encouraged to move to the next course. We began the meal with a smooth bottle of merlot from Chile. We enjoyed oysters for an appetizer. My Mom had lobster bisque and said it was very good. A soft and warm loaf of bread was also served. My parents had the two pound lobsters and my husband and I feasted on the crab legs. Everything was cooked perfectly and it made for an extraordinary meal. This is the second year we have celebrated my birthday and Anniversary at this restaurant. It is always a memorable celebration."}
{"text":"I got my much needed crawfish Étouffée! Boy was it good! Noisy and busy for a Sunday afternoon but very much welcomed! No need to be quiet here! Seated in five min drink order taken as well as the alligator appetizer! The larger pieces were a bit tough but delicious! The water came first but the bar must have been backed up because it took some time for the Wine and beer to come out. Moving on to the entrees-to die for Crawfish Étouffée done to perfection, tried a good portion on the halibut (let me just say (SUCCULENT). Pricey but oh so worth it! Service was great you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Pricey but worth it. Try the lobster bisque it's to die for!"}
{"text":"Lovely tomato salad with lump crab meat enough for a meal by itself, mussels are great as an app! Good food and consistent."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm once again a fan of Pappadeaux.  Sweet hubby picked up some to-go a couple weekends ago and they are back in the game.  The food was MUCH better than our miserable experience in March.  He enjoyed the shrimp po' boy and seafood gumbo (he kindly gave me some of the gumbo, including a gigantic oyster, which I thoroughly enjoyed).  I ordered the lunch Blackened Catfish with Shrimp Etouffee Pistolette and Dirty Rice.  The catfish was sweet and tender and oh so yummy.  The Shrimp Etouffee Pistolette was a dish of their outstanding Etouffee with a hunk of French bread so decadent, I think they actually dunked it in melted butter and then deep fried it (Texas State Fair anyone?).  I saved some of the Etouffee and cooked plain wild rice to go with it for lunch on Monday.  The dirty rice was once again delicious, so happy they use ground chicken livers, as it should be."}
{"text":"Great food & service is hit or miss but overall it's very decent.  The pasta & seafood dishes are delicious everything we've tried we've been satisfied."}
{"text":"The best place in Arizona for fresh seafood. I've been to places in Scottsdale and just big prices without the freshness and quality.  This is my top pic for lobster, crab and fish."}
{"text":"Update!!!! so upper management reached out to me after reading my review. We spoke and they were very helpful and expressed concern about the situation that occurred. I'm really glad that someone at the corporate office took the time to do so. I will not let this experience ruin the brand name for me and will visit other locations 



. Ok Yelpers by far this is the worst pappadeux I've ever been to! The waiter we had was horrible the food was cold. I just can believe that I'm writing a bad review. The service was so bad that we did a FIRST, ZERO TIP... Let me explain. My moms order was totally wrong.  She ordered catfish and got crawfish yes they both start w a \"C\" but she also said blackened so that should've said she wasn't saying crawfish. Ok skip the fact that we were never asked if we wanted drinks or appetizers, he just bought us water. Then after eating COLD food we asked for to go boxes. Waite boxed our food and just scrapped everything off the plate including garnishes into the to go box, mixed all the food together. I'm talking catfish tomato shrimp and rice and everything all together and basically said \"HERE\" don't ask me what my waiter looked like bc he didn't spend more than 5 min total at our table. Maybe it was my waiter but ILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT (in Phoenix) EVER!"}
{"text":"We try to avoid chains when we travel but there were very few restaurants in the vicinity of our hotel except this one. We were well pleased with the food and the service of this place. It had the feel of a mom and pop and we had a good waiter. We had shrimp and fish dishes that were very good."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner and wasn't disappointed! I have always been a fan of seafood, and they do it right at Pappadeaux.

If you're into oysters I would highly recommend the gulf coast oyster platter on the half shell. So delicious. I could eat those things for breakfast, lunch and dinner for life!

The seafood gumbo was tasty and they didn't skimp on the seafood.

The Pappadeaux Platter was a huge plate of various fried seafood on a bed of french fries. I would have rather have more seafood and less fries, but that's life. 

I'll be back to celebrate special occasions."}
{"text":"Picked up a shrimp and catfish po boy and for $20, I wasn't impressed at all. I never had a po boy with cocktail and tartar sauce but you needed both to get any flavor out of the sandwich. The shrimp and catfish on their own we're lacking, like they didn't season anything. And no tomatoes either! Come on. I would hope their other food tastes better if I go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in for dinner and had a great time! The hostess' were all very friendly and our server Kim was wonderful! She offered us the alligator appetizer right away which is very tasty and helped us decide on our entrees, she was very animated and really knew her stuff. The food was delicious and overall we had the best night! Thank you Kim and the rest of the team!"}
{"text":"So good.  But, be warned - it's expensive!  Four entrees, two appetizers and a couple of beers totaled nearly $180.00.  Our server, while a bit confused, was charming and likeable.  The food was delicious.  We tried the fried alligator (a first for me) and I'm hooked.  I also got a tilapia fillet that was cooked perfectly with a delicious sauce and side dishes.  I'll go back, just maybe not while we're still in a recession."}
{"text":"I told myself I would Yelp on every restaurant that I ate at on the course of this \"road trip\" I'm taking, so here goes.  We started off in the familiar territory of Phoenix, AZ.  Our \"go to\" spot in the northern suburbs of Phoenix used to be the Fish Market in Scottsdale, but since it \"changed hands\" so to speak, we've been on the look out for another destination.  Well... I think we found it in Pappadeaux.

Service:  5/5

The service we received at Pappadeaux was outstanding from the moment we arrived until the moment we left.  It was about 7:30 on a Friday evening when we got to the restaurant, and since we had been traveling, I did not have the opportunity to make reservations ahead of time.  The parking lot was VERY crowded and we were afraid of a long wait time.  But we were quoted 5-10 minutes when we arrived, and were seated after 7 minutes.  We got one of the few booths in the restaurant near the bar area.

Our waiter, Nate, was very attentive and helpful.  He pointed out some of their more famous dishes and the specials, some of which we ended up ordering.  He was prompt in refilling our water glasses when needed and even stopped a moment to chat with us about our 4-month old son.  The only small blemish I would mention is that dessert was a long time in coming.  It took about ten minutes after we ordered it.  Now I know they don't bake cheesecakes on the fly, so I'm unsure about the reason for the delay, but I thought in the interest of being complete that I would mention it.

Food:  5/5

Absolutely no complaints here.  Everything we ordered was outstanding.  My wife and I got the baked oyster trio and split a Greek salad for appetizers.  The salad was great and so were the oysters.  The salad is served table-side for that extra little touch.  If we were to order again though, I think we would have just gotten a full order of the Parmesan baked oysters instead of the trio.

For entrees, I ordered the special of the evening which was Salmon Diablo, a blackened salmon fillet with extra kick.  The only very minor complaint I would note is the sauce was a bit too much.  It was absolutely delicious, a mix of crab meat and butter and cream, but it overpowered the fish to a degree.  I ended up eating it separately.   As I said, delicious, but a bit much.  My wife ordered the lobster bisque and it was every bit as good as other reviewers have commented.

For dessert we split a carrot cake cheesecake.  I'm always on the look out for new and interesting desserts, and while I have had tons of cheesecakes, this was a combination I hadn't encountered before, so I had to give it a try.  The sweet potato pie also looked interesting, but we went with the cheesecake.  Aside from the delay mentioned above, no complaints here.  The cake was moist, flavorful, and delicious.

Overall Impressions:  5/5

The environment at Pappadeaux is exactly what you would expect.  They do a good job of bringing in that Cajun/creole atmosphere and balance an upscale look with a \"down home\" attitude.  You'll feel right at home here in your t-shirt and jeans, or in your business attire after a long day at the office.  The staff is very helpful and accommodating.  

Overall if you are looking for a seafood or creole meal in the Phoenix area, I can heartily recommend Pappadeaux."}
{"text":"This place has the best food! It is a little pricey but so worth it! I recommend this place to all those who love sea food! They have a variety of dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"Good food.  Whenever I want a special meal, especially seafood, I go here.   They make a mean sea bass and you can't go wrong with the gumbo.  Can get a bit crowded on Friday and Sat nights.  Oh and the oysters rock!   If your an oyster fan."}
{"text":"So for my Dad's birthday dinner I decided to show him one of my favorite places to go around the valley.  

So we had a reservation at 7:30 and got there around 7:10 which was fine we got to sit outside and enjoy the weather which is awesome this time of year.  At 7:35 we were called to our table.  We already saw the menu outside so we were ready to order once seated.  

My dad got the stuffed lobster and I got the Chilean sea bass.  After about 20 min the manager came over and apologized for the wait which I wasn't even concerned about yet.  She said they overcooked the sea bass the first time so they had to re-fire it.  They brought our dishes out about 5 min later.  Everything was good as always and then about 7 min later she brings over this huge piece of sea bass and said again she was sorry.  

I was amazed as I was not worried about anything and didn't even get upset for the overcooking the first time.  She also said she was going to comp a dessert for me which worked out great cause it was my Dad's bday so she brought a special creme brulee at the end of the meal with a candle and happy birthday written in chocolate which was just perfect.  

I love this place and it brings me back to New Orleans every time I go which is a great place to be reminded of."}
{"text":"Love Pappadeaux!!! I really love the atmosphere here and the decor. It's usually packed here which I don't really care for but that means it's a yummy good place. They have amazing appetizers, the creamy dip and alligator! They have some yummy seafood entrées. Although I do wish they had more crawfish options. I love coming here."}
{"text":"The salmon was raw on the inside and cool when brought to the table.   Very  overpriced for the quality and lack of service."}
{"text":"I remember coming here often with my dad when I lived in the West valley. Haven't been in at least 5-6 years. Food was decent but service needs serious improvement. We had a group of 8 and our tab was over $500 and only had one server. She didn't know the menu well enough to answer our questions. We ordered appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I don't think we ever had a busser come by once. So there was empty dirty dishes that just sat there the whole wall. I can see maybe how everything was on the server and she was just busy. But overhearing the table of another 6-8 people next to us and how their orders were lost makes me believe this was our servers first serving job. 
Last thing I didn't notice until after. 
Husband and I ordered Arnold palmers for our drinks. It was never disclosed refills were NOT free. If we knew that, we probably would have stuck to waters. Overall bad bad experience and don't plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love Pappadeaux. I've been going to Pappadeaux for over ten years starting in Houston. When they opened up the one in Phoenix, I was sooo ecstatic! Seafood in Arizona! And I don't have to drive 40 min to Scottsdale to enjoy it!

Before I gush, I will say that I have received some crappy service. When it's bad, you have to make sure you get your waiter to bring you everything you need at once, otherwise it may take a while to track him or her down. Usually these are the times when the place is really busy so I guess I can't get too mad. For the most part though, the waiters know the menu, can offer some good suggestions and come back often for refills.
 
OK, now for some love. Seriously, Love love LOVE when it's $3.95/per dozen oyster time. You do have to make sure it's the right time of the season otherwise you can get some measly oysters. But 99% of the time the oysters are incredibly tasty and fresh. For the person complaining about slow oyster service, they shuck their oysters when you order them. So when they've got 8 orders, there is going to be a wait. I don't know what oysters you're used to eating, but I know shucking oysters is not easy. (Plus you're doing all that work and you don't get to eat them! That would be torture for me!)

I've had a lot of the main fish entrees and they've all been very yummy. It is really pricey, but one entree at Pappadeaux's can last me 2, maybe even 3 meals. It's the damn butter! It fills me up! Butter, you ask? YES! Pappadeaux has the most taste bud pleasing, whipped, salted butter that I have ever eaten. It helps polish down that loaf of freshly toasted french bread that impedes entree eating time.

Fave dessert is the creme brulee for sure. Best way to end the meal. How I have ever had room for dessert, though, is beyond me. Dang butter.

Other dishes I recommend: Calamari, alligator, Greek salad, crawfish etoufee (!!!), soft shelled crab (broiled and fried, ask to go easy on the salt), crawfish gumbo (they only have seafood gumbo listed, but you can ask to have crawfish only)"}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I've been here with my family. Obviously I can't have much here because I'm a vegetarian. But oh my goodness. my family rage about this place like nobody's business. Gator to calamari to the steak. But i... I get mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. Haha"}
{"text":"I fail to see the value in this restaurant.  Management seems unable to figure out how to schedule wait staff.  On a recent coerced visit there were 40 - 50 people waiting outside to be seated in an empty restaurant.  We were told the servers weren't scheduled to start for another half-hour.  How absurd!  The responsible manager should have been terminated immediately.

Prices are extremely high for the quality and quantity of food served.  Simply put, this is a chain restaurant that is trying to be upscale; and failing miserably. Service is slow, the wait staff have way too many tables; the bartenders are Chili/Applebee quality but with upscale bar pricing.

The recent salmonella episode at the restaurant adds to my \"never again\" attitude.

Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"It's rare that Phoenix has a great restaurant that California does not have.  Phoenix always seems to be the step-child in terms of cuisine when it comes to dining in the southwest compared to California.

So it's quite nice that we have Pappadeaux locally to enjoy some southern food.  We first came to Pappadeaux 10 years ago for fresh gulf oysters, when a friend introduced Pappadeaux to us.

We keep going back for the live crawfish during the spring.  The prices have gone up since we first found this place 10 years ago, but it's so worth it for the best live crawfish in the west coast.

We come here for special events, like birthdays, celebrations, etc.  The ambiance is fantastic, the service is great, and the food is delicious.  The prices are on the higher side so expect to shell out more, but it's worth the cost for special occasions and live crawfish!

This place gets busy during Spring training, nice winter months, and weekends, so make a reservation or you may be waiting for a while for seating.

The only negative is we now have to wait until next spring for the crawfish again, that is a long wait!!"}
{"text":"I was here a couple of weeks ago and has the lobster and shrimp salad with mango, avocado and cashews. DELICIOUS! Lots off shrimp and lobster.  Really wonderful. 

I'm back today on my own dime. I ordered the same thing. Still delicIous. Really. Also ordered mushroom risotto. Very good. 

Service by Marlin was excellent, attentive and quick. 

My only real complaint is the noise. At 4pm the place is not full and it is NOISY. OH, and whoever brought the child/baby/demon who let out several ear splitting, blood curdling screams.... Thank God I'm not you. 

Yeah, the place is expensive. I'm worth it. The calories, oh the calories. I'll be back in January for my birthday. I hope to be thinner by then and can afford the calories.  Three months away, I can do it... Maybe. I shouldn't have ordered the banana pudding in the mason jar.  It is DELICIOUS. And I got the lid and I'm taking most of it home.  If I was good, I'd give the leftovers away. I'm not that good a person or dieter."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Valentine's Day. Of course there were a lot of people so our wait time was about 45 mins. While waiting I had a swamp thing from the bar..that drink was so good. We were called in about exactly 45 minutes and it was definitely worth the wait. The food was fantastic. I ordered the Pasta Mardi Gras. It was a large portion so it was enough for 2 people. Our waiter was very friendly and he gave me some beads in celebration of Mardi Gras. I hope to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I like Pappadeaux and find myself there about once every 3 months.

Their live Maine lobster - steamed, please - is usually worth the trip. I have to say that it is inconsistent in preparation. Sometimes it's a bit mealy. Still, this hasn't stopped me from coming back again and again.

Every time I come, I know I'm going to put up with a wait. During that wait, I study the menu and try to convince myself to try something other than their lobster. So far, the fact that the lobster is a great price-point, and I know it's pretty good for the money, I haven't ever tried anything else.

Clearly this place knows what they are doing. They are packed night after night and have been for years. That says a lot."}
{"text":"3.5 years in the Phoenix area, and I had never been to Pappadeaux.  WTF was I thinking?  Seriously!  WTF?  I would soon find out that I was missing out....big time!

My buddy was out for Spring Training, and I had decided that we would finally try this place out.  We arrived around 11:30am and were seated at a table right away.  We ordered our drinks and some appetizers (alligator, and boudin) , then browsed the menu for a bit.  I had an idea of what I was going to get, but there were SO MANY delicious sounding items, it was hard to pick.  I made up my mind though and placed my order for the lunch sized portion of the crawfish combination.  While waiting for our food, our waitress delivered a loaf of French bread and some butter.  Here is how everything was...............

Alligator-  I had only had alligator once before (Dragos in New Orleans), and thought it was delicious.  Somewhat of a chicken texture, but a tad more chewy.  When we went to order the alligator appetizer, our waitress informed us that there was an option for it to be grilled, also (the menu only offers the fried option).  We decided to go with a large order and went half grilled, half fried.  It was a damn fine recommendation by our waitress.  The fried portion was crispy and chewy and had great flavor.  The star of the show though, was the grilled!  It was blackened in a great seasoning, and had great texture.  It comes with some \"alligator sauce\", and a few dips into that, put my mouth in heaven!  Both my buddy and I liked the grilled a little more than the fried.  Both choices were freaking delicious though!  Can't go wrong with either option!

Boudin- Boudin is a Cajun sausage stuffed with a dirty rice type mixture.  This appetizer came with 2 links on top of a pile of rice.  The casings that they use and pretty strong and somewhat hard to cut.  I pretty much split mine down the middle and just ate the \"guts\" of the sausage.  It definitely had a different texture/taste.  Reminded me of a \"white hot\", almost.  It was tasty, but not sure if I would crave it or get it again.  

Crawfish Combination-  This was my entree, and it was damn tasty!  This mountain of a plate came with a massive pile of dirty rice topped with crawfish etouffee, and a massive pile of fried crawfish.  This entree should be split by 2 people.  One man should not try to tackle this thing on its own.  And this was a \"lunch\" portion.  Can't even imagine how big the \"dinner\" portion is.  The fried crawfish were breaded and seasoned perfectly!  I kept popping nugget, after nugget into my mouth and could not stop eating them!  The etouffee part of the entree was delicious as well!  It was a thick gravy filled with tons of pieces of crawfish, layered over dirty rice.  I am not the biggest rice fan, but this rice was awesome!  I ate until I could not eat anymore, and there was still about half of the etouffee left.  Got it boxed up and gave it to a homeless lady on our drive home.

My buddy went with the Cajun Combo (catfish and shrimp Creole).  He let me try some of his blackened catfish (biggest filet of catfish I have ever seen!) and it was delicious!  The shrimp creole was a bit skimp though.  It was mainly veggies and very few shrimp.  Total opposite of my crawfish etouffee (overflowing with crawfish).

After we gorged ourselves silly, we still went with some dessert.  My buddy loves key lime pie, so we went with a slice of that.  Holy hell!  Delicious!  HUGE piece of key lime pie.  Great graham cracker crust, perfectly chilled filling and it was topped with berries and puree etc.  It was a great piece of pie!  (It was comped off the bill, too.  Read other reviews of people getting a free dessert if it is your first time dining here...not sure if that is true or not, but it makes sense.  And, that is freaking awesome if that is why!)

Overall, it was a great lunch!  Pricey, yes, but that french bread, alligator, boudin, crawfish combination and key lime pie were all fantastic!  Pair that with great service, great company, and an awesome setting (the restaurant is beautiful!), it justifies the price, somewhat.  Can't eat here every day, but for special occasions or a few times a year, this may be my new \"go to spot\" in Phoenix.  It wasn't just the best meal of the weekend, it may have been one of the best meals I have had since being in Phoenix!  It was awesome and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hey now, you can't go wrong with Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen and their friendly staff.
Even thought some of their items are overpriced I love coming here once or twice a year.
Not the best seafood place in town but still better than  most!!!
Worth the visit and $100 for a party of two.
Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Arrived on time for our 8pm reservation (party of 5)
Came here for a 60th birthday dinner.. it was my first time here and it was absolutely amazing! Our server was obviously very busy but extremely friendly and very knowledgeable about everything in the menu. We had a few bumps throughout our dinner because of the computer system and another because the wrong dinner entrée was brought but the manager Melissa made everything right and had the correct meal out asap! She absolutely made our night. Thank you for the great server from your staff and your management.. we will be back!!"}
{"text":"The food here is expensive but really good. I especially love the alligator bites appetizer that they offer. We were seated within two minutes of coming into the restaurant and already had our drinks within five. I do plan on going back but with my budget, I have to say this will be a once or twice a year place for me to visit. I definitely recommended though because it has some of the best seafood in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Excellent except expensive.  People jumping out of line and grabbing open tables was common on the patio. Pissed me off, since wife, son and I waited about an hour and then watched as some smug entitled asshats grabbed a table before it was cleared."}
{"text":"When I want to get my fix for oysters on the half I come here...you can't beat the price!!  Usually between $4 and $6 a dozen depending on specials they have going on.   They also have one of my favorite happy hours with some limited drink specials but some nice food specials served at the bar. 
When I am looking to order a meal I have to say my favorite on the menu is the shrimp brochette (large shrimp stuffed with jalapenos and jack cheese wrapped in bacon and grilled).  I while not bad, opt out of the dirty rice that is served with this dish and have them sub with asparagus or the steamed veggies.   I have had a few other things from the menu like the mixed grill and their cedar plank salmon, and once did the all you can eat lobster special they were running once.   Honestly I have yet to be disapointed by most Pappadeaux's I visit (except the one that was out of oysters)."}
{"text":"Have been to this chain many times before this particular store it's further away from my home then I usually travel however my friend insisted we go. We arrived early for a Friday evening about 5:30 PM and scored a booth in the bar area service was extremely attentive and food was fantastic ! We had raw oysters  and shrimp on a stick  for appetizers ...( shrimp however, was  lightly breaded ) tasty but I normally do not eat fried...

For My mail course  which  I always take at least half home and in this case probably three quarters as it was a lot of food I had  the halibut with brussels sprouts and it was melting in my mouth fantastic! 

They have a great happy hour beverage selection and a few good appetizers but a lot of it is fried. 

I'm usually into quality not necessarily quantity however pappadeaux's  provide both I would certainly return. 

Seafood in the desert is hard to find but this chain restaurant gets it right!"}
{"text":"Deliciously tasting entrees with great portions. The price is on point for the quality you get. The server was amazing!!!! Honestly she was the best part of our entire visit. (I forgot her name but she had super short red hair and told us about her twins). 

Ambiance - is nice but too loud. 

Parking - plenty of space. 

Decor - beautiful restaurant for its kind. 

Menu - there's a variety of options but not overwhelming. 

Overall, every dish we ordered was cooked to perfection. 

One time stop, though. (We're from CA)."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. The alligator appetizer is so good. Probably my favorite menu item! I've tried the frog legs and they were good as well, I haven't had something that I didn't like so far! Friendly staff and prompt service. One of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was Delish and waitress was nice. It took forever to get my food and or if you don't ask for bread you won't get any before your meal."}
{"text":"Great food but had some issues with being told they were out of the selection after order went to kitchen.  But manager really went the extra mile to correct things.  Would go back.  Very fresh fish."}
{"text":"I love going here.  The staff is always friendly and helpful even when the place is packed (which is often).  The food is always good.  Fresh seafood is actually fresh and not frozen.  The drinks are good and not watered down.  I love coming here for special occasions."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating at Pappadeaux and I have to say that I was equally impressed as the first time.  The service was excellent both times and the food is pretty good too!  I had the Shrimp Etouffe the first time and it was an excellent choice and the second time I had the fried shrimp with a side of the Seafood Gumbo.  I really liked the fried shrimp but didn't really care for the Seafood Gumbo, it just totally fell below my expectations (it was chunky and bland) but I was so impressed with the rest of my food that it didn't take away from my overall experience.  We also had the Crab Spinach Dip...yummy!!"}
{"text":"Though it is a wonderful venue, I can't lie about the overall quality of the food. Caveat: the Oysters are WONDERFUL (and probably the best thing about the food, but, really you can't fuck oysters up too much if they are fresh shucked...). I also admit, the service was very good, maybe I would add another star for that EXCEPT that the rest of the menu is just plain farce. Poop. Supposed classic dishes like crayfish ettoufee, poop. Crabcakes, poop. I watched my father suffer through a horrible dish of frozen mussels thinking it was good because he didn't know any better. The prices are not nearly worth it. I would go back for a cold beer and oysters, but not for anything else."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were wandering around on a late Friday night looking for something to eat.  Didn't see a lot of options so we drove to this place just looking for some appetizers.  Everything on menu looked good so we ended up ordering the appetizer trio, seared ahi tuna, and some alligator meat.  The ahi tuna was very tasty and definitely my favorite dish of the night.  The alligator meat was a bit on the chewy side, but not too bad.  I would skip it next time around though.  

The service here on a busy Friday night was still great!  So glad we found this place and was able to eat right away."}
{"text":"if you like cajun food this is the place to go. they have a wide variety of everything.  service is always good.  if you are planning a large party call ahead, getting a table is always going to be a wait. all the times i've gone, i've never waited less than 30 minutes to be seated so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Amazing food , friendly  staff , and the menu always has scrumptious  changes every time  I've been there... mostly when PPL  visit from out of town , or a celebratory date night"}
{"text":"You shouldn't have to wait 30 minutes for a table when there is no waitlist.

The Boy and I were in the neighborhood on Friday and he had raved how much he loves the seafood here. Me? Never been but always game for good seafood.

We walked in at 9 PM and were told it would be a minute for them to clean a table for us but the hostess gave us a buzzer and we headed to the bar. The bartenders were polite but were more concerned with interacting with themselves, talking smack about football teams and \"Woo Boys Rick Flair\" than interacting with us.

Twenty minutes at the bar and I notice a couple walk in and be seated. Then a group of four walks in and is seated. After a couple walked in and was seated, The Boy walked over and asks about our buzzer and how we saw other tables being seated but not ours. No apology from the male host, just \"umm we can seat you now\".

Our server Nick continued with the poor experience. He was either new, in the weeds, or honestly did not care about our table. Every time he stopped at our table he was two steps past us on to the next table before we could answer. He stopped to check on how our food was and was taking the table behind ours margarita order before either of us could speak. He also floundered when describing the two dishes I was on the fence about. He described the Texas Redfish Pontchartrain as \"tasting more like fish\" than the shrimp and scallop dish but did slightly rebound with the description of the Shrimp & Scallop Orecchiette Pasta, which I ultimately ordered. I do give him props for not pushing the more expensive dish, which often happens with servers who only want to upsell. 

Other table around us received a crusty loaf of bread and butter before their entrees.  I even heard another server rave about how everyone loves their french loaf but none was offered to us or even mentioned.

The food itself was very good. The Boy got the Pasta Mardi Gras and loved it. The portion was huge and The Boy loved the spices and the mix of seafood and Andouille sausage.  He was head over heals for the Cheese Grits Andouille & Corn.  
I started with the Cesar salad which was very good. I ordered the above mentioned Orecchiette pasta which was also very good but was disappointed by the amount of shrimp and scallops in the dish. The dish had 3, ok sized shrimp, and 4 mediumish scallops.. 

Although our experience was disappointing, I watched the tables around us and was impressed by the service.  Servers and bussers worked as a cohesive team while the servers themselves gave exceptional service and attention to their tables.

Will our meh experience cloud us from coming back? I can't say since we don't live in the area but I can say I would be back in a heartbeat if we has the experience everyone else around us had."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!!! The food is fantastic and atmosphere so enjoyable and entertaining.  Wish so bad they had one on our side of town. The bomb"}
{"text":"We always come to Papadeaux when we come to Phoenix! The fried shrimp and catfish is my go too! I have tried several things here and they have all been tasty but there is something about the simplicity of fried shrimp and catfish that just makes me happy! :) The portions are large there's always good food. It's hard to save room for dessert so we ordered it to go. Definitely get the banana pudding. When you order it to go they just put the whole mason jar in the to go box and give it to you!"}
{"text":"There was a 7lb lobster in the tank! OMG! We only get to Pappas once a year so we definitely ate a lot of food. During happy hour i had a delicious cocktail, the cajun fonduex, and the gator. I was full before i even ordered the entree but, i still got one anyway. We ordered the Hudson Platter, The Shrimp Brochette and the fried catfish. Everyone loved the shrimp but i thought it was too cheesy, and i love cheese. The fried fish and hudson platter were the bomb, especially cold the next day. I can't wait to return next year!"}
{"text":"This place is always a return for me whenever I'm in town. I have to say, I'm never one to really like chain restaurants, but this is an exception! 

The food is generally really good and portions are just enormous. I like this place cuz of the oysters. Was a little disappointed that they didn't have the Blue Point, but for $5.99 a dozen for the Texas Gulf Coast was a score. The gumbo is always tasty. If you feel like sharing among others, order the Jumbo size that's not on the menu! The Greek salad was a good touch to all the heavy food that is served there too. 

One side note for the bartender. When serving a shot of whiskey or anything else, please don't add crushed ice. It sorta ruins the drink. I'm just saying. You don't serve whiskey with crushed ice. 

Bottom line: repeat for sure!"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent Cajun seafood and meats. I've been there about 12 times. The dinner salad is made at the table now and tastes crisp and fresh. Hot homemade bread served at table. The seafood is prepared to perfection and if dissatisfied no fuss returning it. I have not had any problems in that regard. The halibut is fabulous. Don't forget dessert if you're still hungry.
Get there early. For lunch before 11 AM. For dinner before 5 PM if possible. There is always a wait in the evening. 
Downside: acoustics are poor. If you plan to visit, by 6 PM it's hard to hear your guests. 
Give it a try. Highly recommended. I don't know of any other place in Phoenix that serves comparable food selections like Pappydeauxs."}
{"text":"Okay so we had our valentine's dinner here and it was amazing from the parking lot to the live entertainment outside while you wait on your table. Once we got inside I was completely taken by the atmosphere the linen was perfect the decor was warm and welcoming I was definitely impressed. Our drinks where delicious the food was outstanding and this is coming from someone who is not a seafood lover. What a memorable experience. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"A must for a sea food lover. Very nice place to take a date. Food is awesome and the people are nice."}
{"text":"We liked the ambiance, the service, food however was disappointing. I ordered their special dish Ahi Tuna with Jumbo Lump crab at $31.95 for the plate. There was just a smear of crab that is not even visible to the naked eye. See for yourself."}
{"text":"The best seafood restaurant in the valley. The food is so fresh and tasty. It melts in your mouth. I think this gonna be my favorite restaurant in Phoenix area despite the high prices!"}
{"text":"Its a good franchise with great Cajun cuisine, a fancy atmosphere, a bit pricey if you are in a budget but so good. I recommend trying the blackened alligator. Woooooweeee"}
{"text":"I love me some Pappadeaux!  We actually drove out from Los Angeles to Phoenix to get our cravings satisfied and we were not disappointed.  I'm a huge fan of the Shrimp Etouffee and my mom loves the Crab Fingers.  Shoot, everything is pretty good at Pappadeaux!  I wish they could quit playing and drop a location in the heart of LA."}
{"text":"Yummy...Seafood.. This place has both seafood from the west coast and east coast..


I love their selections.. Their shrimp and lobster salad looked succulent and their Cajun gumbo was to die for..  

This is the real deal if you want to eat a seafood restaurant.. Hands down one of the best seafood restaurants I have been too in a long time...

Wonderful very bright atmosphere makes you feel like your on island in the middle of the desert...hehe"}
{"text":"The service is great, but the food is just eh.
I was expecting a lot of flavors, but my food was really bland.
The only thing I would go back for is the alligator."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a Thursday night. I had a swamp thing and my girlfriend had a beer. The swamp thing is one of my favorite beverages. We ordered the giant shrimp and grits and the salmon Alexander. My shrimp and grits were fantastic but the side of spinach was cold. Her salmon dish was also good by the dirty rice was cold."}
{"text":"It was our first time dining at this restaurant, and we will definitely be back! The atmosphere was fantastic, and service was perfect. The food was absolutely delicious. We had the lobster and the muscles. 
Paul was our server and he rocked it! Personable, very friendly, and checked in just the right amount of times. Thanks Paul!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and I will be back!  The fried alligator was fantastic, crabs cakes were the bomb!  For the entrees I had fried shrimp and fries and the other 2 in my party ordered bass stuffed with crab & scallops and pea risotto.    The signature cocktails are yummy!"}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. 
The Waitress Carla was so short with us, was slow, ignored us and didn't even offer bread. 
I know this isn't the standard because every other waiter/waitress was friendly and upbeat. 
I wanted to order a whole meal but couldn't fathom waisting another minute with Carla. 
This was my first time coming here. 
Also there was a piece of lobster shell in my bisque as well as a hair in my water. I didn't complain to the manager but I should have. Never again. Steer clear of Carla who is an older woman  with glasses and bad attitude. Not to mention it was our Anniversary!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Pappadeaux's! They have amazing food and great service. We always have great waiters!"}
{"text":"Amazing food drinks and atmosphere.  bites are really good, I love the trout when it's in season. Love the ambiance."}
{"text":"Love the food great service however when we asked for to go boxes our server took our food in the back for about 10 minutes and then returned without food I did not like that it make me nervous"}
{"text":"I cannot believe these prices for what you get. Pappadeaux offers a lot of food for amazing prices. I got the Salmon Alexander which was some of the best blackened salmon I have had and the other person ordered the grilled seafood which were two large kabobs of salmon and veggies. I recommend coming here if passing through or staying in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow!! This restaurant is amazing! The Chilean sea bass is to die for! Great food a little on the pricey side but definitely well worth what you pay for! The service is great but short handed. But I will definitely be back, great ambience!"}
{"text":"My family ate here on Christmas eve.  The pros: crawfish bisque was excellent, the serve was great, the deserts were very good - large portions.  The cons: my Crawfish platter which included both Etoufee and fried crawfish was awful.  The etoufee had a dark brown gravy like taste that overwhelmed the few small pieces of crawfish it included over brown/dirty rice.  It was nasty, I picked out a few of the crawfish, but their flavor was overwhelmed with dark sauce -- I didn't eat.  The fried crawfish was a little better, but instead of being lightly fried, it was very small pieces of crawfish with heavy breading.  Basically, my meal was a waste - so I really didn't bother to eat much of it.  On the flip side, the rest of my family thought the place was pretty good -- not excellent, but good.  I would recommend avoiding the fried platters. My son ordered the chicken, he rated it as nothing special. I should mention that the noise level in the restaurant was extremely loud - so much so, there was a strong desire to exit as soon as possible, even possibly boxing the deserts to go home and eat instead.

Based on this experience, I have no plans to return.

UPDATE:  I guess Pappadeaux reads these reviews as they contacted me shortly after posting.  They asked if I'd be willing to give them another try when in Phoenix if they sent me a gift certificate.  I agreed, but even after providing address information, no certificate was ever received.  (In all fairness, I do know others who have visited other Pappadeaux locations and say it's great.  It just wasn't my experience.)"}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch with customers. Was seated right away, greeted within a minute and had fantastic service. This place was recommended for their seafood. We started off lunch by splitting the sampler of mini shrimp, crawfish fondue, fried alligator and calamari. The alligator was the bomb digitty. I had the fresh sushi and it was fantastic, everything has a southern creole twist on it. Lunch for 3 with appetizer was $75.00 but well worth the money. I will be back again."}
{"text":"went on a Friday night for my gfs birthday. pro tip!! make a reservation we waited more than an hour to get a table around 6pm. we grabbed some drinks at the bar while waiting and Rich the bartender was a great barman. 

after we got our seats we were ready to order. I had the crawfish combo while she had the salmon. entrees are pricey at $25 but after we tasted the food it was worth it. ask for bread if you want to have something to much on. they gave us a free cheesecake since it was my gfs bday. definitely a special occasion type of place and it was overall excellent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix by far!

Pappadeaux makes awesome cajun food. Cajun is one of my favorite styles of food because it is a way of getting food that is spicy and/or seafood and/or covered in butter.

My favorite dish is the mediterranean calamari.  This calamari is fried with artichokes, then topped with feta, capers and tomatoes.  Finally, it is drizzled in butter.  There is clearly a greek influence in this dish, which is another one of my favorite types of cuisine.  

I have frequented this place enough to fall in love with several other appetizers as well: the lump crab and spinach dip, the shrimp and crawfish fondeaux, the jumbo lump crab cakes and the lobster bisque are all delicious!  

For an entree I would recommend the soft shell crab or the lobster tail.  If these are out of your price range, just get a bunch of appetizers and save room for dessert!  The seafood here is the freshest that one can hope for in Arizona, so I personally think it is worth splurging a little.  

Their cocktails are great!  If you get any of the blended ones, be careful!  They are so tasty, you may not notice how strong they are!  I like the frozen margarita and the swamp thing.

Last, but certainly not least, you will undoubtedly be tempted by the deserts here.   This is not only because they have a dessert tray but because they are southern comfort classics.  I am addicted to the banana bread pudding, the key lime pie and all of the different styles of cheesecakes.  They have a few staple items which are always on the tray and they have seasonal selections as well.

I love the atmosphere here.  It has dim, romantic lighting.  It can get loud at times especially when they have live cajun music.  

The service is great here, most of the time.  Once or twice it has been a bit slow, but because of how great the food is, I will always come back for more!"}
{"text":"Good food but service was subpar"}
{"text":"Never disappointed. The food is amazing so much flavor. This is the real deal. Brunch was amazing. I don't believe there has been anything that I've ordered I didn't enjoy. I try a different dish each time but my favorite appetizer or the oyster duo!!!!! I'm so in love with this place. It's so worth the drive"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere. Great service! Our server, Mia, was fantastic! Recommended a dish for my son and she was dead on. The crawfish combo dinner was delicious and spicy. The greek salad is made fresh at your tableside. The praline cheesecake was really good.  I would definitely come back to this restaurant and would recommend this if you've never had Cajun food. :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant had a nice atmosphere. Wait staff was average. Food was good but not memorable. We tried the frog legs, catfish, stuffed crab, and crawfish etouffe. You have to request the bread to get it and it's warm and tasty. Wouldn't drive across the valley again to go but glad we tried it."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant Monday night while my father and I were in town for spring training.  The front desk clerk at our hotel (which was conveniently walking distance) recommended this restaurant to us.  When we arrived the hostess told us it was going to to be an hour wait.  Rather than drive (or go to Fridays) we decided to stick around.  My father sat down and I went to the bar to get a couple drinks.  Albeit the bar was busy but the bartender, Mitch, asked me twice what I would like and then completely ignored me and never got them.  I waited for 20 minutes before Linda came and asked me for my drink order and promptly took care of it.  When two seats became available at the bar she quickly suggested we jump on them.  We ended up having dinner at the bar and everything was wonderful.  At Linda's suggestion we tried the Mediterranean calamari which was outstanding.  For our entrees we had the bacon wrapped shrimp and the scallops.  Both were delicious.  And Linda was simply amazing. She made up Mitch and made our evening wonderful.  We will definitely be back when we are in the city again."}
{"text":"On almost every birthday my family brings me to Pappadeaux this place has the best seafood and while it's a little pricey it is absolutely worth it because they have the best seafood the best Oysters very good service and desserts that are to die for! One particular time I ordered for pick up and they made a mistake on my order so they fix the problem by giving me a gift card and it was awesome"}
{"text":"Stopped by late night for a nice big beer and some alligator. We tried the appetizer trio and the seared ahi tuna. Food was delicious. Service was great for a Friday night. Definitely go for the larger beer on tap. The bigger size is definitely worth the dollar!!"}
{"text":"We love the restaurant and have patronized this location for years. Some changes over time are somewhat troubling, but the overall experience is typically very pleasant. Please bring back the Mediterranean Calimari!!!! Regardless of some small menu changes that we disagree with, we will continue to visit for the fine food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this restaurant when on vacation in Arizona back in 2012.  I've been back to Arizona two more times since, and always made an effort to stop at Pappadeaux with whoever was traveling with me, and every one of them have loved the experience!

The food, drink, and service has been fantastic every time, that I would probably consider it my favorite restaurant.  It's unfortunate that there aren't any closer locations to me, but perhaps that helps keep the quality exceptional and my visits more memorable.  For the record, the alligator bites are a must for an appetizer!"}
{"text":"So back again and this time we weren't disappointed Jemma was awesome and very attentive and made our dining experience very enjoyable. Total difference from night and day.  My wife had the seafood sampler and I had the half chicken  omg it was delicious every single bite and not a single complaint. I'm a very satisfied and full customer. Jemma restored my faith in the company we will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Fresh flowers all through the restaurant.  Good selection from the menu and every bite was fantastic.  Service in most restaurants is a lost art.  While I knew what I wanted to order the waiter explained the menu.  I also liked the fact that he told of the selections he enjoyed to eat himself. Had a very nice lunch and great service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. The seafood is perfection and the steaks are excellent. It has a great ambience and service. I leave longing only for my next visit! Never have I been disappointed."}
{"text":"Ate here with my grandparents-in-law when they came for a visit. We had the best time. We started out sharing a greek salad that included shrimp. It was fabulous. Then we all ordered either lobster or a fish dish of some sort. we tried each other's entrees and all were perfectly cooked and spiced. Their dirty rice is off the charts amazing! I had a salmon dish with a cream sauce that I would definitely order again. We were so full we didn't order dessert but if I went back I would love to try their pecan pie. It looked amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"It is was good.  Brought the wife here as a date night and the service was very good.  I was a little taken aback by the wait even though we had a reservation which is why the star deduction.  For sure better seafood than red lobster"}
{"text":"My family decided to come here for my mom's birthday dinner. One of my brother's was super eager to try it! The high prices were exactly what I expected, so thankfully that wasn't a surprise when I opened the menu. I only mention that because others have mentioned the high prices.  

Anyhow, I was able to try new foods, like: alligator and frog legs! Alligator was breaded and fried, while the server recommended we get the frog legs seared because they come with better flavoring that way. The sauce was delicious, but I wouldn't order them again. I'd definitely have the alligator again. I ordered the Pasta Mardi Gras for dinner. So good! A huge portion, of course.

Our server, brought out a dessert platter and had my mom choose one, on the house!  She chose bread pudding, it was delicious, served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, oh and candle :) Server was very attentive, and personable."}
{"text":"Took my daughter and her fiancee there for his birthday... finally had instance to eat inside (love the patio) it was very comfortable and enjoyable inside.  Server was amazing.  The meal was great.  Oysters are always a top favorite, lobster was cooked wonderfully.  Nothing but praises, nice to have a comfortable and fair, reasonably priced place to go to. Plan on needing a 'to-go' bag."}
{"text":"My wife & I went for dinner with some friends at Pappadeaux's.  The food was good.  We had fried alligator tail for a starter.  My wife had the softshell crabs.  I had the andouille sausage and seafood gumbo.  Both were very good.  The creme brulee we had afterwards was also wonderful.  For Arizona, I would call this good Cajun/Creole....however, nothing beats the French Quarter in New Orleans."}
{"text":"Just had the best birthday dinner in sometime. Chilean sea bass with crab over spinach was awesome. Hurricane with spicy rum mmmmmmm. Isaiah was also awesome with great  descriptions and prompt service."}
{"text":"Is there such a thing as orgasm in a bowl?  YES!  Crawfish ettouffee at Pappadeaux!
I had no idea this was a chain restaurant, or I probably wouldn't have gone.  I'm a mom-and-pop snob :}
Anyway, we had a party of 6 and had about a half hour wait.  We had reservations.  It was a beautiful night, so sitting out on the patio was no big deal.  The hostess even came by once during our wait to let us know they hadn't forgotten about us!
I don't usually get fried calamari (I prefer non-fried seafood) but it was light and crispy and the calamari wasn't rubbery at all.
Service was great, too.  We never had to ask to have our glasses refilled.
it's a great place for a date or a group!"}
{"text":"The oysters baton rough is a perfect appetizing start. Just add a small amount of tobasco sauce for that extra kick."}
{"text":"Love the environment and the food. If you are going specifically for a special, like the oysters ask first..... They always run out."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying our server was absolutely amazing. She was so on point with everything. Kept checking on us almost every five minutes. She's great at recognizing facial cues. Her name was naundee j. If the managers are reading she needs a raise she was fabulous. Now with that being said the kitchen could use some help. For apps we ordered the fondue which would have been good if it had been hot. It was lukewarm when it came out. Not the greatest. The. After that is when it gets scary. We waited AN HOUR!!!!!! For our main course to come out. A freaking hour!! That is ridiculous!!! We kept seeing people who had come in long after we did get their food which is absolutely absurd. It was our servers fault she would constantly go back and check if it was ready and would always apologize. I felt bad for her because I'm sure we got flustered with her. The manager on duty had come by maybe 40 minutes into us waiting and said she would go check what was going on and by that point we were ready to leave. Only reason we stayed was because of our server. She was just to sweet. Kept asking if she could get us some soup or salad while we waited. The food came and oddly enough it wasn't even hot. Again lukewarm. So needless to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"This was the crab fingers sautéed dinner for 23.95 Before we even touched it! It looks like someone's left over meal, not a fresh entree .. the appetizer we ordered at the restaurant was full of sauce and almost no oil.. this thing is like an entree of oil and a side of crab fingers. Gross and tiny portion smaller than the appetizer ! 

We ordered it to go and received it in a closed container already bagged... I wonder why? Who on earth works in their kitchens to approve this to go out ? 

We ate a lobster bisque bowl and the crab fingers appetizer while we were there and both tasted good and were well presented so did not think to open this and check it.. mistake. 

This was our first time there."}
{"text":"First time Pappadeuaxs and it was great! Our server Cristil was fantastic. She had great recommendations! Get the grilled soft shell crab and dirty rice."}
{"text":"Got the crawfish boil...yum!  Good spice mix, but I would have loved to have it spicier.  The oysters were mediocre, not the best quality.  I prefer Ocean Trail for my oysters.  It was super busy, luckily I got there at 5 and didn't have to wait.  I'd really only come here for the crawfish--everything else was average and not special."}
{"text":"Fantastic. New favorite. As busy as they were the staff is dialed. The blackened alligator was to die for."}
{"text":"The best very,, always stop by when we are in Abq.NM. . the happy hour is great,,  especially the po boy..  we love the fresh  oysters.. Wish we had one closer to us in  Az..  this would be my go to place if I lived there,, would give a 6 rating if i could.. being from Louisiana i know good cajun food,, this is the best!!"}
{"text":"Brought the family by for a Sunday afternoon lunch. Great atmosphere, staff is well appointed food and drink is delicious."}
{"text":"I would give it a 5 but it is seriously expensive.  Everything that I had was amazing and flavorful. The service was attentive and professional.  All the food was high quality and done to order.  
The atmosphere is a bit noisy and open so if you are hard of hearing it can be overwhelming.  I would recommend for a special occasion or a treat!"}
{"text":"We've driven by Pappadeaux's on I-17 for years and have always wanted to stop for a meal but rushed by to get home 100 miles North.  Until today, that is.  Seven of  us lunched here and all were very satisfied.  The appetizer was about the the best and lightest deep fried calamari I've had in years, the gumbo was authentic and good, and my fried oysters were wonderfully done.  The seafood pasta dishes, fried shrimp, tilapia and catfish got high praise from the others. The batter on everything was light with no hint of oiliness. I lived in new Orleans for several years.  Cajun style food this good with uncommonly courteous service in the New Orleans manner  would get praise on the Gulf...to find it in desert-bound Phoenix AZ is amazing. The drinks are great too but I give only 4 stars because its become pricey. Figure about $50 each with two drinks per."}
{"text":"3.5 Nice seafood spot with a variety of grilled or fried entrées.

 For apetitizers my hubby ordered a half dozen Gold Coast Oysters. He said something about them being an aphrodisiac HA! I ordered baked lobster mac and cheese. We shared the Pappadeaux platter (1 pc catfish, 1 pc tilapia, extra shrimp, fried crawfish, 2 blue crab cakes, and french fries) and still didn't finish it. The shrimp and crawfish were too spicy for me my hubby loved it. 

My dad ordered the fried catfish, red beans and rice plate while son ate grilled shrimp/grilled tilipia/broccolini and fries. 

The desert presentation was the best. Although we were past stuffed, we tried to make room for the key lime pie and the humongous serving of vanilla cheesecake.

Overall, the experience wasn't horrible. We would def do it again."}
{"text":"I am a native Texan, so dining at Pappadeaux was simply a way of life!! When my family and I moved to the Los Angeles area, we were deeply saddened there were no Pappas restaurants in Southern Cali. The nearest one is Phoenix.....so what do we do??? We plan our trip to Phoenix just to eat at Pappadeaux! Not even kidding!! 

We made reservations for a Saturday night , 7/22/2017, at 7:30pm and the evening started out horribly. Our server didn't smile, didn't share her name, didn't welcome us, nor did she take our drink order for the first 17 minutes of us being seated. The entire time, my family and I are saying, we drove over 300 miles, we are NOT going to allow one server to ruin our evening. My kids were asking, Mom, when is she going to offer us bread or water? She never did. After I flagged her down so she could finally take our order, her demeanor was even more negative. Even after all of this horrible service, we were still holding out for a better outcome.....until she disrespected my husband in front of my family. My husband asked for butter for our daughters entree because this is the way it's served in Houston. Our server immediately says, \"we're not in Houston, but I'll get it for you anyway.\" And that was it!! We were done... my husband got up to get the manager.

Even though our evening started off on a rough note, Keely Cambridge made us feel sooooo much better. She apologized and made us feel so welcomed. She made our evening spectacular. She also changed our server to Cristil, who catered to us! Thank you Keely and Cristil for turning our lemons into lemonade! We will be back soon"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for seafood on a Monday night and thought Pappadeaux would be the perfect place. To my surprise, this place was packed and I know why.

Our waiter Benjamin was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. We were in the mood for some calamari but decided to go with an untraditional version of fried calamari. Benjamin recommended the Mediterranean calamari which comes with a lemon caper sauce, feta cheese and artichokes. It was amazing! The fried calamari was served hot and crispy despite being served in an abundant portion of sauce which was so flavorful!

We ordered a Caesar salad and to my surprise, it had the perfect amount of dressing and cheese! I say this because I find myself always having to order extra sauce or dressing on my entrees because most restaurants skimp. 

We were also served a hot baguette fresh from the oven and our server recommended that we dip the bread in the lemon caper sauce from the calamari and it was addicting! 

We ordered the lobster tail which came with mashed potatoes and broccolini and the shrimp and scallop orecchiette pasta with asparagus and lump crab in a creamy vodka sauce.

The 12 oz lobster tail was cooked to perfection, perfectly seasoned, grilled yet very tender. Each bite tastes like little pockets from heaven especially when you dip it in the melted butter. 12ounces is actually a very generous portion. The broccolini and the mashed potatoes were the perfect sides for this succulent and flavorful lobster tail. We had just come back from Newport Coast and this lobster tail dish ranks as one of the best prepared shellfish entrees that we have ever had. 

My pasta dish had plenty of \"tomatoey, creamy\" vodka sauce. It wasn't bitter or spicy. It was flavorful with the right amount of cream in order to cut out the acidity and bitterness of the tomato sauce. My pasta was cooked al dente and it came with 4 jumbo sized shrimp. One of my pet peeves is when shrimp isn't properly deveined or cleaned. That was Not the case here but let me tell you about my scallops! My scallops were sweet, tender, savory and they melt in your mouth. On top of my pasta dish were portions of lump crab meat that only because of its color, could easily be missed but the naked eye but not by your taste buds. No doubt that the crab meat added to the decadence of this dish which also had a few pieces of perfectly cooked asparagus tossed in. I truly was doubtful about the combination of scallops, crab and shrimp in this entree has to be one of the best seafood pasta dishes in town!!!! 

For dessert, yes we still ordered dessert! How can you pass up dessert when they bring out the fresh dessert tray for you to view?!!!!
We ordered the banana pudding. I know what you're thinking. Of the entire selection: key lime pie, creme brulee, cheesecake, praline cheesecake, and Haagen Daz ice cream (I can't even remember the others), I picked the vanilla wafer banana pudding?!!!!
Yes I did! The chilled banana pudding is served in a mason jar, is densely layered with wafers, whipped cream ( actual heavy cream that is whipped and sweetened with sugar! No cool whip here!), and fresh banana slices. When I say fresh banana slices, I mean that there was not one brownish, mushy banana slice in the jar! This dessert doesn't look like much but the portion is very generous and we could NOT finish it. 
We decided to take the dessert home and they bring you the lid to the mason jar so you can take it home.

Overall the value was excellent! We took our entrees and our dessert home.

Now let's talk about the service!!!
Benjamin our waiter was attentive and never needed cuing from us for him to refill our beverages. We always had plenty of everything! New forks for the salad and main dishes, plenty of napkins, bussed the table immediately. I really appreciate when the staff is able to make recommendations because they are knowledgeable about the menu. He was excellent, polite, attentive yet allowed us our privacy. I have had experiences at restaurants where waiters tell us their entire life story. Uhhh awkward! Pappadeaux knows what they are doing and it shows!

I swear to you that I am not receiving any compensation or benefit from this review. We overheard someone say as they were leaving the restaurant,\"This place makes me feel good!\" 
Enough said!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. All in all the food tasted fresh, delivered hot and delicious.  I had the Creole Shrimp & Grits.  The Creole Shrimp was good but I've had better. It was a little bland, could have used a bit more salt. The andouille grits were fantastic. 

Skyler was our server tonight. She was wonderful. Very attentive to our needs, took very good care of us.

There are some very good looking items on the menu so we will be back to try them!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food for a chain restaurant! Normally we would never go to a chain place for dinner - especially in phoenix - but i could not resist all the pics of their food on facebook.

We started with the spinach/lump crab dip, it was good but not outstanding. I ordered the big bayou platter with stuffed shrimp, bacon wrapped shrimp and lobster - it was excellent (dirty rice was great too). My gf ordered king crab legs - wow - she got the medium and i swear it was a full pound and they tasted great."}
{"text":"We come here at least 2x's a month... We always ask for Audrey, she is the best waitress, fun, has a cool Boston accent and is great at what she does. I would recommend her, so request her. :)

Food is always great, I've had 2 instances where I had to send my food back, one was because my toddler sneezed all over my food after only two bites, so they gladly took it back a replaced my meal and the other time was when I was preggo, I had ordered salmon and it was just a little too, \"not done\"... So the got me a new meal and gave our whole table free desserts. They are excellent at making sure you have a fab dinner and are happy. So be kind if there is an issue, they gladly make thing right with a smile on their face. 

I love many dishes on their menu... Seafood Cobb salad, oysters, gator (1/2 blackened & 1/2 fried) which is a fave of ours, Alexander mahi, salmon Alexander, good ol plank salmon and asparagus, bacon wrapped shrimp is amazing, their pastas are great and we especially love their banana pudding!

Go, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"At first it was excellent, till I took a bite of my catfish fillet. A long string like object came out which they were claiming was a tendon... you know a tendon 8 inches long ... News flash Im a graduate of aquatic pathology thanks for the fried tapeworm. If you eat at this place inspect your food, my fault for not checking i suppose but wow. Managers and the server were wonderful people but when called by their call center they were demanding proof. Nah ill save the proof for when and if i get worms and then they will hear from my lawyer. Cheers."}
{"text":"I am from phoenix, but moved to Orange County/Los Angeles area 6 years ago, but still visit AZ a lot. I remember coming here when i was little but don't remember much about the food. Passed this place on the way home from the airport on December 29th, and as a huge fan of Cajun food, I had to stop in. I had to give 5 stars because the food, the service, and the New Orleans ambiance were all to a tee. We got a couple fancy (expensive) cocktails while we waited at the bar for our table. Drinks weren't anything special, but the bartenders very friendly, and offered bread and butter while we waited. We didn't have to wait long before we sat, and if it were warmer out, I would not have minded having cocktail hour on their awesome patio before dinner. You would never know this place is right next to one of Phoenix's busiest freeways. We sat down and our waiter was Bo L(sorry if i didn't get his name right, my receipt rubbed his name off). Anyways we ordered some wine and tried their oyster and shrimp appetizer. Not impressive. But everything else was. Their Lobster Bisque was rich and tasty and I ordered the Seafood Gumbo that came with my Shrimp Po' Boy. My mom ordered her favorite, the Crawfish Etouffée which was superior. My Po' Boy was good, but it was the fried and seasoned shrimp that really made the sandwich. My seafood Gumbo was very authentic and delicious, but i am a sucker for Lobster Bisque which I thought was better. We also ordered a side of their Mushroom Risotto which was cheap and very flavorful. I cannot wait to come here again next weekend when I am visiting. I did some research for good cajun in LA, and cannot find any in, out of all places, Los Angeles. I will have to go to Phoenix for good cajun."}
{"text":"MIA was the best the Manager I forgot her name was very kind and grateful.. the food was amazing literally all of the staff was kind and funny and sweet thank you MIA you made my experience amazing."}
{"text":"I was taken here on a date, I don't really eat cooked seafood (sushi junkie here), so there wasn't much on the menu for me to order, which isn't their fault and if I had been given a choice I wouldn't have gone there.  However the Caesar Salad and French Fries I ordered were great! The complimentary bread was also very good! The service though is absolutely phenomenal, they are on top of everything, very friendly. I felt very well taken care of by them."}
{"text":"Quality and prestige have fizzled out. Used to go there often,but it has been lack luster as of late. Far better places out there with more flare."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! If you want to experience New Orleans delicious cuisine, this is the place. I will be back and recommend it !"}
{"text":"Always a fan of Pappadeux.  The last time I was here was for a group Valentine's date with two other couples.  Love was in the air that night especially since the couple at the table next to us got engaged.  Not exactly what I would call a romantic intimate setting but hey, it worked for them because the lady said yes!

I love their crawfish, the fried alligator, and the Pappadeux oysters.  I haven't really ventured out to try anything else besides those three items.  The crawfish they serve up here has good flavor and are big but not exactly the best with all the new crawfish boil shops popping up.  I do think their fried alligator is still the best in town especially with their dipping sauce.  As for the Pappadeux oysters, what's not to love?  It's a dressed up oyster!

This place gets packed fast, it's always super loud in here, and the decor is kind of tacky and gimmicky but it's a seafood restaurant so what do you really expect?  Come to Pappadeux for a fun night out with some decent eats!"}
{"text":"Staff was wonderful!  Waiter went the extra mile to get us waters to-go as he found out we were tourists heading out to Sedona for a hike.  During happy hour, bartender was extremely courteous.  When we wanted to move to a booth, she not only helped us bus the table herself personally, but she also continued to bring extra ice teas.  I really miss the service at Pappadeaux.  If only all restaurants give the same experience.  As for the food, order the Happy Hour Fondeaux, cheesy wine butter crawfish and shrimp delight.  Half dozen Oysters for $4.99!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to the I/17 location in Phoenix last night for the first time.  The parking lot was packed, so we were excited that the food must be great.  The hostess said it would take an hour and a half, so we saddled up to the bar instead.  

The bartender's were nice, but way understaffed.  It was taking an average of 5-10 minutes for new people to get recognized.   The bread and butter was the highlight of our meal......warm, crisp and fresh tasting.  My girlfriend's salad was loaded with dressing that was mediocre tasting ( she only had a few bites).  But,my gumbo was pretty good and very fresh tasting. 

 My girlfriend's mussels and lobster dish was overcooked as the seafood was hard and rubbery, while my crispy salmon dish barely resembled the awesome picture on the menu cover.  It tasted bland and only had a single, tiny speck of the delicious crab advertised on the picture.  We ate exactly 1/3 of our meal before calling it a night, and a hundred and fifteen dollars later, we left disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent experience and excellent food. Went for the first time in San Antonio and will definitely be going back. Yiasou"}
{"text":"Received an email from Pappadeaux advertising crawfish special on Wednesday and Thursdays after 3pm. So, me and my family of 8 made the 1 hour and 45 minute drive and we were excited as we haven't had crawfish in a long time.  We were seated at 5 pm and the menus stated the crawfish is available at 5. Ok, no biggie.  I place my order then I'm told \"sorry we don't have any crawfish\". So I ordered the soft shell crab and my son ordered the steak Oscar medium rare.  Our food arrived, mine is ice cold, my son's steak is still mooing and my sister's food was cold.  The server asked us once in a 2 hour time frame if we needed anything.  I will NOT waste my gas to make the trip here again."}
{"text":"I stop just short of 5 stars only because it's a chain.  Not a huge chain, but a chain none the less.  I love the oysters, but the appetizer trio they have is incredible, especially the fondeaux.  Everything tastes fresh and flavorful from start to finish.  Fried alligator anybody???  You betcha'.  And an incredible dessert selection to finish it all off.  Have the banana pudding with Nilla wafers!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here!    Such great service from Haleigh and Christian!   Best crab cakes ever! !!!"}
{"text":"Being from New Orleans, I was really looking forward to having a dinner here. The opportunity came when I was asked where I wanted to go for my birthday so off we went. 

Openers was Fried Oysters, oh how I miss them, but they were merely satisfying. Buried in French Fries, I found about six small ones. We had another appetizer, don't remember what, that we didn't want to finish. It wanted to take home so we flagged a waiter and asked him to put it in a box so it wouldn't sit uncovered on the table for the entire meal. We had our entrees coming anyway. I ordered the Shrimp Étouffée and the other was a pasta dish of sorts. 

After about 15 minutes our entrees arrive in a bag. They had packed the whole order to go! We explained the problem and the bag went back to the kitchen. 

About 10 minutes later the entrees, and apologies, arrived.  The pasta dish my partner ordered looked and tasted wonderful. The Étouffée looked sad. Over warmed, dry, and tasted it. But it was a birthday gift so I kept my mouth shut and enjoyed the company. 

As we were leaving, I took the waitress aside and apologized for the confusion and asked what had been remade and what had been poured onto a plate and sat to warm under a lamp. You guessed it. 

Now, two wait-persons were involved. Hey, our original disappeared. But you would think she might stop by to check with us before packed up the order based on a message from a trainee. (Our mistake)  But, really, what would it have cost them to remake both entrees as it was their mistake. 

Perhaps a one-off issue but the oysters were disappointing and well, the service badly managed."}
{"text":"This place knows seafood, but if you don't want to wait go in the afternoon it is packed in the evening.

We really enjoyed the food I had the sea bass and it melted in my mouth like butter. I also had the oysters, these things were huge. My 2 young daughters tried them and loved it.

My wife got the ribeye which was huge and very tasty.

The atmosphere is nice, waiting isn't that bad they have a nice  patio and live music so it's bearable.

The only downfall is the table seating inside is too close to the table next to you. It's like they want to get as many into every spot they can.

Overall the food and service were great."}
{"text":"We went here today around 2:30 today and what a great time + delish food! We sat at the bar and had great convo and was happily entertained. Not too mention, the manager, Arizania, was an absolute doll. We LOVE this place! It's our first stop when we come to visit the Phoenix / Scottsdale / Tempe area."}
{"text":"It's a chain but a good one. It's been at this location for a long time now, they're still thriving, and it's all for good reason.

There are a lot of great options here but some of my favorites are the catfish po' boy, fried alligator and crawfish boil. One must try appetizer are the sautéed frog legs. If you haven't had frog legs before this is a good place to try them. 

They've got great atmosphere indoors, a great patio that typically features live music and the service is always fantastic. A fine choice for lunch ,dinner, drinks or all of the above."}
{"text":"Here is my take on this place. Staff is always great and helpful. The food tastes great and always fresh. The happy hour is good, but not a party style happy hour. More subdued happy hour. Good prices but a little more quiet. The restaurant is clean and well kept. Problem I have is the portions continue to get smaller and smaller but the prices never change. I understand market value, but cutting portions into half and keeping the steep price seems a little disingenuous.
Really my only issue is the price to portion here. Everything else I love."}
{"text":"Place is bomb.. had the grilled Frog Legs, Lobster sushi Roll, and the seafood cobb salad for lunch.. sooooo good.. 

Been here once before and had the aligator appetizer, which was really good and also the crab stuffed shrimp.. everything was great.

Tiffany, the girl that waited on us, was really nice and very helpful as well.

Will definitely go back again !"}
{"text":"I stumbled onto this place while staying next door at the Hyatt Place and have been coming here for the last few years. I always thought what a Bizarre place to put a Restaurant but I guess when you have a great product then you acquire a following. This place is always busy at night no matter what night of the week. I suggest the Caribbean lobster or Filet Mignon, both very Tasty."}
{"text":"What brings my review down a peg is that our server was not very attentive or efficient.  Barring that, the food was good except the cold fries under my frog legs, which my complaint fell on deaf ears."}
{"text":"The food here is great for a franchise chain, and great service too.  But the prices are way too high.  I mean $8 for soup, not a bowl, but tiny 6 ounce cup.  Drinks are great but at $12 a pop you might want to stick a bottle of rum in your pocket.  The frog legs are good, but again expensive.  Try the happy hour for a better deal."}
{"text":"What can I say? I love this place. When I lived further away, I found myself here only for special occasions. Now that I live 2 miles away, I come here much more often. Lunch, dinner, happy hours... they never disappoint. Food is always delicious. Love the bar area during happy hour. Fun and lively, yet not too raucous... and bartenders are always cool as heck. On wknds, they have live music on the patio, always nice if you like live music, which I do and always appreciate. 
Once recently, I mentioned to our server that one of my sides was really salty. I didn't want any comps or new food and told her so- yet she sent her manager over to our table to reassure us with some kind words. In a world that seems to have forgotten good, old fashioned customer service, Pappadeaux knows what's up."}
{"text":"This place is d'lish for seafood in the desert !  My boyfriend and I have been twice in the past few years because it is pretty far on the west side for us.  But it is well worth it when we are craving some crawfish or crabcakes!  It's easy to pass by if you haven't been because it is along side the highway shortly after you pass Bobby-Q's.

The front entrance is very pretty with the vines, fountain and greenery.  It's nice to see this in the desert...it cools things down drastically !  The bar inside is great and every time I've been it's always been packed but chairs open up pretty quickly.  The bartenders are great and always happy to tweak drinks (I got the mango margarita and added strawberry puree). :)  They had oysters flying outta that bar like ninjas!!  I wished that I liked them because it's part of what everyone loves about this place.  Just can't get past that texture....yeesh. 

When we sat we were in the back room that if this restaurant was on the water we would be hanging right over it....I wish.  Our waiter came back who was VERY stressed out - he stressed US out !  Wiping the sweat from his face, hands shaking, running back and fourth.  It's a good thing they have food runners who help out because I'm not sure we could have handled that all evening.  Now, onto the good stuff....

We ordered a small bowl of Seafood Gumbo to share and try as well as the Fried Calamari.  The Seafood Gumbo was delicious with a little bit of spice to it, lumps of seafood which I'm pretty sure is what gave the yummy broth it's good flavor! Calamari was crispy and good.....not as good as Salt Cellar, but good. :)

For dinner we split the Seafood Platter which they split up for us before it got to our table.  It had.....EVERYTHING.  Crawfish, crabcakes, stuffed shrimp, oysters, etc.  It was a MASSIVE portion so do not order this on your own unless you can gorge yourself into a coma.  I don't recommend it because they have a lot of desserts to chose from.  

On that note, we ordered the creme brulee.  Good....lawd.  It was amazing.  the inside was super creamy and perfect. Top was crispy as expected with a side of strawberries and raspberries.  I was very happy with our choice on desert!"}
{"text":"Celebrated another family birthday here Sunday. Started with oysters, crab cakes.
All good. Wife had grilled Texas redfish and really enjoyed. I had blackened red snapper, and it was delicious.
All the food was very good. Service a bit uneven. Different people bringing different things. Had to ask for bread, but got it and it was perfect. Our main server, though not a pro, was pleasant, and that's worth some points.
Free dessert for the birthday, cheesecake, and it was delectable!"}
{"text":"The drinks were perfect! The wait was long......my food was mediocre. Our server tried to make it right for us but after being there almost 3 hours, I was over it. Maybe it's Arizona. Everything I ate while visiting was blah."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. My husband and I been here several times."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves to come here for their alligator and even though he's over the frog legs and he'll never eat those again (last time he had them they tasted like swamp is what he said) they have a great filet mignon! Chris Ruth's has NOTHING on them when it comes to their filet mignon! I didn't even need steak sauce because it was so good without it!! We use to make it a yearly thing since we are pretty far away but we seem to be going here way more than our pockets can afford! Hahaha"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous and the atmosphere was also nice.  Louisiana Seafood and Sausage gumbo was good, the seafood gumbo was also good, the Seafood platter was great (fried shrimp, fried tilapia, and fried crawfish) and my husband had the shrimp étouffée, dirty rice and   fried catfish and it was also very good."}
{"text":"New update guys..

Wish They Would Increase Beer Selection MO RE Stouts Ipa.etc. better then last time service and food amazing."}
{"text":"Pappadeaux never ceases to disappoint. I have been to quite a few of their locations and they have consistently had great food and service. 
  This time I tried the Atlantic Salmon Alexander prepared medium rare with shrimp, scallops and crawfish in a slightly spicy cream sauce. It was cooked perfectly with a portion that was big enough to feed 2. No matter what location I go to this place is always busy and has at least a 20 minute wait even longer on the weekends. The owners of these joints originally started in the steakhouse business in Texas so that is what I want to try next time. My servers name was Nick L and he went above and beyond to make my dining experience pleasurable."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple time.  Have eaten at other Pappadeaux venues across the US.  Never really had a bad meal here or any other location.  Given that we live in a desert this is about as good as seafood gets.  There are other places that charge a lot more (Eddie Vs for example) but I've found Pappadeaux to be just as good and a whole lot cheaper (although Pappadeaux cost a few bucks)."}
{"text":"We used to live in Illinois and would frequent this restaurant every week. We were so excited that it's now in Phoenix.   We don't go weekly, but we try to get there as often as possible. There are so many things on the menu that we love.  Great atmosphere, consistently great food, and live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great seafood!  The fish is amazing.  The best I've had in Arizona and... a lot of places really.  I'd go back sooner but the location, while right off the highway, isn't ideal as far as a neighborhood goes, so I do not find myself in that location often.  If someone said they wanted great seafood though, this is where I'd send them."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were back at Pappadeaux last Monday. Right off the bat I will say that I have never gone to Pappadeaux and not had at least a 15 minute wait. There have been times that I was quoted a 1.5 hour wait. Waiting sucks but the food is worth it. Personally a 45 minute wait is my cut off but if there is a seat at the bar I will get a few drinks while waiting. 

We were seated and the waitress explained that she was training so we expected to possibly experience a couple hiccups. We ordered a dozen oysters, fried gator and shared a blackened salmon and salad. Our oysters and gator came out immediately with bread and butter. Everything was excellent. Then we waited for our entree and salad....and waited...and waited. After about 15 to 20 minutes our waitress came by and apologized and let us know that our entree was coming. I tried to play it cool and not act agitated but at this point we knew we would miss the movie that we had planned on seeing after eating. I requested that she bring out our salad while we wait for our entree. 

Our waitress arrived 5 minutes later with our entree and salad in hand and once again apologized for the wait. She also explained that our there was an issue with our salmon when the chef split our meal onto two plates and that she would be bringing us out another fillet shortly. BTW, it is nice that it was split for 2 but I would have been equally happy to share from the same plate, however I do see this as an over and above service and appreciate these little efforts. She also offered to bring us a dessert at the end of our meal to make up for the wait and the problem with the salmon. The food was all delicious and as promised the waitress brought out the dessert tray and asked what we would like to try. We went for the creme brulee which did not disappoint. Our check did not include the dessert and we were given half off our oysters. This is why I adore Pappadeaux. If there is a problem they go way beyond to fix it and make it up to you."}
{"text":"Our new obsession!
Went there for the first time after my daughter gave me a gift card for Christmas.  Now, we are HOOKED!
We always sit at the bar, but I shouldn't tell you that because it can be tough to get a seat there already.
Not a cheap place, but the food is awesome, service is just as awesome, drinks are awesome.
Do yourself a favor and try the blackened alligator. Then try the lobster bisque, then try anything else on the menu.
They also have happy hour deals that are fairly priced and the desserts are amazing!"}
{"text":"Great seafood and an enjoyable atmoshpere! It's always packed and they are still timely with seating, order taking and refills. Crab cakes are a must!"}
{"text":"Had the worst dining experience ever last night. One member of our party of four was served five minutes before everyone else. Salads and soup brought to our table the same time as our main meal. Drinks never refilled. I finally got up and found a pitcher and water and poured it myself. My wife ordered a baked potato, received French fries. When pointed out to waiter he said, I'll go put that order in now. Never did get it."}
{"text":"I treated my mother to a much needed getaway.  We had lunch and split a gigantic Seafood Cobb Salad.  The salad, coupled with the fresh bagette was the excellent food I've come to expect for many, many years from Pappadeaux's.  Yesterday, our dining was a 5 star experience due to the server.  He was courteous, professional, and patient with my elderly mother. THAT is what put our lunch date over the top!  So, I will return as always. I'm most likely to return mid day for lunch and ask for Benjamin S., our server!  My guests and I will request a table by the courtyard.  We'll enjoy the view from the window, eat fantastic food, & imagine we're in New Orleans.  When Benjamin is serving we will have a helping of southern hospitality at it's finest, because this waiter exhibits those fine qualities to a T!  Thank you, Pappadeaux's!"}
{"text":"This place really stands apart from most restaurants around the valley. It has a large seafood selection and everything I've had is fresh and delicious. There are a couple other restaurants popping up that are giving them a run for their money, but as for now if you want some pretty good quality seafood in Phoenix then you should definitely try this place out. Be prepared for it to always be crowded, but they do accept reservations even for small parties which is very nice. The service could definitely improve, but it's really hit or miss. We had a birthday last night at our table and the hostess said she would tell our server. Not sure who forgot but it got missed. We also sat at a small table with dirty dishes and drink cups the entire meal and even when we finished. It was a bit of a drag, but the food was good! We spent about $200 with 3 adults and 1 child. We had 2 appetizers and 4 alcoholic drinks so it can be a bit pricey. I expected way better service for the amount we spent on our meal. Minus 2 stars for the service"}
