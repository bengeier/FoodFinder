{"text":"i can't believe that CRUPI's doesn't have a review.  I'm insulted!!!  And no i'm not related to the CRUPI family.  I haven't had a better slice or whole pizza anywhere in N. America.  Yes that's some pretty big praise, and of coarse tasting is in the tongue of the beholder...but my tastebuds no a good thing!  Even though it's not in downtown Toronto this mom & pop place offers the best panzerotti (calzone) and bets pizza at reasonable prices.  To me a pizza comes down to the sauce, and the sauce is theeee best!  Even though i moved to Aurora, i still crave a panzorotti with extra sauce on the side...absolutely packed with cheese, pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms and whatver you'd like.  if you're ever in Markham, don't waste your time at the big franchises...try Crupi's Pizza off of McCowan near 16th.....that's all i'm gonna say."}
{"text":"kind of weird how there are 3 reviews that say not recommended even though 2 are good reviews ."}
{"text":"If you like cardboard with a dust of tomato sauce and cheese. Than you will love this place. Use to be a frequent buyer here but since the owners changed a couple of years ago it's gone down hill. The pizza is horrible, and food safe handling is out the window.  My last visit I walked out after watching them handle money and then food. Without washing hands."}
{"text":"closed for good!  i had been always going to crupu's pizza since my days in high school and now it's gone forever!"}
