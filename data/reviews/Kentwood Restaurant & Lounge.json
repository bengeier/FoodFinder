{"text":"My husband and I were given a gift card for kentwood. We have never heard of it before that and I was worried because the reviews were not great. However, we enjoyed our time there. We had broasted chicken, fish fry, mash potatoes,  and french fries. The broasted chicken was the best we have ever had. My husband said the fish was good too. The fries were good, nothin special. They did offer a full bar and the prices were pretty good.      Here is the reason its missing some stars. The mashed potatoes were instant. The waitress was also not very friendly.  The lounge needs some renovations. When we came in there was no sign to wait or take a seat and noone there to assist us so we just wondered into the lounge part of the establishment.        So would I go back? For the broasted chicken,  oh yea! For our anniversary again probably not. Its not very romantic. Although the waitress wished us happy anniversary lol."}
{"text":"Couple paying their bill before us sealed the deal... they were confused about their bill. They thought they were charged for 3 drinks even though there were only 2 people in their party.  Cashier response? \"I am not a server I don't know about those things\"  Ugh  They argued back and forth for over a minute about whether the soda was free refills... I finally walked over and grabbed a menu... showed the cashier where it said free refills... THEN he was willing to get the server.  We would have been there all night waiting to check out.  Side salad had lots of iceberg lettuce with brown edges... a few slivers of carrot and a bit of diced beets.  Spaghetti with meat sauce was obviously canned... meat was tasteless but the portion size was ok for my husband.  My ham was inedible... so dry it really couldn't be cut... it sort of shredded.  Sweet potatoes were also from a can, not even any syrup that I could have used to try and help the ham... and while the ham was room temp the sweet potatoes were steaming hot?  All around us people were complaining about their food to the server and not getting much relief so we didn't even bother."}
