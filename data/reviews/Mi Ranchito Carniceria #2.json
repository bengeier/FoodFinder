{"text":"The food is Terrific but I wished they had a \"Milder\" red salsa...  If you like your salsa Very Hot! they have plenty of it!  Great Market style restaurant..."}
{"text":"I love this place and their specials on the carne asada are amazing! The staff is always friendly and courteous and sell some of the best corn tortillas I've tried. I am definitely a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I go there every once and a while to buy some beef. I went there today with my kids after we painted a couple of rooms in my house. We all looked a little worn out wearing worn out, painted clothes. Some dark skinny Mexican kid in the back started ridiculing us for some reason. The dude barely speaks english. His compadres went along with it. Ya...imagine how uncomfortable that was. Their meat isn't that good anyway, you'll find better deals in Tolleson."}
