{"text":"First time there, my girlfriend and I sat at the bar. no welcome or is this your first time here? Ordered drinks and looked at the menu, no recommendations from him. You would think that as a new place only 2months old they would be more in your face of the house specials. He was too busy looking at he's phone then talking to us. Ordered the Carpaccio, bland and I felt like it was made earlier in the day, Stuck to the plate and had no flavor. Bartender was lame, tall guy, mid 30's to 40's couldn't care. Watch servers walk up to the wait station eating food asking for bev. to wash it down. Just bad!! I was told by all the few people that I asked about this place, all was bad ! I wanted to see for my self since the have a very good reputation. This place is not good,no atmosphere and really bad service!! Why wouldn't you tell your staff to ask if this is your first time here and to recommend something??? We didn't even get bread service? First and last time here!!"}
{"text":"Great food. I had the linguini with clams. Really good. Husband got the veal chop. Also very good. Service was great, thanks Gino! Wine prices seemed high, but food very reasonable. A little noisy when restaurant is full, but a warm and welcoming space. We loved it and will be back. For sure."}
{"text":"Love this new Italian restaurant right off of Scottsdale road north of pinnacle Peak. It's a bit loud, but the Decour is very nice of service is excellent, and the food tasted great!"}
{"text":"We are thrilled to have the new Tomaso's closer to our home in Carefree! We would travel all the way down to Camelback Road in Phoenix to experience their delicious menu and now it's just 15 minutes away!  Our server Evan was very knowledgeable in helping us pair a wine with our meal and was an extremely conscientious server over all. As for the food, we have never been disappointed and always look forward to their specials as well as their regular menu. If your looking for true Italian food, excellent service and at reasonable price then Tomaso's is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very nice bottle of wine and the meal was very good. We were not disappointed. Service was very good! Ask for Rafael's section."}
{"text":"A fantastic, authentic Italian experience! John Bartlett (Manager) truly cares about you and your dining experience. Servers Giovanni and Raffael are amazing! I brought a group of 33 folks for a business dinner event and could not have been happier. Truly exceeded ALL expectations!! This is a \"must do\" for personal and business dinners!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for my wife's mothers birthday.  Food was very good.  Veal marsala for me and veal scaloppine for my wife. Her mother ordered the Halibut special with shrimp stuffed ravioli.  The fish was a bit over cooked and we mentioned it to our waiter Gino. He quickly told us he would have the kitchen fire up a new one.  The second one came out fairly quickly and was cooked perfectly.  Gino was very attentive and made sure everything was perfect.  He even allowed us to have the kitchen make us an off the menu risotto with cheese and mushroom for my mother who was sick and asked us if we could bring some home for her.  Would definitely ask for him on our next visit.  Great dinner and will return."}
{"text":"Giovanni is outstanding! We had a wonderful evening, great food and service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"What a delight!  First time in & won't be the last.  Great atmosphere starting with Giorgia & Ana  who greeted us so warmly.  We started with Calamari which was beautifully seasoned with a light breading & fresh, tasty sauce.  Then we shared an Arugala & Pear salad with Gorgonzola crumbles. With that came warm, crusty REAL Italian bread with a choice of olive oil or a creamy pesto butter.  I had Fettucine Ala Carbonara....Outstanding!  The hubby had Veal Scallopine Francese that came with a crispy potato cake & sauteed veggies.  All were artfully presented, perfectly seasoned & just flat out tasty!  Save room for dessert!  We tried both Cannoli & Tiramisu.  You can't go wrong either way.  Delicious!  So much on this menu we want to try.  On top of everything, was the manager, Phillip, who stopped at every table and made you feel like long time friends that he was thrilled to see again.  We eat out a lot & rarely has everything come together as well as our first visit to Tomaso's When In Rome.  Motto bene!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Tomasos and I have to say I was very impressed. From making my reservation to arriving and being seated everyone was friendly and in a upbeat manner . The happy hour is decently priced and as always the food taste amazing.  We were served within a reasonable amount of time with the best customer service from our waiter Robert. He was very friendly and always had a smile on his face, he took care of our needs right away and made sure we had everything we needed. The atmosphere was very pleasant and we had an nice enjoyable dinner without any issues . If your looking for some tasteful Italian food and great customer service I would definitely recommend Tomasos for you next dining experience . 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Service was poor at first but got better. Food was avg at best. I'd give a 4 out of 10. Had a pasta dish with shrimp and crab. Couldn't taste the crab so didn't know what it really was and there was only 2 shrimp and over cooked. Nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Their happy hour goes until 10pm! A friend recommended this place so I met her after work. We sat at the bar where the service was very attentive and the staff was friendly. My friend and I shared everything which gave us the opportunity to try different things. I always order calamari and carpaccio if it's on the menu so I can compare to other restaurants. Tomaso's calamari was really good and not too heavy (even though it's fried). The carpaccio was good as well but wasn't a fan of all the hazelnuts. Mastros still has the best carpaccio. Next we enjoyed the veal meatballs that just melted in our mouth. Last...was the carbonara. Another menu item I order to compare to other restaurants. This wasn't on the menu but the kitchen was nice enough to make it for us. It was different than some others I've tried (still doesn't beat Rosemarys in NYC) but was very tasty. I liked their spin on the pasta which was similar to gnocchi instead of the traditional spaghetti."}
{"text":"For us, close to being 5-Star BUT something has to be done with the noise level.  Food and Service was great but screaming children make for unhappy guests and it just wasn't our table.  We've been in several times now and the noise prevents us from really enjoying ourselves!  Gino was a great Server and took great care of us; the Manager came over to introduce himself but, oh....the noise!"}
{"text":"Staff nice.  Server was very good.  The noise level was almost overbearing. Management is aware of problem and has tried to rectify with addition of ceiling tiles.  The food was just okay.  I enjoyed the lasagna, but other 3 guests said pasta was overcooked and know real wow or flavor.  When we got out of restaurant it was relief as we all felt a little stressed by trying to talk over the noise. At a table for 4 you could not hear across the table. Even though it is close, not somewhere I wold go again. Fine dining prices for less than average dining.  Kinda like a sports bar without tvs"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried this new Tomaso's location tonight and had absolutely fabulous meals.  To begin, we sat at the bar which is our preferred location, and Tammy was fantastic.  She welcomed us both, asked if we had been before, introduced herself, and gave us tips on the menu.  First class all the way.  For dinner I had the pappardelle Osso Bucco, and it was phenomenal.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was rich and delicious.  My friend had the linguine with clams, her favorite, and was equally thrilled with her meal.  We never order dessert, but we were intrigued by the Angel Kisses, which turned out to be two huge strawberries filled with marscapone and topped with crispy chocolate bits.  A perfect ending to a perfect meal.  We also loved the wine list and the all-day happy hour specials.  We will be back and recommend it to all lovers of good food and wine.

Update:  Still my favorite, but I'm sad that the deconstructed osso bucco is no longer on the menu   I also want to add the spaghetti carbonara and the Cacio & Pepe as superb entrees. And a shout-out to Tammy who makes every visit special and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Despite our large group of friends, the service was excellent. Nicely decorated upbeat restaurant with varying age dinners. Noise level was obstructive for intimate conversation.
Comments as to the food will vary. The crusty bread and seasoned fresh butter outstanding. 
As for the entrees, varying response. Although I did not order the halibut, it received rave reviews from the group. Not so positive comments for the rigatoni amatriciana.  The sauce tasted like a basic pomodoro sauce, lacking the expected flavor of pancetta. 
The osso buco pappardelle was meaty and absolutely delicious. 
The special appetizers for the day, not so special. The zucchini blossoms plating lacked  appealing presentation and perhaps would benefit from a refreshing sauce.  The stuffed figs tasteless, lacking the creamy texture for the filling and sweet appeal one would expect with ripe fruit. 
My chocolate mousse dessert lacking the intensity you expect with a high cacao product. 
Overall a nice experience but not great as I was hoping for this new local establishment."}
{"text":"So excited finally an Italian restaurant that's amazing and nearby my home. Service was incredible and especially for o be surprised that our waiter was a familiar face from a prior restaurant we use to frequent. The food was superb and the ambiance was perfect. Thank you for such an amazing evening."}
{"text":"So good. Best risotto. We have eaten here several times. Great service and even better food. Real deal Italian food. - valet parking makes life easier and they have it. Love coming to this place!"}
{"text":"So excited to dine with family in town for the holidays. We hadn't been back since they opened  but were expecting the same top notch experience in food and service. Where before the service was attentive and personal,  tonight was rushed and distracted.  Appetizers were great, entrees fair.  Very different than our first visit. Hope it's not a bad trend."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and have always had excellent service and food. Phil is always there making his rounds to the tables and making sure that every table is having a good experience. If people have a complaint they should talk to him first before blasting a new restaurant online. I know some people can make a living off from complaining just so they can get a free meal and it's not right."}
{"text":"Was expecting an exceptional dining experience.  However, the food was less than mediocre (veal tough??), vegetables soggy, pasta not cooked well.  Menu limited.
The only saving grace was our waiter Evan.  Exceptional young man."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff!! We needed this real Italian restaurant in North Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Made a specific trip to this place because they advertise a Saturday and Sunday happy hour till 10 pm. When we arrived at 6:00 we were informed happy hour was only till 6:30.  These guys need to get their act together"}
{"text":"We just tried the newly opened Tomaso's When in Rome and loved it!  We started with the meatball appetizer which was moist and flavorful.  One of the best we've ever had.  I had the special which was Zinfandel braised shortribs and my husband had the bone-in Osso Buco.  Both meat dishes were so tender that you could cut them with a fork.  They were delicious.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing , tomasos is the best , we had the osso bucco & ciopino both were excellent Gino our server was great"}
{"text":"Best Lasagna I have ever tasted, it melted in my mouth.  It was a special but I hope they put on the menu, it was heavenly!!  An observation:  bar area was cluttered with boxes, maybe they should be stored somewhere else.  Staff was excellent."}
{"text":"If the food and service was any better, it would have been perfect.  By scoping out Tomaso's menu on Yelp you wouldn't get they're vegan friendly.  They made modifications for me so easily because the chef is so good.  This was the best dining experience I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"If you like dining in an submersion of Rome, then this is the place for you. We were treated like family even though we had no reservation, the hostess was gracious enough to offer us a seat at the bar.
This is the sort of place you go when you just want to get a great meal and relax. Service is exceptional and you will find all manner of clientele from business folk, to families with young children, and octogenarians celebrating a birthday. Its a little loud, but not overbearingly so if one considers the number of tables,
To avoid a wait for dinner we opted to eat at the bar where seats were already available and our service was terrific. Tammy was our bartender she was very friendly and welcoming,  the drinks were fairly priced given the neighborhood  and \"good\", meaning not watered down or made with rot-gut house brands. Tammy made us  a cherry cosomo that was as delicious as advertised. The food was just as delicious as the drinks, best scallops I've had in Arizona.

Its not an easy place to access at the moment since the signage isn't too big and our GPS struggled to find it, but make the extra effort to get there and you will not be disappointed. 

Seriously this is the best dining out meal and exceptional service we have had in years."}
{"text":"In a word...Delicious!  We have been there 4 times and I have been pleased every time.  The service is outstanding and the food is incredible.  The lagsana is amazing and the meatballs are perfect.  My 11 year old devoured a stuffed veal shank, so I didn't get a change to sample that. It's little pricy for a mid-week dinner with the kids but its worth it, as we always have a great time."}
{"text":"Pure CRAP! Probably the worst, No wait, scrap that. Definitely the worst Italian food I have ever had in Arizona or pretty much anywhere else. 

A microwaved TV diner has more flavor and is prepared better than the CRAP they served on our plates when they brought our meals to the table. 

Over cooked and broken pasta, like it was scraped off the bottom of the pot. watery sauce because more than likely they did a poor job on draining the pasta. Raw seafood with no flavor and the absolute worst amatriciana sauce I have ever had. 

Not to mention the food came out five minutes after we ordered it. 

We got as far as cutting the seafood open to see that it was raw and taking a single mouthful of the over cooked pasta and flavorless CRAP they call Italian food and we got up left a tip and walked out. 

This was supposed to be a nice 50th B-day dinner for my Wife. 

Well its certianlly now be one to remember but definatly not cherished.

My advise is to save your money and the trauma to your palate and stay far far away.

Update and Reply to Owners Comment

This my reply to the owners condescending comment about expecting something other than authentic Italian cuisine. 

Sir, We went to your establishment expecting exactly that,\"authentic Italian cuisine\" what was placed on our table was anything but prepared properly or \"authentic Italian cuisine\". 

I myself am very much Italian. I grew up in an an Italian American family on the east coast. Both my Nonno and Nonna (Grandfather and Grandmother) emigrated here from Italy in the 1900's, and I was raised on nothing but \"authentic Italian cuisine\" growing up made by my Nonna and  mia Madre. So I can safely say I know a little something about how \"authentic Italian cuisine\" should taste and how it should be prepared. 

I know good Italian food when I eat it. 

The food that was placed on our table was neither prepared properly, or edible \"authentic Italian cuisine\". 

If it was we most certainly would have stayed, enjoyed our meal, and celebrated my wife's birthday the way we had intended when we chose your establishment to do so. 

What we got instead was tutti cibo male. 

Have a nice day!"}
{"text":"Loved this wonderful place.  The food was truly Italian from Italy, the bolgonese was really good rich and had that wonderful slow cooked flavor. The stuffed spinach gnocchi appetizer was I think the best gnocchi I've ever had, don't miss it!!!  The ciopinno was good but different then I've had in the past, it had a whole lobster tail in it but not brothy at all.  The wine was good and great service from our waitress Tanya.  The owner stopped by and chatted with us about the homemade pasta from scratch, delicious!!! Will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"I gave this 4 stars for several reasons.
#1 The Bread and the compound butter was awesome.
#2 Meatballs were outstanding
#3 The Lobster Bisque was good but not great
#4 The veal chops, one was good, one was tough
#5 They comped the one chop.
#6 The Tiramisu was good, coffee excellent

All and all beautiful place, our waiter was outstanding, courteous, attentive, professional.  I would use him anytime."}
{"text":"3rd visit here and they never disappoint one bit

Some of my favs are

Meatballs off the bar menu- who doesn't love a homemade meatball- very moist and of course some great tasting Marinara sauce to go along with it.

Spaghetti Bolognese- WoW!!! Great balance of the two different types of meats and of course the sauce compliments the meat perfectly.

And all their pasta is homemade.  Very hard to find in the valley and I'm wondering why no one says anything to the \"other\" places that are charging $5 to $10 more than Tomasso's but can't even make their own pasta (??)

Lastly the drinks are great and wine list has some good selections with good value 

If your tired of boring Italian, try this place for sure!"}
{"text":"First time here, and it was great!  The service, presentation, and entree's were all 5 stars.  This location had only been open for about a week, but you could never tell.  Gino our server was attentive, but not overly so.  The manager also came over to introduce herself.  It's a beautiful space, with adequate separation between tables and good acoustics.  Even though the restaurant was busy, the noise level was never an impediment to our conversation.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"To start with. If you claim to be the \" Best Italian restaurant in Phoenix \" and you don't have fresh made pasta you are already out of the running.
This is mediocre restaurant with low quality Italian. The service is good but it is very open and noisy
Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I wish there were half stars. I don't think this is truly a three but it is not a two star. 

Anticipation and foodie joy was going through my mind as I watched this restaurant being built.  I had high expectations as it is an up market restaurant with the matching prices 

Disappointment was my reality with the meal and physical venue. 

I ordered the crudo fillet mignon carpaccio.  This was rather enjoyable.   The arugula was a little overwhelming as there was a lot of it. The hazelnuts added that little bit of magic to the dish. 

The braised short ribs off the specials was delicious    The meat fell off the bone and was tasty

The chicken sorrentina was disappointing. While the sauce was not to sweet or bitter the whole dish did not have the elegance or excitement that this price level establishment should have had. It was rather boring in fact

The level of noise was so loud that the server could not hear our order and we had to use a combination of yelling and pointing to the menu.  

We left all rather hoarse and tired from yelling at each other over the meal

I thought it was rather overpriced for what we experienced"}
{"text":"We had John as our server. We know him from Pane Vino.  He is as professional, cordial, courteous and just plain nice as they come. We judged our experience by John so can't speak for other service.  We were a high top of four in the bar area at Happy Hour on Friday, June 9th.  The limited food we ordered was delicious and nice size portions. The drinks (we ordered our usuals, so not on the HH menu) were very good. Nice vibe and many friendly patrons. Since we don't care for big Italian food (I can bare,y finish an appetizer), we do t anticipate dining for dinner. But will certainly return - at least so long as we get John."}
{"text":"I am so happy about this Tomaso's, it is so close to my home.  I have been here several times.  Most with my husband, but I have also brought my girlfriend and my mother in law.  We love sitting at the bar, so we get to cat a bit with Tammy who is fabulous and she makes the best Negroni, just like my daddy used to drink, ah memories.  The happy hour menu is super generous, they offer it until 10p.m.  A few of my favorite dishes are the carpaccio, the gnocchi, the eggplant roulade and the calamari.  We also enjoyed the bruschetta and the caesar salad with chicken as well as the meatballs.  I'm getting hungry just writing about it."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Great food, outstanding service. Giovanni is on point with recommendations. Philip the manager is truly interested in your experience. I would come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The NOISE level was just awful. Management said they are addressing it. I can't tell you how the food was, since I had a headache before they served the meal. If you are looking for a romantic, quiet place....this is not it!"}
{"text":"Was incredibly disappointed, from the minute walking in with reservations for our group of 6.  No smiles, no greetings..  after awkwardly waiting while in a very tight entry that's essentially in the bar.  Three other groups also crammed in this weird space, very poor planning.  No eye contact from any workers.. 
eventually a hostess of leads us to a corner table, still no welcomes.
The waiter comes, he's pleasant and helpful.
But then when the food arrives, what a letdown... after so many good reviews.  Much to salty on all entrees , totally lackluster no flavor Caesar salad.. lobster bisque was watery and not a chunk of lobster to be found..  the nightly special of stuffed figs looked lovely but also had no flavor..
Very loud and poor design. Our group thought it was like cafeteria food.
Save your money... or go get good Italian food at GianFrancos"}
{"text":"Tomaso's When in Rome is AMAZING! I love the Original one too, but the Rome decor and ambience is fun. The food is phenomenal too, just like the other Tomaso's but with a new menu. I love the mozzarella tasting board! Well Done Tomaso! My husband and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went to Tamaso's for dinner with a group of about 10... so wasn't expecting exceptional service. To their credit, the wait staff was extremely  attentive and gracious. The kitchen was a bit slow... but that is to be expected with a large party. 
I sampled a number of appetizers, had the Lemon Veal Scaloppine dinner  and Tiramisu for dessert, in addition to sharing the Spumone Bomba gelato. 
I had been hoping to find a new Italian restaurant in the Pinnacle Peak area that my girlfriend might enjoy... but this might not be it.  Everything was very nice... I just was a bit underwhelmed by the food. I wasn't expecting the Little Italy of old in NYC or Boston's North End... just something above par from local chains.  I was unfortunately underwhelmed."}
{"text":"The parking is inadequate. Seated a the smallest two top ever.   Bread is excellent.  Veal scallopini  is excellent. Pasta dish was okay. Service  was fair."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  The service is always the best super friendly and really professional. Tammy and Jen The bartenders are always fun to be around. There Italian food is always made fresh and it's all super good."}
{"text":"This is \"hands down:
\"MY FAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANT !!!\"  Excellent service!  Excellent food!  Went during Happy Hour and ate both Happy Hour Specials, Daily Special and off the regular menu!!

Gnocchi stuffed with spinach appetizer was so light!  Short rib Special was sooo tender!!!  Came with mushroom risotto!! Melted in your mouth!   The filet stuffed ravioli just perfect!  

They know what they are doing. The chef is right off the boat from Sicily!! Believe me---I know good Italian food!!!!---I too am Sicilian!!!  Momma did not make it better!!!!"}
{"text":"My model wife and I came here since it is so close to our place and is known to be quite good. It did not disappoint.


Octopus salad: excellent. Not dry. tender, succulent.

Caesar salad: very good. Loved the flavor and well balanced. very fresh.

Veal scalping masala: wonderful Beautifully presented and the veal was so tender.

Fettuccine carbonara: Wonderful. very favorable and well presented.

Bread: Really great. Freshly baked and warm. Butter was ample and real.

Service 5/5. Food 5/5."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here a couple of weeks ago with friends and our experience was just great!
Our food was delicious, the drinks were perfect and the ambiance was beautiful.
The staff and managers went out of their way to speak to us and the other diners and that made for a wonderful dinner out. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. We went in for lunch. No drinks and two mediocre salads for $30. My salad had some greens that were wilty and was missing one of the ingredients that it was supposed to come with. I don't mind spending $15 on a good salad (like the omfg salad at The Gladly, or any salad worthy of the price due to fresh, good quality ingredients...). But this was not that, unfortunately. 
Service was friendly, but slow. There weren't very many people in there- so no reason for slow service. Like I said, not impressed. Will continue to go to Spiga instead. It's too bad because I wanted to like this place, especially because it's close to my house and on my way home. Oh well. There are a lot of other great options around."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant. Our main entrees we're delicious. My husband has the bone off osso bucco which he loved and I had a seafood and pasta dish. The calamari however was tough and chewy. We won't be having that again. The other negative was our waitress. It took her over 15 minutes to greet us and offer us some drinks. Every other table was offered bread but it seemed she forgot this too. We'll give the restaurant another try but we weren't too impressed with our first visit...a little underwhelmed."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and deserves 5 stars.  The restaurant is so noisy it is impossible to talk across the table...must shout to be heard.  Left with my ears ringing!  How sad to go out with friends and unable to visit.  What happened to a nice quiet dinner?"}
{"text":"An excellent addition to North Scottsdale restaurants scene. Always enjoyed their Happy Hour drinks and food. Friendly service staff is another plus."}
{"text":"Their in restaurant menu is not the entire menu they have at Tomaso's or the one posted on the Open Table website so that was disappointing. 

Our server, Michael, was great. We enjoyed a very nice bottle of Oregon Pinot Noir. The ambience is nice, but a lot of hard surfaces mean it's very loud and echoey for a white tablecloth kind of place. The laminate flooring and faux Carrara marble in the bathroom suggest some skimping on finishes that show. 

The cioppino pasta was fair. Most of the seafood was cooked nicely except the lobster which was tough and very overcooked. The sauce was watery. Being from San Francisco, I still feel like Cioppino should be a stew and the tomato broth should be packed with flavor. The chicken parmigiana was a better dish but still overpriced for quality.  The tab for value means we probably won't be back but I can see how it might appeal to a certain audience."}
{"text":"I really don't like posting good reviews when I find a great restaurant because then getting a good seat at the bar will be harder :-)  I am making an exception here because it is just too wonderful to keep to myself!  Staff - A+; Food - A+ and Atmosphere - A+.  This is a real gem!"}
{"text":"Visited to check out restaurant and was disappointed. Prices did not reflect service.  We sat down to just try the appetizers and our waiter seemed to forget about us after we ordered.  Never got our drinks refilled once during our entire meal. Completely absent during our meal. Prices were high and portions small but that usually reflects great service not in this case. Will not return."}
{"text":"This place will make you say, Vale!  Packed for dinner, this place still manages to make you feel extra special!  Gino, our server, was very energetic and attentive...and knew his Italian!  We ordered the salmon, halibut, rigatoni, and steak ravioli.  All was delicious and HOT!  The star of the night was definitely the Cacio e Pepe, which we shared with our salads and soup.  You MUST order this dish when I'm Rome :). The only drawback was the volume...definitely a little loud, but that's what you get when a restaurant is so popular. We didn't sit at the bar,  but it was full and lively.  The crowd is much smaller at lunch, so check it out midday for a quieter experience."}
{"text":"The combination of Brittany behind the bar and Giuseppe taking care of us (4) at dinner was truly outstanding - and then came the food.  I had heard the meatballs were the best and they are !!! The pear salad (I forget the full name of it ) is one of the best salads you'll find anywhere. SWMBO (she who must be obeyed) had the Gnocchi and pronounced it right up there with Scoma's in S.F.  All in all a delightful dining experience.  If I was going to pick a nit... yes, it's a little noisy. I mentioned this to the manager as we were leaving and he said there are a couple of things they are going to change about the decor... maybe ceiling tiles and window coverings. But go there for Brittany, Susan ,Giuseppe and by all means the food !!!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Saturday around 7:30pm.  Service asked that I remove my hat. Which I respectfully did so, we felt as if we were treated as 3rd class citizens. If you have a dress code advise so when a group walks in to the hostess area. Ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Pasta was cooked well, but was disappointed with the meatballs. Sauce was very bland. Overall we were in and out in less than 30 min. My VP highly recommend this place since we were new to the area. Very disappointed and a little irritated with service. Needless to say even thought the location is minutes from our house we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, service and ambiance! Newly opened location is doing very well so far. We have had 3 dinners in 2 weeks! The lasagna, steak and chicken parm were amazing. 

Waiter Gino was the best. Everyone was exceptional. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a great new addition to N Scottsdale! We will definitely be returning. Thank you Giuseppe for making such wonderful recommendations and being so inviting!"}
{"text":"Sorry not a fan. Bar tender could not be bothered. Drinks were not that good ( lots of non alcohol additions).. food was good but not exceptional. Maybe our attitude was set from our bar experience. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, wine was delicious and Giuseppe made the experience perfect! We went for dinner but the happy hour looks awesome. All day every day."}
{"text":"My family loves this classic fine Italian restaurant. The staff is always friendly and often entertaining! Always a treat."}
{"text":"Went for Father's Day and it did not disappoint. Great service and the menu was on point. Had  an excellent eggplant park abs gnocchi. Wine selection was great and the portions were generous.  Great for a special occasion or date night"}
{"text":"Tomasos when in Rome did not disappoint. From the decor to the food & service I give it 5 stars. For starters they were open on Christmas but more importantly they didn't force a $100/person prixe fixe menu on you. The holiday menu had a plentiful selection. The prices were in line with Scottsdale high-end Italian restaurants. To start I had a lemon drop martini, one of the best I've had. My daughter & I split a Caesar salad & not like most other establishments, it wasn't drowning in dressing-that was refreshing. My entree was eggplant parmigiana w purse pasta-absolutely delicious. My daughter had the chicken fettuccine Alfredo-also amazing. To end this perfect holiday meal we had mascarpone stuffed strawberries. Hello? Amazing! The service was very good, we had Michael from Chicago & the rest of the staff was also very friendly. I will definitely go back again. I need to try the tiramisu! Bellisimo!"}
{"text":"Third visit...and the last.

Since my last review, absolutely nothing has changed for the better.  The food is still trying to live on the Tomaso legacy but not performing upon anything that allegedly made the Tomaso name.

The waiters, yes pleural, still have a tobacco cloud around them like Pigpen from the Peanuts cartoons.

I am a huge supporter of good food done right.  I typically root for restaurants to succeed.  This is the very first establishment I actually am rooting the other way.

I said it before and will say it again, if anyone in the North Scottsdale area actually wants quality Italian, try Spiga around the corner.  Your pallet and wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"Tomaso's new restaurant gives you the new modern feel with a touch of his classic 32nd and Camelback location. I had the Rigatoni, and it was phenomenal. I had the strawberries with the chocolates on top it for desert. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing \"authentic\" Italian food and impeccable service. I have been here now 8 times in the past month and each time I never leave unhappy. Tonight, Sal at the bar took care of me and did an outstanding job. He was knowledgeable of the food, offered suggestions and provided outstanding service. Thank you Sal, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, good  service but was a bit to pricey.

Beautiful decor and good ambiance. 

I had arugula pear & pecan salad, it was good. My husband had the veal pasta and was excellent!

The bread was freshly baked and delicious, thank you Tomaso!"}
{"text":"Came is here for dinner the other night. Our server was Susan, she did an amazing job. Food was great. Seasoned just enough to complement the true taste of the food. No one ingredient overpowering the rest. So hard to find good food and atmosphere that makes and Italian restaurant that is the way it should be. Maybe is not the the place for a quite dinner, but that robustness is how it should be!"}
{"text":"We loved Tomaso's restaurant!!  Wonderful wine list, food and service!! Rafael was our server and he was just great and he had just started working there 3 days before! All of their servers are mature so you are guaranteed good service........
I don't see how you couldn't love this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"We were familiar with the Camelback location, but only recently tried the north Scottsdale restaurant.
Our waiter was great, and the food was quite good, BUT: In terms of the whole package, it was sorely lacking. 
Ambiance: 0. Noise Level: High. 
Other than a few faux columns, it is a big boxy room, with hard surface flooring, tables that are pretty close together and no charm whatsoever.
There are so many other spots to get great Italian food...I would pass on this one - unless you don't care about ambiance, you are famished, and you happen to be in that shopping center.
Otherwise: keep driving!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed lunch at Tomaso's When in Rome today.  I was dining with three friends to celebrate a birthday.  My three friends ordered the Pear and Pecorino Raviolis and I ordered the Spaghetti Cacio de Pepe.  Both entrees were delicious.  The only negatives were the small portions and high prices.  Fresh bread and butter were provided.  We sampled two desserts, one similar to a creme brûlée and the other a pistachio gelato mixture.  Paola, our waitress, was efficient and attentive.  I was delighted to learn that she was from an area of Italy very near my relatives in Fermo.  It was disappointing to see that there were only three tables of customers for lunch.  The hot temperature may have had something to do with that.  The decor was stunning with comfortable seating.  Even though I was not thrilled with the small portions and high prices, I would definitely go back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The brand says it all. This new location continues its tradition of serving memorable quality plates and wines. Manager and co-owner came by the table to ensure the service is up to expectations and more. 

There was an error on the business hours on Google Maps but the manager and I fixed it on my phone. 

My gnocchi plate was fulfilling yet light. Will come again."}
{"text":"Excellent experience and restaurant. Lemondrop Martini was beautiful and delicious. Dinner was served hot and a pleasure to eat and look at. Service couldn't have been better. Tanya, our server, was helpful and gave us just the right amount of attention. We'll definitely be back when dining in this Scottsdale neighborhood."}
{"text":"After my recent first visit to Chef Tomaso's restaurant I am left awestruck and exceedingly amused.  So refreshing and rewarding to find such talent.  This is a definitive Restaurant, thank you Chef."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this restaurant.  Food was good, unfortunately salmon was delivered dry and over cooked.  When ordered Medium Rare.   So 3 of us ate and one waited.  New meal delivered after we were done eating.  No apology, no manager visit, no consideration on bill.  Waiter was abrupt and not friendly, was uninterested in us, or so it seemed.  Not sure we will visit in future and found not recommend."}
{"text":"Very Good.  
Warm & friendly atmosphere, very good food, pleasant employees.  I thought the waiter was a bit aggressive about over-selling the wine list, but overall, our party of four had a lovely experience.  Would definitely return.  They know what they're doing....."}
{"text":"Came during Happy Hour and sat at the bar- all night HH here! Love that.. but it is an upscale and higher dollar HH. Wine by the glass $8, Well drinks $7. Appetizers and a few pasta and other dishes for around $10 each. Highlights- spinach gnocchi (small portion, but incredible!!!!), grilled chicken Caesar salad, calamari. Nice atmosphere- ideal for a date. I don't eat pasta or Italian often, but when I do, I will be back."}
{"text":"Went there 2 times in the same week!  The calamari appetizer is sooooooo good! The tomato sauce tasted fresh and delicious.  The service was fantastic.  The decor was beautiful.  Great experience both times."}
{"text":"Tammy is a horrific server.  She had a snot rag in her hand while serving, didn't wash her hands afterwards, was lazy, didnt offer bread, had wet hands while serving.  The dinner came out and was luke warm, and she never asked how my dinner was. I will not be back of course.  Surprised I didnt get food poisoning.  The problem with this one is it has the prices of the Camelback store but quality of an Olive Garden.  Typical of valley restaurants...will be empty by March."}
{"text":"Menu is very limited, food is quite average, wine list is extensive but expensive, and atmosphere is like a Hotel convention facility turned eating area. Older crowd I guess doesn't care."}
{"text":"We live in North Scottsdale and are really enjoying this new addition to our dining choices.   We have been to the restaurant twice in the evenings in the past week for summer all-day Happy Hour, and highly recommend it.  Tonight with friends on a high-top table we were expertly served by the always-smiling Tanya, and greeted warmly by the very Italian hostess, Giorgia.  We had several glasses of the Italian Chardonnay plus excellent appetizers - Bruschetta, Gnocchi, meatballs - and a tiramisu for dessert."}
{"text":"Great salads & appetizers. Their seafood is fantastic. The seafood in the cioppino was amazing. However, the cioppino didn't have a traditional, flavorful broth/sauce that you'd want to dip your bread in. Rather, it was just olive oil with a reddish hue. Dessert was good. Though, no tiramisu on the menu, which was disappointing. I will always request Giuseppe for a waiter there as he is incredible. Though, I'll hope I don't get the same guy filling my water glass as I had this last time as I had to hold my breath each time he came to the table as he smelled as if he had bathed in cologne. Great restaurant & Giuseppe is a phenomenal waiter. My only hopes are that they improve the cioppino broth/sauce, improve the dessert menu, & the wait staff lay off the cologne."}
{"text":"AMAZING! From the thoughtful service, wonderful wine recommendations, and delightful food, this place went above and beyond to make my hubby and I feel special on our anniversary? dinner. Definitely? coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I would have gave this 5 stars but I agree with other reviews...TOO NOISEY!  They really need to fix this ASAP...I saw other people there that I knew and they said the same thing!  The tables are so close together you should just sit with neighbors!  

Jake, our waiter was great, food great but need to fix noise level if you want repeat business and ambience as there are plenty of places that have that here in North Scottsdale.  Keep customers coming back by removing some of the tables so we don't feel like we are on top of each other and you will get my business and keep others returning!  FOOD IS GOOD!!"}
{"text":"We were excited to see Tomaso's opening in north Scottsdale.  I don't write reviews, we own a business and we understand the importance of these...but I had to post this for others. My husband and I went for an early dinner at 5:45.  I was a little disappointed in the décor as it is a bunch of little tables and cheap chairs.  In fact the table for two are so so so small that I could not even sit my small clutch on the table without it sitting on my plate (I had to keep my purse in my lap).  We asked to be moved to a four top and they would not accommodate (the place was empty at that time.)  Later in the evening I saw a couple of two seated at a four top. 

In fact they had to take away the bread basket to accommodate the appetizer of calamari because of no room on the table. I guess if you want bread you have to keep that in your lap too. We kept scrambling to catch the salt and pepper shaker to make sure they did not crash to the floor. The calamari was sub-par and chewy.

I spoke with the waiter and asked for extra capers on my veal scaloppini francese with the lemon sauce, and my husband joked and told the waiter to add lots of capers (he knows I like them). I received veal scaloppini marsala instead.  When I told the waiter this was not what I had ordered, he said yes this is what I ordered.  I laughed and said \"well then....where are the capers?\" (Which would never be on a marsala dish to begin with.)  It was apparent that he did not know his menu well.  I accepted the dish anyway and found that it was very flavorless for marsala. 

 My husband ordered a shrimp and lobster dish that also lacked flavor and he ended up taking the rest of it home. He never does this and usually finishes up my meal too. The next day he threw the leftovers in the trash as he spent the next day sick.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Nice alternative in North Scottsdale.  Good meal - and good service.  Giuseppe was charming and attentive!

We had the filet ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs.  Very good - the meatballs were fantastic.  We also had the Sicilian cannoli for dessert.  We thought it was very good.

If you are looking for a quiet location, this isn't the place for you.  Loud, upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time here with the family and this quickly became our go-to place for Italian. We we're shown to our table promptly and greeted with some fresh baked bread and garlic butter with basil. Next was the extensive wine list and several specials. I chose from the menu and had the amalifitini. Amazing fresh fish with giant scallops. My wife had the perfectly cooked lamb chops and my daughter, the veal franchese.  Our waiter John took very good care of us and his assistant, Giovanni was excellent too. Must try this place"}
{"text":"Tried this place during restaurant week. Had the Lamb and my gf had the Lobster Ravioli. Portions were very generous. Tastes and flavor were amazing. Service was great even though they were busy. Great selection of wine and drinks. The dessert was very good. 
The decor was good. The location is good although its mainly an older crowd. 
Definitely recommending this to everyone around."}
{"text":"Happy house is noon to 6pm so you can even come durning lunch time. Highly recommend! Service at the bar was amazing. Food was off the charts."}
{"text":"Tried Tomaso's a couple of nights ago.  Much prefer Spiga which is less than mile away.  Much nicer ambiance, especially on the patio.  Food is better,  service is much, much better at Spiga.  (Prices better too!!)."}
{"text":"Dropped in for happy hour. Selected the meat balls, gnocchi and chicken Caesar. Every item was spot on- service was great."}
{"text":"Outstanding. 
Tried it for the first time tonight. The service was impeccable. Comfortable atmosphere. 
We were very impressed by the food. 
Everything we had was delicious from start to finish."}
{"text":"We tried the recently opened Tomaso's in North Scottsdale last night. The restaurant is inviting and beautifully decorated. To start, we shared an arugula salad with pears, pecans and Gorgonzola cheese. It was delicious. For entries, I had the Pappardelli with osso buco meat sauce, and my wife enjoyed the Spaghetti Caccio and Pepe. Both were exceptional. Our waiter, Jake, was very attentive. We will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"We've been going to Tomaso's in Phoenix since it first opened.  

Tonight was our first time at the newest location in North Scottsdale.  It did not disappoint.

The food was excellent with exceptional presentation.  We both chose the Lemon Veal Tenderloin, with fresh vegetables and potatoes.  The veal was served hot and was tender enough to cut with a fork.  The lemon aspect was lightly done and a perfect accompaniment to the veal.

We ordered the Creme Brule for dessert which was beautifully presented with lusty  berries on the side.  

I'm not giving them the full 5 starts for two reasons....1.  The setting sun was in the eyes of my dinner companion. This being Arizona, shades of some sort are in order.
2.  The noise level makes it difficult to have a conversation of any import.  I'm not sure how to fix this, but attention should be paid.  

We will be back."}
{"text":"One of the longest happy hours around, lasts all the way to 7pm.  And if you don't mind, the HH food choices make an adequate light meal.  I've gone there twice with the intention of having dinner in the dining room but never made it out of the bar.  So far everything I've had is excellent but I would request the restaurant to have more vegetarian options on the menu.  I have to order dishes and have them hold the meat and then I still have to pay full price.  Please offer the pasta dish plain and have the meat options be an add-on price like many places do."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Wednesday night- first impression is, of course, that the restaurant looks like an office building- which it is on the second floor.   Nice bar which has Happy Hour every day at which the bar and high tops were full.  
The interior was lovely but quite frankly it just seemed like one large room. The restaurant wasn't overly busy so we had some space between occupied tables.  
The service was very good- attentive staff.  
I typically order Salmon- which I did tonight, however, the Vegetarian Eggplant Torte sounded appealing which I'd like to try my next visit. 
Started off with the Caesar salad which was one of the freshest salads I have enjoyed - love when it is served on a chilled plate.  
The Seared Salmon was absolutely delicious- very well seasoned.  Hats off to the Chef.    
We also enjoyed one of the specials which was the Halibut which was also well prepared.  
No dessert tonight but they certainly sounded delicious!"}
{"text":"Was our first time at this restaurant and we went with high hopes.  Alas, we came away with just a \" MEH\" impression.  WhWas our first time at this restaurant and we went with high hopes.  Alas, we came away with just a \" MEH\" impression.  While many reviewers commented on a lack of atmosphere, we actually thought the ambiance was nice.  A few booths vs tables might have cozied it up and dampened the noise, but it was still pretty pleasant.   

Now, on to the food.  It was OK, but not great.  We had the calamari appetizer, something any Italian restaurant worth its salt should be able to make.  Alas, while it was tender and cooked well it was completely lacking in flavor.  Also, the marinara (?) sauce on the side tasted like just a cup of tomato puree.  The entrees were hit and miss.  I had the menage a tois  (lobster tail, shrimp and clams on squid ink pasta), and hubs had the salmon.  Here the pasta and roasted potatoes were very good, however, both the shrimp and lobster tail were over cooked, chewy and lacking any flavor.  The salmon was good, but nothing special.  

The wine list is limited, and a tad overpriced.

The service was good, if a bit inexperienced.

Overall probably won't go back since there are many other places that are better and more reasonably priced in the area.ile many reviewers commented on a lack of atmosphere, we actually thought the ambiance was nice.

{"text":"We had a party of 6 and dined there for dinner on June 6. Had reservations and were seated quickly. Ordered wine , only to learn they didn't have it. Ordered the 2nd bottle , it wasn't in stock either. They did have the 3rd. choice. Half the group then ordered Lasagna and later was advised by the waitress that they were out of Lasagna. We then ordered chicken parm. and after an excessive period of time it arrived. The waitress was excellent and did everything she could possibly do to make our experience good.She even offered us a complimentary bottle of wine. Overall, the food was good, however, the ambiance and apparent disorganization of the kitchen do not necessarily justify the pricing.Very brightly lighted and extremely noisy. Would recommend, however, would wait awhile to dine there. They will no doubt get it together."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm going back as soon as I can!! Yummy!! I was a lil intimidated knowing the success of the Camelback location and the reservation list, however when I dropped in for lunch, it was fast friendly and surprisingly affordable for the marvelous food I received! 

Sausage & mushrooms made me think this was going to be a heavy meal, when  in fact, it was just right! I probably could've eaten a bunch more of this, however I was fully satisfied!! Yum!!"}
