{"text":"Excellent endroit pour prendre un dîner santé! Grande variété de sandwiches, salades, et autres mets. Soupes et desserts délicieux. J'aime surtout la galette chocolat et figues, un dessert léger et pas trop sucré. Très occupé pendant l'heure du dîner. On se sent toujours bien après avoir mangé chez Avril!"}
{"text":"This is where I do most of my food shopping.  It's not really anywhere near \"Whole Foods\" gourmet style but this is the closest I have found.    There is a little eatery in front...where they sell Crudessence++.  But I got salmon pie there once and it tasted as if it had started to go bad.  Also, the smoothies are with frozen not fresh fruit, so I skip that.  Large produce department, limited/ fresh meat.  Most of the store is non perishables and supplements.  Which brings me to my point -- I'm docking one star because the produce often looks tired or dodgy.  Despite staff milling around there is always produce that looks terrible and or is rotted or rotting.    Again, I'm being a little picky -- there IS nice looking produce.  However, staff should get rid of bad produce.  I don't want to be picking through oranges for 5 minutes to find some nice ones or stumble on something on something bruised and covered in mold.  I would say that because of the price point, turnover is much less than say Adonis or Kim Phat both nearby.  Neither is an organic grocer...but the produce seems very fresh consistent with a high turnover rate.  The on-site staff is generally helpful...  But, on the telephone I got terrible customer service from the supplements department.  Even after explaining exactly which ingredients I was looking for in a natural sleep aid, the associate put me on hold, went to look then came back and said she couldn't find exactly what I wanted since one ingredient I had mentioned was missing -- she refused to even try and recommend a similar product.  It seemed to me by that point that she did not know her products very well.   And then after I told her that my husband was on his way there......... she still insisted that I have to come in in person (would this help her know her products better??)  I think that a customer showed up while I was on the phone but I was extremely annoyed to have wasted my time, only to be practically hung up on.  Either way I usually get my supplements in the US.  The selection is significantly bigger, prices are lower and everything can be purchased online, with fantastic customer service.    Now I'm waiting for my products to arrive from Vitacost in the US."}
{"text":"I love shopping here. Healthy food, food that is usually hard to find elsewhere, and the Avril café is pretty tasty! A good variaty for everyone! The staff is very friendly and helpful. I recommend this place for anyone who wants to eat healthy and shop healthy food!"}
{"text":"This isn't exactly the Whole Foods  we're used to in America but its definitely a great alternative! There's a huge selection of organic, gluten free, soy free foods & make-ups! Not to mention an amazing selection of supplements.   A recent visit here inspired me to go for a gluten-free diet. This store really makes it possible because they offer almost EVERYTHING in a gluten-style, even beer!   I have to admit some stuff is ridiculous e.i $12.99 for a standard plain yogurt is a bit outrageous... But for the most part it's worth the value!"}
{"text":"Service impeccable. Nous allons régulièrement au Avril de Longueuil surtout pour les suppléments naturel. Marie-Eve est d'une grande gentillesse et d'une écoute incroyable. Elle nous conseille toujours de manière courtoise et   avec professionnalisme. Je suis toujours étonné de voir à quel point elle connaît les produits et leurs bénéfices.   Merci Marie-Eve   Céline & Sergio"}
{"text":"This is where I do most of my grocery. It can get a bit pricey depending on what you get but the quality is good.It is a small health store where you can find practically everything you're looking for. I love getting organic fruits & vegetables. They sell \" Aux Vivres \" prepared meals for a quick eat.My favorite is the tempeh wrap !! Soo good. They also sell meal alternative, soy-free, gluten-free products, great for vegetarians/ vegans or people who care about their health. The store is well maintained and each section is labelled properly. They often run in-store specials or flyer specials."}
{"text":"Excelent store , beautifully decorated high quality everything is healthy there is absolutely nothing to complain about this store and there products, it's worth 100 star. But the employees wowww that's a whole different story , they purposely refuse to talk to you in English , all of them are separatists English haters , but come to think of it it's not there fault it's the fault of management , they hire illiterate people yes illiterate people who are born in Quebec Canada and don't speak 1 word of English . Come to think of  it I feel bad for this people who don't speak 1 word of English just imagine they go to Usa  or  Ontario or let's say England how do they get around :)))) oops sorry I forgot for them québéc is the world Vivre Le Quebec libre :)))))"}
