{"text":"Horrible service from the minute you walk in. The host doesn't even look up to greet you then he finally looks up and says \"how many\". We told him 6 and he said \"we are short staffed so there is a 15-30 minute wait\". They finally get us seated and we waited 15 minutes before the waiter came over to tell us ALL of his problems.   The dining room was half full. I would think they need to invest in some wait staff if they want to run a restaurant and pull the manager out to help out."}
{"text":"Service is pretty good. I've been to this location about 10x. Every time I come out to Phoenix I go here because it's pretty convenient to where I stay with family. I usually get the skinny margaritas, and at $10 a pop they aren't as strong as I'd hope they'd be. Not sure who thought it was a good idea to change the presentation, but I ordered two chicken tacos and they came out on a taco holder? Just put it on a plate. It only came with one tortilla instead of two, and my taco fell apart. I felt skimped. They also, put the beans and veggies in two separate small bowls. Seems like a lot more to clean for them and kind of a hassle for me. Can't you just put it all on one plate? Not as good as I remembered. Might look for other Mexican restaurants next time I come out because this place has changed...and not for the better."}
{"text":"***Macayo's seems to be a local Mexican restaurant chain, which makes it more unique than the other big chains located in Chase Field--Panda Express, Fatburger, Friday's; for ballpark food, Macayo's prices are reasonable with some dishes starting at $3 and full-size/shareable items available for less than $7***  There are a few Macayo's concessions stands located throughout Chase Field.  They are not as common as the traditional hot dogs and nachos stands so you may have to walk a little bit to find one of them.  Macayo's offers reasonably priced Mexican food concessions.  Macayo's is a chain in Arizona (I saw one of their standalone restaurants in Downtown Phoenix).  The menu includes burritos, quesadillas, tacos, etc.  I thought their prices were very reasonable.  They were doing a set of 4 mini chimichangas (seemed like a good size for sharing) that only ran $6.50.  I ordered some tortilla chips with spinach cheese dip and they only cost $3.  Typically, any nacho-like item at a sporting event is going to run at least $5.  The tortilla chips were good.  They were light, crispy and fresh.  The spinach and cheese dip was also pretty good.  It was reminiscent of a spinach and artichoke dip but with more of a cheese flavor (though this was not the best cheese flavor).  I also had a churro here and it was not good.  It was not warm and there was way too much cinnamon on the churro.  There was a pretty long line at this stand, but the line moved fairly quickly (food came out quickly after I put in my order).  Macayo's may be a chain, but at least it seems local to Arizona.  So if you like trying different and maybe even more local concessions when visiting a baseball stadium, the reasonably priced Macayo's is one to consider if you ever find yourself at Chase Field."}
{"text":"I like the Macyos  on central, the food is fresh  and delicious. Their real gem is Clayda! She is outgoing, pleasant, and very knowledgeable of the menu and specials"}
{"text":"Not too bad priced mex food at the ballpark."}
