{"text":"Was there a shortage of BBQ sauce today?  Thanks for the non-barbecue chopped salad CPK!!!"}
{"text":"The long line at CPK for a weekend dinner is testament to the triumph  of good location over mediocre food and not very good service by the  frazzled staff."}
{"text":"I got the Sicilian thin crust pizza. Yum. 15.49 for a small sized pizza (radius about 5\", so 10\" diameter). My man says the strawberry limeade was good, + they give free refills.  Cute holiday themed to-go box.  Kind of on the pricy side."}
{"text":"My husband & I loved going to CPK in Ca and were so happy to find one close by. I love the farmers market soup and love they offer half portions of their salads. aLL of which are phenomenal. My husband gets the sausage pepperoni mushroom pizza and it is to die for. Went tonight for dinner and the gal, can't remember her name, pretty blonde gal, was terrific! We will definitely continue our date nights at CPK! Fresh food and great service!"}
{"text":"CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this chain but have to call them out on the gluten free pizza crust. There is no excuse today, with all of the wonderful GF options available, to offer a sub par GF experience when you call yourself a Pizza Kitchen. The gluten free crust is horrible. If you can't do it right, don't offer a GF alternative. If you go try the GF pizza at True Foods for example you will see what I mean. They do it right. As a GF diner, things like pizza are a luxury, so when we get a bad one, we are very, very disappointed. I had issues with the take out service on this visit as well, but won't go there. Get the crust right or drop the offering!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic- especially the service! I went there for dinner with my family after graduation. The hostess set up a special sign saying \"Congrats Grad!\" behind my desk and actually refused to charge us!   The appetizers were my favorite: Baja and thai tortilla rolls and the  chicken tinga quesadilla. The guacamole and ranchitos sauce are delicious. We also had the jerk chicken pizza-- which is actually spicy for those of you who like are tired of 'hot' things not actually being hot. The kung pao spaghetti with chicken was very flavorful and the bread, as always, was just the right amount of crunchy and fluffy.   Would highly recommend this place for celebrating any special occasion. We've never felt like such an appreciated guests! Will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"This isn't a bad mark against this location, but rather the chain. I ordered a salad that cost $16 and it was so small. I was shocked at the size. I used to order that same salad a few years ago and it cost less and it was twice the size. The size of it now was about the same size I get other places that they bring before the meal. The service was good and friendly but I'm still hungry. I'm going to have to go get a hambuger."}
{"text":"I really like their thin crust pizzas. Parking at this location can be a pain."}
{"text":"My family is Gluten free.  This limits our selections.  However at CPK we still have a great selection and the staff is very knowledgeable about what gluten free means.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I recently went here for lunch. I was there during the week and was seated right away. The restauarnt was pretty busy, but I had great service. I enjoyed my chicken ceaser sandwich with a bowl of soup. My waiter was kind and attentive. My food came quick and the price was right for the amount of food I got."}
{"text":"I have never had better guest service than my first visit to California pizza kitchens tonight. Drew, our server was very upbeat and made many suggestions to help us out. He also alerted Jennifer the floor manager when our white pizza was not to our taste and she comped it off our bill. I work in food and know how frustrating it can be to encounter guests who expect service like this just because they do not like how their food tastes, which is not the fault of the dish, cook, or servers, but simply an unfortunate menu choice, and to have it removed from our bill and accompanied by complimentary desert was a greatly appreciated gesture delivered by Drew and Jennifer tonight. Great food doesn't keep guests coming back like great hospitality and service does, both of which we had tonight. Thanks Drew and Jennifer. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Overall is good. The vegi pizza is fresh. The pasta is pretty good. They also offer extra saurce for it."}
{"text":"I have gotten curbside service about 10x over the last 5 years. The curbside service is convenient. The staff is friendly and prompt.   I love the Waldorf and Thai Chicken salads. But I don't see them on the online menu anymore and if this is the case then I wouldn't give 4 stars. The pizza is ok but it only comes in one size and seems kinda small for the price.  The only thing is: last time the server asked if I wanted my change. I felt like she was outright asking me if I would give her a tip, and it was awkward."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience and will never be going back to cpk ever again. Very rude and unprofessional staff with some weird attitude.  Went to take out to pick up my order. Someone came over started helping me out with my order half way through when he picks up the phone and starts helping someone else. Phone call lasts over 10 minutes while I'm standing there ready to pay for my order. Word of advice, finish one customer/transaction at a time. By the time I got my pizza home it was cold from me standing in line so long."}
{"text":"This is an easy place to pick for lunch with my work friends.  They offer a nice selection of salads where even a half order is too much for one person - like other reviewers, the caramelized peach is my favorite.  Artichoke and spinach dip is always tasty, pear / gorgonzola pizza is delicious, the new bianco flat bread is tasty, and my lunch companions always get different salads and pizzas and are always pleased.  They did switch to sourdough bread for a start - not my favorite but theirs isn't too powerful.  I liked the herb oil but that didn't get to our table with the last visit so it might be out already.  Parking is easy, at least until they replace On the Border which is across the \"street\" and the best place to park when you visit.  Service is mostly good but we have had a couple of bad experiences, not enough to change my opinion though.  Ask for salad dressing on the side if you're concerned about getting too much, I'm not a fanatic but they load it at times and it will turn a nice salad into a drippy slaw.  The guy that manages this place during the day does a great job and always looks tired, I would too if I had to deal with running a place like this.  It's a chain and and a tad overpriced...that being said, it's a pretty good option when you can't figure out what else to do.  A true 3.5 but I'll round it up for how hard they try."}
{"text":"After a morning of running errands, my girlfriend and I stopped into California Pizza for a quick lunch. We sat on the patio (so we could people watch) and ordered our pizzas (Hawaiian and Wild Mushroom, both thin crust). Although we got mediums, they were pretty big but since thin crust isn't so filling we managed to scarf down a few slices each.   Both pizzas were tasty in their own way, the Hawaiian had the perfect amount of saltiness and sweetness from the ham and chucks of pineapple and the Wild Mushroom had a hearty serving of mushrooms with romano & mozzarella cheese drizzled with truffle oil.   I like that you have an option for thin crust, I think pizza tastes better that way!"}
{"text":"California Pizza Kitchen was a really great restaurant.  Pizzas were very exotic they had toppings that are not what you usually eat on pizza.  California Pizza kitchen was upbeat, modern, and a fun place to be but it was not in any way overwhelming.                                           The service at California Pizza Kitchen was wonderful while I was there.  When we walked in we were greeted  nicely by two very  kind employees and seated at our table.  Our waiter  was extremely friendly and patient with us.                 The menu at California Pizza Kitchen included many options of salads, pastas, various main courses, and last but not least, pizza! The pizza at California Pizza Kitchen was exotic and delicious.  It had various things on the pizza that would not usually be put on pizza.  My grandfather had a pizza called a Thai pizza that had Thai chicken, bean sprouts, ginger, garlic, carrots, greens, cheese, and peanut sauce.  My pizza was the roasted garlic chicken pizza.  I do have to say that the chicken on my pizza was a little bit dry I think it could've been marinated a little more.  My onions were caramelized but I think that they could have been in the pan a little bit longer.  Other than that my pizza was great.  I recommend it.                        California Pizza Kitchen's kid's menu has lots of options. The menu has various options including Hawaiian pizza, mac and cheese, hot dog, and more. Kid's menu orders come with the inexpensive option of an ice cream sundae.                        The pizzas at CPK are sized for one person so that everyone can have their own or share several.                         The ambiance at CPK is modern and upbeat but not overwhelming. Everything was cleaned well and taken care of.  I didn't feel rushed to eat and leave. It was a Sunday night and slightly loud but not horrible.                          I loved California Pizza Kitchen. The service is great, the menu offers lots of options and it's perfect for families with kids."}
{"text":"Solid, dependable, and good.  What more do you want from a National Chain?  Get the BBQ Chicken Pizza for a great choice.  Their apps are pretty good too.  Best part about this location though is the \"curbside to go\"  Love not having to get out of the car!."}
{"text":"Went for the BBQ chopped chicken salad, boyfriend had a tomato/cheese pizza. The appetizer we ordered Thai chicken spring rolls were very good, enjoyed the spicy peanut, yet the salad lacked their standard bbq dressing and the tomatoes were cut in different sized cubes. Disappointing. The pizza was just okay"}
{"text":"Ate there on Jan 11th. We had a snowbird friend visiting.  She wanted to sit outside on the patio. They turned the heaters on for us even though nobody else was out there.  Our server was amazing. His name was Christian. He was very attentive and helpful.  He brought out bread before dinner and some wine samples. My husband did order some wine. My skinny friend wanted the children's pizza and the waiter said ok. I want to be skinny so I ordered the Thai salad. It was actually really fresh. I'm a salad snob so I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was good but I'm giving them 5 stars for service.   I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Different experience for me at this location than from the Vegas one. Salads looked delicious, fresh, and was tasty. The soup I had was just different, and the guacamole, if you are expecting avocados, lacks in avocado content. There are plenty of peppers in it, though. At this location, service was slow, never got a water refill, the server was inattentive, and the person who brought the food was argumentative, thinking he was being funny. Won't return here."}
{"text":"Been here many times, but this last visit was surprisingly good.  I usually get the wild mushroom pizza, but noticed a wild mushroom pasta so figured I'd give it a shot.  It was great.  The mushrooms were very flavorful, and the sauce was rich and garlicky, and the pasta was cooked just right.  Service was ok - it wasn't busy and we still got handed off 2 times, and we had the Szechuan dumplings as an appetizer and it lacked flavor.  Would definitely be back for the pasta and some of our other regular selections like the tequila lime chicken fettuccini."}
{"text":"Love this place. Christian and Craig are the best! Ask for them. They will make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Ordered from CPK pickup and the hostess Marilyn was great and very personable! Always a good experience picking up curbside at CPK"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times over the past few years--most recently yesterday for lunch with my family. To start, I'm bummed that the foccacia bread with tomatoes are now off the menu--what?! that was the BEST. I do a low-carb diet, and when I knew we were going to CPK, I saved my carb calories just for that! Bummer.  Hostess was nice--let me sit in our booth before the entire party arrived (crazy construction traffic on the 101--what?!).  Booth and silverware was clean....food was great, as usual.  We ordered a trio of salads---Miso, BBQ chicken, and Chinese Chicken Salad. Generous portions--I swear that half is almost the same size as the full! Our drinks never saw the bottom of the glasses---attentive waitress.  Bummer #2--I KNEW I had left my cell phone/case at the booth as soon as I drove away, and I went to check and they took my name and number and said they'd call if they found it. I KNOW I left it there, so after an hour I called back. Whoever I spoke with was kinda testy and rude--that pissed me off.  All ready to boycott this place for the rest of my being, at 904pm I got a phone call from a much-nicer manager, telling me they had scoured our booth finally and, voila, there appeared my belongings! I heart that nice man---and the boycott is now off."}
{"text":"Today me and my boyfriend ate at this location I had the jamaican chicken pizza with glaze it was very sweet I thot it could of used more marinara so our waiter ceil was very outgoing and polite she accommodated us both with free extra marinara sauce it made the pizza much better. My boyfriend on other hand originally ordered the toastada pizza with black bean chips lettice and much more. It didn't have alot of flavor or cheese. So we let Ceil know about the taste of the pizza. Ceil was very polite she let her manager know and they offered my boyfriend a new order for a new pizza that he would like. They didn't charge him for the old pizza he didn't like because they wanted him to be satisfied.  I also ordered the tortilla soup it was spicy and thick very delicious.  At the end of our meal the manager offered me the soup for free. I would highly recommend this location to others the workers and manager is very professional and polite they also serve the food quick."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving this a 4/5 is solely BASED on the amazing service provided to my family and I when we went for dinner on Wednesday night. Erika Elizabeth was truly the most entertaining, friendly and family oriented waitress I've ever had! She made bad food situations an easy transition by offering other options. We understand she is not the chef so she is not to blame. But the food that night was completely disappointing, that would be considered at 2/5 stars. My family ordered salad and the lettuce tasted like metal and super bland, the soup was clumpy and luke warm. But even with that being said, she made the experience truly comical and friendly. Thanks so much Erika, even with the not so tasty food that night....we will still come back and try it out again. So long as you are our waitress! :)"}
{"text":"Food is decent.  Hubs really enjoys CPK.  I'm not as big of a fan but it's all right.  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice.  Great kids menu and booth seating which is perfect for us so 4 stars it is!"}
{"text":"Great food, helpful staff and an awesome private dining space for private dinners and/or parties, it can seat up to 60!! We booked them for a private party of 25, great room and the A/V equipment was easy to use."}
{"text":"Ordered take out at CPK at Desert Ridge last night. Was not a good experience. For almost $52.00 2 salads, 1 mushroom pizza & a flatbread. First off the salads were a mess. Cobb salad had hardly any chicken on it. You had to search for it. The mushroom- spinach flatbread had absolutely no flavor. I didn't even see a mushroom on it. And my friends pizza for $15.00 was on pan crust. It was so thin I would hate to see what their actual thin crust is like. Hadn't been to CPK in years & have to say I don't see me ever going back. Better pizza at Dominos!"}
{"text":"Moscow mule is served in a proper copper mug. Pizza is dank. Servers are cool. I dig the place. Would return."}
{"text":"It smells like a sewer!  It's also very dirty- salad plates had bits of salad stuck to them, crumbs all over floor and tables. Food was typical of CPK - XL portions of saucy food. Server was nice."}
{"text":"I love California pizza kitchen, they have the best macaroni and cheese here. I always have good service and the prices are good.I definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Good food and good service every time I eat here.  It's all anyone wants when we dine out and this particular CPK gets it right."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place at desert ridge.  The food is great and delicious   Love it!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I just love the BLT PIZZA! Never have had a bad experience.  Clean, busy and fun! My kids love it too.  And the kids Mac and cheese is yummy too especially on the pizza!"}
{"text":"My son and I go to this cpk when we're shopping at Desert Ridge.  I usually have a salad, and they're consistently good/fresh.  My son usually has the kids pizza meal and a kids sundae (which he reluctantly shares with me).  It's inexpensive and I've always received unexpectedly good service."}
{"text":"I haven't been to CPK in a long time.   But it's almost exactly as I rememered. I kind of wanted to stay away from here for the longest time after I started seeing their pizzas in the frozen aisle at the grocery store.   I figured they probably just had frozen pizzas in the back and they reheated it.   Maybe that is the case. I'm not sure. But it still tastes good.  I came here for lunch and was acknowledged pretty quickly and immediately sat down.   The server was very attentive. I got the Sicilian pizza. Muy bueno.   I should come back more often!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and the Moroccan chicken salad. The pizza was fine, nothing to complain about or rave about   I ordered the salad with grilled chicken rather than the seasoned chicken that it comes with. In the past I felt the seasoning overpowers the salad.  I smelt the garlic on the chicken as it approached the table.  The vegetables were fresh and tasty. The heavily garlic laden chicken took away from the salad. Next time I order the salad I will specify no added spices on the grilled chicken.   Walked out with a mouth full of gum in an attempt to  overcome garlic breath ....... Was not successful Garlic roared out of my mouth like a dragon breathing fire."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Not sure why this location is consistently bad with regard to service."}
{"text":"CPK catered our playgroup event, and what a terrific job they did!  Their people were charming and all the food was delicious, especially the linguine, the Thai chicken pizzas, and the wild field greens salad with candied nuts."}
{"text":"CPK has revamped their entire menu and we are continually pleased with their new dishes we try. Tonight we celebrated my brothers birthday, for a few apps and a bunch of entrees obviously. The Mac and cheese bites, egg rolls and lettuce wraps were great.  New dish - Carne Asada pizza, so yum!  My fave salad - roasted veggie. Half is big enough to fill me."}
{"text":"Liked it very much. The ambience was good and staff was extremely courteous and friendly.. Tried hummus and spicy chipotle pizza , and both were very good.."}
{"text":"Tucked away in Desert Ridge, and near the kids play area, is CPK.  You know what you are getting with CPK, they are all the same! This location had friendly staff and was clean.  I loved my Sangria and carmelized peach salad.  My husband had the Moroccan salad and loved it.  My kids loved their pizzas and sundaes.  This isn't the fanciest restaurant in Scottsdale but it gets the job done for families who are hungry!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to update my review for a while.  The last few trips to this CPK have been very successful and for me that deserves an extra star.  They are also very accommodating.  I had to change a few items due to my diet (yes, back on it) and they were great.  I noticed a few new items and I had one of the moms order it.  It looked great and she said it was delicious.  CPK also catered one of our Parenting Group's event.  They did a fantastic job and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Not too bad! I tried the \"cheese burger\" pizza today. very good! the crust is a little too much like bread though and less like pizza, which I think is a trademark of Cali Pizza. On the down side, WAYYYY to expensive for what you get. Competing pizza joints that serve up \"the goods\" have them beat hands down for price VS quantity and maybe even quality. Barrows is very good and so is Rosatti's, although they can be a bit pricey too."}
{"text":"We eat here quite often because it is close to our home and they offer several dishes  that do not contain milk products.  They even list out every single item online with the most common food allergies such as gluten, eggs, milk, nuts etc. which is the main reason I go back.   I prefer to go to the CPK on Scottsdale/Shea and here is why:  I have ordered the Carmelized Peach Salad via take out and they forgot the peaches. Called up the manager who apologized and said he would refund me, well he never did. On 2 occasions I have felt a little sick after eating the Carnitos Tacos. The location on Shea makes them taste unbelievable but this location is slacking. I've been back to order salads, but after you see slimy-past it's expiration date-lettuce, it becomes quite a turn off. All in all, we really do like the food, but I definitely think it's hit or miss with the quality control."}
{"text":"I love CPK.  I have had great experiences at the CPK in Chandler and Scottsdale.  However, this location scorned me twice.    I always, always, always order the Tricolore Salad with the dressing on the side.  It's so good!  When I went to this location several weeks ago, I noticed that I was skimped on arugula, and a lot of it was wilted.  The salad was mostly those thick red leaves I don't like.  Last night, again, they skimped on arugula and it just didn't seem like a fresh salad.    Keep in mind, between those two visits I had the same salad at the Chandler location and it was delicious.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Great service, super clean, and tasty pizza. Can't go wrong here. CPK is always consistent no matter where we go. The one thing I have noticed is that the prices seem to be ever increasing. I'm not sure why--it's the same food.    My son and I enjoyed the Avocado Club eggrolls for an appetizer. They were quite tasty and a meal in and of themselves. We shared the Works pizza. It was hot, fresh, and perfect. I love a nice crispy crust. Our server was attentive and kept our drinks refilled. The restaurant was spotless and the bathroom was even well kept.   Best part? The kid paid for my meal. He's a good young man. We will come back to CPK and thanks for a fun experience."}
{"text":"We came here the other night after seeing the movie, Argo.  If you haven't seen the movie, we would highly recommend it.  Since we only come on late Friday nights, we were surprise to read all the three star reviews.  You see, at 7:30 or 8:30 the place is usually three quarters empty.  We tend sit in the dining area next to the bar, while most of the wait staff is trying to keep busy by making busy.  Our usual, is sharing a chopped salad (the best) and one of their pizzas.  Sometimes we'll try one of their appetizers, as we did on our recent visit (see photos). And, we still haven't forgiven CPK for taking the Santa Fe (SW Chicken) off the menu!  But, we've found some other menu items that fill us.    I'll acknowledge that sometimes they'll forget the sourdough bread, or miss a refill on a drink, but we've never had problems at this restaurant.  The food and service is good (at least at this hour).  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I usually come to CPK with the kids.  Most times the staff is right on the ball and brings out some bread right away, which helps a lot when you've got some starving kids with you.  The kids menu is also good, and the brocollini option for $1 is a great deal.  They have quite a few vegetarian options on the menu, which is good for the little lady, and I really dig the mushroom pizza."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for the wonderful experience for my son Sam!!! Manager Chris was so helpful and kind to my son and the others who came from the special program to make pizzas!!! Due to all of my child's food allergies he has never gotten to eat at a traditional restaurant , but this will be a new fun thing for us to get to do now as a family!!! Allergies were taken very seriously, and that in itself is VERY appreciated..... And that the staff put up with my slightly noisy kiddo...:-)) I will definitely be coming again, and also with grandma, who has some of the same food allergies as Sam..... If he could speak, I am sure he as well would have said thank you so very much..:-))  Sarah"}
{"text":"The food here is always great, but today the service was extra amazing. Jana was our waitress and she was extremely pleasant and helpful from the beginning. When we didn't like our pizza she was so accommodating and was an amazing advocate for us, getting our pizza removed without question. She was an amazing start to the weekend and a great smiling face at our favorite pizza spot!"}
{"text":"Food here is mediocre and tastes super artificial. I ordered the turkey club thinking I couldn't go wrong but it was pretty gross. The meat tasted cheap and the bread had little flavor, pretty hard to do with herb cheese focaccia bread. Same goes for the tortilla soup, tasted like cornmeal.   The decoration of CPK is okay but it kind of feels like an Ihop.   Service was good, though.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Note to self:  The P in CPK stands for Pizza... not Pasta.  Ordered the Jambalaya fettuccine and the tequila fettuccine.  Both sauces/proteins were good, but pastas (one plain and one spinach) were a serious downer.  Oddly, undercooked - sorta tasting a little like what you get at home when you try to use stale pasta from a box.  I realize at $17-18 a plate, no one is gonna make you fresh pasta, but Olive Garden serves better fettuccine than this.  The pizzas are always pretty solid, but at this price point, Picazzos is a better option.  Good kids choices though, and that does keep us visiting once in a while."}
{"text":"I love coming to this location but this experience with our friends was not great because of the service the waitress was not good . Waited so long for food and my pizza was cold . Took forever to bring condiments and she  just seemed passive aggressive.  Don't get the short ribs they are so nasty 5 of us tried it was so bad"}
{"text":"it has been a while since i have been there - - went for lunch and had the chicken tequila - - it was as good as it used to be.  great new menu choices and still good as ever."}
{"text":"Since the weather was pretty rough and we were suppose to go fishing at night. And the daughter had a CPK urge. We decided to stop off here! First, you have to walk a little bit from the parking lot. CPK is located at the intersection. We were seated very quickly, but it took forever to get our order in! Seems like they were under staff! Daughter order the tortilla soup, first problem was the spoon was dirty, glad she noticed that. Soup was very good, had no problem with that. I had the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine! Sounded good. It was a little to sweet, pasta was good and the chicken had a lot of flavor. Glad I tried it, but will not have it again. Daughter had what I wanted in the first place! She had the Garlic Cream Fettuccine! I had a couple of bites! Love the garlic flavor, and the creamy sauce! Next time! Over all the server was very nice! Just the time to get our order in was bad."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst place I've eaten a long long time. The food was at best bland. The service. Oh did we have any?  The price $$$$.  Never again."}
{"text":"Good food but pricing to high for portions. My salmon was cooked too much for a cool salad."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place based on the last waiter we had.  His hair is buzzed, looks a little muscled up Hispanic waiter.    Before he actually started working there I would give this restaurant a 4 or even 5.  However we've had the abysmal experience of having him as much as 3x and each time the same result.  Horrific service.   The last time we went there was to take my family out to dinner..they just flew in from out of state.  Imagine my excitement to take them to a good meal.  As soon as we saw him I knew we were doomed.  We should have walked out or just said flat out we wanted to be in a section where he was not serving (which I've never had to do before).   We ordered 2 appetizers and 5 main dishes (2 mahi mahi tacos, 2 Thai chicken pizzas and ribeye steak).  We were awaiting for our food quite a while and then we sensed it... He was going to bring the appetizer WITH the meal.  After a 20 minute wait (the restaurant was not busy) appetizer is brought to the table and 10 seconds later the main course.  We all kept quiet except my husband who asked 'isn't the appetizer supposed to be brought with the meal?' To which Our delusional waiter replied oh so arrogantly 'it is if you specify'.  Oh..was it MY job as the paying customer to SPECIFY?  I didn't know I worked at CPK! Anywhere where else I've been (and I've been to A LOT of restaurants in the US and overseas) the appetizers are brought in first or THEY ASK if I wanted it brought out first or with the the meal.  I thought that was THEIR JOB and not mine.  The Tuscan hummus and the lettuce wraps were not fresh by the time they served it by the way and we didn't even touch the latter dish.  My dad had ordered the ribeye which they seemed to be so proud of but that was eclipsed by the LACK OF SERVICE from our so called waiter.    He did not bother asking how we liked our meal...it was the manager who checked on us.  He also did not bother refilling our drinks..my sister had to flag down another waiter because our waiter was working the bar chatting it up with co workers.   The next time our waiter came by he dropped off the desert menu..that was it.  I usually tip 20 to 25 percent.  Our bill was $108 dollars and I left a 16 dollar tip which was too much for what service he failed to do.    So this guy (I think his name was narcissus?)  has managed to tarnish my impression of this restaurant.  The next time if we ever go back.. We WILL ask to be seated at a different section where he is not serving.  The other 4 different waiters we've had were very competent.  So hats off to you!  For giving my family a \"warm\" welcome to the Valley!  :)"}
{"text":"Going into this restaurant, I had really high hopes. I mean, I've had their personal pizzas on multiple occasions while waiting in the airport. So, I knew the food would be good. It only stands to reason that the actual restaurant would be nothing short of amazing, right? Sadly, no.  My daughter and I decided to stop in after a nice long play date nearby. When we arrived, it was 2:00 in the afternoon. The restaurant was almost completely empty. We were immediately seated, which was nice.  From there, however, things kind of went downhill.  Once we were seated, we sat...and waited...and waited. In a restaurant where there were FAR more servers than there were patrons, you'd figure that the service would have been a little better.   But, here's the kicker. Since the place was so empty, it made overhearing conversations among the servers pretty easy. As we sat and waited for someone to come and see us, I could overhear the servers arguing over who was going to help us. I know what you're thinking...maybe they were seeing whose turn it was for fairness' sake. No, these servers might as well have been drawing straws to see who got the short one. Nothing like feeling like a burden to set your dining mood.  All of that time to sit and think ended up shedding some light on another negative thing. The plates they provided at the table still had some food caked on them. Had I not had all of that free time to sit and look around, I might not have noticed it as readily.   As expected, the food was still fantastic. We went the safe route and got the margherita pizza. Thin crust, and delicious! Our pizza ended up being plenty for two of us to share, and only set us back about $16 with two drinks.  I really wish I could rate this place higher, because I really do enjoy their pizza. But my experience with the service was downright unpleasant. I'll stick to picking up their personal pizzas from the airport. That way I know I'll be getting a good pizza, but I won't have to worry as much about unexpected shoddy service. I mean, it's almost to be expected when you order fast food...so at least it won't be a surprise."}
{"text":"Stopped here again due to an Amex coupon, never mind that I had forgotten the card and ended up paying with 2 gift cards I had that I had gotten from my Amex rewards, I think.  Anyway, we got there after a movie, Saturday night around 8:30pm. We got there and no one was by the door, but a young hostess quickly approached us and I promise she seemed honestly happy to see us : ) We asked for a booth and got one of the 2 person ones. We don't like those much because we like sitting next to each other, we stayed there but mainly what I didn't like is that there is no wall and there is no privacy if someone else is seating on the other side of the divider.  Our server approached us and took our drink orders, we were not ready to order and she had to come back a couple of times. After that service was a little slow but she was nice and friendly.  Hubby had water and I had the cranberry cooler (cranberry juice with seltzer water, free refills). She was very prompt with the refills.   Appetizers - We had the lettuce wraps with chicken, they were really good, with shiitake mushrooms and water chestnuts. Hubby had the garlic foccaccia bread and it was very good too.  Then we decided to share a Jambalaya, with the shrimp on the side because hubby does not like shrimp. It sounded really good because it comes with chicken, shrimp, craw fish and Andouille sausage.  Pasta was a little undercooked for my taste, and our server offered to order a new one, but we were in a little hurry and decided to just keep it.  I thought the Jambalaya had an overwhelming spice, but I do not know what it was. IT was OK though, not awesome. The shrimp, on the other hand, was very tasty and I liked it a lot.  We closed with a Key lime pie. Key lime pie has become our favorite lately and this one was fairly good."}
{"text":"Though this CPK isn't close to our home, it was worth it to drive the longer distance to come here to host our daughter's birthday party at this CPK location at Desert Ridge because the the Scottsdale CPK management couldn't be bothered to have the courtesy to respond to us. Desert Ridge CPK customer service was infinitely better- we worked with Chelsie, one of the assistant managers, who was professional and responsive to all of our emails and phone calls. On the day of our event, the CPK staff was very efficient and prompt with their service, and the pizzas and ice cream sundae were excellent- the kids were all smiles and loved their meal! Thank you Desert Ridge CPK, and thank you Chelsie for all of your help in making our daughter's birthday special. It is evident this location takes pride in what they do. We will gladly drive out of the way to return to this CPK again, because of the excellent customer service they provided."}
{"text":"First of all....a big fat thank you to CPK! We showed up with no reservations and a group of 9. They sat us almost immediately, and gave us great service.   The BBQ chicken pizza was very good and the Cobb salad is one of the best salads in town. They could have a little better beer selection, but it is a restaurant and not a bar.   We have eaten at just about every CPK location in the valley, and they all rock. If you have never eaten at one, do yourself a favor and try something new.  PS, split a pizza and salad and you will be happy. Their garlic chicken pasta is also very good."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience from start to finish! My boyfriend and I are new to the Scottsdale area and were looking for a place to enjoy a relaxing and delicious meal. It has been a long week of unpacking and getting situated with our new jobs lol. This location was located in a beautiful shopping and dining area called the district. Being Friday night, the parking lot was packed and traffic was heavy, but we didn't mind. It was to be expected. California Pizza Kitchen has always been a go to place of ours when we want something we know will be yummy and worth our money. As soon as we walked in, the Hostess Laura greeted us warmly and sincerely. Her demeanor was calm but confident, and her smile was contagious. As she showed us to the table, she actually took the time to ask us how we were enjoying our evening and make pleasant conversation. She waited till we were seated to hand us our menus (loved that!) explained how it was free to join their rewards program, and that David our server would be right with us. David was absolutely incredible!! Super friendly and funny from the beginning. He was professional and knew the menu very well, but also made you feel comfortable. He recommended an Alaskan lager instead of the Sam Adams Winter lager because they didn't have it for my boyfriend. He loved it! And a strawberry sweetened ice tea for myself. It was out of this world! Definitely getting it every time I go from now on lol. He checked on us often, refilled our drinks, and made sure our meal was tasting great when it arrived. It was delicious as always of course. My boyfriend had the jambalaya and I had the pesto cream penne. David also took the time to add our meal to my boyfriends rewards credit after he had signed up. All together, this was THE best experience we've had from start to finish when dining out! Can't wait to go back! Ask for David if you ever decide to dine at this location! He made our week."}
{"text":"Last night, I went with some of my friends to this location to catch up and have dinner. The service was terribly slow. We would ask our waitress for the simple things such as a refill or a drink and it would take 10+ minutes to get the job done. The manager had to come and check on us which shouldn't be the case at all. It was to the point that when we were done with our food we had to stack the plates and put them to the side because they sat in front of us for 20+ minutes. On top of it all, we asked for a box and that even took long. We had to ask for our check instead of having our check giving to us. We literally had to demand stuff to get out of this restaurant. We got there at 7pm and we didn't get out until around 845 pm. Definitely won't be recommending this restaurant to anyone. I'll stick to the frozen California Pizza...it's much better!"}
{"text":"Ate here for my first time today and had the best service I've ever experienced. Josh was the server who was amazing and the manager came and greeted us after! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I had a pasta that I asked the waiter to pick out. It was amazing. The staff was great even if I did come in 30 minutes before close and they didn't try to push us out the door although we were the only customers in the restaurant. Love this place I will be going back."}
{"text":"Stealing a quote from Thomas S on this one:  \"CPK. Creative. Pizzas. Kinda.\"  When CPK was first introduced, it was so popular... I'd even go so far as to call it a chain that was worth a visit every now and then... Unfortunately, it's gone down hill since then.  It now seems overpriced and service is shotty.  Although the food is decent, there are so many other places to go...   My most recent visit was to this location (the one at Desert Ridge).  I met a friend for lunch and our waiter was nice but not very attentive.  We could've used drink refills on several occasions and our food seemed to take forever to arrive.  We both ordered the grilled veggie salad.  I added shrimp to mine and Tom added salmon to his.  He complained about the amount of salmon in his salad, but my shrimp was decent.  We went with the full portion instead of the lunch portion - good thing because we both cleaned our plates.  When it was time to pay, our waiter once again seemed to take forever!  All in all, this is a consistent chain pizza place - most anyone will find something to enjoy on their large menu, but it is what it is... a chain.  Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight for a family birthday. There was 9 of us and we had a blast! Great food, drinks, and service. In honor of National Sangaria day we tried the sampler flight. It's was good but very sweet. Was good to share! They also serve complimentary bread and oil with some herbs that is very good.   I got the roasted chicken with seasonal vegetables and it was incredible! Chicken was made to perfection with a crisp skin and had a garlic, lemon, wine sauce. I didn't want it to end!!! Amazing healthier option with a ton of flavor. My brother in law got the cedar wood salmon and it was delicious. We got a variety of options that were also good such as pizza, salad, pasta, and cheese crisp.   We finished off the night with the butter cake with ice cream on top for my mother in laws birthday. It was like heaven in your mouth. I don't think I have ever tasted anything so amazing. It was perfect to pass around the table and have a few bites but honestly I could of ate the whole thing. But moderation is key... lol  Overall great experience and I am excited to go back. Highly recommend trying the roasted chicken and the butter cake if you have a sweet tooth. My mouth is still watering for more!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to many different CPK locations. This is the worst of them. I do not know if it was an off night or what. But our server Dee, did his best with what he got to work with.   1. Ordered drinks, no problem. Just out of lemons for the ice tea. When our drinks came, the long island ice tea had a lemon on it but not the regular ice tea. After 1 min, our friend notice a hair stuck to the inside of her glass on the long island. She was freaked out. They replaced her drink and apologized.  The replacement long island has a lemon.  Hum, out of lemons?  2. Tried to order appetizers, they are out of the avocado club egg rolls, tortilla spring rolls, and Singapore shrimp rolls. We ordered the chicken pot stickers. The server was not sure if they had any left, he had to check. We were lucky, they had some pot stickers left.   3. We ordered our pizzas and was informed it is a 20 min wait.   Not once a manager stopped by to check our visit. Especially with the hair issue. Food was good, service was good, managing the restaurant's supply for food sucks (out of food), and management for customer satisfaction was lacking. No coming back to this location again. The Biltmore location is my favorite."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to California pizza kitchen, I have an average to above average experience. Maybe it's Because I love their food, but I've never had a bad wait staff. Almost always do I start with the avacado egg rolls, because they are to die for. There is all different styles of food that I really think can satisfy anyone's cravings."}
{"text":"Pretty good local restaurant. Has a great Asian Plumb Martini!  Expensive and they dont do specials... seriously?? a chain that doesn't do specials?  come on"}
{"text":"Desert Ridge is probably one of the ultimate locations for a CPK.  Every time I have been here they are extremely busy, especially during the lunch hours.  The pizza here is pretty decent, but my favorite item on the menu is the Waldorf Chicken salad with the dijon balsamic dressing. MMMMMM. I could eat this salad every day of my life. The apples and the grapes in it are so refreshing. The last time I visited I tried the Cherry Lime Sparkler, which is the adult version of a Cherry Limeade, I guess. It was also really great.   Although they are known for their pizza, I have to say that there are many better things on the menu. It may just be a personal preference, though.   Anywho, I love CPK and I will continue to go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"I travel for work all over and I go to a lot of CPKs, as I love it. Tonight I had probably one of the best Thai pizzas I've ever had at a CPKs. Some locations hardly put any chicken on it and not much ingredients at all, this one was perfect.  I get mine with no cheese, because I don't like cheese. I also get the olive oil and balsamic to dip the crust in.  I have been to this location several times and I have always had a great pizza and the food here. Fast good service, great people working at this location. Will be back soon! Keep up the good work. I read some of the reviews about service not being up to par at this location ?? I've been here about eight times never had bad service not sure what they're talking about. All people have bad days once in a while, I'm sure you're not real great at work every day either."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister's this past weekend and we all enjoyed a different salad.  I had my usual Original Chopped Salad, while one sister had the Mediterranean Salad and the other had a Caesar Salad.  All salads were delicious, but the service left a little to be desired -- our waitress was very frazzled and wasn't very attentive.  I will say the portions were bigger than what I was used to getting at CPK's in California and Nevada, though, so you might want to order a half salad here."}
{"text":"I come all the time with friends whenever we're at Desert Ridge. I love the quality of the food, and their Cobb Salad is amazing, though a massive portion size (not complaining). 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"I love going to Desert Ridge!    CPK is one of my favorite places to stop and have lunch/dinner after a day of browsing around or after a movie at AMC.  There are plenty of delicious gourmet pizza's to choose from, but I usually stick with one of the entree meals instead.  I LOVE the cedar plank salmon with the corn/spinach/cheese side dish.  It's light and wonderful and the salmon is ALWAYS perfectly cooked.    The service is very friendly and they have a nice outdoor dining space, too."}
{"text":"You know, the older I get, the less and less I'm inclined to eat at chains. Even if they're pretty rock solid. Why you ask? Because I suppose it's bc mentally I know that if I fly to any other major, metro city, the same chain will be there and that's not fun to me. Sorta like eating vanilla ice cream every damn day.  But, CPK does do it up just right. Salads are phenom here and service is pretty impeccable. Always, always a fan of patio seating as well. Clean and good quality go along way to me.  Ok CPK, you're a chain - I ain't mad atcha I guess. XOXO!"}
{"text":"I ordered a very yummy salad and even with the restaurant being super busy at lunch, we didn't have to wait long at all."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good our server is good but wish the menu had more options. It's CPK I guess"}
{"text":"The server was so terrible I can hardly remember the food experience.  She failed to return to give us water, or check on us at all.  Failed to clean our table as we finished appetizers and our main course.  The brownie dessert was a major fail, the brownie was too hard.  My daughter had the apple crisp and the apples were all clumped together.  We'd never go back again.  The pizza was 'meh\" for $13.50 each."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and got offered a free appetizer and got to choose what it was. It was buffalo cauliflower. It was so delicious that I'm definitely bringing more people here to try it out because it's so addicting and delicious that I would order as a meal. don't miss out if you come here to eat."}
{"text":"I'm just finishing my meal here on my 26th birthday and am leaving feeling less than impressed. Although I know that random influxes in customers happen, today my experience has been ... bad! We arrived here (its Wednesday) at about 1:30pm. We were greeted in a rush format by both the host and our waiter. He was the only waiter in the restaurant for the first hour of my experience. We did immediately have the opportunity to order drinks and an appetizer. However, we were awkwardly asked for ID at the end of ordering both drinks and our appetizer. Our white corn guacamole was about a half cup worth although it tasted good. We were repeatedly passed by our waiter and did not order our pizza (main dish) until 2:45!!! AND that was not until one of our party members got up and walked to the kitchen to ask for the manager to take our order. Once our food arrived, it tasted good. To make matters worse, the manager, not our waiter, brought our bill (which we immediately asked for because we wanted to get the heck out of there) and before we could put our card in, the original waiter then cares to see if we paid and had no idea how the bill even got there. We were not comped for anything and decided the only thing we could do was tip 10% and leave this review."}
{"text":"They changed their bread!  It's sourdough and as good as that can be, it seemed like they were being skimpy on the amount served.   Server was good but seemed a bit too overambitious in her wanting to serve us.  Got a bit annoying.  Otherwise, standard CPK."}
{"text":"Was in the area and stopped by for a quick lunch.  I hadn't been to a CPK in quite awhile.  Well, I remembered why. Our service was excellent so no complaints there.  But the food is not very good.  I got a lunch pizza/salad combo.  It was only $11.99 but it should have been less.  The pizza was very small and the salad was tiny.  I was very unimpressed! Things to note:  Their 'famous' BBQ chicken pizza tastes Exactly like the one you can buy in the frozen section at most grocery stores.  I'll save my money and just purchase it there if I get a craving. The pizza tasted VERY pre-made, the chicken even reminded me of that already cooked chicken you can buy with the lunch meat at the store.  Thankfully it was doused in BBQ sauce to mask the flavor. The Caesar salad I had issue with as well. My number one pet peeve with a Caesar salad is when they do not dress the salad, but rather serve it on the side.  That is not the way a Caesar is to be served.  Let alone the fact that they give you maybe a tbsp of dressing...not nearly enough.  I ate almost half the salad dry without dressing.  So essentially I just way overpaid for dry lettuce. I was not pleased. I walked away feeling like I spent way too much money for a very mediocre lunch.  I'm not going to come back."}
{"text":"Always love the food. Limited options for vegetarians if you happen to go there quite frequently. :)"}
{"text":"My son and I visited CPK Desert Ridge on May 12th after a movie at the AMC. I recall eating at a CPK at The Mirage in Las Vegas over 18 years ago and I remember it being good and kinda the latest trend. We were promptly greeted and seated. The host was great. HOWEVER, It was at least 15 mins. before any waiters acknowledged us. When one did, she wasn't our waiter but said she would give our drink order to our waiter. Probably 2 mins later our waiter came with our drinks FINALLY. We placed our order immediately in hopes of eating sometime in this decade. Since it had been so long since I'd eaten at a CPK, I asked the waiter if one pizza was enough for 2 people and he said no. So we ordered two, one kinda traditional pizza with pep, sausage etc and one chicken tostada pizza. I'd guess 10 mins passed by the time our food came, with which we were pleased. When I saw how big they were, I was kinda surprised. We would have been more than full on one pizza. But I can't fault the waiter for that. He had no way of knowing if we are big eaters or not. We dug in. I first had a slice of the chicken tostada. My son, the meat pizza. Mine was \"okay\" not a whole lot of flavor even with the salsa. My son's however was really yummy. I ended up having a slice of his since he was raving about it. He then had a slice of mine and he said the same thing, kinda boring and no taste. We ended up leaving with 2 half pizzas. I'm sure I would have given them a better score had it not been for the slowness of the waiter checking on us. Would I go back, yes, but I'd ask to be seated in the large dining room, not off to the side where we were seated, I'm sure that is why we were ignored for so long."}
{"text":"When half a restaurant's menu is available in the freezer section of the grocery store in the same shopping center (and tastes exactly the same), one probably should go for the cheaper option. CPK isn't bad, it's just not worth its exorbitant price. And God forbid you want something extra. There's an up charge for everything. $2.75 for a couple chunks of avocado in my salad.  I know a restaurant has overhead costs, but how about I grab a whole one from said grocery store for less?  As for the pizza; the quality is just okay and thanks to the millions of imitators that have improved on the concept of nontraditional toppings, the chain is not as unique as it seemed 20 years ago. Every place in the US now has a signature BBQ Chicken Pizza.  So why does CPK get three stars? I'll give the chain credit for its easy online ordering, curbside pickup, and friendly staff. But, you can certainly find better within a couple miles of Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"I agree with Shannon on this one nothing tastes bad, but it doesn't taste amazing either. I do think they were one of the pizzerias that started putting crazy things on their pizza though. They have some very interesting toppings!   One time I was here with some friends, but I didn't want pizza. I don't feel like their menu if very accommodating towards that crowd. I got a wrap which I didn't like."}
{"text":"To the credit of the store's Manager, we were given a full refund for the subpar salad (after I had phoned & left a message for her about my experience). Still, based on CPK's ever-shrinking portions (and ever increasing pricing), I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Food is usually on par, but service is not very good. Expect to wait a while for anything and never to get checked on.   I am glad that they've added some healthier options, the Quinoa & Arugula salad is delicious!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for lunch today and everything was absolutely great! Instantly we were greeted upon entering and then seated promptly. Our server, Jake, was absolutely delightful. He was very helpful in allowing me to sample their new iced tea before I ordered it. When I wasn't a fan, he brought me a Coke and then made sure the rest of our order was up to par. While we were waiting for our food, Jake came back and said that bread had just coke out of the oven and asked if we would like some. He was very attentive and took care of us well. He made a boring experience of ordering pizza fun! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Got the creamy pesto penne pasta i added some shrimp,  absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Really yummy food. Portions are on the smaller side but very good quality. Ordered the buffalo cauliflower appetizer and it was incredible. The shrimp scampi over zuccini noodles was good and so was the butter cake. Service was prompt and friendly! A good option in the desert ridge area!"}
{"text":"I use this restaurant for catering and I must say it was a huge disappointment yesterday-! I gave them 24 hour notice ordered five pizzas one salad dessert tray and service for 12 -my daughter went to pick it up at the specific time- I actually called 20 minutes before to confirm- they were not on time but that was OK- when my daughter got it to my home I saw that the dessert tray was not included nor was any of the paper goods that were promised- very frustrating - and I'm fortunately the pizzas don't taste good - love salads and brownies - which we did not get it till later but those darn pizzas just don't taste very good- when I called initially be argued with me that I did not order a dessert tray but then eventually someone said so sorry you can pick it up anytime just very frustrating I don't think I will use them anymore for catering"}
{"text":"My opinion of CPK:  Quinoa & arugula salad was outstanding. The fish tacos are skimpy. One taco had 2 pieces of fish that were roughly the size of fish sticks. The other taco had 2 teeny weeny pieces of fish. I don't like to complain about my food or send it back for fear of having someone spit in it, but the teeny pieces were unacceptable. Our server brought out lots of extra fish at no additional charge.  CPK gets 3 stars for the salad."}
{"text":"Who would win in a fight?  The Desert Ridge CPK or its neighbor across the street Humble Pie (c'mon, I can't be the first to make the comparison)  Probably 15 years ago I used to love the CPK chopped salad.  Anymore it lacks flavor and looks to be skimping on ingredients.  CPK's wine is pretty expensive ($9 for a glass of something I pay $10 for a bottle of at Costco?), and the place doesn't exactly exude local personality (only a recent transplant would have the A/C down to 70 the first week of April).  So when a couple is given a choice to drop $50 at CPK or $40 at Humble Pie..."}
{"text":"Love the staff, always great service, clean and bright but on Saturday I was a little annoyed. Nothing to not make me not want to go again though. Recently my friend and I went and ordered. I wanted to get a sundae but instead gave us the check instead. And also gave us one check instead of separate checks which was a little annoying because they didn't give me a chance to order dessert. Anyways we had two waiters so I was confused on who was our actual waist but it took the 20 minutes to pick up our check and during that time I was trying to get their attention to ask for a sundae and separate checks. Even though it was slow service and a simple mistake I love the restaurant and recommend you go there."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was good. I had a Caesar salad that was great. It had a lot of shaved Parmesan cheese on it. The croutons were homemade. I ordered 4 cheese ravioli with sauteed mushrooms. It was fantastic. The only problem that we had was my son's order got messed up and they brought the wrong thing. They said they would get his order right out to him. Then they brought some macaroni and cheese, but he did not order that either. Then they brought him a pizza (he did order a pizza), but it was not the pizza that he ordered. Finally they brought him his pizza (after the rest of us had already finished our dinners). They did not even offer us a reduced bill because of it."}
{"text":"We requested their private room for a business meeting and training. After we got started they started bringing other customers in to the private room because that is the area for other wait staff to serve. When I approached management they said we didn't agree to a private room. Our meeting and training was trashed.  They made no attempt in honoring our reservation. Rude and disrespectful is gentle. There were several empty tables in the rest of the facility and did not really have to use this room."}
{"text":"Tonight was a Daddy daughter dates with two of favorite people in the world. The plan was to have dinner and see a movie. Due to hectic traffic on a Friday evening  it almost put our plans in jeopardy. I  had already purchased the tickets so if dinner was gonna happen we'd need to expedite it quickly. The girls were in the mood for pizza, so we decided on California Pizza Kitchen at Desert Ridge. because we were in a hurry the counter seemed like a great option. We were not disappointed by this decision in the slightest. We were greeted promptly by the bartender Laura. Laura was sweet and kind giving extra attention to my girls. My youngest daughter has a wheat allergy and Laura took care of her needs supplying a gluten free menu and suggesting appropriate options. We were then greeted by the manager Craig. Craig was very busy helping put together some Togo orders but that did not stop him from personally checking with every guest in the area to ensure that there experience was outstanding in every way possible. Craig also interacted with my girls making there experience a great one. Laura  had the bar and what looked like a couple of tables as well.  She was very attentive , met and exceeded our expectations. Thank you both for helping make this daddy daughter date special. We look forward to visiting again in the near future."}
{"text":"When it comes to CPK, I'm impassive.  The food is good, but it's not great.  The flavors are okay, but just don't stand out.  If you like pizza, I think you should spend your money elsewhere that serves up more authentic New York or Chicago style pizza pies."}
{"text":"Great location ... delicious pizzas and service with a smile.  Nice having \"rewards\" to pay for our key lime pie dessert."}
{"text":"Had a gift card and a hankerin' for a unique salad, this was the place!  Chose the carmelized peach salad, ordered online and drove the 5 miles to pick it up and head home for a relaxing afternoon alone (had a movie all picked out).  Friendly staff, quick service, all bagged up and I zoomed outta there.  Got home, laid out my culinary treasure... salad, dressing, crunchy toppings, bread and butter, plate and utensils... what???  Where are my caramelized peaches?  Huh, that was my whole purpose for going...!!!  Aaargh!  Now, do I head all the way back (salad's getting wilty -- the cold part, hot and the hot part, cold)??  Or... do I call them to let them know (what's that going to really do for the moment...)??  Do I sit and resentfully eat it because I'm hungry and it's here and I can??  So much uncertainty, angst and bitter resentment.    I sat, I ate, I felt disappointed and angry.  (I tipped hella good, too!)  Later I emailed them, politely and in the \"I just wanted you to be aware\" way.  They sent me a coupon for a free salad, that was nice.  Still don't know how caramelized peaches taste..."}
{"text":"My experience was disappointing. I ordered fish tacos, the taco shells we're unedible, fish was cold and bite size. Our wait staff was friendly but he failed twice to bring us bread, refills we're scarce. We shared dessert, we had the strawberry shortcake and had to use a knife to cut biscuit. On top of that, the food us overrated and overpriced. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Kind of busy restaurant, but I constantly see people waiting & servers just talking amongst themselves ...  Bathrooms are extremely disgusting. Smelly, dirty...just gross all around.  We had to ask another server for our server (he just disappeared) & he still took another 10 minutes to come by ask if we wanted dessert (yeah right..) and left the check. Last time we saw him ...horrible, disappointing service    But our food was pretty good ..."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to post reviews but had to after the experience I had today. First, there were a select few employees that had smiles on their faces and fantastic attitudes and customer service. With that being said, the majority of the employees, including our server, were sporting the most miserable attitudes and facial expressions I have ever experienced at a restaurant. I mean if I had that many people working for me that hated their jobs so much, I would let them go. What a horrible representation of such a wonderful restaurant that I will never visit again! We ordered one appetizer with a coupon and one pizza. Just one pizza. Didn't come with chicken, our waiter asked if we wanted to ADD chicken and we said no, no chicken. Pizza came with chicken and waiter didn't deliver our food or bother checking on us. The coupon wasn't applied to our appetizer."}
{"text":"You can't miss going to a CPK.  The food is always exactly as you would expect and consistent.  The service was good.  Lots of seating.  However, first the hostess tried to seat us in this drafty room with little tables for four.  We didn't want to sit there.  It's 50 degrees outside!   I also noticed that they put all the other groups with children at tables in the corners.  This bad first impression was more than made up by our server.  She brought our food quickly when we told her that we missed lunch. We may go there again during this vacation..."}
{"text":"The pizza is very disgusting A  rude people working  I do not recommend this  place The pizza is not fresh  You're asking them to make a the fresh pizza they said no no how can you say no to a paying customer"}
{"text":"We get this place catered at our office like once a quarter and everyone looks forward to it.  The various types of food available make it perfect to get an office catered so I recommend it for anyone thinking about it.   Their salads and pasta are awesome noatter what kind you get.   1 thing I dont like is how small the pizzas are... You have to order like 30 to feed an entire office which is pretty disappointing.   All in all- a great spot for a quality inexpensive meal"}
{"text":"I just had another terrible experience at this CPK.  The server didn't even take our drink order for 20 min.  He had his back to us helping an elderly couple. Although there were no other customers,  no one else could be bothered to help us.  He then went back to that older couple for another 20 min while our food got cold.  I even gave him one last chance by telling him that we were unhappy.  He sulked off and never returned.    Food was good I think.  It was hard for me to tell through the bitter taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"After being wow'ed by the delectable shortrib chipotle mac-n-cheese served at the neighboring Elite event, I decided to show some love to CPK by ordering a full plate of that incredible entree, and not just show up for a complementary drink.  However, the entree I paid for paled in comparison to the delightful fare I had sampled a mere hour beforehand.  The shortrib was tougher, and didnt fall apart and melt in my mouth like the free taste did.  The chipotle taste was spot on, but the beef was a letdown.  So, I left with the hard learned lesson that perfection is hard to replicate"}
{"text":"Food has always been at least 4 stars here but the service just hasn't caught up to the same level.   Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad experience by any means. It just always seems like the servers have too many tables or something.. but there are plenty on the floor. Slow to take our order, slow to bring the check and absolutely no refills or checking on how our food was. The few interactions we did have with our server were friendly though.   Again, the food is always good so I don't really need to be checked on but a refill or two of water at least wouldn't hurt. On this visit I tried the carne asada pizza and was pleasantly surprised. On par with my other favorites (bbq chicken, California club, Hawaiian, etc). As long as you don't mind a little wait or having to flag someone down to refill your drinks, this is a tasty chain   Update: another visit several months later and service was much much better! Our waitress was so nice, super attentive, quick with refills and the check. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service and always fast. Not super busy for the times I've been here and always quiet which is good. I've tried a bunch of their pizzas and they're always amazing! Their salads are good too. Wish they had a bigger desert choice though. The Chipotle Chicken Pizza is a little too spicy but it was very good. I'd definitely go here again and recommend it to people in town for a visit since it has very simple but a expansive choice of foods."}
{"text":"This CPK smells horrible.  I held my breath the whole lunch. It smells like dirty old carpet or dirty wet rags.  HORRIBLE.  do not dine here until they renovate"}
{"text":"WTH? Yelp suggests open until 10. Door locked at 915. I wonder if this type of thing is pervasive. Might have something to do with CPK getting harder and harder to find."}
{"text":"One thing about CPK is that they are consistent. I can say that I will be pleased with my meal no matter which location I go to. My favorites: Thai Chicken Pizza, Salmon, Thai crunch or miso salad. Yum."}
{"text":"Awesome service and awesome pizza!!!!i love eating pizza in CPK because it's always fresh and yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"This C.P.K. is in a strange location.  Even though it's in Desert Ridge it's sort of tucked away and hidden.  The dining room and bar area is pretty tiny.  Other than that the food, service, prices, etc are like any other C.P.K."}
{"text":"So yesterday I went to the movies with my mom and my sister in law  and after we decided to come here to have linner because my mom had some gift cards. I have been here before and it has always been pretty good, I usually get a half caesar salad and a cup of tortilla soup but have also tried the spring rolls, the caeser sandwich, pastas, and some pizzas. It has all been pretty good. But anyway, back to yesterday... First off, when you come here you have to request bread and the bread they give you is just kind of plain mediocre bread, nothing exciting. Then it is time to order and I decided to try something different and ordered the chicken tequila fettuccini. My mom got the fusilli pasta with veggies (her usual) and the sis got a shrimp salad of sorts. Everything was good, but, in my opinion, it was overpriced. My dish had a lot of flavor and I enjoyed it, but it cost around 13$. I would have no problem with this price at an independent restaurant, but I think this is too much for a chain. Everyone else seemed to like their food too. Also, the service was decent, our waitress was timely and friendly. So this is a good chain to go to when you just saw a movie or are shopping at dessert ridge, but it is still a chain and isn't anything mind blowing."}
{"text":"This CPK is located in the desert ridge marketplace. Chose this spot for quick lunch before catching a movie. Ordered a Hawaiian pizza and my date ordered mac &cheese. Both were mediocre at best. However, service was excellent."}
{"text":"Service has always been good, but I always sit at the bar.  Food is always just right, reasonably priced, etc.  Parking isn't so great because of restaurant location though.  Wish they had better beer selection.  Menu changes every so often with a few innovative ideas worth trying.  Good chain."}
{"text":"I called the California Pizza Kitchen asked manager what location in desert ridge he was very nice telling me where in desert ridge and the service was good and the food was good but when I was ask the waitress if I can use visit gift card $25.00 didn't know he didn't even asked his manager"}
{"text":"The staff here is great!  Very helpful and patient with their recommendations, and willing to do anything to make sure you have a good experience.  The pizza of course, is solid, and the atmosphere is good.  I will keep on coming back to this location, which is conveniently located at Desert Ridge."}
