{"text":"I lived across from the restaurant and decided to check it out. To my surprise, it was fantastic. Their menu is simple which includes three different types of ramen broth and four type of starters. The ramen is tasty and surprisingly light. They do not use MSG in their broth which is important to me. I've tried many different ramen restaurants in Montreal, and they were not comparable to this place. To sum up, this restaurant got three important points: great authentic ramen, reasonable price ($12-13), and good service. I will definitely go back to satisfy my ramen cravings."}
{"text":"This is the lowest ratings I've given for restaurants. I'm only judging in terms for vegetarian food. Got the wonton fuwari, had two bites of the noodles in the soup. The noodle texture was fine but the soup flavour just taste like msg and I don't mean to be disrespectful but I definitely feel like I could've cooked a better bowl of noodles myself. As for the wontons, they are very bland. The mixing in it felt like it was just vegetables and tofu dumped into a blender, which became tasteless baby food. All in all I finished the 4 wontons and just left a full bowl of noodles. Since the bill came out to be around 80$........Would not come back again. Also the marinated egg is nothing like what you would expect at other ramen stores. It is literally a hard boiled egg with some salt. I regret trying it. Sorry for being so close minded!! But I really couldn't accept this meal. My bad!!! I'm being selfish and biased here aren't I."}
{"text":"Very cutely decorated place. Finally got to try toripaitan ramen. I tried the toripaitan nouveau classique, and someone I was with tried a vegetarian broth. Chicken broth was unexpectedly thick, but the taste was sealed nicely so you don't get sick of it. Vegetarian broth was apparently very good and light, since she doesn't like thick soups. Halfway, I realised that the combo they offered was really worth it so we ordered chirashi sushi and their homemade matcha ice cream. I didn't try the chirashi sushi but it seemed good. Their matcha ice cream though. I could feel the matcha and I really liked it. Overall, very good experience. Would come again."}
{"text":"Nakamichi Ramen is what Montreal has been waiting for!!! High Asian comfort food at last.  To taste anything similar one has to go to Vancouver's Marutama. But Nakamichi's broth even has Marutama beat in my opinion -- lighter and more subtle.  Simply put, the chicken broth is out of this world: rich and gentle as superlative chicken broth should be. Some of the best I've ever tasted, Japanese offerings included.  The first choice of ramen is pretty classic. The pork and egg are nonetheless masterfully rendered.   The second and third choices are rather unorthodox yet still pretty refined. Number 2 features  chopped raw white onions and red peppers which would be totally unacceptable if the broth and chicken morsels weren't so delectable. Not bad at all.  The third choice involves a subtle truffle broth and green salad topping. A little strange but not unpleasant.   The best part about Nakamichi is that it finally gives Montrealers a fine example of how good ramen can and should be. Hopefully its arrival will mark the beginning of a new era of competitive A level offerings.  Let the competition begin!"}
{"text":"Omgomgomg Finally get to try it haha We ordered the number 1 and 2.  Number 1: TORI PAITAN RAMEN DAYUM Flavourful omg (thick strong broth) Tender meat  (must try haha) The Egg yolk was perfect ~ FYI: \"Tori paitan is a rich, thick and cloudy broth, tonkotsu-like but made by long, slow simmering of chicken bones and chicken parts instead of pork bones.\"  Number 2: I was told that it was a ramen designed to meet Montreal's consumer.  Guess I am not Québécois enough ahaha. It was a tasty broth, more sour than the other one. Intead of Cha siu meat it came with SUPER TENDER CHICKEN. (Never had a chicken that tender before.) (thumbs up haha) I also discovered KOMBUCHA (Fermented tea; the real Japanese one use kelp) my god haha  Tasty, not too salty drink. It has health benefits   Ramen Flavourful broth as fck  I will definitely come back to try the ice cream and SOBA"}
{"text":"I came here really excited to try a new Ramen place, I was never a fan of rame until I had the ramen at Misoya. I choose the Combo Option that comes with a mini Donburi and dessert  First the staff and ambiance is great. The decoration down to the utensils are great.  I eat a lot of vegetarian ( and some seafood as well ) so I had the Truffle Soba Kiwami. The broth is vegetarian and they replace the meat topping with avocado. The bowl came with a mixed green salad , onions, red pepper, avocado and an egg on top. I had the mentaiko and takana (raw marinated salmon)  donburi.   Im sad to say I did not enjoy one thing I had, even the green tea ice cream wasn't good. My broth was not good at all - to the point where I couldn't finish my food (I had paid extra to have a large portion) and its very rare I would throw away my food.  The donburi I had was not good either, but the rice was not bad (me and a friend both had the donburi and ice cream and we both didn't enjoy them).  I didnt like the toppings on my ramen , they didnt quite make sense to me but to be fair my friends who had the non vegetarian options enjoyed their meal , one in particular saying her ramen was very authentic and she enjoyed every bite (she had the Daku)."}
{"text":"Hidden gem alert! This unassuming ramen bistro will shatter your taste buds. Don't expect the regular ramen noddles here. Love the vegan ramen with truffle oil but my most favourite is the guguru (hopefully that's the right name, if not look for something that starts with a G.)  This ramen has handmade whole wheat noodles with arugula, dried tomatoes, avocado and mushrooms. There is no broth but add a little bit of spicy miso and everything will be alright!   Things to improve: the menu is very complicated and they need to simplify it, maybe a description and photos would help?!  The service is ok but a little too student like.  That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"If I had to nitpick I'd say the daku broth is a little too salty and the regular bowl could use a little more noodles.   But overall, their dishes feature a great deal of flavour and texture balance. Top notch service and neat minimalistic design"}
{"text":"If you have never tried ramen before, it's better to bring a friend who knows French or Japanese. Because there is no English menu. The noodles there taste good. It's worth trying. Weekday afternoons are perfect time. Saturday night there are a lot of people, you might have to wait for a little while."}
{"text":"La propreté douteuse, la préparation calcinée"}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is super comfy and chill, they've got really nice, sincere, and attentive people working there. Jazz music accompanies your lunch and they have all sorts of Ramen related books artfully scattered around the place. So if you're dining alone and want to read something more interesting than your work emails or your friends' facebook shares you've got something to fall back on. Me, I'm at Page 37 on the Ramen book, with nary a spot of soup on its pages. (yet)  I've ordered pretty much everything from the top of the menu down to the desert list and can attest to the deliciousness of all the menu items.  The broth: OMG the broth. Not only do they offer both pork and or chicken but they ALSO have a vegetable broth that is just as satisfying to an omnivore such as myself as a meat based broth. All broths were expertly seasoned and were silky delicious and served with perfectly prepared toppings; the egg, the veg, the chaisu pork; everything. Just everything.  But yesterday! Yesterday I was blown away by a new dish that hit the menu. A soup that is not a soup! I was suspicious at first, but because I had never been disappointed with my menu selections I threw caution to the wind and ordered the Gururi Nakamichi.  Imagine this: A vegetarian broth fills the bottom third of your bowl. The next third you have thick udon noodles and atop this, you get a heaping mound of chopped red peppers, arugula, avocado, (or chicken if you want a non-veg option), seaweed, and of course the half-egg.  I was instructed that to properly enjoy this colourful and elegant dish I should mix it all up so that the broth interacted will all the other ingredients. So I did that, and dug right in. (Side note: they use proper chopsticks here, not those horrible splinter sticks that are ubiquitous elsewhere. It's a pleasure to eat with them, knowing that you won't end up with lumber in you lips.)  The pepperiness of the arugula bit into and played against the Umami flavours of the rest of the meal - Umami so satisfying that you'll want to tell Umama all about it. The udon noodles were thick and chewy adding to the heartiness of the meal. I never wanted this meal to end, it was so good.  Actually, I'm going back again today so if you see some guy hunched protectively over his bowl with sticks in one hand and a book in the other; that's me. Please forgive the little moans of bliss that might escape from time to time.  Oh, and all this for $12.75."}
{"text":"Tres bon ramen pour des prix plus que correct (11-14$ / ramen). Rien a reproché au service.  On y retournera"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of good things about it but I'm a little disappointed.... We were a group of four and we ordered the together. However, one friend of mine and I ordered the nouveau classique and waited for more than half an hour. The other two friends had finished theirs long ago. AND they forgot to give us the extra toppings we ordered... I was very disappointed. In terms of the ramen, I think it's just okay... The broth was a little salty and too thick/oily to me. Well, I don't know what to say. I might try other ramen next time to see if my experience today was a singular case."}
{"text":"My fav ramen joint in Montreal recently took a nosedive quality-wise, so I've been eager to branch out and find a replacement. I think that this place could be it. Really interesting flavour combos, tasty and varied broths and ingredients, friendly service---what more do you need?   The broth is not as thick and cloying here as it is at Yokato Yokabai, so the soup is a lot lighter while still managing to be hearty and filling.   My only feedback is that the menu is a tad confusing to navigate (it features a chart), but I fully intend to familiarize myself with it on return trips. The rice bowls also look awesome, and they have many vegan food options if that is your jam. The space is light and airy, with a large shared table in the center of the room. I'll definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"So the restaurant has a pleasant ambiance, and you get a view of the kitchen and the chef doing their thing which is pretty cool. The service is good, although when we ordered, we forgot to mention what size we wanted and so the waitress assumed we wanted the large (which we didn't, so that was a bummer). I was looking for the vegan option on the menu and saw the Truffle-Soba that had the veggie broth and asked for it without the egg. I also asked and ramen doesn't contain egg!   When our food came out, I was a little shocked to find ham in my ramen; all I had to do was tell her I meant to order the vegan option and she took it back to the kitchen and swapped it with no issue. So if you want the vegan option, you need to ask for it; no biggie, I'm glad they even have a vegan option.  They brought me back the bowl and I suspect they took the meat off and just replaced it with avocado.  Honestly, my ramen bowl didn't look very appetizing. It seemed to me as though they kind of cheap out on toppings. As for the taste- just okay. Nothing special really, the veggie broth was pretty salty, not that it's necessarily a bad thing.  All in all, if you really want to try vegan ramen, this place could be a good pick. I was pretty impressed as I've never seen a place that serves vegan ramen noodles. Pretty cool! I think the ramen would be so much with better toppings!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with wonderful decoration and attentive service. The restaurant is very cute and tidy plus a chill and refreshing atmosphere, which gives a nice ambiance to enjoy the food. The ramen that I tried, nouveau classique, was delicious and definitely an avant garde. For me, untraditional ramen is sometimes a hit-or-miss, but this restaurant really delivered it and I really loved their noodles.   The broth was thick and creamy with tender ramen noodles plus a generous topping of egg, meat slices, and vegetables. I really love the new experimental toppings, especially the balled minced meat, greatly seasoned and well accompanied with the ramen. In sums, it is a great ramen restaurant and my friends and I will definitely return to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"The server we had seemed like he had no clue  how to serve Japanese food... Brings out appetizers without small plates to use... Brings ramen without the renge spoon...   Ramen noodle was overcooked and the soup was unusually thick and tasted like they used the water to cook the noodle for the soup..  Nihonjin should avoid..."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. Cozy and warm. Great service. Good ramen, very tasty and full of flavor. One of the best in Montreal definitely. I had the miso based ramen, and though I considere it was too heavy for me, the balance of flavors and textures was to the point.  On the contrary, the matcha homemade ice cream was not good. Too creamy and with an artificial matcha taste. Gave the impression it was nos fresh."}
{"text":"Two of my friends rave about this place. After going twice, I'm not sure what the craziness is all about. They do good noodles fair enough. But both times I found the meals to be too oily and hence too heavy - trust me, I like gravies and sauces! But we're talking about oily meals here! Their service is good, they seem to be quite popular (lunch room was packed!). But I wasn't a fan of the two veggie options I tried."}
{"text":"My review is more a 3.5, but I'm bumping it up because 1) I'm not an \"expert\" on authentic ramen, I just know what my taste buds enjoy! and 2) since all the other reviews so far are giving it a 5, and some of them seem pretty knowledgeable on all things ramen, I'm going to give this place the benefit of doubt. With that said, while I think it's great that there is a solid ramen place now in Montreal where all non-pork eaters and vegetarians can eat elbow to elbow with us pork loving folk, I really prefer tonkotsu, pork broth, versus the chicken broth found here. It's actually not about texture, since the broth I had (ordered #1 with chashu) was rich and thick, but more about the taste. The taste didn't have the same depth to me as a pork broth and wasn't as silky and buttery. Also, the chashu didn't have a lot of flavor, tasted boiled without much seasoning, and was tough. I much prefer a fattier piece that isn't a struggle to chew on. We also ordered an appetizer of \"sara wontons\". Good, but not great, and won't order them again.  The good news? Noodles were good, and the broth did grow on me after a few spoonfuls. I also didn't feel as heavy at the end of the meal as I usually do having pork broth (I'm not talking about MSG here). The egg yolk was also the best out of any ramen places I've tried. Service was also very attentive and nice. I will be back, since this is really the only solid option I know where I can bring my veggie and chicken lover peeps and have them actually receive a good broth (unlike Yokato Yokobai for example)."}
{"text":"I think it's no longer the same owner as before..."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a Japanese colleague (a self-described \"ramen-freak\"). I think he was looking around for a good ramen place in Montreal, so the fact that he gave me Nakamichi's business card was a good sign.  We went there last night. The dinning room was small and too warm, but modern and well lighted. They made the most of the space by minimizing the number of tables, and adding seats at the \"bar\". A large window at the back was transformed into a coat rack. We browsed the menu, which offered four different ramens, in addition to side-dishes, extra toppings, desserts, and Japanese tea. Unfortunately, the Tokyo Mode Sho-yu ramen ran out, so we ordered the Tori-paitan \"Nouveau Classique\" and the Truffle Soba \"Kiwami\", along with the Chirashi-sushi and Mentaiko-Takana donburis. Nakamichi's menu is still evolving and teas were recently introduced, so we tried the Hoji-cha.   The tea came first. Its flavor was comforting, similar to buckwheat tea, but the portion was a bit small - I wonder if they could refill it? Then came the dons. The presentation was beautiful, the rice perfectly cooked, and the toppings generous - so much, in fact, that it was a bit too salty in the end. Soon after we finished came the ramen. The Tori-paitan's noodles were perfectly soaked in the thick and creamy broth, and the chicken breast and meatball were tender. The Truffle Soba had baby salad greens in it, something I found surprisingly good. The broth was clear and more straightforward, but still enhanced the flavor of the soba and (extra tender) pork slices. The homemade matcha ice-cream came with the tiniest spoon, and was rather solid. I tried digging into it, but instead broke it into chunks. Despite the strange consistency, the taste was impeccable. It was refreshing, super smooth, not too sweet, and most importantly, its matcha content is higher than that of any other commercial brand. They should sell it as buckets - I would buy liters of it.   We were more than happy about the meal. Prices were very competitive, the speed and quality of the service was beyond reproach, and the food was delicious. Will definitely go back!  Note 1: They seem to looooove Ikea; most of their tableware was from the 365+ collection (water glasses, tea glasses, cork-lidded jug, tea makers, bowls, etc.). Speaking of tableware, they had the cuttest forks, specially designed to eat noodles (see photos). Even the chopsticks were textured to facilitate noodle-eating!  Note 2: Nice music."}
{"text":"I've tried many ramen restaurants in Montreal, but Nakamichi has proven itself to be the new standard. The service great, and the staff is very kind and accommodating. The portions are a decent size, and their broth isn't overly salty unlike other restaurants. There is also the option of getting it half salted. The egg was very fresh, the noodles tasted fresh too, and the environment creates a very \"modern authentic Japanese\" feel. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is not the usual authentic japanese ramen that you would imagine. Even their ustensils are special lol (for real tho). I ordered: - Truffle soba: It is the first time I have seen so many veggies in a noodle dish. Usually I really care about having a good portion of greens in my meal, but I'm not quite sure how to feel about this dish though. The veggies didn't seem to go well with the broth, especially that the salad was soaked in the broth... The chashu looked different from what I usually have, but it tasted great. The broth itself was a little too salty in my opinion. The portion is fairly small compared to other ramen places I hace been to. Probably won't reorder this. - Salmon chirashi: Quite good. The pickles in the rice make the salmon taste less \"fishy\". For only 5.5$ it is a quite nice appetizer.   One major down side of this place is that the food comes really slowly...almost waited a whole hour. Even though I was not amazed by my experience here, I'll probably come back to give a try to another of their ramen dish. Just to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"As someone who knows Japan extensively, this is as authentic as it gets from the food to the service to the ambiance. Very adorable little spot with great Ramen...Kazu finally has some real competition!  Will be on my top Ramen list in MTL. Do yourselves a favour and try this place out!"}
{"text":"I had the vegan ramen. I don't expect vegan or vegetarian ramen to be quite as savory so I generally hold them to a lesser standard. Even with that, this was by far the worst ramen I've ever had. The broth tasted of nothing but onion. The toppings included diced onion and red pepper and avocado. None of which are toppings I would normally associate with ramen. If this had been served in a different style bowl, there would be nothing to make me feel as though I was even eating ramen. Just terrible."}
{"text":"There was almost no soup in the ramen and way too much green onions... and the waiting was more than a hour after we ordered."}
{"text":"Fusion. But amazing!!! People say their broth is salty I disagree. So much better than kinton ramen and such."}
{"text":"Yay this place was so delicious today I felt all the thrill of a Yelp food adventure satisfied even though they were out of ramen noodles at noon on a Tuesday! It's tiny and chic with ramen-nerd books on the tables and beautiful posters. The menu gave us some anxiety at first, there were a lot of options with a number of them only in Japanese, but the staff were kind and helpful and the fact that we were down to 2 main dishes to chose from helped.  I had a vegan noodle dish with incredibly rich broth, thick chewy whole wheat noodles, and lovely bitter greens, boiled egg and avocado. I've never had anything quite like it, it was amazing and I can't wait to finish the leftovers. My friend loved his dish as well, amazing pork broth with this excellent tang in it from grated yuzu. We're both looking forward to going back, if you're in the area check it out."}
{"text":"Really don't understand the hype about this restaurant. Four of us went there and I got the combo with #1 pork soup and the seafood don.   The don was boring, and the rice was tough and dry.  After AN HOUR, finally, the ramen came. I don't understand why they needed an whole hour to make a bowl of ramen which was literally just cooking the noodles and adding the soup.  Surprisingly, the chicken based soup was really thick and SALTY. The noodles were hard to chew, AGAIN. Also, I felt really thirsty after I got home, it could means the ramen was wayyyy to salty or there was lots of MSG in the ramen or both.   The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was because the waiter was really nice, tried to apologize for the long wait even it wasn't his fault.   But for $20 before tax, I expected quality ramen with quick service, so, this place was a great disappointment."}
{"text":"A cosy spot right by the museum of fine arts. We ordered their vegan dumplings and their veggie ramen with avocado. The broth was fish broth and they substitute meat for avocado. Definitely a different flavour of ramen than I am used to. The soup was thicker and creamier, and the noodles were thin and a bit dry. Overall a place to try our a different style of ramen, but if you're into the regular ramen, maybe not for you!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new Ramen place and using Yelp we found this one. The restaurant is minimalist, clean, with a zen ambiance. The cutlery was beautiful and fun to use. I took the Dako and it was delicious! The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is that they don't have the alcohol licence yet. This delicious meal would have been perfect with a beer. I would definitively go again."}
{"text":"So far this is the best ramen that I've had in Montreal. Broth is delicious but not too salty, without the use of MSG. The Donburis are also very well balanced. Ice cream was ok, I've had better at other places that specialize in making ice cream. But I don't care about the ice cream, I care about the five star ramen."}
{"text":"J'ai atterri ici grâce à un article lu sur mtl blog. Je n'avais jamais goûté de vrai ramen japonais et je pense que ce n'est pas pour moi. Le service était parfais, les serveurs serviable et à disposition pour toute question. Après c'est une histoire de goût je pense. J'ai trouvé cela trop fade, la viande trop salé. Le mariage des saveurs ne convient pas à mes papilles. Je pense que j'y retournerais néanmoins pour essayer autre chose car l'ambiance était vraiment chouette."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not what it used to be. They changed the whole concept and not for better. The toppings don't really make sense anymore, everything is so salty, and the service is overly casual, if you know what I mean.  Plus, I went there with my vegetarian friend who got the vegetarian ramen, which happened to come with meat? After asking the server what the hell, he told us \"when ordering the vegetarian meal you have to specify us you want it vegetarian,otherwise it comes with meat\". What the actual hell? Very disappointing. I don't know if they changed owners or something but it's gotten really bad, whereas it used to be the most delicious ramen in Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening, and surprisingly didn't have to wait to get seated. Although, it took a few mins to order because there was one waiter.   The spicy \"la la la\" ramen was very good, the spice gave it a kick of flavor and the broth was a little thicker than others. We also got the fried chicken appetizer and for dessert, a scoop of matcha ice cream which were both good but nothing special.  All in all, it's a comfy cute spot with above average ramen. Would definetly come back again!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations after reading the reviews on Yelp!  The place is nicely decorated with high counter tables and huge wooden table in the center.   Menu is simple or figure couldn't go wrong with the combo no.2. First,  the portion I'd quite small for the price...it would have been ok if the taste was there. However, I found the soup to be too thick and too salty to my liking. I  normally never drunk tap water in a restaurant, but the soup was so salty that i had to.take a few sips of the water. I had originally ordered the Daku and my friend ordered the New Classique. After tasking each other's soup, we had swapped our ramen.  I also found that they were quite cheap for the meat portion...2 tiny slices of pork (Daku )3 even tinier slices of chicken (new classique).  However, I must say that their noodles is better than most ramen places in Montreal.  Services is pretty friendly but this is definitely not enough to make me come back."}
{"text":"My mother and I came in here for a quick lunch just a few hours ago. We can't stop thinking about how good it was! We're Japanese, so we have pretty high standards for any Japanese food... But there were no complaints from mom, and she finished her ramen to the last drop. This beats any ramen I've had in Toronto. I highly recommend the Murasaki. Fish broth ramen is hard to come by in Canada, but they do an excellent job!   I'm almost considering going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I found my favourite ramen place in Montreal.  This tuck-away ramen restaurant is a hidden gem of Montreal. While it is not that it, the limited seating creates the perfect atmosphere for small parties to enjoy a casual meal.  Their ramen is very flavourful and authentic. I enjoyed the broth very much and the noodles were perfect. I highly recommend the home made green tea ice cream as well!"}
{"text":"The interior of this place is absolutely beautiful but its ramen is disappointing in contrast. I came here with my boyfriend and his mother a few weeks ago. I ordered the tori paitan nouveau classique which was definitely... nouveau. I can't say much for the untraditional toppings because its to be expected with the name, but the broth was so salty. My boyfriend is vegan so he got a vegan ramen. I tried his broth which was also salty and tasted like they dumped an entire thing of onion and garlic powder inside. His mother's salad was good, lol.  Now, I've had ramen in NYC, Philly, and Toronto. I even worked at a ramen place. My boyfriend visited Japan when he wasn't vegan and had ramen there. But still, neither of us has high standards for ramen found outside Japan because it's understandable. And I'm trying to take their attempt at revamping ramen into consideration but... the ramen here was just bad. The wait was long and not worth it."}
{"text":"Having been to Japan many times, I can say the ramen here is probably the most authentic in Montreal. Although still incomparable with the ramen in Tokyo, this restaurant deserves a good rating.  The soup is rich in flavor, the pork slices are soft and the egg was made just right. The noodles were tender and great, however the amount/portion was displeasing considering its price (12-14$). Overall, a bowl of hot ramen here is a splendid choice for a cold winter. Yet, it simply isn't filling for most people, including me and my friend.   The restaurant itself is decorated delicately with western style. The design of the interior of this small restaurant is very modern and aesthetically pleasing. Along with the quiet environment, this small restaurant can be a great choice for small gatherings and dates."}
{"text":"Nice decorations and ambiance. Ramen doesn't look fancy but tastes good. Noodle is thin but tender and chewy, soup is creamy silky and thick. But there weren't many toppings but only half an egg, green onions, sea weed, and two pieces of pork( very tender and not greasy at all ), and the soup is kinda too salty at the end."}
{"text":"I'm a huge noodle person but this place honestly disappointed me  The service and decor were both great, it's a great ambience and a nice place to take someone for a date   However, the serving size was a lot smaller than i thought, and it's quite pricy (15$ for a regular after tip and for the amount you get it's not great) the food itself tasted pretty great (i got the daku which is pork with chicken broth), but the soup was really salty  overall i'd give the food a 7.5/10 portions for price a 4/10 service and decor an 8/10  come here if you like ramen and have money to spend"}
{"text":"Je tiens à féliciter Nakamichi pour l'introduction d'un nouveau menu entièrement végétalien (dénommé Vegemichi). C'est le premier du genre à Montréal et il est désormais disponible en tout temps! On ne parle pas ici de quelques items isolés mais bien de 4 entrées, 6 plats principaux (incluant 2 soupes ramen et 2 versions mazemen, donc sans bouillon) et 3 desserts. Évidemment et parce que c'est la spécialité du restaurant, je vous suggère fortement de commander une soupe ramen. Vous avez le choix entre Kiwami et LaLaLa. La première, rafraîchissante et légère, est une variation d'un plat déjà disponible sur le menu régulier (la viande et l'uf ont été remplacés par des plantes comme, entre autres, de l'avocat). La deuxième, épicée, est composée de lait de soya et de tofu frit. Si vous venez à 2, commandez les wonton en guise d'entrée: vous en aurez assez à partager (et ouvrir l'appétit!). Pour le dessert, la crème glacée au chocolat à base de tofu soyeux et de banane est incontournable. Sa texture unique et la complexité de ses saveurs ont de bonnes chances de vous plaire! Même si, lors de ma visite, le personnel ne connaissait pas encore le menu sur le bout des doigts, j'ai apprécié leur gentillesse et la rapidité du service. L'endroit, bien que petit, est charmant et bien éclairé. Je dirais qu'il est à mi-chemin entre traditionnel et moderne. Bref, que vous soyez végétarien, végane ou simplement un omnivore à la recherche de nouveaux horizons, donnez une chance au concept Vegemichi. On peut dire que Nakamichi mérite désormais sa place entre Crudessence et La Panthère Verte!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Bad service (did not give us menus), terrible ramen noodles and broth. Salmon-don was really bad. Match ice cream tasted way too much like match, bad texture. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"Now my undisputed best Ramen shop in town. Have visited 2 times in a 1 week span. The broth is out of this world perfectly seasoned, masterfully emulsified with the fat.   Noodles are cooked just right, garnishes are delicious. Care and live is put into every bite.   Not to mention the service is kind and very professional. I hope this place is here to stay for a long time.   Thank you Nakamichi!"}
{"text":"I tried their Zuzuzu noodles because I usually like thick noodles and I wasn't disappointed! This little restaurant is very close to Concordia, the decor is a bit different from other ramen place, it is quite trendy. The menu has quite a lot of really funkily named choices, it's worth trying!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal.  Best ramen I've had since Hawaii. Totally worth a try.  Great jazz music too..."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend after a study session on a cold winter night. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor so make sure to look up when searching for it. Place is very bright, which gives it a warm/cozy feeling. Waitress was really nice and efficient, she answered all my question about the 3 different ramen they have. Me and my friends went for the combo which consist of a choice of starter (salad or rice with salmon roe I believe), a choice of ramen between the first 2 on the menu, and green tea ice cream for desert.  We went for different starters. The salad looked really nice and she told me she really liked it. My starter was good too, and for a starter I think it was a pretty good portion. Then we had the ramen (we both took the second one on the menu, I dont remember the name). I loved it. The broth was creamy, which was a first for me, but I did not dislike it. I think that the noodles, which were quite thin, really fit the taste of the ramen (1st time I liked eating thin noodles).  The only thing I was disapointed with was the \"spicy paste\". Basically, the ramen comes with a spicy paste on the side, but when I put the paste in the broth, it wasn't spicy at all. Also, my friend did not like how the egg was cooked (not cooked enough for her, the white was still a bit watery? don't really know how to describe it), but I found it perfect. Then, we had the desert. Really nice green tea, I did not ask, but I think that they make it themselves (tasted better than green tea ice cream I buy at the supermarket or the ones I get in most sushi places). Only reasons I do not give it 5 stars is because they only take cash and do not point it out clearly, and because the spicy paste wasn't spicy at all."}
{"text":"Nakamichi is located on Mackey street closer to Sherbrooke. It is a small bistro (20~30 seats) dedicated to Japanese style Ramen dish. The most outstanding characteristic of this place is the customer service. The waiter/waitress always looks after you for water, napkin etc.  I ordered extra spicy Jalapeno Tan-Tan noodle. It seems universally true for all of their ramen that the broth is extremely thick. The dishes are certainly unique and rememberable, however the broth tasted overly thick to me. If you are into thick broth, this place is for you.  Heat level: 6.5/10.0 (good spice)"}
{"text":"Modern Montreal take on ramen.  Nice atmosphere and good flavours.  Prices were normal for meal ramen and I'll be going back to try the other items."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: The bistro has a very simple look to it and it's definitely a calmer restaurant. Everything is very clean as well.  FOOD: The ramen there tastes very good. They have a clean and light broth but still manages to be flavorful. I also had a matcha cake as dessert which was pretty good as well. Although the size that it comes in is pretty small. I will definitely be coming back here though!  PRICE: For the amount that you get, I think it's slightly overpriced but maybe that's just me. Usually vegetarian-inclined places tend to be a little more expensive anyways.  SERVICE: The staff was very friendly. They made sure that everything was to our liking and did what they were supposed to do."}
{"text":"Very friendly and cozy atmosphere. Authentic vibes. Great ramen. I'll be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"I came here after reading the different reviews and can definitely say I agree! Unlike most ramen broths,  the broth here is a chicken based stock which makes for a lighter and more delicate soup. Although I normally prefer a broth with more depth of flavour,  I appreciated the lighter flavour.  The meat is cooked to perfection and is juicy and super soft.    The decor is super cute and the staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"There's little I can compare to as far as taste-wow-factor when I think about that truffle ramen. Right to the last drops of broth, I was under some mystic ramen spell over that rich, earthy and perfectly savoury broth loaded with fresh veggies and (obvs) ramen noodles.   Another thing Schouppe does wonderfully is the vegan menu. That's right, not only are these guys seriously vegan-friendly but they have a whole menu-apart for their vegan clientele. Additional to the amazing truffle ramen, we tried the vegan dumplings which were absolutely on point (dat dumpling sauce tho).  The space is also particularly cute- with a low-lying group table in the middle littered with beautiful ramen cookbooks and a bunch of cutesy two-seaters, I could see this being fantastic for both an intimate date or a group hangout.  The only star lost on this one was for the service- while our server was absolutely pleasant-as-punch she was erm, very out-to-lunch, and we ended up waiting quite some time to settle up (in an otherwise empty restaurant)."}
{"text":"Found this little place that serves the most authentic Japanese food in the city! Friendly staff and most importantly, awesome food. Can't imagine going to any other Raman bar now! Will be back again."}
