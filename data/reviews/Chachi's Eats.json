{"text":"We ordered these for lunch a while ago..... they were ok. 
The subs themselves were prepared with care... with lovely toppings such as pesto, provolone,  garlic aoili and red pepper spread ( great for us vegetarians....tasty!). The general consensus was that they were good but there was too much bread which created a bad balance between fillings and bread..... the owner of this location actually did a follow up call to our office to see if we liked our lunch *( how nice). I told him that they were filling ( which they were) but a little heavy on the bread... he told me that he has heard that before and they were talking with thier head office to switch to a different bread supplier. I  had them delivered to the office and they were on time, and cheerful. ( Clearly they care about the customer and product.)
All in all,  Great service, the product just needs a bit of tweaking ( Just my yelping opinion).  Dont let this stop you though.... I am sure that things are just getting better and better.  They are a bit expensive, but the ingredients are top notch."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich bar with fresh ingredients, and REAL meats and cheeses!  There are standard selections, and you can also build your own.

Their mac n' cheese is delish!  They also have a grilled cheese on special right now that is amazing - brie, jalapeno jack, provolone and fig chutney.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick-grab lunch.  While in Calgary, I usually stop here once a week for a sandwich.  Their selections of spreads are quite nice.  I usually try to mix in the red pepper spread with the pesto sauce or garlic aioli.  Good stuff! Prices are moderate.  If you want a $5 sub, go to Subway or Quizno's.

Bottom line: Good sandwiches, fast service. Perfect for a lunch stop."}
