{"text":"When we're by his house, the boyfriend and I go here for our Chinese fix.    I'm a big fan of their sweet and sour chicken.  I've tried a couple other menu items, but always come back to the chicken.  The breading has a great flavor to it; the chicken is nice and tender white meat.  Boyfriend usually goes for the teriyaki beef or the General Tsos.  It is always fresh, and you can taste the quality of the oil they fry the s/s chicken in.  I would not recommend the sushi here; I wasn't feeling hungry one time, and just got a California roll.  Decidedly mediocre.    As others have mentioned, the portions are HUGE.  My chicken is always overflowing in the container - usually they have to force the lid on.  Two large meals is generally $20, and translates into dinner + two more meals of leftovers.  If you're looking for some yummy, American-style Chinese take-out in Laveen... Lis Bowl is the way to go."}
{"text":"Food was awsome had some good flavors. Staff was very nice. I went and it was busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is a great for quick lunch away from work.  Food is quick, portion is generous, price is decent.  I will not order from their sushi menu, after all, it's a fast Chinese Food Restaurant. And whatever I had ordered were just sad looking. But their tofu dish with lo-men just can't be beat!  There are two servers in the place, the older lady was not as friendly and yelled at me and my co-workers once because we took 10 pairs of chopsticks and ordered only 9 entrees. (One of our co-worker wanted only egg-roll and soup for lunch and didn't order another entree.) The other times we were charged for sweet sour sauce for the egg-rolls that we ordered. (Which most place would provide when you order egg-roll.)  Over all, good get away dining place during lunch break, but won't go there if I have more time or options."}
{"text":"Wow! Just love! Sent hubby out to pick up the food. Ordered the smaller portions to save money and so everyone could get what they want. Ordered one dish no sauce and one dish extra spicy. They accomodated all of our requests. We fed six people for under $40, and the food is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Me encanta!! He.ido a comprar.tres veces y.la.comida esta riquisima y sobre todo que.te.la cocinan cuando.la.pides.. Lou mein chicken es el.mejor que.he probado.. $7.64 y te dan bastante.. en verdad se los recomiendo.. ;)"}
{"text":"The food is really good! Everything was cooked to order and tasted fresh. We had the beef with broccoli, orange chicken and the garlic beef and I'm looking forward to trying some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Lightening fast. Always delicious. Restaurant is very clean.  And light foods not heavy. Egg drop and wonton soup, orange chicken and lo main, egg rolls and cheese puffs are our favorite.  Never had anything that was under 4-5 stars. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Yes I love this place.....cheap, fast, and good lol....I eat here bout 2 times a week...my favorite is the lo mein"}
{"text":"I have lived all over the world....so I won't compare this to places like the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. What I will say is that if you live in the area you won't find better sushi anywhere. The prices are amazing and for those of you who are used to $10 sushi you know what I mean 16 piece California rolls for under $5 bucks.....try the shrimp tempura roll...but only get the half size or you will be too full. Overall the best values for the money anywhere in the area"}
{"text":"Great food! I always get the avocado salad.. It's sooo fresh! The family style tofu is great too. Hubby gets Kung pao chicken and loves it! This place is great for fresh, fast Chinese food."}
{"text":"Li's Bowl has become the neighborhood favorite of my husband and me.  We both LOVE their teriyaki pork and I LOVE their california rolls.  Their prices are very reasonable and they are always very friendly.  The one thing that we had that isn't so great is the egg rolls but finding a really good egg roll has eluded us for a very long time.  If anyone has any suggestions please let me know!!  Anyway, I highly recommend Li's Bowl for large portions at a very good price with a smile!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Best Wok off 51st & McDowell until I tried this place. They have very good food and they give you enough portion for two people. Will defintely recommend it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Thinking it was a resturant.  It has a fast food type atmosphere from which you order off a board. Food was not authentic and had some very generic tasting chinnese items. I have to say the shrimp  in Paco crumbs was tasty, but i would have a hard time coming back here again."}
{"text":"Great General Taos Chicken and AMAZING SUSHI!! Will will not go to any of the other so called chinese places down near Laveen but Li's Bowl. Their prices are very reasonable and they servings are resonable as well. Would definately recomend to everyone in the area!! And they are open till 11pm can't beat that!!"}
{"text":"Got Sesame chicken large. Taste was alright, but there was whole lot of bread and very little chicken. It should be named Sesame Breaded instead. I feel like all my week of healthy eating was ruined by this meal. It tasted ok though. MCD Asian alternative, made fresh, but very unhealthy!"}
{"text":"I love the food and regularly order until today, I order for pick up and they had my order wrong easy mistake I ordered spicy tuna roll they made tuna roll I noticed before I left so was able to explain the order was wrong the Asian lady in front replied \"whatever\" when I asked excuse me whatever what she said I know you said tuna.......and laughed....she obviously has no manners not understanding she didn't have to say that and then stated whatever I fix.  I have no plans to ever order from this establishment again"}
{"text":"Good sushi! Especially, with the slim pickings in South Phoenix. There Vegas roll is the best!"}
{"text":"The sesame chicken is delicious and you truly get a lot for your money. This is our go-to Chinese food spot."}
{"text":"Great tasting food.  I've been there on several occasions and haven't had a bad experience yet.  The food is donkey with trying.  I stick with general tsaos chicken, garlic chicken, and mongilolian chicken/beef and haven't been disappointed at all."}
{"text":"We frequent Li's bowl fairly regularly. Not a lot of options in Laveen, and Li's doesn't disappoint.  As vegetarians, there are a good amount of choices. Avocado salad, veggie lo mein, veggie fried rice, tofu and vegetables and avocado/cucumber rolls are our most frequent choices.   Always fast service too."}
{"text":"Love Li's bowl I'm a regular and will continue to be. My faves are the broccoli beef and the chicken lo main. I've been coming here since they opened and they are always happy and friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love to eat here. It is close to my neighborhood and is actually  pretty clean. The girl in the front is always very friendly and the food is super tasty. There is a lot of variety  and I as a cook myself do recommend this place to anyone that has a craving for sushi or chinese!!!"}
{"text":"I've been getting the Kung Pao Beef or the Pepper Steak lately and both of these are really dang good as well. The dishes are fairly not-spicy by default. I always have them add extra (whatever it is) to make them a bit spicier. They taste just as good either way though.  Three years later, I'm still going here. And damn it's still as tasty as ever."}
{"text":"This place is great! My family loves the food. It's classic Chinese american, and it's always done well. I'm moving out of the area soon and will definitely miss this place."}
{"text":"Went here the other day. I had the Gyoza that was AWESOME and I am so in love with the sweet and spicy sauce that comes with it. I also had the Pork Tariyaki that was very similar to Chinese Bar-b-Que pork. It was very tasty and came in a huge portion but the meat tasted like it was one day away from being rotten. Ugh. My mom had the teriyaki chicken and it looked so fresh and good, but she said it was bland. I didn't taste it so I'm going to have to take her word on it. Other than that, it was a great meal. I'm a fan of their gyoza and am considering giving their sushi a try. I say, if you're on that side of town - give it a go. You just may like it. :)"}
{"text":"I love food and most ppl would say I'm a foodie. With that being said, I wasn't happy with the food at all. The shrimp fried rice is a joke to say the least. The color of the rice threw me off. Not sure  that the rice was cooked all the way either. Garlic shrimp was ok. They just threw way to many different veggies in with it. Normally you would get the onion and bell peppers. Nope not this place here. It had baby corn, mushrooms, broccoli, onions, bell pepper and etc....This was my first and last time coming here."}
{"text":"I've been eating here at leaste 3 tims a month since they opened. i love the california rolls and the Gyoza are awsome but they recently changed the sauce it came with, more sweet and i really want the tonge burning fire sauce back. Egg rolls are awsome and a great size for only a buck. I loved the cheese puffs when the first opened, but recently i've started disliking them, not sure what changed. A much better place to eat than anything for several miles."}
{"text":"Ok-  first this I NOT fine dining it's a fast food that said:  It has a good selection of  Chinese and sushi. Worth a midweek stop for take out. Here's the run down.  Shrimp and lobster sauce- not a typical presentation but good with plenty of shrimp. Gyoza- deep fried with hot dipping sauce. Ate them all California supreme roll- yummy and made fresh while I watched. Rainbow roll- looked good and tasted good! Yellowtail sashimi- good for fast food Fried rice-standard  Over all worth a visit if you need take out on your way home from work. Will visit again."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise, the food is very clean. Not very greasy, like or places in the area. It is very hard to find good restaurants in this area and ones that serve good sushi almost impossible. This is definitely a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened. If you want fresh good food and a good price for lunch or dinner this is the place to come. They have a small menu but, what they make they make very well. They even have some sushi and it is double portion to what you would normally get somewhere else. There isn't any raw fish but, their crunch roll and Vegas Roll are awesome and cheap."}
{"text":"Had take out from Li's last night. Everything was back to its original deliciousness. Best orange chicken I've had from anywhere and their perfect, most incredible egg rolls are back to their original wonder!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place after the reviews I had read here on Yelp. I must have gone on a bad day because the food was just so-so, not bad but not good. The choices for sushi rolls, or any good restaurant in general, are pretty limited in this part of the valley so it will satisfy you craving for sushi rolls but just barely."}
{"text":"I should start with the caveat that I'm giving it four stars considering its location.  Anywhere else (San Francisco, Seattle, etc.) I think it would be just average Chinese food and sushi, but for Arizona I think it's definitely four stars.  The sushi is decent--nothing amazing but it's not bad either.  I've been pleased with the entrees I've tried and the servings are generous.  My family of four usually gets three entrees and a large soup, and we have plenty of leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"Not high on ambiance, but consistent quality. We order from here a few times a month. They make it quickly, and it's always hot and fresh. I love their Moo Goo Gai Pan!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby, reasonable prices, and ready within 10 minutes of calling. We went to town and sampled a little bit of everything: Pork dumpling appetizer was delicious! Shrimp tempura roll was good, but nothing special. This roll seems to taste the same no matter where you get it?! Garlic chicken was ok, although kinda sparse on the chicken. Sesame chicken seemed to be the overall winner. General Tso's chicken was ok, but no spice at all. The fried rice is like regular rice with some brown food coloring--disappointing for sure. Will continue to try and find a good chinese place on the westside of town!"}
{"text":"Warning!!!!!!!!! After reading a lot of positive reviews I decided to check this place out.  I placed an order for the house fried rice by phone and was told 10 minutes. I got there in about ten minutes and it was ready so I was in and out in less then 5 minutes.  Went back home ready to eat and was totally disappointed. The chicken, pork, and beef was all dry. It's as though they used leftover cooked meat to make the fried rice. It was more like rice and jerky. The egg roll was gross, flavor and texture. Now that I think about it, this food taste like reheated leftovers. I don't know why but south Phoenix Chinese food sucks compared to other parts out of South Phoenix. I won't be back however the cheese wontons were good."}
{"text":"The food here used to be delicious when i first started coming here, but over the years the quality has gotten worse. I used to love eating here but now I only come here if I'm in a hurry and even then the food is unsatisfactory. The customer service isn't really great either."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I went in yesterday with my family and We ordered a las Vegas roll, beef and broccoli, orange chicken and fried rice with chicken. The flavor was just ok but the worst was about to come! My whole family got sick! It was horrible absolutely horrible I called the owner to give them a heads up, not to get money just to let them know they should look into it. Nope!! The owner laughed and down played it seriously you could kill someone wow just wow!"}
{"text":"Such good Chinese food! My husband and I had been going to a place near us, but it was just not good. This place is awesome. Truly tasty, cooked perfectly and great portions.  The food was ready in no time, too.  We had orange chicken- just the right amount of kick, sesame chicken-tasty and chicken low mein- plenty of yummy vegetables. This will be our go-to Chinese place!"}
{"text":"The price was unbelievable, the portions are HUGE and the food was truly great. There's not much more to say than that. I don't give out 5 stars lightly and I was shocked to find food that good at this small, order at the counter, hole-in-the-wall. Try the orange chicken, it's the best I've had at anywhere besides a couple of very upscale restaurants. I will absolutely eat here again next time I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"For a walk-up, inexpensive Chinese restaurant, this is the best you are going to find in Laveen. They are super-fast, friendly, and the food is good fast Chinese.  They offer a broad selection of food, including basic sushi rolls. Note - the spicy sushi rolls have wasabi in them, not the normal spicy sauce I would expect. So if you don't like wasabi, don't order them spicy.  I haven't had much I don't like - try the cheese wontons, they are much better than that chain down the street. I would skip the egg rolls - they lack meat. The gyoza are good. And I like the wonton soup. the broth is just right, and the wontons chewy and savory.   Overall, you get a very large portion of delicious take out Chinese food, inexpensively and fast."}
{"text":"Only reason I gave them 1 star is because they have Pepsi. You can't be an Asian restaurant and not know how to make fried rice"}
{"text":"Good food, large portions and decent prices. We often phone our order in to save some time. Favorites include the pot stickers, chow mein, chicken and mixed veggies and seafood dynamite roll."}
{"text":"I tried it because I did not want Panda Express, plus I was wanting some California Rolls!  It is nice, simple and clean inside. Just another regular size fast food eating area. I ordered the Broccoli with Brown Sauce, which is like Broccoli Beef without the Beef. It came with one side, so I chose Fried Rice. I believe your only options are fried rice and chow mein. If you get two entrees you get two sides. The 8 pieces of California Rolls were fine, they don't seem to be freshly made though. All that for $10.26! This place is not that bad nor is it all that great! The broccoli was nice and crispy and the sauce was good, so the combination was nice and delectable. I was craving it and I was not disappointed! I typically stick to what I like and will not steer too far from what I know and like. The next time I will try the chow mein, I guess."}
{"text":"Amazingly great food and light on the wallet! I usually get something different every time now that they have an expanded menu"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and prices!! I love their house rice and their sushi dishes."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  Well I can't say everything here is great because the only thing I ever get is the Orange Chicken, but I can tell you they have the best Orange Chicken that I've ever had.  They have 2 sizes, regular and large.  Trust me when I tell you...regular is PLENTY!"}
{"text":"We probably get take out from Li's 3 or 4 times a month. For the most part, the food is quite good, but there have been some inconsistencies. My husband loves the veggie lo mein and the avocado salad, in part because of their huge portions. The won ton soup has become our favorite and the cheese won tons (like rangoons) are always fresh and more flavorful than many other places.   I think what makes me give Li's Bowl 3 rather than 4 stars is the sushi. The quality really depends on the day. They must get a shipment of fresh fish in before the weekend, because Friday's sushi is always great, but Sunday's and Monday's fish can be mushy and not so fresh. Li's is one of the better places to eat in Laveen, however. Just pick your raw fish days carefully."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese food place primarily not an Asian fusion. The two rolls that we got (Las Vegas Roll and Crunchy Roll) were flavorless and almost made my wife vomit. The Chinese food was rather good (chicken friend rice and sweet & sour chicken)  Pro-tip - Avoid the Japanese portion of their menu and center in on the Chinese portion to be safe. Their sushi was neither fresh or tasty."}
{"text":"Not my kuons location in Pomona CA, but it will do Just do not order the shrimp fried rice"}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  I just moved to laveen and was craving some fried rice. The reviews were high so I tried it. Big mistake.  The food was over cooked and lacked flavor.  I tried 2 sushi rolls, gyoza, and rice...what a waste!"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of their chicken. I love their fried chicken wings. I've checked a lot of places in AZ and is hard to find some. I would take Li's chicken over Churchs anyday."}
{"text":"First time at Li's Bowl. Been driving by it for years but a friend recommended it so, why not?  I arrived at 5 PM on a Monday and there were two other parties, so the ordering went swiftly.   The decor was bright and clean plus the furniture was in good shape. Given the neighborhood, that's a plus.   I ordered a small rainbow roll and 4 cheese wontons, based on Yelp reviews. I added a large can of Arizona and it came to $10.65. Cheap!  Nervous!  It arrived in about 4 mins and looked prepackaged. It had plastic grass to make it look, idk, better?  They offered super cheap plastic forks, packet condiments and thin napkins. They were pretty small rolls as well. I was okay with the flavors but couldn't get past the non-traditional stuff. Oh, but they had an aquarium to make it look traditional.  Lame.    The portions weren't overwhelming so I got a plate of General's Chicken to go. It was nice and hefty but, upon returning home I saw that it was 3/4 rice. Also the GC was very sweet and soggy.   Compared to Panda Express, Li's was better in menu selection and prices. Panda wins for Chinese-American faves, popularity and quality.   Results: Panda, sadly."}
{"text":"Pros   Food was good compared to other options in the area Was in and out in less than 10 minutes but I was the only one there Service was ok, didn't seem very welcoming but I was taking it to go  Cons I read so many reviews about portion size and I guess I came on a bad day,it barley fed me and my 2 year old! I was still hungry and that never happens! Didn't care for the onions in the fried rice. There was more vegetables as well than meat. I guess if I'm hungry for Chinese I'll come here or try some place else."}
{"text":"One of my favorite take out sushi spots.  I even bring my friends from work here to eat lunch.  The sushi is very cheap but the quality is great.  The food is definitely fresh.  Sushi rolls that normally costs $16 for a 18 roll only costs around $7 here.  Fried rice is also good, but i normally pick this up on the way home to eat sushi."}
{"text":"Great selection of food, tasty and pretty cheap too!  Service is pretty good.  For the people who doesnt like spicy on their dish, you can always ask them to NOT to add spicy on the dish that you ordered. Or even certain vegetables you dont eat like my wife, she only likes certain veggies on her chow mein or lo mein. Hope this helps"}
{"text":"I think 3 stars is pretty perfect for this place. It's not spectacular. It's not terrible. I find Li's Bowl is really fairly average.  That is to say, if I'm sitting at home and I'm craving some Chinese food but don't want to drive a long distance, I'll go here without much hesitation. This has happened a number of times, matter of fact, and that's definitely not a bad thing. This just isn't the type of place I would go looking for \"great' Chinese food at; nor is it a place I would take somebody promising the same."}
{"text":"I think any restaurant that disrespects a customer deserves a one.   Just took take out  and specifically asked for the egg drop soup to be served dine in, while we waited for our take out.  A long wait ensues - about 15 mins - no soup, no take out. Our order gets called, so I come up to the counter. I point out that we did order the soup for dine-in. The woman nods then says... \"Hmmm... Whatever...\" She proceeds to call out the next take out order.  I walk out and tell myself I would never give these people a penny of my business... Ever!"}
{"text":"Perfect. Wings are huge and fried perfectly. All 10 didn't even fit in the box. And that is a small sesame chicken, small Mongolian beef, and small pork fried rice. Egg rolls are huge too but I ate them!"}
{"text":"I love how quick they have your order ready! You call it in and in 10 min its good to be picked up. My favorite is the House Lo Mien and Wonton Soup. Their Vegas roll is good and the price is very decent. I defiantly would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been going there for 6 years. Definitely less in the last few years. It's sad to see that the food quality went downhill every time I go. They went from the best orange chicken place to one of the worst. Soggy chicken is worse orange sauce. The lo mein is still decent, sushi is ok and really one of the only sushi options in the area"}
{"text":"OMG - Kung Pao Chicken!!! SO damn good! Never order the small, you get Bang for the buck! on food here with the large. The lady handed my amazing Kung Pao Chicken, and my arm literally dropped, had to weigh it, 3.5 lbs of food for under $10. General Tsao's chicken is also amazing! Not a bog fan of chinese food night, but always williing to go for some Li's Bowl!"}
{"text":"We dined here the last time I was in the area based on the high reviews. Price and portions were great as everyone states but the food was mediocre.   We had an order of the general chicken, house wings and teriyaki chicken to share for 3 of us. There was enough food for at least 5. Everything tasted alright but I felt everything was a little \"off\". Like if it was missing some zing factor. General Chicken was missing the slight vinegary taste. It was just sweet. House wings were more on the sweet, than salty or garlicky. I think thats what it is, everything was more sweet than anything else and just too sweet for my liking. I was surprised that they use real jasmine rice here which was a good plus. Not the cheap wanna be kind chinese fast food restaurants uses to lower costs.  I'd put this along with the any other fast food chinese joint. Wont be back for their Chinese food, but maybe for their sushi offerings since they looked tempting and were also priced nicely... but thats a big MAYBE."}
{"text":"We liked Li's Bowl, but were not wow'ed by our experience.  It is a nice local take out joint, with decent food and good portions/pricing.  The service was fast and friendly. We had some sushi rolls and a couple of their combo meals.  Again, good but not great.    It wasn't anything super-spectacular, but we enjoyed it enough and would probably go there again if we had an immediate Chinese food take out craving."}
{"text":"I couldn't tell you what is good sushi and what is bad, but I love the sushi here... Las Vegas roll is my favorite and I often get the kung pao chicken too."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. my coworkers would tell me how good this place is but I was dissatisfied. You are better off going to Panda Express, seriously. I didn't even finished eating my plate. Never coming back here. There are hardly any good spots to eat in the Laveen area"}
{"text":"I've been going here for over a year, and I must say that they keep getting better and better. I would have given them a three rating the first time, but I believe the recipes consistently improve. I am a lover of General Tso chicken, and get it every time I go. My wife likes to vary her purchases, and agrees with the assessment that the food is getting better as well. It's really just a typical Chinese food place, but the execution is well above average. Prices are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and stopped on last Saturday. I ordered the shrimp and broccoli and later that night I started getting stomach discomfort. The next day I had and still have food poisoning. Will never return. I'm still sick."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food's not pricey at all, it's quick after ordering and their food tastes pretty good! Cheap eats and not a chain, family owned."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Always hot and fresh! Best in the area! We've been coming her for nearly six years, and the food is always consistent! Great quick friendly service every time!"}
{"text":"I'd never heard of Li's Bowl until today.  I came across it by chance and stopped in for lunch.  It's a nice little place in the middle of a nondescript strip mall and seemed to have a bit of traffic, so I thought I'd try it.  There's minimal Asian decor, but enough to keep it's A-Pac emphasis without being tacky.  The service was friendly and quick.  My order was ready in about five minutes, so I was pleased with the turnaround time.  While waiting,  I grabbed a carryout menu and noticed it said they have \"catering by appointment.\"  When I inquired about how much notice was needed, the employee had no idea.  I thought that was a little odd but, whatever.  I wasn't in a particularly adventuresome mood, so I ordered my old standby of Orange Chicken with Fried Rice.  Both we so-so.  Both were served piping hot but the Orange Chicken was so tough it split my plastic fork at the very first stab.  I'm not sure if it was a matter of too much \"batter\", being slightly overcooked or a combination of the two, but I've had more tender chicken for sure.  The rice was fine, but had been seasoned with something that gave it the flavor of powdered L****n soup.  Pass the soy sauce, please!  Again, not the best I've had.  I will also say my \"medium\" portion size was large; enough for lunch and leftovers for dinner.  If in the area again, I'd consider trying Li's Bowl again, but I'm curious to know what they can do with their sushi rolls and may opt for that, instead."}
{"text":"Li's Bowl was great for chicken lo mein and fried wontons! Large comfortably serves 2! I love sushi so we tried it and it was not very good. Stick with the lo mein! The grilled chicken and veggies in it were amazing!"}
{"text":"Just not good.  This was my first time dining at Li's Bowl.  My lunch companion and I selected the Chicken Fried Rice, Eggdrop, and Wonton Soup.  My lunch companion said the egg drop soup was okay.  However, the won ton soup and Chicken fried rice was very bland and very greasy, yes even the soup was greasy.   Overall just not good food. I'd like to end on a positive note. The service was outstanding. The staff is friendly and inviting and will explain everything on their menu.  The prices and serving portions can't be beat.  I just wish the food was a better quality."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Everything ive tried is amazing. I love the hot and sour soup the chicken and veggies with brown souce."}
{"text":"The staff is very nice and the food is awesome!  The garlic chicken is the best.  Good food at a good price. Great value!"}
{"text":"Love, love....love this place!  EVERYTIME and I mean every time, I am happy I came.  They make my sushi order quickly even though the place is usually busy.  I have brought friends that have ordered from the full menu and they, too, like the food.   Broccoli is always done right: green and slightly crispy...I love it!"}
{"text":"My favorite for quick Chinese in the neighborhood.  Veggies and shrimp or chicken or beef, healthy and yummy.  Food has been consistently good over the years."}
{"text":"General tso's chicken is my all time favorite thing...this place is spot on everytime"}
{"text":"I went in for a quick lunch and ordered shrimp fried rice and shrimp tempura roll. I mostly likely won't order the Tempura again...sushi isn't their speciality. But the fried rice is okay nothing spectacular. But it was hot and fresh and that's half the battle when ordering out."}
{"text":"Used to go here frequently and the food was excellent....sad to report that they've gone down hill. Was in the area and went there....my friend ordered the teriyaki chicken which he reported as flavorless....and made him sick in addition!! I ordered a Las Vegas Roll.....VERY disappointed! Poor flavor & extremely small to what they used to be. Needless to say.....will never go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  There is nothing I have tried there that was not a solid, well made dish.  Good sushi, good soup, good appetizers,  good everything.  I cannot think of a single dish that really stands out, but every single item I've tried is fresh, exactly the right temperature, large portioned, and seasoned exactly the way it's supposed to be.  The prices are very good also.  I go to Li's often and will keep going for a long time!"}
{"text":"Large size could feed some entire families. Great portion sizes for the price! Food is good"}
{"text":"Honestly, it's good but not great. You get what you pay for. If you want awesome chinese you go to a high end chinese restaurant. But for neighborhood chinese and a fast lunch, this place is a good one. Never had anything I didn't like and they were friendly."}
{"text":"Looooove the food so much. Always go with some kind of fried rice, although chicken fried rice is my favorite. If you ever need a quick fix, this place is wonderful and the portion sizes are good too. Even a small dish has a ton of food (I had eaten it and forgotten to take a picture for the review, oops... It was that good). My family often orders their orange chicken, fried rice, and soup."}
{"text":"Love there lo mein, Vegas and tempura roll.. so much flavor and really cheap compare to other places. Also, the most I recommend is to try there chicken wings OMG it's so good u won't regret it... if u love chines food and sushi this is the place u must try!! It's worth every penny..."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after reading these reviews. I was not completely disappointed though, the Mongolian beef was really good but the fried rice and sushi weren't good at all."}
{"text":"Confused by all the high reviews for their sushi. Usually yelp is right on. It is low-priced sushi without a doubt, so I wasn't expecting anything gourmet, but I gotta say...this sushi wasn't edible. The sushi you find in a Fry's grocery store or Whole Foods is better. I tried the Vegas Roll and their Alaskan Roll. The Alaskan roll was extremely fishy and couldn't eat more than one piece. The Vegas roll was funky. Can't quit put my finger on what it was...just didn't taste good...and definitely didn't taste like a Vegas Roll. Had a stomach ache after eating a couple pieces. Save your money and buy one roll at a better place. That one roll will fill you up more than two rolls that are inedible.   Can't comment about their chinese food because I've never tried it...hope its better."}
{"text":"Li's bowl has great egg drop soup! Unfortunately this is one of those places where they won't give you white meat for things like orange chicken, lemon chicken etc. At most of Chinese spots they'll let you substitute just for a bit more money. It's a hybrid restaurant so they also sell sushi."}
{"text":"First time here! Very clean! Open space! Nice employees! Quick too. Would come again!"}
{"text":"This place has great prices, huge portions, and delicious food. We really enjoyed eating here. The service was friendly and fast too. We were very pleased with the sweet and sour chicken, Mongolian beef, orange chicken and the raw salmon sushi we got. The egg rolls could use something other than cabbage in them and my husband thought the Las Vegas roll was missing something. On our trip to Phoenix we have had terrible service almost everywhere we have gone. This hole-in-the-wall Chinese place was the best by far."}
{"text":"This place is decent. I enjoyed the shrimp tempura roll. I think the sesame chicken is way too sweet. I do go from time to time, but not too often."}
{"text":"After reading Yelp reviews, I decided to try this place. Good Chinese is hard to find anywhere. It's on the way home and I was craving Chicken Fried Rice with a side of extra green onion. Duck juice too please, but they don't do that here.  Here's a break down of my stars:  1 Star:  Quick Service. While at the counter I had Yelp up on my phone and I think the lady saw it because I placed my order she gave the order to the kitchen and started speaking in Chinese. It sounded like, \"hurry up with order, this new customer and he on Yelp!\"  My order came out ahead of 2 orders previously placed by customers ahead of me. Hmm. Ok, impressive.  2 Star:  Tons of Rice. The small box was stuffed with rice and generous amount of chicken. I had it for dinner and brunch the next day.  3 Star:  Friendly face with a smile for service and rightly priced. The side of onion was only 50cents extra with my total being about $5. The place was also clean on the inside."}
{"text":"Picked up a boat load of take out from Li's.   Large order of sauced wings, General Tso's, fried rice with shrimp, some noodles, some white rice, some cream cheese wontons, and some pork gyoza.    The wings were huge and juicy.  Took me 2 meals to eat 16 wings with some rice, so plenty of food there, for sure, but they didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I added some Franks on the first day, and some garlic hot sauce on the second.   That made them quite yummy :)  I would say everything was good, $30 worth of food lasted 2 people 3 meals, so can't beat the price!  Glad to have an Asian take out place nearby!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They use high quality meats to get make really delicious food. Take out is always ready in 10mins and you get good portions for your money. Sushi isn't bad here either for being a Chinese food place."}
{"text":"I had the mixed veggies in brown sauce and my husband and the teriyaki chicken. We both thought it was absolutely delicious and will definitely be coming back. Sushi was good too, got the job done. Good food, fast service, no complaints."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time back in April 2017 and the food was good and plentiful.   Have been back about 4 times since and in my opinion, the food hasn't been as good as the first time.   It's never traveled well. All 4 times their containers leaked and I ended up with a soggy mess in the bag and on my car seats (always take a friend to carry it while driving, especially one that doesn't mind hot brown sauce on their lap). Maybe that's why they don't deliver?  My last dish there a few nights ago was sweet and sour chicken. Simply not good at all. It was an overlooked oily mess.  Chicken pieces were hard and got 2 rubbery pieces that I had to spit out.   Sorry, Li's Bowl. We had so much potential."}
{"text":"I always look forward to eating here every time I am in Phoenix.  The food is great! My favourite is chicken and Broccoli  extra spicy with whit rice.  They also do special  request like add mushrooms.  My Grandchildren are picky eaters and they also love the food.."}
{"text":"I ordered Sesame Chicken and fried rice and my chicken was so soggy, and just sitting in a bowl of watery sauce. The fried rice was really just Mexican Rice. I also ordered sushi, and it wasnt that bad... but obviously pre packaged. Definitely not a good experience. I'll stick to Red Dragon on 51st Ave & Baseline."}
{"text":"Great food for the price.  Best sushi around in my opinion.  Great for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"I'm starting to love this place. It's a far cry from my time in China but the flavors are good and they are on point with orders. I always get a little sushi and decent I will say.  But like America decent, not like Japan decent.  Also, I always get Lo-Mein because I'm white but here it is FANTASTIC. So greasy but SO delicious!"}
{"text":"It's not the best chinese food I've ever had, but definitely the best IMO in South Phx/Laveen. Normally the food is fast and fresh and pretty solid as far as quality. Tonight was a little different though as the Hot N Sour soup was bland. Still, it's convenient, has good hours, and is inexpensive. My go-to in the SoPho."}
{"text":"Best sushi and Chinese food around! Not to mention probably the cheapest. You can't go wrong at Li's!"}
{"text":"I'm used to real tasting authentic Chinese food. And this was far from it. I ordered change Chicken lo mein and an egg roll. The crust of the egg roll had a weird greasy taste and my lo mein smelled like fish which I thought was odd. Also the chicken was not real chicken. Lots of coating of sauce and no meat flavor to it. I was very upset I spent my money here. I see why they had no business when I walked in.  Only go here if you're desperate for Chinese food and don't care for flavor or quality. Sad to say panda taste a a lot better than this place."}
{"text":"Lemon chicken is the bomb! Great servings....!"}
{"text":"Fried rice was just ok -- somewhat bland.   Lo Mein was good.  However was expexting better based on previous ratings."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  They really need to expand their veggie menu, although I still haven't gotten tired of the House Tofu dish.  I think we've gotten that every time we've gone to Li's Bowl, but have also tried the House Shrimp and a couple other dishes.  All in all, this is some of the better takeout in our part of town."}
{"text":"A lot of food for a little money - it's made fresh right then and there and comes out piping hot. They also have sushi which I have not ventured towards. The mongolian beef and kung pao chicken are really good."}
{"text":"The food is decent. The service is horrific. Fist time I ordered from there they forgot 3 items in my order.  Second time I order from them they forgot 2 items. Then when I call to ask about them the people talk to you like you're bothering them. The restaurant wasn't even busy so they can't even use that as an excuse for why they're not checking the orders. Never go here."}
{"text":"Over priced and disappointed ..I order teriyaki chicken with fried rice.it came out to 12 dallors ..the chicken didn't even have teriyaki and it came with just chicken and peppers .the fried rice was small after I ate I was still hungry ..I rate the food 6 out of 10 nothing special. ..I could of got way more items and food at panda express and for a cheaper price ...would I come back No ....they really need to add more food to the plates to make it worth the prices...panda express is way better and cheaper......"}
{"text":"I love there shrimp and lobster with fried rice.  Good value no frills restaurant but clean, and folks are friendly!"}
{"text":"Greatest place! I love their sushi! Even if your not into raw sushi they most certainly have fried sushi like the vegas rolls!!! So  delicious, i so recommend this place! If you have not yet been here you gotta stop on by!"}
{"text":"Had the Orange chicken and garlic chicken and it's ok, I've had better.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I ordered yellow tail sashimi and tempura sushi roll. The lady called my name and I went to pick up my food. She looked me in the eye and said \"these two bags\". Then handed me the receipt with my order. I drove 15 minutes home from a long day of work and found some fried shrimp and what looks like beef and broccoli. If the sushi was half bad as the poop wrong order she gave me I wouldn't even go back to get my order."}
{"text":"This place sucks!! I moved to the valley and have yet to find that \"go to \" chinese spot, sooo I decided to give this spot a try. I called my order in and was assured by the employee that all the food is cooked to order, always fresh. So I picked up my food, and what do you know, I got some old azz fried rice with some microwaved shrimp. WTF??!! I give this place 2 thumbs down and I would not eat here if I was hungry as a hostage :("}
{"text":"I love this place continually since they have opened. Fair prices and consistently great food. They are quick to make a call in order and it never takes more then 10-15 minutes. If they delivered I'd be in debt."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and it is pretty standard fast food Chinese fare. The service was pleasant and quick, but the prices are a little high for what they offer. I had a dine-in chicken lo mein that was crammed into a little foam to-go burger box. It seems like a plate would be less expensive and more appealing. The food was average, but unlike other Chinese restaurants, the dish didn't come with any soup or sides, not even a fortune cookie, everything was à la carte.  If I'm in the neighborhood I might stop in again, but it's not a place I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"My typical dish of choice is Orange Chicken with Fried Rice.  It's AMAZING.  I wish I could afford to eat every meal there...  I no longer live in Laveen, but I will be travelling back to Laveen (and who wants to do that) just to have lunch/dinner at my favorite chinese place in Phoenix.  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"We love this place for take out! Big portions, although I've been disappointed by the sushi the couple times we've tried that. But the orange chicken is good and my 18mo son loves the fried tofu. And the egg rolls are delish!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the rice was a little hard but still good. I only tried the California roll but it had a very simple fresh taste that I expect from a California roll. I'm sure I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Rice and sushi were great. Service was fast and we loved that they had duck sauce !!    We will be back"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese food places in Laveen anything with shrimp is very tasty they also have large portions.This restaurant is in a great location and in a easy place to get too"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Good prices, good food and good service.  I really enjoy the garlic chicken nom nom nom.  We had moved away and missed this place but now we are back and glad that it's around the corner."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here quite a few times now.  We love the cream cheese wontons and pork gyoza.  The sushi is great and cheap, as well.  I was reluctant to try the sushi here, but I'm glad I did, as it's a good alternative when I can't get to a sushi bar or want a cheaper option.  My only complain is I wish they would deliver! :)"}
{"text":"Items ordered: california roll, lo mein, and egg roll. The food was a good option for fast food asian dining. The restaurant itself was clean you can see the chef cooking your food, which is cool. The sushi rolls tasted pre made and not so fresh. The noodles were a bit greasy.  Tge egg rolls were super crunchy and acceptable. I would return to try other options. This place is promising."}
{"text":"This place is ok in a pinch if you are really craving chinese food.   We've ordered takeout a few times and they seem to always forget something.   Last time it was our egg roll.  The food is ok, nothing spectacular.   The rice is often dry, the chicken is overcooked (better than undercooked I suppose), and the sushi is often room temp.  The place is clean, but not someplace to sit and eat if you want a nice environment.  The staff isn't rude, but they aren't exactly pleasant.  Like I said, ok in a pinch but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Am i the  only one who thinks this place is bit that great. Their servings for large are not that big and when i ordered beef fried rice there was hardly any beef in it. Their drinks are over priced, they sell sushi but honestly would you buy sushi from a Chinese place. Its like buying Mexican tacos from an Italian restaurant. Never coming back here."}
{"text":"I really thought I'd updated this already, since it's been almost 2 years since my first review. We still eat here often! Everything I said above still stands but we've tried a few other dishes they serve as well.   Orange chicken - Decent but super spicy, was even a bit hot for my hubby who was raised on Cajun cooking.  Sweet and Sour chicken - Delicious, the sweet and sour isn't runny at all.They also put the sauce on the side which is great, I hate having soggy take out!  Broccoli and Beef - Pretty tasty, I get this when I'm not in the mood for sushi. Egg rolls - Neither of us found them very good. Garlic chicken - My husband liked it, far too spicy for me.  Fried Rice - Husband likes it. I dislike fried rice in general.   If you're in the area and you haven't tried this place, you really need to!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, way cheaper than other Chinese restaurants. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Li's Bowl is as close as your going to get for the back East Chinese Food experience. They have just about everything except the 4 Chicken Wings on the menu. We've been living in the Laveen area for just about 4 years and this is our go to place! The Garlic Chicken/Garlic Shrimp is really good, the House Lo Mein is great, and their Fried rice (any variation) is amazing!"}
