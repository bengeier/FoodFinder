{"text":"No sound allowed on prelims of UFC fights - before 8:00 pm. Owner's orders. Food is decent though."}
{"text":"The server was good at first, kept refreshing our drinks.. Then she got sloppy. Kept missing us when checking the other tables. When I got my wings (2 lbs of mild chicken wings) they were dry and hard to eat!! Like they were in the deep fryer for too long or kept under the hot lamp for awhile. I hate 3 chicken wings and decided I'd rather go get fast food from the DQ close by then force myself to eat another bad chicken wing. I told the server when she finally came to us to ask if we wanted the bill. I let her know the wings were awful, hard and dry. I could barely bite into them. I told her to let her kitchen staff know not to deep fry or keep them under the hot lamp for too long anymore as this is what happens. I ate 3 chicken wings out of 2 lbs of chicken wings. And the server still put the $25 chicken wings on the bill. When we got the bill I was shocked and mentioned \"wow! Didn't know I have to pay for the crap wings that I didn't eat plus go get another meal!\" She just smiled and waited for us to pay. We are never going back, and we've made sure to tell all of our friends and family how awful the customer service and food was. I own a run a business as well, and if one of my clients had told me she/he was not impressed with something, I would try to make it right. No tip for that server! $0!"}
{"text":"Burgers on special Mondays and it's a great deal I get it with soup of the day 10.50 all in"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for breakfast and the food has been exceptional. The service is always slow, but it's a cool pub and a great atmosphere to have a drink. They used to have a cheap weekend breakfast of bacon and eggs and toast for something like just over $5. Not sure if they still have that or not. The last time I was there, we had a few drinks and ended up back at my friend's place with a group of people we met at the pub. One of the guys bought us five jagger-bombs (give or take) each and things went accordingly from there. But it was a hell of a good time and the Bull & Finch is a nice looking pub inside. Their patio only offers a view of the parking lot and their service is dreadful, but if you just want to drink, you could do a lot worse...."}
{"text":"The Bull is a local hangout for people living and working in the SE. It has a good mix of people from those in there teens and 20's to people in their 40's. It's a great pub with fantastic food, which never disappoints. Their wings are great, and big compared to most places. The staff is great, and conversational. They play most sports when they're on, and have fight nights for boxing, and UFC events on PPV if your into that. It's a great spot that's close to home if you live in the Douglas Dale, Mac Towne, or McKenzie Lake area that doesn't disappoint, if you're looking for a pub or bar with great food, a fantastic staff and has a UK type atmosphere inside. All in all, it's a favourite for my friends and I if we want to go out for drinks and get some good grub."}
{"text":"The two primary criteria for myself when evaluating a pub, especially one with a name like The Bull & Finch, is what is on tap and the service. Let's start with the beer selection, it is comical at best. There is a house brand and I thought this is a good sign but it turns out it is re-branded Black Label, and this is the good news. I would of expected some imported pints (besides Guinness) but this was not the case.  Criteria 2, service. This was also comical as it was some of the poorest service I have experienced in Calgary. There was about 2 tables per server the night I was there. Our server pretty much ignored her 2 tables and spent most of her time watching the NHL All Star game draft. The other table in her section got tired of waving at her to get her attention and could get up, walk over to her and interrupt her television.   I did manage some food despite the beer being disappointing and horrible service. I had a beef dip and it was pretty tasty, unfortunately not good enough to cover up the other shortcomings.  If you want a decent pint or service than give this place a pass, if you want tasty beef dip and don't mind waiting than give it a try."}
{"text":"Used to go here years ago and it was always a solid bet for some good wings. Tried it again this week since I was in the neighbourhood and it's still solid. We tried their 'death' wing one night and couldn't manage more than 1, some serious scolville units.  They have a 25Â¢ wing deal on Wednesdays and some great flavours like Cajun Comfort, Dyin' Buffalo, Spicy Parm and a Salt & Pepper you have to check out!  Make sure you add this place to your chicken wing to-do list for Calgary."}
{"text":"Two words: wing night. Everybody does it, but this place does it right. Big wings make it worth the drive. We tried hot Parmesan, honey garlic and salt and pepper. Salt and pepper was ok, honey garlic was good, Parmesan was amazing. Good service too. Our server was quick with refills and super friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Ordered our food and waited about 45 mins. Then the waitress showed up and told us she forgot to put our order in. We were in a hurry so we were going to leave then she said she'll check with the kitchen to see how long and that she would give us a discount for us waiting. So the food came out about 5 mins later. Got my bill and there wasn't a discount. She said that the manager wouldn't issue one. The reason we stayed and waited longer because she convinced us to stay and give us a discount. Well that didn't work out. We would eat here about twice a month not a huge loss for them really but I won't go back because they cared more about my $50 then me as a customer."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to grab some drinks and grub before an event, we found Bull & Finch.  Informed when we sat down that the special that night was BOGO half off appies we knew we had to take advantage of this deal!  After humming and hawing for a bit, our server helped us decide and we ordered the lettuce wraps, poutine, mac & cheese bites and mozzarella sticks.  Everything came out all at once and piping hot too! My fave? The mac & cheese bites - gooey pasta and cheese in a crisp batter served with ranch. Least? Probably the lettuce wraps. Could have done without the rice and iceberg lettuce would have been easier for wrapping than romaine   Although I'm rarely in these neck of the woods, it's nice to know we have a spot we can hit up  should we be back in the area again!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with there bull shit waver for the real hot wings get hotter with less bs else where ."}
{"text":"Thank you for making my Donair as a wrap instead of in a Pita. The wrap is good. I'll try again, but your Poutine was horrible. It was built on salted fries and negligence. I'll eat the sandwich. I'll fling the Poutine at North Korea. Absolutely disgusting. Please be better than your Poutine."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  This is a friendly neighbourhood with plenty of deals and great food. It's not a super classy establishment but that's not what they going for either.  Their staff are always friendly and I've never had a bad experience. I would recommend if you happen to be in the area or live nearby"}
{"text":"Bull & Finch is in the deep south next to a bunch of RV Dealerships that sprawl next to the burbs. It's not an award winning high-traffic location for a pub, and therefore not much opportunity to capture an exciting and cool niche. What they do provide is a little something for everyone in the area, and each item doesn't interfere with the next.  They have TV's but they're not obnoxious. Watch them if you want, or ignore them if you don't. There are a few pool tables set up with enough room that nobody is knocking over your drink or asking you to move when you just want to have dinner. VLT's are there if you want to play them, but it's by no means a noisy casino.  While it looks like they just went out bought the \"Irish Pub\" collection from Ikea, the place is really relaxed and rather stylish.  The service was great, and the food was quite impressive. I got this giant loaf of baked brie with warm flat bread and a Timmie's Jam Donut style strawberry filling to dip it in for $8.99. Top notch.  This place is really mainstream, so you could look at it as really average, or you could see it as somewhere anyone could enjoy. Bull & Finch, I liked you. You were a solid cut above most suburban pubs I've been to.  Cheers,"}
{"text":"Went here on Friday of the Easter weekend that most people have off for breakfast and it was very good. The only breakfast option that they were serving was \"The Morning After Breakfast\" for a whoping $6. The breakfast came with your typical hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. The restaurant lost a star because the bacon was way over done and too crispy for my liking.  They lost another star because generally establishments offer more than one option in replace of bacon but you could only get bacon and for me who doesn't eat pork I just gave it away. Usually they will give you another egg in replace or sausage, etc.  This establishment lost another star because to only offer one breakfast item, even for a pub, on any given day is extremely strange.  This establishment gained a star in their review because the price for the breakfast being only $6 was extremely fair.  In addition to this the cedars here were amazing which I was surprised about! Therefore ending this establishment off with a 4 star review :)"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch ... it was so bad we left most of it.    The chicken wings with hot parmesan sauce were dry and tough ... more dried out roadrunner than tasty chicken and the sauce was too syrupy.  Fish and chips were a disappointment.  The fish was fried at the wrong temp so the batter was this soggy spongy dough rather than being lovely and crisp ... so much for the \"Alexander Keith beer batter\".  The pub itself tries hard but its fittings are cheap and in need of a good clean and repair in places.  The only plus was the good service from our waitress who took our food order (though not the first who screwed up our drinks order).   In short, I'd rather have skipped lunch altogether."}
{"text":"I've honestly tried to hold back this review, but this place has consistently offered a bad experience all too often. The service is always slow, and after multiple tries to give them a chance, I won't be back. It doesn't take much to check on the table, but the servers almost spitefully avoid putting in any effort. If you want bare minimum this is the place. The foods half decent, but not worth the headache."}
{"text":"Busy during lunch and after-work hours, the place caters to the Quarry Park businesses and community.   A pretty typical pub, the good is of good quality and cheaper than is to be expected in this town! Be prepared for Texas-sized, \"working-man\" portions.   Patio could be bigger."}
{"text":"So it's been just about a year, and I'm back at the Bull & Finch again. I'm pretty sure we've even got the same server.   Honestly, two things keep us coming back. 1) location. When you're out at the Saints Rugby Field and the Clubhouse is closed, this is your next best option 2) Free nachos for teams with 6 players or more. Another plate of free nachos for every multiple of 6 you have. Although if you're in there a lot, and you have 11 players, they've been known to still bring my frisbee team that second plate of nachos.  Lots of room for large groups, a couple of pool tables, and food that's on par with what you'd expect for pub food, it's a-ok."}
{"text":"Came here for wings night. I really did not like the wings. flavourless (seasonings didn't even stick to the wings and were mostly on the plate). ....and very DRY wings.  space is fairly large with pool tables and the bar in the centre of the room."}
{"text":"Two visits. One was ok, the other was a miss.  I want to say the food here is good (for a pub) but there is something nagging me that holds me back from that. On my most recent visit I went with the pesto chicken caesar and a plate of wings since it was wing night. The pesto on the salad was a nice change to the typical caesar. The wings were ok, nothing bad, but you can get better at many other places.  Service is what drops this place down the list for me. The last server I had was obnoxious. She had trouble pointing out the gluten free items on the menu, even after practically declaring she was an expert on the menu and we could ask her anything. On her follow-up trips she seemed very oblivious and not very professional."}
{"text":"80% empty and it took 40 minutes for food to come out.  No drink refill in the hour we sat. Ordered medium rare steak, initial steak was seared and raw. Sent it back and it came back raw in the middle.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"Average Pub Fair, my fish and chips were a little soggy. My beer was fresh the service was prompt and is a place to stop for lunch it seems like an ideal spot. Not too loud, standard Irish Pub feel."}
{"text":"Dark, clean, cozy. Very much a pub one would expect - in a place where a pub may not be necessarily expected. A bit tight parking in front, landfill-pretty surroundings, there is something depressing about the location. Easy to drive in, not much to do in the vicinity. Except for may going to Rona next door and buying a bucket, or something?  Service was friendly, but on a veeeeaary slow side. Not like they didn't care, but more like they cared - just in a relaxed fashion. Once arrived though, food was quite decent, and drinking menu, while not particularly inspiring, was quite tolerable.  Not sure if the place is a franchise, but would bet it is, just by the feeling of it (and I was wrong - just got a comment from the business owner, explaining that they are not!) An absolutely ok place to go though. Not something to crave, but very visitable if you find yourself in the area."}
