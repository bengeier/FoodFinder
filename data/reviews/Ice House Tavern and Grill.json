{"text":"Nice place, good environment to watch games. Wing nights are Mon & Wed.  The wings are delicious but the service is pretty slow even when they aren't that busy."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. They turned down a veteran friend of mine becuase they said that they reserve the right to refuse service. They poured the drink and then dumped it."}
{"text":"They used to be good... 20 years ago... first the food went downhill... then of course the awful service and awful attitudes from the employees followed suit.  not blaming the employees, they are just a victim of the owner's neglect.  Avoid this place at all cost, spend your money where it's appreciated."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 20 times or so and I have to say this is one of my favorite \"townie\" bars! I absolutely love the food here! Two of my favorite are the tacos and the pierogies. In my opinion they have some of the best pierogies in Cleveland (and I have had my fair share)! The drinks are cheap and you can always get a good meal at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Ice House is home to my favorite chicken wings in the Cleveland area. The \"Wet 7 Pepper\" is more than words can describe. Highly recommended! Just the right about of spice and not over the top hot.

The bartenders working have all been there for several years and are very polite. 

Aside form the wings they have a large menu and I have never been disappointed in any selection.

A lot of TV's, Keno, Outdoor patio. 

They have all the bases covered here!


           ******TRY THE WET 7 PEPPER WINGS. TRUST ME!******"}
{"text":"Obviously their kitchen staff needs to be completely revamped. Ordered nachos as an appetiser and our food. Got our dinner 30 minutes later without a single visit from the bartender and the nachos 20 minutes after that. Throughout the stay the bar tender only came to us one time and the others were had to flag her down after 40 minutes between visits. I did find her at one point talking to someone and twirling her hair with 3 other patrons looking at her in an aggravated state with empty glasses. Food tastes OK so I gave two stars."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE.....sure is a great localy \"towny\" bar
Price: Cheap
Parking: Ample free parking
Food: FANTASTIC....try the fried bologne sandwich.
Service: Fast and friendly

THE SKINNY:  Get your ass here and try it out.  You cant beat the food, prices, service and location."}
{"text":"Typical towny bar, pretty friendly crowd. They have great wings (among other things) and we usually order take out for a lot of the browns games. The bar inside is fairly small and there isn't a whole lot of seating, even though there seems to be a lot of space that's not taken advantage of."}
{"text":"Drive past plenty of times came in one night before last call. Bartender made me feel so welcomed and told me about all the specials they have going on. Heard about wing Wednesday and oh my god! I am not disappointed! Best wings I had since moving here from Cali 8 months ago!!"}
{"text":"Homemade delicious food. Chips , pierogis, wings and shrimp is delicious. The place is pretty cool and the patio is awesome."}
{"text":"We come here for the wing special! They are consistently good and if you like greasy fried chick with awesome sauces this should be your weekday getaway. I always get the $2 electric lemonades and they recently added lime ritas, my other guilty pleasure. The ladies here are super friendly and have been here for years!"}
{"text":"The food was good as expected. Beer is nice and cold like it should be. The service was a bit pushy at first then it was lacking but came to a better speed of service, granted the Cavs are having a playoff game being shown."}
{"text":"Just a good go-to bar. During the summer the outdoor bar is pretty great. Just wish they had more seating. Fills up pretty quick."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with friends after work one evening. We got a spot out on the covered patio and it was really nice! Warm sunny day but we could still enjoy being outside with shade and a slight breeze coming through. I will say that were a lot of men here and it was slightly uncomfortable that all eyes are on you as you walk through the restaurant to get to the patio. Maybe it's more of a local's hang out or maybe it's been a long time since they last saw a woman. 

For food I tried a side of pierogies. You get two in an order for $4 and they are deep fried and covered in what seems like that liquid butter you put on your popcorn at the movie theater. Inside you'll see some American? Velveeta? cheese. Comes with onions and sour cream as well. I also tried one of their tacos for $2, they only have ground beef but you can choose mild or hot sauce and deep fried shell or regular shell. Add a $2.50 Modelo and it was a nice cheap greasy bar food dinner. 

It was pretty steady with patrons while we were there but the bartender was still friendly and did a good job, just had to be patient. All in all a good spot for a drink on the patio and for eating fried pierogies."}
{"text":"Wife and i ordered two club sandwiches took over 30 minutes and we asked the bartender to check on our food and we noticed that no one in the kitchen was wearing gloves. So we asked the bartender to please have the person that makes makes sandwiches to wear gloves. So then the bartender comes back and tells us she through our sandwiches away and gave us our money back. Then when we left we noticed that the kitchen continued to work without gloves. DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"A great neighborhood bar.  They also have a patio when weather permits.  Holly is the best bartender here and always smiling.  They have cheap drinks during Cavs, Browns and Tribe games.  Food specials vary daily.  One night they have 2 gyros for the price of one.  Kitchen stays open till late as well.  Big fan of this local place"}
{"text":"We love this place for wings .The garlic parmesan are the best ,beers are cold great waitress. It is very nice place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Some friends and I came here for some beer and late night food, all of our first times here. The inside is really nice, relaxing atmosphere. It wasn't too crowded, plenty of seating in booths (I think?) at the bar, high tops, and it appears they have a really nice patio for warmer days. The food was surprisingly really good! Servers were friendly and helpful. I can't wait to go back! The drink prices were also really great, and they had a nice selection. No complaints from anyone about this place. We all had a meal and two (tall) beers, nobody's bill was over 12 bucks. Perfect"}
{"text":"Awesome bar, with great drink prices. The decor consists of a series of blow molds along with local high school and sports memorabilia. The best part of this place though are their wings! The wings are very large, and flavorful. Not to mention you get a ton of them for pennies. Staff is very nice and attentive as well."}
{"text":"Come here once and a while to meet up with friends who live close.  One of the better bars in the area.  Cool Marilyn Monroe staue and stuff on the walls to look at.  Pretty good beer slection as far as domestics go but nothing too crazy.  They do carry GLBC and thats rad.  Bartenders have big hair and wear the same clothes as high school girls which makes for intresting people watching if your at the bar.   Food is always good and place usually is packed.  From what I hear they have daily food specials but they are not advertised anywhere that I have seen.  The place looses two stars because in this day and age a website is somewhat necessary to let customers know specials and events.  Usually the first thing I do when going out is check their site and then check Yelp..its how I roll.  Also, do not drink the darft beer.  I had one and the diacetyl taste was so bad even my beer lovin ass couldnt choke it down.  She was super cool about it and got me a new beer..in a bottle.  If your gonna have 20 tapps or so, cleaning them at least weekly is what ya gotta do.   So, tease up that hair, hit the tanning bed and throw on them tan Uggs and come on up!!"}
{"text":"Friendly servers, great specials, clean, outdoor patio- what more can you ask for? We had the best hot dog in town ($3.50), meatball sub and beer. All perfectly done and beer was cold. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"So I've always driven past this tavern but never thought about stopping in and I honestly don't know why!

My husband had the idea of coming here on a weekday to grab some dinner and a beer.  They have plenty of specials every day so make sure you check the board behind the bar!  

Coincidentally, my friends were actually at the bar as well finishing up their mussels, which were on special that day.  They highly recommended it to my husband and me, but we were craving burgers and sandwiches.

The husband ordered the French onion sandwich and I ordered the Philly cheese steak!  When they both came out, it looked like heavens gates opening up! The bread was so soft and hugged the meat so lovingly!  We both had a handful of meat in our sandwiches which made every bite enjoyable!  They were not shy with the amount of cheese they put on there too!! The sandwiches do not come with a side so we just ordered one side, which I'm glad we did because we were already getting full from the sandwich alone!

The service was great and very attentive!  She made sure we quenched our thirst for some booze while helping us decide on what to try for being first timers.  Would definitely come back here to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this bar because of its food and cheap drinks!!! Downfall... All of Parma's glory playing horrible music of the juke box. Sometimes ya just want to listen to the game and not \"Big Green Tractor\""}
{"text":"Was looking for a place, any place for a dive bar meal and place to watch the CWS. Glad I found this. After reading the other reviews this was my only real choice in the area. It was June 28, 2018 and I sat at the \"outdoor bar\" they have built into a breezeway between the main building and a storage building. It functions perfect as the slight breeze was perfect shelter from the heat and I never recalled any road noise. 

Started with a Yuengling draft from Jessica. The keg immediately ran out and rather than asking me to change my order or wait, she ran to the inside bar and got my pour without my expecting it. Menu and specials all looked great but I read about and asked Jessica if she would recommend the Wet 7 Pepper Wings and she let me know they were her fav. Ordered up and nobody was proven a liar. They were outstanding. Some of the best I've ever had.

My friendly neighbor had some great looking sliders and his wife had a \"big salad\". Every meal I saw plated looked great and the patron seemed to love it. I had a second beer (she ran inside again) before they changed the outdoor keg and finished with a mixed drink. 

It was popular inside and out. I couldn't recommend this place more highly if you are looking for the friendly neighborhood dive joint with nice staff and great food."}
{"text":"From the outside looking in u feel like u may get stabbed if you go into this place. But don't be too quick to judge. Surprisingly not that bad once inside. The patio area is nice. Younger crowd than I was expecting. I did not get any food so not rating on food. But the drinks were cheap. Bartender friendly and attentive/ fast."}
{"text":"Wings are great !! Staff is great !! Nice place to throw back a few cold ones and catch the game."}
{"text":"Ice House food is really good...they have a special on something every day of the week.  They have great wings that actually seem to be made as ordered - not just spun in sauce when you order them.  So that means they aren't like chicken-jerky.  
The mussels are awesome, and try a bowl of their chili.....
Drink specials during Indians and Browns games, and even non-specials prices are very, very reasonable.  Beer is always cold too!

Sometimes it's hard to get attention of the bar staff, but I don't really blame them, for a few reasons:

1.  The bar curves around a wall that blocks their view, esp. if they're washing the glassware.
2.  There's a lot of regulars (which is a good thing) that, as you'd expect, do get a little more attention than the casual attendee.
3.  The bartenders are all very attractive, so they get chatted up by regulars and randoms alike.  :D

Only other complaint, but I can't fault them for this too much - PARKING is tough a lot of wing nights."}
