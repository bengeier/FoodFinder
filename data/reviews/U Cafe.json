{"text":"I'd have to say from when I was young until now, my father's cooking is the best I have ever eaten.  

His dream has always been to display and ask everyone appreciate the talent and passion he has for food.  The experience, thought and technique my father uses is in all honesty prestigious.

I urge everyone to give the restaurant a try and write a review to help my father and his partner succeed.  I'm more than positive that you won't be disappointed in his food as I also have a sharp tongue myself."}
{"text":"Pros:
Easily accessible location (it's in one of the corners of the plaza, near TD Bank)
Spacious parking lot
Clean environment
Fast and friendly service
Delicious food
Affordable

Cons:
Confusing restaurant sign (The restaurant sign includes two separate Chinese names and one unnoticeable English name)

We ordered:
Beef noodle soup: Soup is very tasty, not just soy sauce saltiness. But you can taste the complex ingredients, spices, and the long hours of simmering. The beef is thinly sliced, very flavorful and tender. The beef tendon is melt-in-your-mouth soft! The noodle is medium width, soft but not loosing a bit of a bite.

Salty duck with rice (this duck has white skin; it is saltier in comparison to the soy duck, which is sweeter and has brownish skin): Sliced pieces of salty duck accompanied by two side dishes, which were vegetables and tofu. The duck was tender and flavorful. The skin was delicious without tasting too fattening.

Saut√©ed eggplants: Delicious! Soft and well seasoned. Not overly cooked with soy sauce.

Fried chicken thigh: flavorful. If you are like chicken thigh without too much crust but has all the tenderness and flavor, then this is the chicken thigh for you.

On the house condiment, pickled radish/apple/pear (can't make out what it was): the vinegar pickled radish/apple/pear was crisp and refreshing.

overall: GOOD FOOD. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem when I was in Canada.  I live in the San Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles, so Chinese food is a specialty.  And let me say I've been all over the world and very few places will hold a candle to the restaurants in my backyard.  This is one of them.  Ordered the beef noodle soup and the quality was top notch.  I'm coming back if I'm ever in town again."}
