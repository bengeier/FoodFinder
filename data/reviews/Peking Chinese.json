{"text":"I love this place, I know lots of people are saying the lady is rude, but she is always super busy and I just crack up, when I hear her being that way. some of her comments are hysterical. shes a hoot, just be nice to her and she will be nice back. you have to remember too,  sometimes if we don't understand another language they may sound harsh, sometimes she just talks really fast cause they are so busy, which is a sign the food is great. I have never been there when they weren't busy and I love all their food. this isn't a 4 star joint, that's like saying you are going to taco bell or fast food for the service, get over it. that is just her personality and I guess if you don't like it, don't eat there. id choose it anyday. try it"}
{"text":"We had a really horrible experience at Peking. Okay, so let me spell it out. We wanted to order take out food.  We wanted to get the spicy wonton, veg lo mein, schezwan chicken and ma po tofu. Me and my friend do not eat any meat other than chicken. So we called this place up, and a really rude woman picked up the phone. Courtesy was out the window. I asked her if the spicy wonton has meat.. and she said \"only cream cheese\". So I told her one order of that. I didn't know if she understood what I was saying, so I asked her again and she says \"pork yes\". I was like what the hell! So we took that off the menu, an ordered spring rolls instead. She kept talking to someone in the background all through the call, so I wanted to make sure that she got my order right.  I asked her, \"could you please repeat my order?\" For which she responded(or rather yelled) \"OH MY GOD! THAT WAS SUCH A SMALL ORDER BUT YoU STILL WANT ME TO REPEAT IT? ??? FINE!!!! ONE SpriNG ROLL, ONE LO MEIN, ONE CHICKEN ONE TOFU.. HAPPY??? \" and then she just slammed the phone down. Worst service ever! I was just petrified after the call! Never ever have I had anyone talk to me like that! The food arrived like half n hr from then.. and guess what! They got the order wrong! She gave me fried rice instead of lo mein! AND, we were supposed to get two free egg rolls/can of soda with a purchase of over 15 bucks.  They didn't give that to us either.  Never again am I gonna order from this place! Stay away please!"}
{"text":"Hmm all right.  So I was stuck inside having to work on a take home exam and I was craving Chinese food.    Pros: Very efficient.  I live in a zoo of an apartment complex and I am super impressed that someone arrived at my door lickity split.  REALLY impressed with the service.  Cons: The food.   I got some won ton soup, crab rangoons and beef and broccoli.  I was really impressed at how many of those noodle things were in the won top soup.  Normally when you get a small you have like one, maybe two of the noodle thingies.  But my little cup was jam packed with them.  Score!  The meat inside of them didn't taste all that great though.  I just took the meat out and ate the noodles.  (My dog enjoyed the meat filling!)  The crab rangoons (a fave of mine) were very meh.  I'm not really sure if the outside or the inside was the problem (or both), but I've definitely had better.  The beef and broccoli was also very uneventful and not super tasty.  So overall, I'm not entirely sure I'll order through them again.  If I do and I order something different and it is yummy I will be sure to write an update and adjust the rating accordingly.   At the very least, you can't go wrong with the service.  And maybe I just did a bad job in my food choices.  Maybe they're known for something else.  If you order from there and like what you got, make sure you write a review so I can try it next time! :)"}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese take out in Willoughby. Always very busy - they are to the point and very efficient. Don't expect small talk. Reminds me of take out places in NYC. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went to take a bite of my white rice and glanced down and saw a dead cockroach in my rice right before I almost put it in my mouth. I was completely disgusted and will never eat there again. My co-worker an I called back and they came back to bring us a refund. I sure hope they got an exterminator since then as this was 3 years ago."}
{"text":"If you want mediocre Chinese food and bad customer service (yes even for take out), this is your place.  Because it is convenient and take out, we tolerate the service. But after awhile it gets to be ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great delivery time, short wait time for pick up.  Food is always great and as ordered."}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese joint in Willoughby.  Chinese take-out isn't about customer service.  Recite your order to them clearly and concisely and they'll make it happen.  This place is fast and straight to the point.  Portions are hefty and inexpensive.  Don't bother dining-in, it's just not that kind of restaurant.!"}
{"text":"Great food. The woman who takes orders can be rude most of the time. We will always order from here though. Delivery is usually speedy."}
{"text":"Pour service but the food is actually great as Americanized Chinese food.  One of the good take out I've ever had. Much better than panda buffet."}
{"text":"I told myself when I moved here from Columbus last year that I would not write too many positive reviews on Yelp because the restaurants just get overcrowded, and it is hard to get served.  After seeing reviews of Peking Chinese and only a 3-Star rating, I have to say something.  I've spent more than a year in the Orient.  I love Oriental cuisine.  This is the best Carry-Out Chinese food I've had in years.  The one problem I've experienced is consistency.  I first ate here Saturday, and then reordered the same meal on Monday.  Saturday I felt like a glutton; Monday was just okay.  For those whining about customer service, it's a different culture for crying out loud.  I'll bet they know more English than you know Chinese.  Be respectful, and don't expect to be dealing with Auntie Em.    You want good Chinese food for a good price?  This is the place.  You want good customer service?  Go someplace where you can get a massage.  We'll both be happy."}
{"text":"Wow.  I have never done this!    I tried this place again.  Hey - I'm moving out tomorrow, why not give it another go?  I called, told the chick what I was ordering, and she said \"10 minutes\" and hung up.  I was still talking.  I was like, \"wait!\"  Wow.  That was crazy rude.  I was going to leave to pick up my food, but then I realized - wait a second.  I dont have to!  She didnt ask for a name, a number, anything!  I am not ordering from that place!  They are so rude!  I called another place and the chick that answered was so nice!  It was like night and day!  DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Ordered online, easy ordering and fast delivery! Our food was delicious, the pork fried rice is good, good dumplings and excellent sesame chicken, general chicken and sweet and sour chicken. Will be ordering again. Reason for 4 stars instead of five, the egg rolls are huge, but too much cabbage for us! Kids wouldn't eat them at all."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! HORRIBLE!! HORRIBLE!!  CUSTOMER SERVICE The employee who took my phone order took my credit card information and did not ask for my name yelled and hung the phone up on me I called back to make sure the information was correct provide my name and she scream \"why are you calling I said its ok\" and processed to hung the phone up on me again. I drove to the restaurant to cancel the order did not feel comfortable knowing she took my credit card information and was so nasty I thought my personal information could be exposed to the wrong person. I asked for her name she refused to give me anything told me to get out she is done never had a customer like me and started to talk to the rest of the staff about the situation. This form of customer service is ridiculous disrespectful and I don't understand how this could be fair to a customer in any shape or form."}
{"text":"Cheap, yummy, and they deliver! Yay! I went out on a limb by ordering from here and was pleasantly surprised. I almost exclusively get my Chinese food from Imperial Dragon in Mentor, buuuut I was feeling lazy and didn't want to put real pants on, so I ordered from the only Chinese place I knew would deliver to me. I got crab rangoon, eggs rolls, shrimp toast, shrimp lo mein, and pepper steak. The crab rangoon, eggs rolls, and pepper steak were what I expected (average). I was impressed by the shrimp lo mein! The shrimp was a nice size, tasted fresh, and didn't have that gross poop vein on them! Score! On the other hand, I will pass on the shrimp toast next time, it was subpar at best. I got all of that delivered for less than $20!!! That was the biggest winning point. I will be ordering from here again. :)"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I have ever had! Took one bite of the wonton soup and spit it in garbage! Barely got thru the sweet and sour chicken and hated the egg roll too! Will never order from here again!!!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese restaurant. Lots of food for the price. My son did not like the sesame chicken because it wasn't all white meat. Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"My family's go to take out place. I have been ordering from here for over a decade and the food always remains the same. Management has changed once during that time but even then, the food didn't change.   Whenever and whatever I order, it is always fast and hot. The staff is very friendly and I keep coming back here because even when I try other places, this place is always better."}
{"text":"Great Chinese Take out. Fast. On some of Friday night, call in the orders. They get pretty busy and for a while during the peak dinner time."}
{"text":"Been here twice. This place serves classic Chinese American cuisine at good price, as the lunch special is a tasty value which includes an entree with rice and a beverage of your choice! Front is usually staffed by a young lady who is polite and quite helpful. Four stars for the lunch portion and prices!"}
{"text":"I have ordered here many times, I have had a dozen different dishes, and all were very good. The rice is always fluffy and tasty, the meats always cooked right. They have forgotten my sweet and sour sauce a couple times or my drinks when ordering for delivery, so check your food immedietly. But still I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I ordered Wor sue Gai, and got a  pork dish???  When I called to complain, they yelled at me.  I wanted my money back, and they refused.  I love Chinese food, and I know how to order Wor sue Gai.  It's chicken. Not pork.  Take heed when you order from this place."}
