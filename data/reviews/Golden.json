{"text":"Everything here is made on site and is delicious. A pleasant, open space to relax, do work, and of course eat wonderful food. Great for lunch and/or coffee+dessert. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Enter Golden Caf√©, a new coffee slinger in Toronto's west end, uniquely placed just off the Dundas strip close to Roncesvalles that, while becoming known to area residents, is still somewhat of a sheltered pocket of post-industrial magic.   High loft style ceilings reveal original wood framing and pipe work, no less than five large skylights, exposed beams and pillars, original brick walls repainted in a lush reflective white, and communal seating featuring an oversize wood dining table, and a tan leather couch whose plush luxuriance would befit a George Clooney Cigar Aficionado shoot. Oh, and they have free wifi.  Their coffee is the best! They use the beans of Calgary based coffee roaster/aficionados Phil and Sebastian (espresso/Americano, $2.75; cappuccino, $3.50; latte, $4.25), and they offer a fine selection of loose leaf teas provided by Sloane ($2.50). All are available to stay or to go, with a unique touch for the sweet toothed coffee lover; raw maple sugar (and syrup) from boutique maple syrup product provider (and tenant of 35 Golden Ave.), Ninutik. In addition to a Major League coffee lineup, Golden has homemade, gourmet-level salads, pastries, frittatas, desserts, and a host of bottled preserves.   It's a new spot, a hidden gem and a coffee shop that is here to stay.  I surely hope so, because these girls are doing an amazing job!

{"text":"We have our office lunch brought in by golden every Friday, and they never disappoint!  Just fantastic stuff consistently..."}
{"text":"Absolutely brilliant. On Fridays we have lunch as a team, and the Golden Cafe has been so good it seems we've pretty much gone with them for most weeks. They are absolutely fantastic, and the food is just beautiful. This Friday it was pulled pork sandwiches, and the girls hit it out of the park. Incredibly juicy and flavourful pork, fried onions, salad and moist little cupcakes that just rocked. We've tried their chicken and it was fantastic. Same with the Thai food, Mac and Cheese (Honestly, you gotta try the mac and cheese) and everything else we've gotten.   I cannot recommend them enough, either for lunch, catering, a snack....just stop by and indulge."}
{"text":"Really good food and such nice people! To find Golden, you'll have to walk into the building and follow the signs for the cafe. The space is really nice and open, and it seems like a great place to sit and relax and/or do some work. I'll be back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"This is a really out of the way place. The cappuccino was decent. Not amazing but certainly not bad at all. The space is a nice relaxing lobby of an artsy building. The main clientele really are the people working in the building as the coffee shop occupies the intersection of all the offices. They're pretty much only open when the offices are open. I don't think they really intend for many outside customers to come by but it's a nice relaxing place if you do find it."}
{"text":"Wowie! What a spot! Great coffee! Great food! Great conversation! The banana brad is a must have. So is their salad of the day. Yowza!"}
{"text":"Place was excellent! Greeted kindly and super friendly.  Quiet and easy to get work done--definitely a hard to find location but worth it!  The apple butter was wow!  Had the gluten free cookie with Apple butter and. Cappuccino.  Definitely enjoyed my visit."}
