{"text":"I'm walking by Wetzel Pretzels with my grandson, he asked if he could have the small winnie wrapped, the kid only wants a bite of one so I asked if I could pay for an individual rather than buying a whole bag. The supervisor yells no samples ...I stated I was willing to pay for the little winnie I didn't ask for a sample, she stated for me to call corporate. ...great customer service! This is the reason why these places go out of business. I will not purchase anything from that store in San Tan Village AZ"}
{"text":"The kiosk near the food court is very poorly run. I have visited 3 times over the last 6 months, every time the teenage girls working are outright rude. Why is there not an adult to supervise? You have a huge profit margin, and a good product, and it all goes to hell because of your RUDE staff. You can't even get a please or a thank you, or a smile. They seem miserable. Shame on your corporate team for not fixing this problem earlier."}
{"text":"So naughty, but so good"}
{"text":"Went to this Wetzel's Pretzels located at San Tan Village because I had a couple of coupons for a buy one, get one and a free pretzel dip. Disappointing experience. Service was grumpy and was not engaging, and I did not feel welcome into the shop. I made my order and while going to bag my order, the cashier dropped my bag onto the floor and proceeded to pick up that same bag and use it for my pretzels and dip. When I arrived back at work to enjoy the food, I was surprised to find that my \"cheddar cheese sauce\" was a dark goldenrod colored substance that was crusty and smelled nothing like what I would expect. Will not go to this shop again."}
{"text":"Very yummy pretzel bites! I had to pull them in half because they were so big. They really fill the bag to the top with the bites, then put some on top and add extra cinnamon. I had the \"sinful cinnamon\" bites with frosting dip. Delicious! 

*Wetzel's Pretzels is at the end of the shopping center close the Macy's. It's in the square with the fountains. Park to the left."}
{"text":"Wetzel's Pretzel is a great place for a snack. 

Their pretzel flavors are interesting and I like them all with the except their Apple Cinnamon, which is over the top bitter. 

The PV Food Court is somewhat basic, with a lot of second tier fast food choices. The only real restaurant closed about eighteen months ago and the space is still empty.  

Wetzel's is located in the Food Court, near the Picture Show movie theater and the Carousel. They do a nice job and their major competitor Auntie Anne's, is located at the other end of the Mall near JC Penny's. 

We like this is a Mom 'n Pop operating, where the family is there managing the business. Good people! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I work in the office building attached to Fashion Square Mall.  Around 3:00pm everyday I hear a faint whisper above the hum of the AC and the tap tapping on the keyboards of surrounding coworkers.  Do you hear it too...it is the Wetzel's Pretzels Pretzel bites calling my name.  I put on my headphones and then I swear I catch a whiff of their buttery salty goodness. It is so hard to not race into the mall and grab a bag and completely ruin my dinner.

This place cranks out delicious and fresh pretzels in a variety of flavors and sizes.  They even have a hot dog wrapped in a pretzel, be still my heart.    They are not quite as good as my home state's Auntie Anne's but they are really great when you have a snack attack."}
{"text":"Epic Final! You just had one job....
Ordered Almond Crunch bites and the almonds seem to be missing. Except for maybe a light dusting, which one could only guess it's suppose to be almonds???? I debated on going back and complaining as the kid that gave them to us seem to wish he were anywhere else but there. 
But, I didn't. My mistake. 
One thing's for sure, for what they charge for the pretzels you'd think the manager/owners would take better pride in what's going out. I guess as long as the money comes in who cares what goes out.
BTW...we found the almonds. At the very bottom of the bag. I guess now they just dump the almonds at the bottom and then the pretzels on top. 
Thank you Wetzel's it was good while it lasted. Now it's time to move on."}
{"text":"Fun! I like all the pretzel options & lemonade choices. Good little stop before the movies so you can fill the void & not drain your wallet at the concession stand."}
{"text":"After a hard day of shopping at Fashion Square my heart yearns for a Wetzels Pretzel.  This place has never let me down and I have purchased one to many pretzels here, believe me.  In my experience the pretzels are always served warm, buttery, and with the perfect amount of salt.  They have all kinds of varieties of pretzels and sauces for your snack adventure."}
{"text":"These pretzels are a guilty pleasure once in awhile when I go to the mall-- yum!  Their lemonade is pretty disappointing though. Way too tart!"}
{"text":"PV Mall's food court needs updating, but that doesn't affect my opinion of Wetzel's.  

The employees are nice and very accomodating.  The pretzels are fresh each time I get there, 

I like the pretzel bits, cinnamon and salted, or the buttered salted pretzels. Oh-oh Now I'm starting to crave them! Frozen lemonade, please!

I also appreciate they support the Phoenix Mercury, our WNBA team.  Time for pretzels!

Thanks Wetzels!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this is the worse place I've ever been ! Over salted and asked for another and they did not want to exchange for another !"}
{"text":"Pros: I grew up on these hot, yeasty delicious pretzels. Every time I pass a wetzels I have to eat one. 

Cons: calories, buttery, carbs, long lines"}
{"text":"Love coming here for pretzels. Always fresh, warm, and soft. The staff is great. Especially Juliette. She is always pleasant, kind, and helpful. It's nice to visit a business with great customer service! Will definitely continue to come back and recommend."}
{"text":"Wetzels's Pretzels is definitely amazing and very crave-able. I am pretty boring when it comes to pretzels... I like them plain with salt. No dipping sauce or weird pizza flavors for me. Wetzel's offers delicious plain pretzels and bite size wetzel bits as well which are perfect for sharing! Also if all that salt leaves you feeling thirsty try their frozen lemonades. They have regular and cherry, but usually ask them to mix them for me. Snaking perfection!"}
{"text":"I LOVE WETZEL'S PRETZELS.  My husband and I will come to the mall specifically for Wetzel's and nothing else. We'll make up an excuse to go to the mall and then be all like, oh yeah, and let's get a pretzel while we are there. We always get the bitz and they are so soft and fluffy. Lately the ones on the bottom don't seem to get as much butter love as the ones on top, but that's what I save the pizza sauce for."}
{"text":"Extremely poor customer service, \"management\" with typical fast food worker \"i don't care\" attitude."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than a salted pretzel, jalapeno cheese sauce and a Dr. Pepper.  Am I right people?

I love Wetzel's so much, it's almost weird.  It's gotten so bad that I really can't leave the mall without one.  And when I came to Fashion Square the other day, I saw that this Wetzel's is even better than the PV mall one. They had more specialty pretzels, like jalapeno and cheddar cheese.  I went with the jalapeno one and it was pretty good.  Not as good as the classic salted though- I'll stick to that from now on.  

Trust me, next time you go on a shopping spree and get hungry, Wetzel's is the way to go."}
{"text":"I love Wetzel's Pretzels. And I can't imagine being friends with someone that doesn't. 
What's not to love really? The pretzels come in a plethora of flavors and you can get dipping sauce to go with them. I recommend the classic salted pretzel with the jalapeno cheese sauce. Not a meal you'd get every day, but the perfect treat for every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Grabbed a pretzel for myself and a bag of plain minis for my son and used my debit card, not paying attention when I check my bank statement I WAS CHARGED $14.75!  WTF?  That can't be right, can it?  I wasn't given a receipt so I can't check. I feel like I've been scammed. Two measly items and nearly $15?  I've been bamboozled."}
{"text":"They have their regular storefront on the third floor near Nordstrom's. They also have kiosk/cart located in the food court. The pretzels are tasty and served warm. Can't go wrong with this perfect afternoon snack. My favorite is the almond crunch."}
