{"text":"In all of the times I've driven up and down Northfield Road, I've never thought to stop at Speedy's Grub Shack.  However, we noticed it once while scrolling through the options on SkipTheDishes and decided to be adventurous.  This turned out to be a solid, and economical, choice.

For $10.99, you can have ten jumbo chicken tenders.  For a dollar more, you can add spicy Speedy Sauce.  The best part is that these are probably the best chicken tenders I've ever had.  The portion size is huge, so we were eating them for days-- they heat up well in the oven, but they're pretty good sliced cold and tossed over a salad, too.  I've also had the garden salad, which isn't fancy, but is fresh with nice crispy lettuce and generously portioned.  The steak philly sandwiches were good, but not as awesome as the chicken.  My husband said the red velvet cake was good, too.

This isn't fine dining, but if you're looking for big portions of cheap, good food (that can get delivered to your house until 11 PM!), it's a good place to check out."}
