{"text":"Beer selection is great.  Food was absolutely awful!  Slow service (only three tables occupied in the entire place)."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Sunday and it was practically empty. We waited 15 mins after being seated for someone to come to our table then was told someone else would be coming soon. Beerhead next door is much better service and you can bring in or order in your own food."}
{"text":"worst service ever....called and order in at 1245..im still waiting for my order almost 45min later. never again"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I had service this bad. We stopped in for drinks and appetizers. Our waitress completely disappeared. When we finally got someone to get her, she walked by and slapped the check down without asking if we wanted anything else. 

The appetizer we ordered only came with enough chips for about half of it and we asked for more as we paid the bill. Apparently asking for more chips gets you an additional $4 on your check. I won't be back, and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere. Not worth the time, effort, or money."}
{"text":"We stopped here before attending an event at Heinz Field because the menu looked promising and the location was convenient. The server was pleasant, but service was extremely slow and the restaurant was not at all busy. The drinks took over 15 minutes to be served, and I never received a water I'd asked for. At one point, we were finally told that \"our food was ready,\" but it was not served for nearly 10 minutes after that. The appetizers were delivered with our entrees instead of as appetizers and by that time, they were cold. At one point, I ordered the same beer as another guest, but mine was at least 3 shades darker than his and tasted much different - definitely not the same beer. We asked for the check as soon as the meal was delivered because it had been difficult to track down our server. The food was decent, but due to the service we experienced, I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive (the only positive): the appetizer was awesome. I would definitely recommend the pierogies with kielbasa and caramelized onions.

Negative: pretty inattentive waitress. We ordered, got the drinks fast, and that was about it. The appetizer took forever to come and so did the food. When the food did come, I asked for ranch and never received it. I couldn't even ask again because our waitress didn't check on us until she brought the bill. I got the California Chicken Club. Bacon was only on one half of the sandwich, the bread was soggy, and the chicken was kind of tough. 
My boyfriend ordered a burger that he said was only okay at best. 
Next, our waters weren't refilled until after the bill, cause like I said, she only came to check on us once she asked if we were done.

Once she brought the bill, it took her 10-15 more minutes to come pick up the debit card. Then another 5-7 minutes to get our own debit card back to us.
I'm not one to complain much cause I used to be a waitress too and understand how it can be, but I felt this review was necessary since the food and service was not good. 

Probably wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Food is awful. I went with my family and we had the bbq chicken, steak, and burger. Hardly edible, the bread was old and stale. The meat was over cooked. Can't really say anything positive about this place except it will probably close soon due to how bad the food is."}
{"text":"Work nearby and went for lunch with colleagues.  Coffee was cold, burger was cold and only 4 onion rings. My colleagues ordered the brisket and were later told that they were out (this was at 11:45 AM). After placing new orders, they were the informed that they did in fact have brisket.   Service was fine."}
{"text":"Came from out of town and stopped here before a baseball game. The Food and and service (Rachel) were great!"}
{"text":"Horrible under pours (we are bartenders on vacation, we know how to count). Pretzels are like styrofoam, the cheese sauce was the consistency of play dough. The sausage and onions that came with the perogies were great, but the actual perogies may as well have come out of the frozen isle at the grocery."}
{"text":"Did not seem overly busy when we walked in but took over five minutes for a waiter or hostess to even acknowledge the line at the door and get us a table (there were no employees anywhere to be found).  When we finally did get a table, the chairs were wobbly and the waiter brought out plastic cups of water that looked like they had been been refused as there was residual brown liquid all over the rims.  Went to use the bathroom and it was horribly dirty.  We ended up walking a few blocks down the street to a different place as our experience was already bad and the Yelp reviews didn't make us want to stay.  Bummed as the menu looked good."}
{"text":"Great first visit to Local Brewhouse (LB)!  Before LB there was BZ bar and then before that - Firewater's I think?  I hope LB sticks around because its perfect fit for the location and Pittsburgh/Yinzers of course!   The menu contains plenty of \"Pittsburgh\" personality and is quite extensive. I love the names of some of the burgers \"Three Rivers Stadium\" and \"The Steelworker\".  Very clever!~ 

Parking:   Off street parking is available nearby definitely within walking distance but tough to find.  The lots around PNC are pricey.  Just a few blocks away (short walk) I parked at the General Robinson Street Garage and it was only $4.00!   The duration of my visit was over an hour too.  

 Ok let's talk about the food! 

Spinach Artichoke Dip:  I was skeptical about the tip by the appearance of it.. it looks as if it was dip I would have made at home in my microwave and it was all cheese.  It was ok; you can taste the spinach and artichokes, cheese and plenty of butter.  

Wings:  I really liked the selection of the wings offered.  It's refreshing to see new flavors and not the same old standard boring flavors such like bbq, garlic parm etc. 
Flavors on the menu:  Spicy Sriracha, Mango Habanero, Spicy Thai, Spicy Parm etc.  There are a dozen of flavors to choose from and even some rubs too! I decided to try the \"spicy parm\" since its one of my favorite blends and they exceeded my expectations.  My friend Jennie even liked the wings - and she doesn't usually like spicy food.  I have found that \"spicy\" is often labeled as \"hot\" and that is not the case.  

Aidan Steak Sandwich:  Steak, prosciutto wrapped asparagus, blue cheese, and spring mix on ciabatta bread.  Sandwiches come with \"homemade\" chips, but I prefer Fries and there was no substitution, so I had to pay extra for fries.   The fries were interesting, thick square cut and very tasty. 

Atmosphere: Modern with a rustic feel.  The bar is spacious and so is the dining area.  Restrooms are located in the basement and were clean.   

Service: 
It was good. The food didn't take long to arrive and we received our check right after asking for it.  The prices are slightly above average but because of the location that is to be expected. 
It was a TERRIFIC first visit and looking forward to heading back and trying one of their burgers.  

Thanks Local Brewhouse!"}
{"text":"It was a great spot for lunch! I enjoyed the Turkey, bacon, and avocado wrap. So, so fresh! It was exactly what I had been looking for. It came with fresh chips that were awesome. I really enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I do not like to leave negative reviews, even if the food was semi okay; however, the service here is next level atrocious.  It took almost two hours for 1 round of drinks, 1 appetizer and two burgers at noon on a Saturday.  The place was no where close to 25% capacity & plenty of tables & bar seats were unmanned.  Wait staff had absolutely zero interest in providing any expediency or adequate level of service but did manage to desperately apologize for these lackluster efforts upon delivering us our bill.  The men's room was also flooded w water which really put the finishing touch on this awful experience and seemed to really emphasize the mismanagement going on at this location.  If the owner gets it together, this place has a ton of potential.  Pirogies & sausages were very good."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They maybe had three tables and 5 people at the bar so they weren't particularly busy. Walked in tonight, came to the empty host stand, waited for a few minutes while the servers and the manager walked right past us without so much as a hello. We were sat at a table were we sat for up to 15 minutes without being greeted or served. Finally got served. Drinks went empty without anyone checking on us. Finally when we were ready to leave we flagged down our serve who just looked at us and didn't even acknowledging us. Finally got the other server to at least get our checks. All while the manager was just hanging around the bar. Also, a very aggressive man was jumping around the restaurant and yelling excessively loudly. It was quite the uncomfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"Well our out of town visit to the Local Brewhouse started good but ended horribly. We had some beers. Not a bad selection here. We weren't sure of the food so we decided to test the pretzel. It was incredible. So, we ordered the pot roast nachos at the recommendation of the bartender, along with a flatbread. Within minutes a waitress asked if ordered nachos with a sandwich. We told her no we ordered a flatbread with nachos. So, she set them both on the far end of the bar. Ten minutes later, the same server came back out of the kitchen, retrieved those old nachos, and served them to us stating that they were made in error but they would give them to us since it's what we ordered. WTF? Great. We didn't want to complain. Just nachos. But, they were cold and gotten nasty. Then came out the flatbread. Forgetting the 8 inch hair on top, we ate one little piece and said forget it. It was gross. This place should not serve old food to customers. This place should not serve flatbread AT ALL."}
{"text":"Not great, man. Not great.

There for lunch. Rather empty at 1pm; still took awhile to get food. Server was very pleasant and attentive.

French onion soup -- fairly certain this was just gravy, slightly (very slightly) watered down, with beef chunks thrown in. Thickest, and possibly saltiest, french onion I've ever had.

Margherita flatbread -- cold, no browning on the cheese (I mention this because the menu actually explicitly states \"golden brown\", haha), stale \"bread\".  Really gave the impression of bad frozen pizza that had been freezer-burned. Bad bad bad.

Fresh Homemade Seasoned Chips -- Salt-fest '17. Also painfully obvious that the oil used to cook these in wasn't hot enough (saturated in grease). Nope.

Beer list was rather underwhelming for something called \"Local Brewhouse\". But hey, beer.

Won't be back. Better beer next door, better food too easy to find elsewhere."}
{"text":"I would say I loved the food...... until I walked downstairs to the bathroom, it was one of the most deplorable conditions I have ever seen. If you can't clean your bathroom which people see, I can't imagine your kitchen!!!! Every toilet was filled with urine to the point that each one needs plunged. There was not a shred of toilet paper available, the only thing I am thankful for is that there was paper towels. I immediately told the waitress and asked to speak to a manager. He refused to come over. If you are planning on eating in the north shore please go elsewhere, I'm beyond horrified by what I saw. I wish zero stars was an option!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here with the intention of having a few drinks before doing the Party Pedaler. It wasn't super crowded even though Picklesburgh was going on at the bridge. There were around 10 of us. We got a table by the door that fit most of us, and the rest stood around. The service was just all right. We all got drinks, but there was no chance for any of us to get second drinks. We were there around an hour and 15 minutes. With how slow service seemed, about 20 minutes before we wanted to leave, we made sure to grab the check since we thought it might be a while before we saw the waitress again. They did have some good craft beer options and I loved that they had Arsenal ciders.

If you want a place to grab a drink before a baseball game, this is a good location, but it's slow. I don't think I'd go back, but it wasn't bad. So, if you have a lot of time and want to grab a cheap drink, check it out."}
{"text":"only got take out and got a grilled cheese. take the brie off the grilled cheese!! i love brie but it doesnt belong there. none of the cheese went together and it tasted like dish water. and the cheese to bread ratio was just awful. like they had five cheeses on there, yet there was still barely any and the bread was so thick and hard. never had a grilled cheese i didnt like till i ate this abomination. slap some cheddar on some Italian bread and call it a day. stop trying to make grilled cheese fancy and just make it good."}
{"text":"Just ok. Our server was really nice. He mentioned at the beginning he was new so I was especially impressed that the service was very smooth. 

We only had water to drink so I can't comment on the drinks, though it looks like they had a good selection. 

We shared a number of appetizers including the pretzel duo, the buffalo chicken dip, the pot roast nachos and side orders of fries. The fries were like thick cut steak fries and were good when they were hot but quickly got soggy with grease. 

The pot roast nachos were just ok. I think they would have been better served hot but when they came out they were totally cold. Not sure if they were meant to be served cold. The taste was still good but I would have preferred them hot. The buffalo chicken dip was the best item, a generous portion served hot and just the right amount of spiciness and creaminess. 

Probably would come back to drink but wouldn't seek this place out to eat again."}
{"text":"Friends and I went during our lunchtime from work. The service was really good and quick. I had the fried chicken sandwich with the chips. The chips were fried too done, almost burnt but the chicken sandwich more than made up for it. My friend stated that the Greek Salad was very good."}
{"text":"Great casual environment and great beer selection.  Great add to the North Shore.  Can't wait for the pirates season to start in April."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the naming is off. They call themselves local and say they support local, but out of all of their taps they have TWO listed as local. Arsenal (which is a cider made in Lawrenceville - local) and Fat Heads (Which is made in Ohio - not local). So in reality, they have one dedicated local tap. You could throw I.C. Light on there and make it two, but it's still wrong to call the place Local Brewhouse if you really don't have local brews. Pittsburgh is a great craft beer scene with a bunch of really good local beers. If you are looking for local go next door to Beerhead or across the river to Proper Brick Oven Pizza."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place. I was very disappointed when BZ spontaneously shut its doors but this place is even better. Great drinks, great food great service"}
{"text":"I like this place because it had a great selection of beers and better quality bar appetizers.  I hate the parking during games but all in all its a great spot."}
{"text":"Even on a Friday night on Halloween weekend, it's pretty calm and grabbing a beer is pleasant. While you're sipping, look around and pay attention to all the aesthetics, most of it is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre bar. I've had wonderful service at times and awful service at other times. The food has consistently been okay. Nothing great, nothing terrible. One piece of advice, make sure to specify what type of vodka you want, otherwise the bartender will use the expensive stuff (bigger bar tab = bigger tip for them)."}
{"text":"Something lacking in my dining experience...

I think that the Local brewhouse is confused that this location is on Federal Street (on a non game day/ baseball season) not Carson Street.  I am not sure why at 6 pm in Friday night, music is blasting and I can't hear my own voice.  Maybe i am too old for the \"clubbin\" scene, but I thought that 6 pm was a little early for \"Country Grammar\" by Nelly to be the background music.  And as I glanced around, it seemed like the demographic (skewing a little older) thought the same.  

Food was average, service was average.  

At one point, at about 7:30, i looked over to the server station and every one of the 5 servers were on their phones, one was even just sitting at the bar.  I get the new generation and love of technology, but at least try to hide it from the customers.  It just reads \"I will get to you when I am done checking my social media\".  At least look busy, or look like you are doing some thing restaurant related.   it is a pet peeve of my mine that creates a lazy aesthetic."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Ballpark scene. Features a wonderful selection of craft beers. The appetizers are remarkably good, we were particularly impressed by the soft pretzels. 

Our service was excellent. The Beer Market next door is very popular, but does not have food, so I imagine this place will be quite successful. It was packed on a Monday night with no baseball game. 

Great happy hour specials on food and drink."}
{"text":"This restaurant is horrible. We waited for our server for 10 minutes, ordered drinks which took at least at least another 15 minutes to come. When our server came to deliver our drinks, she didn't have one for me because she said they ran out of Miller Lite. What kind of restaurant runs out of Miller Lite on a Friday afternoon at 5pm? Unacceptable. Then I ordered a different beer.  We waited for another 20 minutes and I never got my drink so we decided to leave. So disappointed. The atmosphere was not great - sort of dirty and there was an air conditioning vent leaking right above our table. They need to start by hiring more servers and go from there. Will never go back here."}
{"text":"Just went in. Sat at the bar. The buffalo wings (mild) were good.

But i was given the check before my food even arrived. The gentleman next to me got his check after he was done with his meal, and when he asked for it

Also, the server asked if i really wanted carrots/celery with the wings, \"because she wouldn't want to waste food\" - that was my first time being offered less food at a restaurant"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! We were hesitant because it did not get good reviews but I'm glad we gave it a shot.

The Buffalo Chicken Dip is so good and our waitress was SO GOOD. 

Highly recommend if you are looking for food and drinks in downtown Pitt!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, very nice service. I was very pleased! Only one vegan menu item, which was a bummer! Also; back half of restaurant doesn't have the nicest view! Try to sit in the front if possible."}
{"text":"Third time eating here and I'm done! I want to like it so much, but it's just bad!! I ordered soup and a flatbread. My friends ordered hummus and chicken bites. Took almost 30 minutes. Ridiculous. And my soup came with the flat bread - why not first?! And everything was just luke warm. I guess sitting for 30 minutes waiting to be delivered cools things down a bit. And the flat bread wasn't fully cooked. Ugh. Just bad bad!!! It's been bad all 3 times!!! I kept hoping it was just a fluke and would be better. It's not a fluke. It's just bad. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Worse lunch place on the North shore   Asked which sides we wanted and then charged $7.50 .  They were so bad we threw them out.   Still looking for the avocado in my turkey avocado sandwich.  Never again"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for lunch. There was plenty of seating and we sat away from the door since it was cold. I ordered the caprese salad, and the other meals were the southwest salad, traditional brisket sandwich with chips, and the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. 

We didn't wait long for our order, and everything came out as expected. The caprese salad comes with an apple vinaigrette that is amazing! There is chicken salad on it as well which tasted like it was a honey mustard based chicken salad. It was very tasty. The tomatoes and mozzarella were very fresh."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza flat bread. The bread was not great, cheese wasn't even browned. Toppings were ok. Wait staff was very inattentive, and it wasn't even remotely busy. My girlfriend got whatever the vegetarian sandwich was and it was really oily. Wish we had kept walking."}
{"text":"Previously the awkward BZ Bar, Local Brewhouse is much more accommodating to the sports crowd here in Pittsburgh. Here you'll find typical bar fare with exceptional burgers and sandwiches that will surely satisfy your appetite. My husband and I watch Pirates and Pens games here often. His favorite indulgences are the Stella Artois battered pickle chips and any of the burgers. You'll find monster burgers such as the Steelworker, which boasts 4 cheese Mac n cheese sandwiched between two 1/4 pound patties, wrapped in bacon, deep fried in cider batter, topped with queso and jalapeño relish. Yup. That's the level of burger we're talking about here. Bring your appetite and your Pittsburgh spirit to this joint!

Also, they have a decent numerous of beers on tap, a good bottle list, and a surprisingly decent wine by the bottle list (for a sports bar). They are generally lacking in the wines by the glass, though.

They lost a star for me due to lack of general food allergy options and wines by the glass. Still, that's small potatoes for the usual clientele. Come and enjoy the new Local Brewhouse!"}
{"text":"I'd say this place is your standard bar. Went here on a Friday and sat outside, we had a dog. Our waitress was great, very quick and continually checking in on us. They have a pretty good draft selection. We didn't try any of the food but the menu looked pretty good. Right across the street from PNC Park, I'd imagine this place gets pretty busy during Pirates games."}
{"text":"Ate here with family, portions were small for the price. We had the Rueben and the meat was thick and tough. Caprese salad looked great had lots of cheese, but greens and tomatoes were light on the plate. I would recommend onion rings as your side. Beer selection is good, so a great place to stop for a drink."}
{"text":"I stopped in here right before the baseball game to get some drinks and appetizers. The beer menu was pretty good, I tried a bunch of the different and local beers, I wasn't disappointed. After a couple of rounds i decided to go in for the app. 

The wings were excellent. The Local Lickr and the Caribbean Jerk wings were both very flavorful and delicious. Service was also very good.

One thing that I would recommend is to turn up the Juke Box. I put in $5 and had to really try hard to hear the songs I paid for."}
{"text":"My wife and I grabbed lunch here on a slow afternoon. It has a cool atmosphere and a nice location. It was a pretty nice day so the garage doors at the front of the restaurant were open. I had The Douglas sandwich with sweet potato fries and my wife had the Turkey Avocado BLT Wrap with chips. We both enjoyed our food and it came in a relatively timely manner. I didn't find out that the sweet potato fries had an up charge until I got the bill though. It took a pretty long time to get the check once we were finished but overall service was average and it was a nice experience. On another note, it is rather misleading to have Brewhouse in the name because no beers are brewed there and it isn't a brewery or brewpub."}
{"text":"Food was good, a little pricey but for being right across from PNC Park you can't really expect much else. The service was just meh. I arrived well before any sort of rush before the Pirates game and was treated fine enough but once it began to start picking up I could feel myself being rushed out. Not the greatest experience to feel rushed out but it was a one time stop. Might be worth a stop on a non-event day but not sure I'd come back."}
{"text":"They had out of season beers, that were not fresh. The pierogis were delicious and come served with Kielbasa and onions. The chicken sandwich was very dry, and the salad was ok and served with fries. Hopefully the place is better in baseball season."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, it took very long to get service. Whatever you do, DO NOT eat the watermelon cole slaw, it literally tastes like garbage truck juice.... for real. The sweet potato fries however are VERY good!"}
{"text":"Came here before class for a quick bite and it happened to be Wednesday so I got the $0.60 wings. Jamaican Jerk rub was delicious and the wings were crispy. Great wings especially for 60 cents. It was a nice day so they had the large patio doors/windows open which was nice. The bartender Justin was friendly, and attentive."}
{"text":"This is where I go before Steeler games.  I can't vouch for all the food, but I CAN say that when I first perused the menu looking for something that said, \"Steelers Victory\" the Pittsburgh Pretzel stood out.

It is a pierogie, sauerkraut and kielbasa sandwich on a pretzel bun.  It is Pittsburgh on a pretzel bun.  It is victory.  I'm not saying it's a lock, but I am saying that I've eaten that sandwich the last three consecutive home games...win, win, and win.  

I didn't experience slow service despite it being gameday with a packed house.  Maybe I just got lucky.  But the service was good, the Pittsburgh Pretzel was good, and their beer offering was good.  Nice atmosphere and great location for the game makes this place my go to for prefunctioning.  

Get there early on game day, or expect a 20-30 minute wait."}
{"text":"This has happened on more than one occasion. We waited for more than ten minutes to get any kind of service in this place. The first experience was about four months back and last night was the second time. It got so frustrating that we just walked out of the place and went to beer head instead."}
{"text":"Service is EVERYTHING. Hello? Is anyone there? Are u listening? The only thing keeping Local open is the location. So I guess location is everything.....sigh...

Guys, please listen. If you don't step up and get a good kitchen manager this place will be closed in a year. The lunch staff is so slow. You need to realize that we ALL have to go back to work! 

I can't even bother to review the food."}
{"text":"We live about 2 blocks from Local Brewhouse.  We often stop in on game days as well as non game days.  Their food is pretty good overall but on multiple occasions we have tried to order 3-4 different things and they were out of multiple items.  This happened to the point that we walk out... multiple times.  Definitely better options on the north shore for drinks and food."}
{"text":"The food was decent. Nothing to great to write home about. The beer was also good. The location is what makes this place so much fun. 

Right next to PNC great pre game spot and the food is better then inside the stadium. They have a decent selection on tap and alot of tvs!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here last Saturday for a quick couple of beers. The service was quick and friendly. There were only 4 other tables and a handful of people at the bar. This was about 2 in the afternoon, so that probably helped.

I only had a beer (or two but who's counting) so I can't talk about the food. I liked the fact the the front opens up to the street. The weather was perfect so that's where we sat. It's a great place to hang out and have a few drinks and just relax, although I would imagine it's gets packed during Steelers and Pirates games though. I will be be back!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed to say the least. After coming in and waiting to be seated I talked to three staff members one telling me that they were not serving food the other two saying yes so my group and I sat down waited 15 min just to get a server , when she finally came it took 15 more min to get our drinks , everyone around me was complaining about there service as well so against my better judgement I we ordered our food, after another 45 min and not able to order another drink during that time . I will not be returning there are many other places on the births hire to eat and this will not be one."}
{"text":"Came from Calif. for Giants-Pirates game and stopped in for lunch.....absolutely amazing food and our server was soo nice and attentive....this was a home run lunch!"}
{"text":"Usually go in on mondays for lunch. The service to get food is always slow, you know that walking in. But yesterday the customer service was awful. The bartender had a poor attitude. When she brought my food never gave me a spoon for my chili has to ask and no napkins. Never came by ask how the food was nor ask if I needed anything else to drink. Awful."}
{"text":"Walked in and out of here after no one even gave me and my buddy a look. Horrible service. We won't return."}
{"text":"Horrible! I went with my boyfriend and we waited for 15 minutes for our table to be acknowledged. The waitress handed us two different menus that had completely different food on them. I wanted their Cuban sandwich, which was from the correct menu, and was told they never have that item. So I ended up just ordering the same meal as my boyfriend. We ordered barbecue bacon cheeseburgers, weren't asked how we wanted them cooked and they arrived about 45 minutes after ordering. Upon arriving, they did not come with bacon or barbecue. When we told the waitress about the missing ingredients (she had to ask us what was supposed to come on the burger after we told her the name of the burger), she said that she would just bring the ingredients on the side. So once we assembled our burgers, we were pretty over it. If it were during a game or a large concert, I would totally give some leniency in the situation. But this was not a busy night. Speaking of games, the Pens game was going on across town and wasn't even playing on the tv. We definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER! Trust me stay away! If I could give them 0 stars I would! Not only was the food bad and expensive but the service sucks too!"}
{"text":"Was there Sunday after the regatta & all I can say is disappointed. It wasn't busy & the wait staff was never around. There were A LOT of things out that night, which I understand but the server could care less. I ordered Cajun wings & then smoked wings... I received the Cajun, but the \"smoked\" wings were plain fried wings. When I told the server she looked at me as if I was wrong. I know the difference between fried & smoked. There was 3 of us only 2 sets of silverware, so I had to share a napkin. I've worked in restaurants & things happen. But come on, at least act like you care. I'm a 20% tipper but left 10%. Your $14tip turned into $7"}
{"text":"Yuck. Disinterested bartender. Actually sat at the bar and ate soup while patrons glasses went unfilled. Then coughed in her hand and got up and poured an unsuspecting customer a beer. YUM!  
Food was awful. Cheesesteak on a hot dog bun. Couldn't find the peppers or onion that was supposed to be on it. Meat tasted freezer burned... wife's salad was good as was the soup. There are so many better places in the Burgh to eat. How this place stays open is beyond me... Try Southern Tier, the Foundry, hell Tequila Cowboy has better food."}
{"text":"We were recommended to go to this place as we were walking to the Pirates game by a random townie and decided to skip Burgatory and try this place out. Wrong move. 

I ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich and it had no flavor whatsoever. I was a little hesitant seeing that it had a spicy aioli, but welcomed the challenge of a new taste. Didn't taste any spice at all. The chicken was bland as well.

Also, the tap water here is disgusting. Spend the couple extra bucks and get a soda.

Our waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Once before a game for beer and second for lunch. The food is not good. We had 2 burgers one was regular burger and it was so dry and meat was so tough it was not worth $10. The other one was deep fried but had no bun, very odd and not described in menu. Not worth $12. I'll go back only before a game but never for food."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in here for happy hour one day before a Yelp event that was nearby. As we checked in we saw the low star reviews and now that I've experienced it I can see why. My friend went with the pretzel appetizer and she said she wasn't very impressed with it. After much debating I went with the Buffalo chicken dip because you can't really go wrong with Buffalo chicken dip right? The dip came out with puddles of grease and oil on the top. Not just little spots but actual puddles. Right off the bat I was pretty hesitant to eat a lot of it with the amount of oil I could already see. Thankfully appetizers were half off for happy hour so it was only $4 but I would never pay the full price for something like that. If you looking for a spot to grab drinks on the north shore i would recommend it but I recommend you stay clear of the food."}
{"text":"I guess I don't understand the hate here. We popped in for a light snack on a Saturday that the Pirates weren't in town. It was moderately busy but we decided to sit at the bar. It was a warmer day and a Corona sounded good, however, they had a decent craft beer selection and full bar. The only thing that I thought was off was that we asked for limes and the bartender had one left. It was only 1pm, so I wasn't sure if they were going to get more or the bartender was just too lazy to cut a fresh one. That really annoyed me. Other than that we had great service.
We ordered the spinach dip with Pita. It was really good. The couple next to us got sandwiches that looked delicious and they seemed to enjoy.
I can see why some people would complain about slow service as this is directly across the street from PNC Park, so I'm sure it gets insane when there is a home game. I always take these complaints with a grain of salt b/c the restaurants get so slammed and the staff tries their best to keep up with the craziness. 
I will definitely be back to check out more of their menu options."}
{"text":"This is a bar near stadiums so was not expecting much. Decent beer list. Can get any wine by the glass and a nice selection! Menu looked decent, but had a limited menu day we were here. We did get buffalo dip and fries. The dip was good, could taste more than just buffalo spice. Nice kick to it. The staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Came from CA,  I'm really picky when it comes to long islands. Bailey did great! I'm glad she was around.  Hope to be back next year for another Steeler game."}
{"text":"Dear Local Brewhouse,
       Here is why you suck. I made a reservation 2 weeks ago for 20. And you lost it. FYI it was not busy in the restaurant..... You can't bring food for 14 out in an hour an a half, and you comped me for my food that I never got..... Thanks for not charging me for the food I didn't receive.... I went to Spoonwood brewery and got my food and beer in 16 minutes. Thanks even though the food at your establishment good(this is why I picked this venue for my birthday) , I hope you close soon...there are way better places that don't waste your time..."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a snack and drinks on a non-game day and everything was great.

We had some delicious wings - bigger sized than you get at most sports bars these days - along with some soft pretzels with good dipping sauces.

All of this paired with super nice bartenders left us surprised with its current Yelp rating."}
{"text":"I always walk past this place and finally decided to wander in as it looks pretty cool. The drinks are awesome. They're happy hour menu is reasonably priced and the staff were very friendly. I think this place is popular because of the location but I'm most certain that it's not the Buffalo chicken dip or the chicken nachos that keeps these guys in business. The Buffalo chicken dip was the most interesting thing I've ever seen as it was very oily and it was very hard to find any chicken. The cocktails on the other hand were yummy. I enjoyed this special Girls Night Out made with Firefly Spiked Tea and it was delicious. This is more of a place you end up at not somewhere you plan to go."}
{"text":"We were seated by the hostess and nobody came to serve us. We asked the bartender if there was someone to help us and she didn't seem to interested. After 10 minutes we left. What a shame."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I had instant service, my drinks and food got to me in no time! Wonderful atmosphere w great music & tvs every where for when sports are on! Their beer is phenomenal! And the best part of all, it's not pricey! I highly recommend giving this place a chance if you haven't already ready!"}
{"text":"Went on a very quiet Monday. We were one of the only ones in the restaurant, and we got seated by the door. Our server came around and we ordered our drinks. After that she came and took our food order, we got the Monday special - $5 burger and fries. Then we saw her sitting a few tables over on her phone. We waited longer than we should've on a slow night and she was still sitting there. I told my husband, \"I bet our food is sitting in the back and when she goes to check on it, it'll be out.\" Sure enough, when she finally went back to the kitchen, she brought our order out. The temperature was luke-warm. The food was fine, the specials are pretty cheap, but the service was very sub-par. If you're going to be on your phone, at least go to the back or something to do it, not right in front of the customers. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I was served a Guinness Stout when I asked for a Breckenridge Porter. Somebody doesn't know how to hook up a tap."}
{"text":"I will have to visit this place at some point and dine in to update my review, but for now...I can review the food. We were next door at the Beerhead bar and ordered food from Local Brewhouse.  I get more and more excited every time the Amp'd group opens up a new restaurant because they never seem to disappoint.  They are very good at providing good food and a fun atmosphere in whatever they venture to do and Local Brewhouse is no exception.  We were ordering during game 5 of the stanley cup finals and during an intermission, so I imagine there was a lot of food orders being put in.  Fortunately, the wait for our food was only about 20-30 minutes, and everyone enjoyed what they got.  Their sweet potato fries might be a little bit too sweet though, and I was disappointed they didn't have a menu item for loaded fries.  Luckily, nobody had anything bad to say about their food and it came quick considering the event and environment of the evening."}
{"text":"Glass in the appetizer!

We had a pretty bad experience at the Brewhouse.  

Good location, we went before visiting the Andy Warhol Museum.  Our waiter was nice but pretty incompetent.  Gave us the wrong appetizer, my salad was a totally different one, and when the correct one came it had a diff lettuce than the one he told us it had, and my husband had to ask 3 times for silverware - before getting up and getting it himself.  Once we got the right food and something to eat it with, the Brussel Sprouts appetizer was amazing, everything else was okay.   

Then my husband took a bite of the hummus with olives appetizer and bit into an approx 1 inch X ..5 inch piece of glass.  Not cool.   Took us a while to get the waiter to come back, we showed it to him, and he went to get the manager, then he came back without the manager and said she said to ask what you want instead.   NOTHING, we were done with our meal at that point - very silly question.   The Manager then came and apologized and said she was looking into the glass (good).   

She took the $9.00 off our bill for the Hummus!    Bad experience, mediocre food, and only 9.00 off our bill for a serious piece of glass.  Diners beware!"}
{"text":"Not many good reviews to begin with. Beer list okay but not great. Restrooms in the basement--broken handrail. My wife and I were still up for lunch before the Steelers game until we saw a nice little rodent running around. That's enough for us--avoid if you can!"}
{"text":"Great location..... but the service is terrible and the food is fair at best. Five of us stopped in late in the afternoon for a quick bite...,, that became anything but. Note to self: if a restaurant is rather empty, but you still have to seat yourself.... and then ask at the bar (twice!) if someone is going to take your order.... it's probably not going to be a great experience. And then if utensils and napkins have to practically be begged for, it just adds insult to injury. 

There's a great (!!!!) beer menu.... and the appetizer menu has all of the usual wings and nachos and chipy dippy thingies. I had a delicious hard cider (on tap) and the Pretzel Duo (two baked soft pretzels served with beer cheese & honey mustard). The cider was delicious, but it would have been even better if served in a glass rather than a plastic cup. The pretzels were drenched in butter, but nice and warm. The honey mustard was nothing more than a salad dressing or a sandwich spread.... and the cheese (while super tasty with little bits of hot peppers in it) was not warm enough for actual dipping."}
{"text":"It's a bar. Nothing special. Ordered a pizza and Merlot. Wine came in a whisky glass and pizza dough tasted like pop n fresh dough."}
{"text":"The bar itself is small and tucked in the corner by the door, so not many seats and most of them have a cash register or something else right in front of you.  The bar staff doesn't believe in clearing the PLASTIC cups quickly, so you get to sit in someone else's trash as a bonus.

Once your name is called, you get to go in the back where the TV's can't be seen, the stools are uncomfortable, the service is OK and the food is mediocre at best.

I got the Mac & Cheese.  Ugh.  Kinda semi warm, kinda semi not-so-good.  

They had a lot of beers on tap and in a pretty location, other than that....go somewhere else.  Trust me."}
{"text":"The service is bad. The food is ok. Great beer selection. I visited on wings and yings night; $.60 wings and $2.50 yuenling. 

I ordered a 10 pack of wings - 5 localizer (delicious hot sweet and spicy perfect and garlic parm (yuck! Not enough garlic or park - tasted bland and over cooked. 

The table next to me ordered after me and got served before me - there was a mix up in the kitchen but the waitress hardly checked on me. When she did I complained about the garlic parm wings she took them off the bill which was nice. 

All in all I won't be back. I visit often for work and stay at the spring hill across the street. I'll stick to Soho Hois"}
{"text":"Bad. Really, really bad. I'm going to post photos of our order from tonight. It is inedible and/or incorrect. 

Our order consisted of the soup, flatbread pizza, and kids meal. 

The kids meal stated it came w a drink. Despite ordering one with the meal, it turned out that even though it was offered, that it is not included in to go issues. So basically we spent what equals to about $1.25 for each Mrs. T pierogis without any butter on it, ect.  Just 5 sad boiled, plain piergies that each cost as much as an entire box in the grocery store.  
It was not good. 


We also ordered soup. This is not at all what is served at the restaurant. Just take a look at the picture. I know soup to go isn't going to be perfect, however one expects some broth in soup.  It just a half container of vegetables and topping. The amount served for the price is shocking. Beyond shocking. A total rip off. 

Lastly, our pizza flatbread. It was cut up into pieces and stacked on top of each other in a small box. This created a lump of mushy bread, sauce, and cheese that was completely stuck together. As my kid put it \"Gross, really gross\".  None of them would eat it. And they'll eat anything that halfway resembles flatbread or pizza.  

This was horrible. Not what is served in the restaurant. What's advertised for the kids meal is incorrect. I won't be returning to the restaurant after being ripped off like this.  

Please see the photos. It's bad. Really bad."}
