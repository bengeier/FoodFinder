{"text":"I ordered a number of items from them a few weeks ago via Skipthedishes. With orders over $20, it comes with free delivery to my area, and the prices were very reasonable. I ordered a number of their pasta salads, which were about $4.00 each. For the portion and quality, I'd say it's a very good deal.   I got their Greek pasta salad and their sundried tomato pesto pasta salad. Both of them came in plastic containers with labels detailing exactly what was inside. The vegetables were very fresh and the pasta was cooked to perfection. I also got a beef chili which came, surprisingly, with a bun. The last thing I got was a Filipino breakfast consisting of garlic rice, two eggs done to my liking, tomato slices, and tocino, which is a sweet, cured pork ($7.99). It also came with a coffee or tea. I had the breakfast for lunch and it was super satisfying. A tad oily from the pork, but so good. The rice was deliciously garlicky and my eggs had runny yolks (sunny side up), and the tocino was oily and sweet and amazing.   For under $20, I had enough food to last me 3 meals, and I didn't have to go out in the cold to buy it. Fantastic."}
{"text":"For what it is (cafe inside medical building), it is a convenient and welcomed site, especially after fasting for 12 FRIKEN hours for blood tests.   A yummy assortment of affordable snacks, drinks and ready made food. Also made to order food ranging from regular breakfasts (served all day) to Greek, Indian, Asian and Jamaican choices.   Had the bacon, egg and potato breakfast wrap which had diced red and green bell peppers. The potatoes were a little too soft for my liking but nevertheless it was a fast and tasty breakfast to go. Staff are as sweet as can be."}
