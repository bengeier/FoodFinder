{"text":"This place is fantastic! I eat once or twice a week, but could easily go everyday. The plum chicken, vindaloo, and lamb special are all very good meat dishes and the alu ghobi and matar paneer are delicious veggie dishes. They have a great selection of curries everyday and yes they are all curry. The gentlemen behind will certainly let you know if you just ask for the chicken curry.  They are only open until about 6 pm because of parking costs for the owner which is pretty disappointing, but they've been at it for 10 years and they know what they're doing. Everybody should go here, try it out, and support a great mom and pop restaurant."}
{"text":"So so so good! We are visiting from Texas and I accidentally came across this place. It had a lot of vegetarians options & they were all delicious. There Naan was so good & fresh. Very friendly couple as well!"}
{"text":"This place qualifies as a hidden gem. There's zero advertising - the only way you know about it is by wandering by or by word of mouth. 

This is by far not the fanciest place. Probably not a first date location. It would qualify as fast food but it is delicious and cheap. Catering to the lunch crowd mainly they are now open until 6:30 PM YES! (love it because I live next door). 

Their chicken is always tender and they have SO MANY little variations on their curry bases but they are all excellent and not overdone. 

Someone mentioned that their rice is not Basmatti this is true but I usually get their brown rice. Also, their naan isn't the greatest but it is usually very fresh. 

I go here mainly for their curry special which is an entire gigantic plate of chicken curry (up to 3 types) for $6!! Unbeatable."}
{"text":"Great place for a variety of chicken curries. Chicken vindaloo is my favorite here! and the fact that it is a fast food place, makes it easy for work people to get quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Hands down, some of the best food I've ever eaten. Period. Go. They have it all: veg, meat. Vindaloo, tikka, saag paneer. Homemade naan they roll out and cook right in front of you. The proprietors are incredibly warm. Had chicken curry and cabbage&peas yesterday. Came back today for more. Amazing."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years now (2-3) and I love them. Sweet couple, tasty food, portions that are just right (small) or (large). One of my favorite, quick, good quality filing meals I can get for lunch. 

I don't even have to verbalize my order anymore unless I want to try something new."}
{"text":"I love the people behind the counter. Even after being so rushed because of lunch hour, they truly care about each person that comes to them. Service is amazing. I know where to go when I'm missing mom's roti and daal."}
{"text":"The owners are extremely friendly. Just tell them what you are in the mood for and they'll let you try some samples and find some dishes that have the right flavor/spice. All of the chicken dishes are fantastic, and the cauliflower is a classic. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a business thing and stuck by my self downtown. Cleveland is a weird little city. but  a block from my hotel this little Indian counter struck my fancy. The guy and his wife? were very friendly. I had three different chicken dishes and two veggie. Everything was pretty good.
The only thing I didn't love was the naan. It tasted old and chewy.
If I ever go back to Cleveland, I will stop in for some tasty Indian food."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Indies for a quick lunch... Their schedule is sporadic, but Kabob House is right there if they are closed.  They are incredibly sweet, and I love that they'll make fresh naan for you!  

Yes, the food is pre-cooked, but it's a healthy portion for a great price!"}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite Indian food ever in Cleveland! The man and woman who own it are such sweet hearts. Go here if you want authentic delicious food.  Try the buttered chicken and cauliflower."}
{"text":"I am giving Indies 5 stars based on the following criteria:
1. Quick and Friendly service
2. The food tastes great - The Chicken Tikka Masala is always the perfect spiciness and the vegan special is healthy, yet tasty... and I'm not even vegan. 
3. Reasonably Priced - $6.50 for a quick Indian feast? Yes please!

I would highly recommend going to Indies on your next lunch break, it blows greasy burgers and cardboard pizza out of the water."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place I finally went and they did not disappoint!
I might as well been having my punjabi grandmas home cooking! I had the mattar paneer, dal makhni, aloo gobhi and malai kofta with basmati rice!.. Oh so good! Rest assure I will be back!. The owner if Indies is so nice! Great service!
If you want to know what North Indian home cooking tastes like go here!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious and filling! ! And the Naan bread is cooked fresh, and absolutely delicious! The couple that runs it are hands down the nicest, friendliest owners I have ever met! They put a lot of love and care into their food and their customer service too! If you aren't sure what you like, or what to get, they will let you try anything and everything! It's a great place for a good quick filling lunch outside of the ordinary typical lunch foods and also very affordable! Highly recommended! Try it! You are gonna love it!"}
{"text":"We finally decided to try the food here because of all the great reviews and It DID NOT DISAPPOINT! My husband has never even had Indian food and I've only tried it one other time. The food was sooo good, so flavorful and the owners are so kind! He kept giving us samples of things to try since we told him we haven't really tried Indian food. We will most definitely be back! Bonus: very inexpensive"}
{"text":"Their buttered chicken is delicious, highly suggest getting a piece of naan with your meal as well. Their smoothies are very good too."}
{"text":"Friendly stuff and inexpensive ( three stars), that's the only good thing about this place. I had Chicken carry and chickens tikka marsala, which both were tasteless. Ohhhh wait, i only paid  $6, hmmm still not worth it. The saying  \"you get what u pay for\" holds true here. I am not indian but i have eaten indian food for many years, this place is the worst  (taste). Whoever gave this place more than two/three stars, don't know how indian food taste like. I won't got back again"}
{"text":"I was looking for some non American food and I found it exactly like I pictured. A tiny restaurant operated by a a husband and wife who had a simple menu.  All indicators on my scale of deliciousness for hole in the walls. Ordered Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Masala. Both were delicious and finished it off with naan. Great place for an affordable lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland and stumbled onto this place. Came for breakfast two days in a row. So good!!! Mom and pop homemade Indian food, the naan was being rolled out and cooked to order. The owners were sweet and took great care of us. The second day we were indecisive and the proprietress said she would make something delicious for us. It was fantastic!"}
{"text":"It's cheap, delicious, and a short walk from my office.  I really like that you can choose 3 options for the lunch special.  I am a big fan of the tikka masala, palak paneer, and the alu gohbi.

Fresh made naan is also wonderful.  The owners are super nice and will explain what each item is for anyone that is unfamiliar."}
{"text":"Run by a lovely Punjabi couple. This whole in the wall stand is nestled in the older arcade. 
The prices and portions are unbeatable! 
We got three entrees with rice for less than 8 dollars each. 
The highlight for me was the fish curry (special of the day) whereas for my boyfriend it was the saag chicken. 
The only reason why it's not a five is that the dishes are milder than what we are used to (my bf is Indian and we are from the tristate area) but I suppose its flavors are meant to appeal to the general population. 
I would definitely come back and support this  restaurant!"}
{"text":"Being Indian,  I have high standards for Indian food and this place lives up to them! Great tasting Punjabi food, with a unique home made kind of taste. The dishes seem to be prepared as per the original recipe instead of using a common base. The desserts are delicious too. They also make indian chai that is so hard to come by."}
{"text":"Great Indian food by people that clearly care deeply for the food and their customers. You may not find better customer service downtown and the food is hard to beat. It's a great place to go for lunch where I can get a to-go box full of food that tastes great and only spend around $8. I find myself craving their food and going back a couple times a week."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for lunch if I have the opportunity to go downtown during the work week.

The curries are all amazing and the prices are reasonable. I usually order a lamb or goat curry and one or two vegetable dishes.

The owner and his wife are very nice and are helpful when sorting out the many menu options."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so badly. I love Indian food and it would be nice to have a good Indian place downtown rather than having to drive out each time I'm craving it. 

I went in around 5pm and was immediately greeted by an Indian gentleman, he was so kind and explained the menu to me and what my options are. There are many items to choose from and their popular combo is any three items on the menu over basmati or brown rice for just $6.75-- what a deal! 

I went with two popular Indian dishes; butter chicken, and tikka masala. The portions are very generous. I've had these dishes many times over the past few years and consider my palate to be expert when it comes to Indian flavors. Unfortunately, the flavors did not deliver. If someone else ordered for me and asked me to guess what I'm eating, it would be impossible as the flavors are way off. I couldn't eat more than a few bites. It's bland but one great thing is that the chicken is cooked thoroughly, it's still tender and I love that. 

Customer service is great and prices are very good. I'll keep hunting downtown for Indian food..."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for business for almost 10 months. My work location was few blocks from the Colonial Market Place. As I travelled for only four days, I need one time a home style indian meal. The Indies is awesome. They are open for breakfast and lunch only. The owners are aged and they are nice to everyone. They have someone who can deliver the dinner meal to hotel, I paid little extra bucks for delivery charge. Trust me, it is much better service than Deliver ME food site. 

The samosas are very delicious. The food was great great.
Try break fast at this place. The omelete and paratha are awesome. If you like Aloo Paratha that is good too.
Great place, I wish they were open in the evening too."}
{"text":"Got a 3 chicken meal with some nan. Vindaloo, Tikka Masala, and something the guy  told me was real good so I got it.  Its was all good except for the chicken being dry in the Tikka Masala. The man and lady running the place were SUPER nice. Good food, nice people."}
{"text":"I was having lunch at another outlet in Arcade. While waiting for my lunch I walked over to Indies. The owner could not have been any nicer or more genuine! Offered me multiple samples, educated me on Indian food, spices, styles...The flavors were authentic and fresh. No wonder he has had a successful 10 year run in this location. Super reasonable prices. Had a lentil soup and will be back for many more complete meals...."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times while I was staying in Cleveland.

Loved their food and the owner (husband and wife) was very nice to me.

The last time I ate there, I found a hair in my food.

Sad, because I really liked this place..."}
{"text":"Butter chicken is the best I've ever had! 3 item plate with basmati and brown rice was around $6.75. Chicken Tikka Masala is on par either the deliciousness of butter chicken. Jerk Chicken was also a highlight! Palak Paneer was very good."}
{"text":"Food is freshly made every day. So it's got that going for it. Really nice couple cook/serve you.  But I was so excited to have 4.5 star Indian food. It just wasn't. Flavor wasn't there. And I so wanted it to be!! I love Indian food and I was craving it. Didn't feel bad not eating it all cause it was only $6.75."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with this place. The food is traditional and homemade each day. The prices are reasonable and portions are HUGE! I sometimes ask for a recommendation and they have never steered me wrong."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto indies while looking for kabob house which was sadly closed.  It was well past lunch time, I was new to the city, and wanted something quick so I could grab a nap at the hotel.  I settled.  The food was precooked, and may have been more then a day old.  The proprietors were sweet and friendly, so I didn't want to offend them when they asked what I thought about the food.  I ended up having a few bites to tide me over and then continuing to my hotel."}
{"text":"This is located in the 5th Street Arcade building in the food court area. I'm a fan as I have been here three times in two weeks as I work downtown.  Very good variety of lunch specials and the homemade India cuisine is very good here! Kudos to the love able owners."}
{"text":"Water down currys with tasteless rice. I just cant see how people are giving this high ratings. Have you not had indian food elsewhere?"}
{"text":"Really great food. Great vegan options and the only Indian vegan I could find.  There is another local Indian but they butter everything."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite lunch spot in town. The food is incredibly delicious and the owners are the cutest ever."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I found it accidentally while exploring downtown Cleveland. Being a Punjabi I can vouch for their aloo paranthe. They are as good as my mom's!! I am definitely going back"}
{"text":"Okay two stars for the really sweet couple that run this place but take it from an Indian the food is awful. I had the tandoori curry on white rice and it was bland and extremely watered down."}
{"text":"Like others have said, it is a cute Mom and Pop place. The husband and wife that run it are super friendly. Their menu is a bit hard to read and understand. So every time I go, I ask for a mix of vegetarian items, they always give me great stuff. The Channa Masala is so great! The portions are huge and prices are small. Oh get some naan too, its delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good food and good prices- for $10 I got their very hot chicken (very spicy- not as hot hot hot as I like, but a nice spice), both brown and basmati rice, chickpeas and potatoes, vegetable dumpling, naan, and 2 samosas. The food was very good- I loved the chicken and the chickpeas. The samosas were incredible and the service was outstanding. The couple that runs it have been in business 10 years and are very concerned with health and quality. I will be returning next week for a lunch meeting."}
{"text":"I got the eggplant (bartha) and cauliflower (gobi) with tilapia. Really good. 

Went only once. Good food considering that the place wasn't the most modern looking. Even better service with friendly mom and pop working the counter."}
{"text":"Might not be the best Indian food I've had (I'm a big fan of Namaste in Lakewood). However, for the price, portion and location you can't go wrong with Indies.  Pretty popular place downtown for a quick Indian lunch.  I usually get two types of curries (Butter Chicken, Aloo Gobi) w/ a huge serving of rice for $7.  I've had other combinations and they are all really tasty.  The wife and husband that run this place are endearing and kind.  I hope they never retire!"}
{"text":"Indies is fantastic! The couple that own it are really the most sweet people you will ever meet, and once they know you... you will start to see some of the ribbing they do with each other and their clientele. 
The food! Yes - it's wonderful. They always have seasonal specials and will recommend all sorts of things. The Mulligatawny soup is great... the Mango lasse and the Kheer is great to finish off the meal. They only have a take out counter, but i frequent there about every other week. The chicken, matar paneer and other foods have always been solid. It's all \"homemade\" by the owner and definitely not cook to order - but this is crock-pot kind of food! Great for lunch. 

(p.s. watching the old Bollywood music videos while waiting for food is always a trip!)"}
{"text":"This place is certainly a hidden gem. The food has so much variety and serves everyone's needs. The owners are friendly and sweet. I can order ahead of time and it is always ready at the time I request. The food is delicious and very affordable. Where else can you get 3-4 assorted vegetables with rice and fresh naan around this area !"}
{"text":"Boasting astoundingly affordable and piping hot fresh foodstuffs of various savory texture and consistency, Indies is a perfect fast-grab Indian lunch spot, conveniently located in the heart of Cleveland's esteemed 5th Street Arcade. Indeed, of all six or so lunch spots crammed into the small, dingy, rather viciously humid food court at the arcade's center, Indies was the only with a substantial line--and with good reason. The portions are huge and served rapid fire, though there was some slowdown when the credit reader malfunctioned. The owner (?) was affable, if slightly cold, telling one guest in no uncertain terms that there was no way he'd be able to select for the guest, or surprise the guest, and it was up to the guest alone to choose every one of his three-for-$6.75 options from the admittedly slightly difficult to read and confusing menu above (such menu, it should be noted was kindly broken up into vegetarian/vegan and meat options). This no-nonsense attitude is rather humorous to John Q Onlooker, and also probably should be sort of expected, as one imagines the owner (?) feels the stress of the quotidian nonstop lunch rush given just how tasty and satisfying his menu offerings are. Others have described the food as lacking on the spices, but your reviewer's medley of #2, #5, and #13 was an expert blend of spicy, savory, and sweet. The naan was slightly doughy, however, and probably won't be on the list next visit. Regardless, for those in a hurry, Indies is, on the whole, prime time tasty and well worth the minimal price tag."}
{"text":"There used to be a glut of Indian places downtown, but this is it now. Luckily, it's a great little lunch spot, especially for vegetarians. Yes, most of the food is pre-made, but it's also very, very homemade. I don't have an Indian granny, but I like to think that this is how she'd cook. As has been mentioned, the owners are sweet and friendly. Most items are good, not great, but the prices are really fair. Some things are not good pre-made (naan!), but most Indian dishes handle a steam tray with aplomb. I always leave stuffed with homemade goodness for like $6. Hard to beat that."}
{"text":"It's a nice place, inexpensive and tasty. It is not exactly on Euclid avenue but one needs to go inside the building. The lunch with three dishes and rice for $7 is the best deal one can get"}
{"text":"Small little place in mall downtown. Had much better Indian food but it was ok because of location downtown, quantity and to go.  I was staying in hotel nearby and needed something quick. A Shiek and a nice. Woman scoop out your 2 meats and a Vegi over rice. Had to pay .75 for coriander chutney and $1 for naan. No seating assigned but tables spread around mall. 

Quality-2
Fast-3
Price for what you get -3
Taste-2 watered down basmati and tiki. 

I'll go back if I'm back in town and need something fast. I'm sure there are better Indian places elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch carryout spot. Super tasty food, super nice people, fair price. Can't say enough about how much we love this place at my office."}
{"text":"An absolute HIDDEN GEM!!!!! Mom and pop type place. Very quick authentic and amazingly delicious. Completely stumbled upon this place and so glad that I did. I will be here again when I am in town again."}
{"text":"Naam best in this country.  Nice couple who run it if they have it IRS foursale .the be in touch with the following link below or copy this message in whole or part"}
{"text":"This is a solid Indian food stand. I had three different curried vegetables with brown rice and it was delicious. It wasn't spicy either. Also, it was large portion, so it was very filling. The man behind the counter was very nice and was patient with me while I selected my entrees.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Indies is a cute little Indian take out place in the Colonial Arcade food court.  

Truth be told, I've had better Indian, but Indies is good for a quick lunch.  There is a good selection of both vegetarian and chicken dishes, including some specials that are not your average tandoori chicken.  The Alu Gobi (caulifllower) and the Mattar Paneer (peas 'n' cheese) are my favorites.  The Briyani special is really good- spiced chicken and rice with a huge side of cool raita.  The raita is fresh and homemade, BTW.  The mango lassis are perfect for nursing a hangover!!!

The real stand out here is breakfast.  Alu Paratha is described as \"Indian style pancake stuffed with potatoes\".  It's more like a very thin naan stuffed with spicy minced potatoes and served with a much needed cooling raita.  It takes about ten minutes from order to receipt, because the chef makes each one fresh.  Boy is it worth it.    Be warned-- hot means India hot!  Ask for mild or moderate unless you are, in fact, fireproof."}
{"text":"It is so frustrating to find a place downtown with great food, only to find that the service is terrible. Well, I am happy to report that Indies is not one of those places. Not only is the food delicious, fresh, housemade from scratch and reasonably priced, the owners who run the business are extremely kind and wonderful. 

I am a big fan of the delicious mutter paneer - a creamy curry with delicious chunks of paneer cheese, but I also am glad they have less rich vegetarian options as well. 

The only thing I don't love at Indies, unfortunately, is the rice. I think it comes down to texture - I personally think that most Indian dishes, particularly the creamy ones, need a firmer rice like Basmati. I don't really care for the soft rice that they serve (similiar to Korean sticky white rice). But perhaps that is just a matter of preference.

Something cool that happened there once: Next to the restaurant portion of Indies is their lottery / soft drinks / newsstand business. I was once in line behind a guy who bought a $2 scratch-off... He scratched it at the counter, and it was a winner for $20,000!!! That was pretty exciting."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while in town.  Hard to find the place but the food was worth it.  Large portions with us each getting the lunch special which let you get 3 options of food over rice for less than $7.   Good deal and tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"OMG this is so good! Spicy aloo paratha, homemade yogurt, and hot chai for breakfast. The Indian lady who made all this was really nice. Low price too. Tastes just like what I'd get in SF. All the people in the American restaurant across the way need to come over here - they don't know what they're missing!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have ever had!! And the man and his wife are really nice and friendly. The food is super cheap and has amazing quality!!"}
{"text":"Nice little vendor in the arcade food court by Sakura and the kabob place. Very nice Punjabi or Sikh   husband and wife who are very helpful. Food is delicious for quick lunch. Most of it is pre made and just kept warm and he has great combo meal selections for less than 10 bucks.  Like most downtown places wish it was open later at night instead of being closed after I got home from work day."}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop place where they'll give you a to go box of just about anything over rice for $6 and you can choose three items.

Add a 16oz soda bottle and two slices of bread and you've got a meal that should fill you up for $8.50.

If you're not sure what you like, they'll ask if you like spicy or mild and choose something you should like.

The food was pretty good and nice flavor. Only downside is the chicken curries are a bit more on the brothy side whereas im used to seeing them served in a thicker sauce.

Located in the food court of the little mall next to the Hodges sign"}
{"text":"Just a hole in the wall, fast food place in Colonial Marketplace with some REAL home cooked indian food. If you're looking for fancy restaurant quality, ridiculously creamy and rich, may be laced with something - indian food, look elsewhere. When i ate my meal from Indies, I literally felt like I was either at home or at a friends house eating their mom's home cookin. I think everything is premade that morning and put out on burners to be kept warm. It may not be made to order, but it definitely still tastes fresh. They have a few veg curries and a couple of meat options. They have naan and a new wrap (that I want to go back to try). Like one of the previous reviews stated, the downfall is the rice they use. You really do need something like basmati rice for indian food.

The owners are a sweet indian couple and they are some of the nicest people you'll talk to. 

The owner closes Indies at 6pm because he said if he doesn't move his car by then, the garage charges him another 25 dollars and he most likely won't make that back by staying an hour later - but I was also told that if I'm running late but still want food, to call him and he will have his wife stay while he just moves his car to street parking. :) 

I'm glad this place is right next door for the times I just want some authentic indian home-cookin."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, and more yes.  This place is everything I want in a lunch joint and more. Stopped in for what I was hoping to be a quick lunch and wasn't disappointed.
The restaurant itself is located inside the arcade building, which isn't the most convenient in terms of parking but it's better than waiting in the insane lunch line at Chipotle.
 The owner immediately engaged in a friendly conversation with me when I approached the counter, and was eager to explain the menu to me when I told him it was my first time there. Basically they have daily lunch specials, but the highlight is the pick 3 combo- you can pick almost any 3 things on their menu, vegetarian or otherwise,  served on white or brown rice for six bucks and change. I also ended up ordering a side of naan to compliment my medley of curries, and they also have a wide variety of canned and bottled beverages to choose from. The food itself didn't knock my socks off or anything, but to be fair, I'm rarely wowed by Indian food in general. However, the food was hot, fresh and tasty. This combined with the great service and the price makes it a winner for me. Would highly recommend to others looking for a quick lunch in the downtown area."}
