{"text":"Overall it was good! Service was okay, food was great! Atmosphere was nice! It's a all you can eat place so fest as much as you want...EXCEPT the desert.

Don't get me wrong! The desert WAS AWESOME! They're creme brûlée was PERFECTION! The only sucky part was that you're limited to JUST ONE DESERT.

there were 2 options, creme brûlée and melona(?). You can have BOTH but only ONE OF EACH. That sucked :( and that's the reason why it's only a 4/5 lol!"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: 4/5

All you can eat with pretty good quality meat. My favourites are the beef tongue, chicken knee cartilage and the enoki mushrooms. The beef tongue is thinly sliced,  so it doesn't long to cook at all. I just like the texture of the cartilage, probably not for everyone.  The enoki mushrooms are served in little tin foil bowls with a good slab of butter, can't g wrong with this. It uses to be more garlicky,  but nowadays, there seems to be a hint of honey in it. I don't prefer the sweetness, but didnt stop me from eating out. I also like the pork cheek, but the thinner parts always got burnt for me. Another favourite would probably be the melona popsicle that came at the end. 

Service:
Once we were seated after waiting for almost 2 hours,  our server was great. He was efficient and attentative. The hostesses up front were nice, but I felt they were slightly disorganized,  or maybe I'm just a little bitter because she told me the wait would be an hour, but it was closer to 2 hours. We did go on father's day at 6pm. We tried to make reservations,  but they didn't take any for tables of less than 6. If it wasn't for father's day and I knew the wait was 2 hours , I definitely would have left. It's good food, but not worth the wait in my opinion. 

Atmosphere: 
Loud from all the people and grills as expected.  Very fun atmosphere. Great for big groups too. The smoke and the smell get into your clothes and hair though,  so dress accordingly. 

Final thoughts: I would go on a weekday when the wait isn't as long and it's cheaper. There's a two hour limit once you put your first order down. They are pretty strict on it, at least on the weekends. They give you a heads up for last call 20 minutes before your time is up. I ate till the very last minute, so I told my popsicle to go :) can't forget that."}
{"text":"Meats quality are very good, lot of selections. But there is a 2 hours seating! Can't really enjoy the whole dinner and the quality of everything. They will rush you through everything you order and eat. Because the service and rushing this place will be my last choice of table BBQ."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night, had to wait for an hour but it was well worth it! Right after when we got seated, our orders of food arrived promptly and our waiter was amazing! He even came over a couple of times to help us cook. :) The slices of meat were marinated to perfection. Large variety of meat and veggies. 

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Rally nice Japanese style BBQ, the time farm is really tense. The waitress will explain each kind of meat really patiently working fast as a bee."}
{"text":"I don't understand why they call themselves Japanese BBQ when it is clearly Korean style and run by Chinese. Sarcastically the best item is neither Chinese nor Korean, the caramel pudding, although the house short rib is not too bad and worthy of trying. Other than that, nothing really lives up to the hype. Successful marketing! One hour waiting time even on a Thursday. Ridiculous time limit, two hours max. for dinner. Overpriced as compared to others with the taste and quality of food. Can't issue proper receipt."}
{"text":"Sorry everyone. This place is not Japanese. Period. From the moment you enter and hear a horrendous half assed rendition of \"irasshaimase\", to the poor quality food and $45 a person bill. Yup. You, too, shall leave with the feeling of being had. Purely a Chinese joint cashing in on the Japanese food hype. Also got diarrhea.  Probably from the salmon carpaccio."}
{"text":"the food tastes above average but the meat selection is limited.  most meat is cut so thin, it helps to cook fast but it also makes them burn and overcooked easily (and it is not juicy).  it is a bit overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 of my friends for dinner. The meat was very good but we didn't like how there was a 2 hour seating limit even though it wasn't very busy. We were rushed to finish our food. Not many dessert options. Also very expensive, not sure if I would come here again."}
{"text":"meat quality pretty good for AYCE place.  Order came super quick I guess due to their seating limit of 2hrs.  Server were very friendly and fun.  Nice environment.  Would come again when it's less busy.  Don't really like the 2 hrs seating limit....too rush and can't enjoy some talk with frds."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best ayce bbq I've had! 

Service
Great service for an ayce establishment. The servers all spoke English and also Cantonese/Mandarin. Our server asked if we have been there before and proceeded to explain the menu to us. She also explained the sauce to us and what meat it should be used for along with the recommended cooking time for each meat. The grill was changed frequently without asking. One small thing though is that we tried calling for an hour to make a reservation and no one picked up. We just walked in and there were plenty of seats.

Quality
The meat quality is pretty awesome for an ayce, even rivals some a la carte Korean bbq places I've tried. The best meat is the Kalbi Boneless Short Ribs - oh my god. Melt in your mouth goodness with delicious meat juices. The highlight here is definitely their beef. Have to mention that the creme brulee was really good too! Everything tasted really fresh and each meat stood out unlike at ayce kbbq where everything starts tasting the same after a while.

General
The pricing is quite steep compared to other ayce kbbq joints but I definitely am going to return. Keep in mind that they do enforce their 2 hour seating policy and it is a 12% service charge (clearly noted on the menu)."}
{"text":"I have been to Gyubee a few times and each time I leave satisfied. 

Each time I have arrived, I never had to wait more than 30 minutes for a table. 

The food is great and the service is wonderful every time. Unlike a lot of Asian restaurants, the servers ask how your meal is and if the food is okay throughout your experience.

I also love the variety of cuts of meat you can choose from and it does not compare to Chako or Korean Grill House (both of which are the closest AYCE BBQ). There are also a lot of side dishes to choose from. They also have unlimited bibimbap for order! The best part is the Melona at the end of the meal. 

However, the downside is the MSG. I believe it is only found in the bean sprouts, marinated beef and the seasoning on the table. I am parched each time I leave the restaurant and feel as if I had just woken up from a night out. 

Overall I am very satisfied with this restaurant and would always recommend :)."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for what you get, but meat quality certainly was better than other AYCE bbq places. Service was also surprisingly good and attentive as well for a Chinese run restaurant. Pleasantly surprised and will probably go back again.

They only take Cash or Debit."}
{"text":"Really delicious and the beef tonger so soft, anyway all is good and better try the zero alcohol cock tail."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Though the food came out quickly, our yet-to-be-eaten food was also cleared from our table equally as quickly. We were not done eating some of it! 

The taste of the food was mediocre. I've eaten better food.  

Worst is: we were reminded over and over again by a waitress that we had a 2-hour seating time limit and 30 minutes before our \"time was up\", we were handed the bill. At the same time, my friend did not feel well and was in the washroom when the same waitress came by, yet again reminding me of our seating time limit and since I had the bill, she asked me to vacate the seat even though our  2-hour was not up yet... The restaurant wasn't even busy. I told her that I'll vacate when my friend returns. She came by a few minutes later and again asked me to vacate, to pay and to wait for my friend outside. 

Do NOT go there unless you like to be rushed through your meal. Their service sucks and they have the audacity to charge a mandatory 12% service charge! Go elsewhere to eat. 

I would NOT go back."}
{"text":"This has to be the top ayce BBQ chain in Markham/Toronto just based on the quality of the meat and he variety. Bonus is the dessert which is a nice popsicle!"}
{"text":"Not worth it for $33.  They are charging holiday pricing all December long is just unreal.  If your child is under 12 but too tall in their opinion (55 inch).  They get charged the adult price too."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with my family of four plus a baby. Tried calling to make a reservation but was told that we cannot because they need a group of 6 for reservation - suggested walking in instead.  We got there at 5:30pm and the place was packed!! 

Space - a little tight but not too smokey. Good ventilation.
Service - excellent service. Our server was friendly and helpful. When our food is about to run out she will be there taking our order. We rarely had to flag her down. Food came very quickly and the order was accurate (unlike some AYCE places where half the order is missing and you need to chase them down for it).
Food - everything was good! I really enjoyed the kalbi.
Price - fair for the cost of food. 12% gratuity is included, which I also thought was fair.

It was a very satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"First of all they tried to forcefully make us order the set menu, and then when we realized what they had done (I don't eat pork so I wanted to change it) they refused and said \"the order is already placed and you can put the pork to the side\", seriously?? You placed the order without even confirming with us?

Second, they sat us down then had the nerve to come back and tell us to get up because they made a mistake and it was someone else's seat. Mind you, there were no reservations involved, it's a first come first serve system. 

Also, their drinks are overpriced and lack variety."}
{"text":"We came here during lunch time. There was no line up and we were quickly seated. The lunch menu is good enough since most of the essential meat is there. We loved the ribs and pork belly. I also ordered a peach soda drink and it was great! Very authentic peach taste!

Service was not great but friendly enough. The only downside was, our second round of meat order was neglected. After they brought us soup and rice, we waited for a long time and then we realized that they have forgotten about our meat so we had to re-order."}
{"text":"Service was great since we booked in advance and what we ordered was what we got (except for the occasional slips of the quantity). Super good cuts of the meat and it is very nice how it is not marinated. The menu is way better than Chako's and Korean Grill House as it has more variety, quality is better, and the flavour is also better. The dessert really surprised me since it wasn't the usual ice cream. The melona popsicles were great! Great to go with a small or big group."}
{"text":"Food was good, the meats seem fresh.  I dont like the time limit of 2hrs because the cooking is slow."}
{"text":"Located at Woodbine and Steeles, Gyubee is an all- you-can-eat Japanese grill restaurant.  We came for lunch and interestingly we were offered both the lunch and dinner menu (apparently the dinner menu is 10% off at lunch). The dinner menu is more extensive than the lunch menu. Ultimately, we opted for the lunch menu. 

We had a selection of kalbi beef, pork belly, chicken thigh, Taiwanese sausage, shrimp, and veggies. Our favorites were the kalbi beef and pork belly.   The meat was generally of pretty good quality although occasionally you would get pieces that were quite fatty. The marinade for the kalbi beef is decent  and as far as I know, the other types and cuts of meat were not marinaded. Some people might find this a little bland however I was not too bothered by it. 

I always find the experience of grilling meat at your table an enjoyable one (I suspect most people enjoy this with the exception of vegetarians and vegans of course).   The service is attentive and quick.  On a weekday lunch, the restaurant was also quite busy with few empty tables.   The overall ambience was quite nice. 

The soft drinks have free refills and there is also a selection of alcoholic drinks and cocktails. 

In conclusion, my lunch experience was quite nice (it helps that this was a rare opportunity to have a weekday lunch date with my wife). Had the quality of the meat been slightly better I would have provided a higher score.  Overall, Gyubee is a decent all-you-can-eat grilled meat establishment but it does not offer anything above and beyond similar restaurants. 

All right, after this all-you-can-eat meal (why do I do this to myself), I have to go hit the gym now.  Until the next review....."}
{"text":"Was not a fan of this place. I came on a weekday (30.99) and was told it was an hour long wait. So I told the employee I'd be back in an hour because I didn't want to sit and wait. She said theyd have a table ready by the time I got back. When I got back, she said my table wouldn't be ready for another 20 minutes which actually ended up being 30 minutes. Was not impressed by the wait time and the lack of customer service. When I complained, she was unapologetic and simply asked if I still wanted the table. 

However, after that issue, the food turned out to be alright or maybe I was just too hungry at that point to tell. The other waiters were pleasant and brought food out quickly. Definitely not worth my time waiting for a table, constrained to a 2hr eating limit and money though (also charge a 12% service fee). I'd much rather just head over to Chako for quicker service and cheaper price. 


Overall, food itself would have been a 4/5 but the whole seating issue was very frustrating."}
{"text":"Service is absolute garbage. Dont open at all. Problem solved. 

I go to the downtown location more often than I should...I tried out Gyubee markham and I have never left anywhere more upset. My mom and I showed up for dinner at 9pm (They close at 11pm). As we were being brought to our table we were reminded 4 times that last call was at 10:20pm. I figured that would be ample time to get a few orders in. After getting our first order, a server promptly came by and removed the sauce and seasoning from our table stating that they need to clean because they were closing soon. Fine. I went to use their bathroom and there was a sign on the door saying it was closed for cleaning. Mind you, it is now currently 940pm. When i tried to order my second order, I was reminded again that last call was now 10pm. We ordered our last order and decided to finish up quickly. As we were finishing another server came by and said we needed to order dessert because they were closing. So i ordered a couple cream brulees... we still had food on the table. After the creme brulees came, they came over with my bill and a debit machine and started giving me a speech in mandarin... i dont speak mandarin... i put my debit card in and as i was entering my pin the server advised that tip was included in my bill. I paid and left."}
{"text":"I was hanging out with a friend around Markham and we were feeling very hungry during dinner time so we decide to go for all you can eat bbq. We found this place in yelp so we decide to try it out around 8:30ish. When we enter through the door there were huge line up and needed to wait for seats. We waited around 1 hour and 40 mins to be called to eat. The menu have a variety of selection of meats, seafood and vegetables. The meat was marinated well and have some taste in it.  One of the food that I found is good and recommend is marinated Kalbi and shrimp. The cold noodles also is pretty good. For Desserts the creme brûlée was very good. Also melon popsicle at the end. The service is decent which they give us all the food that I order, exactly amount. The staff is friendly which they willing to take your order at anytime. Additionally, there is a 2 hour limit to eat, this is understandable since there is a long lineup.  Also the last call is 10:20pm so order everything by then.
The problem is that the wait is too long for a pricey kbbq around 40ish plus tax for dinner so I wasn't that satisfied, since I was very hungry at that time."}
{"text":"Service:
- they should include a WiFi service especially for those waiting for a LONG time for a seat during busy hours
- once we were seated, the waiter/waitress rushed us to order 

Food:
- unlike other places. they have boneless meat and the shrimps are peeled
- one type of meat were hard to cook because the meat were sliced too thinly 
- too much butter in the sweet potatoes + enoki mushrooms that was placed inside a foiled tin 
- overall, their menu have a bit more variety (for dinner)

Overall: 
- would have liked to give this place a 3 stars, but i can't give it because they kept rushing customers to order quickly and providing people a booth seating that can only fit 2 people when there's 5 people in total. their solution was to add a chair at the end to fit 5 people -
which was uncomfortable and squishy when trying to enjoy the meal. 
- also didn't understand why they didn't accept credit cards?"}
{"text":"Food was DELISH. There's a huuge selection of appetizers and meat to choose from and everything's really well seasoned. 

The only thing was the wait time to be seated.. Came here on a Friday night and was told we'd be seated in half an hour but we ended up waiting a full hour. The restaurant doesn't take reservations for less than 5 people so if you're not with a squad, be ready to wait. We had lychee mojitos while we waited which were super tasty but if you don't feel like drinking, they do have a waiting room and free wifi lolz 

All in all, food was served quickly, staff were fun 'n friendly! Best part? MELONA popsicles for dessert. Yes, Melona. Unfortunately not unlimited but the perfect way to end the meal. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed when I came with two friends. We waited almost to an hour to get a table, so make sure you get a reservation. From eavesdropping another group who had made resevations, they won't seat you until your whole party is here. The staff at the entrance are rather rude and relentless. However, the staff actually serving you when you're seated are very helpful, speedy and above all patient (they will provide you pointers and tips if you are unsure about how to prepare your food). Being a lover of soft bone, I was thrilled that chicken knee was an option on the menu. It was also nice that they served Melona as an option for dessert. Overall great food and service, but score was brought down due to being a bit pricey and the much needed attitude adjustment of the hostess at the entrance."}
{"text":"Would NOT recommend to anyone, and definitely would NOT come back. 

For a very steep price of $33 per person, we were rushed through dinner and this being our first time here, we tried everything on the menu. The beef was decent, but everything else was underwhelming. 

Most of the meat are sliced so thinly that they burn through easily. Our grill caught fire so many times, and the staff just walks on by, not offering to help adjust the temperature. They also never offered to change our severely burnt grill. 

The variety of their menu is sad, considering the price they are charging. For dessert, we got melona, and what do you know, it was those cheap Asian popsicles you can get at grocery stores. Seriously, they literally give you the stick in the packaging. 

I had such a bad experience here, even if they lowered their price, I would not come back."}
{"text":"Tried this out with a group of 6 for my cousin birthday a few weeks ago, it's pretty expensive on weekends and a packed house. Service was fairly decent and food came or fast..it's like a fancier better quality version of chako Korean bbq. 
They definitely had better quality of meats, I'm just not a huge fan of this style of ayce as it takes a long time to cook the food on a small grill and they limit your seating time to 2 hours...hence...hubby left hungry. Oops haha
It was nearly 90 bucks for 2 people so it's definitely on the expensive side, drinks are not included and dessert is only melona ice cream which they limit you to 1 only per person and creme brûlée which was quite good but by the time last call came we ordered too little of creme brûlée and they refused to let us reorder even though it was only 10 minutes after. For 45 bucks a person I think they can afford to give us another round of crime brûlée or a second melona (eyeroll)"}
{"text":"Great quality with their short ribs and shrimp. Highly recommend- it is on the pricier end but you get what you pay for. Menu selection is great, and the creme brûlée is ridiculously good. Everything was good at the restaurant, all I can say is that the wait times are ridiculous if you don't have reservations. They have a room specifically for people to sit and wait, and I can't understand why they don't turn the waiting area to a dining area and have more grills and table so people don't have to wait over an hour... 

Only takes reservations for 6 people or more, and although I didn't have to wait, I know it would be a huge struggle to come with less than 6 people. Reservations are quite strict as well, the waitresses literally called 3 times to confirm if I had a party of 6 which was quite annoying, and they made sure to be explicit about cancelling my reservations if I only had 5.. (not a great experience prior to coming in) luckily once I got to the restaurant they were much more accommodating. The 3 phone calls to confirm my party of 6 was uncalled for. Could be 5 stars if they just expanded and upgraded the amount of seats available with their waiting room to cut down wait time

Awesome service, waitresses were actually around and would check up to see if more orders would need to be placed. There is a 2 hour seating limit and if you are efficient with your cooking and ordering, it is sufficient"}
{"text":"I've now been to Gyubee three times, and I will probably be back again.  It's the deliciously marbled kalbi boneless short rib that gets me (#1 on the meats menu), which is pretty decent quality.  And not, like, \"good for AYCE\", it's actually legit decent!

If you've never been to Gyubee, you'll be offered a sampler platter to start which has a little bit of everything for you to try. I'd recommend extra orders of the kalbi boneless, keeping in one mind that \"one order\" = a single slice.

I'm not a huge fan of pork, but I've been told it's pretty good quality too.

Watch out when picking the chicken cartilage though, as it sometimes has bits of bone fragments inside.

Don't forget to order your Melona dessert bar (limited to one per person) to top off your meat-tastic meal!"}
{"text":"While, the decor is reminiscent of Japan and they play Japanese music, this is really more of a Korean BBQ as opposed to Yakiniku  (Japanese BBQ). Actually, it's funny how the staff says \"irrashaimase!\" in broken Japanese, when you walk in.

That said, the food is excellent. The meat is very well marinated and tasty. My favorite items are the boneless short ribs, the pork cheeks and pork belly. YUM!

Wait time can be a bit of a B-word, so I would advise a reservation for groups of 5 and more. Also, because it's generally busy, you have about 2 hours to eat. They let you know when you're 20 mins away from last call to order more food."}
{"text":"I was expecting a shorter wait for a Tuesday night but gyubee is too poppin. Waited 40 min to an hour for a seat. While I was waiting I wondered if it would be better to turn the waiting room into actual dining space. 
Other than that, food was great! The waitress was super nice and my seat was next to the window and pretty comfy. The enoki mushrooms.... UHG so gud.  
At the end you get créme brûlée or Melona!!!! 
My bf likes how the menus simple and straight forward (:"}
{"text":"My first experience at Guybee was amazing. The food and service was beyond what I expected and I can never go back to regular kbbq. There is always someone checking up on you to make sure you are having a good time. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I asked for everything and they literally give you portion sizes variety of everything they have in menu to try. Japanese Korean grill where you have to cook your own food, there is no sushi or anything like that here... I would say it's more like a Korean grill house.

They have bibimbap that's fairly small sized, good appetizer to get before your meat gets cooked. A bit bland however. Not a fan of the grill as it's sticky, makes it difficult to prepare the food. The meat quality is only average, nothing special in particular. Deserts includes either strawberry/manga Melona bars & creme brûlée (really good, recommend)

Nice and cozy, a booth fits around 8 people but you can squeeze a couple more if you have a bigger crowd. Well light and can be a bit tight once you order more food.

~$38.72 - If you come before 5:30pm/9pm, it's 10% off! Cash and debit only. Make a reservation so you won't have to wait in their lounge area, only get 2 hours to eat before they kick you out (we call shenanigans!)"}
{"text":"Was told that they would not take my American debit card, but that I could run across the street to get cash the ATM.  I did so, it took 5 minutes.  When I returned they told me that the wait was now 40 minutes.  Horrible way to treat any potential customer... beware!!!"}
{"text":"Newly opened Japanese Bbq place, have to say everything is above expectation. The food is fresh and the presentation is nice. All you can eat with decent price. Service is fast and they change the grill quite often. The environment is also very cozy, good for friends gathering or even romantic dating. Lol 

Love this place, will definitely go often cuz I'm I the area! I'm happy,:p"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and customer service was great. I was surprised how attentive the server was. My favourite thing at gyubee was actually their Creme brûlée! It was nice to finish the meal with tasty a dessert and they also gave us Melona popsicles."}
{"text":"Price is good. Beef is good. Dessert is good. I need this restaurant in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here on a late night (10% off after 9PM - totally worth it as they are a bit more expensive for AYAC).  Dark decor and booths were a bit small, but overall good vibe.  

Vast meat options include various of beef/chicken/pork.  My fav is their house marinated kalbi.  Their veggie options are limited, but then few others are suitable for their grill.  That's because the grill gets a bit of open fire and everything gets cooked really quickly.  Sweet potato and buttered enoki comes in a little tray that you put right onto the grill and it's a welcome variation from all the dry meat you'll eat.  

Staff are friendly once you're able to get a hold of them, and food arrives pretty quickly with no missed orders - this is always a plus!  Definitely worth a try and great for a cold night!  Note that there's a seating limit of 2 hrs."}
{"text":"Fantastic meat quality and selection. Good service. 

Pricing: Weekday lunch  $18, weekend  $20. 1.5 eating time. $30 weekday dinner and $33 weekend. 2hr eating time.

12% service charge will be added automatically.

Current promotion: 15% off your bill for dinner menu.

Intersection: Steeles/ Woodbine (quite hidden in the plaza)

Serves alcohol such as beer, cocktail, etc. 

The food is surprisingly good in flavour and quality. The bathrooms and dining room area is clean and neat. 

This is AYCE.

The beef brisket, kalbi and pork slection is amazing. Dinner menu does have more choices and you can have that menu during lunch by just paying the price. 

The desert is melona!!! Yummy!!! They have melon/ strawberry/ Mango flavour. 

Their side dishes are okay but the shrimp in their menu is a good deal. It's shell-less Thai style shrimps so the size is good.

Remember to try to cook items with less oil such as vegetables in the middle to avoid big flames that will just end up burning your food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past month and had a positive experience both times.  

The meat quality is consistent and much better than other korean bbqs.  Favourite dishes include: beef rib, pork belly slices, chicken cartilage, enoki mushroom, salmon sashimi, butter corn.  The beef rib is thinly sliced and boneless, easy and quick to cook on the grill.  The pork you can also wrap in lettuce with garlic and sauce.  

The restaurant is clean and modern with great ventilation.  Dinner on the weekends can be pricey, but ordering the weekday dinner menue during lunch with 15% off is a gd deal.  I think the weekend dinner price should include drink (ie: iced tea or plum juice) which it currently doesn't.  Service is better when they are not busy, as the server will come over to teach you how to best cook the meats so it doesnt burn.  

I also like this type of wire net grill better than the cast iron ones as the meat doesn't burn as much and both times I didn't find it neccessary to change the grill.

Dessert could have more variety.  Currently they serve creme brulee and melona popsicles, but something like a shot of mango ice puree or fruit selection would be a nice addition."}
{"text":"The staff here are ridiculous. I called in to make reservations for 5 people. They don't take any reso under 6, which can be understandable. I came in wanting to put my name down at 5:24 for 6PM but the hostess would not let me, so I came back at 6PM. I spoke to someone else and they told me it was a 2 hour wait because I missed the \"first round\". I noticed that the waitlist was extremely long so I asked the girl and she told me that the waitlist opens at 5:30..... 
Note: 6 minute difference. 
Restaurant owners should seriously consider who they hire to work for them because their business goes down because of their workers"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre BBQ place if you ask me. The flavours weren't much different from those I've had at other places, and is even comparable to Chakos... other than the fact that it's pricy af. However, fair in the sense that you can indulge yourself in ample amounts of meat. ($32.99 for the \"holidays\" and weekends, they also include gratuity fees in your bill so no need to worry about tipping)

Went around 8pm tonight with a party of 4 and ended up waiting until around 9:40ish to be seated. The service was decent. Fast-paced workers who try their best to rush you with ordering so that you can leave asap. 

Food-wise, there wasn't a huge selection on the menu but we literally tried almost everything. I found it weird how they had cold noodles, bibimbap, and even Korean ice-cream as dessert at a Japanese BBQ place. I got confused halfway as to whether I was at K-BBQ or J-BBQ. ANYWAYS, I enjoyed their enoki and sweet potato, along with pork belly since I don't see those at AYCE BBQ places often. (I do wish they hadn't marinated it though)

In terms of reservations, they only reserve for parties of 6 people or more. Other than that, you have to walk-in and wait... Expect to wait around an hour or more so prepare to keep yourself busy and kill time!"}
{"text":"Was there last weekend as a group of 11. We made reservations weeks in advance. They weren't able to seat us all in one table so they offered us one large table and another smaller table. Thankfully we had a few young children so we were able to all squeeze into the one large table but it was pretty tight. Service was excellent and food was good. The marinated beef ribs were my favourite. Frankly, one of the best services received from a Chinese establishment. Servers were always smiling and helpful."}
{"text":"Service is horrible! We've booked a table for 6 but last minute my friend couldn't come. So we told them now only 5 ppl..they said then that's a cancellation of a table. You need to put your name down and wait. After we requested to speak with the manager he came and talked to his staff for a good few minutes finally said fine you can sit. After we sat down, our table has two bbq stove and the table was for 6 ppl. They closed one of the stoves because we didn't have 6 ppl we must share and use one. Reminding you this is a table for 6...how can my friend at the end reach? The manager came again and said that's their policy. So we got up and about to leave then he said fine we will open both stove for us. I really don't understand the logic of that!  Food is just typical ayce with more choices of meat...guess it's ok. Don't think I'll go back again!"}
{"text":"Called in a few days ago trying to make a reservation for Fri night. No reservations were available from 6:30-8pm, first come first serve basis. 

Was told 1 hour wait when I arrived at 6:30pm, table for 4. But somehow we ended up with a table in 15min wait. My server was very tentative, detail oriented and gave good recommendations. Food came out in the speed of light after order went in electronically. 

Their meat and vegetables was definitely better grade than \"Korean bbq\" restaurants. BUT also definitely not 100% Japanese barbecue as they claim they are. Nothing comparable to Japan or Japanese grill. Most importantly, their menu and flavor was Korean fusion. Like \"Kalbi\", lettuce wrap, Korean cold noodles, bibimbap, kimchi appetizer and serving Korean popsicle. 

I do like their pork jowl (pork cheek) with lettuce wrap + garlic + korean hot sauce (they offered me, but you can also ask if your server didn't give it to you). I liked their gyutan [??? ] (beef tongue) as they came in thinly sliced; After grilling they were very bouncy, crispy, chewy... a word I don't know how to describe. (I liked my gyutan half cooked because fully cook would lost all the moisture and juice to it making it like jerky)

Overall they were okay, busy place full of Asians, restaurant doesn't have a lot of tables. Worth a try, photo worthy."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, more on the pricey side though. We loved the pork belly. Try to make a reservation or you'd have to wait for a while.

Extra star for the great service though. Our server David was super efficient and helpful and kept helping us cook ( because we were clearly failing) thanks David! :)"}
{"text":"This is a good spot for a friend reunion party or someone really love meat~ the marinated short ribs are my fav. Be careful about the time limit when you went in a group."}
{"text":"Had the worst service here...the server kept almost like a countdown of how many minutes we had left, and kept forgetting our orders. He even rushed our desserts (melona bars) and left them all melting on our table when \"our time was almost up\". I ate my melona bar quickly and didn't even get to finish it. Very rude, and I did not feel relaxed eating here. I did enjoy the food, just not the service. This was in the summer time. Some of my friends went again and told me the service has changed now. So I will probably go back once more since I love Japanese BBQ. Hopefully no one rushes us again"}
{"text":"A Japanese style ayce meat buffet!  Who would've thought that this oddly named meat factory would be nestled in between a bunch of business offices? The smells of bbq meats undoubtedly had bought production down in the building.  Good luck trying to find a parking spot. And with that said, all the cons have been discussed.  Seriously.  The food is excellently prepared, the meat well marinated, and there is even a large waiting room because they know people are going to wait.

I lied; I have one more con- they included a 12% tip on my party of (just) two.  Usually this is just reserved for larger parties so I thought it was odd.  I actually would've tipped them more as they constantly changed the grill, refilled our drinks, cleared out plates, etc. While they deserved it, the notion of mandatory tipping leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth.

If you want a high quality experience for AYCE DIY Asian bbq meats I have no hesitation to recommend this place.

HLIW (how long I'd wait): 45 min (including finding parking)"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner - they did not take reservation as it was just the 2 of us.
We waited for about 40 mins on a Thursday night.
Service was ok, food was ok... No much difference from your usual ayce bbq.
The beef though i have to say was pretty good and fresh especially the boneless kalbi beef.
The meat is chopped into very small pieces which makes it easier to cook i guess.

They allow only 2 hours seating - and it begins the moment you sit down. They will come let you know when you have about 20 mins left.

Overall it was an ok experience- don't think I would crave to come back again.

Some good choices on the menu are:
Boneless Kalbi beef
Kalbi beef
Chicken knee
Enoki mushroom

This place is good for you if you like alot of meat!"}
{"text":"I have not been to this place but I already had a bad impression. We booked the table 1 week ahead of time and everything was okay. HOWEVER they called on the day of and informed us that they would charge us holiday price all of a sudden."}
{"text":"Been here a few times - mostly as a large group for birthday celebrations

Tip - they don't take reservations for a party less than 4.  Wait times can be long (1.5 hr!), so better come in as a big group or go out of busy hours.
Also, no credit cards!  Bring cash/debit!


Location/Service:
It's located literally right out of the highway exit, but it's hidden in a small plaza.  Parking gets full quickly, so best to carpool.

Interior is modern with a few Japanese themed designs like movie posters and drawings.  They play Japanese music as well to fit in the mood.

All staff I've experience have very courtesy service - they make sure plates are taken away, orders are all filled and even come to your table to advise how to cook your food.  Don't be hesitate to ask for assistance or clarify what you don't get in the menu, they are more than happy to help!


Food:
The grill differs from other places, where it's a net is used instead of metal plate.  I find that easier to handle and not as sticky.

Now, this is all you can eat - so please try everything at least once!

I really like their vegetable dishes - sweet potato, enoki mushrooms that are serve on a small plate and you just let it sit over the fire.

Kabli short ribs and beef brisket are also an excellent choice; grills fast and meat is tender.  Servers ask you the portion you want, so eat accordingly to your tasting.

I also like their bimbimbap - and the portion is not to overwhelming.  I usually even add some of the grilled meat/veggies into it to make it to my own tasting.

The cold noodles, however, I don't highly recommend it as the portion is very small and the taste is a little bland.

As for desserts, they've changed a little over the few times I went there.
Before it was all you can eat Melona (so good!), but now it's restricted and they've switched brands too.  Nonetheless, a little sweet to finish the meal adds a satisfying taste to it.
They also have creme brulee which is worth to try.

Pricing is close to ~$40 and a little pricer on Friday/Weekend/Holidays. 
I wouldn't mind coming in for a try and if you like it, come back often (probably during weeknights!)"}
{"text":"Gyubee advertises itself as a Japanese Bbq joint, but from the menu, you get more of a korean vibe: kimchi, ssamjang, garlic, bibimbap...and no udon or more traditional Japanese dishes?

The good:
Service here is really good which is nice for am extremely busy place. 

Lunch option is also pretty good, at 20$ you pretty much get your favs from the dinner menu...trust me, the extras during dinner arent really worth in my opinion.

Restaurant is also kept pretty clean and the dishes / meats come quick!


The Bad: 
kimchi. Just TERRIBLE. no dancing around this one.

Pork belly? more like bacon...it was that thin.

If they want to identify as a korean restaurant, a fermented soybean paste soup is a must pairing with bbq dishes...if not, then at least offer some udon to cleanse the pallet a bit after all the heavy meat!

Verdict: for the price point, average wait times and selection, I wouldn't say this place is a must. If you're dying for kbbq ayce (which is ironic cuz this is supposed to be japanese..), and in the area, I recommend lunch only, and just keep it simple, a little beef brisket, more Galbi, lettuce mushrooms and you can have a decent meal.

PROTIP#1: Grill your pork first, so the beef meats get extra bacony flavour!

PROTIP#2: order some mushrooms, place garlic in the mushrooms and add beef on top with ssamjang for a tasty flavor bomb!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesn't have a better rating but I was blown away!

Ok, this IS my first time trying jbbq as I've always done kbbq instead. But I must say...I have been exposed to another LOVELY goodness thanks to my friend!!! This IS WAAAY better than kbbq for so many reasons! There's not that much steam in your face so you won't smell like bbq, WAAAY less chance to get oil splattered on you as you cook (maybe just the flames ;P) and the meat is just SO MUCH BETTER! The only downside I have to memtion is that they have a time limit as to how long you can order/eat there. Regardless I will still give this place a super thumbs up for food and service! Anyway let's move on to the actual review instead of raving about my personal thoughts!

Came here for lunch with a few friends and it wasn't too busy because it was right when they opened (of course ;P). The food options had enough variety with a few different additions than your typical kbbq menu. They had bibimbap that came in small bowls so you could say it was like a mini bibimbap you were having. They also had pork belly which was GOOOOLDEN for me as I missed pork belly sooo much since my all time favourite kbbq restaurant, Seoul, closed down. Not many kbbq places that I've been have pork belly as an option in ayce...And finally, they had their wonderful MELONA dessert popsicle!! It was also my first time having it because I skipped out on a previous opportunity to try it out. I now regret that horribly! Service was great! Waiters were friendly, polite and patient while taking our orders. Place was also pretty clean too including their washrooms despite what I read. I like the layout/design of the restaurant too.

Now that I have been exposed to jbbq and discovered this wonderful place I will definitely be back for round 2 and more! I'm also going to be on the hunt for other jbbq locations! Jbbq here I come!"}
{"text":"The food was good for the most part. But much could be improved for the service part of the experience. The waiter (a fat Korean guy) was not attentive and he often ignored us when we  tried to wave him down and the restaurant was not busy. He would look at us and then look away without attending to another table."}
{"text":"One of my friends from college really wanted to try this place out since she was uptown.  It was around 7:30 when we arrived at Gyubee, and we were told it would be an one hour wait.  I was like, \"holy molly, i am so freaking hungry.\"  I asked whether we can go somewhere else, but she was adamant this place is amazing, so I succumbed under peer pressure.  

We went shopping for a bit before returning, and our table is still not available until 30 minutes later.  So, by now, I am super dupper hungry.  This place has to be good to justify a long wait.  

By the time we sat down, we were greeted by someone who was friendly, quick and professional.  She was really thorough in pointing out how to cook the various cut of beef properly, and slice of pork belly, shrimp, squid, and chicken slices.  The sauce was really tasty with a slight hint of wasabi which complement the meat perfectly and the spice powder was really flavourful also.  The grilled beef tongue was really good but were sliced too thin.  I actually loved the chewiness texture of the beef tongue.   

The grills were changed really frequently at first, by the time it reached the last call (1hour 40minutes) into the services, we were going at lightning speed so we can finiah eating within the two hours limit.  The servers rushed us so much that I was on the point that I almost got pissed off since the server underestimated our eating ability.  We stayed another extra ten minutes to finish all the food and all cleaned.  The server was a little surpise that we finish table full of food in less than 15 minutes.  I think that was my highlight.  On a side note, I hope they can keep their washrooms cleaner in the future."}
{"text":"Very good qualities for the Beef and Pork, incredible service, nice and friendly. The only thing I want to complain is.....wait almost 40 mins on Friday night!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Their selection for dinner was amazing. My favourite was the Kalbi beef. All the pieces of meat were cut thinly and it's so easy to cook. Definitely a great experience. The only thing I would mention is that they have a 2 hour seating limit from the time you sit down. It is a bit more pricey at $30 per person for dinner. But I enjoyed it and would definitely return! Yum"}
{"text":"Good food and i always come, but the asian man with the short hair and the tattoo/sleeve on his left arm has the worst attitude i have ever seen in my life. He needs a good talking to."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. Does not take reservations for peak hours 6-9. I waited 1.5 hours for a table of 4. There was a large wait room, not sure if they restaurant couldn't pass fire inspection that's why they didn't have tables there. Food wise was good but seem like Korean bbq more. Order cocktails Ume pineapple and lychee Mojito, did not taste any alcohol in there. Probably why they only charge 3.50. They are really strict on the 2 hour seating limit. Once you are seated the staff writes down your time and tell you when you last call is. FYI this last call includes dessert, which is only creme brûlée. They do give one melona per customer. Choice of honeydew or strawberry."}
{"text":"False advertising. The 10% listed on Yelp does not exist as proclaimed by the server. We were given a choice of lunch or dinner menu during lunch time. Dinner menu was 10% off but it has nothing to do with the Yelp special.
10% Off was not applied to lunch menu either. I had gone with the lunch menu instead.

The service was great. A little too efficient as they took away dishes we were using to put cooked food on, or for garbage like shrimp tails, faster than we can say no. 

Meat quality is pretty good and fresh. 

Their Bibimbap is a little too saucy as the entire bowl was doused in sauce. Definitely go for the meat. We just kept on piling kalbi and beef brisket."}
{"text":"The quality of the meat is great. The meat are all fresh and well-marinated. The other sides like rice and noodles are in small portion, which is great as I got to try more things without wasting. The servers checked our griller to make sure nothing is burned. However, they missed our order for like 3 times. I understand the kitchen is busy but I really don't like to ask servers to do extra unnecessary things. And it's kind of frustrating that you are in a position that you don't want to wait but you don't want to order again in case of ending up to have double orders. And as the other reviews mentioned, probably in order to control the portion, the meat are very thin-cut. For things like beef tongue, thick-cut is always better."}
{"text":"Definitely not coming back. Also, BEWARE, WATERMELON POPSICLE HAS PEANUTS!

So...this place. Came here last night for dinner. A whopping $30 for AYCE Japanese BBQ. Better be good right? First off, their seating rules are VERY STRICT. Some of us came earlier than others and were told that the 2 hour seating limit starts RIGHT from the moment we sit down. Kinda pissed me off. So we went into the little \"waiting room\" (bunch of old tables and seats from the old sushi place) to wait for the others. We were seated, received the menu and started reading away. Tea costs $1 per person. Hmm. Stuck with water and a pitcher of plum juice.

Starting off with the meat. Everything was okay. There's not much to say really. It's a thick sauce on all of the meats, and the meat will grill very fast just a heads up. The chicken is also pretty bad. Bunch of bones and small little niblets. The mushroom were placed in a cute little foil container (the egg tart ones) but it didn't make it taste better lololol. The sausages were pretty good though. Very juicy on the inside. Not even lying right now, but the highlight of the meal was the steamed rice. It helped make me full because I didn't really want to eat much of the other stuff (exception of the sausages :D). 

On to service. Not good at all. There was one that gave us attitude when we asked if there were seats in the back (there weren't). Jeeez! Our main waiter was okay. Kept on making jokes about how many of each we wanted. \"10? 20? 30? 300?\" Yea funny the first time. Irritating every other time. He also spilled some of that disgusting meat juice at the bottom of the finished plates right on my arm. He didn't even notice. Then proceeded to drop 3 bowls on the ground spilling a bit of miso soup on my seat. Luckily it was finished bowls so not that much spilled (AND that he noticed it LOL). Then the flame of the grill was getting really high and strong so we asked if we can put it to low or something. Turns out the grill itself caught on fire so he needed to pour some water to put it out. Another 5-10 minutes with that and it was ticking our 2 hour limit :(. 

Last call cause time was up, so I ordered a Watermelon \"Melona\" Popsicle as it says on the menu. Got played again...it's not Melona. Some chinese brand that tried to look like Melona. Please don't put \"Melona\" on the menu if it really isn't. It's like putting Coca Cola on the menu then serving us No-Name brand Cola. Here's the bad part. I'm allergic to peanuts. As I'm eating I realize that the little seeds that make it look like a watermelon are peanuts. All the waiter could say was oh sorry about that! With how many people are allergic to peanuts, I do think that the waiters should warn people when ordering it. Then got an allergic reaction and needed to go to the emergency room. Sigh.

Service was horrible, food was okay at best, strict seating times and cheap chinese popsicles. Don't recommend to anyone even if you don't have a peanut allergy. Very disappointing that they charge $30 too."}
{"text":"3.5/5
I'd say the food quality is better than the average kbbq like Korean Grill House or Chako, but not amazing. Lots of different cuts of meat to choose from but nothing tasted overly spectacular. You can ask for a taster plate with a bit of everything and go from there. The grill was a little sticky to work with and made it difficult to cook the thin slices of meats. They do provide lettuce and garlic if you want to go the tradition korean bbq route and make those wraps :)

Aside from the meats, you could order Bibimbaps, which were surprisingly good for a AYCE place! Not cooked in a stone pot or anything but good sampler portion and a good proportion of different veggies topped with an over medium egg. 

Costs around $40 - If you come before 5:30pm/9pm, there's an additional 10% off! Cash and debit only. There's also a 2 hour seating limit, but doubt they'd kick you out :P"}
{"text":"Nothing special IMO just another BBQ place, price is a bit steep for what you get. If you like mushrooms then definitely come here. Infinite enoki shrooms so you can eat till you drop.  Aside from that the quality of the beef was quite good, better than korean grill house where everything tastes the same.  The pork wasn't that great, it was cut too thinly."}
{"text":"I love myself some barbecue and I have to say that this one wasn't that bad. I agree with many of the other reviews that the food was similar to Korean barbecue, but it was still quite good.

The space seemed a bit odd with tables going around the perimeter, but there did seem to be enough tables for enough people. The cooking tops were awesome though, as they used the grills rather than the plates. It made cooking much easier, as the food didn't stick as much. It was also a lot more fun when the flames were came up too. 

The dinner AYCE was a little expensive, as it was $30 for a weeknight, but the food quality was much better, which made it a little better. There was Beef Ribs, Pork Belly, and Chicken Cartilage. They were all quite good quality meats as well, which made the price more justifiable. They also provided AYCE Bibimbap and Cold Noodles, which was amazing!

The service was quite fast, as all orders were put in via an iPad, which had the food come out almost instantly. The odd thing was that they asked you to order by piece, rather than plate. That means that one order of beef ribs is literally one little square. Unfortunately, there only seemed to be one guy that took orders but an unlimited amount of staff that to bring you food and take empty dishes. 

Overall, a decent meal but a little overpriced. Not sure if this was allowed, but they did charge us controlled gratuity on our final bill, after the tax... Not too sure what happened there, but it was a little odd. Would probably come again, but not on the regular."}
{"text":"Good quality beef. After the first order, we ended up ordering the beef short rib round after round, along with other things. In a way, it's is good because the short rib was so fat and tender. In a way, it's bad because there wasn't really any other items that were really good. Bibimbap was also good. Other things were good too.

They call it a Japanese bbq, but it's mainly a repurposed korean bbq place. They serve miso soup, edamame, and salmon carpaccio, and a Japanese style grill. That's about it.

At the end when we paid, I asked the guy why they didn't have lamb. He asked \"you want lamb?\" which gave me the impression that this topic was never brought up before. I told them chako had lamb. He was also surprised by that fact. After looking it up, chako only has lamb for weekend dinner.

Food was good, but I gotta say it's too expensive for an ayce bbq place. Chako weekend dinner is 24.99 vs Gyubee's 32.99. Gyubee's food was good, but not THAT good. If the price was around Chako's price, I'd give it 4 a higher rating. Also bottomless softdrinks were 2 dollars. Also considering weekend dinner has nothing extra, I recommend coming during the weekdays (if at all. Or just go to chako for a slightly better item variety and cheaper price).

Also dessert was the melona ice cream bar. I asked for two, but they said one per person. In most other places I've been, dessert have been all you can eat also. 

Service was quick for most parts. Soft drinks were refilled more often than I was finishing them, which was a plus. I would have given 8/10 for service, but here are the bad. They did add a 12% service fee without telling us (well I do realize it's in small print on the menu, fine). I asked them whether it was added already when we went out to pay. At that moment, I only knew because my friend read about it on yelp and said it would be added already. 

Upon reading other yelp reviews, I just realized that they also enforced the 2 hours seating limit even when there were other empty tables. My understanding and experience for nearly all other ayce places is that they enforce the 2 hour seating limit when they are full house. When they're not full house, they usually just let you sit and eat for as long as you want. Not so in this place.

Good food but price exceeds its value, considering the alternatives available. Fast service but the assumed service fee, strictly enforced 2 hour seating limit, and not ayce dessert left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't think I'll be coming back.

Quality: 8/10. Value: 4/10. Service: 6/10. Overall 6/10."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 7 on a Sunday afternoon. For 19.99, you have several food items to choose from and you certainly will leave feeling full! The favourite was the kalbi. The marinate was heavenly. Try the bimbibop too! Loved that they have lettuce for lettuce wraps and melona bars for dessert (1 per person only though). In my opinion this trumps other kbbq places and has a similar vibe. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Food: 10/10 -- Value: 7/10 -- Service: 9/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 8/10

Would I come again? On a special occasion or after fasting for three years. Definitely not often.

Standouts:
------------
- enoki mushrooms (comes in a tin pan with butter!)
- crème brûlée (even if it isn't fully realized or authentic, it tastes great!)
- bibimbap (doesn't come with meat, but there's plenty of meat on the menu you can add to it)

Pros:
------------
- great selection and quality of meats and vegetables
- quick and proactive service; replaced grills several times without being asked
- free drink with coupon from an Asian magazine/newspaper included pop and cocktails (non-alcoholic)
- accurate order management (you know, when you order 10, they give you 10 instead of what other ayce places do, which is subtract arbitrary amounts from your order) 

Cons:
------------
- Price. After tax and tip, it comes to ~$41 on a weekend, which is A LOT. Yes, there are more options and better quality of things to order than the typical Korean BBQ restaurant, but this is really up there in price.
- Service...near the end. The waitress with a ponytail and star tattoos on her arm stood next to our table looking at her watch as we approached the end of our two-hour seating limit. This was constant in the last 15 minutes, which was unnerving and in my opinion, unprofessional.
- Respect for your reservation. When the reservation was made, we explicitly told them that we needed enough seating for a total group of 19 people that would be further divided into one group of seven and another group of 12. If you look around the restaurant, their booths and tables each have two grills and are designed to seat six people. However, they put our group of seven at a booth, which was fine, but they put the group of 12 at an equally size booth, which was ridiculous. Not only did they have to pull so many chairs up to the booth just so people could be seated, but 12 people had to share two grills. In what universe does that make sense? They could have easily put us in a row of tables instead of booths, but whoever was planning or took the reservation clearly didn't care."}
{"text":"This was our second time having family dinner here, the line up was 2 hours however it's worth the wait..it could be better if they accept reservation. Food and service was great. Pricing is also good."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants hands down. I love the fresh meats and veggies that they serve. Their menu is big and has many options. I would love to see more seafood options though. The service here is always great. I prefer coming here than going to any other kind of BBQ place. It gets tough finding a table during dinner time though. You can't make reservations unless you're a party of 6 or more. The wait times get crazy long, so plan ahead! Other than that, a 10/10 for sure for this place."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, considering the price is definitely on the higher end. The food itself was amazing quality, but the service left something to desire. My party had an empty table for a good ten minutes before our orders came out. Pretty unfair if you consider the place is all you can eat - with a time restriction. The waiters looked annoyed whenever we asked for more food, but never brought the quantity that we asked for either. 

Overall, I had an okay experience. The location is convenient, the atmosphere is nice, and the ingredients are amazing. However, the customer service highlights the overpriced, \"trendy\" nature of the restaurant. In my opinion, there are other authentic BBQ places that provide a better value. As of now, I am hesitant to return to Gyubee."}
{"text":"Since starting to come here service has greatly improved ! 

As usual they've got a long lineup most days however we get lucky to only wait maybe 20 minutes for a table or even no wait at all if you come during 1 to 3pm time. Plus that's when they give 10% off your bill.

We eat here quite often for the all you can eat Boneless Kalbi. Which is the super nicely marbled thin slice Beef !

The marinated Kalbi also a favourite because of  they remove the bone already for you ! 

Shrimp is peeled already too ! Easy and simple dining experience.

Our favourite is to use the Leafy greens to wrap the BBQ meat with and fresh garlic slices. 

Highlights is their great selection of side dishes ! Offering a nice BiBimBap, Thinly Sliced Cabbage salad, Butter/Honey Enoki Mushrooms, Honey/Butter Sweet potatoes and Cold Noodles. 

Their Lychee Mojito as a virgin drink is divine! So refreshing and thirst quenching !

Reccomend this to anyone who good value and quality!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here and the food is very good.  It may seem pricing for lunch ($21.99) but the selection is perfect.  They even have bibimbap!  
The service is good, the place is clean and the food is very tasty.  The meat is well seasoned and tender.  
The only downfall is they only take cash or debit.  
Other than that, this AYCE joint is a must if you have not yet tried Japanese BBQ."}
{"text":"Very good taste , beef ribs and pork was really good. Overall the food is good, but once you sit down they will start the count down. 
This is really bad, feels like they don't want you to stay , just finish everything and go away....
Recommend for people first time try, and for people who eat really fast."}
{"text":"Definitely an upgrade from your typical Chakos/KBBQ kind of experience! While it is notably more pricey, you do have a wide range of meats, vegetables, and side dishes to choose from. I would highly recommend the enoki mushroom and honey potatoes, which come in little aluminum tins that cook on the grill. As well, the cuts of meat and portions are quite good. As for dessert, you do get to choose a Melona, and I would also recommend the creme brulee. They do strictly enforce the two hour seat time, and they do tend to get quite busy around 6 pm, so do plan accordingly. The service was quite good, with waiters always there to top off drinks, place our reorders, and to change grills. Would recommend trying this establishment at least once!"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 (Average AYCE BBQ lean to Korean/ Asian Style) 
Service: 4/5 (our waiter is very helpful and friendly)
Note: *12% gratuity will be added to your bill. Seating limit is 2 hours. 

Mon- Thurs: Lunch: $19.99 & Dinner: $30.99 
Fri- Sun, Holiday: Lunch: $21.99 &  Dinner: $33.99

We visited here several times. Recently visited, the service was big improvement (our waiter is very attentive).  The place is always busy and wait time is usually between 2-3 hours.  We came here on weekday before 5:30pm to avoid the crowd and also offered 10% discount (yikes :P).
It's AYCE, menu is simple and focus (Beef, Chicken, Pork, Vegetables and other side dish like appetizer, soup, rice and noodles), So we ordered little of everything.  Food was average, but the Kalbi Boneless short-rib was well marbled, looked beautiful on the grill and tasted GREAT.
Their bibimbap and cold noodle were also a great accompaniment to all the meat. 
Overall, there isn't enough value to justify regular visits.  If you are meat lover with big stomach, It would worth your visit."}
{"text":"TBH this is one of the best barbecue place in Toronto. Happened to be here for a meal because a friend suggested it. The meat is fresh, at least for my visit I can guarantee that. The service was terrific, seriously , staff was patient and had a positive attitude, they always have recommendation and one staff was even detailed enough to offer is an exchange of meat because it had too much fat, really impressed. 
The price may be a bit higher than other bbq places, but for the quality and service, I'm willing to pay that extra , if I spend money for a meal I would like to enjoy it.
The experience was excellent"}
{"text":"WOW. If you like beef (or pork), this is the place to be.  Came here on a Thursday night and they were packed! They have 2 seatings, 6:30pm and 8:30pm. Last call is 20 minutes before your 2 hour seating limit and they are very strict about this.

Tons of servers around to takw your order and the food comes out pretty quickly.  Oh speaking of food, it's awesome!  Their kalbi boneless short ribs are amazing. The marbling on the beef is ridiculous, especially for an all you can eat restaurant.  Their pork belly was also very good!  If you enjoy table side Korean BBQ, you've gotta try this place!  It's a tad pricey at $29.99 plus 12% service charge and tax for weeknights, but it's well worth it!

To end, amazing food and great service!  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for at least an hour! you can only book a table only if you have 6+ people. I got there at 7pm waited until 8pm to be seated, they like to kinda rush you.... they're always coming around and watching your table asking if you want to order more. The meats are good its all small slices/pieces! so you'll finish it fast, i like how you get mini bibimbap and the seasoning powder that comes with your soy sauce those are pretty bomb. Overall i got a food coma from it so thats good, it's good but NOT worth the price...."}
{"text":"I enjoyed our time here! But came away so full, as I usually do with all you can eats.

3/5 - Service
The service was good. The servers were quick to take our orders. Our server was friendly and everything we ordered came out really quickly.  Unfortunately, the wait to get seated if you come after 5:30pm on Friday or the weekend, and have less than 6 people is about 1 to 2 hours if you come past 6:30 pm. So if you have less than 6 people don't go on weekend as the place gets rammed.

4/5 - Food 
The meat quality is definitely better than your average BBQ place. My favourite cuts of meat were the chicken cartilage, the marinated short rib, tongue, and pork cheek. You can see the marbling of fat in the meat, that gives the meat a bit of richness and makes the meat really tender. The meat was also delicious and tasted great. They also offer seafood in the form of squid and shrimp. There is an assortment of veggies including: corn, king oyster mushrooms, button mushrooms, sweet potato,  zucchini, asparagus, enokkki mushrooms in this amazing butter garlic sauce. The only thing I didn't like was the sweet potato that comes in a honey sauce, that made it too sweet. They have a variety of appetizers to choose from as well. We ordered the kimchi, cold tofu, and cabbage salad. As well as your standard Miso soup. You can also order some side dishes including lettuce for the meat, bibimpap, cold noodles, and steamed rice. We tried both the bibimpap and the cold noodles, which were both pretty good. The portions are on the smaller side so you don't have to worry about not having enough room for meat. For dessert they offer crème brule, which was nice and creamy and Melona's bars. I love that they also replace your grill when it gets too charred. 

Décor - 3/5
Looks like a typical BBQ place with black furniture and red walls. They do have some interesting cartoon images on the wall. And the biggest fire extinguishers I've ever seen. 

If you love meat I would recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Although the wait time was ridiculously long (1.5-2 hours), my overall dining experience was a full 5 out of 5 stars! 

Food Quality: YUM, everything was so fresh and delicious! The marbling on the short rib was very impressive and the clams were a very nice addition to the menu.

My favourite orders were:
1) Kalbi Boneless Short Rib = perfectly marbled and thinly sliced, these were by far the EASIEST to cook without flares of fire or burnt meat 
2) House Marinated Kalbi Short Rib = marinated in a delicious sauce and served as a thicker cut, this one was juicy and had more of a mouthfeel 
3) Miso Beef Brisket = also marinated but in a different sauce, this one tended to be a fattier cut and burnt more easily. While it was delicious, I found it very difficult to cook because the fat oils dripping into the fire would feed the flames and make it overbearingly hot.

Food Variety: Gyubee has so much more variety than the other BBQs that I've been to - from the beef, chicken, pork, and seafood selections to the vegetables and side dishes, you really get a well-rounded meal. I particularly enjoyed the creme brulee and melona bar at the end, which was a refreshing change from ice cream. 

Service: 10/10! Our waiter was exceptional and checked in on us frequently throughout the meal to see if we needed any assistance. He even stood there and helped us to cook some of our meat when the fire got too intense! He was courteous and very helpful. Tip was already included in the bill but we tipped him extra afterwards. 

I would highly recommend you try this place out if you haven't been! 
TIP: They don't take reservations but if you drop by and leave your name for the waitlist, they give you a pretty good estimation and you can leave to go play darts at iDarts down the street before coming back in time for dinner!"}
{"text":"Not the best.

It was not amazing and it wasn't awful. The food was mediocre. It was not anything new and pretty standard. They kept rushing me to leave which I did not appreciate."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Japanese BBQ I've had. The marinated meat are full of flavours. Once you try this place, you'll never want that ayce Korean BBQ again. The staff here are also very friendly!!"}
{"text":"I took my family to this newly open Japanese style BBQ restaurant to celebrate my brothers birthday. I did make a reservation three days ago.

The decor is simple modern style with some hot Japanese series posters on the wall. All the servers are in uniform and smile all the time.

Although coming in the lunch time we choose the dinner menu with more meat options. They have two kinds of short rib:marinated or boneless. Most of the time I prefer marinated but this time Kalbi Boneless short rib wins. It is in a thick rectangle cube and the marbling is so beautiful. 
I think meat lover will definitely like here."}
{"text":"Great experience and price... enjoyed every slice i tasted. It is a hidden gem outside of toronto. I would highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I had a date night with Hubby here,  hoping to recreate our Japanese BBQ experience when we were in Japan.   

Gyubee had great service and very friendly staff.  The wait staff were very attentive, so much that we never had an empty plate sit longer than 1 minute at our table.  Their was always someone walking by our table checking up on us to see if we needed to add to our order and assuring us if everything was okay.  He even helped us use the ice cubes to put out the flare ups on the grill.  At one point, another staff member helped us cook the beef and vegetables.  He offered some great advice on how to grill the meats and vegetables.  I did not know you had to grill the white button mushroom, cap side down, so that the mushroom juices will form when it is cooked.  We know how to BBQ our food, but we weren't going to turn away service like that.

We did try everything on the AYCE menu.  As for the meats, definitely get the chicken thigh, pork shoulder, pork belly, beef tongue, beef brisket, squid, and shrimps. However, the best meat to order would be the marinated Kalbi short ribs - they are all boneless and you'll have to order by slices.  We ordered all the meats in increments of 8 slices each time.  The Enoki mushroom was also very tasty, it comes in a small round aluminum foil tart pan with a brown sugar and butter sauce that you place directly over the grill. When the sauce starts to bubble, you'll know it's done.   I also tried the Frozen mint Yuzu slush and it was amazing, not watered down liquor at all.

As for the 2 hr. limit, we had no issue eating a nice full meal, but it might be a bit more challenging for larger groups.  I think they impose the 2 hr limit because the parking surrounding the restaurant is all labeled as \"Visitor parking - max. 2 hr. limit\".  The restaurant is located on the lower ground level of an office building.

Best time to come would be on a weeknight as the dinner price is slightly cheaper at $29.99/pp as oppose to $32.99/pp for the exact same menu, plus no waiting for a table.   They also don't take reservations unless you have 6 or more people in your party."}
{"text":"Staff told us the wait was an hour, ended up waiting for two and a half hour, extreme waste of time and money , irresponsible servants, food is mediocre"}
{"text":"This review is based on my second visit which was for dinner today. The first time was a year ago and I must say; it's not what I remembered it to be.

First of all, they removed the salmon sashimi off the menu (that was one of my favourites). Secondly, the servers seemed a bit bossy and rude.
I'm sorry, but I don't need to be taught how to cook my own food- thank you very much!
It wasn't like it was a suggestion that I should do this or that. It was more like: Don't do that...Do this! They were hovering over our shoulders watching us cook our food.

Anyway, the wait for seating was horrendous. The food order was cut in half when brought to the table. But at least the food did not disappoint. Servers rush us out as soon as time was up. 

Was better when the business was new. Now not so much."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, pros are the good food and fantastic service, con is the wait time. (Keep reading for more information)  

For a Tuesday night at 8pm, it was busy (around an hr wait for a table for 2). They do have a large waiting area with a water dispenser and also free wifi so it wasn't as bad. I don't think it's necessarily the type of place to be a go-to just because of the wait time but I will definitely be back. They also don't take down your phone number and call when the table is ready. They expect you to be in the waiting room when they just call your name. 

The servers were very attentive and would come around and help you if they see that you're struggling to work the fire and teach you how to cook the meat properly. They'd also offer suggestions to pair the food so that it wasn't just meat overload. One of the servers even came back to give us another pair of tongs to help us grab and cook the meat better. The only things were that our drinks were forgotten and I wish they would've told us which meat was which when bringing the food. They also put a 12% automatic tip but IMO they deserve more than that. 

For the food, it is so much better in quality compared to Chako or Korean Grill House. Their grills were also nice and thin so that nothing really stuck. None of the meats were chewy, they were nice and soft and you don't have to deal with bones for the short ribs which is a definite bonus. Most of the flavours did taste relatively the same to me so I couldn't really differentiate it but it was nonetheless good."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.. 

Hit or miss whenever or not you're gonna have to wait over a hour or be seated right away ... which only happened after 9PM. Reservations are restricted to larger groups I believe 6+ which makes it annoying when you want to come here for dinner with a couple friends. 

Food is good! The prices are higher than pretty much all their competitors but the quality of the meat is also at a higher standard and they also have a wider variety of proteins AND side dishes to choose from. I personally enjoy the marinated short rib the most. Portions are confusing and I have no idea how much to order so I just let the server decide usually lol. Melona at the end is nice but you're limited to one :( ...

Service is pretty mediocre considering the amount of staff they have usually, I would have to flag down a server for every single thing that I need, I think the only time they came on their own was to tell us that we were pretty close to our 2-hour mark indicating us to make our last order lol. A lot of things are forgotten to the point where I asked one server for something and immediately asked
another one for the same thing just in hopes to receive one at all. 

The restaurant is super crammed as they try and accommodate everyone, making the lay out pretty pitch, I mean I'm literally seeing beside another table and the only thing dividing us is a piece of wood which they remove when it's a larger party. You're not going to walk into anyone or ask them to move but you might make a new friend with the party beside you. 

Overall the food is good but the seating is a little awkward the wait could be long during peak dinner service and the service is choppy. I would come back 100% knowing all these factors but if I had a plan b I wouldn't hesitate to leave if I know it's gonna be a long wait."}
{"text":"This gets my vote for the best AYCE BBQ in the GTA now. I usually frown upon \"fake\" Japanese places owned by Chinese. While it is run by Chinese, I would say they have done a very good job to mimic the style. They play Japanese pop songs and put Japanese posters and pictures on the wall. Looks nice!

Food: 
The meats are cut into very small pieces, which is something I like because it cooks really fast and you don't have to worry if the center is ready. The quality of short ribs is definitely a step up from Chako and of course Korean Grill House. There is some nice marbling that is visible on the meat. The meat is so tender and I really like that it's lightly seasoned, unlike Chako/KGH which is swimming in sauce to compensate for the quality of meats. Good cuts of beef don't need much seasoning! And I love how the shrimps are peeled! Easy to eat!

The honey sweet potato is a must try! All the other veggies were meh as they are pretty dry and bland for BBQing but I can let that slide since I came for meat. The \"beef brisket\" was more like bulgogi. Not too special. I don't recommend the chicken. The few appetizers were just ok. I don't recommend the bibimbap as they don't even serve it with pepper sauce. And the portion is somewhat large and I feel it doesn't fit well into their menu. Cold noodle is just \"ok\". 

At the end you can get creme brulee and a melona bar. Unique choices! I would love to have ice cream though but again, not a big deal for me.

Service:
For once I feel a Chinese run place has provided good service. Although obviously not native Japanese speakers, the staff will welcome you in Japanese. The server we had was attentive and helped to make sure we were cooking alright. I really appreciate the efforts. I read some bad reviews about service. I guess it depends on your server.

Price: It's $30 PP on weekday and +$3 on weekends, which is significantly higher than other AYCE options. But well worth it. Will be back."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, I've always wanted to check out this place as I've heard good reviews about it. Definitely beats a lot of AYCE BBQ places out there. The beef was tender and delicious and they have a good variety of foods on their menus. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came for the first time on a Friday night with the fiancé - The wait was approximately an hour but they have a waiting room which was okay (although they could use more chairs). Service was efficient and friendly. However, I find the food quality not worth the price you pay. No matter how great the quality the meat is, when the meat is sliced extremely thin, the texture, the chew, its all gone. The meat I recommend to order is the boneless kalbi and the chicken knee cartilage. The dessert was my favorite part - strawberry and mango melona bar. However, I was really disappointed with the creme brulee.. With the price we pay, only two choices for dessert, I wished it was made better. I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon... This place was definitely over rated..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I've been pretty satisfied with their food. I think their meat quality and overall ingredients is quite fresh. Sometimes when you have ayce not everything tastes good, but their sides are very decent! I especially enjoy their cold noodles, very refreshing after the hot bbq. They are a bit pricey so I suggest coming on the weekday before 5:30 (get 10% off)"}
{"text":"We came for dinner at 6.30pm on a Friday night, having reserved a table prior.  We were a party of 6, including my 3 kids.  My kids are 14, 11 and 10(as of todays date) but this stupid restaurant also imposes a height restriction, to be classed as a child. This may be ok for your average short Chinese family but my family are pretty big and tall. My 11 year old daughter is taller than me, and I'm 5' 5\". So we said we were a party of 5 adults and 1 child. The front desk started laughing and said my son, who is 10, was too tall to be classed as a child. Which place classes children based on height?  Then they say,  a taller child eats more, so should pay more. It's not the amount of money, it's the principle. Who says tall people eat more than short people? I've been to buffets where the shortest and thinnest people eat much more than taller or bigger people. 

The foods were ok and our server was very attentive and polite. But I won't be coming back here ever again. And if you have tall kids, don't come here either. Tall shaming kids is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service is good depending on which days you go and how busy it is. The first time we went, our waitress explained how to cook the food, the best methods and even helped cook a few plates for us. Pricey but the quality and taste of the food is worth it as long as you can eat a lot. Second time we went was around dinner time and we felt very rushed that time, our server reminded us every 10-15 minutes or so that our seating time was running out. like shit fam i have a watch relax. besides that 4/5 would recommend."}
{"text":"I am into Japanese BBQ these days, so I decided to try this place out. I find the heat a bit hard to control, either it was too strong and you end up burning the edges or not strong enough. Overall, I find the marinade for the shrimp and squid tasted better and good compared to the beef. The miso soup tasted good. It didn't taste watery. On a weekday, we waited 20-30 minutes as they don't take reservations for a party of less than 6 people. The dessert were creme brûlée and popsicle. I felt a bit rushed as they suggested I can take my popsicle to go and eat it.."}
{"text":"Quality of the meat is below average. The meat slices  are thin, especially the beef tongue. 
It is not worth to pay almost 40 per person for an All you can eat BBQ.
It is not authentic Japanese BBQ even though the name of the store gave me an illusion. The rice taste terrible and it is not sushi rice, and Japanese BBQ doesn't come with lettuce to wrap the meat( only Korean BBQ does).
Will never come back again, gyukaku in downtown is way better than this one, and even cheaper. 
I drove 40min from downtown all the way up to try this place. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Unless you're inclined to cook your own meal, not concerned about your clothes smelling like the restaurant, and not picky about the limited menu items, then this is your gem. 

I on the other hand have a more sophisticated need for variety, the need for service and not the desire to wash every clothing item after any meal, I only go to such establment as a guest not wanting to offend the host as it is their special day. 

If you haven't clued in, I would not visit on my own volition."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian bbq place I been to. I love how they serve bimbim bap as a side dish. My sister and I went for lunch and it was worth the money. The service is A+. Seeing that it was our first time the server was giving us tips on how to cook the different meats. It's definitely smaller than places like chako and Korean grill house, however the food and service better than I have experienced. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"First time trying a Japanese bbq which there aren't much around the area. It was a great experience with the food. I love the beef it was yummy! It was kind of hot in there, the service was great when we complaint."}
{"text":"Host is very rude. They don't care for your business, tells you to wait 2 hrs upon your check in.  In other words,  they rather you to leave.

Warns you about your 2 hour seating limit the minute you are seated.  

Floor is very dirty !
Washroom is dirty !
Seats are oily and sticky!
Cups for water is oily !

Can't imagine what the kitchen will look like. Can your food be clean ??


Don't bother, there are better BBQ restaurant elsewhere. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Starting this review with a shoutout to our server joseph! A++ service dude. I know 18% gratuity was included already for my group of 16 but well deserved.

So yea, came here for my bday recently. Had a really tasty meal. All the meat was succulent af. Brisket, pork belly, boneless kalbi were the faves imo although they were all good. Joseph helped us cook a bit cuz we noobed out and put the pork in the middle which caused our flame to get too big haha. So rule of thumb according to him is u generally only wanna cook beef in the middle of the grill. Anything else supposedly burns really quick unless its on the sides. Downed a couple of sake, vodka, rum shots and merrily cooked away. 

Pretty amazing flavor on its own but they do provide a togarashi spice rub and a sweet mirin soy in case u wanna dip ur meat into either one. 

For dessert each person gets one melona and unlimited creme brulees. They had coconut melona which i had never tried. It was aiight. Not as good as the melon flavor. The top of the creme brulee was torched perfectly. Taste was aiight. Didnt blow my mind.

Pricing obviously reflects the quality of the food ur getting. ~ $32-35.

The ONE thing. Prolly my only complaint about this place is the time limit. Ughhhhhhhhh. They strictly enforce the two hour seating. The grills arent very big so they cant fit that much food on them. Being a gigantic eater, I kept ordering food but found I couldnt cook and consume fast enough. On our second last and last calls we ordered a mountain of food which left us satisfied by the end still. If i had one recommendation to them it would be to get rid of the two hr time limit (although this prolly wont happen cuz they need dem customers). Management if u see this plz, u will get an increase of one star on ur avg rating if u get rid of that damn time limit. TRUST."}
{"text":"I came here's couple weeks ago and I think it's been my favourite ayce bbq. I really enjoyed their quality and the options available to us! 

You can get a large variety of meats and veggies that you definitely wouldn't get the chance to have at other bbq places. It gives you the opportunity to try different cuts of meat that all taste great. The side dishes that you can order are pretty different as well. You can order bibimpap and cold noodles as sides that are very uncommon to come across as options. Desserts are great- you can choose creme brûlée and melona (honey dew or mango) HOW AWESOME! 

So basicallly I would 100% recommend coming here! They give such a variety of options you wouldn't find in other bbq places! Only thing I'd maybe say is although service was good once you're seated, be prepared to wait awhile for a table (especially during peak times)"}
{"text":"Went here on a friday night with some friends. The service was mediocre and honestly, I don't think the price (including taxes + tips, the bill came to $45 per person) was justified. The beef was the only thing worth coming here for, as the rest of their dishes were really bland and mediocre. The enoki mushrooms were good though, but everything else was really forgettable. You can honestly get way better quality if you went elsewhere. Only redeeming factor was the free Melona and the free refills on the pop. Sadly, I left the place on an empty and upset stomach. They also charge a 12% tip on top of the bill - while I am fine with paying this amount, the service could have been more attentive throughout. Always had to ask couple of times to get things ordered and got rejected by some waitresses/waiters throughout the night.

Don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Gyubee is a Japanese BBQ Restaurant that is really reminiscent of the yakiniku restaurants found in Japan. Located at the busy intersection of Woodbine and Steeles, the place is a bit difficult to find; depending on the time, you might have to be patient with parking!

Food: 4.5/5
Honestly, this is as good as it gets in Markham! My girlfriend and I went during dinner service and the wait was about thirty minutes. We ordered practically everything on the menu - food items that really stood out were: Beef tongue, Pork Cheek, Chicken Knee Cartilage, Enoki Mushroom, and Bibimbap. 

The first cuts of Kalbi Boneless Short Rib that were given to us were incredible, beautifully marbled and tasted better than any of the meats found in most BBQ restaurants. The cuts ordered after weren't as nice - maybe they wanted us to have a good first impression, since we told our waiter (the owner, presumably) that it was our first time there. The bibimbap comes in a cute bowl and isn't overbearing; it also tastes above average from most bibimbaps that I've had. I recommend ordering a lot of pork cheek to go with your steamed rice/lettuce wrap - you can never go wrong with pork cheek!

The quality of the food is very high and tastes fresh - it almost comes close to the expensive yakiniku AYCE in Japan. If you do end up going, try not to fill up on the veggies/appetizers as they're ordinary and can be cooked at home - and don't get the 'honey sweet potato', it takes long to cook through, and wasn't a particularly memorable food item.

Decor:
The place is on the dim side and has an intimate feeling - great for nights out with co-workers or just dates in general! Music and conversation in the background from surrounding customers makes a comfortable and sociable environment. The place is very clean and has a modern style of decor. The ventilation is very nice (not suffocating, like Chakos), but don't expect to go home without smelling like barbeque - keep your precious items in the car or on your seat away from the grill!

Is it worth it?
Yes. Yes. Yes. The price is steep, but you really do get what you pay for. The food is fresh, high quality and tastes delightful. This is the only restaurant experience I have had so far to come close to yakiniku restaurants I've had in Japan. I'll definitely go again sometime to see if they hold their standards!

Although I can't speak for lunch service (just don't go for lunch service), I browsed the lunch menu and it is incredibly lackluster; it's very easy to find a better experience at a cheaper price. Also, yes, the waiters are VERY uptight about the seating time limit (why though?!) - my advice is to order as much as possible and take your time with the foods. Because it was just me and one other, we were able to get full and enjoy our meal without having to rush. It's honestly no big deal, the servers were very apologetic to have rushed us after our time limit was passed as the group seated to our right were tipsy and had no notion of leaving anytime soon - even though they were seated before we even came in to wait."}
{"text":"To get the ultimate oral satisfaction and to protect your mouth from searing hot meat, use protection...I mean wrap your meat...I MEAN PUT YOUR MEAT IN THE LETTUCE! Talk about choking on it...choking on my words, I mean...Sigh. 

Gyubee is as close as you get in terms of food to THAT type of satisfaction, so can you blame me for getting a little flustered? Think about it, things get a little heated, you start stripping...pieces of meat from the pile and throwing it on the grill. Anyways, at the end of the night, you're sitting there exhausted and a little sweaty. Hot. 

You even get explosions in the mouth. Flavour explosions. If I had one advice, use the lettuce wraps. WRAP EVERYTHING! Pack a bit a meat, a bit of potato, a bit of whatever into a leafy pocket and enjoy a new flavour sensation with every different wrap. There is an impressive selection of quality proteins. Seasoned kalbi, chewy chicken cartilage, pork belly, beef tongue, squid...etc. The beef is always beautifully marbled and a bright, fresh red. What I'm liking about JBBQ compared to KBBQ is that not everything is drenched in marinade, so you can really see and taste what you're eating.  

Even the veggies are better than expected. Three words: Honey Sweet Potatoes. Two more words: Oyster Mushrooms. The potatoes add an amazing sweet contrast when eaten with the meat and the mushrooms are great for texture. Oyster mushrooms are also expensive so if you can get them at AYCE, that's a pretty sweet deal.  Another tip, pour the honey and butter from the potatoes into your little tins of enoki mushroom. Honey butter enoki! 

Service is good for AYCE BBQ. Things are missed once in awhile, but there's always someone there to take your order and that's fine in my books. They also changed the grill without us asking. A server saw us struggling with grilling the pork belly because of the INTENSE FIRE from the grease and ended up helping us with professional precision. Honestly, can't complain. Automatic gratuity is justified, especially with our big group. 

Two hour seating limit, but I think that's really all the time you need. Gyubee seduces you easily and thoroughly. The food may come quickly but you are welcomed to take your sweet time. Gyubee and chill. Before you know it, your pants are unbuttoned, you're panting slightly, and you're filled up real good.

{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night for an early birthday celebration with my friend. Even though it was a Thursday night, the restaurant was packed and we ended up waiting about an hour before we were seated. 

I agree with others that the quality is better than most AYCE bbq places hence the higher prices. I initially wanted to come here because it is a Japanese bbq place but with the seasoning used, it reminded me more of Korean bbq. 

My favourite dishes from this restaurant is the boneless kalbi and the enoki mushrooms. The meat are sliced pretty thin, which allows for a quicker cooking time. 

Overall it was an okay experience but kind of pricey. Our bill came out to $90 after taxes and tip (we ordered plum juice as well)."}
{"text":"I Went to this place on a friday night, the wait was really long for this place as it has become very popular lately. although its advertised as a japanese bbq, it really is more of a korean bbq for the most parts. The meat portions on each is smaller so i would order more for each portion since when they give 1 they literally give one. I find the the quality of the meat and veggie was okay, but it was only what i would call slightly better than what chako offers. the quality of meat was better. however not so much better that it can justify the huge price difference between the two place. a friday night meal will cost you about 40 bucks a person after tax and tip, and that is way too much for what is basically a korean bbq joint. If the price was only slightly more expensive than chako it would be my destination of choice, however it is not, so i probably wouldn't recommend trying it more than once. since it doesn't really offer a huge difference. the the few things i actually found i enjoyed more was their veggie, the sweet corn was good, and enoki mushroom was good. the meat was good quality, but nothing out of this world.

Also one additional problem with this place, was that the table system is very out of loop. we had made reservations for 8:00 as they told us they do not accept earlier reservations, and when we arrived did not get a table till 9:00. which for the most parts is ridicolous that you reserve and still have to wait 1 hour, this is also considering the fact that they actually enforce their 2 hour seating limit for strictly, which means they should be able to do the math and know how to set reservations"}
{"text":"It's a nice new Japanese BBQ here in uptown. I went there with my family, came in on Saturday night, and was told to wait 20-30 mins. We waited for half an hour and they called our names. It was pretty organized. A server came to our table to explain the menus and suggest how to order and show us how to cook the perfect way. Meat was tender and juicy. Love the kalbi short ribs and beef tongue! The down part is that since the meat is very thin sliced, it gets burned very easily and it was difficult to adjust the fire. 
The good part is that the server came up to our table several times to check on our order and if we wanted to order some more. She is very attentive. She even thank and shake my dad's hand at the end of our dinner before we left. I asked the other server what's her name, her name is Joey. Joey offered excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday as a group of 8. Seating felt a little bit tight and the size of the grill was sort of small. The cost on a weekend came to almost $40 per person with tax + tip, which is pricey.. but my complaints stop there. 

I really enjoyed the food, which included kalbi beef, pork belly, cow tongue, pork cheek etc., as well as very tasty shrimp, squid and various vegetables. The meats seemed quite high quality, especially in comparison to some other kbbq/ayce places where it's obvious they value quantity over quality or try to fill you up with rice. The seasonings were also really good (particularly the cumin), but the meats tasted good on their own as well. 

One of my favourites was the sweet potato in honey (the bowl in which it's presented in can also be heated up on the grill) and the cold noodles. The bibimbap is also pretty good (with a nicely fried egg) but you probably don't want to fill yourself up with so much rice.

For dessert, they have creme brulee and melona. It would be nice if the creme brulee was a little bit more caramelized and if it wasn't so cold (one could technically put the creme brulee on the grill to warm it up because it comes in a tinfoil bowl - which I did, and it tasted good lol). The melona was good and was a great way to end the meal. 

Wear stretchy pants :)"}
{"text":"Unimpressed and CLEARLY overrated. I concede that the meat are good cuts, but they are poorly marinated. But the food isn't the main problem: it's the service. I felt like I was in an eating competition given they have an unhealthy and anal obsession with their 2-hr time limit to the second. It leaves little room the enjoy the food and instead induces nothing but a sense of anxiety and being rushed. The staff make you feel like you're taking up their time and space, not welcomed. I arrived 15 minutes after my friend because of traffic, and the first thing I heard from the server was, \"You're late.\" Excuse me? What the hell kind of first impression is that? I'm late? I wasn't aware that this was a job interview. During the whole meal, the same server wouldn't stop circling our table and watching the clock. He gave us a pre-warning 1 hour in that he would warn us in another 20 minutes about the last call! Talk about pushy. I didn't get to try a number of menu items and had to constantly check my own phone to make sure I was \"on time.\" Literally felt like I was writing an exam. Horrible feeling when you're spending your hard-earned cash to enjoy a dinner at the end of a week of work.

At the end of the meal, we hadn't even started on our desserts when we were forced to pay the bill in the middle of chewing. And it came to a measly total of $46 per person! What a f***ing joke this establishment is. NEVER am I returning here and NEVER would I recommend this place to anyone.

If you want good, flavourful, and affordable BBQ without the feeling of constant stress, go to a KBBQ joint like Korean Grill House or Chako. Gyubee resides under an obscure and bland office building beside a noisy freeway with rushed and indifferent vehicles, a setting which perfectly encapsulates the experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yummy! Best Japanese bbq on the market so far. I would recommend reserving as the minimum wait time can be over an hour on busy days. The kalbi short ribs and pork belly are the best. Super fresh and flavourful. I can eat it all day. There is also seafood included -shrimp and squid (nothing special). The restaurant only lets you dine for a total of 2 hours. I would recommend ordering the portion you can finish as they will charge you. I also love the enoki mushrooms. Very buttery and a great veggie side. At the end of your meal they offer you creme brûlée and menola ice cream (Japanese bar Popsicle). The flavours when I went were banana and melon. This Japanese bbq is more on the expensive side, $30 mon to thurs and $33 Friday to Sunday plus applicable taxes."}
{"text":"I was fairly content with Gyubee's All You Can Eat! We came here for a friend's birthday and she made reservations about a month in advance just in case they were booked out (They're always super full). 

Walking in, I saw tons of people waiting on the side for spots, I wonder/hope they made a reservation because it's going to take some time. 

They had a variety (a menu that's one page), but fantastic items, of a variety of beef, sweet potatoes, bibimbap, cold noodles, lettuce for lettuce wrap, mushrooms in an aluminum foil container filled with delicious butter and garlic, and much more! All of the meat was excellent quality and well seasoned that I kept eating non stop! They also had delicious shrimp and squid, the shrimp has all the shells peeled for you.

Dessert was creme brulee and melona. The creme brulee comes in a small tin foil, tasted pretty good, not watery, but obviously not up to par with dessert shops. When you pay for the bill, you can grab your melona popsicle to go as well!

Including tips and tax, it was $40 for each person ($39.99 to be exact), which isn't TOO bad for such great quality meats. If you're not a meat fan and you enjoy seafood, I wouldn't come here, but if you love red meat, please give it a try!"}
{"text":"It is a nice place and all the food are fresh
All staffs are nice and friendly The short rib is very"}
{"text":"For the price, i was expecting higher quality meats but it all tasted on par with other (cheaper) bbq places. For larger parties they only allow reservations for inconvenient times, therefore our wait was over a hour and a half on a weekday.

I expected this place to be way better and more authentic."}
{"text":"When I had the meat it was well marinated. However, the pieces of the meat get smaller and smaller as you order more. It's not indicated on the menu but you will have to order your food piece by piece. Example: if you want marinated short ribs for 4 people you order 4 pieces. 

Their service is pretty good. In my opinion, having dinner here is not worth your money unless you want beef tongue or other extra sides. The lunch menu is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"First time I had Japanese bbq. A lot better than Korean barbecues because of how fast the meat cooks. Had a very nice waitress. Waiting time was 30 mins. Price was $43. Came on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"After calling several times and was unsuccessful, we inevitably went to the restaurant to make a dinner reservation for 12. Waited 20mins to be seated and yet we were given TWO separate non-facing tables. Okay, it was understandable to have two separate tables since they were non-movable because of the grill top design... but at least arrange two separate tables along the side allowing us facing each other.

 A friend had advised us to order a pre-set option that had mixture of everything, otherwise each order will have large portions. To our surprise, the meats were savoury and better quality than expected, especially the beef. Unfortunately, the grilling experience was inconvenient because the tongs weren't long enough to avoid the heat and high flames. After 35-40 mins of grilling, the room had become very stuffy due to the lack of ventilation from the small vent above. The \"Japanese style\", they claim to be is nothing close to the authentic Japanese BBQ in Japan. Rather, I felt its like a mix of Korean style.. I mean they had kimchi & bean sprouts (side dishes) and cold noodles & bibimbap (as rice & noodles option).

 TIP:

- Ask the server to separate the meats, otherwise they will mix the pork, beef and chicken together

- Reuse the tinfoil bowl from the sweet potato and enoki mushroom to cook other veggies to order them being burnt (ie. King oyster mushroom, corn & zucchini).

- Not recommended for large groups

 

Service: 4/10. Quality: 7/10. Overall: 5/10"}
{"text":"Very poor service, bad experience, first time in our life to be asked to pay for the leftover for $3.00/100gram. We only have left a very small portion of food which none of the all you can eat restaurant will ever ask their customers to pay. But the boss came and asked us to pay for the leftover. We were about to leave because they said we must be finish the meal in 2 hours, so we tried to corporate, never thought that they will ask for the leftover $. We were so excited to try this restaurant before, but now we are so shocked and disappointed. We all will never come again."}
{"text":"This place should not call itself a japanese restaurant.    The meat is so thin and not suitable for grilling.   The thin meat is more suitable for hot-pot but the quality is poor.    

Very expensive for what you get.   They add a tip automatically onto your bill which is not right.   Over $200 for 4 people.   Yikes !!!!!

I won't go back.   No more to say."}
{"text":"Tasty food and friendly staff, what more can you ask for? The staff is helpful even when it comes to grilling certain food items. Yes it is a bit on the pricey side but the food is definitely worth it. Also they keep a 2 hour limit for the dinner which is not bad as it makes sure that the wait time to get a table is not absurd."}
{"text":"Went there with coworkers after work.The beef is really fresh and the squid and shrimp are really tender. Overall the food has nothing to critic.
But the service makes me feel its not that good. I won't say it's the worse experience but it's just not good if compare to the other BBQ place. 
My coworker just want to have a hot water and the staff said we only have hot tea, we do have hot water but due to the policy we can not serve you hot water. We were like shocked, this is my first time know the restaurant have hot tea but no hot water for the client. That just does not make sense to me at all! That's why I am only willing to give three stars."}
{"text":"Food: The dinner menu was nothing special. The slices were pretty thin which makes it easy to burn  when you don't pay constant attention. 

Service: Even though we knew there was a time limit, the servers kept telling us that we had to leave soon throughout our meal which was very annoying. We had to keep reminding them our end time since they would keep telling us the wrong time. This made us feel very rushed.

Value: For the price you pay at this place. You get too cook your own meal and receive poor service.

Return?: Definitely not worth it. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We waited about 20mins but it wasn't too bad since it was weekend dinner time. 
There was 90 mins time limit to eat but it didn't matter for us because we finished everything within one hour.

Staff changed our grill 3 times and gave us some recommendation since it was our first time.
I loved beef the most but their sauce was too sweet for me. 
Deserts were delicious, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went for weekend lunch.  Since no reservation for tables less than 6, there were already people waiting outside at 11:55am when we arrived.
First time here.  Lots of people chose \"dinner\" option at lunch.  Lunch option was already pretty good and includes beef brisket, short rib, chicken, sausage and shrimp so we did not choose to upgrade to dinner for an extra $10.
Very happy with the meal.  Short rib and brisket were very good quality.  Shrimps were very good as well - very fresh and tasty.
Like that you can get lettuce wrap and bimibap at lunch.  We also got lots of kimchi, edamame, cold tofu and bean sprouts.
So we did not miss not having kalbi, pork cheek and squid and the other veggies that were on the dinner menu.

Service was great.  Food came out fast.  Servers checked on us frequently.  Changed our grill without asking.
Only thing is Cash only and they are very strict on the time limit.  We found 90 min plenty of time for lunch. 
Will stick to this place now for BBQ - well worth the extra cost compared to Chinese K-bbq places or the ones on Yonge/Finch."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight after reading the reviews from other yelpers. I must say its pretty damn good for an ayce place. Be sure to call ahead and make a reservation. Even though price is a bit higher than other ayce bbq places around Markham but it was worth it. Not a big selection of meats but the quality of it was pretty good, especially the marinated kalbi short ribs. Their order system was very efficient, at first the server got us a little bit of everything just to try. After that she took our order by pieces. I must say I was surprised by it but at the end no food was wasted, which was a good thing. I will definitely go back."}

It was 1030 pm, and we had at least 5 people let us know that their last call is at 1115 and they close at 12. Probably wont be back especially when it cost $40 a person.."}
{"text":"Good food but a little expensive and I like how they give popsicle as a dessert. The environment is not too dim but not too bright"}
{"text":"Bomb dot com. 
Mouth fucking gasm. 
Meat sweats. 
Melona bars are awesome. 

^ I put the TL;DR on top because that's all you need to know if you're debating on whether or not to try it or not. 

If you have $30-40 to spare, this is your place. You will not have to eat for the rest of the day if you grab this for lunch.
The service is great, they're fast and don't get anything wrong. The menu is vast and has lots of options (beef brisket, miso beef - fucking best thing there, beef tongue, beef slices with the perfect marbling, chicken thigh, chicken knee, shrimp, squid, pork belly etc)
The beef was all so delicious. The pepper beef Kalbi will make you commit sins because it's so good and fat AND IF THIS IS WHY I NEED 15 MORE MINUTES ON THE STAIRMASTER, then let it be. 

I know, I know- the ex vegan me is crying and shaking her head so far but honestly I'm going to say.... IT IS WORTH IT. the meat is not over salted or anything that makes you kind of sick after awhile. I felt completely okay even though I felt like I ate more than I usually do when I went to chako or Korean grill house. 

Oh and melona. Yum. Great dessert - wish we could have more than one but honestly can understand why they don't. Bottomless creme brûlée though- which was actually VERY good and would definitely get again. 

I don't ever go to AYCE and if you read my reviews, you know I seldom give five stars unless they deserve it and who would've thought I'd give a AYCE meat place 5/5. 
F'REAL... go try this now or like, what are you doing?"}
{"text":"Came here on labour day for lunch!

First off they are marketed as a Japanese grill house not Korean. However they are owned by Chinese individuals. 

Overall it's extremely pricey, however the meat quality is a much higher grade than your average all you can eat bbq. They may have similar name and try and copy the original Japanese bbq gyu kaku but it's not as good. 

One the high note: 
The house marinated short ribs were really soft and melt in your mouth. However they were overly salty for my liking.

The pork belly was delicious!!! No complaints at all!

The reason why I'm giving this place a two is because I have a peanut allergy and they had watermelon ice cream for dessert. Usually I'm very careful in asking and making sure there aren't any peanuts in my food. As I was reading the wrapper I read 'chocolate covered peanuts' when I asked the server if there were peanuts she confirmed yes but she didn't really try and make the situation better she just bushed it off. Than when I paid the bill tip was already included 15%, which I didn't really think they deserve 15% if I could've had a allergic reaction."}
{"text":"Feels like this is a Korean bbq place but they said they are Japanese. There's a long wait and you can only reserve the table if you have a group of more than 6 or else don't even think about getting in without 2 hours wait. Service was good and food are good. I have to admit. This place have one of the best beef that has been serve out of all bbq places I've been to. The downside is they only allow you to have one dessert."}
{"text":"Gyubee just might be my go to AYCE BBQ place now. Fantastic quality of the food here makes gyubee a winner in my books. While the menu may not be that large, it's a quality menu with great items on it.

Even on a weekday evening this place was packed. Since we didn't come with a party of 6, we couldn't get a reservation and ended up waiting for a hour.

So you're probably going what's Japanese BBQ? Well, what's interesting is that Gyubee markets itself as a Japanese barbeque place but the restaurant also has an equal or even greater Korean barbeque influence as well. They could have called this KBBQ and no one would have noticed. Side dishes such as kimchi and bean sprouts were served along with ssamjang, garlic, and bibimbap. The place is begging for you to make ssam wraps! Nothing wrong with that at all because the variety and choice is always a good thing. 

More marquee items include some great buttered enoki mushrooms, corn, and king oyster mushrooms, along with cold noodles and bibimbap which were much better than I expected. Boneless beef short ribs, beef tongue and chicken knuckles were amongst our favourites. And to end your fiery meal, you have the option of getting Korean popsicles. 

Do ask the waiters to change the grill maybe halfway into your meal to ensure a char-less and better BBQ experience. 

I guess the downside to Gyubee is its' fairly steep price. Weekday dinner totaled to $42 out the door, which is definitely priced at a premium.

So all in all Gyubee boasts a well-balanced menu all around from veggies to meats to seafood and there's definitely something for everyone here at gyubee."}
{"text":"If you like unlimited amounts of above average quality meat, this place is for you! For roughly $34 incl taxes and tips on a weekend, you get unlimited amounts of marinated beef (different cuts), chicken (two types), pork (different cuts) and seafood (squid and shrimp). There is also a good selection of vegetables to grill and a small selection of side dishes (bibimbap, korean cold noodles, kimchi, miso soup, rice, etc). 

This place is by all means not Japanese bbq (I would even argue that it tastes more like korean bbq) but it is very tasty. Service is great, waiters are extremely fast and check up on you quite often. There is a very strict 2hr seating limit but we found that it was enough for our group. 

Their creme brule dessert is amazing (I have 3 to myself!!) and they also have melona (korean popsicles) that you can eat there or take to go. 

Overall, great place to go if you are hungry and are a meat eater. I wish that they would extend their 2 hr siting limit for larger groups (we were 5 people grilling on a single grill and felt limited by the time allocated)."}
{"text":"I only come here for lunch because I feel like the price is more worth it then, there's not a huge difference to me personally between the dinner and lunch menu. I always get seated right away but I go on Sunday morning between noon to 2pm and theres never a line up. 

Way better than any other asian bbq place. Its not really Japanese because theres a mix of korean items in there. The kalbi is tender and not chewy, good beef flavour, and stays juicy and in small enough pieces that it cooks fast. The pork belly is thin, fatty and gets nice and cripsy on the edges after the grill. The quality of meat is much better than the usual korean grill house. and the best part THE SHRIMP IS PEELED!!! and you can order as much shrimp as you want!!!  No one stops you from ordering 50+ shrimp. 

You can also get the lettuce wraps on the side wtih garlic and a spicy sauce. Their bimbimbap was ok, nothing to rave about but its a great addition and side to the meal and better than the usual white rice. The veggie sides however were not fresh, their beansprouts were limp and on the verge of being brown. 

They are pretty serious about their time limit and will definitely let you know when its your last call, so it's a bit rushed for 4 people sharing a grill but if you go with 2 people its plenty of time to leave ridiculously full. Their service though is prompt and they will change the grill for you. However, there are a few servers that are literally walking zombies or having a really bad hangover all the time and unwilling to move. But yeah the melona at the end is perfect (only 1 melona and no other dessert choice for lunch) Its not for everyday but once in a while its a good splurge if you want (delicious) meat sweats"}
{"text":"I've been there for couple of time, food were 3.5 stars, it wasn't that bad. BUT this time the server really pissed me off! Me and my friend randomly just went there around 5:45 last week on Thursday, the reception lady told us it was about 30-40mins of waiting time. So we waited for 40mins and we asked again, she was like \"oh you have to probably wait for another 40mins\", and her face was like she doesn't give a s*** at all, you can just leave if you don't want to wait. I mean, lady, this is not the proper attitude to treat your customers! We wasted 40 mins waiting and l left, you could at least tell us in the first place if you think the wait time is more than an hour. And AT LEAST be nice to us! Not coming back to ever"}
{"text":"their customer service is the worst. I Was trying to make a reservation for eight people, the girl in the phone talk so rude and told me if I don't have eight people show up by the time we get there, they still charge eight people in my bill. Never been to a restaurant like this,  so ridiculous.."}
{"text":"I joined several friends for a boys night ot and all you can eat Saturday night Japanese BBQ at Gyubee.  Gyubee impressed me with their excellent, high quality BBQ.  The meats were very clean and were very good cuts.  They also provide you with options of marinated or not marinated for some of their popular BBQ selections like the beef short ribs.  The price per person is slightly over $30 for a dinner, but I think Guybee is competitively priced given their higher quality BBQ meats.

We ordered a variety of meats: marinated beef, unmarinated beef short rib, marinated beef short rib, pork, pork sausage, chicken, shrimp and squid.  Additionally, we ordered some of their vegetables including zuchini, enoki mushroom, king oyster mushrooms, etc.  Complimentary side dishes such as kimchi and rice can also be requested.

Service at the restaurant was ok.  They responded when we needed them and brought us the correct orders.  Time between ordering and receiving the food varied.  It was fastests right at the beginning of the meal and gradually slowed down during the course of the dinner (to their credit, we got everything we ordered and nothing was missed, though I would have liked them to bring food a little faster later in our meal, it could have been due to more customers and more work for the servers).

A couple of things of note:  
1. Guybee has a 2 hour time limit.  After 2 hours, you can no longer make any orders except for desserts, it made us feel a bit rushed and they strictly enforce the time limit. 
2. Similar to many of its BBQ competitors, Guybee will change your grill for you once during your meal, at your request.

I was debating with myself whether Gyubee was a 3 star or a 4 star when we finished the meal and were splitting the bill.  Somehow, our group we miscalculated for the bill (which includes service charges - they did not bother pointing it out to us) and we were $0.10 short of the bill total.  This led the server to give us an extremely rude lecture about paying correctly (put it into context - I acknowledge we made a mistake, we were short $0.10 on a bill over $150) and decreased my overall satisfaction of Gyubee.

Nevertheless: Quality BBQ, passable service. 3.1 / 5.0"}
{"text":"The wait is always long. Reservations are for only 6ppl+ Service is great, nice char and grill on meat. My favorite is the Melona or creme brûlée. I wish there we'd more veggie selection."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch when they first open at 12 p.m. The service was ridiculously poor here. I cannot stress how bad the service was. Firstly, there was an obvious DRINK advertisement on the wall and I asked one of the servers \"what is that?\" And her reply was \"a drink\". I then said I know it is a drink but what kind of drink is it?. When our food orders came, not a single server turned on the stove for us nor did they give us instructions to do so either. Even at hotpot places with the easiest stoves, servers will turn on the stove for us when they put the pot down. We ordered the bibimbap and one bowl of rice and the rice was obviously old. It was hard and dry. We asked for it to be replaced and they did - they replaced with the same batch of old rice from the night before. The first bibimbap had rice and an egg sunny side up with some sauce. This was the saddest bibambap of life. However, when it was replaced after the complaint about the old rice, there were more ingredients in it like seaweed and veggies so they obviously slacked off when making the first order for us. When they came to change our grill in the middle of our lunch, they didnt bother putting the food back properly. Our food looked like a pile of garbage with the meats and veggies stacked on top of each other in the corner. Our waters was not refilled A SINGLE TIME - that IS the easiest thing to do as a server.

I came here for lunch with one other person and they automatically charge a 12% gratuity - could this be the reason they absolutely do not care about providing any service since there is an auto tip added no matter how small the party is?

However, the meat was fresh here and food was good, aside from the old rice. They serve melona ice cream for dessert. Needless to say, the food isn't worth it for the type of service I get here. I personally do not like my food being rearranged to look like a stack of garbage and i do not think it is fair that they think they deserve 12% gratituty for this non existent service."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Portions were a perfect size and were perfectly seasoned. Ordered the beef brisket, pork belly, kalbi, shrimp, zucchini, and mushroom. Even the mushrooms had some sort of seasoning.  The bibimbab was good, had better at other places, but it was decent. Staff were really helpful, gave advice on how to cook and were really attentive. Would definitely come back to try the dinner menu"}
{"text":"Service was wonderful.  Food was even better!  Heard many great things about Gyubee so I decided to come with a group of friends on Sunday night. 8 people together and we paid around 55$ per person because we ordered three jars of beer and sake.  But if you don't order drinks, it will run you around $35 per person on weekend nights, which I think is pretty reasonable for a good Japanese BBQ (Much better than Chako).

Just like Chako, this place does all you can eat format, the menu has a variety of beef, chicken, pork, seafood and vegetables.  With 8 people, of course we ordered EVERYTHING.  Everything came pretty quickly and portions were great including each subsequent orders! All the dudes at the table including myself actually fell full and thought at one point the portion was too generous, but we are not going to complain about that!  

If you want to narrow down to a few items to try, I highly recommend the House Marinated Kalbi Short Rib, Beef Brisket, Pork Belly, Sausages, Squid, Enoki Mushroom, White Mushroom and Butter Corn.  Run those non-stop and you will enjoy your meal a lot and trust me, they all taste delicious!  Top it off with Creme Brulee and Melona, you are set for a full meal.

I highly recommend this place if you want decent BBQ with a group of friends!!"}
{"text":"Heard this place was supposed to be good because they serve \"higher quality meats\" but I thought it was pretty meh, they are also pretty strict on the 1.5 hour seating limit, before our meal began the server told us specifically and started a timer. the service was pretty good and the food wasn't bad but I rather go to Chako or Korean grill house. The price was not worth the meal I felt."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place so many times and has never been so disrespected before. Not only from the servers and hostess, but also for the owner. All i wanted was a bigger table for 5 people. But they gave us a small table with only one grill and making my mom sit on the side. Which is a safety hazard since everyone is walking past there. When I asked for a bigger table they said that table reserved, fine. When i asked them to extend this table they said sorry we dont do that. I find it ridiculous how 5 people have to share one grill, by the time we finished first round of our food, it was nearly last call. The manager came after and asked if we were full. And we said yes, and he said okay then 5 people is good enough for one grill. He does not understand that its not being full, its about the service that they provide. At the time i went it wasnt even busy and the front even said there were still a lot of table. But they bullshitted saying it was busy when we came so they couldnt extend our table. The manager kept arguing with us and said that their \"rule\" is that 5 people only gets ONE grill. I told him, ive had 5 people before and had 2 grills and he said \"that is impossible\". Clearly they dont care about their customers and dont care if they lose customers."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, ayce jap yakiniku,so don't expect the \"best\" meat. They advertised this place as japanese,but the food tasted like korean to me. An authentic Japanese bbq place should not have kimchi nor \"kalbi\" on the menu,that just defeats the purpose of the Japanese bbq culture. Food taste was just o-k,I would order all beef next time & not their special starter platter with everything in it..only the beef was good. I would suggest Gyubee to provide some cubes of butter to grease the grill so the food would taste better & have more japanese styled side dishes."}

There is a two hour time limit the moment you sit down. So we made the most of it. Overall the food was really good and great portion size. I've to say that this place is now my new favourite all you can eat/BBQ Japanese Korean place to go. I will visit again"}
{"text":"The food was great. Came here from the US and when it was time to pay our bill we tried using our credit card. Unfortunately we didn't realized that they didn't accept credit cards. The lady didn't tell us that until after 45 minutes of us trying different credit cards. I would have gave it 5 stars if she informed us ahead of time that they only accepted Canadian debit."}
{"text":"Gyubee is, by far, the best AYCE restaurant I've ever been to. The meats are nice cuts and sooo flavourful.

Have you ever been to a Korean BBQ AYCE in the GTA and they give you nice cuts of meat on the first round, only to give you nothing but shitty pieces afterwards? *cough Korean Grill House cough*. Well, you won't get that here, folks!

I enjoyed everything here, except for the wait times. I came on a Saturday night around 8pm and it was a 2 hour wait for 2 seats. That said, the food was worth the wait and I can't wait to return. 

The ventilation here is great, service was very friendly and knowledgeable, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Their food was super fresh. The special beef is clearly marbled and the shrimp is bouncy.

However, the menu does not have many items, especially veggies or cold dishes. Both the table and the grill are too small, which should be serving 2 people instead of 4.

Also, the AC was not cooling. It was a hot day inside a room with more than 20 burning grills. Horrible experience.

This place does not take credit card and their bill already includes 12% service fee AFTER TAX, be sure to not double tip."}
{"text":"Good service, and we got 10% off after 9pm. Food is regular best . Just too thin with the slice meat, but with buffet is ok, and Butter Sweet potato is recommended."}

I love how their ribs are boneless and the shrimps are peeled!! They have a pretty good selection of meat and veggies. Some of the must orders are: house marinated kalbi, sausages, honey sweet potato, enoki mushroom,cold noodle, and melona popsicle! The sauce that they provide is also a plus. 

The service here for an ayce place was pretty good. The servers were attentive and super patient. 

Price wise, this was definitely on the higher end. The lunch menu was enough for me however there are some items I really enjoyed in the dinner menu that are not offered during lunch :( you can also opt for the dinner menu during lunch and get 15% off your bill. 

The one thing I dislike about this place is the strict time limit, as others have mentioned. You get 1.5 hours for lunch and 2 hours for dinner."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new restaurant for my birthday. So decided to come here with my friends. The restaurant ambiance was posh and modern.  I like the lighting and bench type seating booth tables. The menu list wasn't extensive. So we basically ordered everything. 

My fave was actually the Black Pepper Beef. It was thick cuts of possible ribeye beef. I love grilling zuchinni so I ordered a bunch of that too ;D They had side dishes and also little foil containers for yams, corn niblets, & enoki mushrooms. Bascially you place them in the grill with the foil and it poach itself in the butter or syrup for yams. 

But I find that the BBQ is more Korean than Japanese? The side dishes were all Korean, kimchi, bibimbap, garlic, rice, lettuce, etc.

Dessert was also Korean. Lol. Melona Brand Popsicles. They also had Crème Brûlée.

Overall it was ok. Serivce was great, waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"We came without a reservation for 4 at 630pm and had to wait in their large waiting room that was dark and depressing. Next time we'll bring cards. 

I went with a 2 time veteran of this restaurant who boasted about their quality of food and service. He wasn't wrong.

The 1.25 hrs of wait was worth it. The service was curtious and attentive. The short ribs were well marbled. The garlic butter enoki mushrooms were amazing! We used the left over butter to cook our seafood too. 

Call ahead for tables of 6+ to avoid the refugee waiting room. Otherwise bring something to endure the 1hr+ wait!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here the other night! The atmosphere was perfect for a fun night - great music, beautiful decor, and that delicious aroma! In terms of overall quality, they exceed what you would expect from an AYCE KBBQ. The staff were all very helpful, happy, and enthusiastic which made the overall visit a lot better. 
The manager came by and taught us how to make the most of our dining experience - teaching us the best way to cook the food, where to position everything, etc. 

The food quality was excellent. The meat was fresh and a perfect balance of fat and meat. The seasoning was well done and there was a good variety of foods to choose from. I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I want to share a bad experience in Gyubee.
I just travel here from U.S, this restaurant only accepts local debit card, I paid by U.S dollar, they said exchange rate is 1:1. That is ok. But they tell me 82$ when I check out. I call for a receipt after I paid them 82 u.s dollar. But I noticed that only 73$ on receipt by hand writing, there are 10% off on it, I guess it is a discount for cash. So, where is 9$? It just went away, I don't know who got it, maybe the restaurant, maybe the waiter.
Another thing is they will collect all flavor can before they close amount 1 hour. And the taste is just so-so, for this price I expect better meat.
Above all, I think this restaurant may have deceived customer (maybe foreigner only?) Or they may just avoid tax."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday night and there was a little bit of a wait but they have a comfortable waiting lounge. Loved the food here! One of the staff (manager or owner, not sure) also went out of his way to teach us how to grill each type of meat to reach the best taste and texture. He was with us for at least 15-29 minute teaching us grilling techniques. The quality of the meat was also very good and they used fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Good food but service is shit. Stop being racist to people who just want to come, enjoy and eat."}
{"text":"At first they said it will be 1 hour wait for today on a Friday.  Needed only 15 mins to get a table.  Not bad.  Beef, chicken, pork all available.  Veggies also good for bbq.  Menu says it all.  Server was attentive.  The bbq is hot so be careful putting food on it."}
{"text":"First of all, menus are one of the most filthy items you can find in a restaurant but I was so pleasantly surprised to see separate bins for servers to place used menus and take clean menus!  

Second of all,  the place did not smell like bbq or smoke,  unlike many other korean bbq locations. 

In terms of food,  the beef was decent, the pork was similar to what you can buy from galleria.  Quality was not as good as the yakiniku niku places in Japan, but for the price and quantity of the meats given, I'd say it's a good deal, especially for lunch combos.

Took another star off due to the service. Everyone's nice, but there is room for improvement. And maybe I have a higher expectations because of having been to Japan plenty of times, and eaten at many restaurants, the Japanese servers take pride in their service.

1) The servers actually brought us the wrong meats. We ordered beef brisket, pork shoulder, marinated beef and kalbi. I didn't realize they brought us pork cheek jowl until I remembered one of the meats looking like pork jowl that we had once at a Korean bbq place.  We asked the server to confirm the type of meat we were eating and they in fact gave us the wrong meat... but we already had some so we just left it the way it was. 
2) The grill gets pretty dirty from burnt bits and overtime, that affects the taste of the meat and grilling experience. We asked the server to change the grill, she said that they don't offer to change the grill if you are only having the lunch combo and not AYCE but it was nice of her to change it anyway. Again, the grill should have and would have been changed in a Japanese yakiniku restaurant, no questions asked. 
3) servers kept on speaking different chinese languages to us. We spoke English to them, and different servers just automatically asked us questions in Cantonese one time, then mandarin another time. I think it is helpful for those who speak the language but just because we look chinese don't assume we can speak either. 

We will come back because this place definitely trumps other ones around town."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Average food. Totally not worth with this price. The fire of the grill is easy to get on fire. Forced to add a 12% tips for poor service. Asked extra charge for a few pieces of meat that you can't finish.

Worst restaurant experience ever!"}
{"text":"My fav BBQ restaurant! I never liked eating ayce oily meats at kbbq but Gyubee has definitely changed that for me. Came in a group of 4 and ordered pretty much the whole menu. Loved the beef selection, the cold noodle and the variety of veggie options. The bibimbap is a must order! 

They don't take resos for groups under 6 so we ended up waiting almost an hour on a weeknight. Worth it though! 

Cash/Debit only."}
{"text":"Today is their 4th day opening.  Service is good.  Food quality is good.  Even though it's all you can eat but the quality is better than your average ayce.  Pictures speak louder than words - i will post some soon!  Really busy place.  The restaurant isn't that big (kinda small)  and their seating floor isnt all opened up yet so there will be a wait with no reservation.  I arrived around 6pm on a Tuesday night and had to wait around 25 minutes.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  They speak English and Chinese.  Portions are small so you can take your time and try everything before ordering your favs.  There is a BBQ section and ready to eat section.  My fav for meat bbq section is chicken knee cartilage (not many places have it).  My fav for ready to eat is salmon carpaccio!  Yep they have salmon sashimi ayce too! Love it!  Will be back soon again!  If u r on a diet... well... after coming here u will forget about that diet cuz its pretty awesome."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a neat concept but the food is a little bland. Overall worth a try but I am not I will email back"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for my brother's birthday, on a Friday night with a reservation for six. Was seated immediately. They have a strict 2-hour limit.

This is a Japanese All-You-Can-Eat BBQ place, so you order your meats and veggies and cook them yourself on the table grills. They also have other items like noodles and rice.

I think the quality of the meat here is better than what you'd find at KBBQ places, and they offer a good range of items. The short ribs were good. I also especially enjoyed the condiments they provided. There's a light sweet soy and a powdered seasoning that I thought went great with everything.

At the end, you get your choice of a melona ice cream bar.

Price is on the higher side."}
{"text":"Gyubee is an all-you-can-eat Japanese BBQ restaurant that serves up some really good tasting food. You do, however, have to cook it yourself!

Their dinner menu offers several cuts of beef, pork and chicken, along with shrimp, squid, and several vegetable options. There are also appetizers, miso soup, rice, noodles, and dessert included.

Our server punched our orders into a tablet and they started arriving at our table before we were even finished ordering. Wow, that's fast!

Each dish was presented at the table with a brief tutorial/recommendation on how to cook it. They even put the first batch of meat on the grill for us! The meats are cut so thin, they cook in under a minute. The cooking got so fast and furious, it was sometimes hard to keep up with the eating.

Everything tasted good but our favourites were the boneless short ribs, beef brisket, pork belly, pork shoulder, asparagus, and mushrooms. Believe me, we tried everything on the menu! Each portion is small so we ordered frequently and the service was very efficient. So was the clearing.

Despite all the grilling, and some burning (Ooops!), the ventilation was very good, with each burner surrounded by a vent sucking out all the smoke and odours.

Overall, good quality and good tasting food, very efficient service. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is my first experience of a live Korean BBQ.

The parking to the restaurant I find is relatively limited.

We made a RSVP but yet had to wait for our tables. We came as a party of 25.

They tried to squeeze all of us into two booths, with all of us ranging in all different sizes. They wouldn't give us a third booth to accommodate us.

The service is fairly slow and refused for us to order more than x amount of food all at once. Which we had to input multiple times. For example, there are 14-16 of us at one table, we tried to order 14-16 creme brulee, but they would only allow us 8. They also ran out certain amount of food, which you think they would be ready for our party due to the heads up, weeks notice we gave.

The food was delicious with lots of options. We got creative and made our own recipes as we were grilling.

If you don't mind smelling like BBQ food after, I'd suggest this would probably be the last place you attend and then call it a night."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and each time the service was great. A bit disappointing when it comes to their wait time (usually one hour) but they have a large waiting area; if only they renovated that area to be able to serve as part of the restaurant then it would free up so much tables. Aside from that, food is always fresh and the portion given is just right so it doesn't go to waste."}
{"text":"This place is my fave bbq place ever!!! What's not to like?!?
Customer service is amazing. They don't hesitate to help their customers and inform them about which meat is best placed on the grill and how long.

The salmon carpaccio is great! I recommend trying that and having the enoki mushrooms and sweet potatoes. I also recommend trying all the meats! And pick your fave on the second order. 1 order is 1 serving! I would recommend order 10 of all the beef! It's my fave :)

The ambiance is modern but comfy. Great for intimate dinners or family celebrations."}
{"text":"Last week I decided to give this place another try - my friend and i came at 7:45pm and had to wait almost an hour until the next round started, so by the time we got our seats it was almost 9pm - last call is at 10:20pm.

This time, they had more items on the menu! I was so glad they finally had the miso beef brisket!! I was set after knowing this was on the menu. I love the miso sauce so much that I even asked the guy to give me some on the side as an extra and i ended up dipping my short rib pieces into it too... oh my goodness was it freaking delicious!!

Service was better than last time - they came by to change our grill plates once in a while and refilled our water, and whenever we ordered more food they were pretty quick at filling the orders and didn't mess up on anything that we ordered. Becuase it was last call we ended up gettin a few more plates of beef and also like 10 creme brulees to eat (there were 3 of us) and they were very nice about giving it all to us at the same time! 

Defininitely the food is better this time - the only exception i wasn't crazy on the sweet potatoes - they were very starchy and dry tasting for some reason. But the sausages were great, along with the mushrooms and the corn :)

Bibambap was okay -the egg was kinda cold so it didn't run when i cut it open but otherwise it was well seasoned.

I love eating the meat with the lettuce - almost like a lettuce wrap! aside from the long waittime, this place is decent to eat - but perhaps next time we gotta time it better.. either we eat at 6pm... or we eat at 9 LOL."}
{"text":"I quite like the quality of the meat at this place. Staff was also friendly in general."}
{"text":"The meat is good quality, if just based on the food, i would give 3.8 stars..
BUT...
3 stars for the price, $29.99 per person, for this price there wasn't enough variety to choose from.
Also the typical rude customer service at a Chinese owned restaurant, we waited over 25 mins to get the dessert after telling 3 different servers. 
We ordered food refill 4 times and not once did they get it correct.
At 8:30pm, they cleaned the washroom with a very strong product... we sat about 6 tables away, and we can smell it. Ruined our appetite.
The worse was they charged my 12 year old  daughter as an adult $29.99 instead as a child, when on the menu it says 'child ages 5-12'. We pointed it out to the server and it took a while to convince her that 5-12 means 12 is inclusive."}
{"text":"The food is seasoned so well and is soooo tasty. I highly recommend! Be prepared to wait 30-40 mins it's a very popular place. I went for the lunch menu and was very satisfied with the choices. The restaurant is also pretty hidden and hard to miss, its on the first floor of a business building."}
{"text":"Over all, the marinated kalbi is good. The service is very bad~ only 2hours for all you can eat but they tried to cut down the orders and took so long the get the food, so time run faster than you can expect. They have limitation for the dessert, one person only can get one popsicle and a very small cream berele. The price is very expensive for those don't eat a lot. I will prefer the izakaya restaurant instead of this one."}
{"text":"My first time having Japanese BBQ... I think it just tastes like Korean BBQ with better meat - even the marinade seems quite similar and the side dishes are all Korean! But whatever it is, I'd definitely be back! It does cost a bit more than other BBQ places such as Chako and Korean Grill House but it is so worth it! The quality of the meat is a lot better. There is a time limit here but because the service is so quick, it isn't an issue. Also, the servers are super helpful and they even changed the grill for us a few times! In the end, I was pretty satisfied, would definitely come back again! 

All the meat items are pretty yummy, but skip the sausage - that one wasn't very good. Also, when you order meat, they give you large portions - you need to be clear if you don't want that much!"}
{"text":"What an experience. Came here on a monday night with 2 other friends. Ate soooo much delish meats. Very different from other Bbqs. I been a fan of chako for along time after discovering this place i dont think i ll ever go back. They have plenty of servers that walk around. Staff is very friendly. And one of the things that i really loved is the server will come around and offer you a grill change before you even ask. This is what i call great service. Thank god i dont have to get \"cut eyes\" everytime i want the gril changed. Up to the very last minute i was extremely pleased. My server name was (Jo)"}
{"text":"This is now my favourite table top grill restaurant. The wait was a little long around 45 minutes on a Friday night at 6pm, but definitely worth it. It's also a little pricier than other places but I think it's worth the extra cost. 

The server was very helpful and suggested we get a mixture of all the different meats to try. The difference between this and restaurants like Chako or Korean Grill House is the quality of the meat. They are thinly sliced so it cooks quite quickly. Our favourite was the house marinated kalbi and pork sausage. We also ordered the enoki mushrooms which comes in a tin with butter. That was delicious and we used the tin to cook the rest of our veggies. We also ordered the 9oz Sapporo (huge) and lychee mojito which were both great. Finally we ordered the creme brulee and melona for dessert. I actually really enjoyed the creme brulee. In terms of timing, they do come around at around 1.5 hours in to let you know it's time for last call. There is a strict 2 hour time limit."}
{"text":"It is one of my least favourite things to write an unsatisfactory review but unfortunately this time I must do that Ladies and Gentlemen. 

Dinner Menu: $30 I think not worth it. Nothing special. 

Strict two hour limit and then they kick you out together with whatever you ordered. 

Here is how it is done: 

Waiter: \"Sorry but someone is waiting for your table  can I offer you to move to the waiting room where you can eat the desert\" 

Me: \"But I ordered another Sapporo\" 

Waiter: \" Unfortunately we can not bring you anything else. You have to move.\"

They never told me In advance that I was running out of time either. 

What can I say. Now I know why their tips are included in the bill automatically."}
{"text":"expensive.  you can get the same at another ayce korean grill at half the price.  the food is just like korean grill place.  not much selection.  they won't even give you hot water when they have tea and will charge you for it. and they force to you to pay 12% tip plus it's cash only.  for about $12 more you can choose the dinner menu but honestly there isn't that much more choice comparing to the lunch menu."}
{"text":"I came to this place around 5:30pm during a snowy weekday and the restaurant was pretty full despite the weather and early dinner time.
We were seated within 10 minutes of waiting. 
Some sections of the restaurant had empty tables as they were assigning customers to certain areas based on what time they had came in.
Every table had a maximum of two hours of eating time.
There was a wide selection of meats to choose from and pretty much all the different cuts and flavours of beef were amazing! You can't go wrong in choosing any of their beef items. 
All the other selection of meats and seafood were good except for the chicken. The chicken had too much bones and I thought it just tasted bad.
The veggie selections were good as well. My favourite was the enoki mushrooms as well as the wedges. 
For the dessert, I ate the creme brûlée which I loved! I'm a sucker for creme brûlée in general and I ate four of them that night. 
This place also offers melona bars for dessert and they provided us a choice of either strawberry or coconut.
The service was mediocre despite the food being pretty good. They were not attentive for most of the night and I had to ask for a glass of water four times before being given one. They are quick in giving you the bill though lol"}
{"text":"Terrible service and inflexible staff.

I went here with a group of friends last summer, while the food was good it lacked a variety of choices especially if you don't eat beef.

As we approached the 100 minute mark, the server asked if we wanted dessert and took our order. They only gave popsicles as dessert. My friend and I are still trying to finish the rest of the meat on the table, we asked if they can just bring our popsicle later as it will melt. The server said no, there is a seating limit.

I looked outside and there is no line up. I have never seen anyone actually enforce a seating limit especially when we stopped ordering and we are finishing the food on the table. Why would I want my popsicle to melt when I have 20 minutes left? They would not serve you dessert.

Despite that, I tried to bring my family to experience this place for the weekend. I called to make a reservation for 5 people, they said they only take 6+ people. I explain that the table 5 people sit at, is the same as 6 people. I asked if the manager can make an exception. He hangs up on me.

I guess we will take our business somewhere else. Asian places like to set up rules, are not flexible. I even asked if they could take a reservation and if they are truly busy I don't mind if they give up my reservation to another 6+ people people. Won't even do that either.

This place is not worth first come first serve. As you get older, you want to go somewhere that has reservations and not waste time."}
{"text":"They have both meat and veggie and seafood. Not many places have seafood (grilled shrimp) in their AYCE menu. I love how their marbling of the meat is, I love how fast the meat comes out. We went there with a party of 4 around 6:30PM on a Thursday and we were seated immediately. When we left around 8PM there was approx. 20 people in line. Service is pretty awesome, our waitress taught us how to cook some of the types of beef and vegetables."}
{"text":"Went here for a late birthday lunch and had a great meal. This is basically a Korean BBQ-type restaurant but you use a Japanese grill to cook your food. 

The staff is friendly and attentive and they show you how certain meats should be cooked and which parts of the grill they should be placed on. The water is always refilled and they are prompt with bringing out your orders. 

Although it is a bit pricey, the quality of the meats are great for an AYCE restaurant. You can see all the marbling on the different cuts and they are melt in your mouth. The vegetable choices are great too, especially the enoki mushrooms in butter that are given to you in a foil tray that you place directly on the grill. To finish off, desserts include a choice of 3 flavours of melona or creme brûlée."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place to get japanese bbq. Even though it tastes much like Korean bbq tho. But definitely the meat is alot more tastier and better quality than what you get a kbbq's. 

The 2 best things that at this place you can order is the short ribs. Get the house special and the Kalbi. They are very tender and good marinate. Tried almost all the meats on the menu but I believe the two short ribs are the better tasting choices. 

The bibimbap was pretty good as well! AYCE Bibimbap?! That is pretty sweet deal..  The cold noodles were pretty good as well. Good noodle texture. They were chewy the cold soup goes very well with the noodles. 

The service was very fast with all the orders, and very attentative with following up with everything. At times the  grill was spitting up pretty big flames and burning the our food pretty quickly so they gave us a bowl of ice to help reduce the heat a bit. Good solution. Recommended to ask your server to give you a side bowl of ice to help control and down the flames if they are getting too big. 

The salmon carpaccio is also very good. If you've gone to Guu before and ordered that its similar to that and the good thing is its AYCE as well, BIG fan of that.  

This place is pretty good for a better alternative than your choices of kbbq's. More quality and better meat. If your looking for quality and AYCE this is a good place to come and try. I wouldn't give this place a perfect 5 stars since when I got there it seemed that their table arrangements were a bit unorganized. There was an open cabin table with no reservation, and waited a good 20-25 mins and when they called me over they directed me to that open/available table which was open from when I had came in! So what happened? Also it's a bit pricey as well. Weekdays you're spending around $30 and weekends $33. Quite expensive but I suppose they're catering more quality therefore their price they charge customers is to cover for the cost of meat stock. Overall, good place."}
{"text":"New restaurant, so I go try. oh my god, food tastes horrible, I thought there would be a lot of beef options, but there was only 4 types of beef choice. There was only 1 page of choice. We ordered 5 plate of mushroom, they gave us 1 plate, we ordered 7 plate of mushroom again, and they gave us the same portion. 
The worst thing is they force you to pay 12% tips. The table next to us refused to pay that 12% service fee and they called the cops. Service is OK but you cannot focus me to pay 12%."}
{"text":"This place is an interesting little BBQ joint. The crowd starts arriving after 5:30 and at 7, you need to wait one hour for a table - fear not, each table has a two hour limit! 

The meat here is tasty and it's all you can eat! Tips; get the number 1 and number 3 beef. 

Pro - tip - come before 5pm and get 10% off your bill!"}
{"text":"First time I went with my family on a Saturday night and we loved it! The cuts of meat were juicy, fatty, and flavourful. Second visit was on a Monday night and all the meats were super thin, not fatty, and sticking to the grill often. Due to the meat being so thin, it burned easily. The brisket, Kalbi, and porky belly all tasted different from the first visit. The difference between weeknight and weekend night is only $3 (29.99 vs 32.99) so do yourself a favour and go on the weekend. 

Veggies, bimbimbap, appetizers were all good. Dessert is Melona Popsicle or Creme brûlée. Again, Creme brûlée on Saturday was delicious with a nice hard crust but Monday was just sugar bits on top and totally under baked on top. Seems like effort on weekday night is really lacking. 

Overall it's still a decent BBQ place but without the nice cuts of meat, this place becomes common and doesn't leave you with desire to return"}
{"text":"Pretty good first experience here. Wait time is definitely long, we waited about an hour- arrived around 5:10ish pm? The waitress was really friendly and smiled a lot. We didn't have a problem with getting her attention when we needed something. She also changed our grill like two times without us asking and cleared any empty dishes. 

The quality of the food here is good! I didn't try any of the chicken but I particularly liked the kalbi, pork belly and pork cheek. The enoki mushrooms here are also super yummy and the sweet potato. The shrimp is pretty good too. The meat does cook relatively quickly while the vegetables like the zucchini take awhile. Be warned that the fire gets a bit scary though haha. I highly recommend eating the meat with the lettuce and adding some garlic, gochujang and kimchi. I also tried the bibimbap and cold noodles. The bibimbap was surprisingly really good, rice was cooked perfectly and the egg as well. There's some bean sprouts and a piece of seaweed in it along with gochujang. The cold noodles were mediocre (I'm just picky though lol). I like to have it with wasabi oil but this one is very simple with some kimchi and a slice of a boiled egg along with some sesame seeds. 

The creme brûlée is super yummy and really smooth and creamy. It's pretty small so I think u could easily eat 2 or more haha. I only got to eat one because I was really full and it was last call. Wasn't sure what to expect as it was my first time here. I don't really like that aspect where last call is 30 minutes before, you get 2 hours to eat. I guess it's to make sure that all food is finished within the time limit. We finished right on time. At the end of ur meal, u get a choice of mango or coconut flavour melona (I like the coconut). Tips are included at 12% and price is $40ish a person for dinner during the weekend/holiday. Left the place way too full (probably cause I ate rice too lol). Price is good once in awhile especially since the quality of the food is good. But super filling so I wouldn't come here often."}
{"text":"I think this place was hyped up way too much and I had very high expectations going in.  This place again deserves 3.5 stars because the food was good but just really not spectacular and usually, I only give 4-5 stars for places that blow my mind.  

Their menu includes meats (white meat, dark meat, seafood) as well as some appetizers and veggies.   Although the bibimbap may accelerate the process of filling you up, it is worth ordering one to share amongst people because that was actually quite good.  Their marinated kalbi was by far the best thing on the menu as well as their butter sweet corn.  Really, towards the end, that's all we ended up ordering.  

Weekend nights will run you around $40/person including tip.  My bill without drinks came to 80 something for two people.  For $40, I've been able to experience much better food and I think the problem with AYCE places is that they need to account for those giant eaters that will eat their money's worth.  Did we each eat $40 worth of food?  Definitely not.  So either come with some hungry monsters or find a place that has quality food and not quantity."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here. I was very amazed the first time but that was 6 months ago. I then went again when I wanted to eat like crazy but this time was a disappointment. The beef was sliced very thinly and not marinated enough. All the food seems to be cut very very tiny. I know it's all you can eat and don't want to be wasteful but the size of the food was way too small. After being cooked it was even smaller.  The desserts were good but I most likely won't come back due to taste and the wait time."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, amazing food and best part is.. no smell! The melona bar at the end was the best part, i would opt for lunch over dinner though due to the price because the lunch choices are still plentiful."}
{"text":"The food was very good, especially the Kalbi boneless short rib! The service was good too! But the dishes were very small, so the food will be gone so quickly then need to order another round. And all drinks (except water) are not included in the AYCE price. Their soda drinks actually taste really good!"}
{"text":"If you are big eater, it's a great place to go. Food quality is not bad. I would said this place is the best place for all you can eat. 
No reservations allow for party less than 6 and only accept cash or debit . Make sure you arrived around 6pm and bring enough cash."}
{"text":"Very bad experience, server's attitude is really bad... need more training on customer service."}
{"text":"I had their lunch for $17.99 on Tuesday and they start to add add butter corn , beef rib and Korean hot stone rice. Definitely a reasonable price for a lunch with good quality of meat. For the first time visitor, u can order a plate with everything and then start to order ur favorite. The ice cream after meal is cute and tasty.However, I do not think the price is reasonable for dinner since it looks a lot different types of meat , but for me I only eat certain type of them so lunch is good enough . Friendly reminder, it only accepts cash and debit ( luckily I brought cash that day since I normally only bring credits )"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with long waiting time. Fantastic sauce. However, eating time is always limited."}
{"text":"The good - I like to give this place a better score.  My first time at gyubee was a positive experience.  Meat was good, waitress was nice and positive with all the orders and replacing the burnt stove.  Just like other reviews recommended

The bad - However, it's unfortunate that I just found out they have a policy of not taking reservations unless you have a party or 6 or more on the phone.  The lady told me you can walk in instead.  I didn't even tell the lady the date of my reservation.  There is no indication on their website or yelp regarding the 6 people rule.

I think this isn't cool.  I know they have basically two dining windows every night.  The purpose of me making a reservation because my party is 5 people including a baby.  It will be a big frustration I have to wait with the baby for over an hour long at their restaurant or get a tiny table to put baby seat.  

So be alert, they may reject your reservation because you have a party of 5 or less.  Even then my first experience I had 7 people party and I waited at least 40 min on that Saturday night!!!"}
{"text":"Been here three times, however, not satisfying at all yesterday. First, we've been in Gyubee at 5:34(ten percent off before 5:30), so i asked them if we can still have the discount, and they said yes. However, we didn't get any discount when i paid for the bill, the woman at the bar just said she never mentioned it. Which is definitely not true, but i still paid for the full bill. 

Secondly, like i said i've been to the place several times because my girlfriend likes the beef tongue there. BUTBUTBUT, there was one server near our table, took all the plates away by the time I was still eating. I could only put all my stuff down, let him take all. Which is so RUDE and I have to say he makes me feel really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Their loss debt or cash only.  Good way to make sure business travelers don't eat here."}
{"text":"The meat quality is amongst the best for AYCE Barbeque in Toronto comparing to Chako and Korean village.

I like number 1 beef is my favorite. The number 6 beef, butter corn, clams and enoki are really yummy too. Crime brûlée is a must too.

Not a five star for the wait time. Waited for approximately an hour."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, I wish I could be the yelp duchess of this meat and flame castle...but my bank account and arteries reminds me to calm the **** down.
I've brought so many different people of different demographics here, relatives from out of town, super old school parents and hipster vegetarian-wannabe friends - everyone was impressed, so I was surprised by all the haters.
Meats are fresh and marbled, not as nicely marbled as when they first opened, but still definitely light years ahead of any AYCE competition. Personal favourites are paper thin, melt in your mouth beef tongue, chicken knuckles and pork cheek. All of which are rare cuts for AYCE bbqs. Their enoki mushrooms and sweet potato tins are also to die for.
Reason I like this place most is that it really offers foods for everyone that are a luxury compared to your run of the house AYCE. They have asparagus and oyster mushrooms for the healthy ladies; filling but special options like bibimbap and cold noodles; lettuce wraps with garlic you can roast; let's not forget the restaurant quality creme brûlée. 
The quality of their meats and sides are that of stand alone restaurants that would easily sell the same stuff for so much more. That is where the value is at and why I think their typical Asian service (aka \"rude\" servers) are perfectly justified. If you want A plus service, go to a Brazilian grill or a la carte restaurant.
That aside, expect a food coma or you didn't eat your money's worth."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday just after noon for lunch. We ordered the AYCE lunch ($19.99) with a seating limit of 1.5hrs and last call 20min prior.

The meats are definitely better than \"Korean bbq/Korean grill house\" and the restaurant is very clean. We ordered all the meats and veggies on the menu and notable were the beef short ribs and pork belly. Everything was delicious overall!

I find that the meat cooks a lot faster on the net grill compared to Korean bbq and the ventilation is a lot better.. my clothes hair did not smell of grease for days. 

The service was surprisingly exceptional. Our server was always nearby to give us tips or advise us that our food was ready and happy to take orders for additional food. Staff come by to change the grill halfway through without even being asked.

The bibimbap rice came in a cute little bowl as a personal portion and was delicious when paired with the sizzling meats.

Dessert was a choice if melona (strawberry or mango).. nice light touch to end the meal.

My only con is the time limit..it really limits you for a nice catch up session with friends...eat now talk later!!

PS. 12% tip is added to the bill. Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Would recommend and go back.. 

Dinner on a Saturday night was on special, $33/pp

Sapporo Pitchers are $12.99!!!!!!!

All in all, the food was good and price was ok.

Made a RSVP for 7 at 9pm on a Saturday, had to wait 15 minutes..

Once you still down, they ask if you have been before, if not, they serve everything on the menu to you.. The menu is pretty small tho

Serve was good.. Well staffed, 

Boneless short ribs and pork belly was good, sliced thin, easy to cook.

The grill was hot and food cooked fast!!

Even tho you will most likely try everything, my fav were the short ribs non-marinated, shrimp, squid, and pork belly.

Back of the restaurant was very very warm, bumped into some friends and they sat at the front of hr restaurant and it was much much cooler.

They automatically added 12% for our table of 7"}
{"text":"You might have to wait in line during weekend dinner. But it's worth it if you have the appetite for a BBQ feast."}
{"text":"So call is Japanese bbq, yes, maybe the grill itself is Japanese style, however, the meat n taste towards to Korean bbq style. They have two hours sitting limit so you have to rush to cook n eat. Maybe because there is a time limit so the grill was on full power all the time which keep you very busy cooking in order to prevent food over cook n burn. Thats the down side cuz i have no time to enjoy the food. When I left I would not say I was still hungry but for sure i was not full either
The food taste ok, meat are in good quality, kalbi, shrimp n beef tongue are basically what you only need to focus on, the rest are just soso...
Some staffs are well trained n the other knows nothing, so make sure you find a right person to ask for what u need.
At the end the service charge was included, but i would not mind to pay abit extra to the well trained server who taking care us."}
{"text":"Great food for AYCE and ok customer service. If you want to eat here, make sure you RSVP because the wait is long (30-1hr). They also restrict your seating time to two hours. The food is amazing, especially the Melona popsicle for dessert. Overall an amazing place to eat at and to bring a first date to if you don't mind the smell of BBQ afterwards."}
{"text":"Had lunch on a Sunday. Prices and lunch items have been updated, and the menu on their website is no longer correct (such as offering short ribs now for lunch/a bit higher price).

Food was pretty delicious, tender, and one of the better BBQ restaurants. Ordering through the waiter and food gets delivered to your table fast. 

Reason not a 5 star? The seating time. 1.5 hours for lunch felt way too rushed, and it's enforced quite strictly. Not much time to talk with friends, nor enough time to thoroughly enjoy the food. Felt like competing to eat food. 

Also small complaint is that they don't give you a bowl/dish to discard scraps (i.e. Shrimp tails, corn cobs, etc)"}
{"text":"I went there a couple of times, but it was because friends wanted to try. It was quite pricy with sitting time limit. I didn't feel the meats were any better than other bbq place, but some people seem to think so. It is not a bad restaurant, but I just wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"Best Japanese all you can eat bbq! We have been to all Jap BBQ , but this is the cheapest and best service place among all. Be prepared to wait if you are coming here for dinner. The service was fast. When our server was busy, other server always took the initiative to help us. Our server was trying his best to serve us above and beyond our expectation. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Wait time was very long but definitely worth the wait.  I like this place based on selection of meats you can't really find elsewhere in an ayce.  The best part too is the vegetable selection."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... but the quality of the service is just terrible. They were rushing us to order and finish so we can GTFO. The other tables that sat down before us didn't even get that treatment.... I understand that it's AYCE but the fact that the food came slow and quantity did not equate to what I ordered really made me mad. I never came out of a AYCE unsatisfied with not being full. In the last order I just ordered bimbimbap to stuff myself so I won't come out starving. I'm just giving it two stars cause the seasoning of the meat was good."}
{"text":"I've came here probably about five times. In all honesty this is my favorite all you can eat BBQ place. The meat quality is definitely better than other all you can eats. I'm only truly disappointed because I started coming here since the grand opening. The meat quality from the grand opening was far better than what they serve now. They're starting to downgrade but it's still better than the rest of the all you can eats around the GTA. My favorite thing to order is their marinated kalbi short ribs! I can literally eat 40 pieces of that without a problem. 

The service is great, the servers are very attentive for your wants and needs. After 6:30 there's usually a line up but they take reservations for a table of 6 or more. They only accept cash and debit with a 12% service fee. 

It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Busy ayce japanese bbq place had to wait for 45 mins but in the end everything paid off. Its a little higher than usual ayce but it was a great experience and the meat quality was good. Had the yuzu add a shot, didnt really taste like anything, better of getting the yuzu drink by itself. 
All in all would be back for this!"}
{"text":"well its been a while since my first visit here and can I just say, I will randomly crave this place.

even the remote thought of having Korean BBQ will trigger my craving for this Japanese BBQ joint.

we went for lunch but had the dinner menu, since there was more items on the dinner menu and it was a hit! I am truly grateful for my friend Tom introducing me to this place, I can't look back. I wish there was a location closer to me! Although, Markham isn't too far and without a doubt I would drive just to satisfy my craving, the price is high also, so gas and money is def a factor as to why I haven't been back any sooner.

are your health conscious? guess what, the have lettuce wraps, so cut your carbs out and order as much lettuce as you want because that grilled meat wrapped in the crunchy, succulent lettuce is the best thing I have ever had,

and a melona ice candy popsicle thingy add the nicest touch, but don't forget to try their creme brulee!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice and both times I've had a good experience. The price might play into factor for me tho. I would come here if I was terribly hungry that way I make sure I eat my moneys worth. 

The second time I went, it was lunch time however my guests and I decided that we would get the dinner menu at the time so that we get the 10% off. This way also we have a change to try all the items on the menu. 

The cuts of meat are nice and the side dishes are good. So when you feel like going out and cooking your own food, this should be a location for you to try at least once!"}
{"text":"Although we really enjoy the food here, we may have to look for other options. We came here at 7:20 on a Thursday night and didn't get seated until 9. It's absolutely ridiculous that this place does not take reservations unless you are a party of 6 or more. They have a great selection of meats and vegetables and the service is great but this place gets packed in the evening. I cannot bear waiting another 2 hours to sit down and eat a meal. Why not just take reservations over the phone like everywhere else? Also they don't accept credit, only debit and cash. It's 2018 people, how do you not accept credit cards?? Come on."}
{"text":"I think I'm in love with this place. The meat here is just so good and they give you lettuce to wrap it, which adds so much value to the experience.

I highly recommend going here at lunch before it's so much cheaper than dinner. I don't know what they could add during to make it that much better than lunch either.

Personally, I'd just eat the ribs here because the pork belly isn't really cut like normal pork belly. It's cut into thin slices of bacon. The grill is too hard so most of the finer cuts burn easily. Also, the ribs come without the bone unlike most other Asian AYCE BBQ places that leave it in.

Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the lettuce took a while to come in the beginning when all the food already came. Also, we received our miso soup at room temperature, which is extremely odd. We ordered a second round of soup and it came hot so I think it was just a mix up.

I paid $80 for 3 people with tax and tip included on a weekend. Not bad."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and food was good. But I had to give them a 2 because of what was stated above they kept rushing. I will not return. Considering I paid $40 after tax and tips. I was told by one waitress. It was last call for food. We said okay. Them asked if dessert was separate later on. She said yes. 2 minutes later. Another waitress came by and said last minute. We said we were told. We will get dessert after our last bit of food comes. She said no. You need to order your dessert now. (Which by the way was not all you can eat).   We said. Sure. Just give us two minutes to decide. And she literally stood there waiting. Horrible experience. Would never recommend it. Why would anyone go anywhere after being shooed away.  Also!  Because they forced us to take our dessert ASAP out ice real and Melona all melted when we started eating it. We were not even the last table there."}
{"text":"Food quality was great. Fast service and priced well. I would go to Gyubee over most Other bbq places."}
{"text":"Honestly, aside from a clean place and better quality of meat here than most other AYCE bbq joints, nothing stood out.  The part that still gets to me is what the heck makes this a JAPANESE BBQ?  Tasted exactly like a Korean BBQ joint.  Last time I checked, Bim Bam Bap isn't Japanese good.  Confused."}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite Asian BBQ place of all time. I came here for the second time for a close friend's birthday dinner and both me and the birthday girl left super full and happy!

The meat quality is the best here in my opinion compared to other bbq places like Chako. Rather than just beef, chicken, pork, or seafood, Gyubee actually offers different types of meat under each protein. The Beef section alone has different short ribs with different seasoning: house seasoning or black pepper. The beef tongue is also very tasty. My favorite to eat is their boneless short rib. Each piece is perfectly cut in thin slices of roughly 2*3 inch rectangles, easily cooked, easily enjoyable. You can see the beautiful marbling on each piece, and I get lots of satisfaction cooking them. Note that this boneless short rib is only available for dinner, but in my opinion this meat alone is worth it for the dinner price.

They have the standard soy sauce dipping sauce as well as a dry spice dip that on first look resembles the Japanese togarashi seven spice powder, but it also has a taste of cumin in it when I taste it. My favorite way of enjoying the meat is to dip it in soy sauce and then lightly dip in the dry spices. 

Gyubee offers creme brulee as well as Melona ice cream bars (mango and honeydew) for dessert, which are all pricier and higher quality compared to the noname brand ice creams deserts offered at other AYCE sushi or BBQ places. 

I was also quite pleasantly surprised by their cold noodle in the menu. It's listed together with bulgogi rice, and in the interest of not filling myself up with rice at an ayce BBQ place, I ordered the cold noodle to try. It comes in a miniature bowl with the basics of buckwheat cold noodle, kimchi and slice of boiled egg. I've got to say despite it's small size, the taste of these cold noodles is legit! Super refreshing with its cold sweet and sour broth, it was the better complement to BBQ meats compared to rice in my opinion. It also doesn't fill you up as much as a bowl of rice, so I can keep enjoying more grilled  meats, which is a win-win for me. 

This place is so popular they have a separate room near the entrance just for patrons sit while they're waiting for the next available table. Dinner times are especially busy, and seating time is limited to 2 hours. There's a 10% discount for any day of the week before 5pm, and a 12% gratuity is automatically calculated. The only thing I would suggest is for the restaurant is to staff more servers during busy times, as I had somewhat hard time flagging down a waitor when we wanted to order more food."}
{"text":"Saw my friend's comment on fb so I planned to have mother's day dinner with parents here.  Since it's Friday so I called in advance to see if I can make a reservation and turns out the lady asked me to try my luck walk-in.  Glad I did and wait around 15-20 mins for my table.  To be honest, this place is more expensive compared to other AYCE grilled restaurant, but the quality is better so I think worth it though.  Actually surprise me is that the miso soup, cold noodle and the beef with rice taste good.   


2nd review

Been here after 2 weeks with friends and this time our server speaks cantonese and very smart.  Like the first time, everything is good and we tried the special non-alcohol drink and taste quite good (but I don't remember what is it though)."}
{"text":"Given that the sign is sitting behind a tinted window, the location is a little bit hard to find. I took a turn in the last plaza before the 404 (heading south on woodbine) and luckily stumbled upon the restaurant. 

It was just a few minutes after opening on a Sunday and people were already pouring in for lunch!! Id recommend getting there early or else you'll just have to wait..potentially for a while

Started with a couple bibimbaps- they were pretty simple but I liked them. I got a couple for myself :)

Pretty much right after ordering, we ordered every meat on the lunch menu, and pretty much everything else too (very hungry..as usual). While all the meats were really good, the short rib is the winner for me. It always is. SO TENDER. SO JUICY. SO GOOD. Once again, the other meats were good... just not as good as the spare rib

The nice thing about the thinly sliced meat is that you can eat it as per usual with rice, or you can give the lettuce a shot. To be honest- after doing the whole wrap thing with the lettuce at Gyubee and enjoying the hell out of it, Ive been doing it at home too...

Price for lunch on a Sunday was about $55.00 (including tax and tip) for 2 people. Also, keep in mind that they automatically add a 12% tip."}
{"text":"Decor: 4
Food: 5
Service: 4

I called about a week in advance to make sure they had tables for the 7 of us.  They only had two time slots: 6:30pm or 8:00pm so we took the 6:30pm.

My first impression about this place was that there wasn't enough lighting. It was dimmer than other korean bbq places.  The seats were a bit tight; I had to tilt my body inorder for my legs to feel comfortable.

Our server asked if it was our first visit and when we said yes, she suggested that we order one dish of each item to see if we liked it or not.  I found a free cocktail coupon in the chinese 701 magazine so it was a bonus for all of us.  The cocktails were roughly $4 each so we got $30 of free drinks! (They were pretty good actually...)

Food came quick and they were delicious! My favourites were the Kalbi short ribs, pork belly, enoki and corn.  The Bibimbap and cold noodles were surprisingly good and big portions!

Creme Brulee was amazing.. I would have ordered more if I wasn't that full lol

We would definitely come back but I think I would limit the number to 4 people to get a comfy table."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place tonight which I had planned coming a month ago with some friends.  There were 8 of us and they had these large booths that sits 8 people perfectly with two grills.   This is Japanese BBQ AYCE which is similar to Korean BBQ AYCE places but the grill is a bit different which I think it's a better grill as the meats doesn't over cook so quickly.  Also, the beef, chicken and pork meats are better quality.   Our favourite dishes were the boneless short rib, pork belly, squid and shrimp.  The bibimbap (Korean veggie rice with fried egg) was also a nice item on the menu.  I also suggest you get the lettuce with the Korean sauce to make your beef wrap...so good!  

It's a bit pricey but it's all you can eat.  If you don't mind eating early, book the 5:30pm and get the 10% off discount but you must arrive before 5:30pm.  I wasn't too please about them charging my daughter the adult price.  She is under 12 but they also have a height limit and since she is over 55\", she had to pay adult price. Although the food and service was pretty good, paying extra for my daughter will probably discourage us from coming on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I arrived at Gyubee at 7pm and it was pretty busy. I couldn't make any reservations because the lady on the phone said they only take reservations at 6pm or 8pm...I don't know why. 

I talked to a hostess to get a table for 6 and she said it'll take an hour and a half, but then another host helped me out and said it'll only take less than an hour. So I guess make sure you talk to someone who looks really organized or try to check up on your wait time. The host was able to direct me to a waiting lounge or something so I could sit and he gave me the food/drink menus while I wait.  

After waiting for more than an hour and frequently asking when our table was ready and after strictly talking to the hostess, we got the table. The hostess said I should've made a reservation....then I told her that I was told I couldn't and was told i should just walk in....

Besides the sad service, the rest of the experience was pretty good. Our table was pretty spacious and good. We had to wait a few minutes for our server to take our orders. There was no iPad or paper/list we could jot down our order, just straight verbal ordering with our server. Throughout the night, servers would attend to us, but not as frequent as I would like.

For food, I really liked their short rib options, shrimp, and sausage. The squid was okay. Every other meat item was not bad but not that great. I always do prefer beef over any other meat when it comes to bbq-yourself restaurants. They have a great variety of appetizers, especially the sweet potato, cabbage, mushrooms, corn, salmon, and cold tofu!! The bibimbap wasn't that great.

Another perk is that we are allowed as many changes for our grill(wire) surface. Pretty sweet so we don't have to eat the burnt shards from the meat.

Also, desserts were good too. I wish I've gotten more crème brûlée and it sucks that we are only allowed one melona bat. I got mango and it was good.

Overall, the experience was good except for the service which really burdened the whole experience."}
{"text":"Ok. So the hype is a little real. But the eating time: not really cool (2 hrs only; no more orders, at all). If you're nice enough, your server mighttt let you order a few extra dishes if you pass the last call mark, or give you some more desserts. 

First things first - parking. The lot isnt huge so either come early, wait, or park far. Tip: BOOK in advance. Most of the time you'll get a seat if you arrive at the designated time, otherwise risk the wait.

For those of you who havent been to Japanese/Korean bbq, the concept is basically putting the raw meat/veggies/seafood on the stove and cook it. Yup, thats it. Sometimes the meat can be too thin or tough, but this place has it pretty juicy and tender, which justifies their popularity and line ups. 

Service is efficient; food ordered comes fast, which is needed when your eating time is literally ticking every second. One of their small dishes that I thought was pretty cute and good were their fries, which comes in a small tin foil bowl so you can heat it directly on the stove. Its a bit sweet, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Their menu isnt huge but its enough for what you need to order for the main dishes of J/Kbbq.

Come dessert time you get 2 choices - popsicle or creme brulee. If you have a larger group, you have the advantage of trying both. The creme brulee was pretty good but considering the heat level at the restaurant the popsicle wasnt a bad idea.

So remember. If you're planning on coming here, especially with a group, book a table and come on time. And to maximize your dinner time, order fast!"}
{"text":"Tldr: food (5/5). Service (3/5). AYCE bbq at another level, would recommend

Right off the bat I just want to say that Gyubee is not your ordinary, run of the mill bbq joint. It's a safe haven for hungry souls that crave a wide selection of high quality meats at the AYCE level. Might be a lengthier review haha but feel free to look at the subsections. 

Food (5/5):
Gyubee boasts of their 100% certified Angus beef and libreterre organic pork. To an amateur food enthusiast, that doesn't really mean much haha... But the moment a perfectly grilled piece of meat enters my mouth, tears of joy and ecstasy start to flow down my face.

The Beef: In my opinion, the beef is the bread and butter of this place. They offer two types of kalbi (beef short ribs), beef brisket, and beef tongue. I personally loved the kalbi and beef brisket. These cuts were fresh and beautifully marbled, like an exquisite piece of art that just melts in your mouth. Flavors were extremely savory and rich as is, so don't you dare taint it by dipping that succulent beef into soy sauce. 

The Pork: Gyubee offers pork belly, pork cheek, and pork shoulder. These cuts were pretty good if you're looking for that pork fix. From what I remembered, the pork was quite flavorful as well, though it was on the fattier end (esp pork belly). I might just be biased because I loved the beef so much haha. But don't hesitate to try the pork as it won't disappoint either. 

The Chicken: Chicken thigh and knee cartilage was on the menu, but didn't really speak to me...why you might ask? Because over the years of my AYCE bbq experiences, chicken literally takes 10 years to cook, and ain't nobody got time to cook chicken when you're on a time limit (more on this later). 

The Seafood: Nothing really interesting here since it's just squid and shrimp. But if you're into that, I ain't judging. 

The Veggies: They offer a bunch of veggie options as well...Though if you're a vegetarian this is obviously not the place for you. My favorites out of this section of the menu would be the honey sweet potatoes and enoki mushrooms that come in a cute tiny tin that you put directly on the grill to heat them up (The enokis come with a slab of butter that just mixes so well with the sweet/salty seasoning \"juice\" and original mushroom flavors....SO GOOD) The other unique veggie selections that caught my eye and taste-buds were the asparagus and king oyster mushrooms. You will definitely not see these options at a Chako or a Korean grill house. 

Dessert: Sadly they don't have your usual green tea/mango/red bean ice creams, but they do offer melona (A Korean ice cream-like fruit popsicle) and crème brulee (which I believe they make in-house).  At this point you're probably super full and hating yourself for eating so much meat, but hey... there's always room for dessert. 

Service (3/5): 
This is probably the reason why I'm not giving Gyubee an overall rating of 5/5. The service here is ok, but what can you expect from an AYCE establishment. The couple of times that I've been here, the waiting time for a table has been ridiculously long (approx. 1-2hrs, depending on party size and time of arrival). The people working at the front desk also look real stressed and can sound relatively rude at times. They don't take your phone number to call you when a table is ready either, so get ready to have someone on standby in the waiting area when they call the name you gave them. 

If you can get past the wait, most of the servers are quite friendly and bring your food/drinks at a reasonable time. The servers use ipads to take your order, and they glitch out from time to time. The servers also strongly enforce the 2 hour seating/eating limit, and last call was 30 mins before the limit. I also personally didn't like how they rushed us to finish our meal and desserts. An automatic 12% service charge fee is also added to your bill. 

The price here is also not a joking matter. The price for an adult is $29.99 (before tax/tip), and $32.99 for weekends and holidays. So be prepared to see your money magically grow wings and fly out of your wallet. 

Final thoughts: 
Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Gyubee. This place is great for all ages, for any occasion. I've come back a couple of times, and would definitely keep coming back. Just not too often because you do feel quite heavy and bloated as you leave the place....and it's expensive haha... Indulge away friends!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and it was sooooooo worth the wait. Our wait time was about an hour and a half. I got here at 6:25pm and we were seated at 7:30pm which I was told- was pretty good. The others that came after me were told 2 to 3 hours wait time. I never been here before so I really didn't mind waiting.

This Korean bbq place compared to Korean grill house or chakos- is soooooo much better in comparison. Better quality meats, better side dishes, better seating, better service and better drink menus!

The boneless kalbi was to die for. It was sliced thin and melted in your mouth goodness. The marinated house kalbi was also very delicious. A bit tooo thick but still so good. The pork butt was like bacon. Cooked very quickly and crisped up pure yummy ness. I was a huge fan of their kimchi and their bean sprouts. Their cabbage slaw wasn't too bad either. Their presentation for each meat tray was pretty impressive, not like most places that just slater the meat on the trays. I was surprised they didn't have any chilli oil but do try their salt mixture seasoning. It's so delicious and it was a nice blend of different seasoning, mostly cumin I think.

The only thing that I wasn't too fond about was the bibimbap. It was tooooo sweet for my liking but amazing portions for those who want to try it out.

Their drink menus are pretty impressive. Do try their lychee mojito! Sooooo delicious and all of their cocktail drinks are 5 bucks and in good portions! 

I love the atmosphere of the place, it was very intimate, sectioned off of other tables which was very nice. The lighting was perfect. Tables super clean and very clean grill. 

The price is pretty expensive but don't forget you are paying for the quality of the meat. It is sooooo worth it. Monday to Thursday it's 30.99 for dinner and 34.99 on weekends.

Service was impeccable and food was delicious. Definitely worth the hour wait and the price. Dooooo come here on an empty stomach and try everything! 

Happy eating fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"It's kinda funny. I told my friends I wanted to come to this place because I thought it's the same Gyubee as the one in downtown Toronto. Turns out its a complete different restaurant, not a franchise and it's all you can eat. Came here on a weeknight for dinner, $30. Strict 2 hr seating time which starts counting the moment you get seated. It's pretty expensive for an all you can eat bbq, but the quality of the meat was really good. You can tell they serve fresher ingredients. The meats are not marinated, so it's all about dipping into the soya sauce or adding the chili spices for flavor. Aside from the BBQ food (meat and vegetables), they also have appetizer and other side dishes. The salmon carpaccio was good. The Bibimbap was surprisingly tastey too. I like how they give small portions so you can try a bit of everything. 

One thing that I found really strange was they said if you don't finish your food they weigh the leftover food and charge per 100g."}
{"text":"Food is OK
12 percent tips is mandatory. 
Only allowed one Popsicle per person 
bit pricey and not much selection"}
{"text":"I wish I could have given 4.5 but there's no half option. We booked for a group of 10 on a Tuesday night and they were very accommodating. Didn't start the time until all of us arrived. 

For an all-you-can-eat the food was very good. The short ribs and pork belly were my favourites. You can taste the difference in quality of the meat both from taste and texture. The cuts are noticeably more tender and juicy. However if you're accustomed to getting larger slices of meat you may way to double or even triple your order. Most of the cuts are very small, and when you order it's per bite sized piece.

The service far surpassed my expectations. I saw a few reviews saying they were rushed during their meal and that staff was rude and inattentive. In my experience, they were prompt, swift and friendly. When we asked for grill changes, and extra food, they were done quickly with no questions asked. And we must have asked for extras 10+ times.

Overall the bill ran close to $40 each, tip(12%) and tax included. Food was good, service was good. Seemed a little bit pricey, but it was worth the splurge."}

{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with a couple of friends.
it was very nice and modern inside.
Service was good. Our server would teach us how each meat should be grilled 
Food came fast

There is a two hr limit.
everything was really fresh 
but pricey around $40 a person with tip

recommend:
Bibimbap
Kalbi boneless short ribs
Hourse marinated kalbi short ribs
Shrimp
Enoki mushrooms

for dessert you only get 1 melona per person but they also have creme brulee"}
{"text":"First time going here I wasn't sure what to except, it here thinking typical BBQ place but I was mistaken. All the meats and dishes that they have to offer taste so delicious with so much flavour. They are cut just right that the cook time isn't too long especially if you are hungry and just want to eat. It has a great atmosphere to just have a good time while enjoying a great meal. My only concern is that it's quite pricey than other BBQ places I've been to but with the quality of meat that's being served I feel it's worth it."}
{"text":"Probably my absolute favourite AYCE Asian bbq experience in the GTA. I find myself ordering round after round of gloriously delicious meat without fatiguing as I would at your average ayce KBBQ. And even non-meat items such as the cold noodles with the hardboiled egg and kimchi, I knocked back 5 of those without so much a blink or a burp. Place is modern, well-ventilated, and very clean. Service is reasonably attentive and prompt, with the occasional error taking orders. Definitely looking forward to go back and/or checking out their downtown location."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Marinade was well done and delicious. The only thing I didn't like was the chicken thigh, but personal preference. 

Service: 1/5 
Weekday afternoon, many seats available so they weren't busy, but we still had difficulty calling someone over to order more. After calling them over, they'd ask us to wait and proceed to forget that we were waiting to order more food. They also never refilled our water. 
When we got the bill (wanted to pay in cash), they immediately took the bills and left (while we were grabbing coins/change) so we had to get up and follow them to the front to give the coins. 

Price: 1/5 
This location is charging holiday/weekend prices starting early December through early January (Jan 4th I believe). We visited on a WEE afternoon for the cheaper 19.99 lunch price but had to pay holiday/weekend price; if we had known, we wouldn't have eaten here. Regardless, holiday pricing for MORE than a month duration is a bit ridiculous. Even university students don't get a month off for the holidays. A week or two would would be understandable ... but the entire month of December and first week of January? Wow that's a lengthy holiday! 

Overall, food is good. But not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is very good Japanese BBQ. Their meat is very tasty and service is excellent I would 100% come back again !"}
{"text":"I would never go to this place if the choice was mine. But even then I had to go twice because of friends. It is ayce and the meat quality is decent but as a bbq restaurant they are not even making an effort to make their food taste good. Just \"serve\" you unseasoned meat with the typical Korean style bbq dip you can find at any Korean restaurant but without all the other choices authentic Korean places offer. Then charge a 300% markup depends on how much you eat. I mean I can just buy meat and Korean sauce from h-mart and invite my friends over for 1/3 the price (what's the point of this restaurant). 

Normally I would just give a place like this a 2 star since I don't really care about service in Asian places but I had to -1 star because of the idgaf attitudes of the servers. They just asked us to leave as soon as our table time is up. No reminder, just something along the lines of \"times up guys, you gotta go\". Also they don't mention about the auto-gratuity until you see it on your bill most of the time. (I think it was 13% or something) so basically you ended up paying for the non-existent service anyway."}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything kalbi! But no hot sauce??? This place really needs to get some hot sauce because some of the meats def needed the kick and hot sauce is life.

I probably wouldn't come back here for dinner as I don't see the value for the high price. The tiny desert Creme brûlée were amazing though!"}
{"text":"5/5 service
5/5 food quality 
3/5 price

30$ per person and only 2 hour seating limit. The portion sizes are small-like sample sizes. Service was very quick and helpful servers provided a great experience."}
{"text":"Mmm MMMM mAmazing. 

I love love the meat here. Their kalbi beef was thinly sliced and well marbled, its a great experience for the tongue. For an ayce restaurant, thats a great price for the quality of meats they serve. Plus their service is great, prompt and friendly. Give melona ice cream when done. Bonuss~

It does get packed for dinner times so make sure you arrive early! Plus they have a seating limit so order all you can before last call. Definite recommend to all meat lovers"}
{"text":"I've been to Gyubee three times and usually my experience is great, but last Thursday I got food poisoning after eating there.

Their location is a bit difficult to find, underneath a business complex and doesn't have too many parking spots. Their decor is nice, food is pretty good quality, but service can be a hit or miss. There aren't many J-BBQ restaurants in Toronto, and especially because it's all you can eat, it stands out. It's pretty pricey compared to other all you can eat options in the area, but if you compare the quality to other all you can eat BBQs (chako, Korean grill house) it's worth it. 

The service can be a bit spotty. I've had amazing servers here that check up every 10 minutes to see how we're doing. Last Thursday there was one specific waitress that kept spilling the liquid from the raw pork belly every time she was serving it to the table (the first time, on my boyfriend's seat, and the second time on the table near the side dishes/water). I'm assuming that's how I got food poisoning. 

I want to love this place but they should probably be more careful about cross contamination especially considering there's lots of raw meat involved. I definitely won't be coming back for a while."}
{"text":"Service is very good and I like the small portion of the food. But waiting time is long."}
{"text":"I like the concept - 2 hours - $30.99 - AYCE. Don't be overwhelmed by the menu - these staff are great but obviously try to get you to start with their \"mixed platter\" which lets you sample everything. We didn't fall for it - and went straight for the Beef (with a few shrimps and pork belly). 

The kalbi boneless ribs are unreal. High quality beef albeit sliced very thin (much thinner than Korean BBQ). I really like the sides - the buttered corn on the cob pieces, slaw, miso soup, kimchi, mushrooms and sweet potatoes in tinfoil cups ready to warm up on the grill. The grill itself is plenty hot and can handle all your grilling needs. 

The place was packed on a Wednesday night - which was good to see. It's been open about a year and the manager said most nights they are full. No reservations for parties under 6. 

We didn't try the chicken - but all 4 beef dishes were excellent - and so were the sides and shrimp. The house marinated kalbi was not too sweet - we liked it. The pepper beef was pretty good too. Best though was the boneless kalbi. 

I will be back :)"}
{"text":"If the restaurant doesn't want to allow reservations, then it better knows how to properly estimate the wait time. And it should have the courtesy to call people if customer is willing to wait nearby. It's ridiculous a restaurant makes customers wait for 2 frigging hours and makes it seem normal. If the restaurant keeps on letting people walk out of the door because of long wait, it won't stay open for long. It's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place! A little bit pricey but worth it!!! Love the quality of their meat and seafood. Surprisingly good bibimbap. Yummy desserts (melona for lunch and creme brûlée for dinner). Quick and good service. One of our favorite AYCE bbq place!"}
{"text":"I will give this place 5 out of 5 for the food selection, quality, and taste, for an AYCE place! Good prices for drinks and beer, but a tad pricey overall. One thing I'd have to knit pick on is the fact that if you had a reservation for 6 people you are able to make a reservation - great! HOWEVER, if the 8 person tables are empty and you only have 6 people, they won't seat you there. Yet, they have 6 person tables that are/can be divided with a wooden fence barrier into 4-person and 2-person tables. So, why not divide the 8 person table if needed? Just a thought.

Service unfortunately wasn't the greatest. Maybe the staff or employee in our section was new or in training. I've been here maybe 3-4 times in the last 6 months. There were items we had to ask for a second time because it took a long time to arrive, and there were 2-3 items that just never came that we eventually gave up on.

The choice of meats is really good, especially the boneless short rib MARINATED kalbi! Definitely my favourite along with the shrimp! If you look in other photos you'll see the enoki mushrooms given in a silver tin bowl to cook over the Japanese style grill, I usually cook the shrimp in the butter after eating the mushrooms! Definitely recommended you try doing that haha.

I can't say I've had plain white rice here because there is Bibimbap with a decent sauce and recipe, with a sunny side up egg on it! How can you go wrong. Seriously. I know they claim it's Japanese style BBQ, but it's not lol. The only thing Japanese about it is pretty much the grill. The rice isn't even sushi rice but that won't stop me from getting AYCE bibimbap with an egg or two.

I still recommend this place for what you get! 
Just be aware of the stupid logistics when it comes to not being seated with a 6-person reservation and slow service sometimes."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night at 630, and it was packed (obviously). The wait time from that point was 1 hour and 45 minutes for a table of 2. Once it reached around 7 they would start turning people away if they sense that the wait time was going to be absurd. Which is quite considerate (in my opinion). Also, there is no booking of tables for parties less than 6. 

Going into the restaurant, you can see they designed a HUGE lobby, which takes up more space that could have been used to serve customers, again in my opinion, it looked like a waste. 

We finally sat down, and they already have people hovering ready to take your order. The total stay time was 2 hours. They try to have a quick turnover, so you will see ALOT of servers around the restaurants. We ordered one of every meat, and it came really quickly. Again, they want you out by the 2 hour mark. All the meat are NOT marinated other than the kalbi, which in turn made the other meat tasteless. The veggies were great, the enoki mushroom came in a tin, I'd suggest you make the veggies in there. 

On the table there are two things for dipping sauce, one type of powder, spicy and one semi sweet soy sauce which wasn't too salty. The quality of the meat was pretty good,at least it wasn't overly salty from the marinating. There are other non-bbq dishes like kimchi, cold tofu, miso soup, etc. If you need carbs there is bibimbap and cold sobs noodles. 

You get reminded at the 1.5 hour mark that you have to make a last call, which INCLUDES dessert. Dessert we ordered creme brûlée, which was not a must have. Then at the two hour mark, they offer you your choice of Melona bar, then a whirlwind of people come and clean up your table, and then someone comes with a machine for your payment. They really want you out of there.

For the price, i don't think it's really quite worth it. It's more novelty as they call it Japanese BBQ, but it's a combination of Japanese and Korean. So it's not really that special. And basically how they have timed everything, you don't really get to eat comfortably as you know the time is ticking on you. 

You could try it for the sake of \"I've tried it\", but you can just go eat KBBQ somewhere else and enjoy your time."}
{"text":"The price is reasonable but the food quality here caused me to have a food allergy... And I rarely get allergic so that means something...
If you want to find a cheap place for all you can eat BBQ, here is the place to go. But if you're asking for a nice decent BBQ , just go to gyukaku instead."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy!! 
I greatly enjoyed my visit to Gyubee! 

TLDR: mediocre service, expensive, decent quality meats, new grilling experience! 

My friends and I came to Gyubee for lunch on a weekend.   We arrived at 12pm (when it opened), and the seats were already half full! 
They will give you an option for having the dinner menu during lunch, and will give you 10% off if you chose to have the dinner menu. We stuck with the lunch menu as  there wasn't too much of a difference (and we'd have to pay around an extra $10/person even with 10%). For lunch, you have a seating limit of 1.5hrs, and dinner is 2hrs. 
We ordered everything on the menu (kalbi, beef brisket, pork belly, chicken, shrimp, sausage, zucchini, mushrooms, butter corn, lettuce, bibimbap, and miso soup, AND all the side dishes ~ kimchi, bean sprout, coleslaw, cold tofu, and edamame). I can't complain about the meat, it was great, especially the kalbi! 
The service was kinda rushed, I also didn't think some of the servers understood what we asked for. They also mixed up some of our orders with other tables and forgot to bring us some of the things we ordered. 

Overall, this is a great place for people who would like to indulge in an unlimited supply of protein. To compare,  quality is much better than Chako - the grill is also different. 
Another upside is that your clothes don't reek BBQ after! 

Will definitely visit another time!"}
{"text":"Food was just decent to be honest. Service wasn't up to expectations. Walked in on a Saturday evening and was told that the wait was 40-60 minutes, which we were fine with, and left them with my name. It was finally our turn, \"Julie\", they called and had us seated. The waiter introduced himself and started recommending the items we should order since it was our first time visiting the place. We took his suggestion and ordered. The hostess came over in a very hostile manner and said \"You are not supposed to be seated. This table is for someone else.\" When I asked them why they had called for \"Julie\", they said it was for another \"Julie\", one for a table of 7 when we were only a table of 5. Well.....did I know that? No. And of course we were all comfortable, and now we get booted out like we \"stole\" the seats without an apology. The hostess gave us nasty stares and after much questioning of why we had to leave the spot we got called to, then said \"well I'm sorry, okay?!?!\". Horrible service. Decent food. Not worth $33.99 per person + tax + tips."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday for their AYCE lunch. I was a bit worried after reading all these reviews about their strict 2 hour policy but luckily we weren't rushed during our meal. We got a table around 1:30 and stayed until 4 without getting booted. Probably because we came after peak hours and there were a lot of tables available by then. 

Our party of 5 was given two grills which you can easily adjust on the side of the table. To start we ordered a bit of everything on the menu so we could try all the meat options along with the bibimbap, edamame, bean sprouts, and cold tofu. All of the meat is cut very thinly so it only takes a few second for it to cook but also makes it so easy to burn a quality cut of meat if you're not too careful! 

I really enjoyed the chicken but the standout was definitely the kalbi beef. A perfectly grilled slice of kalbi beef wrapped in lettuce is so satisfying when you're hungry. There are also some veggie options for lunch too. Once we had our fill of meat we ordered slices of zucchini, corn and mushrooms to even things out. Sadly, the enoki mushrooms in butter was only available on their dinner menu so we didn't get a chance to try that. For dessert we were all given either a choice of strawberry or honeydew Melona which is a great way to end the meal!

All in all, we had a good time grilling our own food. The service isn't terrible but when one of the servers accidentally gave us a dinner item he came back to our table to take it back to the kitchen ten minutes later. Luckily we had already grilled some pieces by then. 

It's a bit on the expensive side but definitely a fun place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Came here on a monday, price after tax and 12% gratuity comes out to $38/person.  The meat quality for all you cam eat is top notch, the non marinated short ribs are nicely marbled, it cooks quick and melts like butter in your mouth.  The quality of meats here are even better than most a la carte korean bbq.  Service was fast and attentive.  Definitely my new goto place.  If you come on a weekend, it's $3 more for same menu.  

Since orders are per piece, they stress the charge for unfinished items and enforce the 2hr limit.  Their desserts listed ice creams but seems they were out and had melona popsicles.  And they also have creme brule.

Just to give an idea on comparison of chako and gyubee, i usually dont even bother ordering short ribs at chako.  At gyubee i basically filled up on regular boneless short ribs."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good for ayce quality. We went during lunch on a Sunday and we had to wait around 45 mins for our table so it's best to come right when it opens (noon) to get the first round! Out of all the items on the menu I liked the kalbi boneless short rib the best. It was very tender and flavour was marinated nicely. They also have unlimited little bowls of bibimbap, but I can't get past two bowls every time I go! The servers are all very nice and pretty attentive. They came to the table occasionally to ask if we would like to order more food. Make sure to ask for a grill change during the middle of your meal if it starts to burn. Comes with a melona bar (honeydew or mango) at the end but unfortunately that is not unlimited!"}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 7. Reserved for 6:30, was seated at 6:40, not bad. Tried ordering everything. Here are some thoughts:

Pros:
-Ventilation is great. Don't have to worry as much about food smell on clothes as most asian BBQ places
-kalbi is very good quality. Superb marbling.
-service was on point and got all orders correct.
-the Korean items like bibimbab, cold noodles and kimchi, were suprisingly good. Actually, everything there was good *drools*

Cons:
- fire uneven due to charcoal.. but you knew that
-The charcoal is really close to the grill so certain meat will burn fast. I'm looking at you pork cheek and chicken cartilage.
-the food that comes in the tinfoil trays take up too much grill real estate.
-meat is cut very small and thin so you have to cook non-stop to get your fill in 2 hours. Especially if there's 4 people per grill

My top favourite menu items:
-boneless galbi
-marinated galbi
-shrimp
-cold noodles
-creme brulee"}
