{"text":"The food was good, but the service was slow. We were seated and waited over 15 minutes to get a waiter. It seemed like some of the waitresses had no idea what they were doing.  The manager needs to step up and give more direction to their employees.  They need to be more attentive to their customers once they seat them. I will go back because the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Being from SoCal, I was excited that there was a new Mexican restaurant here on Cleveland's west side. Unfortunately, my dining experience there was the worst I've ever experienced. Someone came by the table and snatched away the menus before we ordered. The waitress was unfamiliar with the menu and was unable to comprehend what we wanted. Apparently the only way to order is by number. Somehow I ended up with something I didn't want and couldn't eat. All the food at our table was lukewarm and looked like it had been prepared some time ago. None of the staff noticed that there was a full plate of food at the edge of the table and we did not see our waitress again until we stopped someone running by our table and asked them to find her for us. Finally, she laid our check right next to the plate of uneaten food and said she would take the payment when we were ready. When I commented I didn't like the food, she just said \"sorry\". If it weren't for the chips and salsa, I would have left hungry. In general, the staff seemed disorganized and harried. Food and service were both awful. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Horrible service the worst. Even after asking for help from another waiter. Still horrible service. Such a shame. Nice clean place. It's empty on a Sunday at 1. Food amazing. Service beyond recovery??"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place one evening before seeing the new dino movie. The salsa was good, served with a big bowl of chips, but the rest of the food was very average. My wife's seafood enchilada was listed as scallops, but it was obviously imitation."}
{"text":"I would have liked to comment on the service and the food but there wasn't any!!!  NONE! EVEN IF THE FOOD IS GOOD YOU'D NEVER KNOW BECAUSE YOU CANT GET SERVED.  Nope.   Never coming back or trying this again.   I walked out after waiting 15 minutes.   No water, nothing!   Oh, I did get a menu."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Fresh and delicious! Amazing Blood orange margarita! My new favorite Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday for $1.25 tacos (not all proteins) and $3.00 margaritas!  I ordered a chorizo, steak, and an al pastor taco.  The al pastor was definitely my favorite and then it was the chorizo and then the steak.  The reason why I liked the al pastor the most is because it had more flavor packed into every bite compared to the other two.    My husband, friend, and I sat at the bar and we got service right away.  Our drinks were served promptly (probably within 5 minutes from when we first sat down) and our tacos were served nice and hot in 10 minutes.  I looked at other reviews and I read a lot of horrible service reviews which was kind of upsetting so I needed to justify it myself.  The place wasn't too busy at 7pm in a Tuesday.  The restaurant is fairly new so I expected the service and food not to be perfect which blew me out of the water when it was.  They have a nice selection of tequila which goes perfectly with my variety of tacos.  The bartenders were very attentive to my needs.  They also have spicy salsa available for your tacos if you would like that gives your taste buds a kick.  Honestly I'm not so sure how things would be if it got busy, but expect to wait a little longer because this food is definitely worth the wait.  Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Well well well Brooklyn has a pretty good good New Mexican Restaurant. The inside of this place is very nice has a bar with more tequila then I know what to do with! Very nice bar and ambiance ! I purposely came at 12 pm lunch hour to see how efficient they was while they were busy they seemed to handle ok a few hick ups I noticed but I was observing the food that was coming out it looked great . I ordered number 32 on the menu which is the steak chorizo burrito, tasted excellent the steak had a slight char and seasoning was spot on . They had this green poblano sauce on the table hot stuff. It was served with guacamole, lettuce , tomato, and sour cream ! It was great! The end of the Burrito the chorizo had a little too much char on it but that's ok I forgive u! I'm gonna give 4 stars because I ordered tacos to go they give me chicken instead of ground beef . There seems to be the usual hick ups with a new restaurant but folks I think you need to try this place . Bar looks killer Teqqqqqquuuiilaaa! No outdoor seating yet looks like they are in process of setting up patio!"}
