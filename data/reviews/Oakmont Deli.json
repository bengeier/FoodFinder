{"text":"Everything is fresh and I have not found something from there I dont like. My sons who are picky eaters also lovvvve the deli. So that got to say a lot lol ... we often take walks down there if a staff member sees me coming in pushing a stroller they open the door . Which says a lot this day in age since not a lot of people do that anymore. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place has great quality lunch meats and steaks. The sandwiches are awesome! As for the price if you want good quality food you have to pay for it! $10 for a whole meal and a drink that is good quality and not bad for you seems fine to me!"}
{"text":"Delish food! Great service. Quaint little place we stopped at while visiting. Would go back again in a heartbeat. Husband has the Italian sandwhich and I had French Dip. Yum!"}
{"text":"Quality food, cool atmosphere, super convenient. Love all the homemade stuff, never disappointed. Even a water bowl for your dog to have a sip while walking. Only complaint is the price for the portion sizes. If you're like me and don't like chains (Panera, ugh!) this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The deli sandwiches are great.  The meat and toppings taste fresh.  The Buffalo chicken is great and is what I usually get.  Their Italian sandwich is pretty tasty as well.  Their chili is bad.  It is watered down and the meat is overcooked.  This is a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Sandwich was very good. A nightmare to earth. Everything plastic and styrofoam...Fast efficient service..."}
{"text":"Great little place in Oakmont. Nice selection of 'deli stuff' , good steaks and home of the David's sammich. Try one- you'll be back"}
{"text":"My four stars are for the atmosphere, it's a quaint little deli,clean and staffed with friendly people and with a very good selection of typical deli foods. My criticism is that the portion size does NOT justify the exorbitant prices that the Oakmont Deli charge for there product , and how they nickel and dime you for every little thing on the sandwich. I ordered an egg salad sandwich and when it arrived I thought the  chickens had died or there was an egg salad shortage, this sandwich had hardly enough egg salad to cover the bread and was absent the bacon I ordered to go on the sandwich. After paying my bill i.felt totally ripped off and felt that I  was way over charged for what I ordered and what I got.  This might just be the last time I go to the deli.  Oakmont deli should do some research and go to some  REAL dell's to see how it's done for real."}
{"text":"I like to eat  at Oakmont Deli once in a while to get a good sandwich.  The deli has a homey, old-fashioned feel to it. There are five tables inside the restaurant where you can eat or you can carry out. My favorite sandwich is corned beef and swiss on marble rye. Today I decided to get the combo:1/2 a sandwich plus a cup of clam chowder. You can make up your own sandwich or get one of the specialty sandwiches; and all sandwiches come with a crunchy pickle. For $2.25 you can can get double meat, but the sandwiches have plenty of meat on them. If you're looking for dessert, Oakmont Deli also sells gelato."}
{"text":"Very nice people. Great deli meats and cheeses and reasonably priced. Good sandwiches and soups also."}
{"text":"When I'm in New York City, I love the delis for sandwiches, but I don't know of too many places like that in Pittsburgh, until I found Oakmont Deli by accident after stopping in Oakmont to visit a clothing store my wife heard about. When we saw the sign that they had hot soup, we thought it would be a fun place to warm up. I was pleasantly surprised by the great food and old school style of this fun deli.
The lunch meat selections are expansive, and are either Boars Head brand, or made in house. They had some cool stuff like sliced ribeye, pulled pork, slabs of meatloaf, and lots of turkey flavors, roast beef pastrami, hams, and other deli standards. They have lots of cheeses, different sliced breads, and many toppings like fresh tomato slices, lettuce, red onions, roasted red peppers, and more. I had a roast beef sandwich on wheat with cheddar cheese, mayo, and lettuce and tomato, and the sandwich was thick, the roast beef was flavorful, and the tomato slices were cut thick. The sandwich was wrapped in white paper with a thick pickle spear (yay pickles!). I paired it with their homemade tomato basil soup, which had big chunks of tomatoes and a tasty sauce like texture. My wife also had roast beef on sour dough bread, and she had French onion soup, which was had a rich beef broth, tasty onions, and thick bread with oozing cheese on top. It was some of the best French onion soup I've had. 
Other sides available included coleslaw, potato salad, pasta salads, and more, plus a selection of chips and snacks, and lots of drinks.
Oakmont Deli also sells lunch meat by the pound, as well as specialty sandwiches with lots of meats, cheeses, and toppings. There's lots of other sides, daily soups, and for dessert, gelato. They even have specialty premium steaks, catering services, and select groceries. 
Oakmont is always a fun place to visit, and now I have a great place to eat when I'm there."}
{"text":"This place does have a real nice hometown local business feel to it. They have a good selection of sandwiches, sides, soups and gelato. They use quality ingredients like good Boar's Head meats and their soups are made fresh.

HOWEVER, I cannot get past their price point. You're looking at 10-12 bucks for a wrap and a side/cup of soup. I know local businesses don't do the volume that larger delis do, but it is hard to support with those prices. It's a shame, I'd go there more often of I couldn't get similar food for much more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"great little shop  oakmont is a really cute little town.. and the food is good"}
{"text":"Food is very good but almost $11 for a bag of chips, soda and sandwich.  I agree with previous posts.  Offer some coupons and I'd visit more.  Nice old fashioned atmosphere.  Really only bad point is an $8 sandwich."}
{"text":"Great deli sandwiches with lots of choices of toppings, meats, and cheeses. The speciality sandwiches are expertly crafted - I really like the Deli Dunker ( essentially a French Dip), lots of meat with a side of au jus. Also the Big Dan and Cajun Rueben have not let me down. 
I've seen many customers come in to get their deli cuts to take home - a great selection of Boars Head meats and cheeses. The menu is not overwhelming - which can be tedious at a deli.  Just all the ingredients for a great sandwich - with a pickle on the side!  
I'm in agreement that Pgh is in need of more quality delis and this is certainly one. The downfall may be the atmosphere - a little dark and tight. Takeout may be the way to go."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, I had the Chuck Butt which is a corned beef on rye with coleslaw!  Excellent!  Lots of flavor, and the slaw was tasty.  They have quite the selection of sandwiches and build your own, also.  Then there's the gelato - wish I had taken some for the road, but not today .

I'd recommend giving this place a try to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"They have good quality Boars Head deli meats. Pretty expensive but worth it. But the service here is terrible. It takes 15 minutes for them to cut 2 pounds of lunch meat. With 2 people waiting on you! Slowest deli counter I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"The Oakmont Deli serves Boar's Head products, as well as a variety of homemade items like soup, gelato, side dishes, and more. The deli itself is small and quiet; and, staff are friendly. My main issue is the price versus portion. I'd like to go here more often; however, the prices aren't much cheaper than Panera and the portions are about the same. They charge for all kinds of extras on sandwiches and certainly don't include anything for free."}
{"text":"There's not a lot of places to find open on a Sunday when you are under time constraints but since we wanted to get something fast my husband and I stopped here for lunch.

Basically it is a grab and go sandwich shop but they do have a few tables for in house dining. The cold cuts are provided by Boar's head. They also serve breakfast sandwiches till about 1. They sell soup and they have a few groceries in the back for purchase. In addition they have specialty sandwiches of the day or you can build your own.

My husband had an Italian sandwich with coleslaw while I settled for an oven roasted turkey on pumpernickle with lettuce and tomato. Drinks are available for purchase in a cooler near the restroom.

They do have styrofoam containers to help you gauge the size of the portion you wish to purchase. We got our food after paying at the register and sat down. It was typical better end grocery food. Between the sandwich and the coleslaw that was enough for a quick bite.

The deli is located across the train tracks directly opposite the Oakmont Bakery. There is a walkway if you are parking on that two way street which will safely get you across the train tracks."}
{"text":"Reminds me somewhat of an Islys where you can stop in a grab a deli sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"J and I came here for lunch today. We really liked the overall decor of the deli, with the antique cash register in the window, photos of Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe, and model planes. We both ordered the \"build your own\" sandwiches. J had maple honey ham and havarti cheese on sourdough bread. I ordered the Cajun turkey with havarti cheese, tomatoes, spring mix, and mayo on sourdough bread. I also ordered wedding soup. Our sandwiches came with a pickle. Everything was very good, which is to be expected as all of the meats are Boar's Head. The staff were very nice and welcoming, which added to the overall experience. Definitely head to this place if you're in the neighborhood looking for lunch!"}
