{"text":"Le Marly is ok.  I did not eat here, I only drank.  They have a signature raspberry martini with Vodka, raspberry puree and a basil leaf, which is good.  Most of the drinks are under $10, for example liquor drinks are about $8.50, 20oz beer about $7.50.  The appetizers ordered by some of the other people in our group looked good, but I did not try them.

While this place is located on Beaver Hall in the middle of downtown, it's unfortunate that it is not very frequented.  Literally no one came in while we were there for almost 3 hours on a Thursday.

They have a very modern decor with a Purple theme.  

The staff was nice, took our coats upon entry with out a fee.  Also were very attentive to our needs (drinks)

Personally, I wouldn't pick this place for an evening out, but if the group was already going, I'd tag along."}
{"text":"Quelle belle suprise. Essayer le midi, pour un diner d'affaire, je dois avouer que j'ai été plus qu'agréablement surpris. Faisant partie du tryptique de Jérome Ferrer, (Andiamo et le Beaver Hall)  Le Marly ofre un menu simple mais efficace. Amateur de  Tartare je n'ai pu résister à leur Tartare de boeuf coupé au coûteau. Bien relevé, il fondait dans la bouche. La crabe cake en entré était aussi excellent de même que le dessert, un petit pot de caramel avec morceau de brownie. J'ai aussi eut la chance de volé une bouché du risotto et j'y retournerais juste pour pouvoir en avoir une assiette complète. Le service était chaleureux, efficace et attentioné."}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend, and some friends and the food was really good, the only thing we missed is the lack of a dish made of cow meat in the menu... all other options were great, but is always good to have the option of choice.."}
