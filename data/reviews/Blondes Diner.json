{"text":"Went over the weekend totally recommend the coconut crepes with a latte! Seems like they have really worked through several of their few initial kinks mentioned in other reviews. 

I thought the food was great, I really like the ambiance, a lot of diners can feel like you are almost sitting on top of each other, I liked the white airy feel of Blondes.

I actually swung by there today to grab a breakfast sandwich to go and a latte, and it was just as delicious as the weekend and faster than starbucks!  

Would highly recommend Blondes, can't wait to try more of their menu items, its a close walk so I will definitely be going back. If they install wifi it would be a great place to sit and work as well. 

If going for the first time I suggest: coconut crepes and a latte, will totally hit the spot.  I actually usually tend to go more savoury and really enjoyed the breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"We tried it today hearing that they had a great breakfast sandwich. That may be but our chicken salad sandwich was dry and bland. The kale salad accompanying it was also incredibly boring. It even looked sad on the plate. There was a lone slice of half a cucumber round. 
Our server was sweet and apologized that our food was taking so long because of my kids pancakes - huh? Two pancakes should be a quick order and when they came out they were cold. They also had parsley on the underside of them. Obviously they were placed where they shouldn't have been, like on a counter with other food items. 
I will say the room is decorated nicely and they have potential but they need to get it together in short order. For a $50 lunch with two kids meals I'd say there are lots of other places to spend your $. Owner/chef pay attention to your reviewers comments or you'll be like all the other previous restaurants in that location - HISTORY."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten here despite my best efforts.

When Blonde's had just opened, my boyfriend and I went in to see if they had anything vegan on the menu, fulling expecting them not to but hoping for the best. The chef yelled across an empty dining room that he would \"make us something but it wouldn't be exciting\". MMkkayy. The owner (manager?) was around and overheard us so he came out to the front of house to give us his e-mail. He asked us for OUR OWN RECIPES so he could \"just put something vegan on the menu\". 

I don't expect every restaurant to accommodate me, but expect a yes or no answer instead of eating a consolation prize or my own cooking. 

Decor looks great though."}
{"text":"The service was so slow I had to just leave and get lunch some where else.
I would not go back as there seems to be no real leadership and there are far better places closes by."}
{"text":"I had a pretty underwhelming breakfast experience here. Actually I think I could have cooked a better breakfast for myself.

I had the mission breakfast - poached eggs, with crispy bacon, potatoes, bread and jam. Pretty much all ingredients lumped on the plate. Nothing special and wouldn't win any awards for presentation or exceptional flavours.

As I was pretty hungry after a long haul flight to Calgary I also ordered the bowl of fruit ($5!! Sweet deal!). Again, this was exactly what I got. A big bowl of fruit. Although I must say the fruit was very fresh and included massive blackberries (yum!), raspberries, grapes, strawberries, and rockmelon. A bit of yoghurt would have gone nicely but wasn't available on the menu. Strange.

Coffee was good. A latte served in a big mug and was just what I needed at the time."}
{"text":"OMG. The HAM. So delicious!!! I'm always torn between the ham eggs Benny or the croque Madame. 

Brunch has been getting boring for me recently - especially with all the beer halls now trying to do brunch (such a waste of time- more on that later). But this place has a great menu - out with the boring eggs Benny. Mushrooms or pulled ham you just can't go wrong. And I love the vibe, can go in super hungover or dressed up ready for mimosas with the girls. It's a really cute and chic restaurant. 

My favourite has to be the eggs that they use - must be farm fresh. 

Oh, and another thing that is absolutely  vital to my Sunday brunch? A coffee cup that's is never empty!!!! I hate when places ignore that - relieved that Blonde's keeps my cup full."}
{"text":"I consider myself a bit of a breakfast diner connoisseur and so I was kind of disappointed in Blondes Diner, also having enjoyed some really great diner experiences in my life. 

Taking into account the fact that they've only been open a week or so, the service was super slow for a Monday afternoon. The servers looked flustered and confused and kept refilling my coffee without asking. 

The menu was disappointing because I had such high hopes from the now famous chef. I got the \"Mission\" breakfast, which is just bacon and eggs, hashbrowns and toast. I asked for medium poached eggs and got hard. They offered me jam and ketchup made in house, but I could swear it was just ketchup and marmalade from Safeway. The quantities they gave me were also unsatisfactory.

All told, the servers meant well and were very personable and the food was tasty enough that I might consider going back since it's so close to where I live and I sometimes get uncontrollable breakfast cravings. 

In my opinion, until they get their act together, it's best to stick with Mission Diner just down 4th street a couple blocks. The food is better, cheaper and the service is the best.

UPDATE: I've been back twice since my first visit and I can honestly say they've stepped up their game. They hired the cute/amazing server from Red's (Danny, I think her name is?) and it seems like the menu has changed. So far I've exclusively ordered the Mission Breakfast because it's cheaper and fills me up and it keeps getting tastier and tastier. I finally got to try their in house apple butter jam and spicy ketchup and it was YUM. So give them a try!"}
{"text":"This building has housed different restaurants over the years. A long time ago a Dutch restaurant was here and then more recently a Turkish one. There are still some parking spaces beside the Mac's which were for the previous restaurant so you don't have to pay for on street parking- which is good because the prices are high in the restaurant. The eggs Benny- which I did not have- is $15. about $3. more than comparable diners. The coffee is $3. I did have the Mission breakfast and was totally underwhelmed. The portions were very skimpy- hardly any hashbrowns, 2 small strips of bacon and watery poched eggs. The toast was good but only one slice. No fruit of any kind on the plate and no jam offered for the toast. The homemade ketchup tastes more like a pizza sauce. In fact one of the other cutomers asked for and received good old Heinz 57. For the price I paid here for a very ordinary breakfast I could have had the really good eggs Benny and delicious hashbrowns at Holy Grill."}
{"text":"Going in, I knew that the place was the brain child of Top Chef Canada funny guy, Chris Shaften and for that reason I was really excited to try it.

The food was good, but nothing stood out to the point where my mind was blown.  Cafe Rosso coffee flowed bountifully and was excellent.

The dinning area is hip as f**k and the patio was lovely for a late morning brunch. The service was fantastic. So A+ for ambiance.

All in all, this brunch didn't knock my socks off in terms of flavour but it has a lot of great things going on for it."}
{"text":"I was at Blondes during their first week and had a really poor experience. we waited over an hour after ordering for food to arrive. The three others I was with weren't able to get the hashbrowns they ordered because of the ridiculous process it takes to get them from the freezer to the table. They were given only one choice of substitution that didn't come close to what they ordered and then the replacement sides showed up on the bill!
While I would normally be more understanding during a business' first week but the way management handled the whole thing was unacceptable. There was no explanation or apology for the lateness of our food, no offer was made to make up for the food that wasn't available, and we had to contest the sides that no one had wanted in the first place.
The food was good enough but not as impressive as one expects with a Top Chef contestant in the kitchen. The decor is simple but nice and much brighter than it looked in any of it's former states.

This is the only time I've left brunch feeling hungry. I will give them another try but I was unimpressed with my first visit. With the stiff brunch competition on 4th Stree, Blondes will have to step up their game or close their doors."}
