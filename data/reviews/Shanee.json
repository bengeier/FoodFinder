{"text":"so soo good. literally everything we ordered was delicious. highly recommend the salmon ceviche and fried fish!"}
{"text":"I should start by saying two things. First, I typically don't bother with reviews unless I had an amazing experience or a terrible experience. I eat out for practically every meal (lunch and dinner), so try a LOT of restaurants that Toronto has to offer.   Second, I REALLY wanted to like this place. It is just down the street from my office and also close to my home. It seemed to have a lot of promise (despite every restaurant that has been there for the last 10 years not ever succeeding) and people seemed to like the food based on the reviews here.   Anyways, onto the review. I went there with my girlfriend tonight and have to say that I wasn't impressed by anything. I told her I was going to write a review and give it a 2 star, however she asked me what about it made it worth the second star and I have to sadly say nothing did... so 1 star it is.   Luckily I wasn't very hungry because as every other review on here states... you don't get much for what you pay for. I'm not a price driven consumer, I'll pay whatever if it tastes amazing, but sadly it doesn't and the ingredients just don't match up to the price.   I'd say that maybe we just unfortunately chose bad dishes, but the menu is TINY (which usually screams that they do a few things AMAZINGLY well, however that wasn't the case), so unfortunately it's just not great.   We had the Lui Suan... they are overloaded with lettuce, with literally 3-5 small sheds of carrot and 1 shrimp per half that is so small and thin it was literally see-through... like i could see the abundance of lettuce on the other side of the shrimp, through the shrimp. The mint/cilantro dipping sauce, just didn't do it for me either. GF also wasn't impressed... we left 1 of the 4 halves on the table.   Had the Khai-Jiaw Grob and the K.Krata SongKrun (names on the receipt, shortened from the menu), whichever was the deep fried egg... was just a deep fried egg, didn't taste like much (till we put the included hot sauce on it, which didn't help much) and sort of tasted like the oil in the deep fryer could use a change. All in all, a deep fried egg that wasn't at all special. The other dish, two eggs with the spicy pork on top... actually wasn't that bad when put over the sticky rice (which is another story in and of itself, because the rice wasn't done very well), but our problem is that the egg whites weren't fully cooked so it was a little slimy and not very appetizing. Again, not a stand out dish.   The Singha beer was fantastic as it always is, but they have nothing to do with that. Our server, nice dude from Spain, was just fine. Some people complained about the service, but we found our server to be incredibly pleasant and the food to come out TOO fast, if anything. I typically like a dining experience to last 45 minutes + at the very least, but we were in and out within 35.   All in all, we left some of every dish on the plate (pretty much the entire deep fried egg, because it REALLY was not our speed) and those plates are small and a little overpriced based on the cost of ingredients they used.   Soi... I wish I could say my $60, 35 minute meal was a great one and I sincerely wanted you to do well, but I'll never come back."}
{"text":"Excellent street style Thai food. Small plates, great for sharing. Everything we ordered was flavourful. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food as I haven't tried it, but I always love a spot that serves coffee with cocktails. Combined with the decor and the music, it's a vibe."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai street food served with love. The service may still be a bit patchy (I'd love to get my drinks before the food started coming out), but the overall experience is delightful, and the owner's passion for her business is infectious. Best: Stir Fried Morning Glory (it's her Mom's recipe, and Mom is the one cooking in the back), Pork Skewers, and the house made Coconut Ice Cream (which is more like an ice, really, as it is non dairy.)  An added bonus is all the bits and pieces that the owners brought over from Thailand to make it really feel like home - things like the woven containers for the sticky rice. And there are many family photos hidden in the wall mural.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it is a little pricey compared to the street carts in Thailand, but it's worth it. Dinner for two including a bottle of wine was $90-ish and that included about five dishes and two orders of rice. We left happy and sated. And determined to come back!"}
{"text":"Super tasty tapas style Thai.  Really enjoyed the variety, everything was fresh and expertly done."}
{"text":"Food quality is very average and portion sizes are small. It is definitely overpriced for what you get. I ordered a lunch special and it was only a few small pieces of stringy chicken and then a large amount of plain rice."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated place that really gives the Thai street food feel. Thankfully it is much more spacious and comfortable than the similarly themed Nana.  Lots of unique Thai dishes that are hard-to-find in Toronto. I particularly enjoyed the khai-jiaw grob. My only qualm is that there was no tiered pricing and the prices were a bit on the expensive side given the tapas portion size. All the main tapas dishes were $10 and the sides were $3.50. One would expect each dish to be priced according to the ingredients or size."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out for a while with a certain amount of excitement. The decor was fantastic, and the service even better. The server was honest about the number of items to order to satisfy two people, which I appreciated.   The food itself was fantastic, but we both left hungry, and for the price you really can't be leaving a restaurant hungry.  I do with them well... Sounds like it's a family affair. Maybe they can bump up the portions a little ;)"}
{"text":"The other day I went with my girlfriend to try this new Thai place in Little Italy. When we entered in the server came to us right away and nicely let us choose a table to seat in as the resto was almost empty at that time. He gave us the menus right away and explained to us the concept of the food and that it was tapas style, also pointed us the favorite costumer dishes, the special of the day and he said to give us a couple of minutes to take a look to the menu and that we could tell him if we would have any questions Everything was going perfect, really chill and relax.Until the chef came over and started stressing us out with questions and suggestions we didn't ask for...she was insisting too much on us getting some specific items from the menu which we just didn't feel like having, after rejecting her suggestion, she kept insisting even more just with the reason \"it is so good\". Honestly, we felt so harass by her the whole time. When you go out to eat, you want to think about what you are gonna eat first, also there is some food you dislike or you just don't feel like eating it that day. I'm sure the chicken was good, but we just didn't want chicken. If you have a menu, you have let the people choose to eat whatever they want to eat from it. We had the impression she didn't wanted to get to cook any complicated dishes and she wanted to cook the only the easy ones... We almost ended up having a order written that we didn't want at all because her persistence, but thanks God we got out of the embarrassing situation and have a couple of minutes for ourselves, when were ready to order, the server noticed it and came right away to our table being a good listener and taking our order right away, the rest of the service during the dinner was impeccable, he took care that everything was ok, kept serving us water without us asking him and removing dirty dishes to let us space on the table. We also loved the music he was playing creating a really cool ambience. The place it's really cool too, specially the collage on the wall and the cute plastic stool.  And the food was great! Really tasty and fresh and really different from other Thai restaurant in the city. Maybe a bit pricey for the the size of the plates, even the plates are meant to share, portions should be bigger.  We would definitely come back but if the chef stay in the kitchen and let the servers do their job properly. During the dinner we saw how she kept doing the same to other costumers and we were all agree that it is something you can't do to costumers here.I Everybody was feeling so uncomfortable about this. We don't want to be stress out on a restaurant,that's for sure."}
{"text":"Nice little place on College St. It reminds me a bit of Thailand the moment I stepped inside with the cool decor, but when the food came out .. I was a bit disappointed with the quality and nothing special about the meal that I ordered. The egg was overcooked and bit oily, the rice was dried, the spicy minced pork was okay and the server did his best job to make the meal awesome.  The price seems a bit high for the quality of the foods. I don't mind paying the extra buck for a good meal but when you receive a mediocre meal with small portion with a price that you expect the food to be better but it's not...I may be back sometime to try other dishes hopefully it will be better next time!"}
{"text":"Just like Tom a few comments before, I really wanted to like this place.   Nice quaint spot, however The food was really mediochre at best, tiny portions for 10$. Didn't taste all that fresh - and when I'm having salmon seviche (is that really bankok street food?) it must be fresh.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai milk tea popsicles at the taste of Italy festival today! Eat them fast because they melt quick in today's heat"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, really flavourful food - what 're people on about portion size? Totally reasonable. Best of all, great service in giving recommendations and making us feel totally cared for when one dish was not to our liking. Would return!"}
{"text":"I agree with previous reviewers. The portions are quite small for the price. The Dallman ceviche was the one dish that really stood out to me. I would skip the fried pork balls , they tasted sour and were a bit on the dried side. The coconut ice cream and ice tea with milk are nice as well. Service was great and attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance! Excellent service! Excellent food - we had tapas style everything - pork skewers, lightly battered garlic sweet and sour fish, shrimp rolls, a ground beef/egg dish, sticky and jasmine rice (sorry, I don't know the Thai names). Will go back again! :) it's perfect for a date and for a big group!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place as I often do new restaurants that pop up in my area.   We went in a little late and they appeared to be closing. We apologized and started to leave, but they welcomed us in. We were treated with such warmth and friendliness, and it was an absolute pleasure to be there. They even brought out iced teas for free for us to try, and they were delicious. The decor is also quite pleasant and I enjoyed the ambiance. They really put some thought into making it look like a side-street food vendor while remaining classy.  We ordered the crispy fried egg, some greens in a delicious sauce and the shrimp ceviche. They were all interesting textures and flavours I hadn't tasted before, which was a plus. No one really cared for the crispy egg as it just basically tasted like dry crispy deep-fryer leftover bits, but the greens and ceviche were delicious.  The only contention I have with this place is the price. Each dish is $10 for the tiniest little plate. I understand that it's in a sort of prime location and maybe rent is a lot, but I've paid marginally more for heaps of great quality food in decent locations. After tax and tip it was $48 for the 3 of us (it would have been $66 if we'd bought the ice teas). That's a good price if you're full after, but we left pretty hungry. To fill up, you're probably looking at about $35 per person after tax and tip."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food, friendly staff  and accommodating for kids. Also lots of vegetarian options. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food with excellent service! The food is very flavourful! Even though it's quite small inside, the interior is designed beautifully.   One of the best Thai restaurants I've tried in toronto.   Definitely will be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"This is a gem.  Food is interesting, super tasty and so different from the boring Thai that you find in every Toronto street and food court.  We were a group of 3 and tried about 12 dishes and left very satisfied.  If you are looking for cheap this isn't the place for you.  If you love food and flavour definately worth the night out."}
{"text":"Not your typical Thai joint in that there is no pad thai noodles or curry... but don't fret - change is never a bad thing.  Instead you get good quality street-style food with absolutely delicious sauces (the chef uses her mom's recipes from back home).  So pull up a plastics chair (typical seating in the streets of Bangkok) order a singha and enjoy. The meal begins with complimentary shrimp chips with a spicy sauce - yum!  My menu picks are the morning glory on rice which comes with a fried egg, the spicy fish and and the pork skewers.  If your into Thai iced tea (aka cha yen) I suggest getting it in the form of a popicle.  The rice powder on the salmon ceviche was definitely unique but not a texture that I ended up enjoying too much.  Warning : the items at the front of the cash area are not for sale but are only for display - bummer!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful spot. Chef Nopawan is very passionate about her food, be it a thai classic or something she's experimenting with. Despite having a broken arm she made sure to spend time greeting us at the table, asking us about the food and what brought us in.   The food itself was all around great, and the owner even offered to accommodate each diner's tastes- like your som tam a less sweet and more on the tart side? No problem! The only minor quibble is the price of each item, as if you show up on an empty stomach, expect to leave with a lighter wallet. Most items are $10 and probably better suited to $8. Most $8 items better suited to $6."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai Street food location in ALL of Toronto. The prices are bomb, very inexpensive and the portions excellent. These guys know flavour - those red chilli's are wonderful! My favourite dish was definitely the Duck Wings. Friendly staff and quick service, on a nice street. Cocktails are unique with a Thai flare. Would recommend for any event, casual date or a cozy night with flavourful food."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago for a friend's birthday party and was very pleased with the food.  Ambiance: 5/5   I really love their decor. It's incredibly unique, has a cool vibe, and the pictures of the owners' family/daughter brought an incredibly authentic vibe to the modern fixings. If you've ever been to Thailand it reminded me of one of those cool hip restaurants in Pai or Chiang Mai.   Food: 4/5   We tried a few appetizers, some curries, soaps, fried fish  and cocktails, everything was really delicious and tasted fresh. The spice level is just right.   Value: 4/5   Thai food has really spiked in popularity in recent years and as such, places like Pai/Khao San charge somewhat of a premium (IMO) of 15-18$ a dish; this food was comparable in terms of taste and i would even say the portions were larger in some instances with dishes priced an average of $11. Great value.   Service: 5/5   Our waitress was very patient with our indecisive group. Checked on us frequently to make sure our waters and food was to our liking."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I read about Soi Thai opening, and had high hopes for it. I'm from Thailand, so I know Thai food well and am happy to see it catching on the way it is here. It's unfortunate that Soi Thai turned out to be such a disappointment.   The food at Soi Thai was okay, but incredibly overpriced. Keep in mind that I am a tiny girl... but even so, after my boyfriend and I spent $60 on four plates and two beers, I was still starving. We ended up going somewhere else for a proper dinner afterwards. (I know they say it is Thai-style Tapas, but the portions were way too tiny, considering they charged $8-10 for each plate. I wouldn't call these \"sharing plates\", as they call them. Each plate was barely enough for one person, let alone two!) The som tam (papaya salad) was extremely bland and contained very little actual papaya that evening. The moo ping was very tasty, and the only thing I thought was worth ordering. The salmon lui suan came with a nice sauce, but definitely not worth what they were charging. The side order of sticky rice was also incredibly tiny. It's rice... you're charging $3.50. I think it's okay if you give us a little more than just a tiny ball of it. When they brought the chicken wings out, I thought they were playing a terrible joke on us. They took the middle section of the (already emaciated) wing and separated it to make two pieces. Who does that?!?! I understand they are trying to cut costs, but that is just ridiculous. When was the last time the owners of Soi Thai paid $60 for street food (and left starving)? Probably never. I wish I hadn't either. There are other, better Thai restaurants in Toronto. I gave it a try, but I am never going to Soi Thai again."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber Eats. The delivery time was accurate and the driver polite. Not so keen on the food. I had the Lui Suan, fresh shrimp rolls. The sauce was excellent, sweet and spicy. There were two rolls, both cut into half. One half of each roll had a shrimp in it. So two bland shrimp for $6. Not the best. Then the Tom Yua Pla Tod, a lemongrass and kaffir lime soup. Let me say that the flavour was excellent, but the hard bits of lemongrass were big chunks that I had to keep picking out. My biggest issue with this soup, and I realize this is my issue, is that the battered fish was weirdly stringy with that black underside of skin. I couldn't cut the fish chunks without a knife and ended up not eating most of it. Drank the broth though.  And the biggest disappointment was the Soy Tod Kua Prik Kratiam dinner. The fried soy meat was in dried chunks. The jasmine rice was flavourless (eg I could have made it at home) and the small side of slaw was okay without a lot of dressing. So a very dry meal. Literally rice and spicy chunks that needed to be chewed and chewed. It cost $38 (includes a $5 delivery, but does not include tip for driver to $43) for a meal that I am not even going to finish. Will be throwing a lot of it out.  Sad."}
{"text":"A new Thai street food restaurant in Little Italy. The interior tries to imitate the 'Soi' (Thai for side street) vibe and does an excellent job. I found it to be similar to Nana in decor but much more welcoming due to the openness and natural light. The staff was also very friendly.   We started off with Thai iced tea and received complimentary shrimp chips. The Thai iced tea was good and it wasn't too sweet but the quantity was lacking for the price ($4.50), much smaller than KSR or Pai. All their dishes are sharing style and cost $10, while sides such as steamed/sticky rice are $3.50.  We had the crispy omelette, fried chicken wings, papaya salad and shrimp ceviche salad. The crispy omelette is egg fried in hot oil to achieve the crunchiness and topped with scallions and a side of hot sauce. While it was something new, the consensus was that it was really just egg. The fried chicken wings were lightly seasoned and unbattered, served with strands of deep fried lemongrass. The thai papaya salad was fairly standard, bright with sourness and a kick of heat. The shrimp ceviche salad was a few shrimp marinated in a spice blend laid over a slaw. Calling this a ceviche was misleading, as it appeared the shrimp were already cooked and then marinated. Overall, the food quality was decent but there were no standouts.  Now my main issue with this place....price. While they are trying to go for a sharing concept with the small plates, the high pricing seems contradictory to the concept of street food. Even comparing to other tapas-style places like Guu or Sabai Sabai, the price was quite high. The pricing was also inconsistent - portion size was similar for all the dishes regardless of their contents ($10 should not be the same quantity of papaya salad and chicken wings). I think if they use tiered pricing and reduced prices to around $6-$8, this could be a winner. But the way it is, go in a with a big wallet or expect to leave the way we did...hungry."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like this place :( it's just way too overpriced for what you get. I had an omelette thing which was mostly airy bits of egg, and a plate of morning glory. The menu is small and they call everything a \"snack\" but they're all $10 each. Also had the iced tea and did not enjoy it. It came out to over $50 for two people and I left hungry."}
{"text":"Ventured to this restaurant over the weekend. The service was great but the food was amazing!!! Really good quality thai food. They serve dishes that are authentic and not commercialized! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love the food here, it's delicious and authentic Thai street food. The service is also so friendly every time. The decor inside is also colorful and lovely. Definitely my new go-to Thai!"}
{"text":"Very atmospheric. Slightly overpriced for the serving size you get but the food is delicious. Menu isn't very descriptive and they use tangy fish sauce in basically everything - so ask if you're opposed/allergic to that."}
{"text":"I've never been to Bangkok... so I'm not going to say how authentic or not the food is.. instead I'll just tell you my overall experience and how the food taste, based on my picky tastebuds :)  Situated in the westend, I walked in shortly after 6, with a few tables already occupied.. with FAMILIES! What a surprise to see little tots in the west end... definitely brings smiles to my face because a family friendly restaurant always means that service is usually friendly and accommodating.  The interior is bright and colourful, while nothing is over pretnetious. The chairs / stools are plastic like the ones you can get for super cheap, or sit in a street food joint. The light fixtures are upside down baskets that light up the room, and the front is a large window that opens up, letting the nice breeze come in. The first thin you will notice in the back is the giant array of treats and snacks - my eye went straight to the POCKY - bangkok style... it's not for sale, but definitely will make your moth water.  .. ok the food the food. We ordered rice wraps which had NO noodles in it - so refreshing I might add, with lettuce, carrots and a piece of shrimp. The basil mint sauce really created a punch to each bite.. and might I add.. it was very garlicky. Next we got the skillet with two eggs, and ground pork.. reminded me of bimbipap without the rice.. which was fine by me... once again, loaded with flavour and the little chillies gave some serious kick. The garlic shrimp, a new item to the menu... was justtt that... full of garlic - no joke, but different from the sauce with garlic... also very peppery but in a good way. The one thing that I had high hopes for, but was not really happy with was the Salmon Ceviche - the one with the toasted rice powder. It was really gritty and the salmon pieces were rather large - I was hoping for  a bit more liquid and there were too many chili bits leaving every bite feeling uncomfortably hot.  Overall the meal was pretty good. The dishes were  a tad small for the $10 price tag per plate.   I would say, however, to get the Thai Ice Tea (without the milk)... it is delicious, and every sip tasted like grass jelly. YUM!"}
{"text":"What a great place.   My daughter and I went for lunch during week last week.   Delicious fried cheese , lumpia and curry puffs.   Tom Yum soup was just the right amount of spiciness.  And the service was great too.  Katherine - thank you!"}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly here and eager to help, but the food is mediocre and definitely way too overpriced for the portions and quality of food."}
{"text":"This is the worst Thai food I have ever had in GTA. DO NOT COME HERE!!! When I ate here the name, the name was \"Soi\" I don't know why they changed the name...   I came here because I saw the decoration looks cool, kinda like Pai, has the Bangkok street and night market vibe. And the menu looked not bad.    So let's talk about the food.  It taste like the only ingredients in it is SALT... It has no other taste than salt. I mean, come on, it is hard to mess up with Thai food...   Maybe the cook was in bad mood that day? I am not coming back to this restaurant and will not recommend to others."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I just recently discovered this fantastic place. The space is beautiful, great service, and food is amazing. I visited the restaurant during one of their cooking workshop events which they host once a month. Sherry the owner was such a great instructor and learnt so much. They demonstrated how to make Chicken Khao So (Chicken curry with flat noodles) then we made Tub Tim Grob (water chestnut with jackfruit and coconut jelly) for dessert. Both dishes were presented so beautifully and tasted amazing. Cannot wait to be back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I order takeout from Soi a couple times a month and it is consistently delicious.   The garlicky morning glory greens are potentially the best item on the menu.   The yum gai zaap - little chicken bites fried and tossed in toasted rice powder and mint - is addictive. It's like popcorn chicken on steroids. I also love the pla tod nam pla, fried fish with a tangy and spicy sauce.   Service is always warm and they can usually have takeout orders ready within 15/20 mins."}
{"text":"Really great food, good price, good beer/drink selection!  Cool decor and ambience as well and very friendly staff.  Also, they have Wifi!"}
{"text":"Legitimately the only cafe with actual good food. Awesome restaurant for dinner-- so happy this opened in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"A new favourite Thai restaurant for me! I'm a very picky eater when it comes to Thai food but this place does it perfectly! We ordered the salmon ceviche flavoured perfectly! The som tam was a little too sweet for me but the BF loved it!! Portion sizes are definitely tapas style but the food itself was amazing!"}
{"text":"Loved my lunch today. Very fresh tasting and without the bottled goop too many places use. Chilli heat sings but doesn't overwhelm.   Don't come expecting Pad Thai or other things from other Thai restaurants. The menu here reflects what you'd see served by Bangkok street vendors.  Fast, tasty, and very satisfying."}
{"text":"They changed their name from Soi, i have never tried Soi before but i heard good things about it. Decided to try their renovated version. We had the shrimp tom yum, the battered fried fish, duck fresh rolls and Singapore noodles.  Firstly, lightings are kinda odd, make the space looks very old and sketchy.  I wanted to order the lacorn for my drinks - they dont have it  I wanted the grilled pork - they dont have it  My cocktail was good but not too special - the passionfruit cocktails  Tomyum as an entree came in ridiculously small portion.with slaws and white rice. The portion is smaller then other thais place's appetizer version. Taste is great but i had better tom yum Battered fried fish, well seasoned, batter can get greasy. But cant complain because its fried  Singapore noodle is high light. Appetizer portion is fair. $7 is quite worth it.  Peking Duck rolls also the best. But the server was not really knowledgeable about the food when we asked about the sauce came with it. It's fine maybe they are in training.  Down star is they brought us sharing dish and one of it had leftover food on it.   Overall, thai restaurants are everywhere in toronto and there are so many good ones. Definitely will choose the others over this."}
{"text":"Had the lunch here Moo krapao kai doa which is spicy minced pork, with rice topped with crispy fried egg and salad. Food tasted amazing and service was friendly. Comfort food indeed."}
