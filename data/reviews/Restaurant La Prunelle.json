{"text":"Great service, wonderful selection and presentation. Went with the Menu Dégustation option beef tartare, duck breast, and creme brûlée."}
{"text":"J'accuse,  #mtlatable \"on diminue les portions\"   Le principe de Montreal à Table est de faire découvrir les nouveaux restaurants par des prix attractifs et de permettre aux gens ayant moins de budget de pouvoir faire le restaurant de leur choix à un prix abordable. Il ne s'agit surtout pas de diminuer les prix parce qu'on diminue les portions. c'était bon mais pas très copieux. #mtlatable #jaccuse."}
{"text":"Good food but the waitress asked me for more tip after her bad service!  Je suis allee labas hier soir (10 Oct) avec trois autres amis, la bouffe n'etait pas mal du tout sauf que j'ai trouve du cheveux dans mon entree (a l'escargot), je ne voulais pas faire la difficile alors je n'ai rien dit (j'etais serveuse avant...) Le service n'etait pas top du tout,  elle a pris la commande pour 2 de mes amis et est partie sans demander ce que moi ou mon copain on voulait alors qu'on etait pret, on a du l'appeler de prendre notre commande avec (chose qui devrait etre naturelle...)  Bref, la bouffe etait bonne mais service mediocre, j'ai mis 5% de tip, et la serveuse me l'a pointe (franchement, pensait-elle qu'elle merite plus? je n'ai rien ajouté!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner with a friend here last night! The grilled octopus was delicious, as was the goat cheese salad. My friend ordered the salad as well, along with the beef tartar. We were both very pleased! For desert she enjoyed the crème brûlée and I had the butternut squash cake with salted caramel and chai tea, mascarpone and clementines. I am still thinking about how amazing it was this morning.   Apart from the food, BYOW was a plus and the service was great. We will be back soon to try a few other things that caught our eyes on the menu! (And for that cake of course)"}
{"text":"My overall experience from La Prunelle was rather deceiving. Perhaps my hopes and expectations were too high. However, for the same price (or even less), there are plenty of other restaurants in town that can offer you that higher gastronomic level I am talking about.

{"text":"Another excellent Rue Duluth restaurant.  On the night we were there, they seemed a little understaffed, but the wait staff were working hard and were well trained. Mushroom appetizer was excellent, as was guinea hen/mushroom entree special.  All in all a great experience.  Pro tip: the depanneur down the block has a few decent bottles of red wine. (This is BYO.)"}
{"text":"J'ai mangé à La Prunelle lors d'un mariage. La nourriture était succulente. Par contre, le café était le café le plus fade que j'ai eu la «chance» de boire dans un restaurant. Outre cela, le prix est quand même dispendieux. J'ai quand même passé une belle soirée, vu son aspect festif! :)"}
{"text":"Nourriture est correcte, sans plus. MAUVAIS service, refuse de changer de table après notre demande parce que nous ne voulions pas être à côté de l'entrée... Alors que d'autres tables sont disponibles. À peine un merci en reçevant le 140$ sur une addition de 114$...  Ne suggère pas dutout!  Benjamin"}
{"text":"Super dîner entre amis. Service agréable et à l'écoute. Les plats étaient délicieux, originaux et avaient un vrai travail de création, Je recommande fortement mais reservez avant le resto est souvent occupé."}
{"text":"A local favourite BYOB (Beer & Wine). The restaurant served a very nice French meal. The service was a bit slow. The food was excellently prepared."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré! Certes le prix est un peu plus élevé que la moyenne mais la qualité et la quantité dans plats valent vraiment le cout. L'ambiance y est chaleureuse quoiqu'un peu bruyante lorsqu'il y a des grandes tablées.  Service un peu long. Apportez votre vin.  Super adresse, je la recommande à tout le monde les yeux fermés."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Service slow at time (let's say paced) BYOB. Great.  Beer at a BYOB hmmm, not so great.  Tables don't turn over with the regular pace of a non-BYOB.   Food was good  Portions small to medium at best.   Good atmosphere especially if the weather is good.  On the corner with roll up doors to let the air in, great as long as someone on the street isn't smoking."}
{"text":"Resto français, très bon, un peu dispendieux Vous y trouverez des plats typiques et vraiment raffinés Beaucoup de choix de vins également Service très soigné, ambiance calme, presque apaisante; pas trop de monde ni de bruit Il y a parfois des groupons qui valent le coup Essayez le!"}
{"text":"The place had such delicious tartare it was unbelievable! We found La Prunelle randomly walking around and were so happy to land our dinner in this nice restaurant. BYOB was not very common to us coming from the US, but the waitress recommended a SAQ store at the corner where we chose the wine to our liking. We had a steak tartare and a duck tartare which was on a specials board for an appetizer and shared rabbit gnuddi for main course with a creme brûlée for dessert. Everything was amazing! It was the best meal we've had in Montreal.   I can recommend La Prunelle for a romantic date or a group dinner - we saw large groups popping in with lots of wine brought with them. Our waitress was very nice and was very helpful with the menu. The only thing I would change is adding more music to the place. When we arrived the place was very quiet and only at about 9 pm they put on some music which made the atmosphere even better."}
{"text":"Je sais que beaucoup diront que ce restaurant est génial, super, exceptionnel et beaucoup d'autres superlatifs encore. D'ailleurs, j'avoue volontiers qu'il a en effet beaucoup de choses pour lui : les mets y sont raffinés, originaux et savoureux. On y sent une véritable recherche de la part du chef et c'est très agréable pour les papilles. Le décor est cosy et chic, ce qui est idéal pour une soirée en amoureux. Et pourtant... La soirée que nous y avons passée ne nous a pas laissé un souvenir impérissable. Nous étions placés dans un couloir de vent, en plein dans le passage des serveuses et tellement collés à la table d'à côté que chaque fois que le monsieur se levait, il bousculait notre table... Le service était moyen, la note élevée et cerise sur le gâteau, nous n'avions pas noté que le restaurant est un « Apportez votre vin » et nous sommes retrouvés sans vin pour accompagner nos plats!  Ce qui vu leur qualité, était vraiment dommage. Pour les moins fainéants que nous, poussez au moins jusqu'à la SAQ de St-Denis pour prendre de quoi arroser tout ça, et vous détendre un peu. Ça vous aidera à digérer la douloureuse!"}
{"text":"A good higher-end bring your own wine restaurant on Duluth. This is a great French restaurant with excellent table d'hotes. As far as bring your own wine goes, this is definitely one of the better ones in the city, although it also comes with a comparatively higher price. I had the rabbit as a main course and it was great, also their creme brule is amazing!"}
{"text":"Employées très sympathique mais  je pense que le patron devrait engagé une personne supplémentaire afin d'améliorer le service, le magret de canard été froid, ce qui a été une expérience désagréable pour le prix"}
{"text":"The prices are mid/upper level Byow, but the food isn't worth the prices. There are my much better options if you're looking to spend 80$ for 2 in the plateau.   I've been about 5 times because I have a friend who likes this restaurant. But I would never choose it on my own.   The service is plain weird. There is an older lady who appears to run things. And the waitresses follow her lead. I'm finding difficult to explain why it's weird. But I just don't like it. By the end of the night they are always more preoccupied with counting their receipts than servicing their clients."}
{"text":"A very nice bring your own wine restaurant. When I first moved to Montreal this restaurant became a regular spot for my girlfriend and I. In July of 2015 I actually proposed to my girlfriend at La Prunelle. It went over very smooth with the help of that waiters and waitresses! I can say that I have always enjoyed my meals at La Prunelle and I always get the full course meal. My favourite thing to order (if its on the menu) is the Jarret D'agneau!  This place is a must try at least once if you are a big fan of french food."}
{"text":"Went to this great BYOB restaurant last Saturday. Called pretty late and they managed to squeeze our table of 4 in despite it being packed. At first, we started out with the octopus entree with boiled potatoes and squid ink with jalapeño peppers. I didn't like this dish as I found the taste of the boiled potatoes too strong and didn't find the flavors meshed well. I was worried that this was another kind of bad but looks pretty BYOB. But thankfully, the main meal was INCREDIBLE. We had the T-Bone Veal with potatoes, mushrooms, brussel sprouts and a cheddar sauce. This must've been one of the best meals I've had. It was cooked to perfection. 3 of us had it and we all loved it. Great ambiance too. They don't try to rush you out either. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was at Prunelle last night for a friend's birthday and had a lovely experience. We felt the food was delicious and about what we were expecting to pay - under $50 per person for 2 or 3 courses each, not including the wine we brought ourselves. Everyone yummed a lot, from the spicy steak tartar, to the mushrooms with truffle oil, to the magret de canard, to the bison ribs with polenta fries, roast rabbit, all the way through to the perfect crème brûlée that arrived with a surprise sparkler for our birthday girl.   We had no service issues. Sunday in early, snowy March we had the place almost to ourselves. Nobody rushed us and we felt well taken care of in this chill, chic joint by the Duluth cobblestones."}
{"text":"As part of some festivities a few weeks ago, a large group of us ended up at La Prunelle for dinner before going out. It was a large group of us (around 15 folks), but we had called in advance for a reservation and arrived right on time...so it was a bit of a surprise for us to end up standing around for 20 minutes waiting not only for the previous party (which was smaller) to finish their meal, but then for everything to get cleaned and properly put together for a large group. If anything, it's symbolic of why La Prunelle only gets a tad above one star - the service was poor, to describe it charitably. Perhaps it's because we were ugly Americans north of the border, but it definitely felt like we were being put up with than being served. The impressions certainly did not improve when we were told they were short on menus(!), so we had to share some...including some French-only(!!) versions. I pretty much had to interpret the menu based off the menu on their website that had some (but not all) of the dishes with English subtitles.  After a lengthy wait to finally place our order (another note: we had to wait way too long in between courses), we finally got our hands on some food to eat, which, for a large group, came off of a set menu. I went with the mushrooms with truffle oil to start; these were really good - cooked through just enough so they weren't soggy, and marinated with a richly truffle-infused sauce that really enhanced the earthy flavors of the mushrooms. I split a foie gras appetizer with a few others, and while it was solid, I've had better foie elsewhere. I went with the braised beef shoulder for the entree, and the preparation was great - not overly heavy despite the cut of meat, and very succulent and with a rich marinade making for a delicious bite of meat. The dash of thick pumpkin puree, though, was a misfire, with the flavor just not complementing the beef very well on its own. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate tart...which I never got. I'm not kidding; we had paid for dinner when the entrees come out, but they brought out dessert for only half of the table, and since we had to pick up and go, we didn't stick around to wait for the rest to eventually make its way to us. I had a bite of someone else's as I was standing up to go - decent flavoring, but a bit too light for my preferences.  On sheer service alone, this was one of the worst experiences I've had recently. I had definitely anticipated better, and I would only recommend coming here if you are with a small group of people and are planning to have a meal at a VERY relaxed pace. The food is alright for sure, but it's not something that I would take the chance of enduring the kind of service that was provided here again. Very surprising that on a Saturday night (ostensibly one of the more popular nights for folks to go out and eat), we had such a difficult and trying experience."}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful place, tasty food, and great service by French Boys. This is such a romantic place - my wife is in love with this place.   We will definitely go back. Great for vegetarians too.  Find out the meaning for \"La Prunelle\". It is really beautiful :))"}
{"text":"This popular bring your own wine restaurant is located in the Plateau area amongst many other BYOWs. We had high expectations for this place given it's long standing reputation.  The decor was welcoming and I can understand the appeal as their windows open up completely and allow for a more 'patio experience' for a summer meal.  However food was mediocre by the most. We had the octopus as an entree - a bit dry - and the bison tartar - was well seasoned and probably the best dish of the evening.  For mains I ordered the feta gnuddis - gnuddis are traditionnally made with ricotta... and for a reason... the dish was SO salty that I couldn't even finish it (and for those who know me... I almost never leave food on the plate). My boyfriend ordered the rack of lamb - the lamb itself was well cooked and served with a complimenting sauce, however you can't really call it a rack of lamb if there are only two small pieces ...  Thankfully the bread was very tasty and served warm, which helped to fill us out in the end.   Would I return? Nope! So much better BYOWs out there especially in that price range."}
{"text":"Bon, disons que ce ne fut pas un succès. Nous étions un groupe de 8 personnes avec une réservation pour 21 h. Déjà que c'était plutôt tard (ils fonctionnent par service), nous avons été assis à 21 h 30... Le temps de prendre nos commandes, il était près de 22 h 30. Le service était EXTRÊMEMENT lent. Et ce n'était pas que les cuisines. Nous avons attendu 20 minutes après nos plats principaux pour recevoir le menu des desserts, alors qu'ils étaient trois serveurs pour un petit restaurant. La nourriture en tant que telle était bonne, sans plus, pour moi (j'ai pris le magret de canard avec les pommes de terre fumées, qui étaient... un peu trop fumées). Par contre, mon conjoint a pris la dorade et elle était excellente (tout le plat). Une autre convive a pris du veau, qui était trop cuit et donc très difficile à couper/manger. Une quatrième convive a également pris le veau, mais qui celui-ci était parfaitement cuit. C'est donc dire que la constance de leurs plats n'est pas au point. Bref, avec tout ça, même en demandant de nous apporter les factures avec le dessert, nous avons quitté le restaurant à 0 h 45 (!!). Pour résumer, la nourriture était bonne, mais trop chère pour ce qu'elle était, le service était sympathique, mais TRÈS TRÈS lent (TRÈS lent). Je ne comprends vraiment pas pourquoi ils imposent des services si c'est pour être aussi lent... En tout cas, il existe de biens meilleures options Apportez-votre-vin dans la même fourchette de prix à Montréal (notamment, l'État-Major). C'était sympathique pour une fête, mais je n'y retournerais jamais sans y être obligée."}
{"text":"Yumm ine of the best byow restos out in Montreal. Must try the lamb shank if you're looking to get blown away.  Aside that loved the area up a nice walk in the plateau and in a small touristy place. They do get jam packed so make sure you reserve ahead. Waiter service attentive and sharp. The ambiance: just cozy and romantic a nice place to chat up with two or 3 friends or a loved one. It really really gets nicer in the night with the dark look and candlelight spotlights ; )"}
{"text":"Would give this 2 1/2 stars if I could.  Overall this place just didn't deliver. The setup is cute, but a little too bright. It also gets very noisy, probably because there is very little space between the tables.  The menu showcased many odd / surprising food combinations. I came in curious to see how these would turn out. The trout tartar was nice but could have used more salt and a little extra punch. I then had the tuna and sweet breads, which were just sitting on chopped zucchini and a soggy, watery tomato sauce - which also could have use more salt. The tuna wasn't cooked well either. They offer nice proteins but the execution was too poor for us to enjoy. However, those who stuck with something more classic (red meat options) were hugely satisfied and loved their dishes. Maybe the secret is not to get too adventurous when eating at La Prunelle. Other good side is the BYOB because the prices are quite high - around 50$-55$ per person, without tax / service. Too many good places in Montreal for me to go back there."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant in years and then all of a sudden I went twice in less than a week! The first time was for mtl a table. I started with the lamb tataki with foie gras and marinated chanterelles. This was my favorite dish of the night. it was so delicious! I never had lamb tataki before. The slices were very thin. I then had the pork belly with apple & bourbon glaze and the pork filet. The pork belly was better than the pork filet. I found the latter to be more on the dry side which is normal. My aunt had the seared black cod with Jerusalem artichokes chips and grilled corn.I took a bite and it was very good! It was better than some that I've had in Montreal. Lastly we shared the butternut squash cake with salted caramel, chai tea and  mascarpone marinated clementine and the crème brulée. Both desserts were very good. The butternut squash cake was similar to carrot cake. I've never had butternut squash cake before but it's good. Good to know that it's not only good in soups Lol.   I also went back on the Monday with two of my girl friends for the $1 oysters. I found out about it when I went to reserve online for mtl a table. Once I saw the ad on the La Prunelle website I knew I had to go back because $1 oysters and BYOB is so up my alley!! We had four dozen oysters. They were small and I don't know why but every so often I had peices of the shell in my mouth which I didn't enjoy very much. The oysters itself tasted fine and were fresh but yet $1 oysters at flyjin are so much bigger and better. We also shared three entrées:the  grilled octopus , the salmon rillette and the beef tartare. My favorite was the grilled octopus. It was so good!! It was cooked to perfection and there was jalapeno but it wasn't spicy and even squid ink. The salmon rillette is like a paté but wit fish. It was good but prob my least favorite of the three. The beef tartare was also good but nothing special.   I recommend this resto if you want a good French BYOB ! It's a good date place or even a resto to drink and eat good food with friends."}
{"text":"a like the ambiance, the location, service was good but slow.  the appetizer i had was mushroom very good taste but too salty, main course i had the beef shoulder something i make in the slow cooker taste the same but i like the presentation on the sweet patato puree, the fried calmari was a nice touch but it was saugy in the batter since ot got all mixed up with the sauce, desert was the chocolate tart very dense i liked but my partner's green tea creme brulee was not very good. would not cole back for a while but will give another chance."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.   We payed for the chef's menu ($50) and charging extra for tea, certain appetizers, or cafe au lait is absurd.  Give me a break.    The lamb was fantastic - 5 stars Sturgeon - 3 stars  Mushrooms - 4 stars foie gras - 2 stars Menu - 1 star.  Extra pricing was obnoxious.   Not bad.  Not great.  The location saves it."}
{"text":"After passing by this restaurant on numerous occasions, I finally got a chance to try it on an outing with my colleagues. Unfortunately, this experience was not a positive one. While the ambiance and plating of the dishes were lovely, the quality of the food didn't quite match the overall appearance.   To start, the chorizo black pudding was actually quite pleasant. However, the trouble arose with the main course: another person and I both ordered the black cod, which turned out to be a mistake. It arrived at the table smelling like a fresh seafood market, was extremely chewy, all of which indicated that it was extremely underdone. When told, our waiter took back the dishes with a gruff and had new ones prepared. Painstakingly, we watched as everyone else finished their mains until ours returned to us after quite some time with an explanation that the original piece had come from a fattier part of the fish that didn't have to be cooked quite so much. We questioned why a restaurant of such caliber would bother serving such a thing in the first place as we ravenously dug into our new pieces of cod, which were admittedly much better. Unfortunately, my time with my food was cut abruptly short as the server took away my half-eaten dish without asking me first.   Mistakenly, I thought that dessert and a coffee could save the day. However, my crème brûlée ended up being far too burnt on the top and suspiciously chewy underneath, while a colleague's was prepared better and was thus far smoother. The coffee also tasted like vaguely caffeinated hot water. Considering the price tag, the lack of consistency from this restaurant was extremely jarring. The service could have also been better, but I'll let that slide considering there was only one waiter for the entire restaurant (and he was kind of cute, I guess). At least it was BYOW to aid us in forgetting about this meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there last week,St. Jean Baptist eve. The food was delicious, but it was very noisy. There was a very large party, the people stood around in the open area between the tables talking loudly. We were first seated at a small table,with some people virtually hanging over us. The wait staff went out of their way to find us a quieter spot. The maitre d' served us herself and paid special attention  to us. I must commend her for her diligence."}
