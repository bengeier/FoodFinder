{"text":"Located near the Consol Energy Center, I stopped by Saturday evening before a Pittsburgh Power game to get some dinner.

I had the pork chop with collard greens and green beans (apparently ribs only available on Sundays). I was the only one eating at the time and preparation took 15 minutes, so I guess they were making everything just for me. The pork chop was lightly breaded and fried which came as a surprise, but was quite good. The two vegetables were very good cooked with a little pork and the green beans had some onion and carrots if I recall. Small hunk of heated corn bread is a nice touch. All for well under $10.

There were a few local at the bar. When I walk by after the game, there seem to be lots more people. Someone on the street told me its a favorite haunt for locals. Kitchen is open until midnight everyday and later on some days.

Definitely good eats to save a few bucks before events at the Consol Energy Center."}
