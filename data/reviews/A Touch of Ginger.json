{"text":"I'm pretty leery going into places in basements, I blame my work for ingraining hyper awareness on fire & safety into me.

But once I was seated and got past that, I was prepared to try \"the best Viet soup in downtown\". That was a direct quote from best friend who took me here. He frequents this place almost weekly and said it was a hidden gem.

We both got sate soup, I got beef and he got chicken.

I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't sure what to expect. Most of the best pho places are in the NE and I have yet to find a good one downtown.

My soup came out with chunks of cucumber and tomatoes in it, which was a bit unusual. But I looked past that, added a couple dollops of sate sauce (our waitress said the cook is very heavy handed with it and it's best we add it ourselves).

The broth was different than most pho I've had, it had hints of coconut and what almost like a Tom Yum soup base? Whatever it was, it was pretty dang good.

My friend was right, I've been back with him a handful of times because it is the best Viet soup I've had downtown."}
{"text":"Pricey for the small portions.  A vermicelli bowl with beef, chicken and three prawns was $13.95 and while the meat was nicely marinated, the portion of vermicelli was about one dried vermicelli \"patty\"'s worth, which is pretty tiny.  There wasn't much vegetables in it either."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday looking for the Dragon dim sum restaurant that was closed and this Thai Vietnamese fusion place was in the lower floor. It's not a typical Asian restaurant with dozens of dishes featuring small variations of ingredients, and with table sharing in mind. Typically each diner will order just for themselves although some sharing can happen with appetizers. Selections are grouped into Vietnamese sandwiches, pho soups, dry pho with veg/meat, fried noodles as well as appetizers and desserts. They made each dish its own little special concoction and don't overwhelm you with choices.

It's fusion which means Thai spiciness and flavour in Vietnamese dishes. I had the Chef Special Pho soup and it was excellent. Handmade dumplings, shredded meat and veggies with vermicelli and a spicy broth. Other diner had dry pho/vermicelli with chicken/veg and he said it was very good. Thai dumplings to start were freshly made and nice.

Bill was $41 with tip and no drinks. Environment is very nice and you could go there for a date and feel like you're stepping up a little."}
