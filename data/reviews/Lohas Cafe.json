{"text":"I love this place... the drinks and dessert may not be the best.  (That's why I didn't rate for 5,) But the food here are boom.. it's hard to choose a favourite one, but All of their noddles related dishes are super boom. Randomly choose one it will surprise you~ I will not recommend this place if you like fancy desserts or drinks,  they are really like um. Not so good not so bad.  But if you like Taiwanese \"road side\" food, definitely try this place."}
{"text":"- Happy to see Lohas again, used to be a fan when it was at First Markham Place location
- They no longer offer Taiwanese Beef Noodle (?????) - felt a little bit disappointed
- Like the size of the drinks, but Taro Milk Tea was not flavourful enough
- I don't like oily food, but the ??? was actually quite good, doesn't feel greasy at all
- Overall - I would love to visit again"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch. Debit or cash only. Ordered chicken cutlet noodles and the spicy popcorn chicken. Noodles and soup were great but the chicken cutlet was just ok. The four pieces of chicken may have been fried a little too long because the breading was a bit hard. My 6yo, who usually loves chicken cutlet, didn't like it much. The spicy popcorn chicken was pretty good. Nicely seasoned and lots to share. From 12-2:30 and 6-8:30 you can get a free drink (four choices) w/the purchase of a main. We got a lychee black tea and a milk black tea which were served in large glass milk bottles. Would like to come back to try other items. Owner was very friendly."}
{"text":"The decor is decent. It's a small cafe with a home-like or cozy vibe. I ordered the braised beef with stewed egg on rice. It was mediocre: nothing special. Papa's changs is much better with more taste. 

My friend ordered the spicy popcorn chicken with noodles in soup. Her noodles were overcooked. They were extremely soft and the soup was bland. I tried to dunk some of the popcorn chicken into the soup to give it more taste. Nothing, it didn't help. We both couldn't finish her one dish... the popcorn chicken was decent though. But, unlike Papa Chang's, there was no mayonnaise-like dip to go with it. 

However, just as we were eating the chicken, my friend saw something sticking out hers. She told me it was a hair and I inspected it. Yup, there indeed was a tiny black strand of hair sticking out of the chicken... she told one of the employees. He was an older man and he inspected the chicken. He thought it wasn't a hair and it was just something from the chicken... ok look, let's be real, what piece of black thread-like/hair-like thing would be coming out of a chicken and sticking straight out (note that my friend had taken a bite of the chicken and it was embedded or sticking up from the chicken... not outside of the chicken). 

So then, another employee came, looked at it, everyone was confused about what it really was (or at least the employees were) but now she tried to tell us it wasn't a strand of hair and that she cooked it herself. She said that she has red hair (black hair that had been dyed red) and that her hair is long so it couldn'y possibly be hers. Well... I looked at her and her roots were black and growing. It could have very much been her baby hair. I would have taken a picture if that male employee didn't take it out and threw it. I'm kind of skeptical with him only because he was much older and seemed to have a hard time seeing it. 

Now, the brick toast was good. But then again, anything with condensed milk is pretty good. They seemed to have seared the top of the toast. I liked it, but that's because I like sweet things. It's somethjng that's really simple too. Now, my friend stopped eating it after she discovered the hair though. 

Overall, would I go back? Nah, i'll probably go to Papa Changs if I wanted Taiwanese food. The food at Lohas was a little less than average. Both of the main dishes needed more flavour and nothing from Lohas really stood out to me."}
{"text":"Convenient location close to T&T super market. Restaurant caf√© style with substantial greeneries (would have been nicer if they are not plastic) Dishes are reasonably priced. Meals come with a drink. Good portion and presentation. Seafood casserole has good variety of seafood. Pop corn chicken is flavorful. The taste of the drink feels a bit off. Not something I will order on their own even when I'm thirsty. I'm on the verge of giving a two star because of the drink."}
{"text":"Went here with my friend. Something was wrong with the food \"hygienic issue\". And they blamed it on the packaging... didn't even apologize. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Braised Pork & Stewed Egg ($7.95), it tasted okay not very flavourful though. The egg was also a bit overcooked in my opinion. Also shared a matcha milk tea ($4.95), which wasn't great - wasn't even offered tapioca. 

No water was offered at any point during the meal and I had to ask twice for them to give me utensils to eat after the food was delivered. 

There's a promo for 12% discount if you post on social media and if you spend $20+, you get free dessert. They also don't accept credit cards. The place looked nice with limited seating but probably won't come back as the food wasn't great - and neither was the service."}
{"text":"Nice small Taiwanese restaurant with good quality food and nice presentation. Went in due to the smell of spicy fried chicken and was not disappointed. 

The seafood green curry came with brown rice and had a large prawn, muscle, chopped up squid, and tiny shrimps and other small bits of real seafood. Though relatively small in portions, was good enough to keep you full. Though the side was some sort of seaweed that wasn't to my liking, the waitress was kind enough to offer a different side.

They only take Canadian debit cards and cash so come prepared"}
{"text":"Very good place, comfy and quiet seating delivered at affordable prices with nice owners"}
{"text":"I ordered four dishes but they only delivered three because they forgot to write the last one down :( the food was mediocre as it tasted either too salty or was too bland. The fried squid balls were a disappointment to me. We had to send back the hot pot for the chef to cook because the heat underneath the pot wasn't hot enough to cook the ingredients (especially the meat - which was pretty thinly sliced). I did enjoy the little dessert they gave for ordering over $20ish? Staff was very friendly and nice tho."}
{"text":"Food
It was alright. Your typical Taiwanese food stop for popcorn chicken lols. Their prices were meh okay, not too pricey, not too cheap. Mediocre in quality. Popcorn chicken was average, wasabi fries were actually good, the noodles were edible, but the buns were SO BAD. The meat inside the buns were soft but the bun itself was so tough. Like dude, did you even steam it properly?

Service
This restaurant is small, maybe 10 tables max (probably not even). My friends and I came on a Friday night, and only half the restaurant was filled. Sure, whatever. Only 2 people were working in the front and it took them forever to get our orders. I waved my hand once, she acknowledged, still waiting, waved my hand again, she told me to give her a minute. You will have to ask for water refills because they are too busy to care. The waitress was nice when she finally came around, but nope I won't be coming back lols."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and cozy located in the T&T plaza. I came here during lunch hours and ordered their lunch combo that comes with a drink for $10.95. I thought the price, quality, quantity was decent overall. I tried their minced pork purple rice with marinated egg and pork cutlet noodles in soup with lychee black tea. The lychee black tea was refreshing. But the broth for the noodles was very bland. Pork cutlet was crispy and well seasoned. I thought the fact that the typical Taiwanese minced pork rice was done with purple rice was pretty different and interesting."}
{"text":"This place is so much smaller than I expected.  Low on staff, so we have to seat ourselves.  Decor is alright.  Menu choices are limited.  Food tastes fine.  Drinks taste fine.  Service is ok.  Got free dessert though."}
{"text":"A quaint little restaurant and Cafe themed place. I went early so it wasn't too busy and got to really enjoy the look and appeal to the place. 

It's got a very chill and vibe serving mainly Taiwanese inspired dishes. It's a lovely little business owned by a family so everything is done very particular. 

I ordered the popcorn chicken rice which is many Taiwanese restaurant staple. I had to try this to compare it to other places like papa cheng and cha me cha to name a few. The chicken was fried on the spot so it was very crispy and very flavourful. The rice was the purple grained rice which I've seen in many korean fishes previously as well as a side of vinegar based cabbages to help with the heaviness of the dish. Although I've had this dish many times before I would say this place does it very well."}
{"text":"We came here for N2 to get some nitrogen ice cream actually- but since they open at 2:30pm, we decided to do a mini food crawl at the place next door. 
I got a Taiwanese bbq sausage set that came with purple rice. With the purchase of a meal you also get a free bbt. Very yums, very clean, and very nice owners."}
{"text":"Yay Lohan is back!!! I am so excited because this was my go to resturant for all time. 

The place is nice and quiet. The service is really good too. I got the popcorn chicken  and my husband got the pork belly. The pork belly was really good!!! 

I will def be back to try for other stuff that's on the menu. This place might be my new go to spot from now on again!"}
{"text":"The food was only okay. I think I expected more flavour considering the good ratings. The drinks are pretty good and it comes in a big glass :)

The atmosphere is a small cafe for groups of 4. Good place to do work because it's not loud.

The workers are very nice!"}
{"text":"A typical hk cafe that supposedly used to reside within first markham place. I was prompted to try the chicken risotto as it was recommended by the staff. My overall impression of the food was that it was extremely bland (nevermind the fact that it was definitely not a risotto in any way shape or form) it was an odd mish mah of red bean rice, with a layer of a mushroom cream sauce (Campbell's cream of mushroom soup?) baked with cheese, onions, and this odd minced chicken meat on rice. For 11 dollars it was extremely underwhelming and reminiscent of something I might grab from a cheap Chinese food court for 5 bucks. It lacked savory flavor, had the texture of something that was missed together, and there was no distinction between the ingredients next to voting degrees of saltiness. It also included a side small salad that had an impromptu thousand island sauce (literally mayonnaise and ketchup mixed together). Overall it's the type of place I definitely would not go out of my way to try but might eat at if there were no other options nearby. Very mediocre."}
{"text":"We were drawn in by the distinct smell of popcorn chicken from several restaurants down and I knew we had to eat there. I'm glad we did! We got the Danzai noodles and popcorn chicken. They were out of rice so I switched to noodles despite being worried about the soup base, as usually it comes either bland or super salty. I was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice clean base that I enjoyed more than I thought. The popcorn chicken was battered really nicely but was lacking some flavour to me... Especially since I had such high expectations from smelling it outside. Perhaps I'd opt for the spicy one next time. The Danzai noodles were good and flavourful but I wish there a little more to it, toppings wise. It came with two drinks as it was the dinner special. We choose the milk black tea and lychee tea. This was really the highlight of the meal to us. You could tell it's not sugar powder and could taste the strong smooth tea. Its sweet yet not overpowering. Definitely recommend their drinks, especially the milk black tea! All in all, we really enjoyed our meal and we will be back again!"}
{"text":"I had the popcorn chicken rice meal last night. I really enjoyed the meal - the Taiwanese style popcorn chicken was really good. Moist on the inside and not overly breaded/salted. It was a very good portion size for the price! 

My girlfriend had the seafood risotto, and it turned out very good as well. There was a decent amount of seafood mixed into the dish - they did not skimp out on the ingredients. Very good portion size as well. 

The place is cozy, but very clean. Very comfortable setting.

We went later in the evening, so we got a drink with our meal since it was during \"tea time\". We didn't know they had this promotion and the server was the one who mentioned it and said he could include it with our meals, even though what we ordered was not technically part of the promotion. This says a lot about the service/business, as some would just not mention it and pocket the savings. 

Would definitely come again to try the other food!"}
{"text":"The decor was neat and cute, very much like a cafe + library feel. The whole place, although tiny, was very cute. Their music is a little loud, though. 

I ordered the condensed milk brick toast. Wow that was 5/5 for sure! They put about 2-3cm thick of condensed milk in top. They already precut a little so you know where to cut. It comes to you warm and when you cut into it, the milk seeps into the cuts you've made. Tasted splendidly! 

One of my friends ordered a matcha brick toast and it smelled divine. They torch the edges a little for both brick toasts which really elevates the complex flavours of the topping. 

The toast was 4.95, which I think is a bit pricey for bread and sauce. Maybe if it was 3.95 it would be better received. 

I'll try the popcorn chicken next time since it's so famous. I wouldn't actively come here but I don't mind snacking here."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to do a mini food crawl and lohas cafe was our first stop. We walked in to a cafe with very cute decor. It had a more modern style rather than your typical Asian cafe feel. The place was rather small and only had a few seating.

Since we didn't want to fill up too much at the beginning of our food crawl, my friend and I only ordered the popcorn chicken with rice. The popcorn chicken itself had a good amount of seasoning and it was paired with purple rice, vegetables, and pickled cabbage. The pickled cabbage gave it a refreshing taste after eating fried and season chicken. The chicken itself was not too dry which is good compared to other Taiwanese places. The overall price was around $12 which is decent for the portion.

Overall, it is 3.5/5 since this place is one of your typical Taiwanese cafes but with nice decor."}
{"text":"Great Taiwanese food find.  We had a broad set of items from popcorn chicken, hot pot seafood Udon, ground pork noodle and baked seafood pasta.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  In addition, their combo comes with a milk tea and they even gave us a free surprise jello desert.  Great Taiwanese place if you are near Unionville."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd give a place 5 stars but our visit definitely deserved it. We went a couple of weeks ago for lunch over the weekend and ordered the pork belly rice, spicy popcorn chicken rice, and minced pork noodles. The pork belly literally melted in my mouth and all the dishes were delish, but that's not why I'm giving it 5 stars. My toddler was throwing a tantrum the entire time and both the owner and the waitress went out of their way to make us comfortable, checking on us often to see if they could help us with anything. The owner would chat with our tot to try to cheer her up. He brought a smaller cup and straw for her to drink her strawberry smoothie without us asking, and the waitress even later snuck over a cup of frozen yogurt for our crazy tot. She also reminded us of the promotion where if you take a picture of their place and post to social media, you'd get a discount and additional free dessert. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and by the time we left, even my child who usually has an aversion to strangers was happily waving everyone bye."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I use to work at their previous location 5 years ago.   

That aside, this is my favourite place for Taiwanese Food!  

We went their on soft & grand opening (totally by coincidence) and food and drinks were just like we remembered!  They have some new items and kept most of the favourites.
 

Food
======
We ordered Spicy Popcorn Chicken Rice & the Crispy Chicken Cutlet Rice.

Both chicken dishes had a satisfying crunch to them.  The Spicy Popcorn Chicken was seasoned well--I really like the new twist on an old favourite :).

I miss the deep fried basil leaves that you get on regular Popcorn Chicken hahaha, but you can't have everything.

The chicken cutlet has more of a crunch than the Popcorn Chicken.  Nicely seasoned and very juicy!

The Rice at Lohas always came with a stewed meat sauce on top.  It still does and it still tastes just like we remember.

The side dishes have always been really good and you always want more after!  Seriously, this stuff is addictive--so you've been warned! They are usually pickled veggies of some sort; the seasoning and balance is just perfect for my own taste.

The veggies on the side were a nice and simple compliment to the overall dish.


Drinks
=======
Forget all the crazy flavours, twists and combinations you see out there in bubble-tea-land as it is right now.

I don't particularly care for them so my view on bubble tea is biased.  I like to be able to taste the tea, and all the aromatics the tea had to offer.  My eyes and taste buds were opened to this in my prior training at Lohas.

Anywhere else, the tea is either bitter, flat or flavourless.  

But, at Lohas, order a Honey Green tea and really taste it.  The tea is the star of the show, and the honey is there supporting it.  Same with the staple drink, milk black tea with tapioca.

So simple, but so hard to do right--because you need people that care about the drink every step of the way.

All this to say, I'm so happy that Lohas is back and the community has a place where the food and drinks are made with care and passion.  It's not something you can find in franchise and chain stores.


Overall
========
Yes it's a full five stars, yes I may be a little biased, yes there may be a bit of nostalgia playing a part here, but I can only write what I feel!

We've been there twice now since soft open and we will be coming back for sure!

It's so great to once again have delicious Taiwanese food and drinks back in Markham."}
{"text":"I love how cozy this place feels, service was great & food was very authentically made. I like food menus that are not too clustered & confusing, which this place kept their menu straightforward simple, which I like! And I love how humble & friendly this place is :) the popcorn chicken was seasoned well, nice & crispy and wasn't too oily. Their basil chicken was served on a sizzling pan, which made the dish richer than other places. I love how this place used clear noodle soup base & purple rice to pair with the mains, feels much like home!"}
{"text":"Happy that this restaurant is back! I always came here for their popcorn chicken. Super crispy and flavourful. I love how they serve assorted rice, slightly healthier option than plain white rice at most restaurants. We ordered our usual dishes, the Taiwanese sausage rice and the popcorn chicken on rice. The sausage tastes amazing with a honey like glaze but the sauce drizzled over the rice could be less salty in our opinion. The popcorn chicken was super crispy, a few pieces had more seasoning and was a tad bit more salty than we liked. 
We didn't order their cold noodles but it's pretty unbeatable compared to other noodle places. 

They had a 15% off promotion for the opening of the store. Was a bit disappointed that they no longer have the meal+drink combo like before. Prices are higher but I think the quality has improved from before."}
{"text":"Came here a few times; for both lunch and dinner.  The place is small but cozy.  The service was quick and pleasant.  I like their chicken cold noodle with sesame and spicy sauce and glutinous rice in bamboo tube with mushroom sauce.  Serradua; sawdust pudding; the whipped cream wasn't firmed enough and too much crushed biscuits."}
{"text":"A little background on why I chose this place, I was hungry and looking for a place to eat while waiting for my GP appointment to happen. The ambiance in this place is quite relaxing and I love the fact that it wasn't pack on the time I arrived. I ordered myself a pudding milk tea and chicken risotto, however I replaced it for fusillini. The main meal comes with a salad. The pudding milk tea is pretty good and that is probably because I enjoy the taste of pudding so it didn't affect the sweetness for me, although for other, they might prefer less sweet, the size is quite big so that's a good thing. Moving on to my chicken fusillini, it comes in a small bowl and was presented together with the salad, everything was fine UNTIL I found a hair in my salad when I was near finishing... yeah pretty gross, HOWEVER, when I brought this up to the staff they were sorry about it and asked me if I would like to work things out, my intention was to correct them that was not good to give food to the customer when they have added secret ingredient(in this case, hair), I never intended to get anything and was only expected reduction in price for my food, but I got a dessert on the house. This place would of gotten 4 star if is not because of the hair mistake, we all learn from our mistakes, therefore I would consider giving them another chance. Staff are friendly so yeah, there you go. Do better next time guys!"}
{"text":"This location opened just a few weeks ago (previously they were at First Markham Place) and currently having grand opening special. If you post on their social media you get 12% off and a small dessert if you spend over $20. It is small, I think it seats about 24 people. We came for a late lunch around 1:30pm on a holiday and did not need to wait. Restaurant was full while we were there. We ordered the regular and spicy popcorn chicken. The spicy isn't spicy, it just gave it a different flavour. Enjoyed both, the chicken was juicy and fried nicely. Also good portions. We also tried their stuffed bun which was marinated pork belly with pickled vegetables. They were very tasty, but wish there was a better bun to stuffing ratio. Overall food and service was good, and portions were great! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to see Lohas open up at Langham plaza on a trip to T&T earlier this month. I used to frequent Lohas when it was still at FMP so knew I had to check out its new location. My best friend and I came here for dinner on a Thursday night. When we arrived (at 7) the shop was empty. The restaurant is small but with cute decor and a warm ambience. We ordered curry beef rice, two-sauce cold noodles, spicy popcorn chicken and two bubble teas and a \"healthy\" tea to end our meal. Our initial server was very friendly, helpful and diligent in taking our order. Our food arrived shortly after. All meals were plated/served with some thought, which I appreciated. The beef in the curry was melt-in-your-mouth and perfectly stewed. I found the curry itself to be muted in taste. I really enjoyed the two sauce cold noodles served with veggies and shredded meat. The sauce was a combo of sesame, spice, and garlic... Rich and tasty! The bbt's were served in large glasses and I particularly enjoyed my white peach green tea with large chunks of aloe jelly. We sat around for almost 3 hours chatting and the restaurant eventually did fill up with families and some couples. I saw quite a number of people drop in to pick up take out as well. Towards the end of the night, the service fell off a bit as it took several \"excuse me's\" and even me waving my hand profusely to get the attention of the server to get more water, order a tea and get the bill. Overall, cute little spot with good food. Would definitely return to try their desserts next time."}
{"text":"I ordered the matcha milk tea ($4.95). It wasn't the best, it tasted a bit powdery and there wasn't much matcha flavour. 

While the decor and ambience of the restaurant was nice, the service wasn't the best. The speed of service could have been better. The drinks and food we ordered took a while to come despite the fact that the restaurant was half empty and everyone else was already waited on and eating. We had to ask them twice to bring utensils and they didn't provide us with any water. 

They told us about their promos which was great. They have a 12% discount if you post a picture of their food on social media (yelp counts!) and they give you a free dessert if you spend more than $20."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Mainly because this place is very tiny. It only seats about 20-24 people max! If they come in parties of 2 or more. It's a small and cozy place that serves a variety of Taiwanese dishes, desserts, and tea. It's quite cute for a quiet lunch or afternoon bite. 

The early grey milk tea($4.75) is definitely a favourite. It actually tastes like earl grey! I mean... I've had people give me regular milk tea saying it's earl grey... but this place serves earl grey for sure! The tea is quite smooth and sizing and price is pretty normal compared to other places. They only have one size for drinks (as seen on menu). 

Fruit parfait($6-7) is always a go to with some tea. Great for dessert at night or simply a afternoon tea session. They serve the nuts on the side and it's served with fresh fruits only. It looks pretty cute too! The thickness of the yogurt they serve it with is just right! It's rich in diary taste and the hint of sweetness goes perfectly well with the semi sour fruits!"}
{"text":"I only had few of their items on the menu so I can't give a full review but the pop corn chicken was crispy and juicy and presentation weren't bad. The rice in the bamboo was alright. It's just purple rice in a bamboo. There was no taste to it. You have to dip your rice into the honey beside to have some sweet taste. I guess this count as dessert in a way because it's sweet if you use the honey. I will go back again and try out their other items."}
{"text":"I have always followed this couple to their Taiwanese restaurants.  I have never been disappointed.  At this new location, their menu is more interesting.  They have actually Chinese style risotto with salad. Drinks choices are great as usual.  More desserts to choose from too.  Nice decor,  very clean place, very friendly staff.  Open till 11pm on weekdays.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"3.5

Pros:
Unique Taiwanese items
Friendly service

Cons:
No beef noodle?

Being a fan of Taiwanese food, eventually coming to Lohas was a given.  I've been told this is the same restaurant as the one that used to be at First Markham.  I enjoyed my experience there so I had high hopes for this place as well.

This location is much much smaller than their previous one.  There are 4 4-person tables (which theoretically can be split into 2 person tables) and 2 2-person tables near the door.  Is the place is busy, it can be rather tough to get a seat.  We were very fortunate that when we came with our 2 little ones, a tale just became free. Because of the small seats, I don't recommend bringing strollers unless they are able to fold up like ours can.

Looking at the menu, I can see that they have a good assortment of items to choose from.  They even have some fusion items like risotto and panini.  I might consider coming back to try their take on the risotto.  One notable omission though, no beef noodle?  When I think Taiwanese food, one of the first things I look for is beef noodle.  Beef noodle is the dish I use to benchmark Taiwanese restaurants.  If they do a good beef noodle, it usually means everything else is going to be pretty good as well.  In terms of just soup noodles in general, they don't have much too to be honest.

I ordered the popcorn chicken noodles and my GF got the basil chicken with rice.  She ordered one of their healthy teas I got a chocolate milk tea to share with my little one.  The basil chicken was pretty well done and served over a tiny cast iron skillet.  The presentation was quite nice.  My noodle was a different story.  It was just noodles in a plain broth.  It didn't have much taste to be honest.  The popcorn chicken was pretty good though.  My little one really enjoyed it so much that she ended up almost eating half of it by herself.  

The teas were pretty standard.  They only have one size for milk teas but you get a very large glass when you order it.  It comes at a very good size for that price so value wise, it's terrific.

The server was really nice and polite throughout our meal.  Because of the size of this place, she's probably working by herself for the most part.  No matter how busy it got, she always managed to greet customers with a smile.  

For the most part, I like this iteration of Lohas.  Maybe not as much as their previous location though.  It's still a solid choice for Taiwanese food as long as your not craving soup noodles."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far.. the food I have had so far is 4 stars.. so I would crave and also recommend it.. pricing is 2 stars.. so overall, 3 star rating

2 rice dinners and a Taiwanese style fried chicken was over $50 plus tip.. so just under $60.. too much for a small cafe...

The Taiwanese Style Minced Beef Rice was good. Made with brown rice! I would say it's pretty top notch, but at the end of the day, it is a simple dish - even tho it was really really good, it's still not high end dining.. 2 Rice and a appetizer was just under $60..

Also, they used to be located in First Markham Place, they have moved to Langham Square at Kennedy and 407, menu prices have almost doubled.. probably won't return again.."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of having lunch at this petite cafe located in the TNT plaza on Kennedy. It was a cute and pleasant location to spend my lunch break with my coworkers compared to neighbouring restaurants. 

I ordered the Roasted Eel Rice Lunch Special $10.95+ $2 Black Tea and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of my meal! The rice was a mixed red rice complimented with the eel very well.The only thing I would recommend is to have less sauce in the rice. Oh, and the service was amazing!

I will be back to try mooooreee!"}
{"text":"Great risotto. Not too soft not too soupy with just enough seafood. The purple rice tastes really nice and chewy ! Very polite and speedy service as well."}
{"text":"Lohas Cafe is back! My group happened to stumble across them on their grand opening today. The shop is a lot smaller than their previous location at First Markham Place but it all adds to the coziness and comfort (there's seating for roughly 22 people). The boss was super friendly! Service was a bit slow but that may be because they are still settling into this new space. 

Their menu has downsized, for example, there's fewer milk tea flavors and they took out the slushies and yakult. Perhaps this is just their initial menu? But majority of it has remained the same with increased prices. 

The 3.5 stars is for the drinks and marshmallow toast that we ordered. I'm a fan of the rose tea and earl grey milk tea! But overall I found their drinks too sweet, for example, even the earl grey milk tea was sweet when no sugar was requested. I was surprised that the gingseng medler hot tea was served with honey already mixed in, rather than on the side. As for the marshmallow toast, it was layered with peanut butter and banana and drizzled with chocolate sauce- yum!

I foresee my group returning to Lohas Cafe as it's a convenient location and a great alternative away from the crowds.  I'm also looking forward to trying their appetizers and rice!"}
{"text":"Even after dinner I was still hungry so I wanted to snack and drink bubble tea. I remembered langham square had a cafe named lohas which met all my criteria. I went with my boyfriend and a friend, they were pretty much stuffed so my boyfriend ordered a hot chocolate, while I ordered a hot milk tea with tapioca, condensed milk brick toast, and popcorn chicken. It's a small little place but it felt super cozy and welcoming. I think it's been awhile since I experienced this amazing customer service I was receiving. The staff were super attentive and polite. It felt just like the old Lohas which use to be at FMP. I was a little disappointed that they took the cheesecake off the menu. I found that the drinks and popcorn chicken were only decent. The brick toast was really good. I'll definitely come back to try all they're other amazing menu items. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Their food is not bad. Just not a lot of choices.  Friendly service. Quiet.
Pop corn chicken was good. Crispy out tender in. 
The steam stuffed bun is good just that too much relish covering the taste of the pork belly.  
Do not order the stuffed fish ball soup....."}
{"text":"Decent enough. Tried the crispy chicken cutlet and it was okay. I expected a bit more meat like the picture but it was a fair amount. We got there at 6 so they had a meal deal where you can order a main and get a free drink like milk black tea. About $10 mains 

Great service. Quiet cafe and not many people were eating here. But made for some good conversation with friends!"}
{"text":"Small and quiet sit-in with a good amount of warmth for a meal for 2. Came past 6PM for their meal time special (comes with a free jasmine tea, lychee tea, milk black tea, or milk green tea with purchase of any main). Ordered the taiwanese popcorn chicken with rice and chicken risotto and 2 orders of milk black tea based on what was popular on Yelp.

The popcorn chicken was decent. I would say better than mediocre because of the black rice.

The chicken risotto will not meet your expectation for real risotto, but their rendition was acceptable, tasty. 

I expected the milk black tea to be pre-made for high demand (since it was during the meal time special) but, again, just OK. Would not order it on its own for full price. 

I wouldn't shoot them down or really recommend this place. If I revisited, I'd explore other menu items."}
{"text":"A small and cute asian/taiwanese restaurant that has a selection of meals, drinks, and desserts! The menu has quite a selection of lunch/dinner and snack dishes, but their dessert menu is not as extensive as others such as zen Q or cha me cha. 

My friends ordered popcorn chicken and it looked REALLY good and tasted great too. I ordered their taro bubble tea (since I wanted to compare their bubble tea with other places) and I found it to be quite tasteless. There wasn't enough taro flavour and when I asked for more they came back with a newly made drink but it also had NO flavour! My other friend ordered a grass jelly dessert and the dessert was a SOUP (as in it was LIQUID and not jelly at all) when it came out. It started to solidify a little more as the time went on, but they really should have let it solidify first before presenting it to my friend--it ended up looking like a mess. They still had their grand opening special where you spend $20+ and you get a tiny free dessert. The free dessert is enough for one person only, but it was quite creamy and satisfying (almost like tiramisu). 

Overall, it was an average experience here. I might come back for the cooked foods as the popcorn chicken was tasty and the rest of the lunch/dinner menu seemed interesting. But for desserts, I'll be heading across the plaza for that."}
{"text":"Lohas is back! This new location of theirs is a lot smaller so the menu shrunk quite a bit. Must say I am quite sad they don't have a couple of my favorite menu items from their old location. When I asked the owner he mentioned it's cause their kitchen place is a lot smaller. 

Mini Gua Bao ($6.95 for 3) 
I personally love eating Gua baos, which are steamed buns stuffed with taiwanese braised pork, parsley, pickled vegetables and crushed peanuts. This is one of my favorite taiwanese snack. Love the flavor, really tasty! Best part was the pork belly that was served weren't too fatty - I've had ones from other places that served essentially a whole chunk of fat but the ones here had a good balance between the fat and pork meat.

Popcorn Chicken rice ($9.95) 
Portion was decent, quite a lot of pieces of popcorn chicken. It was nice and crispy, a bit light in the seasoning and flavor but still good. I like how they served purple rice, not an authentic taiwanese style but it's healthier.

Pickled Vegetables and Minced Pork Noodles ($7.95)
I personally thought the minced pork meat was a little bland and not strong enough in flavor. Was tasty but I would have preferred it stronger in flavor. Decent portion, there were a lot of noodles but also enough meat and veggies to go with it all mixed up. 

There were some other appetizers that I want to come back and try. I will admit I am a little bias though since I've been following this couple that opened the original store for more than 10 years - from Times square to First Markham Place, and now to Langham place."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so clean and the people here are really nice!
I got the papaya smoothie and pork belly on rice. The drink was very good , and for the price being $6, the size was very reasonable. For the pork belly, I felt like they could have used some extra sauce, but other than that, overall, the food and the environment was really good."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The atmosphere and the service of the place was really comforting and welcoming! The cleanliness was awesome! Definitely would come again"}
{"text":"Love the family vibe at Lohas Cafe.

I came here to take advantage of their lunch offerings which includes a choice of hot or cold Taiwanese tea when you order an entree.

Food is homey and simple: a nice clean and home made taste. Just like eating in a small cafe in Taipei. 

We shared Donzai Noodles & Steamed Eggs and Popcorn Chicken with Rice. Both tasty and enjoyable.

Worth coming by if you want to have some down time or just chill with a friend. With the limited space and seating, I won't recommend for big groups."}
{"text":"A very small restaurant with very friendly staff and decent food. This new place looks interesting and surprisingly it was very small inside with limited seating. There were 2 staffs doing the runs and three probably in the kitchen. 

Ordered the spicy popcorn chicken, braised pork belly on rice, and also the braised pork with egg and noodle. All of them were seasoned fairly well and it was too salty or oily like other Taiwanese restaurants in the Markham area. The braised pork belly was nice and tender but the popcorn chicken was a little off on the spicy part. I didn't  find it being that spicy at all, it was more like regular popcorn chicken with the Taiwanese seasoning plus some spicy powder on top. The portions of food was pretty big and the drinks were fairly large.

I had a whiny toddler with me and they gave her frozen yogurt on the house to try and calm her down. For families with toddler thry only have one booster seat so bring your own if you need one."}
