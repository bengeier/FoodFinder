{"text":"It was really goid few years ago, now the new owners are from mainland china, the food can only  fool very  low expectations customers."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst chinese food ever! Coffee was bad..almost like its watered down. For the 13.50 I was better off to eat at 7/11 down the street.. fried rice?? Really...i think u just ad flavor to your steamed rice.. to the new owners..try a little harder.."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here for years now. We love the dell cafe. It brings back so many memories."}
{"text":"This little cafe is one of my favorite restaurants. The staff is what makes it special. You will always be greeted in the friendliest manner, your meal will be done to perfection, and the value is always excellent. No wonder the place is nearly always busy or packed."}
{"text":"Awesome chinese/american diner in Bowness.  Great breakfast with an eclectic crowd and good service.  This is a fab hangover place - no need to be fancy here.  It's comfortable and the food and prices reflect that!  I had the french toast and it was yum.  The table next to us was having a combo traditional breakfast with a side of chinese noodles that looked amazing.    It is always packed so expect a little wait."}
{"text":"Really like this spot for breakfast, you don't have to fight weekend line ups at other caf√©s, the food is good, and the prices are right. A very reliable hole in the wall that's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great local business in Bowness.  Awesome traditional Diner food and great Chinese Food. The burgers at the Dell are awesome.  If you like a big burger be very careful on what you order. The amount of ground beef in the single burger is probably like some triple burgers elsewhere.  I made the delicious mistake of ordering the  double.... I couldn't believe the weight of this burger...but I will order a mere single next time.  Great Food, Great Prices a definite recommend from this guy."}
{"text":"Good burgers, all homestyle food, friendly service. Old school! Has Chinese food as well. Not super inexpensive but very old school and good food."}
{"text":"This is a small hidden place in Bowness area. Since it is close to our home and based on a couple of reviews we read, we went there for brunch today. It was packed and we waited for 10 mins. They serve american as well as chinese food. I had omlete and my husband had a burger. Both were delicious. The price was really good too. I should mention that it's not a fancy place but the service was descent and fast.  I think it might become our usual spot for brunch, though the food was a bit greasy and I am not sure that's a healthy choice for every weekend ;)"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here.  As a couple reviewers mentioned, it's not in the greatest neighbourhood in Calgary but for us was very convenient to meet at.  Turns out it is a little hidden gem!  There are plenty of greasy spoons in a city, but this one actually wasn't so greasy!  In other words, it was your great little inexpensive bacon and eggs kind of spot, yet everything tasted fresh!  Tasted like they cleaned the kitchen regularly!  Travelling to the bathroom was a unique experience...I say \"travelling\" because you go down this old broken down hallway to a no less broken down bathroom...but hey, it adds to the experience and charm!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by with a group of 6 for lunch. On a rainy day there is nothing like comfort food. The meals were awesome, service was great and the prices were reasonable. Yeah. I got a grilled cheese with bacon and tomato with fries smothered in gravy and it was delicious! Ate every bite. The beef barley soup was one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Shoe leather disguised as Lemon chicken - so bad the dogs wouldn't eat it. The rest of the food was just as awful. It's like they've never cooked Chinese food before."}
{"text":"Breakfast YES!!! Nice place with no loud noise & felt welcomed. Nice place to chill with a view of Olympia jump with plenty of parking FREE."}
{"text":"A quick google search for a breakfast joint in the Bowness area led me to Dell.  As I pulled up, I wasn't sure my wheels would still be on my car when I came back out, but I was pretty hungry, so I went in.    The cafe was a unique feel, the menu was a mix of American/Chinese.  The decor was quite dated, but there was a comfortable feel about the place too.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  Looking around I got the sense that most of the other people there were regulars.  I had an omelette, hash browns and toast.  The food was really good.  Nicely done omelette, tasty hash browns and the toast I believe was bread from a local bakery.    Interesting place, not the greatest location, but I will go back!"}
{"text":"The Dell Cafe is probably more of a place for locals.  That's probably because it's hidden in a little strip mall on Bowness Road.  It's too bad because it's an adorable little place.  To me, the Dell Cafe seems like more a place you would sit down and have something to eat.  It would be kind of similar to a Denny's, but smaller, I guess.  You can do take out, if you want, but it seems like most people enjoy taking their time in this place.  And I can kind of see why.  It's always a little busy in this place.  That doesn't mean it's full up, but there has always been a couple other groups already in there when I go in.  The lady who normally waits on the tables is also the owner of the place so she actually takes pride in serving her tables and making sure everyone is happy.  It actually puts a little smile on my face to watch her interact with all her regular customers, or make friends with some new ones.  They have a somewhat strange menu for calling themselves a cafe.  The food consists of burgers, fries, hot dogs, sandwiches and soups.  They also have breakfast specials where you can get bacon and eggs and other breakfast favourites, but their normal menu is kind of different.  I like it.  The Dell Cafe: a little gem in a Bowness strip mall.  If Bowness were still it's own little town, the Dell Cafe would be where everyone goes to gossip over coffee and burgers.  A part of me wishes it was still a small town so I could be part of that!  :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great Chinese food! The western food they offer is also very good! You cannot beat the great prices and comfy atmosphere!"}
