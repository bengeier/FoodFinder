{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and mom and sister. The first thing that we noticed is that the restaurant is 100% family run: mom and dad in the restaurant, son as the host and waiter. The service was fantastic, very friendly. There was one other table when we got there at 6:45, but quickly filled up. 
The boyfriend and I had the quail, lamb and chicken machawi, and my mom and sister had the kebab, shish taouk and filet mignon machawi. We also had the chickpea soup and pita. The food was excellent: the lamb was flavourful and juicy, the quail was grilled expertly and the chicken was tender and well spiced. The plates also came with fatoush salad,  and which was very fresh. 

It is also a BYOW, which is great, and as an added bonus, there was no corking fee. 

Excellent restaurant with terrific food and service. New favourite Lebanese restaurant."}
{"text":"C'était vraiment délicieux! Et le couple qui tient l'endroit était très cordial et soucieux de nous savoir satisfaits 
On a partagé les assiettes de mashawi fruits de mer et viandes, c'était frais, varié, plein de goût. Ayant été très déçue de La Sirène (autre resto libanais à Montréal) par le passé, j'ai été agréablement surprise de découvrir cette petite perle où je reviendrai bientôt avec plaisir. En plus, c'est un BYOB, ce que j'adore.
Mini critique: J'aurais personnellement cuit le boeuf un peu moins et assaisonné le hommous d'un petit peu plus de citron. 
Mais sinon MIAM!
Bref, je vous recommande Azar chaudement."}
{"text":"This little lebanese cuisine restaurant is a true gem! 

Order the Machawi platter which is composed of 3 different meat, rice, salad!! I personally like the shashlik!

Best of all, bring your own wine!

Service is wonderful! Azar and his family puts so much work and effort. The best!"}
{"text":"Really tasty, good quality Lebanese food. And BYOW. A little on the pricey side, ~$35 per person without alcohol, but we had a good night.

It's a family business, and they're all working together well. The man managing the store front was really friendly, and not in an annoying way like some places. It was nice.

However, certain aspects left something to be desired - a slight emptiness that I can't put my finger on. That said, that could be also just be my own bias, because I grew up in the Middle East, and am not used to this type of otherwise reasonably priced food being marketed as something exotic and expensive.

But if you want Lebanese with some nice wine, it's a good spot."}
