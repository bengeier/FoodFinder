{"text":"Tasty Kitchen has a modern feel to it with Chinese shows playing on their TVs. It is a Hong Kong-style cafe where you can order anything from condensed milk on toast to noodle soup to baked casseroles to hotpot dishes. They also have a large list of Hong Kong-style beverages of course.  I personally prefer other restaurants in the area, but my family likes to come here occasionally. I have been here about 4 times and it has always been decent.  Today was a different story. We arrived later than usual so we were there just before the afternoon rush. We were quickly seated and my mom enjoyed the free Chinese newspaper they offer now.   Along with our hot coffee and Horlick, we ordered a curry beef brisket and tendon that came with soup and rice, as well as a braised vermicelli with pickled vegetables and pork. The lady served the soup fairly quickly; however, I noticed a strand of hair sitting on top, lying over the side of the bowl. It looked a lot like her wavy hair... The main dishes were decent. The curry tastes like curry but it is not spicy at all, and the vermicelli was neither salty or oily but I did not mind that at all.  My mom left to do a quick grocery trip at BTrust while I sat there with my grandpa as we were finishing our drinks. After about 5 minutes, there was a crowd at the door but several other tables had opened up. My grandpa asked for the bill to get it out of the way so we could leave whenever we were ready to go. We gave them a nice tip, they took it away and as my grandpa told me aloud, \"Let's stay here for a few more minutes\", the lady came with her tablecloth and cleaning spray. I looked to the front and saw only 2 people standing there and I overheard their request for a table of 7. She started cleaning the table and told me softly, \"Thank you, watch your step on your way out\" (in Chinese) and the next thing I saw was another waitress placing 7 cups of tea in front of me and asked the 2 people to have a seat. Only 2 out of 7 people had arrived. Was there really a need to rush us out? Could my grandpa and I not have gotten a minute to get our takeout and newspaper together, and put our jackets on before they invited their next group of guests?  I was absolutely appalled by the way we were treated. My grandpa also had to use the washroom, so I ended up having to stand by the front door waiting for him because we were rudely kicked out of our table.  I would have given them only 1 star if their food is as horrible as their service. I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Given how popular this place is, I'm surprised that it doesn't have more reviews. Tasty Kitchen is a clean and simply decorated restaurant with Hong Kong movies showing on the four or two TVs placed around the walls. Customers here tend to be younger than the rest of Golden Square.  I had the Chef's Special pork ribs, which was one of the most delicious dishes I can remember having. The meat was as tender as butter and I loved the cartilage crunch. My guest did not like the sauce as much as I did, but she agreed that it was tasty overall.  The Tofu Seafood Chef's special was unique and I get the impression that the owner has fun creating interesting combinations. Unfortunately, I didn't think this dish tasted good, but someone else may feel differently.  I came here two times other times before this and the food was good both times, but I can't remember what I ordered.   Customer service was top notch, and better than what you'd expect at most Chinese restaurants.  This place is on the less expensive side.  Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant to everyone. I'd give it 5 stars all things considered."}
{"text":"I ordered a pork bun sandwich here and the bun was clearly STALE. It was soo hard, and the pork chop inside the bun was kind of burnt.  I told the server that the bun is really dry, and she said \"it is supposed to be baked till crispy\" . I understand it is supposed to be crispy , yet soft on the inside. HOWEVER, this was not the case!  The bun was hard inside and outside! it was so disgusting that I didn't finish it.   I was talking to a friend afterwards who worked here as a part-time server , and he said the owner don't really care too much about the sandwiches , so they lack in quality.   ALSO, my friend said not many order sandwiches so thats why it takes LONG to go through a bag of buns. THis explains why my bun is stale. Probably because they go through a bag of buns in a week? or bi-weekly?  The other cooked items are OKAY, not good, just okay. THe typical dishes that I can cook at home.   I am giving this place a low rating since the owner doesn't mind serving customers with stale bread. This shows me the owner is just opening up a restaurant for profit, not to serve quality food...so they just serve whatever and get their money"}
{"text":"No free ice tea... The waitress was completely clueless about the offer.. wasted my data and battery for checking in.."}
{"text":"The place is simple and suitable for a quick hang out with friends. I remember the prices were decent and the reason I chose this restaurant was the vegan menu they had, which is not reduced to one dish. There was quite a choice. I chose rice with white cream mushroom sauce and it was delicious. Could have had a bit more of a kick to it, but I was happy."}
{"text":"Decent place for Hong Kong cafe style good and middle afternoon tea.  Food portion is a little small but the drinks appear bigger than most places"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I feel extremely unsatisfied. I found a piece of plastic in my eggs halfway through my meal. I brought this to the attention of the manager and she said she would replace it and took away my plate which still had my toast and bacon on it. Another dish came a few minutes later with just an egg.  What happened to my toast and bacon?? I asked for an additional slice of toast to go with the egg and she said breakfast is over, no more toast available. How is this possible?? How can you treat customers this way?? Worst customer experience ever. Don't waste your time coming here!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, fairly decent for the price and extensive menu for a cafe/diner type restaurant food. Decor is a bit upscale for casual food, even have several TVs on the wall and broadcasting asian shows. Thought the food was fine for something quick and tasty and my experience the first time was alright.  The second time I was APPALLED by the service that questioned whether I should come back. The first inexperienced female waitress took our order, and when we ordered #8,it turns out she got confused because there were two types of menus labelled #8, and instead of a hotpot, we ended up getting a sandwich (ended up eating half the sandwich because we were sort of confused but thought maybe this was some type of freebie included in the combo).   I then witnessed poor service to its finest. The table beside me asked for the bill, and before he wanted to ask another question the waitress turned directly away texting on her phone. The customer called after her but she kept walking, too absorbed in her texting.   I called the same waitress to get me the bill and she gave me this dumb look. The male behind the counter got the signal and proceeded to instruct the girl to get me the bill. It  turns out the first female waitress who took the order still charged us for the mistake she made of ordering the other #8 in the other menu (even when I explicitly pointed to #8 on the menu with the item I wanted). I think she should have waived this as a good gesture since it was clearly her mistake, but didn't want to make a big scene.  Would I return? Hesitant because I am completely deterred by the young girls they hired to waitress here."}
{"text":"Great little HK cake in Sauga.  Food: 4/5 A little slow but great afternoon tea menu. Service: 3/5 Efficient and serious. Environment: 4/5 Simple. Seating is spaced well. Washrooms: 4/5 Okay. Worth it?: 4/5 Good for a snack or afternoon tea.  Came here after a long hiking trip. We were a group of ate and service ended up moving another table who just sat down to make room for us. The family who was asked to move did so graciously so we lucked out.  The afternoon tea menu is quite good with a lot of options. Service does seem to want to rush to get your orders in.   Food portion is sized well. I had the spaghetti with meat sauce (to carb load after the hike). It was a simple dish and what you would expect from an HK cafe.   I would come back next time I'm in Sauga. There are not many HK cafes around and this one is a great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"The restaurant was about 80% full for a weeknight dinner. There were four tvs, two on each wall, playing HK dramas.   We ordered a Stewed Buddha's delight and lotus root with fermented red beancurd sauce in pot and the beef & eggplant in spicy sauce on sizzling plate. Both come with rice, soup of the day and coffee or tea for $9.25. The rice was cooked perfectly. The soup was a little salty, but they do give some pork and chicken feet with the soup which was good. I was impressed with the vegetarian pot. There were lots of mushrooms, fungi, bamboo shoots, and the lotus root was also very crunchy! The dish was also full of beancurd paste flavour.   Many of the other tables ordered a hot pot, which comes with iced lemon tea. When you check into Tasty Kitchen, it says you get a free iced lemon tea, but when I asked them, the waitress said that I wasn't signed into the correct location (which I was), but then someone else came and told me that they don't have that anymore. So keep that in mind!  This is a pretty decent place for an HK style cafe if you're in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Came here today to try the chicken pot. The chicken pot was very flavourful and juicey. I think they use free run chicken. This dish did NOT come with rice so make sure to order a bowl of rice because it is salty.   When I ordered the chicken pot I had no idea how much it was worth because I can't read Chinese and I just pointed at a picture.  So as soon as the bill came it startled me because it was worth $35.. which was really pricey.  I also ordered a Tomato porkchop spaghetti that was $7 and came with a drink. Nothing special about this dish.   With just 2 items, the bill came to $55  which was very expensive for what you are getting at a HK style cafe.    Overall I would recommend the chicken pot just to try it out because it was certainly tasty."}
{"text":"For Mississauga, I was very disappointed with the food here.  The Beef Chow Fun was okay and a bit greasy.  I ordered a chicken on a hot plate dish that was highly recommended, and it was not flavored well.  Everything we ordered was not flavored well and needed some salt.  The price is decent and it's open pretty late."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good - I was pleasantly surprised at the selection here. They have weekday specials where every day of the week they offer 5 different dishes at a cheaper price.   We also had a delicious hot pot and my usual order of baked spaghetti (but with ox tongue this time around). The food is on par with a few other HK cafes around the area, but I still like the spaghetti sauce at Pheonix better, but in terms of all the other dishes, this place has some winners. The hot pot dish was fantastic and it looked like the hakka fried noodles was a winner around the restaurant.   Note that the yelp check-in offer of a free drink will not be accepted here - they say they've tried to remove it from the yelp app several times but have not had any response from yelp? Just a warning for those trying to redeem."}
{"text":"A nice little restaurant although not much different from the ones surrounding it in the plaza. I like the HK cafe style feel to it, the fact I don't have to go down to Markham to get authentic HK cafe -style food. They have TVs showing Chinese shows and sometimes sports, but obviously I don't come here for that; it's the food that sticks out.   The wait times vary depending on what you order. Most of the time I would order a baked rice or pasta dish and it would take around 20 minutes, sometimes more due to the lack of serving staff. To some it would be an issue but for me, because I liked the food every time I came, not to mention the prices (about 7-10 dollars) and portion sizes, that a slightly longer wait doesn't me.  Something they could work on is a bit of charm from the staff. I always notice them working hard with many tables to tend to because the times I went they were short on staff but really, it isn't a big deal if the food is great."}
{"text":"Great for small snacks and tea, entrees are disappointing, but affordable.  The food is so under subpar, the food is blander then eatting at an elderly home. The price you pay reflects on the quality of dish.  My steak with spaghetti is just spaghetti noodles slapped on with sauce and a thin steak. No garnish or care.  My friends spaghetti was even worse, curry chicken spaghetti had color but was completely tasteless, not even a hint of a flavour sadly..  The tea was not bad, I enjoyed the soup and bread very much. However the kitchen work needs major improvement.   I'd advise the kitchen to work to shorten the lengthy menu which is WAYYY to extensive, it even confuses the reader.   I'm not sure I'll come back but perhaps for some coffee and small snack would be a good location for."}
{"text":"Well, I think I know why there aren't many reviews on this place.  Most people only write about places that are really exceptional or really terrible and this place is neither.  It is average and a safe bet.  Had the baked Portuguese chicken with spaghetti and it was only ok. I'll have to admit though that the service is very good for a Chinese restaurant with very quick service.  Would visit again, but not somewhere I would take a date."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of HK cafe style food and this is my favorite place to get my fill in Mississauga.  I highly recommend their deep fried chicken leg with spaghetti and a choice of sauce. Aside from tasting great, it is portioned generously. The size of their chicken legs are huge! You also get a drink on the side. I'm a sucker for a cup of hot HK style milk tea, so that's my usual get. The best part is that all this costs under 10 dollars! One word I would describe this restaurant. VALUE!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to place for late night eats.  A lot of places in Mississauga aren't open late, so I always end up coming here with friends.  Their food is similar to a Hong Kong cafe style.  Which is something I personally really love.  I like how they have specials which come with a drink for free.  I always get the Hot/Cold HK Milk Tea!  Their Deep Fried Chicken Leg is really good!  It does take 15 minutes to make, so order this when you aren't in a rush.  The only thing I'd say is a down fall is that they don't take credit or debit (only cash).  A bunch of times I wanted to come eat here, but someone in our group didn't have cash, so we went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am definitely a super fan for HK food especially since I don't live in Markham, I would say this is one of the very few places in sauga to have it. The milk tea is consistent and so is my all-time fav \"yin yang\" (mixed milk tea and coffee).  Tasty always makes milk tea fresh and it is super smooth...reminds me  of HK! They have lunch specials through out the week as well as dinner specials. I like their Chinese hot pot as they have various choices and it comes with a drink and soup. They also have a very popular deep fried Chicken leg combo that a lot of people order. It is very filling since the Chicken leg is massive! Tasty serves breakfast on weekends which unfortunately I don't often get to eat.. But the odd times that I have had it..it reminds of HK...reminiscing of the yummy goodness back home..  I personally enjoy Tasty and I would say to give it a try if you like hk-style food!!"}
{"text":"Arriving at Tasty Kitchen, nostalgic memories of eating at a cafe in Hong Kong filled my head. The décor.... the smell... reminiscing the great times. After my moment of remembrance, we were seated at our table. The waitress handed out the menus and gave us time to decide. At first glance, the atmosphere is welcoming. The free offer of the lemon iced tea offered on the Yelp app for checking into this restaurant is not accepted. :(  We ordered the spaghetti bolognese and the chicken ho fan in soup. Both came quickly and steaming hot.  The spaghetti bolognese was full of flavour. The sauce was watery but the noodles was cooked well. The chicken ho fan in soup tasted average. The noodles were very oily and the soup was bland.   The service was poor and was not attentive when we ordered our food. The decor is clean and has a pink colour design.   Tasty Kitchen is an average restaurant with decent food. Despite the flaws, I recommend this restaurant for a quick dinner. The entire review is written on Andriod phone. Update: Edited the review, fixed format structure, grammatical errors, changing sentences that does not best describe my experience."}
{"text":"Being a Sauga local, I always come here for a quick bite with my mom.  Reasonably price combo serve with drink and soup on most dishes.  Average $10 per person & you can't go wrong with the hot pot dishes!  I get it every time :)"}
{"text":"The only reason why this even marginally gets a 2 star is because the only thing 'good' is their deep fried chicken leg which is large. In the past, they used to couple that with some broccoli and carrots. Now they've completely removed that. Price range was about $8 for this meal, and you get a drink with that. Their milk tea/coffee is good however.  Other than that, all other meals they serve during lunch time is never satisfying and sometimes the portions are completely out of whack for the price. There was a time when I ordered their baby spare ribs for $8, and they gave us 2 or generously 3, baby ribs. The sauce covered the surface area of the plate more than anything else - I was very hungry after still and I was outraged that they even charged $8 for a \"lunch\" that I wouldn't even call a lunch but rather a snack.  The only reason why I bother coming here is cause my parents seldom like it as it is one of the better Hong Kong style cafes in Mississauga. If we had the portion of Hong Kong style cafes in Markham come over to Mississauga, this place would effectively be out of business or would suffer a good portion of their customers in my opinion.  There are many better options out there and unfortunately if you are going to cut down on your meal portions but increase the price with no reasonable justifications for the customer, it really does frustrate the customers."}
{"text":"I love coming to Tasty Kitchen for a quick lunch during the work week and everything is reasonably priced at around $10, which also comes with a free drink and/or soup.   Having been to Tasty Kitchen multiple times, I think my favourite dish is their hot casserole bowls. I've tried the Chicken & Chestnut bowl and the Curry bowl and both tasted great. For roughly $8,50 each, you get complimentary rice on the side, a bowl of traditional Chinese soup, and a beverage of your choice (have to pay extra if you want it to be cold). It is well worth the price and I had to pack some of it because the portion was pretty generous for a lunch.   The menu also has other types of dishes available, such as noodles, fried rice, and stand-alone dishes for large groups and for dinner. I think they are known for their hot pot chicken made with free-run chicken, which is cooked on the stove top at your table.  The service was quite lacking, however. During my experience at lunch, it was very difficult to flag down a server, because there were 3 people there running the restaurant and they were always on the go busy serving the other customers. It was definitely easier to get their attention if you speak Cantonese."}
{"text":"There aren't many selections of Chinese \"tea restaurants\" in Mississauga. This is one of the better ones in terms of pricing and quality of food. The portions seem to have decreased over time but my most recommended dish is their Deep fried chicken leg with black pepper sauce. Service is as expected compared to other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"First visit here. A little disappointed that the check in bonus was not honoured. It's a small thing ie only iced tea but it's the principle...  Food was just ok. I had the ox tongue with black pepper sauce and noodles. The ox tongue slices were very thin and the pepper sauce was barely pepperish.  The decor was cool with the back lit LEDs and free wifi was a bonus in a Chinese rest.  Will I repeat? I might give it another shot. Will report back then."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for lunch and both of us ended up with a stomach ache followed by many unfortunate visits to the washroom. (This was the only meal we had). We got an eggplant and pork rib pot and a fish and corn cream sauce spaghetti dish and two milk teas (hot and cold)."}
{"text":"Came by again with a huge group of people for lunch on Sunday (there was about 14 people) and it wasn't busy for us to be seated together. I know from our group, it's a love hate feel for this restaurant but decided to come here because we knew it was big enough to hold all of us.   My boyfriend recommended the deep chicken leg with spaghetti and literally raves about how good it is. I didn't have a good experience with my last baked spaghetti dish so I'll get something that he says is \"really good\". Portions are big like I said before, and the chicken thigh is deep fried and the skin is super crispy. The spaghetti comes plain with the sauce on the side. You have a few options to choose from. I chose the garlic which imo isn't garlicy enough. Think it needed more. It's basically like.. an Asian style gravy with garlic pieces and it's on the sweet end. I poured it in my spaghetti and dipped my chicken in the sauce bowl. Btw, if u ask for my sauce.. they will charge you $1.   This was a combo meal so I got a coffee milk tea. It wasn't that bad. The coffee has a strong after taste which is good and it's a lot creamier then I expected.   Generally my dish this time was good. A LOT better then what I had before. Service, could have been better. There was this one younger gentleman that was giving us the dishes very aggressively - imagine if he just dropped the plate from 2cm above quickly. The drop was loud.   Btw this dish reminds me of Oasis! Good old karaoke days where they had a dish like this too. I remember that being really good. Ah nostalgia."}
