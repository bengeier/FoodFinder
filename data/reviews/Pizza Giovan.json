{"text":"Not a bad place to go if you want cheap and easy pizza. A little bit more cheese and grease than I would usually want, but the price is right."}
{"text":"Got exactly what I was expecting. I wanted (needed??) greasy, cheesy pizza. And that is exactly what I got. Four stars for meeting expectations.   Don't bother with the fries. They are truly awful."}
{"text":"Solid three-star pizza.  I got delivery; took 30 minutes, no extra charge.  A bit greasy and heavy, tons of chewey mozza-cheesefood-type product.  Average crust and toppings.  rational-sounding bilingual phone guy.  Two mediums and drinks for $20.  Exactly what it should be."}
{"text":"Typical 2-for-1 Slices. Better Delivery.  Been grabbing slices here for probably as long as it's been open, and what you should know is that the quality fluctuates according to time of day of the week. The slices are passable during the daytime, but at their best on a weekend night when the Giovan is looking to catch the bar crowd and everything is freshly made.  The overall quality of all their pizzas, however, is much better when delivered. It must have something to do with cooking time ¯\_(?)_/¯.  Oh, and the fries are terrible.  In any case, not worth going out of your way for, but worth a stop-in if you're in the neighbourhood and looking for some post-drinks, greasy eats."}
{"text":"From the outside, expectations fleet.  However, the pizza (I ordered one fresh so don't quote me on the slice quality) was better than I thought.  The service wasn't bad. I might have given it 4 stars if they took debit, but instead, it's cash only and they have their own ATM in the store, which makes me insane.  It's not 1999 yo!  The best part of the experience was watching two obese dudes get a massive pizza in store, coating it in mayo and then having the most inane French/English conversation with their mouths full for the whole time I went there.  As I was leaving, I noted both of their faces were covered in mayo and pizza.  Rad!"}
{"text":"Perfect crust to cheese ratio. A nice chewy and fluffy texture to the crust. Just the right amount of crisp. Tons of vegetarian options including vegetarian Hawaiian. There pineapple pizza is my favourite in the whole world. I definitely make sure to go to pizza Giovans every time I go to Montreal. Honestly ignore the bad reviews this place is the bomb, only downfall is the atmosphere of dining in so get it to go or for delivery."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, great chicken wings, pretty average pizza. It'll do the job if you're hungry."}
{"text":"The best pizza slices on St Laurent after a night out. Make sure to ask for it properly heated up/let them take their time (if it's for a full sized takeout). Super friendly guys, good prices."}
{"text":"I got a slice here after attending a concert in Montreal, so I was hungry and went to the first pizza place I saw (usually I check reviews thoroughly before deciding on a place)! It was about $3.50 for a slice, it wasn't too thin or thick, had enough sauce, and toppings as well (I tried deluxe). There could be more pepperoni though. The crust was not too hard and it was actually a pretty solid slice of pizza!"}
{"text":"I live one block from this place. One night I was craving pizza and I wanted to order from a famous chain, but my roommate and her boyfriend wanted to order from there (for pickup). I gave it a go. We ordered a jumbo deluxe.   It was huge. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of topping there were. The crust was thick and light. The biggest surprise was the fresh tomatoes on top of the pizza, which were still juicy and not dry.   This week, my roommate and I wanted to order a medium deluxe and on the phone, the guy told us that the special was a large for $10 (taxes included). Great bargain! And it is much cheaper that the famous chain nearby."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza in a pizza-challenged city.  I grew up in Hamilton...a very Italian city where good pizza is more common than Tim Hortons.  But be careful.  Giovan bills itself as a 2 for 1 pizza place.  It isn't.  They charge about $25 for a pizza, so they charge you for two but tell you it's 2 for 1."}
{"text":"Came here for the third time in the past 2 days- the pizza is mediocre, but not awful. This time, I decided to just get 3 slices of plain pizza.. thinking it would be around 10-12 AT MOST, the rude man at the register mumbled a price. I handed him a 20 & he gives me back a dollar and some change. 18 something for 3 slices of pizza?? will not be coming back. pizza is NOT worth $18."}
