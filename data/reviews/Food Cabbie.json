{"text":"We drove 9.5 hours to Toronto and this place was on my list to grab a bite to eat. We stopped here after a little exploring and it was definitely well worth it.  We got grilled cheese, my boyfriend got a \"dawg\" and we split home fries.  The grilled cheese was perfect, especially with the parmesan mixed with the american.  The owner was so nice, we talked to him for a few minutes once he realized we were from New York.  Apparently Toronto is trying to get rid of food carts, but this one should definitely stay!"}

These guys are awesome. I was so surprised at the size and quality of the Breakfast Burrito. Tons of chorizo, two eggs, potatoes, beans and the list goes on. 

The fries are fresh with skins remaining and are super reasonable as an additional $3 buck side. $10 dollars for all this with tax in and with a 1.5 LB Burrito, a killer score!

They take a bit longer to make their food but that's because they don't skimp out. Next time to you see them, you gotta try some of the authentic mexican flavours.

{"text":"Location: Everywhere?
Price: $$
Service: Okay

Over the pass weekend they were at the Canadian Baking and Sweets show. I heard their food is pretty legit so I had to try it out for myself and I wasn't disappointed. The service is okay and the line was long- so you'll wait 10-15mins for your food. 

I tried the DiNics with fries and gravy. The DiNics is their pull pork sandwich with onion and spinach. It was pretty good; I wish they had it in flat bread because I thought the bread kind of over powered the stuffing. Other than that the DiNics was delicious. Their fries were okay but it was their gravy that made the fries amazing. The gravy was just right and complimented the fries.. I probably wouldn't enjoy the fries as much if I didn't add the gravy to it.

Verdict: A must try!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of food on wheels, but this one is different.

You gotta love the owner.
He is from California and will provide you with a great selection of buns and different ways to prepare their american burger.

Secret menu items and daily specials keep the menu interesting.

Very reasonable prices.
I will keep updating this review over time while munching my way through the menu list..."}
{"text":"I eat at food trucks all the time in NYC. This is more of a food cart since it has to be towed around, but I won't hold that against it. So far, I've been here twice and had the daily specials, but one of these days I'll try the regular menu items. 

Chicago Italian beef sandwich, double dipped. Usually, this means it's a soaking mess, but this was a manageable mess so I don't think it was fully immersed in jus. The beef clearly did taste of Italian style seasoning and the sandwich was filling and good.

Mexican steak torta. This was a misfire. It's tasty, but could've benefited from some avocado to cut the hot sauce. This sandwich was more of a mess than the Italian beef . Tasty, but one note due to the spiciness. 

I'll definitely be back because the prices are reasonable and I support food trucks even if the city thinks enforcing pointless bylaws is of more interest to the public good than recognizing an opportunity to help nurture a nascent industry, especially after the disastrous ala cart program."}
