{"text":"Decent pizza for the price.  Probably great for kids party to feed a lot of people without spending a lot of money."}
{"text":"This is a great place to order your pizza for parties. All my guests loved the pizza especially the supreme and Hawaiian. Their buffalo wings is awesome. I really thank the nice and respectful staffs too. You guys deserve 10 stars."}
{"text":"Been here twice already and the staff is very welcoming. They accommodated my two younger kids very well and it is extremely clean in here. The gentleman went through the entire menu with me which was very hospitable and the selection wasn't overwhelming. Pizza came out hot and perfectly cooked. FREE WIFI which is a plus and the large windows to a clean surrounding area was great as well. Pizza and wings are a must try! I'm so glad I love close! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"My kids love the pizza from this place and the staff is always friendly and happy. Glad to support Local!"}
{"text":"Really good wholesome pizza with fresh veggies.  The cherry tomatoes actually add a better taste and don't make the pie soggy. Delizioso!"}
{"text":"These pizzas are to die for! This place just opened up about 2 days and I have fallen in love with the place!!!! If you want to find a pizza place that is close to you and that is really good, you should come here!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite busy weeknight pizza place. Their crust is perfect, not too thick not too thin...sauce is amazing. Not to mention they have the best margarita pizza in town! Amazing prices, fast service and they have something everyone in my family loves! Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for the price ! Always get it atleast once a month, sometimes more. Service is always polite and friendly too."}
{"text":"Picked up pizza for dinner in the middle of my shift. Was hesitant about getting hot dog on my pizza but I'm glad I tried it! I ordered the Buffalo hot dog pizza. The service was fast and staff was very friendly. Prices are more than fair as well. I would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Low quality pizza and wings. It doesn't look like the same pizza on their profile or website. It's slightly better than Little Caesar's pizza. Pizza usually tastes better the next day but this is an exception to the rule. We tried their boneless wings too. They were the same quality as the frozen wings at the supermarket. Delivery was done in a decent time. We won't be ordering from here again. There is much better available in the area."}
{"text":"Consistently great!! We love this place! The pizza is always delicious. It will not disappoint! They offer a wide variety of unique toppings but pepperoni with extra cheese is our standing order. The service is outstanding, a great group of guys who are helpful and very friendly! To top off this little gem, the price! It's a really great value!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! ! Staff is friendly and quick and the owner Kamran is the best! ! Way better than the Little Caesar's down the road,  I'll be going here instead from now on! !!!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed when Venezia's Pizza moved to Gilbert a few years ago and this spot lay dormant, until Buon Padre opened shop. We're so glad it did. This is your classic mom'n'pop (okay mostly pop) place and the owner is awesome. We've had several pizzas and some wings and it's been top-notch. If you live in the area this place is well worth a visit. Or even if you live in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Personaly I got the hawian easily the best pizza I ever had there is so much to love about this place the empolyes were extremely friendly and down to earth . Back to the pizza the crust on that thing is *kiss* perfect the sauce is the best 10/5 would eat there again!"}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! The customer service, the personalized touches, the fresh salad and items on pizza.  I ordered from this place based on reviews, I called three days ahead to deliver for my upcoming meeting with customers.  They arrived ON time, the food was fresh, the pizza was hot and the price was REASONABLE! I had left overs and a crowd following me to the kitchen for a sample.  Each and every person was amazed on how good the food was.  I love to be able to order to a local restaurant, and you can plan on all my business in the future.  This is a MUST!

{"text":"First visit. Opened two days ago. We ordered pizza and salad for take-out. Restaurant has been recently remodeled. Clean and welcoming atmosphere. Counter service was friendly and efficient. Our food was ready in about 10 minutes. Our \"Meatza\" Pizza was tasty with ample amounts of cheese and meat: pepperoni, beef, ham, sausage and bacon. Crust was thin and crisp, perhaps a bit too salty for my preference, but still good. Greek salad was good too - loaded with olives, feta cheese, tomatoes and cucumbers. Looking forward to second visit!

Updated to five stars, since Buon Padre is now our go-to Pizza and Wing place!"}
{"text":"Totally recommend this place if you're in the mood for quality pizza! I agree with all the great reviews. The staff is super friendly, the restaurant is clean and the pizzas we got tasted delicious. 
The staff will ask you if you need anything else, how your food is which I think is awesome.
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not any better than little Caesar's or dominoes. It's cheap, but not worth it to me.  Don't order on yelp because you might accidentally Place an order while it freezes up. I ended up with 2 medium pizzas I really didn't want and when I realized it, I called the business owner and he just said they were already made and wasn't willing to can el my order. He told me to call yelp. Instead of dealing with the hassle, I just decided to pick them up since it's pretty cheap and how bad can it be? Well, after trying it,  it still wasn't worth even the price. I won't be returning or recommending to anyone. Even barros and Costco have way better pizza and they're cheap too"}
{"text":"I am very happy that I found this pizza place. It had very friendly staffs and they were super nice and helpful. It had the best pizza crust I ever had. The topics were balanced and everything was delicious. The best part was that you paid less for a pizza that had a much higher value.
I will come here anytime I need a good pizza.
Thank you."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great prices. We had a barbecue chicken pizza and a pepperoni, black olives, and hot dog pizza. Both were really good. The hot dog pizza brought me back to when I was a kid - I don't know why it's not a more popular topping at pizza places. 

Also had some hot boneless wings, which were very good as well.

This place has only been here a few weeks, and I definitely see myself coming back many times."}
{"text":"I wish the location was bigger, that the staff made me feel more welcome, and that the pizza was tastier."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great prices! A good local pizza place with fast service if you live in the Pecos/McQueen area. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time based on the good reviews. The pizza was not very good. Digornio pizza or frozen pizzas are way better than this pizza. No flavor and the pizza was flimsy and soggy like. We also got boneless wings thinking they would be good... nope! The wings tasted like frozen ones that were warmed up in the microwave. Will not be going back here again! This place should be embarrassed by the \"food\" they serve!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. I got their veggie breakfast pizza and it was the best I've ever had. Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great quality pizza. This place is definitely different in a good way from other pizza places. Prices are very reasonable. Customer service was great. The place looks reasonable and somewhat elegant a pizza place. Definitely go there again. Thank you"}
{"text":"Great people and service. The owner is very personable. The pizza is delicious and not very cheesy. Definitely recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"What is going on here?  This place has great pizza and should be packed!  Okay, it is not gourmet wood fired or coal fired pizza, blah blah blah.  It is great & affordable extremely tasty pizza.  

It is a little hard to find, but worth the venture.  Buon Padre has occupied the old Venezias location at Pecos & McQueen (Behind McDonalds, next to KTR).

Please support these awesome small business owners!  I don't want to lose my new pizza fix!

Sorry to all my other regular take-out joints, Buon Padre is my new Go-to!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Buon Padre in the old location for Venezia. The service is top notch, very friendly, and accommodating. The prices are fair and the pizza is very fresh and delicious. Toppings are plenty on our supreme pizza. We ordered a Caesar salad first it was fresh, no frills but otherwise was good. We ordered some bone-in hot wings that are baked they were piping hot and cooked just right. They were flavorful and juicy like windows should be. The pizza came out just as hot and was great. The dough is perfect and light. The vegetables were fresh and crispy. The establishment is clean and well lit.  One of the better pizza places I have visited over the past year in this part of the east valley. I highly recommend this family run business."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza is super yummy. The service was quick, friendly and efficient. The restaurant itself is noticeably clean. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try the local pizza place since we live near here.  We ordered the veggie pizza & it was delicious!  I can't wait to try the Hawaiian and the hot dog pizzas.  The sauce & crust were delicious.  There were plenty of fresh veggie toppings & lots of cheese.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered this place to go. It was so delicious!!! 
It was made perfect! 
It will definitely be back!!
Yummmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Came highly recommended from friends who eat here a lot. It truly is  great pizza."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! The pizza and salads are great and the customer service is exceptional! Everything is so tasty at an awesome price too!"}
{"text":"I tried this place tonight as I have been on a buy local binge. I'm trying to avoid chains when possible. 

I had the Hawaiian pizza and it was pretty delicious. They were very cordial on the phone and even more in person. I will return again sometime to try something else."}
{"text":"Nice owner , soggy crust . Good toppings . Inexpensive. Loud kids . Limited menu . Very spartan interior . Barebones edible pizza . Will return and ask for well done crust. Had to ask for a basic combo as it's not listed but owner did ."}
{"text":"The most wonderful family-owned type pizza place around! The workers are so extremely nice and attentive. The food is super good quality and is definitely equal to the price you pay for it. I usually get the meat-loaded pizza, boneless buffalo wings, and a small green salad and they all always turn out wonderful! Carry out time is never too long and it's also a comfortable atmosphere to sit inside as well. I often find myself craving this pizza lol, I have recommended this place any times!"}
{"text":"Just found this gem. Great pizza for cheap. Definitely better than any chain and just as friendly on the pockets."}
{"text":"Great value, the pizza taste very good for the price: you can get alot of food, for a low price"}
{"text":"this place is bomb!!!!! i would not go anywhere else i am leaving this review while sitting next to my pizza to go and it is like a tease!!!! come here nowwww!! the owners will look out for you and are very nice!!! one of a kind!!!"}
{"text":"Small place that Siri recommended when asked, \"Best wings near me\", now my boyfriend is the one with the iPhone, I don't like nor trust his mobile girlfriend but I will admit, she did not disappoint.
The food, wings especially, were delicious and served hot, just like our pizza. The staff was so nice, checked on us that right amount where you don't feel neither smothered nor outcasted.
Definitely will return before the next National Chicken Wing Day."}
{"text":"We recently moved to this area, and this is our favorite local pizza! I always get the 3 cheese bread and buffalo chicken pizza! They always have it ready within 15 minutes, I highly recommend this location to everyone!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what everyone is ordering but my experience was maybe mediocre.  We had a pepperoni pizza and left feeling it was better than the $5 pizza down the street but doesn't  quite hit the spot that other pizza places satisfy. 

I'll go back and try something different but only because so many rave about this place."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  We ordered the supreme pizza and it was delicious,  fresh toppings the cheese was great and the sauce just perfect!  Cute place and great pricing!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed our first Buon Padre Pizza.  Very fresh and delicious! Price is perfect!  Lots of parking and easily accessible! Been waiting for a new pizza place in this location. Thanks Padre!! We'll be back:)"}
{"text":"Great reasonably priced pizza and other food items! Local owned shop, close to home. The store is clean and inviting. Easy to order and easy to pick up."}
{"text":"Good, simple pizza. Great prices. Hot dog pizza sounds weird but is really tasty! Friendly service, too!"}
{"text":"My nephew and I came here for lunch around noon on a Monday, definitely not too busy and we were welcomed by the young man behind the counter. Very nice, explained the lunch specials to us, and we got two lunch specials and ate in.

As I took my first bite, as you can see I couldn't even wait to take the picture first, you can definitely taste a difference from other places like domino's, etc. The sauce was really good and the cheese was fantastic. It was cooked just right, and didn't taste greasy. I never eat my crust either, and I ate that too.

Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The first time my boyfriend and I had their pizza was when we ordered delivery on a whim. It was late and this place is literally down the street from us. I normally don't go to local chains from not-so-great experiences in the past but this is our go-to pizza place now! BP has been nothing short of fresh and delicious. The pizza isn't too greasy either. You get way more what you pay here! I love that they don't skimp on quality with their inexpensive prices. Thank you BP for stepping up the standards for fast and great food :)"}
{"text":"I Love my Pizza!!! The pizza was delicious! I was greeted when I walked in the door, served a hot pizza... quickly. Ordered how I like it! It was a nice clean place which is always appealing to me.  I have high standards for my pizza and I will be back! Thank you Nathan for making a pizza I enjoyed and being so kind. Also, great prices! A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend, this is my new favorite pizza, anywhere in this area! Ever since I heard about this place, it's the only pizza place I've gone since. I always order the Supreme, and it tastes perfect and made the exact same way every time! Many times you go to certain restaurants, the food isn't made consistently the same way each time you go, and that's not fair to the customer. The prices here are very reasonable, and the customer service is great every time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now in the past 2 weeks. The first time we came to dine in because it was a new business and we wanted to see what the inside was like. We ordered a buffalo chicken pizza. The price was perfect. The owner (I'm assuming) brought the pizza out to us personally and gave me ranch, free of charge. Once we took a couple of bites another employee came to check on us. The second time we ordered and picked up for some friends that were coming over. We got the buffalo chicken and pepperoni pizza and we won everyone over with this. I love this place! The service was amazing, the pizza was amazing, and the employees were amazing. It's also conveniently close to my house. :)"}
{"text":"Tried BPP for the first time tonight. I'm giving it 5 stars overall, largely because it's an insanely good value - $7.53 all-in for a 14\" 1-item (pep in my case) pizza is a pretty darn good deal. The pizza itself was competent if not outstanding - plenty of cheese, tasty if unmemorable crust & sauce. But at that price, it's a fantastic value and for a competent-if-not-outstanding pie. If you need to feed a large family or group, this is a great value. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I can't even explain how amazing the pizza is here. Everyone in my family loved it! .
 Also, the ambiance was nice and the  staff was awesome. Will definitely be back.
Great price, great price, great price
Great customer service
Tide n clean 
So delicious"}
{"text":"Tried this place out with the grand kids for the first time today had a pepperoni pizza and a margarita pizza both were very good everyone loved it, Good friendly service pizza at a fair price We will go back!"}
