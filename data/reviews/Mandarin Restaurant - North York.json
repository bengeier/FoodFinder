{"text":"This restaurant is one of the worst restaurant I've ever ate at.... 
The food is not good as I expected. The waiters aren't that nice either. They spoke way too fast as if they are in a rush. The only good thing about it is that they have a variety of drinks and that's about it .-. 
I don't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Located in the Industrial Heartland of North York, this location provides the variety you crave.
 My mid-week arrival with the Birthday Girl was delightful...my strategy is to start light and pick out a huge prime rib bone to gnaw on for the night. 
No surprises here...I have been to ALL their locations..attentive service...
clean utensils....my date went well !"}
{"text":"Make sure you have a reservation, and come 10 minutes prior to your requested time so you get a table a.s.a.p as this place is often crowded around the dinner time rush. With that said, the food is great, and depending on what day you go, there is always added specials to satisfy your taste buds. Drinks are extra cost, but they do have a variety of drinks to choose from. The place is kept clean, even though there are a few chairs and tables that could be replaced as the overuse of them can be seen and felt when sat on or touched. With that said, one of the better locations. Been here 5 or 6 times, and will come again ( with reservations ) when I am in the area"}
{"text":"Every Mandarin is identical, and this one is no different. The food is passable but bland and uninspired. Their fish is horribly cooked - dry and tough - and their holiday specials (e.g., lobster thermidor) are poorly done and not worth the hefty surcharge. There are many better buffets in the GTA so I suggest you go there. 

Other issues: their seating is painfully slow. Each hostess takes one guest at a time, so even when there are dozens of empty tables you could wait 10 minutes to sit if a few people are in front. Learn from the big buffets and seat multiple parties at once.

On the plus side, Mandarin is clean."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Chinese takeaway I've had in any country in the world.

Overcooked, old wonton. Over-sweet, tough spare ribs. Very sad looking prawns in way too much garlic (and I like garlic, but this dish could kill a vampire).

Perhaps good if you go for the buffet, but NEVER take away from this place as they'll just give you all the old stuff. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Mandarin Restaurant is not a chic place and you shouldn't expect more than that.  It's a very nice family restaurant with good value.  Some days are better than other for consistency of dishes, but the servers are cheerful and do want to make you a welcome guest.

The biggest concern about this location is the Management's mind-set.  For some very wrong reason, guests are required to wait upon arriving at the restaurant regardless of the availability of seating.  I arrived with my party (total of 4) at about 5:15pm and we were told it would be a 10minute wait before we were seated.  There were a few others seated in the waiting area, so we didn't think anything of it.  Upon being called and graciously seated, we noticed that there were perhaps a total of 20 other people in the entire restaurant... almost more servers than guests!  What the?  

Why did we have to wait to be seated when then were many empty seats and tables???   I asked the server this and was told \"Management wants customers to think we're busy\". What???  Yes, Tom the Manager seems to think customers would rather wait to be seated in a slow restaurant night rather than enjoy their meal quicker and get on with their evening.

If you're looking for a place you can have a quick buffet meal, think of another place... insulting me by making me wait to be seating in an empty restaurant is not usually what a buffet restaurant wants to happen... usually be seated, served and leave is the way so they can turn over and seat more people.

Avoid any nights or days when Tom is working, usually these nights are not the best for food consistency."}
{"text":"Zero happiness exists in this location and just outright rude service.
The managers treat you like you are bothering them if you make a request for more shrimp in a take out order even if you pay whatever they ask."}
{"text":"I loved the food when I first got there. By the end, everything seemed to taste the same. Maybe I shouldn't have went back to the buffet for my 6th serving."}
{"text":"I had a good lunch here. Like all buffets part of the Mandarin chain, it is clean and offers pretty good food."}
{"text":"Not my favorite Mandarin location, but Mandarin is absolutely the best of the Chinese buffets in Toronto.
Price is high but so is the quality, keeping in mind this is a buffet, and you should never take the last spoonful of anything from a nearly empty tray, and focus on the freshly-filled dishes. 
Some faves include the prime rib, crab legs (cold better than hot), spicy chicken, bbq pork ribs, wings, dimsum, fried fish w Tartar, scallop cutlets, the hot waffles with strawberries and whipped cream, the macaroons, and the creme brulee for dessert.
I find that if you want a big feast and to please a large group of people, Mandarin is the sort of place that some of your guests will find fancy and exciting, and those with more refined palates who don't, won't hate it. So it's always a safe bet.
As Chinese mega-buffets go, Mandarin is a good one."}
{"text":"Two stars are generally reserved for places that have pretty bad food and have good service. If a place has horrible food and bad service, that's a one star restaurant in my book.

With that said, the food here is just bad. But most buffets have bad food, especially with a name like Mandarin or Hong Kong or Chinese stuck in it somewhere. Avoid those places unless you don't mind cutting your life short by a few years, gaining a few pounds, and most likely getting diarrhea in the process. If you don't shit yourself after eating here, you will down the road and remember it's because you ate here.

Parking: Plenty
Price: Not worth it
Wait: Long just to get seated"}
{"text":"Love the new renovations! New management team at North York has improved everything!"}
{"text":"Finch location. Ordered barbecue spare ribs for take out around 3:00 p.m.  They don not have them on the lunch buffet, only dinner, so I specifically requested that they be made fresh. Got the order home a few minutes later only to find they were ice cold, dry and drowned in sauce.  Obviously they had been cooked the day before, taken from the fridge, put in a container and given to me for my take out order.  I called and spoke to the manager who gave me a credit but what he should have offered me was a complimentary dinner to compensate for the fact that I drove over there and was given day old food which was inedible."}
{"text":"Been to this location multiple times today was the most recent visit for me. I went on my lunch break with a friend. This location or mandarin in general would be perfectly described as quantity over quality.. The salads and sweets are pretty delicious but when it comes to entrees or main dishes most of what they offer is dry , blend , looks and tastes old. Service is average this would fairly sit on 3 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to three Mandarins, and this is so far is the best out of the three. The decor is much more toned down; I can't stand gaudy, over-the-top decor. Food is similar except for the creme brulee YUM! Service is more upbeat and happy, as well as efficient in clearing plates, topping off water glasses and taking pictures for their patrons. What surprised me was that they handed out pre-moistened, scented washcloths before AND after our meal. It's the little details that earn an extra star for this branch."}
{"text":"Ah mandarin, where you eat 5x the servings you normally would in a day and are full of regret by the end of your meal. 
Food is okay, rice is dry, sushi is subpar. Most of the cakes are really good, frozen yogurt is really good."}
{"text":"It's a nice family restaurant. The food choices are decent, the place is clean and well organized. Overall a very pleasant experience that I would recommend."}
{"text":"I feel that the Mandarin has it's good nights and it's bad ones. Sometimes the food is delicious and others like it died. I like their plum sauce and egg rolls, not so crazy on the spring rolls. Alot of times their sweet and sour sauce tastes too much like ketchup and the sauce is very running and not thick. The chicken balls can be good or very doughy...

Overall it is one of the better Chinese buffets but if you want great Chinese food I recommend going to a non-buffet restaurant where the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Well, when you've got teenaged boys around, (they're always hungry), and it's too hot to cook you go to a Buffet. I hadn't been to this location in some years. It was my favorite back then and I was not disappointed this time either. I tried some of everything. The prime rib was juicy and tender, the sushi was fresh and all of the Chinese fare was delicious. (wasn't crazy about the seaweed salad though...ugh). My only gripe is that even with a reservation we had to wait a while to be seated. But  that's not new. If you want to eat here best make that reservation. I have gone a couple of times just spur of the moment and couldn't get in."}
{"text":"I went to have lunch a month ago at Mandarin North York I always visit the Mandarin at Yonge and Eglinton however I found out that the one on NORTH YORK belongs to a different owner. 

I had two small plates of food and my regular meals usually are very healthy, however not sure what happened but after 4-5 hrs I got very sick & throw up 28 times and ending at the doctors, WORST EXPERIENCE ! 

I noticed that place is not as clean even washrooms or behind bar, AVOID TO GO THERE if you don't want to ending as sick as I was."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Mandarin restaurant was about 14 years ago at the Yonge and Eglinton location. I decided to come to this branch for good old times sake and because I didn't know they would differ. The service kind of lagged, since they did not take our empty plates on time and when I had no choice but to place my empty plate on the empty table next to us, they complained that I shouldn't do so. Well, where am I supposed to put my plate when you don't pick it up on time?
I only enjoyed the lobster legs and everything else was extremely mediocre. I can't recommend this place at all, since the quality is very low and the options are small.
It literally feels like going to an all you can eat Chinese take out at your local mall. If that's your thing then by all means come here. If not, don't waste your money and consume your high sugar, high glutamate dish with fattening low quality desert.
I only give this place a 2 star, since another waiter helped me teach how to get the meat out of the lobster leg. By the way, there's no proper lobster utensil to use at this place."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in 15 years. But now those back in the area I desperately wanted to try it again and it did not disappoint. The selection on the buffet is amazing and outstanding and the food is really good. The service is excellent the wait staff is friendly the manager came over to say hello and ask how things were great experience would highly recommend the place we're from New York but certainly would come here again."}
{"text":"Price: Expensive for what you pay (compared to other buffets)

Quality: 2/10. Lots of items were flavourless, had to add a ton of salt and pepper. Crab legs were not served on a weekend.

Decor: Outdated with random posters on the side wall. 

Service: Efficient and fast. Waiters kept refilling out water and taking our plates

Overall: I would not return due to the price and the limitation of foods."}
{"text":"Too many options, from pizza to seafood. Food is tasty, but depending on the day can be very crowded. We went on a Sunday and it was completely full. Not sure about the price because my husband's company paid for it."}
