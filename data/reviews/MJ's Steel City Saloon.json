{"text":"Solid neighborhood bar all around. We live super close so it is a go-to for drinks and quality bar food. They use all Mancini's for their hoagies, sandwiches and pizza dough. The Rachel is big and delicious, made with in-house rotisserie turkey on thick Mancini's marble rye. Great bartenders. Black and gold ambiance. This last visit would have been 5 stars except for two minor complaints- fries were limpish/soggy. (But fresh cut- so we ate them anyway:) And...inside it is sometimes oddly bright for a bar. Weird complaint I know but there are a LOT of lights and bright gold walls...dim the lights for 5 stars;) But again- they do a good job all around- I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great new bar.

I've been here twice so far, both times for lunch and drinks.

The food is great and you get a huge portion for the price. The prices are very reasonable as well. The food is not the typical quick bar food, they actually have a large kitchen and cook it well.

The drink selection and prices are also great. The have about 15 drafts and tons of bottles. Weekly specials and such also. (Pennsylvania games have specials).

The overall is huge and there is tons of seating. Both at the bar and booths/tables. 

We were talking to the bar tender (Bar staff is amazing) he stated that during the summer they will open the back up and it will have outdoor seating with an outdoor bar, fire-pits, corn-hole, etc.  Really looking forward to the summer at this place."}
{"text":"The black and yellow large bar of the old Steel City Saloon, with some West Allegheny charm added to the new MJ's Steel City Saloon creates a more family friendly establishment... as much as a pub can. 

The menu is small, but exactly what it should be. The hoagies are huge! I ordered the full 12\" chicken parm, and I could only finish half. It tasted great. I also recommend the Buffalo chicken balls.

There are now new booths for dining, more TV's, more space, and no smoking. 

Overall, I definitely recommend stopping by there for lunch during the workweek, a cold drink and a bite after work, or to catch a game on the projection screen and great gameday deals. I'll be back when I'm in the area. They could expand their beer selection in my opinion though."}
{"text":"The only good thing was the bartender/server was nice.  

The place was not even busy and all we ordered was a hot roast beef & hot turkey (both with fresh cut fries).  About 25 min later we finally get it.  We told them not to toast the bread (that's how its served per the menu).  They toasted it ever so slightly.  The beef gravy was so thick and dark that it looked like chocolate pudding.  The server apologized and said they were having problems with it.  So why would you serve it!!!  And the beef was actually cold!!  The turkey was warm, not super hot, gravy a little thick but not bad.  Asked for more turkey gravy because they only filled the bowl half way.  This time they must have microwaved it for several minutes because steam was coming from it.  

Anyhow the roast beef was sent back, taken off the bill and sorry but he was afraid to try anything else.  Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Triple Bypass has been scheduled!

I was pleasantly surprised with MJ's Steel City Saloon.  I have never heard of this hidden gem.    

This place is on Cliff Mine Rd - about 5 -7 mins from 376.  

A friend directed me to MJ's for a quick happy hour.    The bartenders were great.   I decided to order some food.  I looked at their menu - they have all the bar food options.   Most of us ordered burgers but one ordered the pizza and it looked very good as well.    I went with their specialty burger (when in Rome...) and ordered the BaconBurgerDog.   

The burger was as you would guess- A cheeseburger, split grilled hot dog, bacon, and deep fried onion petals.    It was awesome besides the tri-fecta of meat - the onion petals were the bomb (so much better than onion rings)!   I really enjoyed the flavors - my only problem was that I could not eat it all.

The place succeeded in my triple constraint - Friendly staff, Great Food / Drink, Great Prices.

Check it out.   Try a burger :-)"}
{"text":"Staff is great and friendly. Restaurant and outdoor seating is awesome only reason I gave it a 3 star review is food is average, not the greatest but not bad either. It's good bar food eating if that's what you're looking for. They have fantastic drink specials as well as daily food specials. It's a hidden gem away from the hustle bustle of Robinson township. Stop in ya won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped by to try the wings. After ordering a beer and requesting a menu, the bartender stopped over 28 minutes later asking if I would like another beer. Sure, about 10 minutes ago... And wings? Try 25 minutes.

In fairness, it was her first night as a bartender and NOBODY WAS HELPING HER OUT... So, ask yourself: what bar/restaurant/establishment throws a newbie to the wolves with nary a lifeline?  Easy answer: this place.

If you have hours to hang, maybe that's okay."}
{"text":"Humongous bar spot with many draught beer and bottled options: Fat Tire, Bell's Two-hearted, etc. Hungry? Don't pass up the food! I had the 1/2 lb gravy burger with curly fries. It is no joke. Very good!"}
{"text":"Italian Hoagie was awesome! Service a tad slow for Friday lunch crowd where she had to cover bar and tables. But she was nice and as quick as she could with all the customers."}
{"text":"Well apears to be a rather decent local tavern . Out here at the local car cruise . Well if you're just living out this way, stop by and check things out, probably really like it  !"}
{"text":"Tried the food  the Fish sandwich is to die for and the Pizza like nothing we have ever had before. Wonderful! And as always Shawn is one of the best bartenders I 
have ever seen this place is  just what Imperial needed"}
{"text":"Better than average bar food plus entire meals. We went on St. Patrick's Day for dinner and a couple green beers. Exceptionally nice and courteous staff. 
Seats at the bar and bar height tables as well as booths on the side away from noise. 
We will return."}
