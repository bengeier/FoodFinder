{"text":"I know St. Lawrence market is full of great food, but I never would've thought that tucked way in the back of the building I'd find something quite like Buster's Sea Cove.  Keep in mind though, this takeout shop isn't Rodney's or Oyster Boy, and I'm definitely not trying to convince you that it is. In fact, Buster's Sea Cove isn't even in the same boat. At Buster's, you won't find soft lighting, romantic ambience, or table-side service, but what you're pretty much guaranteed to find, is some killer seafood served up really, really quickly.  Fresh-made fish and chips are the staple in this place, but they've got so much more than that. Their huge menu has everything from crab cakes and clam strips to fried oysters and fish-topped salads. And their fish-type sandwiches, something that they happen to do really, really well, are outstanding. I'm not talking about your standard old fried-fish-on-a-bun here; Buster's rivals the best seafood takeout places with crab cake paninis and seared tuna melts sandwiches.  But don't overlook the fish and chips either. This little takeout stand easily delivers one of the best plates of the stuff in the city. They've got a few varieties of fish to choose from, and each of them is served up expertly battered and crispy. Each plate of fish and chips also comes with in-house made fries and a killer slaw.  Buster's also has a few other options you wouldn't expect from a takeout stand. Grilled swordfish, seafood bisque, rainbow trout, even octopus to name a few. It ain't fine dining by any means, but they truly do push the limits of what takeout is both in quality and selection.  Chances are though, once you get your food you'll be spending most of your time searching for a place to eat it. Busters only has 4 tables or so scattered around in front of the counter, but if those are full-and they probably will be-you're on your own. There's an exit close by to the Market's back patio and parking lot where most of Buster's customers end up, but trust me, if it's a nice day out, that'll fill up pretty quick too and you'll be left looking for a place to eat your by-then-getting-cold food.  Truth be told though, even if you're standing out back of the market among parked cars and alleyways, it won't matter all that much. You might not even notice. Whether it's a crab cake sandwich or plate of fish and chips, the food at Buster's is just that dam good."}
{"text":"I'm a seafood lover so I was excited to finally try buster's sea cove in the st Lawrence market! There's always a line up there every time I went to the market and this time (a Saturday) there was one as well. Seating was limited, but being there at around 2pm, I was able to find two seats. Even with a line, it didn't take long for the boyfriend to put down an order, so don't be afraid to line up!!   We recently came back from a trip to Seattle and just loved the clam chowder at pike place market. So, we ordered the New England clam chowder and the haddock fish and chips.   * New England clam chowder: pike place still takes first place!! But this one at buster's is pretty good. You can taste the clams although it got kind of watery half way through. It didn't feel very hearty to me as there wasn't many chunks of clams or potatoes or what have you. Though, It's a pretty decent chowder.   * Haddock and chips: I'm not a big fan of the fish and chips here at buster's. The batter is light, but it doesn't have much taste to it. The batter was also not crispy. The haddock itself, is a little dry. I was expecting it to be a tougher texture, but it shouldn't feel dry. Also not much seasoning. Kind of reminds me of fish filets/fish sticks that come in a box in the frozen aisle. The fries, were definitely not made fresh (even with the lineup?!). They weren't crispy nor too soggy. Saving grace was their tartar sauce, it tasted home made and gave the fish some flavour. It also comes with a little container of slaw.   All in all, my experience here at buster's st Lawrence market was only so-so (food wasn't as fresh and service was a little rushed). Maybe I just had high expectations! Might give the other menu items a try next time."}
{"text":"Buster's, simply put, rocks. Delicious, super fresh food nestled amongst the numerous vendors in vibrant St. Lawrence Market. If you're lucky enough to snag a table inside, you can eat right on the spot. If it's nice outside, grab a picnic table on the patio and watch the world go by while you happily devour your food.  I'm no salad girl but their enormous Salmon Salad is spectacular."}
{"text":"Decent effort, but didn't live up to the hype. Halibut sandwich was decent, not outstanding. Lobster bisque was extremely salty."}
{"text":"Love the runs melt! Almost asked the person next to me if I could have a bite of their fried octopus. Long line but they speed it up by taking your order while in line, so little wait. Excellent food and very nice staff!"}
{"text":"Tried the grilled mahi mahi and the seafood orzo.  Both tasted fine but not good enough for me to want to go back.  What else...portions are big, lineups are often long, cash only, limited seating (you can sit outside)."}
{"text":"Really hit or miss. The highlights are the Calamari Po' Boy (super tender), Clam Chowder was pretty tasty but pricey.  However, the crab cakes were so salty I couldn't eat them, the coconut shrimp were so crispy from being deep fried that all flavour was missing.  I prefer fresh cut fries like the ones at the original location, these ones are thin and again very crispy and lacking flavour.  Overall for the same price you might as well go to a restaurant and get some better prepared seafood."}
{"text":"This gem in St. Lawrence Market is worth waiting for in line. I recommend their grilled salmon sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious we had Norwegian cod and lobster roll! Highly recommend a stop there!"}
{"text":"If you love sea food, fried or sandwich this is the place to  check out.  The Halibut & haddock sandwich is my favourite.  Located at St. Lawrence Market and new location 876 Yonge St and Davenport Rd."}
{"text":"Was there on Aug, 12 2014, had Swordfish (ok) and Fries (full of fat, warmed up, absolutely not fresh !!) / I went back to report this and neither got a refund nor the offer  for an exchanges. There are a lot of better offers in St. Lawrence Market than this."}
{"text":"The best thing to order is the clam chowder.  Very fresh clams create a clean seafood broth.  Subtle flavors of the sea in a creamy soup.    Skip the fried clams with fries.  It's a mountain of coleslaw, over a mountain of fries, sprinkled with fried clams."}
{"text":"I came here today with my family and I have mixed feelings on this place. I ordered the halibut and chips, and my parents both ordered the shrimp po boy with chips. We also decided to split a cup of the chicken and shrimp gumbo.   The fish was delicious. The breading was crispy and the halibut was flaky and fresh. I took a bite of the po boy and it was great! Even the bread had an awesome texture/flavor! By the way, don't overlook the cabbage slaw underneath everything. It's crunchy, slightly sweet, and beautifully compliments the fried seafood. The gumbo, on the other hand, was absolutely disgusting. It tasted like something that came out of a can. No flavor, not enough rice or veggies, and the chicken tasted processed. Come on, guys. You can do better than charging $5 for a small cup of canned soup.   PS: cash only!"}
{"text":"they are pretty good oh my lord Murphy Bob n Doug Mackenzie, yeah check these guys out you will like it I bet maybe."}
{"text":"Wrong address so we have to find a nearby restaurant. Check the reviews to find the right address. I will update it when I visit this area next time."}
{"text":"At the market today, noticed this place by total fluke. Damn glad I did.  Ordered the po boy sandwich, one word . . .  freakin awesome!!!!!!! Pefectly seasoned fried shrimp with spicy down-south heat. Lil touches that make a B-I-G difference. Tasty dressing, maybe garlic-aioli,dunno. Crispy/crunchy pickles, onions, cucumbers added fab flavour and texture. Toasted panini styled flat bread was also totally righteous.   Only thing keeping me from giving a perfect 5/5 score . . . price. $9.99 Lil bit on the high side, but it won't keep me from coming back. Love this place."}
{"text":"Thrilled that they opened a location closer to me. I frequented their St. Lawrence outlet for nearly a decade. This location doesn't have the charm of the old place, but the food is just as good."}
{"text":"$14.25 for Halibut and chips.  The fries were quite good, but the thing I'm paying an exorbitant amount of money for - the halibut - was disappointing.  Three very small pieces of Halibut, and each piece was only about 1/3 fish, the rest being dough.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Stay away from this restaurant. It is total fraud!!! I was supposed to receive $17 change and the cashier only give me $12 and receipt saying $17 change . When I asked where is my $5 bill she yelled at me \"trust me I gave you and you took $5 somewhere\" and treated me like I am the person lying. In my hand only ten dollar bill and two dollar coin and receipt. How am I supposed to magically remove $5 bill from my hand. Also the only reason I paid with cash is because they said no credit card.  When the next person said they don't have any cash , they suddenly take out credit card machine from underneath. Total fraud restaurant!!'   I don't want to this is my first meal in Toronto and don't want to ever visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"Solid halibut and chips. The fish pieces were smaller than other places but you get 4 instead of 2. The tartar sauce was perfect but the coleslaw was lacking."}
{"text":"Don't even bother going here during lunch hour as the line up is always crazy long (you either need to get here before 12pm or sometime after 1pm to avoid the lunch rush).   My favourite thing to get here is the fried calamari and the grilled octopus is also really delicious. The fish and chips seem really popular, but I can't vouch for them because there are so many other menu items to try.   The reason I highly recommend the calamari is because it's crispy, tender and thinly sliced. The cocktail sauce that comes with it, is a bit more vinegary than I would like, but the calamari is also great on it's own. You can also add a side of salad or fries, and the salad is a pretty good choice because the dressing is delicious -- not sure what's in it...the salad itself is nothing special, but the dressing really makes it worth the extra (but you'll probably already be stuffed from just eating the calamari, so save the salad for tomorrow's lunch)."}
{"text":"I had the Calamari Po Boy and it was absolutely delicious! had plenty of crispy calamari on it and they asked me how I spicy I wanted it as they added some hot sauce. although it didn't have that much sauce in the actual sandwich but overall it was still pretty good as it also came with fries. good price for a good portion!"}
{"text":"I went on Sunday lunch hour, it was busy and packed. But, they had a great system where the host takes your order before paying so the chefs start cooking prior. Deep fried calamari and grilled calamari is good. They come with salad which is actually a lot and filling in the end.   There are few seats, but if you can't find any. Try outdoor or even around the market."}
{"text":"Food is half decent.  Employees are very rude and impatient. They don't take credit cards.... I would have spent more I just didn't have the cash."}
{"text":"I love this place. My first time at St. Lawrence Market and I came across this place. This place is a must go!!! We had the halibut sandwich, halibut fish and chips, calamari, and steamed mussels. :') we were very satisfied. You guys will enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best halibut and chips I've had. So fresh. Their tarter sauce is also delicious. They include a mini coleslaw in the order. The only downside is that their should probably be more coleslaw and less fries! So good if you want a quick fish and chips in the financial district for lunch."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during work one day on a recommendation. It was a pretty long line to order and then a long wait to get my food but it was worth it. I ordered the lobster roll which comes with fries. The white bun was perfectly toasted and greasy and was complimented well with lobster which was in big chunks. The food was extra yummy and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood and interesting spices. Yes the price is a little high but I think they had to adjust for rent.  Po'Boys are good but they offer so many options. Calamari is recommended but octopus also looked delicious"}
{"text":"I just moved to a new office in the Southcore area and was pleased to see a Buster's Sea Cove in the new food court!  I tried it yesterday and it was fantastic, had the Shrimp Po Boy which was fried to order.  Lineups are very long and it's not exactly cheap ($10, just the sandwich, comes with no sides), but their seafood is fresh and tastes delicious."}
{"text":"Food deserves 3 star, service and eating environment deserve 0 star.  I was by myself and ordered the recommended mahi mahi and added a side order of grilled shrimp, the total for these two came out to $31.  So not exactly cheap.  After I stood in line and got my mahi mahi, my shrimp was nowhere in sight, it's not on the grill, nor was it on any plate, so they forgot to cook my shrimp.  I found a seat and decided to put my fish there and to wait for my shrimp, another 5 mins passed my shrimp is still not ready, I asked the guy how much longer?  It's been awhile, my number was 270 and they were already calling 280s.  The guy was totally rude and said no it hasn't been long, so I waited more, still no shrimp and my fish was gettin cold, unattended on the table.  I got so fed up I told them I'd like to cancel my order.  They were still not apologetic, one guy asked me u do want ur shrimp cooked right? I said all u had to do is to admit u forgot to cook my shrimp and apologize for the long wait.    Regarding the food, mahi mahi was overcooked, I would not order again.  The shrimp was good, but nothing special, I can make this at home too.  If they haven't upset me so much, I would like to try their crab cake and calamari.  But that's not gonna happen now."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to St Lawrence Market I usually have to come to this place for the lobster roll, it's my go-to place.   I love that the lobster roll had big chunks of lobster in it. The bun that came with it was okay, but I think the one they had before was even better. The lobster roll came with lots of fries, lemon wedges and a pickle.   Yes, they do have long line ups but they go by really fast because they have someone coming to you to take orders.   I say it's more worth it than seeing their food trucks because the food trucks sell it for bit more and doesn't come with fries, but bag of chips instead."}
{"text":"Love the Clams,  however the halibut fish and chips had thick batter, I wondered if the fish was actually halibut."}
{"text":"I went to Buster for the first time just before the summer, on a friend's recommendation. He said I HAD to try the swordfish sandwich. I usually don't really like fish sandwiches but he was so insistent I just gave in. I'm so so happy I did.  I brought a friend who was visiting from Norway with me and we couldn't believe how delicious it was. It tastes almost more like meat then fish, but it's still refined like fish. Don't pass on the fries, they are amazing too.  The place gets crowded during lunch time but I've never waited more then 10 minutes for my food to be ready.  I have made it a habit to bring all my friends who visit from abroad now. If the sandwich is too much, try the crab salad, delicious as well."}
{"text":"Worst. Food.Ever.  Was it an off night? Can not believe how awful the food was after seeing so many glowing reports.  The batter on the haddock was as thick as a loaf of bread, the fish was dry and the fries were tough.  The tables were dirty.  No thanks.  My friend had jumbo shrimp the size of regular shrimp and they were so greasy.  Eek! METHINKS NOT for sure. There are just too many awesome other places in Toronto to eat fish."}
{"text":"My third visit to Buster's Sea Cove finally warranted a review on Yelp. I work in the area and often visit the St. Lawrence Market for lunch. This is my third time in a half a year eating here. I've had the fried calamari and the bluefin fish n' chips before. Normally there's a crazy lunch lineup but on Tuesday, there were only a few people in front of me.  I ordered the halibut and chips and got my order quickly. Meanwhile, my friend ordered the grilled calamari and chips and waited way too long.  Issues: - The line cook at the grill used the same pair of tongs to handle raw fish/seafood and the cooked fish/seafood (cross-contamination)! -  The line cook grilled the calamari for around 10 minutes, leaving my friend to chew and chew and chew and dumping her meal after the first piece of calamari. - The head cook/guy who expedited was rude when I asked about my friend's meal (\"he's cooking it now!\") - The order for #120 (grilled calamari and salad) was called out and given to the client before my friend's order (#108). How rude!! - My fried halibut was massacred and was already so on the tray the fryer cook used to transport for plating. - No finesse, no care in the handling of food. Yes, you're busy, but dumping food on a plate and serving underpar food makes you lose customers, reputation and gain shitty reviews like this one."}
{"text":"I have been here before a couple years ago and it's definitely improved. Particularly the coleslaw is much better.  I like that they use a light batter on the fish that doesn't hold much oil so it's not totally greasy. Fresh cut shoe string fries are great too. All in all a solid value for your money and worth a visit."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place out for ages, but because constant line ups, always put it off for another day.  This time, we came to the Market for to eat, and was not going to leave without trying Buster.  We order the Boston Blue Fish and chip based on the recommendation of the lady in front of us, who claimed its what she always ordered.  We found it was interesting to see she picked up a swordfish sandwich when her order came up.  the portion was huge for $10, but we were underwhelm with the whole plate.   The slaw was under season, warm and runny.  The fries were okay but the 4 pieces of fish were slightly cooked.    May try again next time, but will order something else."}
{"text":"I think like most people, I'm not a fan of fish. I'm not one to say \"Man, I could so good from some salmon right now\".  However, I have a number of friends that do say that. SO I asked them if I were to go anywhere in the city to get fish where would it be? 2/3 people said I should go to Buster's Sea Cove. So the next time I was at St Lawrence Market I decided to give it a shot.   For the first time in my life, I crave fish. I loved their crab cake sandwich. It was prefect! Not to mention the coleslaw that you get with it. This place is a total winner. If you are one to never consider seafood, you should reconsider.   If you were in the area like me and in the area please give it a try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I have been to Lawerence market a feew times but had never noticed this place as it is right at the back.  Went here based on recomendations from this site and got a Haddock sandwich (10 bucks).  Amazing stuff.  The haddock tastes really fresh and the batter is very light and crispy.  Cannot recommend this place enough"}
{"text":"Over rated by most, IMHO. Ordered Halibut+chips and found a deep fried shrimp mixed in with the chips - Bonus! Nothing about this place has blown me away, this was probably my third visit. I guess its the only place to get fried seafood (street level, not sure about in the basement) in the market so its always busy. But I find I alway end up eating something here - so I up the rating to 2.5 Stars!"}
{"text":"A fav in the 'hood. Haddock sammy special is perfectly balanced with huge chunks of lightly battered fish, crisp veggies and a toasted bun. Love that they don't drown their coleslaw in mayo-- it's much lighter. Fries are typical thin curly fries.   Seafood orzo is packed with hunks of shrimp, scallops, shell-in mussels, etc. in a tomato-based sauce. Very tasty, but can take some time since it's made to order.  Deep- fried smelt is salty, fishy goodness--I like having it with salad to offset the fried-ness of it all. They give you a ton and you'll get approving nods from the older European or Asian grannies if you have an order sitting before you ;)  Bisque is a touch salty, but creamy and tasty nonetheless.  Never had an issue with the ordering. You queue on the left, then move to the right to wait for your order after paying. The staff is incredibly efficient, IMO, and I go nearly every weekend since I live in the area. It's often busy, but sane-- hey, you get more disorganization at your average bar when you order drinks :)  As others have said, it's nicest to grab you order and go sit outside to enjoy your food! But if you can squeeze into a seat, it's great for people-watching, too."}
{"text":"Really great- I got the halibut on bun, hubby got the fish and chips, and son got the chicken strips. Al of it was fresh, plentiful, and delicious. The only reason I deducted one star is for the price & not enough seating."}
{"text":"The owner emailed me and asked me to let him know when we will come back.  He was very forthcoming and wants to make things right.  This is what all owners of restaurants should do if they want to keep their customers happy!"}
{"text":"Best fish sandwiches in the city! So fresh and delicious! My favorite is the grilled tilapia sandwich, but I haven't had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"This place is the go to spot in St Lawrence Market for delicious seafood.  Staff is quick and handle the large crowds of customers in a very efficient manner.  That being said, I have to deduct points for the lack of seating on weekends and more importantly their price/portion ratio seems off.  I paid over $13 for halibut and chips.  Got less fish than I do at other similar establishments.    However, the quality is top notch."}
{"text":"In St. Lawrence Market there lays a secret seafood haven called Buster's Sea Cove.   There are many choices to get your seafood fix on. Halibut, Boston Bluefish, Swordfish, Mussels, Smelts, Calamari, and Crab cakes just to name a few. For a side order one can choose fries, salad, coleslaw, have their selection fried or grilled, or on a sandwich. We were mesmerized at the menu selection for a while. And when we're hungry we get picky  :)  We finally decided on a crab cake sandwich and halibut sandwich. We shared the two sandwiches. This was splendid. Food is extremely fresh, tasty, cooked perfectly and fast. It just melts in your mouth with no bad aftertaste.  Buster Sea Cove is a great way to enjoy the fresh imported seafood of the St. Lawrence Market in the moment. It delivered in a big way, we'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"For a $15 lunch halibut and fries, it was very mediocre. This is my first time and there was a line up before noon. My parents and I wanted to try it so we all shared and discussed whether it was good or not while we ate.  The coleslaw was crisp and light, not too wet. that was 3.5/5 as it was a little bland. The fries were tiny, slightly soggy, over cooked, barely warm. Not impressed, 2/5. The star of the dish! Deep fried battered Halibut. It was mediocre at best, 2/5. Fish tasted fresh, however, it was over cooked, and batter (perhaps because it was overcooked) was nothing special.  Pretty disappointed and have definitely had better fish and chips for $15 a plate. Does not live up to the promises of all 5-star or 4-star reviews from the past. Lower your expectations when trying Buster's Sea Cover for the first time.  Not returning here for a line up of mediocre fish and chips. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least five times and have never had a bad experience.  The lineups seem long but the food comes up fairly quickly.  It's a great place to have a quick lunch.  The fish and chips are the best I've ever had.  It's not too greasy and the fries are actually delicious as well (both I find difficult to achieve whenever I get fish and chips).  The coleslaw is a nice touch, however, I feel like it could use a bit more flavour.  The crab cake sandwich was simply delicious and is even better with some sriracha sauce.  The grilled calamari salad was perfectly flavoured, not chewy and not too oily.   I will definitely be returning to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"We got the mussels ($13), seafood orzo ($15), fish and chips (I forgot to take a picture of that side of the menu, so no price) and halibut sandwich. The mussels were juicy and yummy and came with a side of grilled bread, which was great to dip up the sauce. The seafood orzo wouldn't have been my personal first choice, but I'm so glad we got it! The tomato broth absorbed all the great seafood flavor-- I could have just eaten that and been really happy. Their fries are skinny and well-fried (not limp and sad) and the sandwich was well-dressed, with cucumbers (in addition to to the usual lettuce and tomatoes) to give it a good crunch.   I am partial, weirdly, to places where you need to hover to get a table-- I usually feel pretty triumphant when I get one-- but if you don't like having tons of people around when you're eating, I would stay away. Also, there was a quite a line, but don't be scared! Someone will come down the line and take your order, so the process won't take nearly as long as you fear."}
{"text":"This place is half decent. Being a tourist, I couldn't resist the trap when the line up was gone in late afternoon.    It's ok if you don't have to wait in line."}
{"text":"Really unique place hidden in St.Lawrence Market itself. I love their grilled sandwiches. Had the grilled swordfish, which was fantastic. Their own sauces really go well with the meat. Would love to go back and see how their other grilled/fried fish taste like. If you ever stop by St.Lawrence Market, make sure to check out this place: not something you see everyday."}
{"text":"The lobster roll is a bit small but it was amazingly tasty.  One of the best I have tasted.  The salad that came with it was fresh and the vinaigrette dressing was yummy.  The Mahi mahi sandwich was incredible tasty too.  Everything was very fresh, I wish it wasn't closed on Sunday because I would have definitely gone back for more lobster roll."}
{"text":"We were hungry for seafood after a visit to the nearby Aquarium. It's hard to find, but the other yelp reviewers helped. I think the address is wrong - I think it's 120 Bremner - second floor. We went during the holiday so the lineup wasn't long - but it was definitely busier than the neighbouring shops.   They have a low salt option for the fries. However, they were well soaked in grease from grilled squid so we ended up with a food coma later on. Which makes me wonder how all the office workers fare after eating at this place.  We went with kids which worked well in the food court area as it was super clean and open, but they did lack child booster seats like an average mall would have."}
{"text":"I came back here for the shrimp po'boy and my suspicions were correct. Stay away from the fry section! Get your fish and chips else where and stick to the sandwiches and grilled stuff!  This is one of the best po'boys if not the best one I've had. Nice meaty shrimp, well flavoured and nicely battered. Not too thick. Shrimp was not over cooked either!   Still a little pricey but definitely more worth it than the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Good looking menu with a wide variety of seafood (grilled plates, sandwiches, soups, fried/grilled, shellfish, etc). That being said, my chowder was so so. It tasted a little weird and the clams were very chewy. I liked the vibe of the place so I'd probably go there again."}
{"text":"Worst lobster roll I have ever seen! The lobster meat was minced where I can't even tell if I am eating lobster. Such a disgrace to call that lobster amd sell it to comsumers. The service is rude and even rude to each other. $15 wasted! The fries were not worth that much. AVOID THIS PLACE WHEN YOU COME TO THIS MARKET! Buy the seafood drop the local vendors instead. RIP OFF!!!!! I even wrote this while sitting there because it was so bad to look at"}
{"text":"Restaurant: Buster's Sea Cove Cuisine: Seafood Location: St Lawrence Market Address: 93 Front St E Price Range: $10-15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3  Service: 2  Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3   Extra information:  *Located inside of St Lawrence Market *Limited seating infront of the store *Different special of the day *Food court style  Buster's Sea Cove reminds me of Granville Island in Vancouver, BC. They specialize in seafood and most of their customers are tourists, serving Grilled seafood, sandwiches, salads, fish & chips, mussels and soups.  Buster's Sea Cove works like a food court, you go up to the cashier and make your order and pay. And then they will give you a number and you wait until they give you their food.  You can do take out which a lot of people seemed to do, or grab one of the chairs to 'dine in'. When I was there, they had around 4-5 cooks behind the counter working super fast. So even if there are a lot of people waiting for their food, don't worry about it- your food will be served very quickly.  Ordered: BOSTON BLUE FISH & CHIPS 3/5 *4 pieces of boston blue fish served with coleslaw and curly fries for $8.85 *Fish is thin and flat with overall very light batter *It's not seasoned at all so you need to add something or use the tartar sauce *Tartar sauce was kind of bland, it could use more kick since the fish is unseasoned as well *There are ketchup, hot sauce, malt vinegar on the table if you need them *coleslaw was refreshing but again, needed more seasoning *Curly fries were nothing special and it was soggy  Ordered: CRAB CAKE SANDWICH 3/5 *Crabcake sandwich served with coleslaw for $8.95 *2 small crabcakes inside the sandwich *crabcakes are mushy (not much crab meat, more doughy) *They had consistency of a soft oden *It wasn't the best crab cake I've tasted but it was decent as a sandwich *Lots of fresh veggies and the sauce went well with the bread  I noticed a lot of people were getting the grilled calamari or shrimp- especially those ones who were getting it to go. Maybe they are regulars and they know what's good here (share all the details!)  Summary: Seafood is fresh but overall the food is kind of bland. The quality of ingredients makes up for the lack of seasoning. I would go back one more time to try the grilled calamari."}
{"text":"Hit this place up last week when we were at St. Lawrence Market because, well, when else will you get lobster rolls? Was a little disappointed with the portion which I had with a side of caesar salad.  I understand that lobster is expensive but I personally didn't think it was worth the cost.  It also came with a slice of dill pickle and coleslaw.  I took one scoop of the coleslaw and I found it quite fishy.  Thank goodness I had the side of caesar to go with the roll.  3/5.  If you're hungry, I'd recommend getting something else to go with the meal.  What I did find impressive was their service.  With the long line-up, there were servers taking orders while you were in line to speed up the line.  I mean, you still had to wait for your order, but it was still very well organized."}
{"text":"I had their octopus last week, and I must say it was rather excellent. It was well out of my price range though, so I don't see me going for it again (nearly $15 for some octopus with their amazing fries is just a bit too much for me).  I definitely will be going back to try other things on their menu, as well as the usual things I typically get."}
{"text":"For something located in St. Lawrence Market, it was disappointing. I tried the crab cake and fish and chips and it wasn't good, just edible and a waste of money. Wouldn't recommend or come back. Two stars for decent service. One star for food."}
{"text":"Buster's Sea Cove is so hyped up among Yelpers, that it may have gave me too high of expectations.   Okay. $20 for a tiny lobster roll that is about the vertical length of my palm? It seems to be squished in between on piece of toast, and I counted only two actual bite size pieces of lobster. I also found it to be on the salty side - you must complement each bite with some coleslaw.   Service was lousy given that this is a 'marketplace' - lots of yelling, customers arguing over who's lobster roll came first, fighting for seats...etc.   Personally, the lobster roll here is over-rated and over-priced.   I'll try their fish and chips next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I just had the shrimp po-boy with a side of fries. It really was just meh to me. I guess I was expecting something similar to the po-boys I've had down in New Orleans, with french bread, proper toasted and a smear of mayo, so I was disappointed. I didn't like the bread - too soft, not toasted enough, and then laden down with their sauce. The shrimp itself were nicely done, I ended up just eating them with the fries, which were pretty good! If I go back, I'll go for the chowder or maybe fish sandwich on a bun."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I will go out of my way to tell everyone I know not to even think of going to this establishment  Never have I paid so much for so little and to try and tolerate rude staff also  My wife had grilled snapper with fries. You needed a microscope to find the snapper, should have ordered fires with a hint of Snapper  I had a lobster roll and was hard pressed to find the lobster amongst the four inch roll.  We all make dining mistakes. I made the biggest one of my life today"}
{"text":"I went to this location now and then as it is closer from work than the St Lawrence Market.  To be honest this location taste good, but not as good as St Lawrence Market.  The portion is smaller.  They did have breakfast menu.  The breakfast is so-so, not tempting enough for return trip.  I am pretty sure I recall no coffee, but it might be the first 2 weeks when it opened.  I will not buy from Ritual for this place, as the fried food become soggy from the steam treatment inside containers when piping hot.  I will return when I need a treat for somewhere close by work.  Still prefer St Lawrence's."}
{"text":"The wifey & I actually hit up their food truck @ the CNE a couple of summers ago & since then have tried pretty much their entire menu. Can't go wrong with the lobster roll, fish taco all juiced up with lime. Good times & good eats!"}
{"text":"Somehow I managed to get in line during a lull and didn't have to wait too long for my first meal at Buster's Sea Cove. Once I sat down with my meal, the line had grown three-fold so perhaps budget a bit of extra time in case it's a bit busy.   I got the grilled swordfish sandwich. I did want to know a bit about where the swordfish was fished, but probably not the best time to ask during the busy lunch hour, so I'll just see if I can get a better response through email or social media.   The sandwich was pretty spot on. Everything you'd want in a fish sandwich. However, the sides were bland - the slaw was uninteresting and the fries were skinny and soggy.   I will go back to try other things, but never again shall I order sides. It's all seafood for me here."}
{"text":"Yeah.. for $15-16 from a food court I expect much more than what I got. Ordered the haddock fish and chips. Completely uninspiring. I wasn't that impressed with the St Lawrence location, and this was even worse. The fries... oh man. Shoe string frozen. They were barely edible when they were hot, and when they got colder it was disgusting.  Never again."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. I work in the financial district so this is a short walk.  Go early around 11:45 to beat the lunch rush. Solid food with fast service. I would go again!  There is also some outdoor seating which is good on a nice day to have your lunch in the patio.   I ordered the tuna melt and I was stuffed after. Well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Great clam chowder. I have enjoyed three different times and can say the  recipe is consistently very good. I wish they had hand cut fries but I will return for the soup and service."}
{"text":"3.5 stars...I wanted to give it 4 stars, but it just wasn't there. First, let me say their operation is crazy, in a good way!! They fired off so many orders--never seen anything like it. We had the shrimp po' boy, calamari po' boy, and fries. The shrimp po' boy was good, but could've used more shrimp. Calamari one was good, but the calamari  needed to be fried a little more. The fries were not bad. Maybe next time we'll try something else?"}
{"text":"Make sure to check what the waitress did to your bill. I ordered a crab cake sandwich with NO fries or salad last week. And I payed by debit card. When the waitress gave me the machine, it asked me for the password which means skipped the tip selection. But I didn't think too much. And that waitress didn't give me the receipt. But when I checked my bank statement today, it showed that I spent 14.xx dollars. I know there is a tax on that but it shouldn't be more that $14.  Because the crab cake sandwich  is 9.95. I feel so disappointed with their tricks."}
{"text":"Not horrible, but have had better fish and chips at a few random pubs in the city.  Was very excited and walked 20 minutes to get there for my last lunch in Toronto and was pretty upset I didn't save my $15 and go to the pizza stand next to it... Perhaps it was the Halibut...who knows...just not my cup of tea.."}
{"text":"Good and healty food. Taste fresh and amazing serving dish. Colorful, yummy and healty."}
{"text":"Busy place on Friday afternoon... I think if it's busy than it should be good.. And yes it was great... I haven't had fish and chips in a long time... I had halibut.. So good... Very busy and not enough tabled but it worth it.."}
{"text":"Do people on yelp have fat fingers or something? I do not understand all the 5 stars for the \"fresh\" seafood at this place.   I've been here a few times to discover what all this Yelp hype is about and each time was utterly disappointed.   The lobster roll is a friggin scam with maybe 1 or 2 small chunks of lobster actually in it and its salty as hell. Even for a salt lover like me it was too overwhelming. The toasted bun was drenched in butter and salty as hell. The fries that accompanied it were greasy and a lot of them were burnt. The coleslaw was bland and tasted like paper. The only thing that stood out in the dish was the dill pickle! I am betting that the people that unfortunately ordered the lobster roll are all nodding in agreement. Especially after dropping almost $20 bucks for this BS!  Previously, I have also tried the haddock and chips. The fish batter is so flippin greasy and starchy that it feels like you are eating a crunchy layer of oily flour and taco shell when you actually get to the soggy fish its too late you have already puked in your mouth. The chips are same as the previous opinion. Im sorry for being so descriptive but I do not know any other way to describe it.   Sorry yelp not a fan at all! *gag* blacklist!"}
{"text":"I was originally going to give it three stars with my initial visit, but after a second time, I realized that two stars would better reflect its quality. Let's start off with service. I realize that the restaurant is earning money like crazy because the line never stops and it's never empty. But please, treat your customers with some respect. There was a Chinese tourist in front of me who couldn't make up her mind right away when she got to the server, and he got so fed up. He basically insinuated that she was stupid. There's also a rush to place your order and leave (operational efficiency, I guess), which really detracts from everything. You pretty much get pushed aside if you can't make a decision ASAP. The first time, we had the swordfish salad. The swordfish was okay, pretty interesting taste, but very oily. The second time, we decided to try the lobster rolls (what they're famous for). The portions are TINY and not worth the price point. The amount of lobster in that roll was less than my two fingers combined. It was an absolute rip-off, and didn't even taste good. Am definitely not returning."}
{"text":"I love this place but today my review is opinionated on the poor service I received - I went fairly towards closing time and I Ordered for a lobster roll. The lobster roll on the food truck is for $10 and come with a pickle & a bag of chips.  Here I paid $17 and all I got was the tiniest roll with coleslaw.  I don't mind getting short changed for food but maybe they could have charged me lesser if they were going to give me less.  Overall- it's a very creative kitchen, great food but expensive!"}
{"text":"I was just reading a couple reviews about this place, which i go to almost every Saturday, and came across to one of the reviews mentioned earlier from Lesia B. I just want to say that i actually was sitting beside, at the counter that day, and saw how this lady came by to complain about her fish, saying that it \"taste fishy\" ...I clearly saw that the owner never licked his fingers or touched any other food, he instead gave her a new order, which she was happy to take with her. I think this lady is being very unfairly to go home and post a review like that, and put dirt on the owner. Just for more information for Leisa B, I am a health professional in Ontario, and can clearly state, that you can not get HEP B or C  from eating food, its only contaminated through blood. I have been eating there for about 5 years and never saw anything suspicious, its a great place with a super friendly staff. I am very glad that i actually witnessed something like this and able to say the truth."}
{"text":"Tried this place out at a food festival in Downsview Park last year. Finally got to come into St. Lawrence market to try it again. Had the lobster roll with fries and it was as yummy as I remembered it!"}
{"text":"Came by late afternoon to try their famous lobster roll and must say, for the price I was a tad disappointed. At 15 bucks, the roll was served on what seemed to be s hotdog bun and was far from overflowing. It was unevenly placed and there were lots of parts with just white bread making it unappealing to look at. The taste however was much better as it wasn't over dressed and the salad it came with was actually quite big and fresh. The only problem was a size for price issue. Also tried a halibut on a bun with added rings and it was much better. Much larger in size, it was a fillet of fried halibut with tomatoes, lettuce and a nice ciabatta bun. The rings were a small portion but fresh from the fryer.   Overall, I was expecting a bit more and was left underwhelmed."}
{"text":"My husband and I came back again to try the deep fried smelts, crab cake sandwich/ panini, and regular old fish and chips ... once again, soooo awesome!  I think my favourite out of the three was the crab cake panini/ sandwich ... although it was a little heavy on the mayo sauce, it was scrumptious!  The fish and chips were pretty good too.  Not a fan of the chips at all - they are the soft oily kind.  I like crisp battered fries.  The fish itself was flaky and melt in your mouth fried goodness ... yum!!!  The smelts were a little larger and fishier and less battered than I expected.  Not bad but I unfortunately can't say I was in love this dish :(    Ohh.... we'll probably be back this weekend ... I want to try the entire menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to grab some food here and being that they had fish and chips I thought 'why not'.  This place does get busy the few times I have been to the market the tables are always full and there is always a line for this place in the afternoon.  Order was taken in the line and by the time we get to the front we are asked again about our order so I think they do this to ensure whatever you order is in the fryer and fresh out by the time you get your order.  These guys are efficient, the fish shop equivalent of a car manufacturing line and amongst all the shouting out of orders and requests for this and that they seem to get the orders out quick.  Seating is a problem during busy times and the are is pretty crammed in general.  Okay so to the fish and chips - the fish itself was really nice. I would go so far as saying the best fried fish I have had for the money. The only downside was the fries were just thin, overcooked  and crappy."}
{"text":"In mid-August I came to St. Lawrence Market with my family and boyfriend for a lunch where everyone could pick something from a different stall (as we all have different dietary preferences), eat together, and be happy.  As it turned out, I was the only one who didn't order food from Buster's Sea Cove. My dad and sister were very pleased with the grilled squid and said everything they ordered was great.  However.  My boyfriend is very particular about the things he eats. To avoid problems, he always requests no sauces, no garnish, just the main event. On this occasion, that was fried clams and chips.  We knew from a previous stop by this shop that coleslaw comes on the side of the dish without warning. Well, no big deal- just eat around it if you don't like it, right?  But this time my boyfriend specified \"No coleslaw\" to the woman taking his order. She repeated back \"no coleslaw.\"  When the dish came out... a big plop of coleslaw was in the center, right on top of the fried clams and chips. And when he tried to explain, the guy behind the counter said \"You're not getting a refund.\"  So my boyfriend left empty handed, out $11, unable to enjoy our lunchtime conversation and frustrated by the service he'd received.  I'd watch out at Buster's if you have a food allergy, since they clearly don't value customer requests. But honestly- with this kind of service, you're better off taking your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of the best clam strips in town. Got the double clams big portion in my opinion . No fuss in and out service. Gets really busy during lunch however and pick up can sometimes get confusing. This location is within St. Lawrence market lots of tourist and locals ordering."}
{"text":"I've given this place 3 tries. It's been overpriced, incredibly slow, and mediocre in taste. By the way, they don't take credit cards and they have a surcharge for all debit transactions.  * Seafood Orzo: It was one of their \"recommended dishes,\" but it was the worst thing I had here. They have a little portable burner and a skillet, they throw some oil and pre-cooked orzo from a container, then they add the pre-made marinara from another container, add the seafood, then butter, oil and cheese. There must have been over 1800 calories in that container because the top was a lake of oil.  * Grilled swordfish with salad: I thought this was the healthy option, and everything was going well until the guy slathers the fish in butter/oil... The whole thing was drenched in it, and it was all I could taste! It was really mediocre, and oily as f.  * Fish and chips: This was probably the best dish, but even then, it was nothing special.  My 2 star review has nothing to do with the unhealthy factor. It was purely due to the mediocre taste and poor price value."}
{"text":"This place is always the busiest stall at St. Lawrence Market. Seating limited.  If you are wanting to order fish and chips, go for the halibut (2 pc). The haddock (3 pc) looked like frozen fish fingers and the batter was quite strange. The halibut on the other hand was your textbook fried fish. FIsh is a tad overcooked. However the tartar sauce is amazing and the coleslaw was refreshing. Undoubtedly the fries were out of these world!!!! Hands down the best fries from a fish and chip order, and some of the best fries in general.   Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"This St Lawrence seafood place always has a line up but I'm not sure if it's worth the wait.  I got their haddock and chips which was okay. The tartar sauce was pretty bland and the fish could have used more seasoning. I really liked their thin cut fries though.  The first time I tried them was their food truck and had their lobster roll. My advice is to pay extra and treat yourself to it cause that's worth 4 stars. Fish and chips bring it down."}
{"text":"Tucked in the back of the market, this seafood lunch spot is a great find!  I got the shrimp po'boy and was blown away.  The shrimp tasted fresh, and the sandwich had the perfect balance of spice and mayo :)"}
{"text":"Yes there always line ups and after having eaten there I am at a loss to explain why.    I had the halibut and chips.  WORST fish and chips I have ever had.  Tried to eat it but had to throw it out it was SO bad.  The breading on the fish was soggy, bordering rubbery.  The knife couldn't cut through it because it was so soggy.  The chips were cold.  Would never eat there again even if it were free.  Hard pass"}
{"text":"Alrighty...  So I've been here a few times and I've always been pretty happy with my food.  I've had different sandwiches, fish and chips, mussels, calamari, etc.  All have been very good or great.    Today was an interesting experience.  I managed to feel a full range of emotions:  excitement, annoyance, frustration, surprise, acceptance, and a level of satisfaction.    I ordered the grilled halibut steak with salad.  I was excited to try something different as I've never ordered this before.  When I stuck my fork in the fish, I immediately thought it was overcooked.  My husband thought it was inedible.  It was hard, not flaky, it was over-grilled (too much charring on the skin).  I was at first stunned, because I really didn't know what to do.    I told one of the cooks.  He said it was the bone.  The bone is hard.  Gee, thanks, I think I know the difference between the flesh and the bone.  This annoyed me quite a bit.  He showed it to the man at the grill.  He also said, no, it's not overcooked.  That's how it's cooked.  Now I'm getting frustrated.  I've had halibut before and I've never had it so tough.  The woman next to me decided to give me her two cents saying these guys know what they're doing and asked if I've eaten here before.  I said yes, and this is the first time I actually didn't like my order and felt I had to say something.  Then she started going on about how halibut isn't the best fish...  and in my mind I'm thinking: Why is it so expensive if it's not a good fish?  Why do they sell so much of it if it's not good?  Whatever.  She left.  Bye!    So we're sitting along the counter right in front of the cooks, i'm slowly picking at the salad and  my fish.  I'm trying to mix the fish in with the dressing and tartar sauce to give it some moisture that it so desperately needed.  Out of nowhere, the grilling man asks if I would like to try a piece of swordfish.  I was surprised at this gesture and said, okay.  He gave me a nice-sized piece and asked if I wanted to try it with some butter and I said, okay.  Let me tell you, when I was first told that my halibut was grilled just fine, it was not in the friendliest tone.  The fact that I was being offered anything at all was a huge shock.  In my mind I was already forming the one star review.  (By the way, the grilled swordfish compared to my halibut was like night and day.  The fish was moist, seasoned, and flavourful.  Sure it was drenched in butter, but the texture of the fish itself was proper.)  I spoke to the grilling man before we left just to say thank you for the gesture.  I admitted that perhaps my choice of the halibut steak was not the best.  I accept responsibility for that.  I didn't know what that cut of fish was going to taste like.  At the same time, I think initially, things could've been handled differently.  Tell me the halibut steak is going to be a firmer texture instead of just saying it's cooked right.  Yes, this place was slammed and the line-up was really long.  The last thing they want is someone to complain and to throw off their orders and queue.  Although I didn't finish my order, I was content with the way things ended.  I wasn't going to leave with a bitter feeling after all.   I felt I did the right thing by saying something regardless, but it was the kind exchange that took place that gave me a sense of peace and satisfaction."}
{"text":"This is an off shoot from the store located at St. Lawrence market \"the market\" unless I am mistaken. I had tried the original eons ago and not being a fan of the the tourist trap had not visited it again. Looking to scout for spots that are wheelchair accessible this one stood out. We called in ahead just to confirm as well. They look like a small place but actually have ample seating in the back.  After a bit of look we decided to order the halibut and chips. I added a octopus taco for good measure as well. They fry the fish to order which is appreciated. The potion is decent for the price for this area. The taco is forgettable maybe I should just give up Toronto's take on Mexican food  as nothing even breaks the average mark.  Now for the fish decent batter and served pipping hot. Not overcooked while maintaining the crispiness of the batter. The fries were soggy and forgettable. Hmm its difficult to give a high rating when one essential fails the other as its yin to the yang dilemma that has haunted humanity from time immemorial.   3 stars overall though I will likely be back to give it another go."}
{"text":"Love the fish & chips and calamari here, always fresh and delicious. One of the best food places available at St Lawrence market."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch last week and stood shoulder to shoulder with many other man, sea-food loving, Torontonians.   Having missed the window to order with my collegue by taking a much-deserved bathroom break, I had to go to the back of the line and wait and wait and wait for my swordfish sandwich with fries. I was number 98 and started to get a little impatient as the Buster's crew started calling numbers well into the 100s. Just as the hunger and frustration were starting to reach a peak, they called my number and with jubilation I found a seat outside.  The Swordfish was worth the wait. It was just a pile of lettuce, sauce, mayo and swordfish, which has the most amazing texture. The mouth-feel was amazing! Go, Run, Fly to this place for really fresh sea-food! Just get there early."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin! I am in love with this place. I literally crave it all the time. I've tried many seafood joints and nothing beats buster's. There is always a line up but it goes by so quickly. It's not a surprise since you see the staff move so incredibly fast. I've tried many things here and nothing has disappointed. The chicken gumbo is my favourite soup! The clam chowder and lobster bisque is amazing as well. My go to sandwiches are the red snapper and halibut. Deep fried calamari and grilled calamari salad is amazing too! You can literally get anything on the menu and it would taste great. 10/10!!! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I'm obsessed with the grilled salmon sandwich. The lobster bisque is really good and filling. I like the light coleslaw that it comes with too. The prices are affordable, the staff is really friendly and efficient. The food comes out fast even when there's a super long lunch line during the week. I find it best to come here after 1:30p on a weekday to avoid the long line. Even when there is a line it still moves fast. They only take cash and they have a wide variety of juices and soft drinks that you can order with your food.  My dad got the fried haddock and fries, I tried a bite and they were really good! This might sound weird but I thought it was very clever to put the malt vinegar in a little spray bottle so that when adding it to the fried haddock, there was a nice even distribution of it which made it taste that much better!  Love this place, will definitely return. The only thing I would change is adding more indoor seating nearby, but people seem to get up quickly after finishing so I haven't had an issues finding a seat to eat."}
{"text":"Food was quick, $10 for a shrimp po'boy and I could've licked my fingers dry. Really great food and I recommended it to my friends immediately after. A must visit in St. Lawrence market."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos are not the best but it is nice that the tacos come with two outside shells - still a pretty penny for relatively small portions! I hear Little Fin is pretty great, comparatively."}
{"text":"**This is actually a 2.5 rating**  I had high hopes for this place because I'm in search of a go-to seafood place. And unfortunately after having Busters Cove a handful of times, I'm still searching...  I wanted to try several things on their (quite overwhelming) menu before writing my review but the first and last times are the only times I enjoyed their food. Both times, I had the clams & chips. I'm convinced it's the only thing that is good on the menu.   I've also had the lobster roll and crab cake sandwich. I was extremely disappointed in both. So disappointed, I had to throw my crab cake sandwich in the garbage and almost did for the lobster roll but forced myself to eat the lobster cuz it's lobster damnit! I HAVE NEVER in my life thrown out crab... I just know my tears would've of been bigger if I threw out lobster! Both were bland and for some reason didn't really taste like lobster or crab. After being turned off by both items, I have now realized I'm too scared to try anything else and have made the decision to only eat the one thing I thoroughly enjoyed.... Clams & chips is the only way to go!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!    Mom and I checked this place out while visiting St. Lawrence Market for lunch. I had the mahi mahi sandwich and she had the salmon sandwich. Needless to say there were no leftovers. The cole slaw side was very good as well. Our lunch came to about $22. Very affordable. The only downside to this place is that there isn't enough seating."}
{"text":"Grilled swordfish sandwich Satisfying, fresh and tasty Eat it if you can"}
{"text":"Bar is really low for this one   1. Atmosphere/Ambiance - It is in a market/food court.. I always like my trips to SLM.  The place super busy, and a buss boy was cleaning the floors... gets 7/10  2. Cleanliness - it is a market... prep area looked clean and organize 7/10  3. Service - was really good to speed up the ordering they had broken down in to 3 parts, order/pay/pick up, while ordering the order taker was helpful.. 10/10  4. Food,- Ordered the halibut sandwich, it was ok, fish size was pretty small for price point...  7/10  5. Bonus/uniqueness - I definately want to come back to try their lobster roll and calamari  8/10  Score of 39/50 = 4 stars   Will return"}
{"text":"When you get buster and look at the line don't be discouraged as it moves very quickly. We got homemade crab cake, lobster roll both salad with a side of fries. Although it was good the portions are very small. Also I paid almost $40 and for that amount of money I know a ton other places that I rather spend my money."}
{"text":"Lobster roll was fantastic.  Crayfish po' boy was fantastic.  Grilled squid was fantastic.  The chips were not as fantastic.  I will be back, the menu looks good for a couple more visits before I go home."}
{"text":"The Shrimp Po Boy was pretty tasty. It consists of shrimp pieces in a bun with lettuce, tomatoes, and a spicy homemade hot sauce. If you the get combo it includes fries/salad. Fries needed a salt or perhaps more flavour. If you go later in the day they are most probably out of the seafood you want. Service also depends on the amount of people there."}
{"text":"What a let down! The price and quanity was sooo less than their truck."}
{"text":"There's always a line up here. As they say, when there's a long line up, the food must be GOOD. Hands down, Buster's Sea Cove is my favourite spot at St. Lawrence Market. Everytime I go to St. Lawrence, I have to get something here.  The clam chowder is okay but the crab cakes are absolutely delicious - my mouth is literally watering as I type this.   Whether it's the crab cake sandwich or the salad and fries - try it! The crab cakes are spiced to perfection. Coleslaw is also very good! Also - there's coleslaw at the bottom of the box under the paper. I always forget and almost accidentally throw it out :$  I've also had the coconut shrimp which is very good as well!  I highly recommend this place. It's definitely worth the try. I'll be trying out other options on the menu the next time I visit (but it's so hard to not get the crab cakes :'( )"}
{"text":"Alas! I finally tried buster's sea cove! I've walked by it many times and have seen the long line up. My boyfriend and I decided to give it a try on this cold winter day!  We both got the haddock and chips. I liked how the fish wasn't in too much batter. The fries were pretty good and bountiful. The coleslaw was buried under all the fried goodies! Overall, your standard fish and chips. Nothing amazing, but it might be because this place was so hyped up and my expectations were too high? That, and I was thoroughly uncomfortable and feeling a little cranky from the crowds and lack of seating available (no fault of buster's though, the market itself just doesn't have much space!)  I probably will return though, I want to try the calamari and crab cakes. :)"}
{"text":"I went after the lunch rush so it wasn't as crowded and confusing as most reviewers have mentioned. I didn't have much expectations because I was hungry and was in the mood for some fish and chips.  It didn't take too long to get my food and wondered if they even cooked the fish. Everything was soggy and oily. The breading was too thick, almost like it was wrapped in pancakes. The tartar sauce was really bad. The fries were almost decent but lacked the crispiness that I like on my fries. Thank God for ketchup. The coleslaw - I don't know what that was. It was like cabbage drenched in milk - it was tasteless.  If I was starving and wanted fish and chips and I was at the St. Lawrence Market and if it wasn't crowded, I might actually eat that again. It was edible and the fish did taste fresh."}
{"text":"If you are craving for a swordfish sandwich then this is the place to go.  The food is consistently good, fresh and tasty!  I have not been wronged by this place no matter how busy St. Lawrence Market gets.  I try to order other things but the swordfish is so deliciously flaky and tasty that I just cannot get enough.  I had swordfish sandwiches in Italy and this comes really close to how perfectly cooked the fish is and the ratio of bread to meat is just right so as not to overpower each other."}
{"text":"You know that saying, where there's smoke, there's fire? Typically can be applied to line ups at restaurants as well. Being my first visit to St. Lawrence Market, I had no idea what to try. As a foodie, I naturally wanted everything. So what to choose? Well, the place with the longest lineup of course.   And at lunch time, without a doubt, that award goes to Buster's. The lineup was long for a Wednesday, and for good reason.  Serving up a bevy of fresh seafood choices, from halibut, cod and salmon to bluefish and swordfish, grilled or friend, it's enough to satisfy any seafood lover.   You can get it on a sandwich, on a salad, or with fries, it'll run you about $10-$15 for a meal.  I tried the swordfish sandwich, and it was great. Served on a toasted (focaccia think) bun with some mayo, tomatoes and lettuce, it's a simple sandwich done right. The fish was moist, the bread was fresh, and the sandwich came together beauitfully, not much else you can ask for in a sandwich.  The grilled calamari and the fish & chips here looked pretty good too, with a huge heaping portion of fries. i'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is...Shrimp Po'Boy! Damn good! Incredibly fast and efficient service."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat seafood while in Toronto. Lobster and calamari rolls are amazing! Also, their salmon off the grill salad is perfection!!"}
{"text":"I love seafood! Especially fresh seafood. Toronto is severely lacking places that serve fresh seafood. Buster's Sea Cove merrily fills that gap with their wide selection of seafood offerings.  I once ordered the swordfish sandwich and another time I ordered the grilled Octopus. The swordfish sandwich has my thumbs up. The grilled octopus was also very delicious. The nice thing with Buster's is that their food is fresh. There's a great difference between fresh seafood and frozen seafood.   My only gripe with this place are the prices. Located in St Lawrence Market, it's in a premium location and the prices reflect that. The swordfish sandwich with fries came out to be almost $15 after tax. The grilled octopus was disappointingly small in portion. It cost $15 + tax. It had only 2 Octopus tentacles. At Messini, they sell grilled Octopus for 50% cheaper ($10) and has 3 tentacles instead. Unfortunately there are not many stores with the same offerings as Buster's Sea Cove. There's Fish Sandwich store on College st but that's a little different."}
{"text":"Very disappointing - I've been wanting to check this place out for the longest time! Arrive early (before 12 if you can) to beat the lunch rush. The line moves relatively quickly and there are people taking your order.  My friend wanted something light and opted for the lobster bisque. DON'T get this guys! It tasted more like a tomato soup with very little pieces of lobster and overly seasoned pepper.   I on the other hand had the swordfish on a bed of salad. It was very impressive on first glance, as they stuff it full in a large take out container. However as you eat you realized it was just 3 pieces of paper thin sword fish on a giant salad. The ratio was probably 1 bite of swordfish to 10 bite of salad. You realized you just dropped $16 on this giant salad you could get at Costco."}
{"text":"I went to eat at Buster's Sea Cove at St. Lawrence Market  this past Sat! I ordered the \"halibut\" which clearly isnt! it was fishy and clearly not fresh fish let alone halibut! I stated to the owner I did not like it and wanted to return it he then started eating the fish from my container and said pick something else u cant have Ur money back! Then TOOK THE CONTAINER WITH FRIES STILL IN IT AFTER HE ATE ALL THE FISH LICKED HIS FINGERS AND TRIED TO PUT SHRIMP IN THE SAME CONTAINER HE JUST ATE OUT OF WITH THE SAME FRIES! this place should be shut down! after I said i wanted fresh fries he got enraged and touched another customers fish sandwich with the fingers he licked!!! SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN! in this age...HEp a b c TB common man your in the food industry! DISCUSTED! and I've put in a call to the Toronto health dept! DON'T EAT HERE PASS IT ON"}
{"text":"Excellent for freshly grilled or fried fish.  Their sides fries, coleslaw and green salad are very good--the onion rings mediocre way too thin and barely any onion.  The only item I would NOT recommend is the crab salad.  They use IMITATION crab meat??!! I cannot understand why a fresh fish market would use fake crab in a crab salad.  Also they should advertise that it is imitation crab seafood salad.  Buyer beware."}
{"text":"The line can be long, but I can't go through St. Lawrence Market without stopping by busters for a fish sandwich.  There are many other options on the menu including fried seafood and fried fish sandwiches, but I am partial to the grilled tilapia sandwich. Really tasted snack."}
{"text":"Nothing beats eating out of a lined checkered paper basket. Actually, it can get better. Fill it with fresh seafood or fish, grilled to a perfection, accompanied by a heaping portion of salad or fries. Top it off by finding a picnic bench outside, at the busiest market in Toronto - St Lawrence Market. I'm talking about Buster's. You can't miss it and shouldn't!  I've been eating at Buster's Sea Cove for the past five years and always try to visit the St Lawrence with an empty stomach. I've basically tried everything and haven't been disappointed yet. My favourite order isn't on the menu - Rainbow Trout with a side salad and coleslaw. I opt for the balsamic dressing instead of the raspberry. Make sure to get the red cream sauce for the fish - it is dip/spread/smother worthy. You'll find yourself scrapping the insides to just get an ounce more. BUT you really don't need the sauce. The grill man is a master. He gives you a meaty portion of fish/seafood and grilles it till the outsides are slightly charred but the inside; a buttery, melt in your mouth flaky piece of meat. He also drizzles a garlic, olive oil on top. The price isn't cheap, so be prepared to spend $14-16 dollars. it's mighty worth it once you see the portion size and taste the glory.   Buster's is best in the summer. I have a nostalgic feeling for the place. Every time I think of Buster's, I'm transported back to mid summer, my bike parked around the corner, wearing shorts, summer hair blowing in the wind, chowing down on a sizzling piece of fish with a view of the city around me. (Yes it's a parking lot and a few buildings, but I still love it). Just watch out for the pigeons.  Must Tries: Grilled calamari, Salmon, Rainbow Trout, Octopus, Tilapia and shrimp  ."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite seafood place in the city, everything is so fresh! I have been going here for years and I am always happy! My favourites are the Mahi Mahi, the swordfish sandwich and the shrimp poboy! Even their tuna sandwich is good! Everybody I have taken here always loves it! Their is always a huge portion of fries or salad accompanied with the main meal, you are sure to be full!  The atmosphere is rushed as it is in the St Lawrence market, so it's best to eat outside with your food in the summer.   I'd highly recommend Busters seacove to anybody looking for fresh fish!"}
{"text":"3.5 for me. I have tried Busters at St. Lawrence market so it was nice to see they opened a location close to work. I had the crab cakes with salad and they were pretty good! Lots of crab meat and good flavor. It was pricey though - $16 after tax...   The portions are okay, salad on the bland side. I would come back to try other items on the menu though."}
{"text":"Super overrated. Wa hyped to go here. Waited a solid 20 minutes for my food. My lobster roll was under seasoned. I think the lobster may have come from a can and cost me 20 bucks."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast this morning and ordered the egg benny with crab cake. Extremely disappointing as the crab cake tasted soggy. Lunch here is not bad such as the poy boy oyster sandwich.. but this breakfast and the egg benny really disappointed me!"}
{"text":"A seaside fish stand... in the middle of a food warehouse in Downtown Toronto.    One of the most popular lunch locations in St. Lawrence Market, there is always a line.  Everything I had was very fresh, but dishes can be hit or miss.    Lobster Bisque - I loved this.  It's very thick and creamy.  If you're looking for huge chunks of lobster meat, you won't get any.  It's more like a creamy salmon colored chowder.  The large bowl is generous portion.    Crab Cakes - These looked really enticing... crisp, crab meat mixed with diced red peppers to give it a mild kick.  Unfortunately, it was more filler than crab meat. I wasn't expecting jumbo lumps, just something inbetween.  It looks like it's full of crab meat, but each bite felt full of flour.  I like the red pepper flavor, but was disappointed at the meat content.    Grilled Whole Red Snapper - $22.  Grilled to a crisp on the outside, tender, juicy, and full of meat on the inside.  Slightly salted, served with a lemon and fried, browned onion strings on top.  A very solid and enjoyable dish.  It's not mind blowing.  Just a fish grilled the right way.  As my friend remarked... it could use a little more flavor.  But with fresh fish... better to be under-seasoned than over-seasoned.    If I'm in town again, I would eat here again.  Next time I'd probably stick to something simple, like fish and chips and the lobster bisque."}
{"text":"Amazing halibut and chips!  Perfect price for what you get, and what you get is a good quality meal!"}
{"text":"Seafood? I'm there!! I passed by this spot in the market with a friend and noticed the awesome sea-themed decor. It drew me in because of the long line which must mean it's good! The variety of the menu was impressive: gumbo/mussels/halibut/haddock and so much more! I decided on having fish and chips, to be exact I had haddock and chips. I was expecting greasy, but in fact it wasn't at all! It was still a bit of a heavy dish because of all the fries, but it really hit the spot.  Now let's talk  service.  It was absolutely incredibly efficient! During the wait in the line, there is \"waiter\" with headphones constantly communicating to the kitchen of what orders have been placed. He wasn't at all rude or stressed despite the crowded line.  It was the first time I ever saw a fast food place have such a service. It was fast and I got my meal in less than 5 minutes. Now that's fast food.   I say come here if you're into seafood, it will probably satisfy your seafood needs."}
{"text":"Had the calamari po boy sandwich, which was delicious. Shared some of a shrimp po boy. Which was also good too. Menu had a lot of great sounding seafood options. I was definitely full after eating."}
{"text":"\"chips\" were soggy, greasy, lukewarm, and very salty. Had to ask someone to clean our table. Overall, nothing to recommend to others with so many other options. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I have to say I rather love this place, the only downside is there is always a huge queue (in my experience) and seating it limited.  That said the grilled calamari is fantastic as is the seafood orzo, smelts, fried calamari, fish sandwiches, grilled swordfish.  I have read other reviews and people complaining about the salad etc, I have eaten here on several occassions and have never had cause to complain.  The staff are friendly and fast.  It's not that cheap $15 ish for the orzo but damn it is good! Everything is cooked to order while you wait, thus the queue! Most definately worth the wait and the reason why I like to frequent the market.  Sitting outside the market with some good food from buster's = bliss!  Just watch out for those damned pesky birds :D"}
{"text":"Amazing seafood! Worth the line-up. Have tried the lobster roll and fish tacos but I always go for either the crab cakes alone or in a sandwich. It's a huge sandwich so you don't really need the fries that come with it but I always eat them anyways."}
{"text":"Crab cake sandwich!  Yum!  My only complaint is that they seem to par-cook some of the seafood to speed up service because this place gets busy at lunch. Go early to avoid the noon hour crush of office workers."}
{"text":"My first time at St Lawrence Market and I was not sure what to eat. There was a long line at Buster's (located at the back of the market) so I assumed it had to be good. I got the grilled tilapia sandwich with side salad at the cashier's suggestion. Fish was moist and good quality but since fish is generally bland, I wanted a little more flavor. I saw a few people get the full salad options and New England clam chowder and hope to try those items next time."}
{"text":"It's hard to not love something that someone you love has fond memories of, but unfortunately Buster's wasn't up to snuff. Though Buster's looks better than some of the other food stalls in St. Lawrence Market, that's about all it was better at, looking.   We ordered a grilled swordfish salad, calamari Po Boy & fries and the whole meal had me craving some better real food. The swordfish had potential, but was over grilled and covered in oil, the Calamari was far too chewy and tasted like it came out of the freezer, not fresh as you would expect from a seafood shop and the fries left something to be desired (salt!!)  Unfortunately, I'll let this place live on in my boyfriend's childhood memories, but will not be coming back here with him unless something gives."}
{"text":"Just went again this weekend and had the swordfish sandwich.  Now I am not sure if the price changed or what but I remembered the tilapia costing $10 and the swordfish costing $12 approx. but it came out to $8.95 plus taxes, so $10 for the swordfish!!!  Well I had to add this in because this is a great deal.  It's fresh, it's good and that's a sweet price. :)"}
{"text":"This location is really substandard compared to their food truck. The lobster roll in particular is not at all done well. The food truck butters and grills/presses the bun, then fills it with the lobster mix, and it's awesome. This bremner location maybe just slightly butters and heats the bun, doesn't properly butter and press it like the truck, then they squirt a HUGE amount of this gross chipotle mayo on the bun so you can't taste the lobster at all...sometimes I forget to ask them not to put it on. Lobster rolls don't have chipotle mayo on them, so I don't know why they do this when nobody else does it, including their own other locations!  Also, the customer service is terrible. They only sell the lobster roll with fries or a salad. The fries are terrible, tasteless and overcooked, and they give you a huge mountain of them. The salads are mediocre and tiny in comparison, and come in this minuscule takeout container where if you try to mix in the dressing you spill almost all of the salad out of it and have to throw it all out. What a waste--I always throw the fries/salad straight in the trash. The prices they charge are insanely high, you'd think it was diamond encrusted...much more economical at the food truck with the bag of chips that aren't gross and which you can save for later.  They really need to start selling the lobster roll NOT in a combo, because most people don't want it in a combo. Do that, and actually prepare the bun properly instead of rushing and just throwing junk at your customers, and don't put that nasty sauce in it, and bam, automatic 5 star review. Why don't they just call the buster's food truck--their coworkers--and ask them to come and retrain all of the staff at this location? Boggles the mind..."}
{"text":"The busiest stall in the market, but it's just a short wait to get your food. Great mahi mahi sandwich on a grilled bun, and good onion rings too. Clam chowder was ok. Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Busters is located near Union station in the Southcore financial tower new second level food court.  I had lunch here the other day and although the lines may seem long and intimidating, it went very quick.  The lobster/seafood bisque was delicious! But was too expensive for just soup at almost $8 after tax.  Also had the shrimp po boy with fries, this was around $11 after tax. Kinda pricy for four pieces of battered shrimp in a sub sandwich. Tasted alright though. Fries were the skinny shoestring but crispy type which were pretty good.  After buying a drink, it was over $20 for a food court meal. Food was solid though. Good place for a lunch when you are nearby and want to splurge."}
{"text":"This place is gem and one of the best places to eat in the city. Don't be put off by a long line, these guys are able to get you taken care of efficiently."}
{"text":"There's always a huge line-up during the lunch time for Buster's Sea Cove. It's a quick and fresh grab if you're itching for some seafood. I had the salmon sandwhich and it was very well-done. Will definitely come here more often in the future when I have the time! Their french fries are also very very good - grab some mayo with them if you could!"}
{"text":"They tell us not to make excuses but I would always make excuses to visit St. Lawrence Market and pig out at Buster's Sea Cove. During the summer, me and my crew would order a plethora of seafood (calamari and po' boys for me!), sit outside, and straight up chill.   Some things seem to have changed this year. The line ups have always been long and the person who takes your order is always grumpy towards indecisive people, but the food suddenly became mediocre to me.   Weekly trips to the market turned into months. I can't really put my finger on it but it just ain't what it used to be. I'll definitely be back but won't ever being making special trips to the establishment anymore.   Don't get me wrong, do visit if you've never been because this is a very popular place, but just don't lose site of all the other stalls with great food at St. Lawrence.   Tip: cash only, seating area indoors is limited and I don't recommend sitting in the same area because there are just too many hungry people watching you eat as they're in the line up. The doors to the left of the stall will lead you to an outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to grab a bite here while checking out St. Lawrence market. We got the crab cakes with salad and spicy steamed mussels. They had a huge line up, crab cakes came pretty quick but the mussels took quite awhile. I don't think they were worth that wait. Mussles were cooked in an ordinary tomato sauce that was quite bland. It came with a garlic bread that was mediocre. The crab cakes were very heavy and a bit salty. They were very generous with the salad. All in all probably won't go back. Nothing all that special."}
{"text":"Po Boy sandwich was great. Batter on halibut was too thick, as mentioned in previous reviews. Grill trout with fries was alright, I wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"Not cheap15+ Long line up, but worth the wait, food is fresh and hot, I like it bec it skip the process of pulling on a big empty plate and let it grow old and cold. Would be even better if there no line up and more table to sit"}
{"text":"Undeserved hype.  I went with a friend for lunch.  She had the sword fish and I had the salmon.  It was alright, but not spectacular. The mains to sides ratio was a bit high.  Good place if you like crowds and hype."}
{"text":"Honestly, I came to this place because I love Calamari and it has a lot of good reviews.. HOWEVER, I tried the grilled calamari and was very disappointed.  Extremely chewy with no end, flavorLESS, the sauce they told me that goes great with it just tasted like plain oil thrown on my food.. just didn't enjoy any of it.  I will come back though to try something else because the reviews are just too many to write off this place as a disappointment, but for now, I wasn't happy with what I got... grilled calamari SUCKED."}
{"text":"I really think Buster's has one of the best lobster rolls in Toronto! It's filled with tons of lobster with the right amount of mayo/sauce and their rolls are always crispy and buttered appropriately! Their coleslaw could be creamier but love that you get to choose salad or fries!   Tried the clam chowder today for the first time; although people do say the small $5 isn't worth the price but it really is. It's filling and not too heavy with chunks of ingredients. Mm so good!  I wish Buster's had their own restaurant separate from the St. Lawrence Market as it gets super busy and crowded in there/near Buster's where you order/pick up your food. But it makes for a great meal and trip to the market!"}
{"text":"Although the lobster roll isn't hot & buttery i have to admit it was very good...fresh lobster, chipotle mayo, green onion, red pepper with fresh lemon on the top. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Visited busters sea cove at the Yorkdale pop up concept. I ordered the lobster roll and it was very tasty. The bun was toasted with butter which made much more tasty. The filling was a bit too much for me and tasted a bit bland. Otherwise it was a really nice, satisfying bite and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Terrible experience and mediocre food. The line up was long but I trusted that it would go quickly from reading other reviews. I put in my order in advance while waiting, paid my money and then waited...and waited... And waited. It was literally ONE HOUR from the time stamp on my bill to when I got my order of fried calamari. Meanwhile waiting in the humid, cramped, seating area whilst the staff shouted out orders and reminded the crowd of people to move down... I lost my appetite by the time the food finally arrived. We ate through the box of tasteless (but tender) calamari to be greeted with a huge POOL of oil at the bottom. So gross. But hey, the marinara sauce was good.  Someone needs to open a seafood restaurant in SLM so we have another option other than this place."}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 stars if I could, but I don't think this place was near a four star.   Seeing that this place was listed as a definite hot spot for 'Fish n Chips', I decided I definitely had to try this place among the other delicious options available at St. Lawrence Market. Sadly, I kind of wished I tried the other options available over this place.   It might have been because I ordered near closing time, about a half hour from closing so perhaps they didn't really cook or serve their food with the same effort they would had it been an earlier hour. I ordered the 'Boston Fish n Chips' at 9.95 and the 'Crab Cakes' at 13.95. The Crab Cakes were a total rip off, it was just two small cakes on top of a pile of fries. However, the Fish n Chips portion was HUGE. It's fairly enough to share between two people since they chuck a huge pile of fries with you along with three strips of fish.   The breading on the fish was light, but I wished it was more crispy and a little thicker wouldn't hurt for my taste preferences. The tartar sauce it came with however is absolutely delicious. The difference was that they added onion for that extra kick, it's going to be a while before I find a tartar sauce that tops theirs! The fries were pretty average, they were thin cut and weren't very crispy, slightly soggy even. The coleslaw was rather watery, it didn't really taste like much but it was refreshing in comparison to the completely fried meal.   I've never had a Crab Cake so I don't really know what it should taste like, but it was really dense and similar to batter. The texture was like tuna salad but more dense, I didn't really taste much crab in it. It was a lot of spices in it and I didn't feel much of seafood coming from it, I personally didn't like it. Also, at a price of 13.95? Definitely not again.   Overall, I think I can find better places for 'Fish N Chips' at a lower cost in the downtown area and even uptown. Also, given the environment that this place operates in, I would much rather sample the other tempting vendors available over this place. I probably wouldn't come here again due to the price and average food."}
{"text":"Overall a decent choice for seafood, but not the best!   Haddock and chips- I was a bit disappointed by the portion of fish when I fist opened my box but was pleasantly surprised at how meaty the fish ended up being. I just wish the breading on the fish was a bit crispier, it resembled the breading you get with frozen fish and chips from the grocery store!  It was served with a heaping serving of fries which tastes great with their creamy coleslaw. (4.5/5)  Octopus on salad- big disappointment. The octopus was burnt and was charred through the sides, making it difficult to bite and very unpalatable! The meat was over cooked and tough as expected seeing how it was burnt. The salad was nothing special, typical garden salad with a few cherry tomatoes. (2/5)   Based on the two items we tried, I would recommend sticking to the traditional fish and chips and steer away from the other seafoods! They are so busy that I think it causes their cooking quality to suffer, which is a disappointment."}
{"text":"It's in the back corner and I wasn't familiar enough with the market to find it quickly. By the time I found this place, I had almost filled my stomach with other goodies from the market. Therefore, I opted for the lobster bisque, which was smooth and creamy without being too rich. It was great as a cold bisque and amazing company as I stared forlornly at the steamed mussels that others were able to experience."}
{"text":"Great food overall but relatively pricy for what you get.  The lobster roll, crab cake sandwiches are good. The fish and chips, and calamari however were fishy and not that great.  Still recommended but avoid the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Yawn. The fried haddock on my fish and chip plate was good, but everything else was sorely disappointing: bland and soggy coleslaw, soggy fries, back-asswards ordering/queuing system. This place caters to tourists and definitely tastes like it.   First, the fried haddock. The fish was fresh and firm, but the breading (though light) was on the oily side. Unfortunately, the fried wish was laying on a bed of of sad, soggy, oily french fries. Most of the fries were bits and small pieces, so obviously they gave me the bottom of the chip fryer. TOTAL FAIL. Also, the coleslaw? Why bother? Tasted like shredded cabbage dressed with water and salt.   The lobster bisque was pretty decent, though I prefer bisque to be a little more richer and buttery-er.   While the service is fast, the way they have their queuing is awkward at best. They want you to order at a specific place at the counter, but when the line gets long (as it usually does), they want you to snake backwards toward the tables in front of the cash. Then, when you finish paying, you have to make your way to the right of the cash register (where you have to navigate between full tables and other people waiting to order/pay). Why not just let the line naturally wrap alongside the counter? Or, place the cash register on far right side instead of the far left? The way it is now just leads to chaos.   Anyway. Buster's Sea Cove is a big bust and not worth a second visit; there are other places with better food within St. Lawrence Market."}
{"text":"Found this little gem when I was strolling around Yorkville last week. Been here 3 times within a week. I wanted to get red snapper but they were out the first two times and I ended up getting grilled Rainbow Trout and Halibut sandwiches. Finally got to try the red snapper the other day and it was delicious. They don't cheap out on the fish and the coleslaw on the side is not too shabby either. It's a little bit oily for everyday meal but I can't complain considering the taste. Must try."}
{"text":"Although a little pricey, the food quality is amazing. I ordered the battered halibut with fries and was impressed with how fresh it was. They have a large selection of fishes (both battered and grilled) that you can order and they do it on the spot.  There isn't much seating so you'll mainly be doing take out. Regardless, its a spot you have to try whenever you visit St. Lawrence market."}
{"text":"Looking for fresh seafood at the St. Lawrence market. Found Buster's at the end of the market filled with long lines. Ordered the lobster roll and halibut & chips. Took 40 mins to make. Seating is limited to 5 tables. Food was dry and not fresh. Lobster was extremely dry, call it lobster smash. The halibut was also dry b/c it was frozen. Fries were oily. The pickle was the only enjoyable component. Save your money and your stomach. $33 is way over priced ($15 for lobster roll and $14 for halibut + tax). Go downstairs for more food options."}
{"text":"Once I realized this place was steps away from where I worked part time, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the hype was about and my oh my am I glad I did.   The halibut sandwich is by far the best sandwich I have ever had! It's got the perfect ratio of bread to fish to toppings. There is also a good amount of fish so every bite has a bit of everything. The coleslaw adds as a nice crunchy side too. I'm salivating thinking about it right now lol I also really enjoyed their halibut fish and chips as well. The fries are delicious and crispy.   Unfortunately I haven't really tried much else on the menu, except for the haddock sandwich which was breaded instead of battered. I'm a batter gal so the halibut sandwich still reigns supreme. I always come with the intention of getting something new but the halibut sandwich always draws me...  There's a green p parking garage (not street or surface lot - those are more expensive) close by on the esplanade that 's only $2!!!"}
{"text":"Anyone who's been to St Lawrence Market during lunch hour will be familiar with the long lineups in front of Busters.  After reading some favourable reviews we decide to give this place a try.   We had the halibut and chips and the shrimp po boy.  When we got our order we thought they had made a mistake. The fish and chips consisted of three small fingerling pieces of halibut that had a batter coating resembling something you'd expect from a frozen pack of Captain Highliner.  Definitely NOT pub style here. The shrimp po boy had several nicely sized coated and deep fried shrimp. Best part was unfortunately the panini grilled bun.  Overall the 'flavour' of the whole meal was bland. In particular the po boy could have used more than a simple mayo, tomato, and lettuce condiment. It's ok for a quick bite but if you crave good fish and chips look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Earlier this year I attended a food truck festival at Mississauga's Celebration Square and I just couldn't say no to what I saw on their menu. LOBSTER ROLL.   I liked it enough for me to visit their restaurant in downtown Toronto at the St. Lawrence Market for a second shot.   This time I tired their grilled swordfish and calamari Again I was mindblown. The swordfish was cooked very tenderly, wasn't dry, but nor was it overpowered with seasoning. Portions were generous, I was full in the end. The only downside is the price - although totally worth it.     My old regret was I should have taken more pictures."}
{"text":"I ordered the lobster roll (~$15 after tax) because I heard it might be better than fresh off the boat's version.   Buster's version has about the same amount of lobster but I tasted a variety of different herbs that complimented the lobster. So taste-wise, buster's lobster roll wins.  Fresh off the boat's version is a little bland but still refreshing."}
{"text":"I had such a nice fried halibut sandwich with chips from this place.   Even if there is a bit of a queue, don't worry! We came here in the lunch-time rush hour, but it didn't take them long to zoom through the line to give everyone delicious looking fish!  I am normally not very keen on coleslaw, but their version is not too mayonnaise-y so I really enjoyed it.   If I lived in Toronto I'd definitely be back to try more of their seafood!"}
{"text":"I love my seafood stopped off on break from work...staff is friendly ..food is great I got an order of calamari and chicken n shrimp gumbo...huge order of calamari and the gumbo was packed with shrimp n chicken ...will be back multiple times ..ps line much shorter than st lawrence market"}
{"text":"Wowwww!!  With the high ratings my expectations were high. Somehow/someway this place surpassed them. It's nothing special location wise (inside st Lawrence market) but the delicious food was amazing!! Definitely will be returning. Keep up the good quality"}
{"text":"So, what can I say about Buster's? Hrm...long lines, lots of fish, lots of people, and prices that may cause you to do a double take. But...  It's worth it.  I had the seafood pie and the clam chowder from here and I will honestly say that I don't regret the $20 bill. Just mentally prepare yourself for the fact that the line moves quick, but the food is freshly prepared so there will be a bottleneck. Compound that with Busters being in the corner next to an Italian spot that gets plenty of traffic and you have a weekend nightmare. Go during the week if you can - crowd is non-existent then."}
{"text":"A few months ago, while sharing a peameal bacon sandwich at St. Lawrence Market with my other half, we noticed lots of people eating delicious looking seafood. \"Where did that come from?\" we said to each other, and made a note to remember to look for seafood on our next visit.  Last weekend we were back at the market for some shopping. Before we finished making our purchases, my stomach started growling and I remembered we had to look for seafood. Turns out the delicious looking seafood comes from Buster's.   First, the menu at Buster's is daunting. There are actually two menus. Not feeling the sandwich love (I'm sure they're good, and there are lots to choose from) and figuring we would split something, we perused the grilled fish menu. Again, lots to choose from. The two of us split the grilled calamari with fries (you can replace fries with salad) and it was a big heaping portion for about $13. I can't imagine eating it myself! The grilled calamari was pretty good. A little chewy but tasty. The fries were way too greasy for my liking. They were so greasy they were wet.  I will definitely go back to try the other seafood on offer, but next time I'll get a salad on the side.  The staff, for being worked so hard - this place is popular! - is really nice. Hard to get a seat. Try outside, and around the corner."}
{"text":"So you are walking around St Lawrence market, and its going to happen.... you are going to be absolutely starving from sensory overload of food. It's everywhere all around you and you can't possibably decide what to eat so what do you do. What I did was looked to where there was a HERD of humanity all gathered around this sea food place.... asked the server what was most popular there (Pickrel and Chips), order up and dig in.   It was ovbiously very fresh as you could find vendors selling the darn fish fresh about 10 meters away, awesome tartar sauce (if your into that kind of thing) and nice crispy well seasoned french fries which i liberally dosed with malt vinegar.  Is it just me or does any place that tends to use newspaper as the wrapping around a fish and chips, almost 95% of the time, awesome? Well.... they do it good here, and how can you fail when you have so much product around you.... for reals.... EAT AT THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This is all about the octopus. Thick meaty slabs that you swear are still twitching. Fried beautifully with a peppery kick, they are the standard for seafood takeout.. Sided with some amazing cherry tomatoes, it's a nice refreshing acid kick to take the sharp pepper edge off.   I'd be giving this 5 stars but they use peanut oil in their deep fryer.  Who does this anymore?"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood but stingy on the quantity.... It's an interesting concept where they make your seafood to order.. I had the pasta w shrimp and my friend had the fried oysters... Not bad at all but the portions were small."}
{"text":"Okay do not get me wrong this place was one of the many places I wanted to go and eat at. I had high expectation of the quality of the food. It is in the St. Lawrence markets so a little bit crowded but that is what a market is! Anyways I ordered the lobster roll with the house salad. I was v excited to take my first bite until...I saw a curly hair on my pickle. I was so disgusted and kinda ruins my appetite. I wanted to complain but the line was too long and too crowded. I just removed the pickle and ate the lobster roll. It was pretty good with the fresh house salad but with the thought of the hair just didn't do it justice. Therefore I will sadly give this a low rating. I mean people make mistakes but as a customer it just makes you want to gag a lil. Maybe I will go again but I will prob try something else.   Tip: if you do go check the food first"}
{"text":"This review is for the Market location only. I really really wanted to fall in love with this place like everyone else. After 3 tries, I must say I need to just give up trying.  Had grilled calamari before - found it tasteless, came with a soggy salad. Then had a teeny-tiny lobster roll - wasn't horrible but nothing to write home about. Just had their grilled mahi mahi with onion rings. Maybe I am not a mahi mahi fan? However, I found the fish to lack any flavour whatsoever and it was also extremely overcooked and dry. I kept watching the guy grilling it forever as about 5 orders which were placed after me, were ready to go. I was wondering what was taking so long.  Prices are, well, Toronto prices.   Service is friendly for the most part. Depends who you get and how busy they are too, it may be a little short, which is understandable I suppose  I am going to try their foodtruck maybe for some fish tacos next time, but I am definitely done with this place."}
{"text":"I've been here before a couple times already, and really appreciate how much they put into their sandwiches and po'boys, but the fried food i got was extremely lacking that i had to go to St. Urbain to grab a bagel lox to compensate.  First off, this wasn't what I originally ordered. I ordered a crawfish po'boy but the dude told me it was sold out. Fair enough, i got the clam strips instead.   I got my food and opened it up and saw that there were barely any clams. When i ate my clams it was as of they covered it with so much batter that you could barely tell it was even clams. It looks like chicken tenders to be honest.  On top of that, the same dude was insisting he was right when a customer complained that his mussels was really bad and had a smell to it. The cashier dude was so rude, and insisted that he knew what he was doing. Just really bad vibes!"}
{"text":"I love Buster's Sea Cove...too bad they don't have another location uptown and this is the only place you can delish seafood without breaking your bank...  Inside St. Lawrence Market (known as the World's greatest food market) where you can find the freshest veggies, fruits, seafoods and meats...you can always come and drop by here for lunch..there is ALWAYS a line...I know..but it is well worth the wait...  You can stuff yourself full with the lobster roll which has alot of lobster pieces in it and a salad and/or fries...depends on your choice...I always order the salad and the portions are HUMUNGOUS..which I always have a hard time finish...I would be stuffing my face if I could finish 1/4 of the salad after the lobster roll..  I've tried their fish, lobster roll, lobster bisque..yet to try their calamari since it looks soo good..everything I've tried I've been very happy and satisfied with so I have to give them a 4*...  Although the line is long, Yes, we all know, it moves quite fast and their system just works for them well...lunch works out to be around $15-20 which may be on the pricey end,,,but unless you splurge yourself everyday...I personally think it is acceptable..  All in all, I have no complaints and can't wait to come back..."}
{"text":"I walked into the St. Lawrence Market for the Buster's Sea Cove food court area. I had the Mahi Mahi sandwich and the fish was good! Wish there was a little more seasoning and a little less oil but it was definitely delicious! :)   Would recomment the Calamari or Octopus ! I'm going to be trying the Tuna Melt next time since everyone was talking about it. Not to mention the Lobster sandwich!"}
{"text":"That is some fantastic seafood. Just make sure you go there mid-afternoon on a weekday, otherwise the lines are long! But even then, it's well worth it! Every single dish and sandwich is amazing and the freshly cut fries are delicious."}
{"text":"Now this is what I expect from a seafood place. Very down to earth and fresh from the sea. I always order the halibut and fries or halibut and salad (depending on how healthy I want to be). The fish is done great and makes for one filling meal perfect for lunch. The patio on the back side of St. Lawrence is a great place for summer evenings. The only downside is the long wait and that you smell like a fisherman when you get back to work"}
{"text":"A-OK... bit pricey... quick service.. food was ok... sorry.. not much more to say... i'll keep you posted when i try the next item..."}
{"text":"Dammit, the cole slaw was hidden below,  Didn't grab a fork, now got veg on my elbow!"}
{"text":"The Cove used to be one of my favourite restaurants in St. Lawrence Market. It's grown quite a lot over the years and now they have a food truck.  I ordered a fish taco and a shrimp taco (2 for $10). I recommend the shrimp taco, it had more flavour, it was crispy and they were bigger chunks. The Lobster Roll came with a pickle and Miss Vickies chips ($14).  It was good as usual, but could be a better value for that price."}
{"text":"Best seafood grub you'll find in toronto. well.. atleast in this yelper's humble opinion. =)  It's located at the southern most end of the St. Lawrence Market,  so during lunch hours, just look for that big line up. They are experts at handling large line ups and multi tasking. Their food is amazing and cooked with so much flavour!   I always order the grilled octopus served with their fries and coslaw. I have also had their amazing tuna melt. Fish and chips are without a doubt delicious and never over done! The fish is always still moist, and thick, so you don't just get some fried breading and bits of fish. =)   Their dishes are very much priced perfectly. You get exactly what you paid for and more. Quality always improves here and you always get a big bite of fish/ seafood. Big portions, prepared very well.  If I worked near by, I would be there every day. haha!"}
{"text":"I finally had an opportunity to check out Buster's Sea Cove.  Every time I've come to St. Lawrence market the line up for the Cove has been down the aisle.  I've had little bites at the St Lawrence Market Night at the Evening the last couple of years, but it was really the lobster roll that I've wanted to try.    My boyfriend and I wanted a snack and the lineup wasn't too long so we split a lobster roll meal with fries.  I loved the fries.  They were my favourite kind, shoestring.  The buttery garlic bread tasted freshly baked.  The filling of the lobster roll was okay.  It was clearly fresh lobster, and had a lot of flavour.  Everything was kind of mushy, I wish there were more lobster chunks.  There were a couple of chunks on top, but I would have preferred them mixed in.  I've only had a couple of lobster rolls in my life.  While this one was good, I prefered the one from Lbs.  That being said, this was a good roll.  I'm thinking maybe I just don't like lobster rolls lol.    Anyway, I'm still giving a 4 star b/c the service was enthusiastic, friendly, fast and the food was really fresh.  I look forward to coming back and trying something else.  I have my eye on a fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Place is good, I always get the shrimp po boy.  It's a bit salty and I've asked if they add salt after it's fried but I was told they don't.  Despite that, there's a nice crunchy coleslaw with it.  Bun is toasted with a panini press so you get grill lines!  The fries are not bad.  Make sure you bring lots of money because this place is very expensive.  $10 plus taxes for just the sandwich, fries and a drink will cost you a fortune!"}
{"text":"Lobster roll was decent, nothing special though. Salad that came with it wasn't great."}
{"text":"BSC lacks consistency. Crab cakes can differ in taste depending on when you order it. One day you taste the crab, other days you taste all the fillers.  Same thing goes with their halibut sandwich. One day its crisp, other times its oily and soggy.  The amount of sides also differ depending on who's serving that day. One day you get a generous amount of coleslaw, other days you only get a fraction of it.   Fried calamari always on point though :)  Lines are long during the lunch hour but you get served pretty quickly. Still on the fence so I'll give it 3 stars for now since I plan to return."}
{"text":"So good! I wish I took a picture of the beauty before devouring it.  I ordered the Shrimp Po'Boy and was pleasantly surprised!  The shrimp was well seasoned and not overly breaded, the veggies and sauces really tasted great alongside the herby flat(ish) bread. The only thing that was lacking, in my opinion at least, was that coleslaw. But that's just relative to the BOMB sandwich.  I had it to-go, and they packed it with a newspaper-looking thing and I just fell in love. So charming!  Anyways, a tip would be to be wary of the calories (if you're a counter)! This place has been bashed by the Star for having 800+ calories for just a salmon sandwich. Their recommendation would be to ask for the calorie-laden sauces on the side so you can apply them as needed, which isn't a bad idea!"}
{"text":"Had numerous opportunities to try these guys but never took advantage until this weekend. Saw them at the St. Lawrence market once and actually got a chance this weekend at the Richmond Hill Food Truck festival where they had their truck with a great amount of seafood items.  Great looking truck. Vibrant colours and hues that really fit with the brand and to be honest a menu that looks very, very appetizing. big truck overall and they service the orders very quickly.  food: had the 3 tacos for $15 and had the haddock, shrimp and ahi tuna. each taco came on a soft tortilla with fresh Pico and sauce. the fish was crispy and fresh with a little lime wedge to really provide that acidity you want when having fish tacos.  So happy with the freshness and the crunch that I went back for a second order of haddock. they loaded it full. Very happy to have eaten from these guys and would be happy to recommend and go again.  4.0 out of 5.0 all day."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best seafood in Toronto! We usually get here super early to avoid the line. Always ask what they recommend that day and you can't go wrong! I always get the fish grilled with a side of cole slaw and fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"Not great. Had the lobster roll and crab cakes. DO NOT GET THE CRAB CAKES. They are expensive and taste like 99% filling and maybe 1% crab. Very underwhelming for a $17 plate. The lobster roll was decent and not too much mayo but not a standout."}
{"text":"Something different if you find yourself down at the market for lunch. Fish was tasty and batter was on point. Not a bad price either for fish n chips. Lineup was crazy long but it took mere minutes to get my food. Quite an operation and gets busy quick at noon."}
{"text":"Every time I go to St. Lawrence Market, I attempt to go to Buster's Sea Cove but the lineup and wait is always so long. I was so glad to see this location on Yonge St., near Davenport!  I had the crab cakes with fries and my friend had the clam chowder. He enjoyed it and said it had a very good flavour.  My crab cakes tasted okay but there was something about the texture that I didn't care for. It was a bit too creamy compared to what I'm used to in a crab cake, kinda like mashed potatoes. I would have preferred less filler and more crab. Maybe that's just my taste. I'm not sure I would order this again but I'd like to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Grilled swordfish sandwich? YES PLEASE."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment, I end up leaving most of the plate .... I ordered the crab cake plate (which they marked as crowd favorites but guess I was wrong...)   The portion is good, but the taste is such a no no! Just way too salty, both the crab cakes and the fries... no other tastes at all except for salty...   I also ordered the chowder soup, it was ok... but the chowders inside are definite not too good (not sure, just not my type, too harsh and no taste of seafood) and it's a bit salty too...  So yeah overall, I don't recommend this place, just not yum and the price is not that cheap too..."}
{"text":"had 2 things. fried calamari with fries + lobster bisque. fried calamari with fries, it LOOKED good + tasty, but there was ZERO flavor.  none. nada. zilch. the lobster bisque on the other hand, was salty, that's all I was able to taste. so eventually I ended up dipping the super bland fried calamari + fries into the bisque as if it were a sauce to eat.  as much as I like seafood, I don't think I would be returning to eat here."}
{"text":"This review is for the food truck.  I bought a duel taco ($12) from Buster's food truck yesterday.  The menu said that the haddock was battered.  It depends on what you like.  If you like a crunch in the fish filet, you are forewarned here that there was none.  If you prefer grilled fish fillet, which I do, you will be delighted that the batter was thin and was there to form a shell per se to hold the fish together for searing.  The haddock itself was big; its diameter was about the size of a 25 cent coin.  The fish was very fresh as well.  I also had an octopus taco.  It was fresh and not over-cooked.  The corn tortilla was stale. The garnishment was an in-house chilli mix.   These tacos are good street food, as tacos are meant to be.  The rating could be higher if the tortilla is better."}
{"text":"ordered lobster rolls (small and nothing special for the price), crab cakes were slightly burned, soggy calamary, and to top it all they take US $ 1÷1 which meant we paid $12 extra on our meal.. the lady on the cashier was very rude."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Location: 4/5   Highlight: BEST QUALITY food court meal I've ever had. Buster's is a quick, fresh, and undeniably delicious choice for all you seafood lovers out there.   I've been to the famed Buster's Sea Cove at St.Lawrence market and liked it, so I was excited to hear that they had opened up in the food court of 120 Bremner. This iteration of Buster's is starkly different than the modest hustle and bustle of its food truck and market counterparts. It sits in the middle of a brightly lit, modern food court - all straight edges of marble and glass, drawing a strong crowd during the lunch hour rush.   I ordered an ahi tuna taco ($5) and a New England clam chowder ($5.50). Even with the big line-up, my order was filled swiftly. The taco was incredible- albeit a bit messy and leaky to handle! Two layers of soft tortillas cradling crunchy coleslaw and several slices of perfectly seared pink ahi tuna on top. The taco was topped with a mildly spicy, but incredibly fresh salsa and served with a wedge of lime. LOVED IT! As always, the spice and seafood flavours were cut perfectly with a citrus splash from the lime. The tacos are small, but worth every penny. On the other hand, the soups were slightly disappointing in comparison. The clam chowder I had was nothing to write home about and my friend's lobster bisque was too salty on its own.   TIP:  Go for a couple tacos, skip on the soup."}
{"text":"They tack on a $0.25 fee if you pay by debit but they don't warn you prior to paying. I hate when any place does this without warning.   I ordered the halibut and chips. The fries were bland as they weren't seasoned at all. They didn't taste very fresh either. The coleslaw was alright but there wasn't much to remember about it. It did taste like it was freshly made though, as the slaw had a good crunch to it. I thought the halibut was a little bland on it's own but the sauce they serve with it made it better. I'd probably skip the halibut and chips if I were you."}
{"text":"Went to St. Lawrence Market for the first time and decided to stay for lunch with my boyfriend. We noticed the large crowd around Buster's and figured it must be a hit here so we chose to hop on the bandwagon. We each ordered a Halibut on a bun and an additional gumbo. The halibut met with our expectations and the gumbo was mediocre. Will definitely try out the surrounding restaurants on our next visit to the St. Lawrence Market"}
{"text":"This was a disappointment.  You'd think with the kind of consistent line ups you see out front of this spot that everything would be outstanding.  Sadly, a friend and I found this to be untrue.  They mean well, that is clear, with a young girl on a head set going up and down the line to get the orders of people waiting, presumably so you don't have to wait that long for your food once you eventually get up to the front.  However, we did.  My friend and I both ordered the classic Haddock and Chips thinking that this place would do it up right.  Young-head-set-girl recommended it.  We ordered at the same time so we found it strange that I got my food but then she had to wait another 5 minutes or so.  They seemed pretty harried and sort of confused behind the line.  Not sure if that's the norm. All the same, we didn't have much time for lunch so it was a little annoying.  Portions were huge!  We each got 4 pieces of fish (cornmeal breading... disappointing) and probably a half pound of heavy greasy fries.  Some of my fish was dry and over cooked, tartar sauce was just mayo with a couple bits of pickle in it, coleslaw was underdressed.  Maybe we just didn't order the right dish?  Seriously though, you're a seafood restaurant and you can't do a solid fish n chips?  While waiting for our food I was eyeing some of the sandwiches going out.  They looked pretty tasty.  I'll probably give this spot another go just because the lines can't lie.  I'm thinking this may have been a fluke.  I'm hoping it was just a fluke.  Only two stars until they prove it."}
{"text":"Just dropped by for first time. Staff was super nice and the calamari po 'boy was excellent. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the crab cake and halibut & chips.  The fish and crab cake was small for the price.  They were pretty oily and the fries were not crispy at all.  The crab cake was pretty dense and the taste was rather blend."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since my last visit to the St. Lawrence market and I guess my memories of this place was that it was better than what we got today.    Don't let the long line up fool you, people.  The food here is quite below average.  We ordered halibut and chips (dry fish and soggy chips but good coleslaw) and a tuna melt (the fishest tuna melt I've ever had but the grilled sandwich had a nice crunch) and both dishes were just barely edible.    Next time, I'll just go downstairs to Moustachios."}
{"text":"Tried the lobster roll and crab cakes. The food was very good, however also very heavy. Both came with fries (or salad) and a small serving of coleslaw. Definitely come with your appetite!   Being inside St. Lawrence Market, there is minimal seating, however if the weather is nice there's seating right outside the stall. The line up is also always very long, but moves very quickly.  Definitely a must try during a day at the market."}
{"text":"This fish is swimming in grease! If you're looking for a tasty way of stopping your heart, this is an option. But if you're just looking for a good fish and chips, head to chippy's instead."}
{"text":"The line was looooong here, but the wait was worth the effort. We got a halibut on a bun and haddock on a bun. Both were delicious! I think the halibut was just a tinsy bit better, but to be honest, I was plenty happy with both.  They don't take credit here, so bring cash.  There is very limited seating here. Just go outside and find a seat.  The staff does seem a little impatient with some of the customers, but they were nice to us. To be honest, I can see why they seem impatient to some customers. They nicely asked people to step aside and look at the menu. When you're ready, you can step up and place an order. Yet some people still come up and then order, then they have a discussion with their friends/family, then change the order, then change it back, etc. That's *not* order when you know what you want...that's \"make people behind you wait needlessly while you're still indecisive\".  Someone complained that they had to use USD and were offended that this place used a 1:1 conversion. As an American, I have to say, it seems reasonable for stores to do that here. They shouldn't have to figure out what the current exchange rate is and/or negotiate the conversion rate with customers, then pay a fee for converting the money back to USD. But going beyond that, I can't think of too many stores in Toronto that do anything other than a 1:1 conversion. If it's really a big deal to Americans visiting the market, go withdraw money from an ATM. There are plenty of ATM machines around (http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/faqs).  But anyway, back to the food. I'd have to say the fish sandwiches are very good. The coleslaw it came with was just OK. But overall, I would definitely come back here again and try more of the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Delicious East Coast Lobster roll. The roll was crispy and light. The lobster was fresh and there was quite a bit of meat. I'd still say pricey at $15.00. But you can tour the market and snack on samples of other vendor goods to make up for it."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the seafood here, and as a seafood lover I am particularly picky about the freshness, but they are top-notch. I had the grilled calamari and a seafood orzo on two separate occasions. Highly recommended. Great for comfort food."}
{"text":"The first impression, it looks very busy, but fun because a lot of people lined up to order their food. It looked like everyone enjoy eating their food and seems like the 20-25 minutes from waiting to order and picking up the food was worth it!   Decor - St. Lawrence Market (Its an indoor Market, what do you expect?) Good place to walk through on the weekend and try random food =)  Food - Meh. The food was burnt and tasteless (Ordered Steamed Mussels with white wine and Seafood Gumbo)"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I go to St Lawrence location often for chowder. They know exactly how to prepare fish perfectly. I brought my Greek partner here for Calamari, and he said it was one of the best he's had. I was so excited to see they have a food truck now and multiple new locations scattered downtown. Yes! Now I don't have to go far for it."}
{"text":"While at the St. Lawrence Market on Day 1 of the trip, we walked by Busters.  It had a long line, which either meant it was incredibly delicious or that it was living on a reputation and people were in some sort of hypnotic state (like Zachary's pizza fans in the San Franciso Bay Area, IMO) for eating such average food.   So, the next day we decide to brave the line (we went early to avoid it) and put that to the test...and were excited by the outcome...it was delicious!  We had 4 different choices of fish for our fish 'n chips, and we went with Red Snapper.  Not a typical fish for that dish, but it was excellent!  The fries were meh, but the fish made it worth the experience.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So I went on a field trip today to the St. Lawrence, and my prof allowed us to eat at the St. Lawrence Market for lunch, a place I have not visited for 14 years. Sure enough, after an admirable experience with Buster's Sea Cove during the VELD Music Festival, I decided to go there again, especially after hearing great reviews.  I decided to get the grilled octopus after pressuring and recommendation from one of the employees. It came with either fries or salad (I went with caesar salad). I got about four BIG pieces of octopus on top of the caesar salad.  Portion wise I was definitely happy considering I paid a total of just over $18 with a drink, as I initially thought it would be a bit of a ripoff. In fact, I didn't even finish the salad, that's how filling it was. The octopus was definitely one of the best ones I've had ever, and it didn't even need to be fried, since fried stuff is usually tastier.  Will I come back? Oh hell yes, next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for fish & chips, and I knew the St. Lawrence Market would not disappoint me with their many vendors.  Buster's Sea Cove has a great menu of fresh fish, and though I was tempted by the $20 lobster roll, I ordered the Boston Blue Fish & Chips.  It is a bit pricey, but my meal was totally worth it.  I snapped open my can of San Pellegrino and dug into my piping hot fish.  The batter was perfectly crunchy and not super greasy, and the fish was moist and flaky.  The fish & chips are piled high atop fries and cole slaw, although I did not eat much of those.  The fish filets are more than enough for one person!  There's also a small seating area right across from Buster's.    Cash only.  I think they accept some form of Canadian debit though, which seems like the standard at St. Lawrence Market."}
{"text":"Favourite seafood place in Toronto! I was never disappointed during any of my visits. The seating area is limited but if it's nice outside there are patio benches too. Everything is reasonably affordable and all the food is freshly made in front of you.  Definitely a place to check out as a tourist or a local!"}
{"text":"The only item I ordered was the lobster roll and it was mediocre at best.  The lobster roll consisted primarily of minced lobster meat.  My idea of a lobster roll are the ones I've had in NYC and Provincetown, Massachusetts.  There are supposed to be large, discerrnable pieces of lobster meat in either a melted butter sauce or a mayonaise dressing.  Buster's lobster roll was like eating a tunafish sandwich with the meat almost minced beyond recognition.  If this is Toronto's idea of a good lobster roll then Torononians need to get out of town more."}
{"text":"I went to busters sea cove and had the chicken tenders with fries. Tenders didn't really have a taste and they were really dry. The presentation was not all that good. The price was good for how much chicken and fries they gave. Other than that the employees were friendly. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Buster's caught my eye from a far with the inviting presentation and the fresh seafood display. The prices for everything were affordable, and I chose the Halibut & Chips. It's was very fresh and hot, the batter of the fish had a nice crispy/crunchy texture but the fish was fence or too soft at all. The amount of fries given with meal was a little overwhelming but perfect for large appetites. The tartar sauce was just the right amount of creaminess that went well with the fish. Overall I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless you prefer quantity over quality."}
{"text":"I have been here twice once in their food truck I thought it was phenomenal. I had their po boys calamari it was off the chain they have other really delicous seafood items can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Long line at this food place... A girl was handing out menu down and line and relaying orders to the cooks(via a mic)  so by they time we slowly made our way to the cashier to pay,we didn't have to wait long for our fried fish sandwich. It's an  ok sandwich ,feel free to skip"}
{"text":"Prices have gone up since the time I came here like 2 years ago, their starting for fish and chips is $9 and I believe it's blue fish....me and my mom ordered the haddock n fries and the grilled Mahi Mahi   Big portions that really filled me up but the quality wasn't that great, maybe it was busy but I found their haddock similar to frozen highliner fish and chips....batter is not up to par with other well known fish n chip places in toronto like old ye fish and chip, wasn't crispy enough and their fish is so slim and unflavorful, fries are good tho  The grilled Mahi Mahi lacked flavor too and it was too chewy, felt it was overcooked...won't be coming back for while"}
{"text":"This new outpost of the St. Lawrence Market fave is a great option in Yorkville, which doesn't have a lot of restaurants with great value. Buster's Sea Cove has a great variety of options from classic fish and chips to grilled fish plates, salads, fish tacos, and sandwiches. Most things range from $10-15.   I had the grilled tilapia sandwich ($9) which tasted fresh, flavourful, and the portion was very generous. They don't skimp on the fish! I got the side salad (+$4), which was a pretty unexciting garden salad with balsamic vinaigrette. My DC had the fried calamari po boy with fries. Super  yummy and I really liked the fries too!   Fast, fresh, and friendly -- this is a good spot for a quick bite if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I saw the long line which gave me an indication that this place was good and popular. Service (guy who took my order) was abrupt and not too friendly. They recommended I get the fried swordfish sandwich.  I took one bit and regretted ordering the sandwich and fries. The fries were cold and soggy.  If you're not too hungry, I would skip this place and head over to a different seafood spot."}
{"text":"This was the busiest place in St Lawrence Market, no contest.  When we were deciding where to eat lunch, we figured a massive queue of hungry people were probably on to something, and gave it a go.  It isn't the cheapest, however, they have a very efficient system for taking all their orders and we didn't wait long for our food despite the ominous crowds.  My lobster roll was delicious, and I've paid more money for less lobster roll at other places (in NYC specifically, where I practically needed a magnifying glass to see my roll).  This one is stuffed with fresh, meaty lobster, and was the perfect summer lunch.  Fries were incredibly, comically abundant, and they weren't bad though not as crisp as I'd have liked.  The Greek salad was enormous and definitely for sharing, and built so it's easy to pick out whatever you don't like (there's always something in a Greek salad that someone doesn't like.  It's raw onions in my case).  There are a lot of goodies in this market, but you can't beat fresh seafood on a hot summer day.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times and had great experience each time enjoying calamari po boy, clam chowder and last visit had chicken and shrimp gumbo which were all very flavourful, lots of ingredients and balanced taste.  Makes you want to eat more and more.  The most recent time I went I had the fried Calamari on its own and it was a bit of a miss.  The calamari had great chewy texture but the batter felt a bit oily.  Tried to wash it off with tea and water after but still felt it on my tongue hours later.  My friend ordered shrimp taco which the batter was salty and it was so fried it was mostly black."}
{"text":"Honestly I felt their quality has gone down hill for the past few years. Their food is still good but it use to be much better. I personally like my coleslaw to be slightly more tangy, so I always ask for an extra piece of lemon. Their coleslaw is home made and it's fresh but I feel like it could use a touch more seasoning. The fries is pretty standard, no complaints there. As for the fish it's a good portion for the price. I ordered the lobster last time and I felt a little disappointed since it's such a small portion and there's hardly any lobster meat. The calamari we shared this time is tender and tasted fine.   Service can be iffy when they get busy but it's Understandable. Their lines can go in circles and everyone's just grumpy.   I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for their seafood but if I'm in the area it's a safe option."}
{"text":"If I could rate the customer service independently I would give them 4 stars. I know it's odd to rate the service so much higher than the food but there it is.  Preamble: My sweetie and I are closet fish eaters - vegetarians who step out every now and again for treats from the deep and we are uber fussy about the fish we are cheating with. For over 7 years we have been surreptitiously slipping in and out of the market for fresh tuna, halibut, mahi mahi, black cod ... we love fresh fish so much we are willing to forsake our vegetarian vows for a shot at romance with sole or sea bass or even the fugly monkfish. Just to be clear, we are afishionados!  Today was the day we decided to see what all the line ups and fuss was over at Busters. Always busy at lunch time we never had the patience to see for ourselves. We are long time patrons of Olde Yorke on Laird Dr and even the humble and homely Haimishes on Pharmacy Ave so we expected to add Busters to the fav list too.  Getting straight to it: halibut and chips x 2 = 30 bux ill spent :( we were warned that their batter was unique but if by unique you mean overly salty, insanely greasy and chewy like you want a good loaf of rye to be then yes it was unique. The halibut portion was, I want to say, microscopic but we could actually see the fish once we excavated the dense layer of dumpling like batter and the fruits of our archeolgical labor produced overcooked, freezer burned tasting lumps of white fish indistinguishable from the \"sea legs\" sold in Neptune salad at the grocery store.  The chips get 7/10 but were served haphazardly over a mound of cold, tasteless coleslaw. Potentially, the slaw had it been seasoned well and served away from the fries, would have been good. The brightest note belonged to the tarter sauce. Creamy and citrusy it made the grade and I don't care for tarter sauce.   Wrapping up this review (because the post Busters bloat is making it uncomfortable to sit at my iPad much longer and I know few readers will get this far) when we mentioned much of the above to the staff there they were genuinely concerned and rushed to offer us a replacement of our choice. We accepted another piece of Halibut which came with a piece of Haddock for us to try but alas 'twas the same. It may be my palate is over refined or that shows like \"Mind of a Chef\" and \"Spinning Plates\" are ruining the average diner for the average luncheonette but I'm going to hope that it was simply an \"off\" day at Busters."}
{"text":"so last friday i visited SLM with my chinese school. i don't know what got into me, but i guess i woke up feeling like i wanted to be hassled by the incredibly awful busters staff. especially a man named rob. watch out for this fucker. he will yell at you if you don't put more than 50 cents in the tip jar. not a pleasant experience for the customer.   rob also looked dirty and unkept, his googly eyes tried to intimidate me and my classmates but we did not fall for his silly games.   don't go here unless you want a degenerate prick named rob to haunt your afternoon   the food on the other hand was pretty good except for the fish and chips except i ordered fish and chips?"}
{"text":"The fish sandwich was bomb and other stuff too and the price was fair. Very happy and had a good time"}
{"text":"Best on-the-go seafood place in Toronto! Pricey but you get what you pay for! Every time I went, the food was always fresh and loaded with flavour. Lines are usually long but they have a system down so it moves pretty fast.  I usually get their jumbo shrimp po boy, fried calamari or swordfish sandwich. mmmm so good."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by another stall operator in the St. Lawrence market.  Fortunately, we were here waiting afternoon so there wasn't a typical long line that they apparently they get during lunch time.  That's a good thing, because it was bad even without having to wait.  The crab in the crabcakes is ground so finely that it tastes like mush.  There wasn't a solid piece of meat in the whole thing.  The calamari was plentiful, but bland.  And the halibut and chips were as greasy as could be.  I'd go elsewhere for a meal."}
{"text":"Had the fish sandwich and fries, and it was okay and I left feeling full. The main reason I am not giving the place a four is because I'm not sure if I would return, though it was hardly a bad experience.  The fish sandwich was a good size, and had plenty of fish in it. The bread was nice and all. But I prefer my fish to be crispier than how Buster's serves it. I like the contrast between crispy batter and flaky fish. Overall it all tasted fresh, but it didn't wow me. Things felt under seasoned.  The staff was friendly and efficient. They have plenty of malt vinegar.  My top place for fish n chips in the city is currently The One That Got Away on King."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after having been recommend this place by several people. Conveniently located in the St. Lawrence Market, this seafood hut is a great place to grab a quick bite. The only problem is, it's quite popular, so you need to be prepared to stand in a bit of a line, but that being said, the line does move pretty quickly!   On this particular occasion I enjoyed the haddock and fish and my husband enjoyed the haddock sandwich. Each dish came with coleslaw which was quite tasty (if eaten right away). If you let it sit on your plate for too long it gets warm.   Both of us enjoyed our dishes. The sandwich was nice and light (or as light as can be for a greasy deep fried fish sandwich). The batter they use on their fish is just a light dusting, which I very much appreciated!   I will certainly be making more regular stops at this place when I'm down at the Market. Next time I'm trying the steamed mussels though. I've heard great thugs about them!"}
{"text":"Amazing grilled calamari!!   Long lines, I'd suggest ordering with ritual ahead of time"}
{"text":"It's a bit expensive but overall it's good. Except for the Gumbo soup, nothing in it, no chicken, no shrimp...it's just a spicy tomato base."}
{"text":"Went there for the third time today, but finally am writing a review. This place is my favourite part of the St Lawrence market! My favourite so far is the fried calamari with fries, portion is huge and is consistenly good! Other things I have tried, the fried halibut and fries, snapper and fries, and halibut on a bun. The coleslaw also isn't bad that comes with the fish and chips and the halibut on a bun.  Service is rather fast even with the long lines the wait is not unreasonable. Space is the main issue but while you are waiting for your food if you are with someone I have always been able to get a spot to eat inside.   Next things I want to try are the crab cakes and some of their salads, I always recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Mushy tasteless \"crab\" cake sandwich. Barely any crab can be tasted in the cakes. Mostly bread crumb. Waste of 10$. Go to Ruth's Chris steak house on Richmond St W for REAL crab cakes."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out this place for awhile and checked it out on a Friday afternoon. I had the shrimp po-boy sandwich which was fairly decent and I have to say I made a lot of mental notes about the things I wanted to try in the future. However, my reason for giving two stars is the poor service. I don't want to sound over sensitive here, but two things really bothered me. First, I initially didn't hear them call out my order number. I was waiting patiently (it hadn't been too long and people ahead of me were still waiting); until when one of the guys barked \"GUYS who is order ##?...It's been sitting here for AGES!\"... Uh, excuse me....? Yes, my fault for not hearing the order the first time, but why not simply repeat the order number instead of being rude about it? For the record, \"ages\" was a mere two minutes. And second thing that bugged me was two females who were sitting at a table got their orders delivered to them at the table...while everyone else was standing and picking up their own order. Um, where's the etiquette here? I really hate going to a place and not seeing EVERYONE treated fairly.  :/ So these two instances left a bad taste in my mouth, and for that reason, I will not be returning. The place does fairly well so not like they need my business. *shrug*"}
{"text":"The lineup, and crowd you will meet here is a clear indication on how delicious and FRESH the food here is. I discovered Busters cove by accident one afternoon and I'm so happy I did. The shrimp Po Boy (cole slaw is under the wrapping, add it to the sandwich for an added flavor burst) is very popular and for very good reason; I always order that and the mahi mahi. My best tip is to have a good look at the menu written over head of the stall before you order, they have an amazing variety and everything I've seen come out of their kitchen looks delectable."}
{"text":"Prices are decent but food was mediocre. Lobster roll was serves cold with lots of seaning that I could barely taste the lobster. Fried clam strips just tasted like fried breading as they were so thin.  The nice thing is that they came with large poetion of salad or fries and salad. Halibut sandwich was large and good."}
{"text":"I think this place is worth every dollar spent.  I had the Rainbow Trout with Fries.  Coleslaw was great  Rainbow Trout was cooked and seasoned perfectly  Fries were an abundant amount  I ordered with Ritual and it was ready to go when I arrived.  Staff were courteous and it was a flawless experience.  All the yes here!"}
{"text":"This place used to be better a few years ago. Its not bad now, but just not as good as before. The crab cakes are good, but they used to be crispier on the outside. the bisque is probably one of my favorites.   Theres usually a line up of near by office workers who stepped out for a longer lunch and blue collar workers. The line up moves pretty quickly and the food is made right in front of you, so its worth the slight wait. Also, they only accept cash and debit. No credit."}
{"text":"We went to visit the St. Lawrence Market and while roaming the market my boyfriend spotted this place.    He is a sucker for certain types of food and when he saw the fish and chips, he had to give it a try.  We ended up sharing a plate of Boston Fish and Chips.    I think if we came here during non-rush hour this place might have gotten a higher star rating.  But my boyfriend was a bit disappointed that the fish and chips were soggy and not crispy :("}
{"text":"I would give a 3.5 if I could but he only reason it's not a 4 is because their seared tuna are just too salty for me. Like way too salty. Otherwise they carry wide selection of great sea food. Nutritious and healthy. I always get the seared tuna salad. Although it's salty and expensive but it's a good meal"}
{"text":"It's a shame that with all the new success and growth of BSC that the quality couldn't have stayed the same. frozen calamari  now... dry over battered halibut sandwiches.."}
{"text":"There was a consistent line up of at least 10 people on what they said was a slow day. They are pretty efficient so it doesn't take long. They do accept debit card, but not credit.  Ordered the crab cakes which came in two and with fries. They are inconsistent with their products, apparently. One was fried too dark and was really salty, while the other was fine. I find the crab cakes have too much of a dense, doughy texture because the mixture is blended too finely. Fries and coleslaw are good."}
{"text":"We ordered the crab cake sandwich and the swordfish sandwich...both were mouth-watering DELICIOUS!  And for the price, REALLY delicious.  We got fries and a salad as well. Both were yummy...the fries were crispy and the salad fresh.  St. Lawrence market is a hub of activity with lot's to see and do.  The people watching is great.  We loved our meal and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We had the lobster roll, lobster bisque n crab cakes.  Everything tasted okay except for the crab cakes which were dried n lack crabs."}
{"text":"Awesome concept at the market. The food isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for. The fish is always fresh and tasty. Perfectly fried or grilled, the calamari is a favourite of mine. The salad option is usually what I opt for and it's generous, fresh and crisp. The po'boys are delicious, and they use succulent shrimp and meaty, fresh oysters. Can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"Price, quality, quantity, no body even come close.  I think I order blue fish sandwich.  With 3 layers of breaded fried fish, fresh veggies, a good price.  Fresh is the key at this place.  It's breaded, but thin layer of crumbs, 3 layers of filet, bread is not thick, so you do seem to taste more of the fish than stuffing yourself.  Which is a good thing.  Recommend the Boston Bluefish sandwich.  I wish I had tried the clam chowder but it was out."}
{"text":"VIBE  On a Saturday afternoon, you'd think Sponge Bob Squarepants and his creature-of-the-sea friends were here because it's all bizzy in the hizzy. Seriously, there's a guy with a Madonna microphone spewing out seafood orders. So yes, it's good. And yes, you will get pushed from passerby.   I ATE Two words: Lobster Bisque. I had it twice in a week, it's so good. And especially good if you've just been to the dentist (take that, cavities!). The staff are friendly but they don't give you the nice touches especially if you're taking your food to go and on a busy Saturday (like I don't know a napkin or cutlery....they need to take notes from the guy at Churrasco).   Another note: if you do get the soup, they're not calling your order. You just go to the end of the counter to pick it up or at least speak up to ask an employee because otherwise, you'll be waiting there forever!   I've had their fish and chips before; they're okay.   Otherwise, there really is your pick of the seafood litter! It's not cheap but it looks like it's worth it. I may try the octopus or coconut shrimp in the future.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK When you don't think there are plenty of fish in the sea...then you haven't had Buster Seacove's Lobster Bisque."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out, got the coconut shrimp with fries and lobster bisque.  Super tasty!  Yes it was busy, but the staff are very organized and quick, also very personable.  Will be back! Really loved the fries!"}
{"text":"Lineup at this place is always long! My fav here is the lobster roll and the clam chowder soup. Seating is minimum because the place gets packed pretty quick. It's greasy as heck, so all dieters beware and find a different option because everything at this restaurant is greasy to the max!"}
{"text":"Best Lobster Rolls!!! Definitely have cravings for this place on a regular basis.  Perfect soft bun, lobster nice and fresh and just a delight!!! Speaking of cravings, going there tomorrow lol"}
{"text":"One of the best spots if you want a fresh fish cooked in front of you. Everything I have ordered from here has been amazing. It was so good I had to come back another time. Wish they had a  place like this in NY"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, such a long line! But moved so fast and efficiently! We had lobster rolls- fresh cold lobster on a chewy NoT greasy roll- so yum! Take your purchases outdoors, grab a table and enjoy your rolls a la Fresco for cheap!"}
{"text":"Ordered the charbroiled shrimp and fries after recommendations from yelp and a long line indicated that they would be deliciously tasty.   Yes it was good.  But, I would expect it to be good after paying essentially 3.75 per shrimp and 1.25 for a handful of greasy french fries.   I'm sure you can find better food elsewhere, or at least comparable food in a place that's actually a restaurant"}
{"text":"Several weeks ago I was at the St. Lawrence Market for a jam making class. After the class I had a few hours to kill and chose to walk around the market in search for something to eat. The options were endless, but ultimately I settled on calamari.   The line for Buster's was long, but it moved really quickly. I asked them the price difference between the grilled calamari and the fried calamari ($2 difference), so I went for the cheaper fried option. I had originally asked for a salad to go with my calamari, but changed my mind at the last minute and they were totally cool with me changing my order. It took less than 5 minutes for me to get my food.   I found an empty stool and began to eat my food. And there was a lot of it! The fries were good, but got soggy pretty quickly because of the box they came in (I asked for my food to go). The calamari was okay, but I did not really like the batter. Yet, even though the food was not amazing, something about the service and their really accommodating nature made the whole experience a good one. I am excited to try the other items on their menu. Oh, and they have debit. A huge plus since many vendors at the market only take cash."}
{"text":"Way too many options for a guy like me who already has trouble making major decisions about what to eat! I applaud them though for offering up pretty much every sea creature, so if you're a fan of fishies, this is THE place to eat at St. Lawrence Farmers Market.   The battered fish and chips looked incredible, and it's quite popular I gather because everyone waiting for their order before me, including two people I was eating with, walked away with fish and chips. I decided to go a liiiiiiiittle healthier and ordered a delicious grilled salmon salad that had incredible smoky grill flavor. I should also mention the portion size is enormous. A hefty amount of food four around 12 dollars.   The best thing this place has going? The staff. They are so quick to take your order while you wait in line, ring you up and expedite food faster than I believed. With about 5 guys on \"a line\" working to prep, cook and plate, it's amazing how quickly they're able to turn out lunch... appreciated to. Because the market is such a popular location for people to cruise around, when it comes time to eat, line ups form quick. These folks have found a system to manage it and for that my tummy thanks them!"}
{"text":"Buster's gets super busy at lunch time - so it's best to order on Ritual to avoid the long line ups. I ordered lunch from here on a Friday via Ritual and the order was ready in 5-8 minutes. There were at least 10 people in line around noon and lots of others waiting for food.   Rainbow Trout Sandwich ($12.95) - One of the most popular items on Ritual and definitely warranted - All the sandwiches are on ciabatta bread and pressed like a panini  - The fish is very very light and almost glides in your mouth!   Halibut Fish Sandwich ($10.95) - This was also good but not as good as the rainbow trout in terms of the fish - Sauce on the sandwich was great   Sandwiches comes with some coleslaw. You can add fries or a simple salad for $3. There are also \"fancier\" salads such as a Greek or Caesar salad for a dollar or so more.   The fries were on the salty end but we still ate all of it - just wish it wasn't as salted as it was. The basic $3 salad was a few slices of cucumbers, 2 cherry tomatoes and iceberg lettuce with a balsamic vinaigrette. Probably will opt out of this one next time.  Overall, a great Friday treat yourself kind of lunch spot! The food court where Buster's is located is decent in size so you can find a table. In the summer, they have an outdoor patio as well."}
{"text":"If you had been a stalker of mine two years ago, you would have been well acquainted with the back of the garbage can across from Buster's Sea Cove because I was there every weekday between 5 and 6pm without fail. That's how I got around to trying almost every item on the fabulously fishy menu.   While curiously long clam strips, crispy calamari rings, perfectly salty fried smelt, creamy clam chowder, and almost everything else on the menu are validly mouthwatering options, I hardly stray from my two faves now that I don't work just around the corner and have the time to visit daily anymore.   The perpetually friendly Mo knows that medium with a moist centre is the way I like my salmon grilled and that if I opt for the buttery grilled swordfish (that usually comes on a bun) that I'll have it on salad instead. The green salad which features grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red cabbage, carrots, and red onions is not merely a side, but a hearty edible arrangement. The un-creamy coleslaw is crunchy and flavourful.    I like to pull up a stool at the counter to watch the Sea Cove in action, but tables right in front allow friends (and friendly strangers on busier days) to sit together. Come on down and make some new acquaintences, be they fish or folk!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lobster roll  and the fried halibut sandwich. The lobster roll was ok. The lobster pieces were not chunky enough and I didn't get enough lobster flavour. The fried halibut sandwich (I got it spicy) on the other hand was great. I will definitely going back to order the other menu items.   Still in search of a good lobster roll in Toronto :(."}
{"text":"It offers very reasonable price, fresh seafood in downtown Toronto. I am a big fan of their grilled calamari, shrimp po boy, fish and chips.  It locates in the Southcore Financial Centre foodcourt; the place is spacious and seats are comfortable. Although there is always a long lineup, their service is very quick. Whenever I crave for seafood, I will go to Buster's Sea Cove!"}
{"text":"Oh god this place is good. I had the fish and chips and it was perfect.   First off, I want to say I believe there are two types of places that have great food. Ones that you have to pay an arm and a leg for and it is hard to get, and ones that make their money in bulk and have no patients for people who waste their time. This is the second one. So if you are expecting a nice conversation or help with the menu, forget it, go somewhere else. But if you are looking for amazing seafood and a dirt cheap price, come here and enjoy. Just be ready to be treated like a sardine if it is mealtime."}
{"text":"When you first see this place, the first thing you notice is the line-ups. At first glance, it looks like a typical 'greasy spoon'.  However  looks are deceiving. Buster's has a great menu selection and is a well run establishment. Prices are very reasonable and the serving portions are more than adequate. I had the chicken and shrimp gumbo soup (small size) and this was a meal in itself. Fresh chicken and shrimp, a zesty broth and tasty vegetables. I was luckily enough to sit on a stool in the front of the serving area,  and saw a lot great dishes leaving their compact and crowded kitchen. If you are shopping in the market and want a snack or lunch and have a craving for seafood, stop by here, you will be glad you did. It's fast, fresh and clean, and the service is great!"}
{"text":"We came here salivating for fried food after walking around the market for a bit. We ordered the bluefish and chips  and it was great! I was surprised that I liked it. The New England Clam chowder was good as well. Glad we stopped by to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Buster's Sea Cove is one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto.  This St. Lawrence Market institution brings the magic of a real Boston, New York City or Philadelphia fish stand to Toronto.  Try the haddock and chips.  And the clam chowder?!?  OMG!"}
{"text":"I love going to St. Lawrence market because of them. Massive long line ups at Buster's Sea Cove but they have really good and fast seafood. We usually get the seafood orzo but they run out quickly at weekends and if they don't have the orzo, it's either the tomato mussels or the lobster roll."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked on my yelp app for years and I still have not been. I was super excited to see their food truck at celebration square on canada day. My boyfriend and I ordered the shrimp tacos. They were the bomb dot com! We weren't that hungry to start and contemplating ordering another 4 because they were THAT good! The shrimps were a healthy size with a crispy coating but juicy and not overcooked. They came with a creamy slaw and home made salsa. I'm salivating thinking about it. I'm excited to go and order off their full menu."}
{"text":"I followed the raves here and I'm glad I did... I'm so tempted to give this place a 5 star review but my french fries were a bit underdone and weak.  OKok... 4.5 stars.  So onto the goods....  The fish here is amazing.  I came here because my colleague was craving some fish and chips.  I normally am not a deep batter type of person but I felt compelled to come because of the reviews.  I was blown away on the menu choices.  I couldn't decide so I asked what fish was the freshest and they said the halibut just came in hours before.  I asked for a grilled halibut sandwich and I saw the gentleman grab this huge piece of fillet and throw it on the grill.  I was so happy to see it wasn't a stingy piece.  The service here is really fast even though it looks like the queue for a Canada's Wonderland ride.  They're really efficient and I dare say... pleasant for a fast food counter!  They're really quite nice.  So within minutes I got my really hot slab of fresh halibut with fries on the side.  I was so amazed at the size of it that I didn't know where to start.  My colleague already took two large bites out of her fish and she was making those 'mmmm' noises.  She showed me the bite and all you can see is a large piece of fish with the crispy poofy batter around it.  She told me that the batter was so light and crispy that it shatters in her mouth.  She loved it.  My halibut was so well executed.  It had that nice charred edging that gives it great flavour but it was not dried out at all.  It was so succulent.  I should be grateful this isn't my normal office lunch area or I'd be spending all my spare change here.  I saw other people enjoy the battered calamari and I think that will be my next order here.    As for the fries, perhaps they were overshadowed by the halibut or they were undercooked but they were pretty sad and flimsy.  I think they knew they would never keep up with the amazing fresh seafood here.  As for the cost, I would say it's not pricey.  Sure it's pricey for 'fast food' but this a completely different league.  No where in the Path or other downtown counters can you get seafood this fresh and this well made in such a short time.  This is my new favourite place in SLM!"}
{"text":"Fast and efficient service (could take more time and be a bit nicer, though). Good food, but I had better fish'n chips in Victoria, BC, or London, UK. Fish is not that moist, not that tasty, with pretty small portions for the price, but overall OK.  A sure place, I guess, though nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to be the party pooper on this one.  I know people like this place, I guess because of the unbeatable location right inside the amazing St. Lawrence market.  However, Buster's Sea Cove is not for me.  Sure, on paper it sounds good - freshly prepared fish, simply made.  But two dishes I ordered here on two separate occasions were very disappointing.  One was sardines, which could be fantastic elsewhere, but here was very bad.  The other was fish 'n chips that wasn't very good (although the chips were good.)  Add to that the fact that the food is not cheap.  Compound it with the long line-up.  And to top it all, you always have to fight for a seat.  To quote Public Enemy: \"Don't believe the hype.\""}
{"text":"I love Buster's Sea Cove, but my only complaint is that I don't get to come here enough. The seafood is fresh and delicious. I LOVE the calamari and crab cake sandwich. I love the crab cakes so much that I really can't try anything else when I come (although I want to). The portions are huge, and I can rarely finish my meal. The crab cake is crisp on the outside, juicy and really nicely seasoned. I tried the lobster roll once, and just wasn't a huge fan. To be fair, I think that has more to do with my personal preferences. The roll was packed full of large lobster chunks, but I don't love the fact that it's served cold. Expect long lines, but it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"After a long wait, and planning around erratic St. Lawrence Market hours, I was FINALLY able to get to Buster's Sea Cove to have another taste of their Lobster Roll...  Yup, just as moist and flavourful as I remembered it. Unlike some of it's competitors, you can actually see the visible chunks of lobster meat mixed-in, and spilling out the top of the buttered bread. Until another challenger comes along, the Lobster Roll here is THE standard.  Though a bit on the pricey side ($15), the roll comes with a side of coleslaw, and the choice of fries or salad. The salad looks pre-packaged from somewhere else, but was fresh and varied. Though my focus was on the roll, the shoe-string fries were also surprisingly good as they were just the right amount of oily and crispy.    The only improvement I (and I'm sure others) have/can suggest for this place is to open up another location! The early-close times of the market hours makes it difficult for some to get to in time, not to mention the cramped and somewhat unkept seating area of its current location. For those that work or live nearby though, Buster's Sea Cove is a \"can't miss\" for lunch and/or early dinner."}
{"text":"So I go here often to get the shrimp po'boy. Today I went for my usual po'boy and decided to get the crab cakes with rice. Big mistake. The side of white rice was very bland with absolutely no flavouring, but the worst part were the crab cakes. They had so much filer in it that I started to wonder if there were any crab in there at all. Yes, I wasn't expecting huge chucks of crab but as I was eating it all I could taste was the filler they used, soggy bread. Never again. I thought everything on the menu was good but I had to learn that the hard way. Save your money and have crab cakes somewhere else. The shrimp po'boy is still good tho."}
{"text":"Yorkville is a horrible location for affordable good eats in my opinion.  Around the Yonge and Bloor area, it's mostly chains.  Within Yorkville, the prices for a meal are sky high for mostly mediocre food at best.  So when I spotted Busters Sea Cover open on Yonge St., I was elated.  One of my favourite seafood spots, in an area I frequent (instead of having to go down to St. Lawrence Market to satisfy my seafood cravings).  I ordered my usual, grilled calamari & salad, hubby ordered fish and chips (I can't remember if it was cod or halibut), and aunt ordered the lobster roll.  Hubby's fish and chips were great as usual.  Crispy batter, and moist fish on the inside.  The lobster roll, my aunt was quite pleased with.  After biting into the roll, she said, wow it's real lobster!  The fries unfortunately were mostly too salty, for both the fish and the lobster roll.  A little to heavy handed with the salt that day I guess.  As much as I love my calamari, I have to say this time, it felt that the calamari wasn't very fresh.  It was also a bit chewier than the norm.  Salad was fresh and tasty.  So I'm not sure if it was an off day for the calamari, or if I would need to still make the trek down to the St. Lawrence Market to satisfy my craving."}
{"text":"I hit up Buster's Sea Cove as part of my continuing quest to find a real lobster roll in Toronto.  Why is this so hard?  All I want are big chunks of lobster, covered in either a balanced dousing of clarified butter, or a bit of mayo, green onion, and celery.  That's it.  This shouldn't be that complicated.  Like most places offering lobster rolls in Toronto, Buster's attempts the latter option with mayo and such, but the freshness just isn't here: the lobster salad's all made in one giant batch hours before it's piled into your split roll, and while the portion is generous and the flavor's actually probably superior to say, Rock Lobster, you're critically aware that you're not eating a dish that was made for you.  The lobster's been shredded into little bits and then compressed and packed into the roll, and it's just... this is not a win.  It's not bad, but it's not a lobster roll victory.  I had my roll with a very solid slaw and some perfectly passable fries.  I also nabbed a cup of clam chowder, which was outstanding; thick and creamy, it was rich in clam flavor.  It may be a bit intense for some, but that clammy taste is largely what I'm looking for.  I'd probably come back just on account of the chowder the next time I'm at the St. Lawrence Market.  I'm eager to try some of their grilled fish, too; some of the fish I saw coming off the grill looked wonderful, and they offer a wide array of fish grilled to what sure looked and smelled like perfection.  Also?  The cook working the grill when I went had the appearance of a one-eyed Mediterranean pirate.  And frankly, I see that as a bonus.  It just makes the food a little bit more enjoyable.    You can really taste the pirate.  I try not to do the \"3.5 stars\" thing since it's frankly just a fictional rating that doesn't exist, so I'm gonna go ahead and call this four stars, because I'm sure I'll eat here again and have a four-star experience anyways.  But yeah - the quest for lobster roll excellence in Toronto sadly continues."}
{"text":"One of the best place to go for seafood in downtown Toronto. The Halibut and chips are very dependable. Simple and delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered a lobster roll and an order of fish and chips. The lobster roll was $15 and terrible. It looked like imitation crab that came out of a can. The fish was mediocre and pretty bland and the fries had no seasoning and were overcooked and looked like the poor man's McDonalds fries."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a few weeks ago with a friend. The lineup was super long (as I believe is pretty much always the case), but I think they have a pretty good system going where someone will come around the line and take your order ahead of time with the intention of speeding things up... but you'll still have to wait a bit for your food in the end. I ordered their special of the day, which was a halibut sandwich, for about $8 plus tax which came with some coleslaw. I thought it was a pretty good sandwich and came hot and tasted pretty fresh but didn't amaze me. My friend ordered crab cakes, which were a bit on the pricier side (around $13). He said they were good, although he had to wait a LOT longer for his lunch than I did for some reason. I wouldn't mind coming here to try other menu items in the future, maybe their lobster roll will impress me."}
{"text":"I read such good reviews for this place and since I was at the market, I figured I'd try it out. First time I went I ordered the calamari and chips to go, and sat on a bench in the park opposite. The older British lady beside me commented on how she always ordered the same from Buster's and we stuck up a lovely conversation. But back to the food. I was mildly satisfied, since the portion was huge and filled me right up. The curly fries were delicious, but the calamari was just OK.   So I decided to go back again and this time I tried the calamari grilled this time around. It was more expensive of course, but for that I was expecting better food. It came out as 6 large pieces of calamari covered in seasoning and slightly blackened. They gave me some sort of sour cream sauce that looked like tartar (and most definitely wasn't) so I had to ask for tartar on my own. Anyways, the grilled calamari was definitely better than the fried variety, but I found it much to salty for my liking and lacking any flavour other than charring and lemon that I'd squeezed all over it. I'm a calamari fiend, but both their calamari dishes failed to wow me in any sense.  Still, I'm a sucker for seafood and will most likely be back. Maybe I'll try the actual fish this time.  And a note on the line-up/ordering system: I agree, it's very unorganized. They ask you to order at the cash but at the same time they're taking orders from the other end of the bar, and soon the staff get confused with who's paid and who hasn't, and who's ordered and who hasn't, and the patrons are even more confused. then, given the lack of adequate seating in the area, there's a buildup of people looking for seats, saving seats, and still trying to decide what to order. If they figure out a more efficient system it'd save headaches for the staff and for customers."}
{"text":"Inside St Lawrence Market. Long line usually means good food, someone came to take your order in line to speed it up. I tried the fresh crawfish po boy & gumbo soup, it was good. Limited seating here."}
{"text":"This place is delicious... Fresh seafood and produce truly makes a difference! Avoid the lunch / dinner rush if you can especially if it's your first time going, because it gets quite busy and the servers are annoyed if  you take your time to decide or fumble with change. It is incredibly frustrating, aggravating, and perhaps ridiculous sometimes, but I guess that's what happens when a place so small and cramped in the corner gets flooded by so many people. The fried clams, lobster rolls, fish and chips... Well heck, everything is a winner here, however, I'm not a fan of their coleslaw. I personally deem it worth the wait and rushed atmosphere, though if you are lucky enough to come across their food truck at a festival, they are much nicer and relaxed and carry all the same favourites."}
{"text":"I eat here every time I come to St. Lawrence Market. Had the shrimp po' boy this time, and it's amazing. Theres always a line up, and it may see long, but they have a really effcient system so you'll get your food in 10-15 mins max."}
{"text":"This place wasn't easy to find, unless you know exactly where it is. It is located at the back of St. Lawrence market. I ordered their lobster roll and it was good, but still missing some uniqueness from it. I can taste the freshness of the lobster, it came with some fries and coleslaw on the side. The size was not the best thing on the menu. Seating is weirdly laid out there, and there is additional seating outside of the market. Overall the food is worth a try if you are around the area.  Service: 3/5 Food: 3/5 Environment 3/5  Overall: 3/5"}
{"text":"Buster's Sea Cove is bustling during the noon-hour lunch rush, so if you want to avoid the crowding and the long lines, then avoid noon to one. The food here is just as good as the Buster's Sea Cove located at St Lawrence Market. I have been to this location numerous times, since it's one of the few lunch options available in Southcore Financial Center.  On cold days, I really like their lobster bisque. I have also tried the clam chowder, but think that the bisque is tastier and a better value. The crab cake sandwich is really good, though sometimes I feel like it's a little too dense and take the rest home. The lobster roll is also tasty but I thought that it was a little on the pricey side compared to what you get. The halibut sandwich is amazing, though."}
{"text":"Ate here and food was quite deplorable. I don't understand these good reviews at all. Halibut fish and chips was small portion and the quality was way below average. Can't compare this place to high street in north York. Go to high street and experience the difference. Also the owner, Tom, is very rude and he yells and screams at his employees. His smile is fake and I will never, ever eat here again. 5 thumbs down!"}
{"text":"I had the Greek salad with grilled swordfish and my husband had the Boston bluefish fish and salad. Both were very yummy. The olives on my greek salad had pits and were very bitter, more bitter than regular kalamata olives. They also put a ton of feta on my salad so that was good. It was reasonably priced and seemed very popular. It was very busy for lunch!"}
{"text":"Stay away from the crab cakes. Soggy and mushy in the middle. They don't taste like crab at all. I would have to say it was one of the worst crab cakes I have ever eaten.   Halibut and chips was good. Everyone ordering po boys. Shud have got that instead.  Left very unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I'm writing this food review in hopes that the owners will consider making some changes to the presentation of their lobster roll sandwich.  Their lobster roll has deteriorated so much in the last few years.  Before, you would get a sandwich that was overflowing with a lobster mixture that was flavourful and chunky. In addition, there was a generous amount of creamy coleslaw included. Now, the lobster mixture has the consistency and taste of a salmon salad sandwich. The amount of coleslaw is just about 1/2 cup, like the amount that KFC gives (side salad and pickle same as before). I don't mind paying $15 or more if it is well presented and good quality. I should had picked up the warning signs when most people in the long line up ordered other menu items."}
{"text":"This was nice to find in the back of St Lawrence market. It definitely has the fried fish / shrimp down. I have tried many meals here but my most favourite one is the shrimp Po boy! A must try at busters sea cove! Though their lobster roll is disappointing."}
{"text":"Buster's Sea Cove has a nice feel and look to it. Ordered the first one on the favourite menu, the Boston Blue Fish and Chips with Fries. Worked out to $10 flat, not to bad for lunch. Large portion too.  It was tasty and although fish and chips is typically greasy, I did not find it too greasy. And the colesaw that came with it was really refreshing."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a quick lunch. I ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich and it was quite good. The flavours were really bold, but I'd say that the crab cakes were too doughy and heavy for my liking. I became really full after eating only half of the sandwich. The sandwich also comes with coleslaw, which was buried under the sandwich and I didn't notice it until I finished eating half of the sandwich. I would come back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Buster's is definitely worth the walk through the always packed St.Lawrence Market!  This sea cove is located right at the end of the busy Market, so you'll certainly work up an appetite making your way there, but the food will more than satisfy! Upon approaching the counter you can see the fresh seafood deliciously displayed in front of the friendly and efficient staff. There is usually quite a line up but luckily the service is great and it moves quickly.   Although seating is limited and you really do have to grab a free seat as soon as you spot one, the atmosphere does give that  busy downtown market feel.  It is  a bit nicer & relaxed in the summer time as there are picnic benches just outside the building beside the cove.   We ordered the halibut sandwich and the New England clam chowder and were given a number to wait on our order.  I considered the lobster roll but wasn't in the mood for a cold sandwich, although I heard it was really good. We received our order and dug into the clam chowder first - it was very thick and tasty!   We then chowed down on the halibut which had a healthy sandwich spin to it.  The fish was sandwiched inside a grill pressed panini bun with lettuce, tomato, onion and a type of tarter sauce.  Although the halibut was battered and fried, it wasn't greasy. It was excellent and added a needed crispness to the sandwich.   I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. First they don't accept credit card. When I asked to use USD they changed me on 1:1 and didn't inform me this. I understand I should have used CAD, but at least tell your customer you could only do 1:1. I ordered halibut&chips. halibut is a little dry and no flavor at all. Chips are horrible! They're not crispy nor fresh at all. The oil they used made me disgusted. NEVER EVER EVER Buster again!"}
{"text":"Located inside of Kensington market in one of the corners.    Let's just say ordering and production is a well oiled machines. Someone calls in the order for you while your in line.    By the time you get to the cash register, your food is almost ready. The cash register takes your payment then you wait to the right of it to get your food and pick up your soup at another counter.    Lobster roll 15 Canadian dollars with fries was just okay.  We had a few better ones in new York and cali so it was a little hard to beat.  The roll was not really heated and I sure do enjoy a warm roll with the cold lobster Cole slaw.   Small clam chowder 4.50 Canadian was okay also.  Nothing special but better than canned.     I probably would only try this place once but would probably skip it next time."}
{"text":"Any seafood place at a market will sure to be busy, and Buster's Sea Cove is no exception. However it did not live up to the hype. We decided to get a lobster roll - big mistake. The 'lobster' had the consistency of minced tuna with tiny chunks of lobster through it. It didn't have that signature sweetness of lobster and wasn't smooth and tender. The bun was very bleh, and doughy.   It also came with a slaw, chips and a pickle. The sides were not noteworthy but the chips were decent. We can't comment on any of the other dishes but definitely avoid the lobster roll."}
{"text":"Great place for a fun lunch if you are in town checking out the city.   It's an experience!  Right in the St Lawrence market south building all the way at the end. Limited seating inside, but picnic tables are outside.     We got the blue fish and chips, grilled octopus and clam chowder.   Very generous portions of fish - 3 fillets per order.  Lots of fries and cole slaw - both just ok.   Blue fish was hot, flakey and delicious.   Octopus portion was small and it was just ok.   Clam chowder was very tasty but not anything special.   Forus this place was really all about the great fried fish and experience as part of the market."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  Whenever friends visit from out of town, I often bring them here.  Pros:  *excellent food (very fresh and well cooked) *reasonably affordable *fun setting  Cons: *cash or debit only (and there's a surcharge for debit) *it can get crowded - think long lines and nowhere to sit  Tips: *get there before noon or after, say, 1:30pm (or 2pm, to be safe) to avoid the crowds *keep moving down the counter after you've made your order to make room for people *listen to the line cooks attentively for your number (sometimes there's a bit of a wait for food) *don't keep badgering the line cooks for your order because they can have a bit of a temper (understandable because they're always super slammed)  What to Try: *lobster roll (it's served on a great bun, but the portion is very small) *grilled calamari (served with an amazing chimichurri-like sauce!) *haddock or halbut and onion rings (don't bother with their fries) *mussels *grilled swordfish *grilled shrimp *crab cakes"}
{"text":"I'm Nova Scotian, the weather is getting warmer, thus I have lobster on the brain. Just thinking about them tikatika*-ing across the Atlantic floor makes me want to run out and buy a pound of butter.   When I feel like a high roller and am at St. Lawrence getting my cheeses and mustard already, I head to Buster's Sea Cove. It's $20 for a very full and lightly seasoned lobster roll, and it's worth it. You deserve it, treat yo'self. It comes with thick yet crispy fries and a slaw, and the bun is warm and buttery. Their mayo to lobster to green onion ratio is just right, and they don't skimp on how much they shmush in there.   All the fish fry coming our of this place looks terrific, but I will go for lobster every time, so I will never know what it's like.   *I've been told that's the sound of me sneaking off to get a snack, and I've decided it's also the sound of crustaceans scurrying along ocean floors."}
{"text":"Halibut fish and chips. Pretty pricey for two small pieces of fish. Tons of fries. I've had better. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Do not let the long line scare you!!  Long lines should actually attract you because it means quality food!! Ya the trendy insta worthy underrated places gear up long lines too but busters is not like this!! they've been around for a while and the fish is on point!!  I always get the grilled calamari salad. Huge portion of fish and the dressing is to die for!  I would love to try something else but I tend to stick to what I like!!   Would love to check out their other location"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try their food especially after seeing \"swordfish sandwich.\" Their food truck was suppose to be at a few events I went to, but they've always been a no-show.  This time, I came to their St. Lawrence Market location just to check out it!   There are absolutely very few seating available for a workday's lunch period, also the tables are quite messy as people grab the seats before the cleaning person gets a chance to sweep.   The staff at Buster's Sea Cove are amazing, very energetic, pleasant, and great to talk to. AND FAST. We got our food quite fast, which left us plenty of time to find seats and eat during the 1 hour lunch.  Firstly, their clam chowder. WOW!! Very thick and full of flavor. It comes with goldfish crackers, so cute.  I had the Haddock & Chips. The batter was so thin it was crispy and SOFT! The fish meat was excellent, it still had the fresh fish taste.   My friend's Tuna Melt was amazing. YES I had a bite. Also he was sick... Anyways, it was very good -you could say, THICK stuffing in the sandwich.   I'd say about $15 a lunch, depending on your order. The cooler stuff are def more expensive, but I'd love to try!!   You can't go wrong with grilled/fried/fastfood-style seafood."}
{"text":"We got Halibut and Chips and the Crab cakes...great quality and quick service...will definitely be returning"}
