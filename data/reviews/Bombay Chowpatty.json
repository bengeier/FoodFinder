{"text":"Went to buy Royal Falood and spent $8 dollars. The dish is served in a plate with noodle flavour on it. Instead she gave it like a shake which is not how its served and was completely opposite to the picture on the menu. When asked the manager said that's how it's served and that its not like the picture on the menu. Be cautioned and ask how your item actually looks compared to the menu. Would never buy from here again"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and underwhelming. We came in for a Mango Lassi, Royal Falooda and Pani Puri. We got some liquid yogurt with a coloured syrup that didn't taste like Mango at all. The Falooda barely had any seeds. The Pani Puri was $5.99 for 6 tiny puffs, bland boiled potatoes and chickpeas out of a can. So dissapointing. And the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Im not sure how alot of people are rating this place good, but this place was terrible.

Service, food, interior decore, everything was bad.
The lady there was quite rude and over charged us telling us that the price was the old price.... Which means you need to update your god damn menu.

Nothing there satisfied my cravings for some delicious vegetarian indian food with my boyfriend. Definitely not coming back there... And I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. Do yourself a favour.... Save your money and cravings somewhere more worthy..... I swear to you."}
{"text":"Pav Bhaji is excellent. I'm a repeat customer for that alone. Samosas ain't bad. I've had better."}
{"text":"No no no!! Ruined my day!! Please dont ruin my childhood favourite dishes with whatever you are doing to them.. had pav bhaji and dahi bhalla.. couldnt have been worse"}
{"text":"We had the papri chat and the vada pav. It was to go and a while before we had them, but they were good. The papri chat was good but the vada pav needed seasoning.
They have heeded to advice and cleaned up the washrooms. The staff was friendly and the service prompt.
Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"We checked-in while strolling at Gerrard East and got hungry. We, vegetarians were immediately attracted by their sign promising goodies meant for us.

When stepped in we were a bit confused, as the place looked a video store at first glance...on a Sunday afternoon the place was empty, but we noticed that the tables were still dirty and so was the floor. Anyway we had hard time to choose what we wanted, as the prices were good and food was appealing. We ended up getting vegetarian burgers and asked for a cup of water, served thankfully in a jug and plastic cups. Also we asked to clean our table before sitting down. So it is not a place you take your sweetheart to enjoy a private dinner.

The food tasted good or rather A-OK, the mock patty was a bit too hot for me (hahhaa, yeah, I am tender like that) and the bread was a bit dry. Since it was a light snack didn't feel very stuffed afterwards, but that is my own problem anyway. But we are thinking of giving this place another chance.

While writing this I can't wait to get home and prepare my dahl..."}
{"text":"First impression  ...that's one  dirty restaurant...and if dinning hall is such a filth .. what can be going on around  the kitchen. Cleanliness is fundamental with running  a restaurant...as for the food...I had a bhel...looks like it was prepared from a ready made package....sorry..I was so totality PUT OFF"}
{"text":"Delicious chaat and pakoras. Good customer service, and a super casual vibe."}
{"text":"We went for Chaat last night to Bombay Chowpatty and were not amazed by the food there.  While the Pani Puri was the best thing on the menu, the masala fries, bhel puri, ragada and dhai puri were nothing to write home about.  Way better chaat places to go to on Gerrard St.  Very disappointing as being from Mumbai and eating on Chowpatty beach growing up, thought the restaurant would be able to replicate the experience."}
{"text":"On my most recent trip to Little India, we stopped in at Bombay Chowpatty for some India street snacks.  I was craving some chaat and my friends were curious to what chaat was.

Upon entering we were taken back at the fact that this location serves as a DVD rental place as well.  The Indian music playing in the background added to the full street snack experience.

We ordered chaat, pani puri and pakoras to sample the various street snacks!  They came out in phases, which was great because we got eat while we waited for the next dish.  Every dish was fresh and well executed.  The flavours blended so well.  The pakoras were not overtly greasy and were devoured.

I want to try the lassis and shakes my next visit!  You have to check this place out when you are in the Little India area.  They are 100% vegetarian as well!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place isn't by my house because I'd get fat drinking shakes and eating everything on the menu.

I wanted a snack and ordered the Ragda Patties topped with chickpeas, onions, tomatoes, tamarind, and chutney. 

I thought I was in heaven.  Spicy, sweet, crispy, and mushy all at the same time!  With a mango lassi, it was a perfect snack.

I kinda wish I was hungrier, so I could have the masala fries ($3.99)
 or one of the veggie burgers (which is like the Ragda patties but in burger form for $5.99).

This late night place is one of my favorite snack joints.
Cheap, cheerful, and if you want,  you can get Bollywood DVD's at the same time!

I wish I could go back and have fries right now.  :("}
{"text":"While a little rough around the edges and also partly a video store, the staff was very accommodating. I arrived right as they were closing on a Saturday night (but didn't realize). They let me dine in anyway and were very kind. 

I can't remember the name of the dish I ordered but it was very flavorful and spicy. While a very casual spot, they insisted on boxing up my leftovers for me. 

The decor is a bit shabby and they only have plastic utensils but, my dining experience made up for it."}
{"text":"After lunch at 5 Spices http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-5-spices-restaurant-toronto#hrid:l33exM2UCMUCWjNaMs8taw, my 5 friends and I popped across the street for some nice dessert.

We all had versions of lassis or shakes. I believe 3 Pista Thandais were ordered (pistachio, saffron, cardamom), plus a couple of others that I can't recall. I believe one had rose flavour.  I had the mango shake.

We all LOVED them."}
{"text":"Great place to get chaat in the area! We order the samosa chaat and the masala fries. The masala fries was a little out there, but it was still nice as it was flavored fries with ketchup and chutneys. The samosa chaat was tasty and flavorful, especially when you are craving for chaat."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times and nvr knew how big it was. We wanted to grab some Indian snacks. The staff is wonderful and service is quick. View my posted images for what we ordered. Def will go back again."}
{"text":"I was craving Indian street food, so I ended up venturing into Little India and popped in here for a quick bite. Keep in mind, this is really not a fancy sit down place. It's more of your cafeteria style seating with minimal service, BUT the food is great and inexpensive! What more do you want when you're eating chaat? 

I've only tried the samosa chaat and masala fries here. The samosa chaat is basically a deconstructed samosa with yogurt, chutneys, and other deliciousness. This was so yummy and I still crave it to this day - really not something you can get in a fancy restaurant! Keep in mind, this dish is a little spicy so ask them to tone down the red pepper if spice isn't your thing. As for the masala fries, this was a strange combo of Indian masala fries and Canadian ketchup fries? I'm not sure I would get this again, but it was nice to try once. 

I'd recommend coming here with a couple other people, ordering a bunch of things on the menu, and sharing! That's the best way to eat chaat so you can try all the different flavors and varieties of Indian street food."}
{"text":"Cramped location primarily focused to selling paan. Seating arrangement is not children friendly and service is non existent."}
{"text":"Came here as part of the UYE Little India crawl.  It was a great choice!  They had mostly snacks, but any one of them could have counted as a meal.  The veggie pakora was very good and filling, but my favourite was the paneer.  Not sure the exact name, but they were like cute little fried paneer squares, and with 8 pieces for only 6 bucks!  The Dahi Bhalla was also good...and large.  It was served cold though, which surprised me (although this is common for yogurt dishes).  Fantastic flavour here for sure.

I also ordered the mouth-watering kulfi, which was served in a little rowboat and full of ice cream, noodles, creamy stuff, rose flavour, pistachios, and lots of other tasty things.  It was kind of like a rice pudding texture.  So sweet, and a perfect end to the crawl.
Luckily they have illustrated pamphlets, so you know what you're getting, and you can also specify how hot you'd like it.  

And if the mood strikes you, they also have hundreds, or perhaps thousands of Bollywood DVD's for sale!

Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"I came here for pani puri (5.99) earlier tonight at 9PM and this is what I got. Definitely not the best. You're better off with street pani puri for sure! Previously I've had bhel puri from here before which was quite good so I'm hoping today was just a bad night (it was the very end of Eid, which is probably one of the busiest nights of the year)"}
{"text":"i LOVE this place. the food is cheap and so, so good! i also love the bollywood DVDs lining the walls and one of these days, i am going to rent one. my only gripe is that on my last visit, i ordered masala fries (as usual) and they used ketchup instead of the usual tamarind chutney. it was really disappointing and was not as mindblowingly delicious the way it is with the tamarind chutney. i hope this was just because they ran out of the tamarind chutney and not because they have actually switched to using ketchup."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic chat place !!! I am born and brought up in Delhi and have had authentic chat items to enjoy . This place did an amazing job and customer service was very good as well. 

Kudos to this place ..."}
{"text":"Delicious Mumbai style food. The waiters are friendly. Their vada-pav & kulfi falooda are the best I've had outside of India. The place is bare basic and the metal tables & chairs are awfully cold. The washrooms could be a lot cleaner. Other than this if you are hankering for chaat this is the place to go.
They definitely need to update their freezing cold metallic furniture. It is very uncomfortable to go here when it's cold. Everyone sits here wearing jackets!! Afded to this, they probably keep their thermostats very low. Does not make for a comfortable eating experience. The saada paan was $1:50 - smallest paan I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Just checked this place out after work today in order to pick up a few treats for an Indian themed UYE at Harbourfront Centre tonight.  

While Lauren M. and I waited for our take out order we decided to try their Dahi Bhalla as a small snack since it WAS after 5pm and we WERE hungry!  It was delicious!

So after indulging in the delicious dumplings, we took the remainder of our take out order to the Indian themed UYE.  We had purchased vegetables pakoras, samosas and one other item (name escapes me).  

After trying all of the items, I have to say that their food is pretty good and that this place is definitely one that I will go back to.

The prices were extremely reasonable and service was quick."}
{"text":"Worst food! Nothing great about this place. The staff looks pretty new in this kind of business and the food is not authentic at all. Way to high prices in terms of the quantity and quality.Avoid this place and go somewhere else on the street. Worst they do not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"I love the name. CHOWPATTY!! Ventured in as part of the UYE Little India Crawl. They open around 1:30 or 2. Don't go early, :P.

The Royal Falooda is Bombay Chowpatty's specialty drink which features a lovely blend of rose syrup, chilled milk, aaand ice-cream garnished with pistachios and almonds but hold up! It's not for everyone. Your drink (?) features vermicelli! Yes, as you slurp up your delicious blend you've got those slippery noodles as well which... gives an entirely different experience. 

I'd really have to get one (okay, more than one. no holding back, y'all!) of their snacks to make a legit review. From what I could sample from Neil/Zandra's orders, the pakoras were pretty good! And those paneer pieces looked rather appetizing, *__*."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim a few days ago and I'm sold! 

Bombay Chowpatty dishes up snacks, and for some, meals you'd find on the roadside in Mumbai. The everyman snack that is fingerlicking good when done right. I know an Indian restaurant has it figured out when it's comparable to what I've had in the motherland. The store is on the North-West corner of the intersection, and you'll be hard to miss it with the vast number of Indian & Canadian flags fluttering upon the building. 

I've tried their other location at Islington in Etobicoke, although this location is much more of a sit down restaurant/dvd store and the other is more of a Bollywood video store selling Paan and beverages.

On my visit, I tried Chaat Papri and Dahi Bhalla($5 each), and Pista Thandai($3). A dish of Chaat Papri is made up of fried chips (not french fries) served under yogurt, chickpeas, potatoes, slices of green mango, tamarind chutney and some spices. The Dahi Bhalla is made up of fried lentil balls drowned in light yogurt, chutney with spices like cumin and pepper. Both were delicious and their servings, quite large. 

The pista thandai, when done right, is a lightly sweetened, milky, pistachio flavoured beverage. Mine however, was very slightly disappointing when compared to the delicious snacks, as it was very obviously made with ice cream, making it overly sweet. If you do like sweet drinks however, you may find that it tastes just like a pistachio flavoured milkshake. 

For those whose familiarity to Indian food begins and ends with Butter chicken, (Why so serious... with food?) don't be intimidated, for everything on the pamphlet-style menu comes with pictures and a highly accurate description. 
I will most definitely return here with my camera and an empty stomach. 

Tip: For those slightly allergic to nuts, I would certainly advise the staff/waiter about it, as you can't expect on which dish the nuts will appear. (I love nuts so it's a plus for me, but if you're highly allergic to nuts I'd probably forego this place altogether).

Woo! Review 1-0-0!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this spot while exploring India Bazaar on a recent trip to Toronto. A massive heat wave meant that we needed cold bevvies. We went in and ordered a mango shake and grabbed an ice-cold Limca. Delish! That mango shake changed our lives forever. We vowed to return and check out some of the chaat offerings. Nummy. Num. Nums. What a nice, clean and cool retreat for snacks and shakes!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting Bombay Chowpatty for years and I consider it the best place to get Indian Chaat in Toronto. My personal favorite is the Vada Pav - which is delicious and filling. They have great portion sizes which leave you satisfied without feeling like you have overeaten. They also have great service and usually very quick to get your order. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was craving chaat and we had a bit of time before our stand up show so went to this place for some ragada chaat. 

it was delicious! Could have reduced on the chutney so the tikki would have been less soaked but it still was pretty good. 

Would come back for another plate!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. Food quality was terrible, customer service was horrible (the lady who i'm assuming is the manager was giving us major attitude), and the food was not as appetizing as pictured in thier menu. Prices were way too inflated for the ammount and quality of food we recieved. Not satisfied and not happy with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow! What amazing food!

The interior isn't the most nicely decorates, and we sat down to some dirty tables, but this isn't a fancy restaurant, it's a popular place for chaat and savoury snacks.

We stayed away from the masala fries, because we had been eating a lot of potatoes lately.

The staff is really friendly and they make an effort to help any newbies with the menu. I ordered a mango lassi and the clerk began to give me a Wikipedia explanation of what a lassi is. I found it to be a lot less thick than other lassis and while it tasted good, the flakes of almond were kind of annoying.

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Its an Indian street food joint , all stuff on the menu is authentic indian street food, but not the taste.. it's okay when you crave for it and missing home. Nothing is awesome or exceptional or great but nothing is bad either :)

when you are in the vicinity, can go for it, as they have good sitting area, particularly patio."}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood so have been going here for a number of years. I think this past year something has happened -  new owners, or several new owners perhaps. 

The women's bathroom had no toilet paper or paper towels, an overflowing trash bin, and no soap - and best of all, on the door to the bathroom, there was a terse handwritten sign saying \"KEEP BATHROOM CLEAN\". 

It's somewhat of an open kitchen in the back, but I couldn't quite see how our food was being prepared. 

We were there on a Saturday afternoon, and they were out of the first three things we tried to order. 

I am sad that this place seems to have lost their touch, and for my own gastro-intestinal safety, can't rationalize going back."}
{"text":"Service was what ever, food was OK, very small portion, price point OK.
Washrooms smell and are very dirty"}
{"text":"FOOD:

PRO: Finally some spicy Indian food! Most of the Indian food here in Toronto, even if they tell you it's spicy, once you taste it, it is not really spicy. That's why I appreciated that they serve REAL spicy and tasty food here. They also have Kulfi here and it's also good. 

PRICE: 

PRO: Inexpensive, and you will get the value of your money coz the food tastes good.

AMBIANCE:

PRO: They sell Bollywood movies here. Very casual vibe, no need to worry about what you're wearing when you come in here. 
CON: Probably best to do bring and eat your food at home. This restaurant is more of a take-out food stop."}
{"text":"I keep calling this place Bombay COWPATTY by mistake, which ensues immediate fits of giggling.

Jokes aside, this place puts the BOMB in Bombay. They serve up typical Indian chaats which are snacks served at street stalls in India. 

LG and I ordered some snacks for our takeaway picnic - Veg Pakoras, Samosa Chaats and Paneer Kathi Rolls. The first two were fairly average but the Paneer Kathi Rolls were pretty awesome and unique, I'd eat those again! (Described as \"Mashed paneer sauteed with onions and tomatoes, rolled inside a flakey plain parantha with chutneys\"). 

Whilst waiting for our takeout order, we also oredered a Dahi Bhalla, which was lentil dumplings* served cold slathered in a yoghurt sauce with cumin and cilantro. These were awesome.

I need to go back and try some of the other messier items which the server ensured us would NOT travel well, sigh.

Plain set up inside with plastic chairs, etc - it's definitely a takeaway joint but they do have a nice outdoor patio area.

It's cheap - no dishes over $5.99

*OMG WTF Indian dumplings?!?!?!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty straight up.

No frills.
No pretence. 
No BS.

Just good, Indian street food.

My order was simple - Chana Bhatura and a Limca.
I haven't had a Chana Bhatura since I was a kid, so this was a real treat.

It came with a side of yoghurt, chopped onions with garam masala and chunk of lime pickle.

The chana was laced with some hot green chutney and a mild splash of fresh coriander. It tasted very fresh, mouthwatering with masala, and was right off the stove.

The bhatura was not too greasy and nice and chewy.

My only gripe is that they could have thrown in an extra couple of heaping tablespoons of the chana, as there was too much bhatura to sweep up the chana.

Good job - I am coming back to try something else ... maybe the Samosa Chaat?"}
{"text":"I usually bring my friends from out of town to this spot anytime I'm in the neighborhood. I personally really enjoy their Paneer Burger... it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I hate to compare, but simply put, I think there are better places for chat, pani puri, & chana bhatura in the area. I also wasn't a huge fan of the half video store, half fast food restaurant vibe."}
