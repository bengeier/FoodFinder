{"text":"Had the protein soup. I've had it before at another location, but here it tastes pretty bad. The broth especially tasted old, their noodles weren't cooked right and I had exactly 2 pieces of brocoli. Furthermore, it's supposed to have barley, not ramen noodles (or at least they looked like ramen noodles...)  I thought the point was to sell healthy food... Oh well, waste of 10$. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"As food court fare goes Chop Crazy is decent enough. It provides a nice change from the A&W's and other fast food places by providing a healthy alternative.   One of the biggest let downs to this place is the sales staff. I've visited a few times and every time the staff have been unfriendly and seem to never listen. Today we visited an asked for a rustic Italian dressing but ended up with poppy seed (which was still good but not what we asked for).   The selection is what you would expect from a salad bar: they will make a salad from about 10 or so recipes which come with suggested dressings. You can also have wraps, soups or combos.   Price wise it's a little more than other food court joints. A large salad cost $13 with tax with a can of iced tea. I found this to be slightly more than, for example, Thai Express which is my usual go to food court fast food.  If you're looking for a light lunch that's on the healthy side and tastes pretty good I can recommend Chop Crazy, just don't go out of your way for it."}
{"text":"Not happy with this place. It looked good but watch that they make your food then touch money and cash register without removing gloves. Ensure they take them off from the previous customer. If you order the soup of the day ask to see it first. I was told it was vegetable and the picture on the board looked very hearty, what I got had nothing but broth? When I asked about it they said it was blended in. Tasted blah!"}
{"text":"i dont like this place . the salad is not fresh and its very expensive. a small salad for almost 10$.OMG"}
{"text":"Français plu bas  had a chicken teriaki and salad wraps. One wrap was a ok size, can be fullfilling if not super hungry. It was like 10$ for a wrap. I think it's the max i've paid for a wrpa mainly composed of salad. The concept is quite interesting even though it doesn't look like it's working really well as a franchise. My concerns if it would work would be the time it takes to have a wrap. Basically you choose some pre-done sandwich or you choose what you wants. then they chop-it on a counter designed for that and then complete the wrap once all ingredient were chopped. The franchise has some healthy approach which is the future of successful fast food but like other fastfood you see that it's also with a bunch of compromise. Like the chicken it was seasoned chicken which is basically processed chicken. Ok taste, average size, took so much time to complete ONE wrap and is a bit expensive.  C'est le genre de place ou tu payes 10$ pour un Wrap au poulet avec de la salade. Ouais, c'est un peu dispendieux. Ils sont dans la tendance des nouvelles petites franchises qui veulent s'affirmé dans cette vague de santé/bio/green puis desfois ça donne des truc complètement génial et desfois boff. C'Est plus un scénario boff ici. Le concept C'est que tu choisis ton sandwich ou tu choisis de A a Z tous les ingrédient de ton wrap ou salade. Ensuite y ont une plate designer pour haché tes ingrédient avec un peu de vinaigrette et une fois que c'est bien haché, ils montent ton wrap ou ta salade. Voila, c'Est simple, bien pensée mais le problème c'est le temps que ça prend. Ça ne semble pas marché beaucoup. Je pense surtout en raison du manque de vitesse, du manque de choix en soit et pis surtout parce qu'a part la vinaigrette, ca ne goutte pas grand chose. Le hic c'est principalement que ces places la font souvent des compromis au mauvais endroits. Par exemple, le poulet c'Est du poulet assaisonné. Si vous ne saviez pas, c'est du genre de faux poulet comme au Subway. Bref, c'est pas assez vite, tu fais le tour rapidement et t'as pas le goût nécessairement un gout de revenez-y. C'est ok mais sans plus. une coche trop dispendieux."}
