{"text":"A dear friend gave me a chocolate croissant from Gouter to give to my daughter who is the judge of all chocolate croissants.  Typically we try to count the layers but gave up when the smell of chocolate took over all control.  The best ever!!  Now we have the calendar out in search of a date for a road trip.  Can't wait!  If we are this excited from one croissant between us just think of the girl power when we see the displayed options!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Yorkdale with authentic French pastries by an authentic French chef.  Inside this unassuming old strip on Bathurst Street, Gouter lies amongst a cluster of Jewish specialty stores. But Gouter is anything but kosher; in a good way of course (for those of us who aren't OJ at least).   \"Go√ªter\" is the French word for the verb \"to taste\", but to a native French speaker has many more connotations. One thing is for sure, you won't get a massively inflamed big toe from anything you eat here (Disclaimer: gout flares aren't ever funny).    You may have heard of Chef Rodney Alleguede (RA) from \"Ma Maison\" fame in Etobicoke where he was head pastry chef for over a decade before venturing out on his own to follow his creative ambitions. Thank God he did!   His passion is in chocolate; his truffles to die for. But have you had his authentic Parisian macarons, tarts, and cakes?   The difference in quality will be apparent to you immediately. High grade ingredients in the hands of a professional with true genius.   Pasteries and breads are baked fresh every day. The chef is always on premises to answer any questions. He also gladly drops everything to personally consult with you on custom orders, helps plan out catering and even does ANY size custom cakes. He should be a florist as well since he clearly knows how to incorporate fresh flowers into his art.  When I don't have time to go to France, this is the next best thing. I will go there on weekends from Oakville. Worth the trip everytime. He will par-bake anything so you can take it home. Store these goodies in your freezer for those chilly winter nights when you want to make a baguette in your own oven, in the comfort  of your home. Make sure you grab some croissants as well. Enjoy both with Chef Alleguede's savory and rich pate, all made in house. Buy extra, or you'll find yourself scraping the empty jar wishing you had more... Not a good scene.   You must try the chocolate croissants and eclairs. Buttery and warm with smooth cocoa to compliment. When chocolate and pasteries meet, Chef Alleguede shines. I wish he would hire a sommelier to pair some red wines in house. If this happens, I might rent the place upstairs.   Also, they make their own ice cream in house from fresh cream. You can request flavors, or even buy a whole tub to indulge at home.  The Barista serves fresh ground and pressed coffee, which makes this an unbeatable place to stop by first thing in the morning. The coffee is amazingly strong French roast that begs to be consumed with something sweet and rich. Wonder where we could find that?  Do yourself a favour... Matter fact, do DJ Khaled a favour... Go check out Gouter and taste something different and special.   Anyways, diabetes can kiss my tarte tatin!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and well prepared pastries.  The raspberry croissant was such a treat, and the lemon tart  has a sweet-tart creamy curd filling that was a lovely complement to the shortcrust pastry.   Limited seating, but a clean and welcoming atmosphere, and very pleasant service.  We would gladly drive across the city to sample their wares again!"}
{"text":"Beautiful store, delicious product.  Their danishes, croissants, that kouign amann, oh my, there is obvious care and quality here.  Prices are very fair based on what you're getting.  I walked out with 5 or 6 danishes/croissant/chocolate thing and a baguette and it was $20. They also have a pretty extensive chocolate selection that is of an equally high standard.   Some really nice Easter chocolate was on display today, and they have Propeller coffee too.  Wishing them well, although the location is not going to help them, this store is really more suited to Avenue Road, but they can be a trailblazer towards the improvement of Bathurst Street!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the search for the best croissants in Toronto.  My standard is Tartine in San Francisco and Colette used to be my favourite downtown.  Gouter has gotten into my top ratings.  Very light, fluffy, nice layering.  The almond was light and the almond paste very almondy and not too sweet.  Pricing was reasonable too.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday and it wasn't busy.  Pros: - Nice ambiance - Good service - Seating area - Parking   Cons: - A little pricey for what's offered"}
{"text":"Well, I went for macaron....which I had a groupon for.  Once I took them out of the fridge and let them come to room temperature, they were light and tasty.  Although not a lot of flavours to choose from.  I hadn't had lunch, so I had a ham and cheese sandwich, which was good.  I bought a couple of individual desserts.  The caramel dream, which was amazing.  The opera cake, which was very dry and a huge disappointment.  The intense au chocolate was very good.  For the prices, which are high at $6 for an individual dessert, I expect perfection, and this wasn't close.  There are much, much better French pastry shops, like Patisserie 27 on Jane, a few blocks north of Bloor, or the French Corner on Dundas in West Mississauga, I'm afraid."}
