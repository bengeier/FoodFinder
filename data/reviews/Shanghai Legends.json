{"text":"I went to the First Markham Food court during the lunch hour rush and picked this place b/c it didn't have a line. (That should've ringed a bell). Regardless, I ordered the Lion heads (essentially giant meat balls) with vegetable rice. The order came to $6, came with a bottle of water, and cooked fast! 

Apart from whether it was genuine Shanghainese flavours, I think the portion size is relatively small. From their picture, you would expect 4 medium sized meatballs, but it ended up coming to 4 halves of 2 meatballs. 

Would try their other meals only when I get really sick of the other places at the food court."}
{"text":"Daughter ordered the ubiquitous Noodle Soup with Beef and Spinach and thought it was delicious. I would've given this place 4 stars but knocking 1 off because when we asked for a box to go, we got charged 10 cents for it. Lucky for her she didn't ask for 20 cents!"}
{"text":"It is never easy to make up my mind what I want to eat when I am at First Markham Place. Aside from all the sit down restaurants, there are also numerous choices in the food court itself.

Shanghai Legends is located inside the food court of First Markham Place.  I got attracted by the signs of the promise of an awesome tasting traditional Beef Noodle Soup.

Beef Noodle Soup ($6.42) with a choice of drink was a little disappointing. The broth itself though was decently good with great beef flavour. The beef too was quite tender. The noodle itself was meh.. as store brought noodles was used and was over cooked and resulted with no texture and bite....

I might need to try out other dishes that Shanghai Legends offers before I can really write it off. Maybe some dumplings and dim sums next time?"}
