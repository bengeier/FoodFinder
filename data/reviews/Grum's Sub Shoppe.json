{"text":"Even though I live in San Francisco now, every time I make a trip to Cleve-OH for whatever reason, I make it a point to not only stop at Grum's, but take a sandwich or two with me. I've had almost everything on the menu and my favorites are the Grumsteer (hot or cold) and the Hamshire. This place is the single most thing I miss about Cleveland.  And for those of you who knocked down stars for lack of place to sit - yes, it sucks that there's no place to sit. I'll add that I hate that parking around the corner at the C-store is a slippery slope. But here's my little secret - take your food and go across the street to the cemetary. On a spring, summer, or fall day, you can sit on a lovely grassy knoll (respectfully, of course) or at a picnic bench by the Garfield monument. In the winter, pump your heat up just before cutting the engine, and look outside at the gray, gray sky."}
{"text":"Love the hot Grumster and the Turkey Ridge. Never had a huge problem with the service although it can be a little disgruntled behind the counter at times. As I am sure others have said, the large cold subs are gigantic so always get the half sizes unless you want leftovers (or are a fatty)."}
{"text":"Good sub shop.   You can't sit inside. You pay, leave the store and enjoy elsewhere. Simple.    Parking anywhere in Cleveland Heights is a hassle. I'm amazed that so many people put up with it and that more businesses don't close down because of the prohibitive parking rules and meters. On more than one occasion I have wanted to patronize a Cleveland Heights business but then got frustrated trying but unable to find a reasonable parking spot within a reasonable walking distance and just leave and go somewhere else in a different city with no obnoxious parking meters or parking cops. Rant over.    If you love roast beef you can't go wrong with the hot grumsteer. Huge subs. Good bread. Service was good every time I've been there (which is probably not often enough). Instead of Subway try something local instead. You may be happily surprised."}
{"text":"I loved the \"Black Forest\" hot sandwich (I got it with a whole dill pickle). Deee-licious. The wife got a Sea-Grum's sandwich, which was also tasty-good. Why only 3 stars, then? Like some of the other reviews have said, I was bummed there was no place to sit inside. And being a nice, chilly Cleveland evening, no place nearby either. Give them a try if you're headed somewhere else. Otherwise, skip it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sub shop on Coventry; a street with 3 sub shops represented.  Beats the salad dressing logged subs at Dave's and the terribe bread and mayonaise laiden subs at Jimmy John's everytime.   My favorites are the hard hat, turkey ridge, and grumster.  The bread is great everytime and portions are more than enough.  Tip:  if you ever need to bring an item for a party or are having a party order some Grumms subs and slice into smaller pieces; large sub fills a platter; DONE."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this place, but you can get some great enormous subs.  Best is the Grumsteer with thinly sliced pink roast beef and a great creamy horseradish sauce.  I always get extra horsey sauce.  Usually get the whole sub, which is more than enough for two meals."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the soft, spongy quality of the Italian bread, which should have been a bit crustier, while the overall sandwich construction was unsatisfactory. I ordered The Grum.  Unfortunately it was made more or less just like they do at Subway, splaying open the roll topped with shredded lettuce then rolling the whole thing up which balled up the meat and cheese into a wad in the center when all done. Not the way they used to make them here, stacked in traditional style. I asked for the tomatoes on the side but none were packed up with the order. Adding insult to injury, I phoned in the order ahead of time for pick up but they didn't have my order ready when I arrived so I had to wait in line behind a walk-in order. And that was at 11:15 in the morning, not exactly lunch rush hour. Disinterested staff didn't help."}
{"text":"This place brings back memories. it is a cleveland hts staple and is still good. I usually either get the tuna or yellow sandwich which is a bit vegetarian sub. it's more tasty and more expensive than subway but worth a treat."}
{"text":"grumms is alrigh.t I was never a hard core han myself but I used  to be cool with the manager so they are alright with me. What can I say-its a cleveland staple."}
{"text":"Going to Grum's used to be a weekly occurrence at my house, but for some reason a few years passed without visiting even though I live just minutes away.   I have now started going frequently again! Anytime my mom doesn't feel like cooking, I'm chiming in with \"I'll go pick up some subs if you want!\" (Obviously grabbing Grum's beats cooking dinner every single time).   Pretty much your only option with Grum's is take out because they don't have tables or chairs to eat at. So I always call ahead because then I don't have to sit there and wait. My only complaint is that even though I call ahead and come to pick it up when they tell me to, pretty much every time the order isn't ready. But other than that, they make THE BEST SUBS you can get in Cleveland Heights.   PS. The subs are ENORMOUS I always go with the half size and still have leftovers."}
{"text":"All I have to say is: order a meatball sub with the onions (unless you hate onions or don't have mints) on whole wheat. It'll be in the top 5 meatball subs you've ever had (it's my number 2, number one being at a stand in Breckenridge Colorado)... Anyway, honestly, anything else on their menu is great too. They do a solid job, fresh ingredients, and they are friendly people. Additional random story: one time I went down the street to Dave's Cosmic Subs just to see if their meatball sub was better... Dave's forgot my order (as I was standing there, no joke), and then when it finally came out it tasted terrible. Your last option for subs on Coventry would be Jimmy John's. Grum's is the best sub shop(pe) on the street for sure!"}
{"text":"Compared to the Grum's in Coventry, this place doesn't come close.  The inside feels like you are walking into what I would imagine a Russian bakery would feel like during the cold war.  Sparse and lacking in imagination.  The people working there reflect the decor to you as well- they are about the most unhappy people I think I have ever met.    That being said, the subs are still pretty good, but I do think that the Grum's in Coventry taste better.  Not sure why- probably the same ingredients, maybe it is just how they are put together or something?  This place is great if you are in the area, need a quick sandwich (because there is never a line here) and need to keep moving.    Keep in mind that their large sub is about 2 feet long.  I have put a couple down myself, but don't need to eat the rest of the day.  The Turkey Ridge is one of the best subs, but my buddy always gets the hot subs which he swears by."}
{"text":"Good food made quick. When you want something a little diffrent. I will go there next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The best sub shop ever!  Hands down.  We live in St. Louis but are from Cleveland.  My husband went to Case Western and we ate at Grum's all the time.  He just went on a college visit with my son and they brought back a Grumster.  It was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"The Grumster is a classic.  Big.  Overstufffed.  Enough for four people.  Ask for it hot also ... they'll always throw in some extra horseradish sauce if you ask nicely."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall sub shop with Midwestern knickknacks and decor! (I believe there is a deer head on the wall?)  Somewhat grumpy and grouchy service, but don't let that deter you from getting a delicious sandwich. I'm mostly commenting on the vegetarian sandwich, hence the 3 star rating. I'm sure the meat ones are very good.  I didn't feel compelled by the veggie one. The vegetables kept falling out, and there wasn't very good flavor. I think they just tried to mask it with melted cheese, but that didn't really do it for me. The bread did get a little soggy, and I wish it was crustier.   Anyway, Grum's is legendary in Cleveland, so I would suggest trying it for yourself. It's just not at the top of my list for vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Great subs, great atmosphere, loaded with character, a local institution....and the service is good the times I have been there.  Much better than any sub chain."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are pretty good.   They are not afraid to load you up with cheese and sauce on the meatball sub, or tons of slices of meat on the cold cut style sandwiches.  These things are huge, and the sandwiches they say can serve two people can really fill three. The downside is there is no space to eat indoors here, nor many places to take it nearby."}
{"text":"I don't know what is in the spices on the turkey ridge, but whatever it is, it makes the sandwich addicting and amazing.  A whole sandwich can feed you for at least 2 meals (and keep you full for a good day and a half!).  The bread is crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle, and the sandwiches are loaded with meat and cheese.  Absolutely delicious!   This place is a Coventry staple and it's weird to me that no one talks about it... People should certainly start!"}
{"text":"I came here about a week ago. We came near closing, and the counter guys were incredibly courteous and accommodating. My boyfriend and I each had a half-sub - I had a half portion of the Gamooza Grum. The sub was good, but seemed pretty standard fare, and I felt that for the size, it was a touch expensive.   My biggest problem with this establishment was a lack of vegetarian options; I suppose I could just make my own sub, but I really respect shops that try to hard to accommodate people who, for whatever reason, don't wish to eat meat. Not counting the salads (because honestly, most people can throw some vegetables into a bowl without too much of a problem) or sides, I saw two vegetarian meal options, which was pretty disappointing. There are many ways to make a sub, and every sub does not need to have meat on it.  In addition, there is room in the lobby for one or two tables, but the space seems kind of wasted the way it's set up, and there's little seating (and no tables at all!) in the shop. I would love for the available space to be used in a way that encourages diners to sit, even if for just long enough to eat their sub, and enjoy the casual feel of the place; again, when I visited, there were two really great guys running it, but the lack of furniture left me with little desire to just sit and eat.  That being said, I will probably revisit this establishment and try the other vegetarian sub because I had a pretty good experience, but I won't be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"We were provided with a free lunch today, which was exciting.  Then, we were told we could only order a half sandwich, and were kind of disappointed.  As it turns out, a half sandwich at Grum's is HUGE and our disappointment was misplaced.  I had the \"All American,\" which is ham, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, and banana peppers.  The quality of the ingredients very good, and I really liked their seasoning mix.  However, it's a TON of bread, which makes it a little bit dry.  I don't know if I've ever said this about a sandwich before, but this might've actually benefited from just a bit of mayo.  If I go again, I'm hoping to try one of the the hot subs.  Prices are actually pretty reasonable-- $6.60 for a huge seven inch \"half\" sandwich and around $12 for what must be a ridiculously large whole sandwich-- so as it turns out, Grum's is worth getting excited about."}
{"text":"Hands down the single best neighborhood sub shop in Cleveland. Actually, it just might be the best in all of Northeast Ohio. Over the 12 years I lived in Cleveland Heights I visited Grum's innumerable times all with positive results. They've got hot subs (go for the Hamshire - pure porcine bliss), cold subs, full-sized deli pickles, and local Cleveland appeal. My standard order is the Turkey Ridge on wheat. The ingredients are fresh and I've never had a disappointing experience. And don't expect whimpy subs at Grum's. The half is over 7\" and the full is 16\". They are huge and for only $6 a half or $12 a whole very affordable. I'm pretty sure you can feed a family of five with the whole.  If your so inclined you can also treat yourself to a french bread style pizza, salad or all-beef hot dog. I know, why the hell would you ever go to Grum's for something other than one of their famous sandwiches? Different strokes for different folks.   As others have stated Grum's is a get it to go place. There are a couple of park benches to sit on while you wait patiently for your order but that's it. They've also got a few racks with some munchies but you're better off heading to the mini mart next door for that stuff. As for parking, it's really not that big of a deal. There are several options like the garage down the block, street spots, and the lot next door for the mini mart.  Skip Subway and go to Grum's. Support your local businesses. I know you're thinking \"but it's just a sub\". If you are thinking that it's because you've never had one. Do yourself and your soul a favor and grab one today."}
{"text":"This little shop on the corner of Coventry and Mayfield makes great subs. The bread is good, especially the wheat, all of the ingredients are fresh, they add a seasoning that adds an extra punch of flavor, and the subs are huge! The prices seem a bit steep until you realize that one large sub can feed 2, maybe even 3 people.  Parking can be tough on the street, but there's a garage right down the road. If you're in the mood for a quick, satisfying bite to eat, Grum's will do the trick (and might have you covered for lunch tomorrow, too)."}
{"text":"I have been coming to grums for many years and the last few times I've been here it wasn't so great the first time the bread was totally bad tasted like mold and fell apart once I took a bite out of it, the next time I got the turkey ridge and after I ate it I got very sick felt like food poisoning. It's good to a lot of people it's just not for me. But i do love the simplicity and the service is very nice."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place for over a year and didn't know it was there. There's no sign , its hidden behind trees, nobody ever mentions it nor recommends it. Until today. Heard it was in business for 30 years. Had no idea. Their 6 inch subs are actually 7.5 inches. Amazingly fresh. Fresh bread and fresh ingredients. No seats, no restrooms. You're carrying it home,, buddy. Its kind like an old school Little Caesars except no pizza. If your over 42 you'll get why Best place in town to get a sub. Ill bet you twenty bucks. The 15 inch grum has smoked ham, capicola, genoa salami, lettuce, tomato, onion, hot banana pepper rings, provolone cheese, & spices. Delicious. The Grumster has roast beef, lettuce, tomato, onions, provolone cheese, horseradish sauce and spices. Check out the full menu on the Yelp menu page."}
{"text":"This business is confirmed closed.  (Will submit edit.)  The space is currently under renovation (cutting into Shinano's Restaurant) and will be reopened as another branch of Joey's Restaurant (from Chagrin Falls)."}
{"text":"Here's a tip from me. Want a bone-sticking lunch that won't leave you hungry at 3 o'clock? Go to Grum's.  Here's another one: Want a sandwich that is über tasty in it's simplicity and fresh ingredients? Go to Grum's.  Since I used to live in Cleveland Heights, I realize that it's not only annoying to get over there from downtown, but it's also impossible to find parking. Grum's is one of those sub shops that I'd set aside my impatience and laziness for. Seriously.   Drive over to Coventry. Park your car in the garage. Go get a sub from this Cleveland landmark. You won't regret or forget it...mostly because you'll be full for the next day and a half.   Also, I have to admit that I may have lived off of Grum's for a month or two... only because I was broke and one sub would give me leftovers for days."}
{"text":"They are the worst. Very rude and so is Irene the owner. I will never go back!!!!! I don't know how they've been in business so long, when even the owner doesn't treat customers well?"}
{"text":"The smell of Grums reminds me of my younger years, when I would stroll up the hill from my Alma Mater to inhale one of these amazing sandwiches after a late night.  The Turkey Ridge on wheat is quite a quality sub.  It's massive, and topped off with the Grums Spices.  It's a simple sandwich, but some of the most beautiful things in the world are simple - wouldn't you say?   Back in the day, I could take down a half in one sitting.  It's sad how age ruins your speed eating capabilities.  Now, I'm splitting the small into two meals, which makes this place a no-brainer for the price.  If your fridge is empty - head to Grums!  Well worth the drive into the heights.  This neighborhood sub shop does it right!"}
{"text":"I was very sad to see this place EMPTY, as I'm a huge fan of the Coventry location, but now I think I know why.   The sandwiches are just as great as Coventry (so please go give them business!!), but the employees could smile a tad more. I tried to make not one, but two super lame jokes to get the guy to smile, and got nothing...   Also - they had 4 bags of chips out on a huge display. It got the feeling like they'd just given up on trying to make money. They could put in a little more effort."}
{"text":"Stopped in for my first time after friends raved about Grum's excellent subs! I purchased the turkey sub. My girlfriend bought the meatball one.  We both sat on the couch and ate. Barely a single word was spoken. Mouth... too busy to chat.  Will return!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim with a friend, and boy were we surprised!  The small sub was more that I could eat in one sitting. (Bang for your buck!) Sandwich was simple, fresh ingredients, bread was better than most places, and the Grum's spices added a great flavor. The menu isn't huge, but I look forward to trying more of the sandwiches.   Service was ok, the guys working had a good attitude, and the place was clean. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Subs in the area. Been going there since they opened. The Grum sandwich is unique in that it comes with no mayo, mustard or oil of any type. Their quality of meats (capicolla ham is amazing) & herbs is what sets them apart. Take away 1 star for them changing the bread vendor several years ago but I've gotten used to the new taste which still is head & shoulders above the recent chain sub shops populating the area."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the hot turkey sub. Its fresh ingredients and secret spice make for a filling meal. The whole sub feed 2-3 people. Price is great."}
{"text":"I've gone to Grums many times over the last 10 years-- their subs are very good for the price and the size. I particularly like the \"Hot Grumster\" and used to get it at least once a month to fulfill a craving. I've stopped going to Grums in the last couple of years, though, because the service is just terrible.   Every time I call to place an order, someone picks up the phone to take my order with a tone like they're chained to the wall, being forced to make sandwiches in forced labor. They don't care and it's very unnerving. I've returned over and over again, hoping that the next time will prove different and that I'll interact with someone who actually cares, even a little bit. It never happens. It's disappointing, considering how long they've been there (since the 70s, I believe?).   They also have a very bizarre \"no orders over $12 after 5pm\" rule, which makes no sense to me considering they close at 10pm and almost all of the subs ARE $12.   Again. The subs are good. The service? Terrible. And with that, I'm choosing to take my business elsewhere moving forward. Order at your own risk."}
{"text":"We ordered a few subs last night to go. They were incredibly tasty. The prices were perfect and the subs were HUGE! I couldn't finish mine, so my husband took it for lunch today. One thing that was a little disappointing was the potato salad. it tasted store bought, you guys serve these epicly awesome subs with not so epic potato salad. all in all it was an awesome experience and we will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"So, I freely admit I might be a bit biased from my days of sneaking out of elementary school during lunch and heading down the hill for a sandwich bigger than my 9 year old self could ever hope to handle.  But, I just had one and I still think this place makes a damn good sandwich.  Usually the bread is super freash and tasty.  Whatever secret spices they put on the Turkey Ridge to make a turkey sandwich so addicting is beyond me.  The Hot Grumsteer with the creamy horseradish sauce is also really good.  This is definitely a place anyone who visits Cleveland Heights should check out."}
{"text":"I've returned once or twice since my first visit and did not have any issues with stringy roast beef so it must have just been a fluke. It's definitely a good sandwich and I will return whenever the craving strikes!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I get crazy weird cravings for things and this week it was sandwiches. I could not stop myself from thinking about bread, cheese and deli meat! It was weird, but no weirder than the week I was obsessed with turkey hot dogs, or the week I only wanted to eat cold cereal.  I have lived on the east side for a long time (almost 10 years!) and had embarrassingly never, ever set foot in Grum's despite hearing from various people that it is a good place to grab a sandwich.  So I went there after work yesterday, and I ordered myself a sandwich.   And it was amazing.  It was just a turkey sub, but it was executed pretty dang well. First of all, even the small sub is a big sub. Two servings for me! The bread was crusty yet soft, the turkey was, well, it was lunchmeat, but the sub seasoning and the proportion of mayo? Perfect, in my opinion.  You must note that I really, really like mayo.  The only thing that was missing from my sandwich were dill pickle chips. Those would have made it completely perfect. They did not come with the sandwich I ordered, but I'm pretty sure I could have asked for them. I just forgot. I was so excited about having a sandwich for dinner!  Some other reviewers complained about the parking around Coventry and the fact that you can't eat-in at Grum's. I found neither of these things to be an issue and in fact scored a very sweet 15-minute space outside the shop. I think there is usually a police cruiser parked there, but not yesterday!   And while it was difficult to keep from tearing into the brown paper bag that contained my sandwich while I was driving home, I managed and ended up just sitting in my living room watching TV and shoving a sandwich in my face a mere 10 minutes after leaving the store, which is just about perfect, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over 15 years. Good food. Love the Grumsteer with a really cold one!  Try the soups too."}
{"text":"I have only had one sandwich here and it's the Turkey Ridge. It's so good I've been reluctant to try anything else, but I am sure they are all just as delicious. Whatever mix of seasoning and spices they put on the turkey ridge is what keeps me going back.   They have both cold and hot sandwiches. No seating. Some chips and a pop machine, but there is a convenience store right next door so you can get your drinks and chips there for a better price and selection of need be."}
{"text":"So the customer service was a little off. I called at 8 pm on a Saturday to place a pick up order and was told they don't take phone orders an hour before close. A little odd, but OK. I walk over and their posted hours say they're open until 10 pm on Saturdays. Since there wasn't a line it only took a few minutes to get the sub in the end anyway and it was fantastic.  I got the Black Forest. I think it was a little too heavy on the lettuce, but I basically inhaled the sub. The meats were wonderful. The price was great. It's a little upsetting actually since it's about a 2 minute walk from my house. I'm tempted to go back today.   I was going to take off a star cause of the customer service but the sub was so good, I can't justify that."}
{"text":"Sadly, I did not love this place like I had hoped to from reading everyone else's reviews. I ordered the hot turkey ridge... I think they call it Zach's Hot Turkey, with the onions on side (didn't add them in the end because they were raw). The bread was soggy, wayyy too much mayo, too much turkey meat, not enough spice. It is a large sandwich, but it underwhelmed me. I felt like I was eating a Jimmy John's turkey sandwich without the alfalfa sprouts on soggy french bread. Maybe I ordered wrong? Who knows.  I give the food one star, and then another star just because the people working there were so nice. The guy who took my order reminded the guy who gave me the sandwich that I wanted onions on the side."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few weeks now, and have developed an unhealthy addiction to their Hot Grumster...a roast-beef , cheese, and horseradish monster of a sub. It's like eating a small child. No need to order the \"large\"-sized sub....unless you happen to weigh 350-pounds, have furry paws and silly ears, and plan to spend the next six months hibernating in a hollow tree stump.  The preferred side dish here at Grum's are the tater-tots. The tots are surprisingly good...there's a secret ingredient that I cannot place...something almost sweet. Big, juicy tots. Nice tots.   The staff is curious. They all look like Phish refugees. Dreadlocks appear to be mandatory. It's kinda relaxing...but at the same time, confusing. Did I come here to buy drugs...or lunchmeat? But they're all nice guys and appear to have showered recently with something more sophisticated than a garden hose, so I don't mind their company while I wrestle with my oversized sandwich.  Anyhow, this new place is sadly devoid of patrons, so stop by, get some tots, and pet the hippies so they don't have to go back to selling beads and narcotics from a van. The subs are a bit pricey, but you won't have to eat again for a whole week, so they're a bargain."}
{"text":"I had Grum's the other week. I always get the large and eat one half now, the other half later. I forgot how much I really like the subs here. They are basic subs and the beauty is in their simplicity. I walked in and heard the newest Action Bronson album playing. The gentleman behind the counter started chatting it up about new music and gave me a decent recommendation. We both agreed that Roc Marciano is one of the best out of the newly revived NYC scene. Very nice people working here and excellent subs make this one of my favorite places to go for a quick sandwich on the go."}
{"text":"On  Monday NOV. 4 at 7:00 , I got a very delicious tuna sub at Grum's on Coventry.  This purchase prompted  me to return on Nov. 7 in anticipation of another delicious tuna sub. This sub was the complete opposite - mushy, devoid of much tuna, lots of mayo with no discernible chopped veggies. I called to express my disappointment and was met with an insincere \"sorry\". Why the difference in quality ?? It was clear that the person I spoke to didn't want my business!"}
{"text":"Great classic sub shop. Menu hasnt changed in 40 years....and thats a good thing. A cleveland institution."}
