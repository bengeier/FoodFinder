{"text":"Incredibly fresh and tasty, great value and my go-to for shish taouk, tabouleh and all lebanese specialties.
Best around."}
{"text":"Very fast delivery! Two shish taouk plates with two drinks for a total of 32$
The chicken tastes amazing !!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Lebanese places for sure. As a fan of falafel, I have to say I don't love their falafel, but it really is not bad.
I do love their salads. Fresh and always a great variety.
My son & fianc√© love the chicken and the beef. I am a huge fan of their salads.
What sets this place apart is beyond exceptional friendly service. The 2 owners are courteous, kind, and want you to enjoy.
Nice clean place with reliable food and well priced for the large portion you get. You will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"For about $1-2 more than a generic falafel joint, you get courteous service, fresh ingredients, a very clean space (even real cutlery and placemats). I ended up not liking the salads too much, but honestly I would just get a green salad/veggies with my plate or grab a wrap. Yay for finding places that deliver to home!"}
{"text":"The beef is extremely tender. Huge portion. Friendly. I'd say it stands out a bit from the generic similar restos out there"}
