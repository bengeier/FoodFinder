{"text":"If you like or love sushi, DO NOT eat here. My best friend and I ate here for dinner tonight despite the bad reviews thinking the good reviews would prevail and they didn't. We first walked in and I immediately felt that it was a little warmer than I'd like the temp to be in a restaurant let alone a sushi restaurant. We got seated pretty quick and the service was a little over solicited. The edamame could have been in better shape, a lot of the pods were missing beans and they tasted a little like dirty dish water. The crab puffs were just gross, they tasted like they had freezer burn and honestly seemed as if they were store bought not fresh at all. The avocado roll was basic because it was just a basic roll and it lived up to what it was. The tootsie roll, shrimp tempura roll and tataki roll all had a funny taste to them like the ingredients that was used to make them was about to turn, as in go bad. The only thing that was stellar about this place was the Sprite I had to drink and one Kirin my friend had to drink. The temp in the restaurant kept getting warmer and finally I saw an employee go to the thermostat and turn down the setting to get the air conditioner on and then when it finally started cooling down, I saw another employee right back over to the thermostat and turn the setting up to make the air conditioner turn off. Makes you think, Arizona on a summer night and a sushi restaurant, you might want it to be cool for the customers to enjoy their meal. Obviously this place is NEVER again. We ate the avocado roll but left half of the tootsie roll, half of the shrimp tempura roll and more than half of the tataki roll. Perhaps that's why it took so long to get our check, they must have thought we were still \"working\" on our \"food\". I honestly think that $60 with tax and tip was way over priced for the lackluster food that we received. I truly feel cheated and I want my money back."}
{"text":"I love Japanese food especially Sashimi. The Sashimi Combination plate was outstanding. The slices of fish were generous and tasted of freshness. This will definitely be my go to place for Japanese food."}
{"text":"DELISH!! Very yummy! We were so pleased to find this charming little spot. As others have said, yes, it really is better than the place across the street. The service was great and the fish was tasty. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IN TOWN. It's the only place I go. My friends and I love Fresh Wasabi. And $5.95 sake bombs...YUM!"}
{"text":"NOT EVEN A FRACTION as good as the one on 67th and Bell. Service stinks!"}
{"text":"we go almost every other week with our granddaughter. i have never had anything i did not enjoy. the staff makes us feel like family. if you like great food and great service, then this is the place to be.  thanks to all who work there for making us feel special."}
{"text":"Terrible service....to bad because the food is good.  We got there about 4 pm.  The place was empty. A lady came from the back of the place with food in her mouth. Made some signals with her hands leting us know where we could be seated. She gave us the menus and never came back.... more than 15 min waiting for service in an emty restaurant........very sad..."}
{"text":"We've eaten here four times now, and have tried most of the things on the menu (rolls, sushi, sashimi, hamachi, udon, etc.). It's all very good, and the friendly management is a bonus. It's much better than the location would lead you to expect, and WAY better than the fancier Japanese restaurant across Bell Rd.

And how can you beat a big bottle of Sapporo plus a crock of sake for $5.95???"}
{"text":"Good place for sushi. Everything was very fresh and the presentation was beautiful.  The only suggestion I would make would be to have a small children's menu."}
{"text":"Finally got out to try this place, had a restaurant.com coupon for about 6 months and wanted to check them out, but we always were going to be in the area on a Sunday and they are not open then.

First, the entry was pleasant, greeted and seated, the owner/manager was very friendly and made a point to stop by and talk. Granted, they were not very busy late on a Friday night, but that wasn't the point. Decor was ok, had a game on the TV in the background.

Food was good, staff was ok, they do need to update the menu, discovered a minor mistake on something they no longer offer, but we thought the prices were decent anyhow.

IF I'm in the area and craving sushi, I'd stop by again, need I say more?"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Great value, nice staff, extensive roll menu.  All-around good experience!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife tried this place for our 5 year anniversary and we were really surprised at the quality and presentation of the sushi. The service was fast and friendly and the restraunt was clean. We used the $15 for $25 deal and it was great it was like getting a specialty roll for free. Definitly going back cause there's so much left to try. Highlights were the spider roll ( possibly the best soft shell crab I've ever had ) and the ginger was the real deal not the crappy pink stuff."}
{"text":"We went the other night and was not impressed.  We noticed all new faces and after a little digging we found out that it is now under new ownership.  For the most part the sushi was still pretty good, the baked lobster roll was not up to the standard of past visits.  But what stood out the most was the poor service.  I don't know if it is due to all new people or if they are new to the restaurant business in general, but food service was slow, they forgot to put in the order for the kids, it just seemed very unorganized.  We will probably give them another try, but they do have some ground to make up.  Definitely not the fans we were before."}
{"text":"Sushi in Surprise? Woohoo! My husband and I were just here on Saturday and discovered their lunch special: $1 (per piece) select nigiri and select rolls 3 for $11.95. Their special rolls are reasonably priced as well, ranging from $7.95 to $12.00. The fish was very fresh, not fishy at all, and the avocadoes didn't have a spec of brown on them. The albacore tuna nigiri was probably my favorite, definitely worth trying. There wasn't one that i didn't like! 

The ambiance of the restaurant is nothing to rave about. They have 1 TV that didn't seem to be working (they were trying to set it up for the Cardinals playoff game). Service was ok, although it did take a decent amount of time to get the dishes out. I didn't really mind though because the food was good. By about 1:30 the place had filled up! I can't imagine how it is at dinner time. I really liked this place and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in town. Hiyasahi Hibachi used to be the best, but the new owners ruined it. Uni sushi is not even close I won't waste anymore time or money there and I have only been once. Fresh Wasabi makes great rolls, they don't fall apart and they are flavorful. The only \"issue\" I have ever had here was they charged my card for $700 for a $30 purchase and they immediately fixed it and even went farther to make up for it. Great customer service and food."}
{"text":"I am a bit picky on my sushi rolls and they catered to my every wish.  Excellent and fresh as well.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Staff is great food is AWESOME! I love this place .... They are so welcoming even hug some frequent customers. 1 time a different female served us she was not the nicest but still love the place she not there too much ... Highly recommended !! Most items are big enough for two people to share 
I love this place my boyfriend and I both do!!"}
{"text":"Just go. You'll be glad you did. Great selection, fresh, quality fish and creativity. Poppers and special fried avacado highlight kitchen skills too. Have not tried other kitchen food but suspect it is well prepared. Been twice. Will go again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed was looking froward to a nice dinner at 8:10 pm on Sunday night only to be told once I walked in the door they were closed. This is the second time this has happened to my wife and I at Fresh Wasabi.
They closed an hour earlier  than their posted sing on the door or web site. I guess they don't need the business (they are not cheep). I will not take a third strike nor go back. Better call before you go!"}
{"text":"We decided to try a few take-out rolls before eating a meal at Fresh Wasabi.  The person who took my order by phone was very accomodating and helpful, the rolls were ready at the time I requested and the staff was nice in person as well.  The restaurant seemed very clean, too.
We took the 5 different rolls to a friends house as appetizers and we all agreed that they were very good.  We would all definitely go back and eat at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"my mother and I have been coming to this resturant since it opened. we have never had bad experience with customer care or quality of food."}
{"text":"My wife and I really like this place. Great sushi for good value."}
{"text":"I bought the deal offered and the free appetizer was worth the check in.  Not the best sushi for lunch."}
{"text":"I am so happy our town finally has a Sushi Bar.  The sushi chef has been doing this for most of his life, beginning his career in Seattle.  They shop the world for the best fresh fish and have great creations.  If you don't see what you like, just tell them and they will create rolls for you.  Great customer service.  Rolls are reasonably priced. Tell Iris that Jim and Mollie sent you."}
{"text":"Their deep fried rolls are amazing! The yakisoba and teriyaki were light and fresh. We came with a coupon for our first visit and were pleasantly surprised. We really enjoyed ourselves and will return."}
{"text":"Best sushi and customer service ever! The rolls are the best i have had. The ladies and sushi chefs are awesome and very friendly. The prices are very reasonable. Everything i have eaten there is always good."}
{"text":"I liked it! We arrived during happy hour ( 2:30-4:30 pm) so the prices were about a $1.50 cheaper then a favorite sushi bar 15 min away. We were the only ones in the place so it would be hard to critique the service. I'll be visiting again as it's close- food was good, place was clean, food was good"}
{"text":"I was in town with a buddy of mine from college and I had recommended grabbing some sushi for dinner. Searching from my iPhone the closest place was Fresh Wasabi so we gave it a shot. It's a very quaint space, very personal. One of the first things we noticed was the TV behind the sushi bar that was a direct feed from the camera hovering over the main chef while he made these elegant sushi pieces. Needless to say, it was something really cool to see done and I was really impressed by that. 

The next thing I'll note is that the man who was our server (and who I presumed to be the owner) could not have been a nicer guy. They have a special there that if you bring a \"sushi virgin\" with you, you get a roll on the house. This was 100% correct as the man hooked my buddy up with a free roll, and it wasn't the least expensive roll we ordered, but he picked the most expensive one to give us free of charge! Talk about a nice guy and great service. 

Now on to the sushi itself. Their selection of specialty rolls was quite impressive (I recommend the Alaska, Arizona, and Sunset rolls) and they did well to keep the classics well made as well. 

The one gripe I will say is that since there was only one sushi chef working it did take a little longer than I would have hoped to get our food but it wasn't an overly excessive wait to where I got upset and/or restless. 

So overall, I had a very positive experience with Fresh Wasabi and recommend it to anyone who loves some quality sushi at an extremely reasonable price. I'll definitely be back the next time I swing back down to the area."}
{"text":"Came to Bento Box Fresh Wasabi for lunch and the place was very clean and well appointed. The bento box specials are what attracted us to try the place, and they more then lived up to our expectations. We were pleasantly surprised to find our salmon teriyaki bento came with a full piece of salmon, and one of the better pieces of fish I have had. We also had two rolls which were also part of a lunch special - shrimp tempura and tootsie roll. I couldn't try any of the sushi since I am currently prego, but the rolls were great. For a little neighborhood spot, it is great and we will definitely be back for a lunch or casual night out. Great bang for the buck and good food."}
{"text":"Sushi was okay. It didnt taste as fresh as I would have liked and maybe that was because of the temperature of it. The owner was very friendly and its just a small simple place but i would not recommend to go for any of the simpler rolls. Only get specialty bc the imitation crab in the California for example was very disappointing. Also not a great alcohol selection. Basic beers and house wines available, but luckily they did have Blue Moon. Sake bombs are cheap and definitely worth it! Had no problems using the yelp deal though. Maybe i'll return sometime, not sure."}
{"text":"Fresh Wasabi has great food, especially if you love sashimi, and a friendly, helpful and patient staff.  Their sushi chefs are artisans and make me fall in love with sushi each and every visit."}
{"text":"Hands down a must visit every time I'm on the West side. Even though I live on the East side of Phoenix, I've been here twice already in just the past few weeks - every time I've been here it's been a great experience. They obviously care very much about their business and everyone's experience here. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra dollar on the fresh wasabi with your rolls, you won't regret it. Great vibe, they treat you like family and feed you like it too. 10/10!"}
{"text":"I am visiting from California for one week and so glad I found Fresh Wasabi in Surprise!  I was there early evening on a Tuesday night. The owner greeted me and actually made me feel that I was dining at a friend's house. The service was flawless and the food spectacular. I ordered the Cherry Blossom Role and it was delicious. The salmon sushi was the freshest, sweetest fish I have eaten at a sushi bar in a long time. I fly this afternoon back to Ca. and I will eat at Fresh Wasabi again before I drive to the airport!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a sushi restaurant in Surprise. Rolls are okay, if a little boring. Would like greater variety and creativity. Fish is fresh. Happy Hour is a good time to go to see if you like it. Wish we had more sushi options in Surprise."}
{"text":"My husband wrote this review, but I wholeheartedly concur:

This venue is a favorite of ours, not just because the sushi is excellent, but because we are so well taken care of that we are made to feel like family.  To start, the lighting is plentiful without being too bright, and the seating always makes each table feel like an intimate setting.  The service is quick, professional and courteous.  The presentation of your food by the servers is not made into a show, as though the servers are focused on bringing your order without interrupting the microcosm you've created at your table with your guests.  Drinks are always full, often without us noticing when they've been refilled.  As to the food, we have NEVER had a bad meal here.  As often as we've eaten here and as much of the fish as I've eaten, I've never gotten sick, which tells me that their sushi prep area is fastidiously clean.  My wife always orders the gyoza and chicken teriyaki plate and is never disappointed with taste or portion size.  I've taken to handing her the sushi menu when we order and letting her pick.  I've had every roll on the menu, from a simple California roll to the baked lobster and scallop roll.  I'm a fan of spicy Asian cuisine and the chefs always find a way to spice it up without changing what the roll should taste like.  No matter how outlandish the roll may seem, it's never over- or under-dressed with sauces.  All in all, this place will remain our favorite local spot; it's like an Asian Cheers for us: they always know our name, and we're glad to go there.  

Sincerely,

Chrys B."}
{"text":"The sushi here is amazing.  Had the Red Dragon Roll, Dynamite Roll, and Tempura Mix with a Sake Bomb.  This place is Surprise's best-kept secret."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful friendly people who work there. Food is fantastic and we have a roll named after us that is to die for."}
{"text":"The sushi is really good but the rolls are way too small for the price. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Fresh Wasabe I heard was really good but when I call them for a menu they didn't have one. They don't have a website & the man on the phone was very rude so I don't recommend this place. I even explained to the man on the phone the value of having a website with a menu on it & he just blew me off. No wonder I never see them have too much business."}
{"text":"Our current favorite is the Tootsie Roll. We have tried a few others and they too were good.  The edamame is average.  I would suggest trying the Monkey Brain appetizer. It is their version of a stuffed mushroom.

We found the Happy hour deals were better for us than the Lunch specials. 

I have been looking for a good Bim Bim Bap and this place really hit the spot. If you want your rice to sizzle and become crunchy, order the bowl extra hot.  The bowl is also good enough for 2 if you order enough sushi/appetizers.

The restaurant is very clean and the staff very nice. We were so happy and impressed that we went there 2 days in a row.  The second day we brought our kids (5 & 1). They enjoyed it too."}
{"text":"Service was just OK, but when the sushi rolls came out I chuckled because they looked like children sized rolls!!! These were by far the smallest I've ever seen. The rolls were poorly made, the prices were similar to other sushi places but it seemed that they were skimping on the portions. Literally less than bite size. The rice was falling off the nori, and the spicy crab mix tasted like pickle!! I ordered the same amount of sushi rolls I normally do anywhere else and I'M STILL HUNGRY! I was very disappointed. For Sushi lovers, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and the staff are in a great mood. This is my second time and will be back often."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night. The food was good, however, the service was sub par. Understaffed with 1 server and 1 cook. Maybe it was just a bad night for them."}
{"text":"After writing my initial review, I was contacted by the manager of Fresh Wasabi (Billy). He asked that I come back in and order the same thing I ordered on my last visit. He explained that he would cover the bill, and that he wanted prove that the first bad experience was not the normal experience a customer would have. I took him up on his offer last night. I went in and ordered to the best of memory, what we had ordered on our last visit. I ordered 2 pieces of nigiri, a california roll, and their \"Snow White\" Roll. After I ordering I remembered exactly what I disliked on my first visit. Originally the size of the piece of fish on top of the nigiri was quite small. This time, however, if anything, the piece of fish was too big (a good problem to have in my opinion). Next came the california roll. It is a standard california roll, nothing to complain about, very average. The snow white roll is basically a spicy tuna roll topped with a small piece of white tuna and roe with a mustard soy sauce. I didn't care for this roll very much, but it was executed well. I remembered it from the first visit, and I was just not a huge fan of the flavor combination. Finally as an addendum to our order. Billy had us try a new roll. It contained a fried jalepeno and crab in the middle and was topped with siracha and a wasabi mayo. When I read the description, I was thinking it was going to be very spicy. I did not find it extremely spicy though. I found it a little more appealing than the \"Snow White\" roll. It had a similar taste to biting into deconstructed burger (Siracha = Ketchup, wasabi mayo = mayo, rice = bun, crab = meat). Overall, I will probably end up coming back in to the restaurant. I will most likely avoid the specialty rolls as I didn't particularly care for either of them and they are normally $10+ on the menu. However, I would probably sit at the sushi bar and order nigiri and the more basic rolls after explaining to the sushi chef that I prefer big cuts of fish on my nigiri. Billy went over and above to show that my first experience was not the norm and I appreciate the pride he showed in his restaurant. I would come back for lunch and for a staff that takes pleasing the customer seriously."}
{"text":"I love sushi and I eat it all over the world whenever on vacation.  Fresh Wasabi specialty rolls are seriously my favorite anywhere.  The staff are awesome as well.  They treat you like a good friend.  If this place ever goes out of business I will cry."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I have eaten in countless sushi bars/restaurants. This was by far the worst experience I've had. The waitress was just plain rude but that is besides the point. I ordered white fish sushi, salmon sushi and a spicy tuna roll. The fish used was OLD! The salmon was dry and rubbery and the white fish was a.) falling apart, b.) discolored and c.) the one side of it was so dried out that it was actually opaque and hard! I couldn't believe that someone would serve me that quality of food. It was also prepared sloppily. The roll seemed ok but I had already lost my faith in this place so I didn't risk eating more than a bite. To top it all off though, the chef tried to tell me that the salmon was SUPPOSED TO BE DRY and the white fish was SUPPOSED to be like that and that maybe they had different fish than the other places I've been. Different fish?! Really? It's not like having a different kind of bread than another place! It's fish! It's a freaking animal! Sushi is supposed to be tender and fresh, not dry and chewy (well, salmon tuna and whitefish anyway...) With standards like that I wouldn't even think of eating anything there... Raw or not."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!!  Love the place, the food!

It is family run and the staff is all very nice!"}
{"text":"Well it was not good. My husband and I have been in the past a few times and we enjoyed it. We recently moved back to Surprise so we went back to have dinner. We got here early, 5:30, and there was no on in there. Not totally odd for being that early. But during our experience, not one other person came in. Makes me suspicious. I then went to the bathroom and they are clearly doing the best they can to hide the god awful sewage smell in the bathroom, but it's not working. Smelled AWFUL. Our waitress hobbled over to us unenthusiastically. We put in our order. She brought the tuna sashimi and the cucumber salad and then forgot about our Miso soups. Let me remind you, there is not another soul in the restaurant, and you forgot?! Anyway, the cucumber salad was eh, but the miso was really good. While we are eating our sushi, which was mediocre at best, our hobble waitress sits down at the sushi bar and begins to UNWRAP THE DRESSING she had wrapped around her foot. GROSS! And shortly after that, I watch the sushi guy sit down right where the sushi is made and EAT HIS DINNER, right on the sushi line. The whole experience made me sick to my stomach and WE WILL NOT BE BACK."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is awesome too!! We had the Climax roll and a Booty Booty roll. They recommended a spicy roll which had a jalapeño in it. It was great."}
{"text":"Called to place a carry out order and they said they couldn't take our order because they had \"a full house\" and promptly hung up before we could ask anything else.

Horrible customer service! Definitely won't be back here and won't be recommending them either."}

{"text":"I live in north central Phoenix, and one night after payday had a hankering to go buy me some makeup. So I headed up to the closest Ulta, and was going to initially stop by L&L to buy me and the hubs some Hawaiian bbq for dinner.

Except Fresh Wasabi caught my eye. Now keep in mind the sign's a bit misleading- the first thing that catches your eye says 'bento box.' Not Fresh Wasabi. But you know, I'm always down for Japanese food. The place had a decent amount of people in it, and perusing the menu I saw two things that immediately caught my eye- ramen and bulgogi. I love the former, my husband the latter. So why not? I order me some ramen, get him the bulgogi bowl, and get us a cali roll to enjoy as well. 

The food came out promptly. That was... really about the only good thing here on out. 

My biggest beef (no pun intended) was how they packaged my ramen. They kept the broth and the noodles in two separate Styrofoam bowls. Pretty standard procedure. But they they proceed to stack my noodles and broth, my husband's bulgogi bowl AND the cali roll one on top of the other in some precarious leaning tower of take out asian food. It was a disaster waiting to happen. But I totter out with this tower of food tied up in a plastic bag, and proceed to drive the 5 or so miles home as carefully as I could. 

No luck. The thing topples over at the first light I gently pull to a stop at, and by the time I get home and bring the plastic bag in I realize that my broth is no longer in my styrofoam bowl, but all over the bottom of the plastic bag. 

Thank god for good plastic bags. At least they invested in those, because the lids on the soup bowl sure weren't up to par. The weight of everything else on top of the broth bowl broke the lid, and the braking did the rest. Soup got into our cali rolls, but NOT my noodles. My husband's bulgogi bowl escaped largely unscathed, but that didn't save it. It was bland and not very much like bulgogi. The cali roll was also, even without being soggy, mediocre and bland. And the mayo in the krab-mayo mix was yellow. Why, oh why? 

Now I'll take credit where credit's due. I SHOULD have asked to repackage the stuff. But even without the soup disaster, which I did try to put aside, the food was bland, mediocre, and not very authentic. 

All in all, a disaster. Maybe you'll have better luck eating in, but if the food was anything like what I took home that day just pass and go to L&L or Panda instead. You'll enjoy that more."}
{"text":"The food was good (seaweed salad, baked scallop roll), but the service was terrible. I went with 2 coworkers for lunch (noon) on a Thursday afternoon, expecting to be able to fit it into our lunch hour. Wrong! The waiter was not prompt about taking our orders, so that was the first delay. Also, each person's food was brought out at different times, so by the time I got my roll, one coworker was already done eating his miso, salad, and whole plate of sushi (at least 10 pieces), and the other was well more than halfway through his 2 rolls. For the money, I'd rather go to Hayashi across the street."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Fresh Wasabi since management changed a few months ago, and it did not disappoint!!! 
Since it was happy hour (3 - close), I only ordered off that menu. They have quite a few items, and the prices are very reasonable. 
I must say that hands down, this was the freshest sushi I have ever had!! And that includes in  Maui, San Francisco and the Florida Keys!! Everything I ordered was just as fresh, practically melts in your mouth. The hot Saki was just like it's supposed to be - VERY hot!! They even put a special wrap around the top so you don't burn your fingers while pouring!
On another positive note, the service was impeccable! Kevin was behind the sushi bar, and was very accommodating to whatever I ordered. Suni (pronounced soon-eee), was just as pleasant as the waitress. Always smiling and making sure everything was going smoothly. 
It most certainly won't be long until I return!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Service can be a little hit or miss though."}
{"text":"Good food, huge menu, fresh & tasty sushi.

People are friendly but never talk, very quite place."}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying, Every single sushi restaurant I have been to in Phoenix SUCKS! The rice doesnt stick, the rolls fall apart and they are BLAND!
My Suggestion: Cherry Blossom Roll & Sweet Thang!

Our waitress was VERY helpful! She told us her favorites and any house specials immediatly! We ordered and watched our rolls being made on the T.V. behind the chef's. My daughter got a kick out of that!! 

It is a small establishment but it does allow the owner to be more in tuned with the customers. He walks arounds, greets all customers and even takes orders if the place is busy. He learned it was our first time and made sure we were pleased with EVERYTHING! We also got to try the Fried Cheesecake with Chocolate Sauce...talk about Super YUMMY!

Amazing food! 
Amazing Service! 
Inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Sushi in Surprise!! I can not tell you how excited I am about this. Since my wife and the people I am around the most do not like sushi it makes it hard to persuade anyone to drive a distance for food they don't want. Now that I have one in my backyard I can make solo trips much more easily.

So first impression of this place was that it was your typical hole in the wall sushi joint.; nothing too fancy. We took a seat at the sushi bar and took a peak at the menu. It was huge! Tons of special rolls and combo platters. They we noticed their lunch specials, one for bento boxes and one for sushi rolls. I went with the 3 sushi rolls for $11.95 and added a bowl of miso soup for $1. The wife went with the teriyaki chicken bento box for $6.95. 

Everything was damn tasty and out the door we left for $30 after tip. I will definitely be coming back again and again; like I said, the menu is huge!"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the bad reviews.  I'm pretty tough to please and this place has beyond pleased me.  I don't know how accurate the previous reviews are.  They are pretty old so I'm not sure how much merit they hold OR the restaurant owners just decided to revamp the place since these reviews.  

My husband and I just had dinner there last night and we were 100% pleased and satisfied with the food, services, ambiance and prices.  We got so much food for such reasonable prices.  

I LOVE Squid Ink which is across the street but they have less selection and most of all their prices are too high for what you get.  We didn't order any dinners or cooked items, we ordered strictly sushi and it was fresh as can be.  For the price the fish was Delicious and abundant.  

I hope they don't shut down.  I have never been there because of these bad reviews but I completely regret my decision because I've just realized what I've been missing out on.  I completely recommend this place over Squid Ink if not equally.  Best Sushi in the 30 miles radius."}
{"text":"The service was very good, but the sushi not so much. There is too much filler in the fried rice, and where is the \"dragon\" in my dragon roll?? Like I said service was good, but the sushi quality- not so much."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. we purchased a coupon deal on Yelp and a sign on their door and inside states that they no longer accept them. No explanation.  Why not!!!! The lady didn't even seem to care."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite sushi restaurant in the Phoenix area and I've been to plenty. Delicious sushi and appetizers. I live for the First Love roll. Great prices and excellent staff. They are always welcoming. We have become regulars because of the exceptional food and service."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here and haven't been back since the new owners took over. Decided to give it a try and was so disappointed. The sushi is the same price but the quality is mediocre and the portions are smaller. I gave a three because the service was good and my daughters ramen was tasty but if I want sushi like that I'd rather go to Safeway. Sad, it was one of my favorite places to go, I don't think I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for lunch and the food was ok. Definitely not the best sushi I've ever had. The menu is pretty much just like any other sushi place. Nothing special. The staff was very friendly and provided me with great service. I will probably go back because there is not many sushi places in surprise."}
{"text":"I came here once at least a year ago with my parents and we honestly weren't terribly impressed. I found some of the sushi to be all right - the eel was rather good - but the rolls were small and the sashimi was unimpressive. Being a big sushi fan, I thought it was pretty good for the desert - hey, I'm biased, I live in California - and brushed off the high prices and mediocre quality as a result of the lack of competition in the area.

Fast-forward to today: obviously I'd forgotten about the place and bought the Yelp deal thinking my dad and I were going to check it out for the first time for lunch. Wrong; we pulled up to the restaurant and my dad reminded me that this was the sole sushi place we'd been to in town. No worries, we decided, we'll eat there for lunch anyways since the lunch bowls looked really good and the Yelp deal was enticing.

We were invited to seat ourselves. When the server brought us the menus, I informed her that I had a Yelp deal. She promptly removed the lunch menus from the table and told me that lunch specials weren't eligible with coupons. All right, I said politely, and my father and I proceeded to look at the menu. \"You sure you don't want to leave?\" my dad asked. I said no and decided that I'd just discuss the fact that the Yelp deal doesn't mention any restrictions thus she should honor the deal. In fact, the voucher specifically states, \"Deal must be honored according to terms on voucher. No additional restrictions may be added at time of redemption.\"

Well, the server came back to the table to take our order and I immediately mentioned that the Yelp deal does not mention any restrictions. She reiterated that they don't allow ordering lunch specials with a coupon. At this point it became an argument; I again tried to tell her that the Yelp deal doesn't list restrictions and that she is supposed to honor the deal as provided. She didn't let me finish my sentence and hurried back to grab the lunch menus, hastily and rudely shoving the lunch menus back onto the table and walking away. 

My dad and I looked at each other in disbelief. He suggested we leave and eat lunch at Macayo's, the popular local chain of Mexican restaurants. Done deal, I said, and we walked out.

Hopefully I'll be able to get my Yelp deal refunded. There is no way I am ever going back. It was mediocre sushi in the first place; if it makes me a snobby Californian for bashing the place then so be it, because all of these reviews of \"great sushi\" are total B.S. and I'm guessing a lot the reviewers haven't eaten the good stuff (I myself had never had truly decent sushi until I moved to California). Besides, it wasn't even the quality that drove me away, it was the horrendous attitude this woman gave us. A place like this doesn't deserve to be in business."}
{"text":"This place  is OFF my list. My husband and I went on a Friday night for dinner. The place was very busy. We were seated and waited at least 10 minutes for the waitress. We ordered and waited patiently. Everyone around us was getting their food more than 25 minutes later...we were still waiting. Finally someone came by and asked us if we had ordered. Give me a break!  I saw her go to the chefs who seemed to have misplaced our order sheet and were going to START  making it. At this point  we just left. The service is beyond deplorable.I suggest you look elsewhere for sushi."}
{"text":"This place has nice sized rolls. They were not to small but still one bite. My husband and I shared 7 rolls and were very full with about 10 pieces left over for snack later. The service was very attentive and the waitress took the time to explain some of the rolls and gave suggestions based on the flavors we liked. While the restaurant was very small, it was clean and well kept. We will be going back especially for the Geisha roll, Rock and Roll deep fried roll, and the Climax roll."}
{"text":"I've been to this location for a quick lunch, as a family, and on a date, and was never disappointed.  The rolls are great, though the quality of the fish is not quite as good as at Sakana, and their prices are a little high for the level of quality, but not by a lot.  Overall, it's still one of the more solid sushi places in the area, especially if you're way out in Surprise.  

A good example of what I mean with the disparity between quality and price is the poke bowl.  I have a kid that loves poke and ate 2 whole bowls at Yard House, but spit it out at Fresh Wasabi because the fish tasted funny...and here, they charge twice what Yard House charges.

So yeah, it's pretty good, but not the greatest, and for what I'm paying here, I would expect it to be a bit better, which is why I don't visit as often, now that I've tried out a couple of the better places in the area."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in the area, and that is saying something considering how much of these places exist. Their weekday lunch special bento boxes (a lot of food) are a great value and service is always fast. They have a large selection of specialty rolls that are amazing, as well as great combo dinner plates. This place has left me satisfied every time I have visited, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The place is a little over priced. But it was a very small and quite place to enjoy some delish sushi. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very unhappy.... I have been gone several years.   I used to be a regular.  

NOW... an auto 18% is charged for gratuity.

I am mot happy.

I am known to tip well.   But to have it taken out of my hands......  I do not go to place that do this.    The tip is for service.   I have tipped separately the cook and waiter."}
{"text":"The rolls here were so delicious, and fresh! We got the edamame and golden california roll on happy hour menu. We also tried the Cremosa salmon, and popcorn shrimp roll. They were SO good! I didnt get a picture of the popcorn shrimp because I ate it SO fast but it was topped with a popccorn shrimp, siracha, and a jalapeno slice and I didnt know I was missing that combo in my life until now! We will definitely be back! Very good prices!"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls had good flavor, but were very small and still expensive. Not to mention, the service was terrible. Not worth the trip. Too many other great sushi options around the NW Valley. Squid Ink, across the street, is great and really fun! Sakana on 59th is an excellent choice as well, just a further drive. Would not eat at Fresh Wasabi again. :("}
{"text":"The rolls are on the small side. We ordered the red dragon roll and the maki combo with green tea. The green tea was very good. The salad was nice and cold and the soup was hot and filled with tofu. The salmon and tuna was very good, everything else was ok. There was hardly any sauce on the red dragon roll. The rice also seemed extra sticky. Service was great and extremely fast."}
{"text":"This place is great. We were worried that the would be no good sushi when we moved here from Chicago. We should not have been. Fresh Wasabi in Surprise has awesome food and excellent service. They were great with my four year old and my one year old. There are almost too many choices on the menu, and every one we have tried has been a delight. I highly recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I love coming to this place! We most indulge in sushi for lunch. They have excellent salads, sushi, salmon, YUM! Great service!"}
{"text":"I received a restaurant.com gift certificate for Fresh Wasabi for Christmas and finally decided to use it tonight. Yes I know Christmas was 5 months ago.

We brought another couple with us and I told them we needed to spend $100 to get the $50 per what the certificate had said. Other than that no restrictions. So we ordered ALOT of sushi rolls, edamame, gyoza and teriyaki chicken.

 The food was really good. We stuffed out faces and then we got our bill. We gave our waitress the certificate and debit cards. She then tells us that we cannot use that gift certificate even though there is NO expiration date and states the restaurant is responsible for the discount. We then try to use our Yelp check-in for the free appetizer. She tells us that's not for their location even when we show her where the address is on the deal.

After all said and done we payed our full bill and left. We never would have ordered so much food if we knew they were going to refuse the gift certificate. The customer service was awful and unfortunately that is swaying my opinion of them. I will more than likely never go back because I'm pretty angry over my experience."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town, Western Washington State, so we pretty much know Fresh Good Sashimi and Sushi. I can't give FWS five stars but a strong 3+ stars. The waitress was less than stellar until we paid our $150 plus tip bill. All smiles then. However the #3 special for 4, a baked lobster roll, a tuna roll and 2 extra large Asahi and 3 regular Asahi beers; we'd give a 3+ rating. All the sashimi were pretty fresh but the tuna felt like it may have been previously partially frozen, good but less flavorful. The sushi chef made huge fish slices and served with a pretty nice presentation. All in all my friends from Sun City West would go back on their own again and I would too."}
{"text":"Food is good and service has been ok. A little on the expensive side. But if you really want sushi, etc. Fresh Wasabi is better than Hayashi, Ah-So, and Ichi Ban."}
{"text":"New Ownership, didn't like it before but it's totally different. Rolls are good, good variety and the happy hour rolls are good. I didn't expect much from a happy hour roll, but it was the best cost effective roll I've had. Thank you Kevin for turning around the place. I can actually stay in Surprise to have Sushi. Keep up the good work and hopefully others will give this place a chance and see the difference. 
I just updated to 5 stars because it's simply the best place my wife and I have had in AZ."}
{"text":"I was in Surprise, AZ for business and felt like having sushi for dinner. This place is close to a walmart I was at so decided to eat here. The place is nice and clean and I was seated immediately. I ordered the sushi combo with spicy tuna roll and it was fantastic. The fish was fresh, rice tasted great and the plate was expertly put together. If you are in Surprise and like sushi, try it out, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Pretty good the service is hit or miss most of the time its a miss! The food is usually pretty good but have had issues with portions and the way it prepared. My wife loves scallops and once we ordered the hibachi plate with scallops and they looked really good when the waitress brought out the dish. Once she left my wife flipped over the scallops and ALL of them were burnt! Now in fairness they refired the scallops and they were very good but its like you just never know when the service is going to suck!

Give the place a try and see for yourself. The sushi plates are very good. Sadly this place would not make it in a large major city as they just dont have the consistency to keep the standards level."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE! 
I got a Togo order and they were close to closing time (I felt so bad) but they were still extremely nice to me! I got the Vegetable Udon and it's super yummy and a huge portion + the little mermaid roll also yummy! 

My boyfriend is not one to try new places but even before trying the food he was like we have to come back and dine in (I was so shocked) we will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"This is based on the ramen. It was very bland and literally tasted like noodles and water. I highly recommend not trying this. The waitress did tell me these were popular dishes, although being from So Cal with some bomb ramen places, this places completely disappoints. I may never eat here again based on this ramen."}
{"text":"You know it was good food when you arrive home after 65 miles,  still savoring the meal.  I went to Fresh Wasabi intending to treat myself to Japanese food, since I had a meeting out in Surprise.  I chatted with the owner, found out they are Korean/Korean-,American and immediately started whining about the lack of good Korean food in Phoenix (he agreed, he's from LA, I think).  **BUT** he and his wife have a few Korean dishes on the menu, so I had the Kalbi Bi Bim Bap, which comes sizzling in a stone bowl -  fresh veggies cooked just right, kalbi beef over rice fragrant sesame oil, topped off with an egg and Korean hot sauce. Heaven.  

Please go taste this - maybe they can be convinced to expand their Korean menu (and maybe serve spicier hot sauce).  I'd drive out there again for this."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while we were in the area and thought we'd give it a try.  Great sushi!!  The sushi is on the smaller end but I would imagine that would me more authentic than the big lumps you get at other sushi places.  We ordered the \"same number of rolls\" as we do at other places but left there still hungry and wanting more ... I guess that is good or bad depending on how you look at it!"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to rate this an o.k. option for sushi.

The fish is as fresh as you can get. Menu options are pretty standard & I have yet to get sick or find poor quality ingredients.  I have been to this restaraunt more than once, my best visit was when they first opened.

Each encounter with staff has been positive, then again I don't ask for much but to be served what I ordered in a timely fashion.

Their Miso Soup is tasty; not too salty and they tend to serve larger portions of seaweed in the soup, which I prefer.

On this last visit I came in about a half hour to close and they were very polite, not trying to rush me at all."}
{"text":"Regular sushi eaters, we went on a Tuesday night.  Had 3 normal rolls and 3 special rolls.  Very, very good.  Very fresh, really enjoyed the way the rolls were cut just a bit smaller than normal, for easier eating.  Spicy could have been a bit spicer on the Tuna.  No ambiance, and the bathroom needs a major remodel.  Food rocked, service in definite need improvement.  Sushi chef was awesome.  Go for the food."}
{"text":"I like eating here they have some good happy hour deals.  I think the atmosphere needs some sprucing up but they have already added some cool stuff like the \"sushi cams,\" where you can watch the guys make rolls.  I would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years, it's our favorite sushi spot. Their fish is always fresh, and great service! We love their list of specialty rolls, lots to choose from! Although some rolls can be pricey, it is always worth it for good fish in your rolls. Their Hawaiian white tuna is one of my favorites (sashimi) and I love their Snow White roll with it too. My go to is always spicy Tuna! This is a great restaurant! Definitely try it out! They have great lunch specials and happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. The food is excellent and fresh.  My kids and and I love the sushi that we ordered so we order several other kinds and those too were phenomenal."}
{"text":"I decided to go with a friend to sushi a few days ago and wanted to find someplace in between our pads, and good ol' Yelp picked this place!

We went on a Tuesday night around 6:15 pm.  This place is kinda hidden in the back of a shopping plaza.  Upon walking in the first thing I noticed was the decor (or lack there of for a sushi restaurant) and the bright green wall in the back.  ODD.

There was only one or two other couples in the establishment...hmmm...

My friend and I sat right at the bar.  Only one rack had fish in it...seemed like one main chef working and two other waitresses.  Hmm again...

Was a little skeptical.

We decided to get an order of saki bombers...asked for ONE large set up for us both to split...someone we ended up getting TWO large sets, one for each of us...YIKES!  We decided to just try and swing it on our own and see how much we could finish.

Upon opening the menu I was greeted with a wide variety of rolls to choose from.  All seemed typical, some not so typical, but either way there was a lot to pick from.  It took us a while to decide what we wanted, and for the life of me I can't remember what specific ones we ordered (damn saki), so I can't be of much recommendation there.

I will say that what we did receive tasted delicious and fresh.  The rolls were reasonably priced and much lower for their specialty rolls than other establishments I have been to...that I like A LOT.

The sashimi was a little weird.  I always order yellowtail sashimi at any sushi place I eat, and this one seemed to cut the meat weird.  The slices were thin and rolled up in a little tootsie roll style.  Hmmm...

Extra bonuses:  The chef provided us with several samples of meats for free!  I always inquire about the specialty fish (toro, yellowtail belly, etc.) and they didn't have any.  He made us something unique: white tuna on top of rice with crispy fried onion strings on top.  What a delight!!!  I told them that this needed to be on the menu as a regular item to order!

In either case, the sushi was delicious and reasonably priced for the most part.  I would go back if I was in the area, but would not make the trek out there on an ordinary day.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The ownership has recently changed and this is one of the best Sushi bars in Surprise, Arizona. I have been there several times and look forward to returning next season. I would recommend this location to anyone wanting great Sushi with a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"As we enter the dimly lit sushi restaurant a small group of well dressed Asian men sit in a booth having a conversation but not eating and watch us carefully.  The ambiance is a little offsetting for two women and my daughter felt like we were about to disappear and our pictures may end up on the back of a milk carton.  We brave on and sit while the one server,  an older women attends to our needs.  The positives were the Lemon roll was delicious and the salmon was very great tasting. The tea smelled like fish and the whitefish was extremely fishy,  not in a good way.  The service was good, not the friendliest but quick and the food was average."}
{"text":"Everything was DELICIOUS! I had the Cherry Blossom roll and cucumber salad (pictured). The sushi was fresh and tasted great and the salad was great! My husband had the Poke Salad (something that's been seemingly difficult to come across) and he loved it! The staff were very friendly and made the whole experience worth a repeat."}
{"text":"Sushi is wonderful, nice place to go to lunch if your not in a hurry.  Customer service could be a little better however I feel like they are understaffed.  Love the fact that you can call in a to go order!"}
{"text":"My wife brought me here years ago and it was amazing. Then the ownership changed, the food wasn't as good, and yhe customers stopped going. At some point the current owners took over and the level of service and food is right back to where it was. I think the atmosphere would be a lot more enjoyable with more customers but that's on us. Maybe you'll see us there, so check it out and don't be shy!"}
{"text":"I met up the other day with my two good buddies for lunch, and thanks to yelp we all really enjoyed our visit to Fresh Wasabi.
I should probably offer a disclaimer that I'm not a huge sushi fan but I very much enjoy Japanese food otherwise.  We all ordered bento boxes, which were quite generous for the $8.95 price.  There was miso (good), tempura (good), salad (very good), california roll, rice and mine was chicken katsu which was quite good.  
Good food and friendly service make this a solid bet, especially in Surprise."}
{"text":"I love Fresh Wasabi!  If u love to eat rolls, they have SO many to choose from.  They have the largest variety by far, and they are really tasty too.  They get creative and just don't offer the \"usuals\".  They are fair with their pricing.  The only negative I have is that they don't sell liquor, however, they do have beer, saki and Japanese wine."}
{"text":"Prices are a little bit high on certain rolls. Too much rice in the teriyaki bowl and not enough vegetables.  But overall the sushi had me sold, all the sushi rolls I had were delicious!! I had the seven sensation roll, a spicy salmon roll, a spicy scallop roll and The rock shrimp roll. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Omg... where should I begin... first off, this place is a hot ass mess. I came to this place with my co-workers for lunch today and I ordered Zarusoba (Cold Buckwheat Noodles). We were waiting forever but we didn't even complain in person. After patiently waiting about 45 minutes, our food finally came. We were so shocked with what we saw. I only got 4 tiny lil' bites of noodles with dipping sauce and it was $12 plus tax. Sucking them down for 1 minute and all gone. Yes, this was for real, people. 1 bite is almost $3.25. What kind of BS is that... We even asked if this price is a joke or mistake but a server looked very confused but smiling then walked away. If you have a very expensive taste for your diet meal plan, I would recommend it highly otherwise you better order something else OR just go to Panda Express right next to this restaurant. I'm not trying to be mean but dear Fresh Wasabi, thank you for the instant laugh and keeping me hungry."}
{"text":"Since this last review my husband and I have been in quite a few more times and have spoken with the owners Kevin and Sunni multiple times. Both are wonderful people and are always aiming to please their customers. They never skimp on quality or quantity of food. This is by far our favorite sushi spot and do not like going any place new because most of the time they all have similar flavors and names. Kevin actually makes his own sauces and cares so much about his menu and what he is doing. Please give this place a try and if it isn't too busy ask the chef to make you something special or something you might like! We have and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food isn't the problem. Today, when I alerted the manager/owner (whatever he is) that he had gotten my $15 order wrong he screamed in my face. He accused me of having reported him to the BBB, I have only been there ONE TIME!!! He clearly does not know how to be around people, let alone run a business.

Long story short he threw my food away with no apology, and didn't refund my money. Which I WILL be getting back from my bank. I didn't go in aggravated (even though I had to drive the 15 min back to the restaurant to fix this order) I was nice about the entire thing. 

With him screaming in my face I felt very threatened, being on 5'3 and a girl. I would NOT recommend this place!!!!!!

There was one other person in there besides myself that was a customer. If that's a \"busy\" day it says something about your business. I was charged, the only reason why the charge has been taken off my account was because of my call to my bank. 

LISTEN EVERYONE: There's a Hybachi Japanese right down the street that doesn't cost nearly as much and provides you with better service and better food (as well as larger portions). It provides take out as well :). I would suggest you go there!

P.S. 
I don't normally go out of my way to create YELP accounts to bash business' that provided great service to me...."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to get Japanese in the west valley! I was starting to give up on them here in surprise a few years ago and then we found this place. Always good, thank you!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place where I thought about not writing a review, because I don't want to help it get too crowded.  

I have had sushi in a variety of locations in the U.S., and outside of the U.S.  I am a sushi fan.  

Fresh Wasabi Sushi and Grill doesn't have every sushi option in the book, but they have a very solid selection.  

For what they have, THIS PLACE HAS 5 STAR SUSHI.

The best part?  LOW PRICES!

You may find a sushi restaurant out in Scottsdale, with a better sushi selection and slightly better sushi quality.  But you will pay 2-3 times the price.

They do take out, provide outstanding service, the owner always goes out of his way to try and connect with all customers.  Impeccably clean.  Very happy with the seating layout, despite the smaller size.  Appropriate music played at an appropriate volume.  Kid friendly.  Great spot to take your family, or to have a date.  Probably want to keep a group at no more than 6 unless not a busy time."}
{"text":"Was in Sun City West and this was one of the most-reviewed places (almost 100) so I checked it out.

Hostess girl was nice but timid. Told her I would sit at the sushi bar, she got me a drink and was very courteous.

Sushi chef greeted me and asked if I had questions. I asked him to recommend maybe a sashimi and a specialty roll. He didn't seem too excited, so I asked what he was having for lunch :)

He then wrinkled his nose and said he doesn't eat here. So I laughed and asked what he WOULD order. He said he didn't like raw fish, only cooked fish. His name is An, and I asked him how he could be a sushi chef and hate sushi. Said he didn't hate it, just didn't like it.

So he asked me if I wanted something deep-fried and I said yes. He made it quickly and handed it to me.

I asked him for a few pieces of sashimi and after discussing choices with his co-worker, the co-worker in English asked if I wanted the 8 piece sampler. I said yes!

In between getting my items, the co-worker handed me a specialty roll with shrimp on the ends, and said that they had already made it, so it was on the house. It was tasty and was the perfect temperature.

The specialty roll and the deep-fried roll were both tasty. Sashimi had no sauce and I didn't finish one of the pieces because it wasn't good. Will not order sashimi here again, but I have had some awesome sashimi from Ra Sushi that had great sauces and texture.

Might come back to see the other sushi chef again :)"}
{"text":"The service was horrible. The TV was on a station showing a deer being hunted and killed. All in all a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars but the service wasn't great. The atmosphere was also lacking and it was odd that they weren't busier for it being 630. However, the sushi was fresh and tasty which is what really counts for me!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!!!! Our waitress did not seem interested in helping us and never brought over markers to order sushi of their menu. I had to borrow one from a table that was next to us. Once she finally came around to take our order, she seemed upset that we asked a question about the menu. As for the sushi, it was just \"okay\"but there was nothing special about it. I do not plan on going back there again due to their lack of customer service and their mediocre sushi."}
{"text":"We went there for our 50th anniversary dinner as we always have sushi for our anniversary.  There was only one person  at the sushi bar when we went in.  We placed our order and were served Albacore shashemi for the first course.  When it was served, the fish was very warm and should have been ice cold.  I was told that he seared the fish was why.  The next couple of orders were  also warm.  Very dangerous.  Will never eat there again.  Also there was only one other person  came in the whole time were there."}
{"text":"Not sure why only 3.5 stars, but this place is great.  Awesome service, friendly waitresses, great food, cheap prices and very clean.  Happy hour menu is 2:00pm to close and lots of choices.  For a small neighborhood sushi restaurant, this place is perfect. Give it s try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a coworker friend. She used to live in Japan for a while, so she's a little picky about sushi. She loved it. I did too. I really liked the miso soup and iced green tea. The server was very nice too. Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming, super service. We did carry out and it was outstanding. We will go back for happy hour. We had sushi combo that included soup and salad and it was fresh and tasty. We are from Chicago where sushi is common place and this stood up to metropolitan standard."}
{"text":"Not bad for a sushi joint in the desert! Have to admit we purposely go during the slow times ( happy hour ) and sit at the sushi bar. Service has been \"just ok\" but the sashimi & sushi are good and priced well from 2pm - 4pm definitely a value and so close in Surprise."}
{"text":"Really good sushi and great service! Hayashi use to be our go to place But has changed owners and looks like they have gone down hill so we decided to try this restaurant for sushi and we were not disappointed. We are now regulars and the wife is a waitress. She is super sweet and is always recommending different sushi for us to try."}
{"text":"Great service and Sake/Beer special, but the sushi was just OK, and I'm not a sushi snob. probably won't go back =("}
{"text":"If you like sushi, go here.

Yup.  The big FIVE stars.  And they deserve every single star.

I have tried quite a few sushi places, comparing them to my \"home\" sushi restaurant, and every single time, that restaurant hadn't compared.... until we came here.

We were intending to go to Rubio's for a quick dinner after a party and then go hang out at home.  We have wanted to come here for weeks (since they opened this Surprise location) and they had always been closed, and when coming up on Rubio's tonight, they were still open, so we switched to sushi mode.

Walk in and you are visually greeted with a wide open room of maybe 10 tables and 3 booths on the side, and of course your sushi bar.

We asked to be seated at the bar.  We like to watch the sushi chef make their creations and check out the care of the fish.

I was originally turned off by how the chef left the doors to the cooler with the fish open.  It concerned me... it's Arizona... we are hot, and I do not want my sushi at room temperature since it's so easy to get sick from meats at that temperature.

We received the first of our standard first fare with a new sushi restaurant - salmon sashimi and yellowtail sashimi and I actually said, out loud, \"Wow.\"

Now, mind you, I am used to large portions of sashimi and used to fairly large steak slices of fish in my sashimi.

These were HUGE steaks of fish!!  We got like 6 steaks of salmon and 5 steaks of yellowtail and they were so thick and barely out of frozen (this explains why he left it open... he wanted them to thaw)... I bit into it and the yummy goodness of these fish was just perfect.  I was greatly happy and looked forward to getting our specialty rolls.

The first to come out, perfect timing after finishing our sashimi, was the Godzilla roll.  The roll was very nice looking, large pieces, and an even number of pieces. Took a bite...

Holy...

Crap.

These guys know taste!!  I might have to put these guys up on par with my home sushi restaurant!   

I don't know about  you, but the guilt of saying that someone else has the same amount of skill with the sushi knife and taste in comparison to the restaurant you have been so loyal to for 5 years... it's rough.

So I was thinking, \"Ok.  Let's try the next roll.  If they meet expectations then... I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.\"

....

Dammit, now here's the bridge.

We got the Arizona roll.  Very tasty... an excellent mix of sweet, spicy, and bold.  The sauces were incredible.  I purely expected a clash to occur considering the three sauces that were on top of this roll, but OH MY GOD.

I'm in trouble.

Next roll... the baked scallop roll. 

I LOVE scallops.  They are my favorite... raw, grilled, sauteed, or baked.

These were even better baked on top of a california roll with the unagi sauce.  Very good, not too much, but very sweet.

So, being the foodie I am, I'm discussing this quietly with my partner at the bar.

It's like the staff there psychically understood how we were rating them and they approach us and ask what we think.

I told them it's excellent and explained why.

The chef offered us some cold chopped oranges to cool the palate after our intense meal with our beer and sake.  A perfect topper!

I feel I can't even express how surprised I am that they were so excellent.  I purely expected these guys to be normal... like Takamatsu or Ah-So... and was blown away by their incredible \"taste\" abilities.

The people were very nice.  Take out is available.

We are going back.  We were watching the chef make other rolls... we have already decided what other rolls we are getting.

If you like sushi... go here."}
{"text":"Huh. I'm just as curious about this review as you are. I don't even know what we're going to say. 

But yeah. It was good. I mean nothing was wrong. I think I'm still just in this kinda Awe moment cos I expected the same WTF Fresh Wasabi on Bell. 

Only thing we seen was the waitress sneezed into her hand and then handled the customers menus. Can't say if she washed her hands or not before handling plates, but
My food was flavorful...maybe that's the secret seasoning: Cold Flu. 

Whatever, I ain't complaining. 

What compelled me to try everything especially after being severely disappoint in the Fresh Wasabi on Bell Road. 

But I'm happy I did. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"If you like sushi, go somewhere else. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of both the service and the food. 

I decided to take my family here because the other reviews seemed good; however, either my experience was an anomaly or the other Phoenix yelpers and I have stark differences in taste.

The staff had great smiles, yet lacked follow through. We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice. The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen! Although poor in quality, they were high in price for what they serve. I'm not sure about the names of some of their rolls...one was named \"Climax.\" Gross and just distasteful.  

The decor and ambiance leave you wanting. They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming. 

Even though this is the only sushi bar in Surprise, I will gladly drive to Peoria or Scottsdale the next time I have a craving for sushi."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. It isn't our favorite sushi spot in the West Valley, but it's close to our home (about a mile), so we like to walk up here when the weather is nice. Yes, some of the rolls are small. I actually like that, as I really watch my portion sizes, but I suppose if you want a big meal, you might have to take this into account and order more. The food is delicious, and we have no complaints there. Service is always good and they are fast. The owner (I assume he is the owner anyway) is really sweet. It's pretty quiet on the weeknights we come here, which is nice, but I wouldn't mind having it be busier because I'd hate to see this place go! I do see quite a bit of people get take out, however. 

Tip: Sometimes there is a coupon on the back of Fry's receipts!"}
{"text":"Fresh Wasabi is the best Japanese restaurant in Surprise for food quality and service.  We have been sushi regulars since they opened and have always enjoyed fresh fish and great rolls.   They are very consistent with providing high quality, fresh sashimi.  

We have also had the tempura, chicken teriyaki, yakisoba, and other dishes and have always enjoyed them.  The sake bombs are also quite nice and a good way to get the evening started.  

Service is usually pretty good and if there are any momentary lapses, they are quick to appologize and correct any issues.  We have brought our kids here and been perfectly comfortable.  Although they don't have a kids menu, the kids love to share certain rolls or share one of the Japanese dishes, expecially Tempura.  

The only thing keeping Fresh Wasabi from 5 stars is the ambiance. Although they seem to be making slow improvements since they opened, the dining room still does not have an inviting feel to it and there is still some evidence of the smoothy shop that formerly had that space.

Note:  they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"My husband and I had several of their happy hours sushi rolls, including Spider Roll (soft shell crab is quite good there), Philadelphia roll, tuna sushi, spicy crab roll, shrimp tempura roll...all for about $23.

Happy hour is a good deal & I recommend it!

Most days I've been there, it's been really good.  I went last week and it was average.  Today, it was good again.  Maybe the sushi chef had a bad day, or I don't usually get the sushi chef I had last week."}
{"text":"Had lunch solo and was greeted by the server.  Shrimp tempura was fresh and crispy, sauce was warm and tasty.  Ordered sushi rolls which were fabulous! I had the Avery island roll, salmon tempura, and Tuna and avocado roll.  Good size bites, perfect filling ratio to rice. Sushi chef was super friendly and the server filled my drinks without me asking or flagging her down. They have a good variety of sushi and specialty rolls. I'll definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Holy crap...but in the best way possible.  Thank you God for Fresh Wasabi.  After a 7 hour drive from SoCal I was exhausted.  Went to local Walmart for provisions and drove around parking lot looking for anything healthier than road food.  I have been around the sushi block, my husband says I'm lucky he can afford me and my sushi habit.
This is the shizzle!!  Sushi places can be blah, institutionalized to try to appeal to masses.  This is completely authentic.  One of the dishes I ordered was Screaming O.  Um, OH!!  After trying it, I know why its called that.  Make sure you order one of these per person bc you don't want to share in someone else's Screaming O!!
Who knew Arizona for Sushi.  Again, holy crap!!"}
{"text":"How on earth is this place getting all these great reviews? The only reason I went here was because the Yelpers were raving about it. 

Dined:  Saturday March 31, 2012 @ 6PM 
Party Size: 3 Adults, 2 Children (6 and 9)

Order: 
01 - Mix Tempura 
01 - Salmon Sushi 
01 - Clam Sushi 
01 - Beef Teriyaki 
02 - California Rolls 
02 - Las Vegas Rolls
01 - Veggie Roll  
01 - Some other roll I can't remember.

Tempura - Overpriced.  $10 for 10 pieces. 

Salmon Sushi - Mom and Dad said this was good. 

Clam Sushi - There was at least 1 grain of sand in this tough clam. Biting down on sand is a big bummer!

Beef Teriyaki - Tasteless. This was a HUGE LETDOWN. For $14 it seriously lacked flavor and was not $14 worth. This dish is should be priced at $9.00. 

California Rolls - Small, but true to form...they were California rolls. 

Las Vegas Roll - Made with eel, but very good. 

Veggie Roll - Like the California roll in size, small and ok as far as the quantity or filling. 

Mystery Roll (Some other roll I can't remember) - It was ok. 

*************

Atmosphere: A smaller sushi place, nothing fantastic, plain. 

Service:  When I ask the serve what that appetizing dish on the other table is, which this server just brought to them, saying I don't know is not what I want to hear.  Even after asking the people at the table... the answer was ___, ___ or __. Ugh.  
 They did not refill our glasses even once, it wasn't busy.  

*************

Will I return? No, this was a major bust. All of my family were expecting better.  My mom is going to hold this one over my head for a while."}
{"text":"Great selection of of food and a great selection of sushi with two sushi chefs. We alway eat here while we are on vacation. Service is great."}
{"text":"Great food & friendly staff. They were a little behind on making rolls due to the dinner rush & made a sweet gesture to bring us some edamame on the house to keep our bellies happy. Highly recommend the mermaid roll."}
{"text":"The sushi was tasty and the service was quick.  It's a small place and with just a little dining room, but it was comfortable and not too crowded.  Overall, it was a nice place for a casual dinner (and there are TVs with closed captioning for the sports nuts, but without the sports bar feel for the rest of us)."}
{"text":"Surprised at all bad reviews. Came here with the wife and our three kids. Had the Kiss My Bass, Sweet Thang, Rainbow, and Geisha. Kids split a California and an udon soup. Everything was great, and our waitress was awesome.

Only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that great sushi isn't really possible in the middle of the desert (without paying an arm and a leg)."}
{"text":"I usually love this place and was excited for their remodel; which looked great, BUT there's a waitress there that had a 'resting bitch face' the whole time she served us and after she took our order she sneezed into her hand! 

We got a few rolls that comes with 'eel sauce' but the rolls barely had any eel sauce on them."}
{"text":"Wonderful spicy sushi. Normally disappointed in spice. Hidden gem in Surprise, AZ. Authentic."}
{"text":"Can you say food poisoning? 

It was obvious as we walked in the door that this place was trying to cut down on expenses. They had turned off the air conditioning when it was 100 degrees outside and had large ceiling fans going on full blast. This was highly irritating as the fans not only dried out my food but did a number on my eyes also. The women waitresses were very kind and at times almost too eager to take our order as we were asked by three different people what we wanted. When we got our sushi for two it was WARM! I'm not talking about good old fried Las Vegas roll warm, I'm talking shashimi over rice. I've been to several countries and eaten plenty of raw things and assumed it would be ok since about 99% of the time my stomach can handle it. I was wrong. I wonder now if they had turned down the cooling case where the sushi is stored? I would bet if the health department did a random inspection they are not keeping it kept at the right temperature. 

To top off the lukewarm fish, the people at the table next to us got drunk and started yelling at the waitress about being overcharged. I really should give them more stars just for the entertainment value of watching them try to communicate to drunken hillbillies. 

Well the joke was on me because I soon realized what they were angry about. We came with a groupon and they applied the discount after tax. They don't print out an itemized bill they just give you the paper with the total so you don't really know what your bill was.... But I'm on to you Fresh Wasabi! I don't know on what planet they thought that was ok because I have never NEVER been to a place that does this. Our bill was only about $40 so a few dollars here or there was not a big deal to me but to the hillbillies who racked up a $180 bill it was a big deal. After many threats from the drunks to call the police they finally left and as our entertainment factor dwindled we vowed never to trek out to Surprise for irritable bowls ever again."}
{"text":"Is one star the lowest I can do. I don't care if food is good or bad the service is horrendous. These people need serious training in waiting on people. 

It just never got better. The owner defended the smallest rolls I have ever seen at a sushi joint. The waitress was just rude.

Watched 3 tables just walk out after waiting more than 15 minutes to get served. 

Rolls are small and expensive but good.

Seriously have no clue how this place is in business."}
{"text":"Good rolls. The waitress was great at suggesting some new rolls for us.  We have had a little bit of a wait when we try to come here at other times.  But overall this is a safe bet for some sushi!"}
{"text":"We've been to this place before and they always gave us the military discount.  This time we asked if they still did the military discount before we even sat down and the lady said yes, so we sat down and ordered.  after our meal she wanted to see my I.d. So I gave it to her and she stood there and stared at it for about a minute and then spoke up and said are you retired and I said yes, then she says alright I do it for you this time but we won't do it again, this made us feel like we were trying to get over on them or something and her persona about it was rude, so I said...So anyone who is retired from the military isn't worthy of a discount in your restaurant.. is that what you are saying, then she looked at me and said oh well let me check on this..she comes back a few minutes later and says..we do it this time..then I said you go ahead and charge me your regular price...10 percent on a19 dollar meal isn't a big deal and I don't want to break your restaurant...I told my wife this is the last time we come back here. I don't mind if a place doesn't give a military discount..it's no big deal...but don't tell someone you give it and then scrutinize there I.d. Like your looking at with a magnifying glass and then discriminate against you because your retired.  I never have had a place discriminate against me because I was retired...it's like saying now that your retired your not worthy anymore.  These people are idiots."}
{"text":"Im not a sushi person so maybe my review wont be useful. I went cuz the hubby wanted sushi. I figured a veggie roll and some teriyaki beef would be cool. The veggie roll wasnt bad, but it was actually just avocado. My teriyaki beef was terrible! It tasted and looked like it was boiled then spray painted grill marks. It was cold, chewy and hard to swallow. Very dissapointing!! I asked the hubby  how he felt about the sushi he ordered and he said it was ok, not 4 stars thats for sure. Im sure they are great, but not interested in a second visit."}
{"text":"I was so glad to see that a sushi place finally came to Surprise.  Food was pretty good and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Ate here several times in the past weeks. Great every time. The rolls were really, really good. Nigiri was fine with generous cuts of fish. Loved the sake-bombs. Large (22oz) Ichiban beer with hot sake for $5.95! Very sweet people run this place. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"We came in for the first time tonight and were really impressed with the food. We had the spicy tuna, Las Vegas, and crunch rolls and they were very good. I also had the tempura udon soup which was very good. Our service was great- drinks brought out quickly and on top of refills. Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Since it has been under new ownership, we have ordered from here twice for take out and both times we didn't get any wasabi and ginger. When I called to ask, the lady on the phone unapologetically said they should be in the box     Well they weren't. The food is not bad but service is not good."}
{"text":"Too bad.  What started out with a lot of promise has gone way downhill.  Within the last month, I've been to the 67th & Bell location and to Pleasant Valley.  There's just no comparison anymore.

Waitstaff is still very friendly, but the food quality is waaaay below 3 or 4 star.  Rice is gummy, some fish was actually warm and depending on who the sushi chef is, the rolls are not at all consistant.  Iris, you and your brother need to spend some time out here.....or you'll be out of this location."}
{"text":"Finally found one!  A great sushi bar.  I'd heard that Fresh Wasabi was good - but it's pretty far down Bell Rd.  Well, this one was very good, brand new and at the corner of Bell and Grand - right across the parking lot from Home Depot.

What a selection - lots of rolls if you're a roll person.  But lots of sashimi and plain sushi as well.  A full sheet of lunch specials including some tempura boats, etc.

And the fish was excellent!  Wonderful Yellowtail, as a matter of fact.  Happy to see them out here, and I think you will be, too."}
{"text":"If you didn't already realize it by now, I'm partial to this local neighborhood sushi restaurant, so quaint, you might almost miss it if you weren't stopping by to get Chipotle, Cold Stone, or Dunkin - your trademark names. 

Each time I come here, I feel like I'm returning \"home,\" since they warmly greet you as you enter the restaurant. There's alot more decor present, as well as more booths to accommodate sushi lovers since it first opened. 

My most recent find is their new specialty roll, The Fire Roll, which is uniquely prepared by being lit on fire within a foil as it sits on a sizzling fajita platter. My biggest worry was that it would cook the sushi inside. However, it did not! The inside is filled with crab, spicy tuna, tempura shrimp and this is all covered with avocado and shrimp. To top it off is some zesty spicy red sauce that is reminiscent of eating something smoked or barbecued. Combining a smoky flavor with sushi is uncommon yet ingenious! I may just love it even more than my past favorite, the cilantro inspired jalepeno Jose roll, which is also written on the wall among specialties.

I also always order the \"sweet shrimp\" amaebi nigiri. As I keep posting pics, the raw shrimp adorned with roe and chives gently cradle a martini glass with a festive cocktail umbrella. The fried shrimp heads are cooked to a crisp so it's similar to eating a soft shell crab, in other words - yes you eat everything! Yes, from the description, it's for more adventurous foodies, but it has earned its way into my heart as one of my favorite treats. It's not always prepared at all sushi restaurants. 

The art of sushi is definitely still alive here if you know what to order and are more daring. Their specialty rolls on the wall are far more impressive than their simpler traditional ones you'd recognize. Oh, and again, don't forget to ask for the fresh wasabi, the real deal, not some green play dough looking paste. I think it's a bit extra, but you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"Let me warn you, this review has some bias. Ever since I started working in Surprise, which was around 2009, I've been eating here for lunch probably once a week. As a result, being a regular, I've had great service most of the time...except on super busy days (in which case only one waitress can handle so many tables at a time). I don't usually have to order because she already knows what I want, which is typically the sushi bento box. It comes with a salad, miso soup, choice of 8 piece Cali or spicy tuna roll, edamame, salmon/shrimp/tuna/white fish nigiri, veggie tempura and of course rice. It's like a sampler of fun for my tummy if you ask me. I always love bento boxes. 

The seafood here has been consistently fresh all these years. The rolls aren't exactly break-thru, but they all taste really good.

If I'm not eating bentos, might I recommend the following:

Monkey Brain Appetizer - Spicy tuna stuffed mushrooms and deep fried and covered in a sweet sauce. This one is a no-brainer. (Pun intended) 

Climax Roll - shrimp tempura, cream cheese, covered with spicy tuna and sliced jalapeño, tobkio, spicy mayo and eel sauce and creamy wasabi sauce

Second climax - same as above BUT spicy tuna covered in yellow tail (instead of shrimp and cream cheese inside)

Guilty pleasure - same as above BUT spicy tuna covered in Hawaiian white tuna 

Playboy Roll - shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado all inside and tuna, Panko crunchy flakes, eel sauce, tobiko, wasabi mayo outside

First Love Roll - Spicy crab with tuna inside. Fresh salmon and lemon slices outside with a sauce on top. 

Dynamite Roll - Baked goodness. Crab mix, scallops, shrimp, mushrooms all on top of a California roll baked with a sauce on top (every sushi restaurant seems to have this on their menu but each have their own variation. Here, it appears to be the added mushrooms)."}
{"text":"Pretty regular spot for date night or  just grabbing a quick dinner.  Still haven't had anything I didn't like and the sushi is always fresh. Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Great food. Service ok.
But I just tried eating here. Showed up at 8:15 completely unaware that they closed at 8:30.
5 secs through the door, and the waiter lady gasped and says \"you didn't see the sign, we're gonna close\" rolled her eyes, and walked off completely overwhelmed...I would've gladly left understanding her situation, but she completely rubbed us wrong, went about it horribly, and we were out the door before she could return to serve her annoying customers...
Not a good experience whatsoever."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed.  I am very familiar with japanese cuisine, and I went to this location because I liked the location in Surprise (there arent any japanese choices in Surprise and Hayashi sucks bad!) 

Anyways, the sushi I ordered was pretty bland, the fried rice i ordered was small.. I went in for lunch by myself and for 2 rolls of sushi and fried rice and a drink my total was $30 !!!  

I honestly have never felt so ripped off eating somewhere.  

Sakana has these guys beat, the lunch special sushi from them so much food that you wont finish it.  I have gone there with 2 people and both ordered the special, 2 drinks and fried rice and the total is under $29."}
{"text":"Amazing! Super quick service, and super amazing food. Would definitely recommend to anyone craving good sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi was great! Nice selection, really nice atmosphere and very polite customer service."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, however the service left much to be desired. Waited about 45 min before we had food on the table, and even then one meal was completely forgot. There is another sushi place nearby that I'll try instead."}
{"text":"The fish was fresh and the special rolls creatively made. Prices were reasonable especially the all day $5 Sake bombs."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and thought I would try this place out instead of my usual Japanese express place I love so dearly. Once I walked in I thought wow this place was nice.... well that did not last long they took forever to ask for my to go order oh and they are so over priced  . It was not as good and I spent more for it. I was waiting for my to go order and a women walked in and sat down was was served all her food before mine which was not fair I had been waiting for a good 10 min before she even walked through the door. Not only that but I was charged more for a to go order because they include gratuity which is ok but they also ask for a tip too. All in all I find this place money hungry with poor customer service and mediocre food. I will not be going back to even give them another try."}
{"text":"I'm glad I gave this place a second chance... My first experience several months ago was very average... Decided to give it another chance last night... Very impressed. Loved the 'Second Climax Roll' -  Will be back for more..."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Fresh Wasabi 4x now. I have to say that their rolls are very good, great quality. So if you're looking for sushi and/or rolls - it's great!  Also great is the hamachi kama appetizer - love it and get it every time. If you're looking for good teriyaki bento boxes - imo this is not the place. Also the crab puffs are clearly store bought and not in a good way. So, stick to their specialties and it's a go for Fresh Wasabi!"}
{"text":"Was very impressed! The outside does not look like much but the inside was very clean and cute. I had a couple different Rolls and both were super fresh and tasty. My fiancé does not eat sushi and had a beef teriyaki and again was surprised was great. If looking for a great sushi place in surprise this place is great."}
{"text":"Friday night my wife and I found ourselves wondering what we would like to have when I suggested trying Fresh Wasabi.  

I had been here once before and I had the teriyaki chicken dinner and a caterpillar roll.  I wasn't impressed with the caterpillar roll at the time because the Eal tasted a little fishy.  since they had just opened I figured I would come back another day to make a comprehensive review of things. 

Wednesday night my wife and I ordered an array of items.  We got a tootsie roll, surprise roll, masago, sunshine roll, oysters, shrimp tempura roll and a couple others. 

The surprise roll was amazing, mouthwatering and full of flavor.  It was my favorite out off all the rolls.  The tootsie roll If I remember correctly had Eal layered on top and again the Eal tasted fishy.  As my wife and I were talking about it we came to the conclusion that maybe it just isn't cooked as well done as it is at other sushi bars.  Usually you will see the sushi chef put Eal on a piece of aluminum foil and pop it in a toaster oven before applying it to a roll but I don't think they do that here.

The Sunshine roll was a pleasant surprise.  Some one sitting at a table had ordered it not realizing it came with Masago on top and they sent it back and the waitress asked if we would like to have it so it didn't go to waist.  I was more than willing to accept.  The fish was fresh, cold and flavorful.  The thin slices of lemon on top made for a sweet and tart flavor.  Mmmmmm!

Lastly I ordered there oysters that were on special since everyone at the bar was also ordering them and I didn't want to miss out on this tasty adventure.  They were prepared with a little fish sauce, masago, and hot sauce.  Wow they were tasty.

The shrimp tempura was also very good.  This is what I call my old stand by.  I love shrimp tempura so having it in a sushi roll is delectable.  

Every one at the sushi bar was a lot of fun, we all talked and shared laughs together.  The sushi chef was preparing excellent sushi, and the wait staff was very friendly and kept up with our drinks and were very tentative.  We will be back.  My only recommendation is that they maybe cooked the Eal a little longer or find another vendor for it because it is not mouth watering by any means.  So if you live in Surprise or are in the area go by and check out Fresh Wasabi, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The new ownership has really made great improvements. Everything is very high quality and for what you get, the prices are very good. The happy hour and lunch specials are really good deals. All of the people who work here are very friendly. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have to say I was impressed.  I am not a fan of the big, over the top trendy sushi bars.  This place was just right.  The service was great.  I love when a service person takes the time to talk with you and give you as much information as you need.  The sushi chefs were authentic and actually care about what they make.  Now on to the food....  awesome!  There are way too many sushi places that pack a little fish into a one inch wrapping of rice.  This place was just the opposite.  An emphasis on taste, appearance and quality sets this place apart from the rest.  The sashimi was incredible.  It was very moist and dissolves in your mouth just like good raw sushi should.  And they of course offer \"fresh wasabi\".  Normally I am used to the standard green blob that everyone serves.  But for $1 you can get a great departure from the norm.  Just a little dab of fresh wasabi on some tuna sashimi and you will know a difference.

I can definitely say that I have found a new sushi spot.  Others very close by have tried and failed due to an attempt to be a \"Scottsdale\" sushi bar.  This is a much more authentic sushi place with a great simple decor and true service.  You will find it hard to be disappointed."}
{"text":"A local spot recommended by a friend. Sushi was great. I'm a fan of \"The Little Mermaid\" sushi dish. My husband likes this place and the coupon for buy $15 to spend $25 helped alot. It was almost like getting a free dish. Chicken fried rice is horrible and I wouldn't order anything else besides Sushi here."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything is delicious! I love the eel and booty booty rolls! The husband loves the caterpillar roll. I usually come in for a light lunch when I'm through hiking. I always bring in my friends... sushi nubs or sushi haters just so I can get them to change or makeup their minds. LoL. Service is great and there is always seating."}
{"text":"I like to call and order a cali roll to go when I am busy running errands and shopping, it is inexpensive, they make a cool cali roll, and they are nice and fast."}
{"text":"Good selection of apps, salads, ramen and udon, sushi and sashimi at reasonable prices. No frills and average to above average flavors freshly made.

Had the veggie tempura (6 pieces mixed of onion, zucchini, sweet potato, and asparagus) with a sweet sesame sauce, small salad (chopped lettuce, red cabbage, carrot with simple soy and sesame dressing), and bowl of miso (very nice). Tempura and miso were very good, while the salad was just so-so. Not bad for $8.50. Wife enjoyed her California and Baked Lobster rolls.

Nice to have a quick and easy Japanese place in the area."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional tonight despite the fact one of the sous chef's did not show up for work...
To ease the pain of having to wait a few extra minutes we were served an order of Edamame.
CA Roll and Fried Rice were phenomenal.
Will definitely go back again.
Newton and the other Server did a marvelous job."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch as soon as I walked in I was greeted by a friendly server, didn't catch her name and ordered the cali roll. I asked if they can make the crab spicy, and the chef did it and OMG was so yummy. I don't really like cali rolls but these were so simple and flavorful and FRESH! What I like most about the sushi was the filling, so much, and not a lot of clunky rice. can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend the other night for dinner.  The Service was good, the space was clean.  The average Roll Price ranges from $5 to $8  with some special rolls costing a bit more.  We split about 4 Rolls and each had a Kirin. The California Crunch rolls were tasty, the spicy Crab was a big hit with my friend, and the Crunchy Tempura Shrimp with eel sauce was my favorite.  

We also tried one of their many special rolls, we went for the \"Booty Booty Roll\" not just for the name but because it seemed to have a complex flavor profile.  based on our personal tastes, we didn't find the  Booty Booty Roll to be 

\"Rockin Everywhere\"

but it was good, just maybe too many flavors at once, I would probably go for something simpler next time.  I also saw some of the other food coming out of the kitchen and it looked good, and being that the thought of raw fish would disgust my wife I know she'd be able to find something to eat too.

I plan to come back soon."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi spot! After moving here recently we tried every place within a 15 mile radius and this is hands down the best. Service is amazing...they are happy to serve you. The owner and his wife are the sweetest- shes also the greatest server. Did I mention the bathroom is so clean that I could eat in it?  Quality fish, products, and you cannot beat their lunch special. Blows Uni Sushi down the street out of the darn water. Try the salmon!!!"}
{"text":"Had the bulgogi bowl and it was pretty darn good. Vegetables were fresh, meat was flavorful and tender, and rice was well done. 

This is the type of local place that deserves your business."}
{"text":"FIRST LOVE ROLL!!! Best roll ever. I've had a lot of sushi but this roll is the perfect balance of taste. You'd think \"eew, lemon on a sushi roll, no thanks\" but in fact it is the best thing that will ever happen to you. I've since moved from Arizona but still think about this roll."}
{"text":"The only thing going for this place is the lemon roll.  Its dark and dingy, poor servers  who don't know the menu and when they make mistakes MULTIPLE times they're rude to you. We asked for the salmon ROE 3 times and the server said that's not salmon roll  ( we asked for ROE) every times she brought out some random roll.  Even after we pointed to the menu with the picture she continued to bring the wrong thing.  On that note  when we finally got \" salmon ROE \" it was definitely sturgeon Roe not salmon Roe.  We also got the Japanese dumpling soup which turned out to be potstickers in ramen broth with alot of cabbage for $12. Our son had the teriyaki plate as there's no kids menu but he said it was good."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time a couple weeks ago.  When I go for sushi, it pretty much consists of Nigiri Tuna and California rolls, I'm not a hardcore sushi eater by any sorts.

Service was good, was seated right away, took my drink order, came out.. My drink never got empty before a replacement came out (big plus for me).  I ordered one of their sushi meal things and requested it all be tuna (you get to pick), GF orders something, I think it was Teryaki beef..

Couple minutes goes by, another lady comes out and tells me I cant have all Tuna cause its too expensive.  Hey.. I'm an easy going guy, I shrug my shoulders and say, \"cant you chuck another $5 on my bill to make up for it?\".   I'm not sure what she said, but apparently that was ok :)

Food comes out, I had a bite of my GF's meal and the beef was cooked very nicely and the sauce was great!  My sushi was good, you cant really expect too much out of Tuna and California Rolls other then they just be fresh.

I noticed they have some nice Happy Hour stuff.  There was a flier floating around inside that said it was 2:30-4:30pm, looked like some good deals.  When I was leaving, the window said a different time for the Happy Hour special, no biggie.. I might go back and check it out"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good, staff was incredibly friendly/attentive! Food was tasteful and fulfilling! Sue! She was my waitress and was super!! I will definitely return! And will spread the word about this restaurant! I recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and very friendly staff, the husband and wife team running the place are great.  Any sushi place that has real wasabi is ok by me.  All of the rolls we had were great and the baked lobster roll was the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"First off... I come to sushi places for the Veggie rolls and appetizers. I don't do any of the rolls with fish... 

I had the veggie roll & the cucumber roll. My friend and I shared the gyoza which were great. My rolls were as expected.. and in my book that was good. My only complaint and its minor.. but I asked for the avacado to be swapped out with cream cheese.. she said there would be an extra charge for this....?? I decided to keep the avacado..  anyway, my friend had the california rolls and was pleased enough with them. 

So, for a small quaint little place.. It was good."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place. The sushi is awesome and the service is great. One of the best sushi bars I have been to. They have always taken care of me and whoever I bring in. No matter how much we spend they always throw in some extra here and there. I have been coming here for about 2 years this place will continue to be my only sushi spot when I'm home. Thank you for your great food and service Fresh Wasabi!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here frequently. We have tried other sushi restaurants, but nothing even comes close to this place! My personal favorite is the Little Mermaid Roll and the Spicy Tuna Roll. My husband usually gets the Vegas Roll, Tootsie Roll and  tries something new for his third choice. Everything new we try we love, but still have our favorites! 

Overall this place has a really nice atmosphere. It's small and dimly lit which is good for us romantics :). It's usually pretty quiet so there's no need to shout like in busier restraints. The service has always been wonderful and we have never had any complaints. You will see the same two women serving consistently and you will love them.  

A complete list of our favorites:
The little mermaid roll
Spicy tuna or salmon (the crunch ones are good too)
Tootsie roll
Dynamite roll
Las Vegas roll
Godzilla roll"}
{"text":"I come from Seattle, and we have LOTS of good sushi there. Went last night with my best friend who is visiting here from Seattle, and it was hands down the BEST sushi I've ever tasted anywhere.  The beef yakisoba noodles had the best spices/herbs we've both ever tried. 
My sushi was fantastic, I had the Booty Booty roll and the Four Seasons roll. I will go back and try every single other thing on the menu. Best part? I don't have to go allllll the way over to Snottsdale to find quality Japanese. Oh, and the portions are good. I could NOT finish the 2 rolls, brought the rest home.
Ok, we went again last night 5/29/2010, and we were all pleased as punch. My sis from sacto, who is a veteran Sushi lover, was in heaven. The 4 of us shared the Booty-Booty Roll, Catapillar Roll, Cherry Blossom roll, and Rainbow Roll. Also Shrimp Tempura, and grilled makarel. It was great, licked up every bite. 
I don't understand WHY my review is 'filtered' or held back from the other reviews? Have I offended someone somehow??"}
{"text":"It was good! Fresh Wasabi is an inexpensive, small, and simple restaurant. If I wanted amazing sushi then I wouldnt have gone there - I would have spent a $100 at an expensive sushi bar. BUT I was craving eel sauce and ginger and plain old sushi and I was on a budget- It was delicious and didnt disappoint for the amount of money I was spending. I spent $50 for my family of 4(2 kids and 2 adults)! We left stuffed. That included appetizers, sides, and sushi- 5 rolls. the Climax roll was my favorite. I will come again for a quick sushi trip!

They kept my kids happy and our waters full!! Thanks again."}
{"text":"First, the servers are unfriendly which made an unpleasant experience in and of itself. Secondly, I ordered a ton of food and wanted to use the Yelp check in which they denied. Thirdly, the food was not great and gets worse every time I've eaten there.The avocado appetizer shrinks upon each visit. Lastly, my niece and I got brutally sick immediately after eating there. I do not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Refused to honor the Yelp coupon and they were very rude about it. No explanation. The restaurant was totally deserted at dinner time. Not a good sign. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere is a little plain and has a lingering odor of their fish(from the sushi bar), it makes up for it with their food. The sushi was delicious and tasted fresh. I don't quite understand the 10% gratuity fee for take out when the prices are already a little high, but I do plan to come back and try more on the menu."}
{"text":"I love Japanese so I was very excited to try Fresh Wasabi Sushi & Grill.  Since it was girls day out we all planned to pay for our own lunch.  It was a nice surprise when we walked in, good decor and booths.  We had seen the menu on the outside of the restaurant so we knew we wanted to try... the Bento boxes.  We were planning to use our Yelp coupon but when the waitress saw our coupon she said we could not order the Bento Boxes and only one coupon per table.  We explained that we did not see that on the coupon.  She eventually came around and let us use two coupons and one of us was allowed to order the B.B.  The food was good and met my expectations for fresh sushi.  It was $16 for a large portion of sushi, soup & salad.  The salad was a little weak, maybe not fresh enough.  The soup was very tasty and the Bento Box was very generous and much to my friends liking.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great local sushi spot! Love their Vegas Roll and Cherry Blossom Roll.  Staff is very friendly.  Always seem on top of refills.  Has kind of a mini sports bar feel with a couple of TVs but without all the loudness.  The prices are very reasonable as well.  I recommend this spot over the other one across the street."}
{"text":"Used to go here and enjoy.  Service/food/portions all were good.  Two months ago bought the restaurant.com 10 for $25.  Went last month.  Disaster:  food was still good.  The service was deplorable-clear down to arguing over her mistake on the use of the coupon.  Went again last night-used to the $10 for $25.  Now the food while good have been shrunk to ridiculous.  They should be ashamed to put it on the plate.  From the rolls to the shashimi (which you could read a kindle through).  Then it's time to check out (same rude waitress).  I look and sure enough same game.  When I complain this time though she suddenly remembers and proceeds to rant 4 different times that she took it on the chin last time for $7.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  You don't want people using coupons-don't put them out there-only to have them come in and then cheat them.   I have two more of these coupons and WILL NOT BOTHER to go back.  I do not expect them to be in business another 6 mos.
I have quite a few friends that I have turned on to this place and have become regulars there.  Will certainly tell them not to bother to go back.  If they saw the sashimi and roll shrinkage, they would be appalled."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, even though the customer service is poor."}
{"text":"Wow! I've been coming here for years under the old management and like it then. Now, wow! I love the uniqueness of all the food. Spicy and just delicious. I had the habanero salmon roll and it is now my favorite. If it's been awhile since you have come here, try it out! Very good food and like no other sushi I've had. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"First time here and love it. My 9-year-old daughter does not like sushi, but after she started tasting my sushi on my plate she now loves sushi."}
{"text":"New owners are sooo awesome! Their new menu has incredible options! The quality of sushi is so much better than previous owners! We tried 4 different rolls and loved them all!"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant on the west side. The fish is always fresh and the hospitality is wonderful. We ABSOLUTELY love going to Fresh Wasabi for our family night out! Thank you"}
{"text":"our favorites are the miso soup, mermaid and baked lobster roll! I take my kids here often, we love it!  The atmosphere is nice, the kids enjoy sitting and watching them make the rolls.  The lunch specials are very affordable the customer service is great.  very clean too!"}
{"text":"Finally Surprise AZ has a great Sushi hangout...  Loved it. Owners are super friendly and the Sushi is amazing.  The baked dish took a little long to cook,  but was worth it.  The Spicy Scallop on the A La Carte menu was fabulous."}
{"text":"great value in yelp offer. just remember this is a business, in business. good fish costs bucks. respect it, folks. don't abuse it!
DESPITE THE LOCATION, THIS SUSHI SPOT IS LEGIT!

--great tako sunomono. tender and bittersweet. nice.
--miso soup spot on.
--salmon skin hand roll. ftw.

#veg tempura was crispy but not flakey.

squished in a corner of this impossible strip mall along the Bell Rd abyss of consumerism shopping hell, this jewel of a japanese eatery blesses the area with your favorites, prepared in proper japanese style.

can't wait for my next meal there!"}
{"text":"This place gets FREE advertising by having a coupon in the Entertainment Book and then refuses to honor it. I would not even know it existed except for finding the location in the book. We live in central Phoenix and only come to Surprise every other month to pick up our granddaughters to spend the weekend. If we had gotten to try the place and liked the food and atmosphere, we might have come back again to eat dinner after dropping the girls off on a Sunday evening. It is the principle that is wrong here, and why we did not stay to eat after seeing the blatant notice on the front door that they will not honor the coupons. Bad business."}
{"text":"Treated ourselves to a late afternoon, pre-dinner crowd rush, Valentine's Day meal at Fresh Wasabi yesterday. Being a small operation, the ambiance has always been a bit austere, but we immediately noticed some new decor and wall hangings, very lovely! We also noticed that they made a distinct effort at romance for the day with fresh red roses on the tables, many of the staff wearing some red, and a fun display at the greeting station.

We were greeted warmly and happily by the owner and seated at our regular table. We tried the cherry blossom roll, baked lobster roll, and the bronze medal roll this time. All were phenomenal, but we cannot imagine ordering the baked lobster roll without the bronze medal roll at the same time, they were perfectly complimentary to one another!  We paired the cherry blossom with a couple pieces of yellow tail nigiri, very soft and tender with perfect flavor, and we were happy with the match.

As always, presentation was spot-on and the service was great! It was an unexpectedly fun Valentine's meal! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Many places don't give you that much fish and a lot of rice in their rolls, but the ratio of fish-to-rice was perfect! A great balance. Flavors were some of the best we've had in the valley. We recommend \"Cherry Blossom\". Definitely will be returning"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great and the staff is always very nice. Food take a little bit to come out but other than that, sushi is really good!"}
{"text":"I was REALLY hungry, so I called in three rolls to go. When I got home with them, I found them to be so small that it made me angry. For $35, I got a tiny appetizer. I've never seen rolls made so small. I had to call and have a pizza sent to my room for dinner. I eat sushi all the time."}
{"text":"prices paid didnt reflect to go prices. fresh but war from rice. enjoy the sushi from frys fore."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since it under new management.  Definitely looks better and cleaner.  I was put off by the hostess.  She welcomed us with a mouth full of ramen which she pointed out \"sorry, I have a mouth full of ramen.\"  She then seated us and complimented my highlights in my hair, followed by \"I'm too Mexican to dye my hair.\" What?! It was weird.  When they declined to use the gift card we'd received under previous management (not upset, I understand things happen) we decided to leave.  She was very unprofessional.  We might go back and try the new menu sometime, but hopefully she can gain some professionalism before then..."}
{"text":"Alright, a brief disclaimer: this is not Scottsdale's Ra Sushi or Sushi a-Go-Go, what it IS is a small sushi business operated near a Walmart shopping center. That being said, I have been to this particular sushi bar multiple times and have NEVER been disappointed in their food or service. Restaurant is clean and modern; sushi rolls are tight and well-made, not overly decorated or doused with goopy sauces. Expect to pay ~$8 per \"regular\" roll (ie, spicy tuna, california) and $12+ for specialty rolls. Their rainbow roll here is to DIE for. Miso soup and side salads are NOT included with sushi order, nor are there very many \"specials\" or enticing happy hour menus. I hope to see that improve in the near future."}
{"text":"Came back here for the first time since they first opened and I did not review it the first time because it was a 2-3 star experience and I wanted to give it another try.  I can certainly understand why Jennifer and Jojo wrote a bad review for this place because the 67ave & Bell location gives this place very large shoes to fill.  The first time I came here the sushi was small and the taste was not memorable but when we came back yesterday the sushi was as good as the Bell road location.  We ordered some of our favorites like the \"climax\", \"school bus\", \"spicy tuna lover\" and one other I cant remember right now but it was good too.  I really like their specialty rolls here and on Tuesday's they have \"by one get one half off\".  We stuffed ourselves and had a few drinks.  They have some beer selections but they only have 2 alcohols (vodka & crown royal) so don't come here for the drinking, that is what Squid Ink is for.  The service was OK, and the atmosphere is very casual.  The whole room is about 30 by 30 in size with about 12-15 tables inside.  Nothing fancy but the sushi is worth coming here, I'm not a fan of Squid Ink unless I'm going over for drinks at a happy hour."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls were very good.  I would recommend the dynamite roll.  Only had one guy helping during dinner rush.  He hustled and did a good job."}
{"text":"Fresh Wasabi is under new Management! Kevin is back from way back when! Food and conversation was amazing last night! Best of luck Kevin!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time today and WOW!!!!!  Hubby had Beef Yakisoba (requested to be spicy), I had a Double Shrimp Roll (had shrimp inside + on top) and we shared a Loco Spicy Jack Roll (one of 3 specials listed which had jalapeño inside).  The sushi were SOOO tasty and the Yakisoba was SOOO authentic!!  This is the first time we have found Yakisoba that tastes like what you get in the small, local mom-and-pop restaurants in Japan.  I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here. You're better off going to Fry's market and getting their pre-rolled sushi. Sushi rolls tasteless, small portions, no heart. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Wow I am also surprised to see some of the reviews this place has received. My wife and I love to go to this location. The food is great, service is awesome and the prices are reasonable. Plus we like to hit their specials during happy hour. I hope more people check this place out, I know each visit I have made I have been very pleased.i have been to this location about 5 times and they have never let me down. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go, service and food was fast and delicious!  That climax roll is no joke!  Will eat from there again for sure."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped by for a quick early dinner. We were the only patrons, which I don't mind. The hostess was very nice and explained the menus. I ordered the bulgogi bento box and husband ordered two yellowtail rolls. The sushi was out within five minutes, followed closely by the bento box. The bento box was much larger than expected and the variety of items was good. Husband said the yellowtail had good flavor, just wasn't as cold as he prefers. Overall, great super fast little restaurant!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me take out Sushi (caliroll) it was pretty tasty!!! Yummy! I'm coming back!!"}
{"text":"Good food, but overpriced.

I got a combo and it was $32.
also they charge 10% on to-go orders.

What? No thanks.  There is better sushi in the surprise/Peoria area for much less.

Mini history lesson:
\"Sometimes in the 90s tipping was 10%-15%, it increased after 2000 to about 18%, eventually reaching 20% in some areas by 2010's.   Some generous people will push it even farther to 21-22%.  Tipping has never been required and is always on the customer whether they choose to or not.\"

But to make 10% mandatory on a to-go order before taxes, NO NO NO
Kabuki does To-go orders for free, and their boxes are beautiful and customized.

they don't charge for some leaky generic Styrofoam."}
{"text":"Decent sushi. The specials could be better priced. But the food was good and comfortable atmosphere. If you like to indulge in a few adult beverages, it looked like they had some good specials in that department, but I was unable to partake at the time."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to eat some really good sushi. I come here a few times a week with a variety of friends and all have loved it. The service had been awesome and specials are well within everybody's budget. Gotta try it!! Keep up the great stuff"}
{"text":"First visit was great. I had chicken yakatori and edamame. The wife had sushi, which she loved. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Good sushi.  One of my favorites was the Guilty Pleasure Roll:  spicy tuna, covered with Hawaiian white tuna, jalapeno, garlic, tobiko, nuts, eel sauce, spicy mayo and creamy wasabi sauce.  

We asked if they could make us a spicy salmon roll since it wasn't on the menu, but they said they couldn't.  I find that really weird.  

Anywhoo, skip the cheesecake tempura and get the chocolate mochi.  It's yummy!"}
{"text":"I don't eat sushi so I had the double crunch roll. My husband  sushi I think their food was amazing"}
{"text":"Was headed towards a bad decision lunch at Panda Express until I decided I should really give this place a try. There wasn't a solid vegetarian choice for lunch so I opted for the Teriyaki Salmon. Order that - $10.95 and 15 minutes. Grab my bag and head back to the office. Open it up to see a chunk of salmon atop of pile of soggy cabbage, a lump of white rice, a small green salad, a scoop of potato salad, and a dumpling of some sort. There's a separate container with a few pieces of vegetable tempura. 

Salad was tasty but warm, potato salad was weird...there might have been cucumbers in there, the salmon was overcooked and dry, and I didn't eat the dumpling since it appeared to have chicken. The tempura was rather tasty but nothing extraordinary. 

I'd recommend they lose the potato salad, fill that space with the tempura, and put the green salad in the separate container. Hot green salads are a bummer on top of a \"eh\" meal.

I doubt I'll be back. Steamed vegetables and chow mein at Panda would have probably been a better choice..."}
{"text":"These guys at fresh wasabi microwaved my hamaichi Kama - scary!!!! Go to Sushi Brokers in Scottsdale for consistent and fresh sushi. Sorry this place does not cut it for me. Sushi rice was vinegary!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but more upset that they add 10 percent gratuity  to all takeout orders. That should be my choice. Not thrilled!"}
{"text":"The sushi was ok, not the best I've ever had but just ok. I would LOVE to not be disappointed by AZ sushi, but my search goes on."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and great service!! The food always comes out quickly. We love eating here! Best sushi restaurant in Surprise"}
{"text":"Just like any other sushi place with a high pricing for the average quality"}
{"text":"TASTY!!  Great food, nice friendly people, pleasant atmosphere.  The owner greets you coming in and checks on you during your meal.  They make you feel welcome and you can tell that lots of people return frequently.  Fresh fish and creative combinations that are served in eye pleasing arrangements.  Cherry Blossom Roll was beautiful and tasty! I grew up in Japan and love sushi so this place will always have a fond memory in my belly and taste buds.  Not big but comfortable surroundings.  Prices also are good and actually cheap compared to other sushi places I've been to."}
{"text":"Great sushi place! Definitely will come back again. Being from Seattle, I missed good sushi, so I'm excited we'd try it!!"}
{"text":"First things first. This place needs to put some money into the restaurant. The chairs are damaged and mine had duct tape on it in an attempt to fix the upholstery. If they don't plan on updating, their prices are way too high. It's a dump, if you want to charge regular prices you need to upgrade. I ordered veggie rolls, so I can't speak on the quality or freshness of the fish. My rolls were \"ok\". They kept falling apart and the taste was fine, nothing special. The waitress was also rude. It's a place I would go to for a cheap happy hour, they don't have much else to offer."}
{"text":"Friendly waiters, efficient cooks, and good food. The seaweed salad is darn good and the sushi taste amazing. The sushi is fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I had my son's wedding dinner (small party) at Fresh Wasabi. We were greeted outside the restaurant by the owner. Our server was very sweet and attentive. The food was excellent as well. It's a very quaint family like atmosphere. My youngest son insists we go there and only there for sushi. He & I had dinner a there a couple weeks ago, nothing has changed. The excellent food and service were not a fluke. I am so excited I found this place in November. I plan on becoming one of their many regulars although I've only been there twice. I will have my son's 14th birthday dinner at Fresh Wasabi per his request. I highly recommend this place. I am a huge sushi fan, food and service like Fresh Wasabi provides is hard to find."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and loved it both times! I've tried several different basic rolls (yellow tail, tuna, Philadelphia) and loved them all. The rice used is great! Also tried salmon, tuna, and Hawaiian tuna nigiri and the fish is GREAT quality and really clean crisp flavors with everything! Both sushi chefs were friendly and fun to talk to and the waitress I had both times with the tattoos is super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The first time I went and it was very busy but I still did not have a long wait for my food and it was a great atmosphere! The second time I went, hardly anyone was there and I had a great conversation with another customer and the sushi chef. Really good prices on food and drinks! I live in the neighborhood and will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Sushi is average, I would way below average.
Pricing is slightly above average.
Portions are very small. I always order sushi with tuna, but since it is expensive, they give you tiny pieces, and bulk-up on the cheap stuff."}
{"text":"This is the only sushi restaurant my wife and I will eat at in the Phoenix area. We've tried Tomo's, Nakama and the horrible sushi place in WestGate, but Fresh Wasabi is the best. Everything is always fresh and delicious. We usually get the Alaska, Phoenix and Tootsie rolls. They offer a military discount, and one of the sushi chefs is ex-Army and likes to come out and greet fellow military personnel."}
{"text":"Already overpriced for small rolls, they now charge a 10% gratuity on takeout orders. I used to be a customer. I won't step foot in that place again. Greed."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas Roll for happy hour was AWESOME! We also had their Loco Roll. The Loco Roll was good. It reminded me of one of the rolls I get for a quick sushi fix at Fry's Foods. The place is very small. The windows are covered with a white sheet like material, held together with duct tape to give it a more darker ambiance. There was no one in the place at 3:30pm when me and my son went in, which was 03/18/2016, so I guess I was expecting decent service. That expectation flew out the window, after we were served our rolls. The entire staff, and I mean the two female servers and the two guys behind the counter decided it was time for them to eat, because we were forgotten about at that point. After we finished our rolls, which was about 8 minutes, I was expecting one of them,(and all 4 of them were about 20 feet away) to ask us if we wanted anything else. YES we did want more of those Vegas rolls! But after 10 minutes of waiting and still no service, I stood up and walked half way to their table as to \"Not disturb\" their lunch/dinner break while their only two paying customers were patronizing their establishment, waited in hand, with my credit card hoping to have them check us out so I could go to another restaurant and get my fill. It took them another 3 minutes for them to acknowledge me standing there. That being said, I will not go back, even though the Vegas Rolls ROCKED! The service and atmosphere leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that I am from Chicago (and still live there, mind you)... and am a regular sushi eater at some of the best sushi restaurants in a city that is known for, and loves, its food.

With that said, I have been to Fresh Wasabi twice now and... can state with confidence that Fresh Wasabi is some of the best sushi I have ever eaten!  Try the First Love specialty roll -- you will love it!  Have you tried it yet?  Seriously, what are you waiting for?  Ok, since you are still reading this, then let me give another recommendation -- try the Crunch Spicy Tuna.  You say it looks a little boring for your exquisite, developed taste buds?  Then tell them to add tobiko (they will do it with a smile).  Have you tried the rolls yet?  Go.  Eat.  Now!"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. We ordered the Shrimp Tempura Crunchy Roll and it tasted burnt. The Dynamite Roll tasted like hot mayonnaise and burnt mushrooms. The yellowtail sushi was dry and definitely not fresh. The albacore was pale, dry and completely unappetizing. And when our family of 5 walked out without even eating they didn't even ask if anything was wrong. If you love sushi, don't go here!"}
{"text":"Tried this recently looking for some teriyaki.  This was disappointing.  It was not crisp, which I like, and I didn't care for dipping sauce, too bland.  It was a little high priced for what we got.  Will not go back for the teriyaki."}
{"text":"Great experience, they were nice, everything on the menu sounds delicious and everything that we got was amazing!"}
{"text":"Ok maki, but everything else kinda sucked.  Went about 1 to have the lunch specials with my hubby.
The good: 
The rolls were great, like I said.
 The tempura, not bad.
The not-good:
Spicy tuna rolls were not tasty and a little warm.
Salad in the bento box was crap.
Edamame was not warm or appetizing.
Spicy chicken may not have been chicken and was not very spicy either.
My vote, skip it."}
{"text":"I just moved here from San Diego, this place is down the street from our new home it is DELICIOUS! YUMMMMMERS"}
{"text":"My husband and I are fairly well versed in sushi restaurants.  This place is WAY overpriced and the food is subpar at best. They don't have a kids menu and they refused to make just a bowl of noodles for our 3 year old.  It took forever for service and then forever for our food.  The best tasting thing was the miso soup, bulgogi was bland, sushi was bland, calamari was overfried and just not good.  Service wasn't great either.  So overall we just spent $40 on a bland dinner and won't be coming back.  Sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Under new ownership.  The miso soup was the best!  The mixed tempura appetizer was good, especially the shrimp. The Golden Avocado appetizer was really good. Will definitely come back again soon. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times seeing that it's the only real sushi place in Surprise. Good sushi/sashimi, good atmosphere (I love the little places), and quick service are what make this place great."}
{"text":"I tried this place since its the closest place to my home but I have to say I was disappointed with the quality and portion size of their sushi rolls for the cost. I much rather drive several miles to Nakama on McDowell Rd in Goodyear!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We used the yelp deal and the check in special. We had 3 specialty rolls, an order of dumplings and an order of calamari and our bill was $17. ($15 for the yelp deal + $17 on the actual bill = $32.) We saved almost 50% and the food was fantastic. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We used to frequent this restaurant, especially for carry out until the started adding a 10% surcharge on all carry out orders. I had forgotten about that when my daughter asked if we could pick up sushi for dinner. 

We ordered two regular rolls, a specialty roll and some nigiri for $78.95. Their prices have gone up significantly since we've eaten there and the fish quality has seriously diminished. My wife even said her nigiri didn't even feel like real fish. 

The male owner, though I didn't see him tonight, is very nice as are the young waitresses who I believe are his daughters. The one woman though who I believe is the co-owner is just plain rude. 

If they could go back to how it was when they first opened with reasonable prices and great sushi, I could recommend this place but not anymore."}
{"text":"Closed on Sundays.

This place has super friendly service.  I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and though it was good, the taste of bamboo shoots was strong.  The hubs had their spicy pork bento box and he enjoyed it very much.  

We've been here a few times and the menu and restaurant layout has changed almost every time we've been there.  Hope this place is here to stay though."}
