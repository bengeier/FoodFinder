{"text":"Bistro O'Quai is perfect for a date or special occasion because of the view and location. We went a few hours before sunset, so I imagine that the view just gets better from there, but don't quote me!   Most of us ordered drinks which looked pretty and reportedly tasted really good, so even if you just come for drinks and apps, you'll be satisfied. The nachos that I ordered were a very, very large portion which is really saying something coming from a Texas girl. Be prepared to share! I was told that the duck confit is 100% the way to go if you're into that. I ordered the caramel crepe dessert which didn't really taste like a crepe, but it was a refreshing end to the meal. The server also brought me a passion fruit mousse dessert to try which was sweet, rich, and sour- an interesting combo to say the least! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great location on the Old Port. Enjoyed outdoor seating for the Montreal 375 Celebration. We just had drinks and appetizers. I had the Shrimp Ceviche with corn chips and guacamole which was excellent and gluten free! My hubby had the Nachos which he said were typical and had a Cheese Wiz cheese. Because it was very windy, food and glasses were flying off the tables! It was quite busy so the service was a bit slow but we didn't mind. It's a great place to hang out on a nice day or evening. There is also a small indoor bar. I was surprised it wasn't on Yelp, so I added it and hope you enjoy it when you're in Old Town Montreal."}
