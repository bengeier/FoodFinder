{"text":"The food and drinks are blah, but the service is always great! Happy hour and trivia are always fun at Skip & Jan's."}
{"text":"I went to have a few drinks while my boyfriend sang a few karaoke songs and had to beg when ordering drinks. the 40ish curly haired working alone bartender on a NOT BUSY Friday night  was so NOT in the mood to be there obviously was aloof to be honest and must have had P.M.S.  Not my choice in spending a Friday night . Tipped her 20 percent and not even a thankyou ... for coming in NOTHING but attitude why would anyone waste their night out to beg be insulted and ignored???"}
{"text":"Best place to play pool and drinks at low prices."}
{"text":"Off track betting, huge pool area, cheap breakfast on the weekends.  No tv by the darts area"}
{"text":"Wonderfully cheap happy hour and lunch specials. We're talking four dollars for a half-pound burger and drink. The full-price appetizer menu was tasty, but a little expensive for the amount of food. I definitely recommend Skip and Jan's if you're looking to watch a weekend sporting event and want to enjoy some inexpensive food. The service is 5 stars."}
{"text":"We had living social deals. Out server took awhile to check on us then grab our bill. We got wings and beer and were there for 90 minutes! It was dead! We will go back because the wings were awesome and they offered local beer but we will sit at the bar or request a different server because we want to try out the billiards tables!"}
{"text":"I love coming here to sing karaoke and the drinks are great! Expect last night when the owner or the owners husband(I can't remember which) picked me up and tried to corner me while hitting on me. It made me feel super uncomfortable. But overall its a great place to hang out at!"}
{"text":"I've heard that they are moving to the old 1st Round Draft location on the northeast corner of McQueen and Warner Road in Gilbert. Although, I haven't seen any remodeling action going on there."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They have some of the best pool tables in Arizona!  Twelve 7' Diamond tables and twelve 9' tables.  The staff is always friendly and the food is pretty good and the drink prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this place. Natalie the owner is amazing . The breakfast specials are the best . They are 3.99 and for 2$ more a Bloody Mary and screwdriver . Get the breakfast burrito . Super strong drinks . The staff is amazing ."}
{"text":"Perfect for pool and beer. Very laid back, nothing special. One of those places where you just want to relax. You can also gamble on the ponies or a sports game which is awesome. Didn't try the food."}
{"text":"Local sports bar that was surprisingly pleasant once inside. Much larger than expected. Obviously they have pool tournaments by the amount of tables present.  They also have an OTB counter inside which I don't know much about, but don't know of many of them around here.   The staff was pleasant and helpful in choosing something to eat.  The food was typical \"bar food\".  It's nearby, convenient and quite deceiving from the exterior.  Definitely plenty of parking and easy access off of the I 10."}
{"text":"Came over here after work to hang out with some coworkers and my girlfriend. We had a great time. During happy hour for $5 you get a pretty big glass and can have whatever you want in it. That is a great deal. The food was OK. Good bar food but nothing blowing your socks off. Service was OK too. Didn't play any pool this time but they have a large pool table area. The entire other half of the building to be exact and there were a lot of people playing pool over there. My coworkers and I will definitely be back for happy hour after work. Since we had such a good time and it is literally right across the street from our work. We haven't done happy hour in quite a while after work and it is nice to find a great place that is right across the street."}
{"text":"I really love playing pool here.  Some of the other reviewers seem to think it's in a bad neighborhood or something,  but I have never seen anything really sketchy happen there. Just seems like your run of the mill strip mall to me.  There is kind of a rowdy parking lot crowd on the weekends since Graham Central Station is in the parking lot , but nothing too crazy.  The staff there are very friendly and helpful and always check on you to make sure you are doing a okay.  They have a very large number of pool tables to play on hourly and per game.  Are they shiny and new? No not at all, but I like the \"Color of Money\" neighborhood pool hall feel.  The few times I have encountered a loose pocket or something off with a table it's been fixed the next time I go in.  The hourly pool rates and food prices are very reasonable and the service is great.  Try the Onion Rings and the Sundae :) you won't regret it.  The other bar food they have is nothing new or different, but very good by bar standards.    I would have given this place 5 stars, but they have 3 nights a week they do pool leagues so you can't play during those times.  Which is cool I should probably join a pool league anyway.  If you play pool you should go in and have some fun."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one star, but only because there is no \"zero\" option.  We bought a Groupon deal and went for lunch that day.  First of all, when we drove up to the parking lot, I seriously thought the place had closed down...the building looked decrepit and the parking lot was empty.  It was around 11:00 and I thought maybe they just weren't open so I went up to try the doors and they were open.  I walked inside and it was empty with the exception of the two girls behind the counter (neither one approached or acknowledged me) but at least I knew they were open.  I really wish they hadn't been.  The server was so rude (contintually) and at first, I thought, maybe the food will make up for it,  but then I realized that I would have to see her for at least 45 minutes and that was enough to kill my appetite.  I read the other reviews  and I don't know where all the \"friendly\" servers were...maybe all the friendly servers  work at night when everyone is partying?  Anyway, I told to server to cancel our drink orders, we were going back home (to get a refund on our Groupon)  Yeah, it was that bad, because of one person and I hope the owners realize that with rude servers comes no business (mine and everyone esle I will tell my experience to)"}
{"text":"Great customer service. The food is amazing. Everyone is so friendly. Must try the Taco's."}
{"text":"First time here I wanted to check it out. It used to be First Round Draft. I ordered wings. Lets just say I have had better wings just about everywhere than here. They were dry. I am used to them being smothered with wing sauce. Barely any sauce on them, Inside is very plain. They totally gutted the inside, looked like an empty warehouse but I know it wasn't it used to be another bar. They threw some tables in and some pool tables and a bar set up, some TV's and bam you have a sports bar. However nothing in this place stands out and Zipps, Native, BWW, Cogburns, all better choices for at least Wings, ambience and sports.   Service ok. Bartenders not overly friendly but not rude either.   Not impressed."}
{"text":"We came here to teach our 14 & 16 year olds how to shoot pool. The bathrooms are dirty and need an update. The juke box played very vulgar x rated music even though it was early evening/late afternoon. When we suggested that they use more appropriate versions of the songs the bartender said that patrons complain if it isn't the explicit language version. We had the sliders which were good and a pitcher of beer that was not very cold and served with plastic cups."}
{"text":"My experience at this at first seemed great. But as the night went on the bartenders I don't know if it was because they were tired or not but started to cop major attitudes that made me not want to ever go back! Stuck up and rude would be the words I would use to describe the place... It's pretty sad that you pay for a service and receive stuck up attitudes of disrespect! It seemed like they were under the impression that I owed them something.... I left confused and completely unsatisfied! I don't recommended this place for anyone"}
{"text":"Just like when they were on Elliot and Priest, w/o OTB . Super nice, great bar food n drinks."}
{"text":"I came here for pool on a Friday night. The pool tables are good and the service and beer was good. After pool we migrated over to the bar area for karaoke. The karaoke was a blast and I had a great time. I will definitely come back for karaoke again."}
{"text":"I have to say that the food is good and cheap, and the waitresses have always been friendly. Its not the best atmosphere, but heck...its a good sports bar."}
{"text":"Great tables there, 7 Diamond 9 footers, 12 Diamond bar tables and 5 Gold Crown 9 footers that all play very well. Good food and drinks there, service is pretty good too with some friendly waitresses.   I live fairly close and go often for practice and a bite to eat. I would say the only draw back for me is certain nights it is a league night and all the big tables are taken up but that is not really a problem as the place is packed so its a good thing but if you want to play pool on league nights then join a league I guess which I might.   The $50 monthly pool player pass gets you pool all month long whenever you want to play. I would recommend this pool room as a person who plays pool very often, wants a bite to eat or drink. They also have OTB if your into gambling also."}
{"text":"Nestled between the bright lights of the once famous Graham Central Station and a no-name BBQ place is a lovely gem I like to refer to as \"Skips\".  The bar side of this place is nothing too special. Don't get me wrong, its BIG for a bar, but the ambiance and furniture are pretty dated. So, unless you enjoy playing pool, I don't know why you would want to come here.  That being said, the pool here is great!  They just got around 15 brand new Diamond 7' tables which play AWESOME.  Their 9' tables also play well, but they have some PRETTY unforgiving pockets.  So if you are a beginner, I wouldn't play on the big tables unless you like to be frustrated.  They have no house cues on the floor.  you have to rent them up at the bar for $1.00.  This is great because they can maintain a better quality cue for you (if you use house cues).  Their food is actually REALLY good! I've had their Turkey Burger which was moist and delicious.  It comes with a nicely sized basket of fries.  Also, their Nachos are ridiculous good (That's saying a lot coming from me)! The only bad thing about their nachos is that they use that liquid fake cheese... I prefer shredded blends on my nachos.  The waitresses there are uber friendly. Yes, UBER! They always make a point to remember your name and they are always SOOO busy! Make sure to tip them well. They will remember you!  Wednesday night is league night there, so unless you want to watch, avoid Wednesday from 7-10pm. Oh, and HH is from 2-7 and lots of the food (including the nachos and Turkey Burger) are priced to sell!  Go shoot some pool!"}
{"text":"My one complaint is them moving to Gilbert and not being right up the street from me in Tempe! Cheap drinks, food, and pool tables. Super friendly bartenders as well."}
{"text":"This place has the best lunch specials in the east valley, For only 3.99 you have a choice of over 10 items. I have had the gyros, turkey burger, wings and chicken burrito. It also come with your choice of soda or draft domestic beer. Wow !! All for $3.99 and add a side for a $1.00. Don't expect anything special for the service. It's just ok. Watch your favorite game, play some billiards or bet on the ponies. Come as you are and have some fun !! The owners, Natalie and Todd are very cool !"}
{"text":"I took my grandma to eat there on Saturday August 5 around 2 o clock we sat down and waited 10 min no waiter then we see the bartender come to a table next to us and bring them wine he then goes back wait another 5 minutes still no service I see the bartender talking to customers and checking on a table across the room so I get up and go to bar to ask him if we have a server he walks back and fourth getting beers for people at the bar like three times still ignoring me I stood there for another 5 min till I finally got the hint and left will never go there again thought I would give you a try I live in chandler down the street but never again that was really upsetting. I wasted 30 min for no service at all."}
{"text":"Pool tables are horrible! Service sucks. Waitress stopped by once to ask for orders then brought wrong order, Didn`t even stop by again to ask for something else. We are a group of players that usually play together and we will never go there again."}
{"text":"Fun place to go and hang out with friends after work, to watch sporting events, to do karaoke. Perfect location. Decent food. Nice tall glasses with plenty of drink in them to quench your thirsty palate.   A little loud with music playing in background but a fun place nonetheless. Friday nights there is trivia and that was a lot of fun. Participated in that and all of us were having fun answering the various questions and topics. Really a cool atmosphere if you like the sports bar scene."}
{"text":"I just visited Arizona and found this really cool Sports Bar with great food, atmosphere & fun! Everybody was so nice & friendly! Great Drinks & lots of pool tables. It was exceptionally clean. Loved the place and the bartenders & service. Looking forward to visiting there again!!! Best Chicken Wings Ever!"}
{"text":"So let's say it's lunch, and you're in Tempe, and you're craving a cheeseburger and a beer for around $6... good luck finding that anywhere else but here.  Is it a dive?  Sure it is.  Do they have random folk betting on horse races at 11 am?  Yep.  Do dudes rocking hydraulic billiards triangles frequent a place like this?  You betcha.  Can you buy condoms in the bathroom?  Absolutely.  Seriously though, the food is good, the beer is nice & cold and the people watching, as you can tell, is top notch.  Far from gourmet, but an excellent choice in my book - and I suppose if you are looking for a place to play some pool or bet on horses you could do that too."}
{"text":"We've been here a hand full of times. Always nice people working the bar/register. Plenty of tables to get your game on. They've got a couple video games and a couple dart boards as well. In the bar, they've got karaoke, which is fun to watch.  Its right across from Graham Central Station (never been there but always crowded parking lot).  Good place to play some pool and have a beer."}
{"text":"I love this place for happy hour. Good food and drink specials. I think their \"Jan's way' wings are some of the best wings in town. Friendly staff is always nice."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, Skip & Jan's is a pool hall on one side and a sports bar/OTB parlor on the other. If that's your thing, this is your place. The food is not spectacular but nobody comes here to eat. They run pool leagues several nights a week, have a dozen 9 foot tables and 15 or so bar boxes. The tables are well used but they get recovered on a semi-regular basis. The service is always great, especially if you're in a league or a regular. I've been shooting here for years and enjoy the competition.  *Update-this place has closed. I have heard they opened a new location in the east valley that is nicer than the old one but a little smaller."}
{"text":"I have been chilling at the spot for years now... Betting on horses, dogs and shooting pool it can be a really fun place... Plus if you're looking for a really cheap lunch so you can gamble the rest of your money away this is a must stop for some lunch time fun. I rate the food as followed.  Wings - C Turkey Burger - C Double Cheeseburger - C  But for all of these under $3.99 lunches what can you expect... I will be back again just to gamble and have a drink and eat some cheap food."}
{"text":"I totally suck at pool; however, when my friend comes into town when he's on leave from the Army, I'll meet him here for drinks.   For those that are saying this place is in a sketch area: Please, really?! I've seen worse in parts of Scottsdale.   Never have had any of their bar food offerings, but that's usually because we'll go somewhere nicer for dinner prior.   Edit 4/15: Best fried pickles EVER. They're even spicy, woohoo!   Awesome drink specials. He introduced me to one of their \"bubble gum\" vodka drinks - not a big frou frou drink kind of gal, but wowee that hits the spot!   Fun atmosphere. The hourly pool rates are pretty reasonable according to him - I have nothing to compare it to.   Check out Skip & Jan's if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I met up with a few ladies here for drinks a few weeks back at the suggestion of someone else. We didn't end up playing pool, just enjoyed our drinks at the bar before moving over to a table. We were definitely over dressed and probably out of place, but it was a chill place to let loose. Drinks were okay, food was nothing outstanding, prices were to be expected."}
{"text":"Don't go here if unless you're an old fixture in here. They cater to the regulars over 65. I went here to try and blow some money on some drinks and music while playing pool and just ended up wasting my 15mins and $9. So we got a pool table and ordered a couple beers. Started playing a game and realized that it was DEAD QUIET. Apparently it is this way for a reason. I did not know I walked into a rest-home until I pumped $5 into the jukebox to play some music. Music started playing and into my 2nd selection, an old guy grabbed the waitress and she later came out with a remote. She proceeded to give the guy the remote, who then turned the music all the way down to an almost nonexistence. The end. We immediately stopped playing, finished our beers, and closed what would have been a very expensive tab if they did not cater to old farts."}
{"text":"I got dragged back here by persistent coworkers, and the knowledge that they have \"Thirsty Thursdays\". For Thirsty Thursday you can get a huge stein full of absolutely any drink you want for only 5 bucks. Hellooooooo vodka! The puke smell is pretty much gone (They removed the carpet). I still don't like the food... but if you get drunk enough, I suppose it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Anyone know why they closed? They looked like they moved out in a hurry! I'm going to miss the wings and the big drafts."}
{"text":"It's a decent pool joint; nothing out of the ordinary. Hot wings were good and not over cooked. Tuna sandwich was actually decent. Had to go up to the bar to order food because we were ignored by the one waitress there."}
{"text":"Awesome place to play pool, get some cheap drinks and eat some fantastic wings (ask for them \"Jan's style\")"}
{"text":"I love coming here! Probably the best dive bar in Tempe. Great prices and specials, lots of pool tables, karaoke, and awesome wings!! If you like them grilled try Jan's Style!"}
{"text":"I love this place for their pool tables. However, don't come for cleanliness. The women's restroom is a disaster and is in great need of remodeling. The food is good, the atmosphere is good. I rated at three because it's fun, friendly, great service. However this place could use an update. It's a pool hall."}
{"text":"This place does not exist anymore..why do not you remove it from YELP? Waste of my time!!!"}
{"text":"I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast \"elites\" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:)   Why they let me play, I'll never know:)  Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)  It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a \"Rodgering\":)  So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)  Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)  When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)  After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than \"regal\" atmosphere:)  They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)  The smell in S&J can only be described as \"extreme humanity\"...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)  S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on \"tap\", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or \"boofay\" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.  It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)  S&J provided a table full of taco \"fixin's\"...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(  They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground \"creature\"...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.  I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, \"beef\"...just not very good \"beef\":(  The hot tray holding the \"meat\" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of \"meat\" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(  But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.  I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(  I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(  One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not \"broiled\"...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)  Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(  Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)  Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).  They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch because they are on my eScrip rewards list.  I wasn't expecting a dark bar... I ordered some chili and it was OK.  It didn't compare to the chili I ate a week earlier at Gallagher's.  The waitress helped me lightly - I asked for some crackers that were not provided automatically.    I may come back here - if I'm in a dark bar mood at lunch.  If so, I'll order something other than the chili."}
{"text":"The food wasn't very good and neither was the service. Also the Groupon gave us a limit of $17.95 per entree and the most expensive thing was only $9. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Lots of pool tables, friendly waitresses, good long islands and they have Guiness on tap. The crowd isn't always the best because of it's location but as long as you are there with a couple of friends it doesn't really matter."}
{"text":"Skip & Jan's is a dream if you like pool and singing. Firstly, I love to play on pool tables that are unforgiving; pool tables that are tough and competitive. Practicing at Skip & Jan's has helped me improve my pool game tremendously. They provide a multitude of tables. They have bar boxes or 7 foot Diamond tables with Simonis Cloth. They also have my favorite which are the old Diamond 9 foot tables and they also have the classic Brunswick 9 foot tables. They have the best tables I have ever seen in Arizona, not to mention that they have karaoke on Friday and Saturday. How fantastic that I can sing a song and get better at pool simultaneously. But wait there's more. You can get a $50 pass at Skip & Jan's to play on any of the tables, any day of the week, for an entire month. That is truly unbelievable. But wait there's more. Skip & Jan's has fantastic chicken wings and the bartenders are awesome! The bartenders are kind and comical and some of the bartenders even let me sing them a song, so that lets you know that they are personable too. I've got to tell you, if you want to improve at pool, eat some great chicken wings, sing karaoke, and see some great service, you better come to Skip & Jan's soon!"}
