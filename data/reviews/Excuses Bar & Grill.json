{"text":"Do you know good music?  If you do, you should be at Excuses every Saturday night from 4-8. Don't laugh at the hours. Go see the Aces - some of the most talented musicians in the Burgh - if you see them and don't like them, I'll buy your next beer.   They are a classic r and b band that rocks. Bubbs just crushes with his soulful take on classics from Van Morrison and a ton of originals and Frank simply shreds on lead guitar.  Johnie kills on keyboards!  If you're lucky, there might be a few horns in the house!  These guys won't be around forever - do yourself a favor and go see them. And by the way - $6.25 for some excellent grilled and baked wings - what are you waiting for?  Owner George is a badass - super nice guy!  I guarantee you'll have a good time. If you don't - well - you're hopeless!"}
{"text":"My old neighborhood bar. The wings are the BEST in the world (Wednesday Wing Night!). Great selection of taps, the burgers are great, friendliest waitstaff in town, nice outdoor seating, and a sick jukebox. Agreed, it does look a little dodgy outside, but it is quite a classy place."}
{"text":"Excuses is our favorite place to meet up to watch the Penguins games when we're in town.  The food is great, the drinks are inexpensive, and the service is awesome!  There are TVs everywhere so you can catch the game no matter which way you're facing, and a juke box with awesome selections!  We've always had a good time here!"}
{"text":"THE hockey bar in the Burgh. Great food, good beer selection, and the best bartenders in town."}
{"text":"I find it pretty crazy that I got something i did not order and they still charge me for it. Bartender never offered to fix it. I guess that's the last time for me at excuses."}
{"text":"Love the wings!! And the daytime bartender is super sweet when we order take out so thank you :)"}
{"text":"First of all, this place is dirt cheap - nothing is really over $5 - I felt like it was the 90s again!  (Sigh....)   They have delicious sandwiches - BLTs, grilled cheese, hot turkey, pulled pork.  Each sandwich also comes with two sides, such as fries, mashed potatoes, cole slaw or mac 'n' cheese.  The sides are good, but nothing spectacular.  Still, the service is great and the price is right."}
{"text":"I selected one star just so that  I could write my review. My boyfriend and I went to Excuses after being referred by a employee of the nearby casino. Ugh!! Big mistake...we were greeted with an attitude like what are you doing here. I asked to see a menu and was told by the bartender that theirs nothing to see that she couldn't tell us lol hold up this is my first time here why am I being denied a menu regardless of the reason. I brushed it off then ordered 12 wings, and a tequila sunrise. She began to give us plates stating oh that'll be 30 seconds since I have some done left over. My boyfriend wasn't having it he politely said his goodbyes and we left. Bartender was completely rude. I never experienced something like this ever. I won't be back, too bad;("}
{"text":"It's a dive bar, they have good wings and drink specials.  Nothing spectacular about it.  Six packs to go are at a reasonable price.  I used to live around he corner from it, so I frequented it."}
{"text":"Good beer, dive bar selections, reasonable prices. Food until early evening. Great service. Cool south side location with parking and all.   A diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Let me start my saying that I really didn't give this place a fair shot.  We were in Pittsburgh for the weekend and were working our way down Carson Street, bar by bar.  This was our 1st stop.  We could only stay for 1 drink because we had a pregnant girl that was with us (not drinking), and the place allowed smoking.   We had just missed the live band, and didn't get to try any of the food, so I can't speak on behalf of either of those.    Place was a good size with plenty of room to move around.  The crowd there was mainly older (40s & 50s).   But with all the room, I was disappointed there was no pool table/dart board.     The men's bathroom didn't have a lock on the door and there was no divider between the toilet and the urinal.  This is a pet peeve of mine. Is it really that expensive to install a divider?  So if you go here, don't eat too many wings or you will need someone to stand guard as you use the bathroom.  Another small annoyance... On the way to the bar we picked up a few bottles of water to bring back to the hotel with us and they made us check in the water and leave it at the entrance.  What is that all about?  Overall, the place was a typical dive bar, nothing special about it.  With a dozen other bars to choose from on the same street, why go here?"}
{"text":"Smoking... Drinking...  Jukebox that plays when no one picks music....  Tons of beers on tap...  Bar food to take home...  What else can u ask for...???"}
{"text":"So I love a good dive bar, but as soon as I walked in I had to turn around. I got a horrible vibe from the bartenders and a bunch of patrons. We are from out of town and saw that this place had great reviews so we thought we'd give it a try. If the bartenders want to snicker and talk about my group of friends, then they just lost any tips we could have given them. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I love the more dive-y bars... and Excuses is definitely one indeed and this to me is a compliment to this fine establishment!  This neighborhood bar is definitely a little gem on the east end of Carson Street near Southside Works where things tend to be a little more quiet.    Great wings, nice variety of a crowd, Pens games, and Karaoke two times a week.  What more can I ask for?  One thing I will also say, the bartenders here are great.  Always prompt service and they do  not play the whole I am a girl, so I will wait on men first thing that I have seen quite a bit.  Fast service with a smile is always the case at Excuses."}
{"text":"To each their own and Excuses doesn't strike me as my kinda place. Saturday night they had live local bands playing that drew an \"alternative\" crowd... Everyone seemed to know each other and was either a girlfriend of someone in the band or girlfriend's friend. Two blonde girls were sitting in the middle of the place, rocking out but looking very out of place without black hair, dark clothes, tattoos and piercings.   The drinks, while cheap, were gross. I got a maker's sour but it tasted really really odd. Haven't tried their food, doubt I will."}
{"text":"I would call this place a great dive. It was everything that you would want in a dive bar. Good prices, good food, good service. We took an uber from the stadium area and it was well worth the trip. It was obviously a locals bar, but they welcomed us right away. If you are looking for something other than the touristy bars, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Excuses was a fun little dive bar. I don't recommend the food but the drinks are cheap and the outdoor patio is fab for just handing out and chatting with friends! The service is friendly and attentive!  Pros: Service, outdoor patio, cheap drinks Cons: Food (we had onion rings :p) the wings were ok-they were tender but the sauce was just meh."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd have a reason to go here, but what do you know, a friend and I found ourselves in this area of Southside and was looking for a place that might have cheap drinks.  We decided against going towards the Works b/c we knew that \"cheap\" isn't in their vocabulary when it comes to drinks.  So we gave ourselves an excuse to check out \"Excuses\"...get it - HA!    I'm sure at a divey bar like this, beer is probably the best option, well we decided to break all kinds of divey bar rules and ordered wine.  Surprise - it was good!  We had a few glasses of the Cabernet and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't \"spit it out of your mouth\" wine.    Needless to say a couple hours and a few glasses of wine later, we were Excuses fans!  It's small inside, but it works.  It sorta seems placed randomly in Southside, not necessarily near or next to several other bars, which is what you usually find in this area.    While I don't foresee myself making a special trip to this place, I'm glad I checked it out!"}
{"text":"Holy hell, what are yelpers thinking?  My friends and I are on a quest to find the best wings in the 'burgh (and when I say 'burgh, I mean the city... we ain't driving to Monroeville for any wings!) and upon googling \"best wings in Pittsburgh,\" Excuses came up as NUMBER TWO.  We thought we had struck gold (GOLD, Jerry, GOLD!).  We had struck nothing more than a horse apple (ref: Shawshank Redemption).  Admittedly, we messed up and showed up on Thursday (versus Wednesday) for wing night.  Our bad.  However, one would think that the wings served on Wednesday are the same as the wings served on Thursday.  If they ARE different, I'll happily try this place again.  Anyway, I walk into a cloud of smoke.  I hate to be a pain about this, but isn't there a law against cigarette smoke in an establishment that serves food (they even have a dining room!)?  This was my first turn off.  I guess I'm \"spoiled\" by having been able to eat in fresh air.  We claim a table in the back dining area and immediately start checking out the menus - which, btw, were placed neatly on each table.  The bartender comes up and tells us that they are on a \"late night\" menu (WHAT?  It was 7:20pm) and the menus we're looking at are basically just a tease.  OK.  I took a deep breath (coughed) and moved on.  \"So, do you have wings?\"  I ask. \"Oh yes, we have wings.\"  Says our server (also the bartender, and worth a mention, very nice and timely with drinks/etc.) PHEW \"But we only have one flavor.\" WHAT?!?  Normally this would be the third strike, but since the googles said they had the NUMBER TWO WINGS in Pittsburgh, we just figured they would be worth it.  So my group of five decides to tread cautiously and we get 2 dozen wings (hot wings, as that was the only flavor available).  FIVE SECONDS LATER the wings were there.  I'm not exaggerating.  There is quick, and then there is WAY TOO QUICK.  Basically, it was clear to us that these were wings from last night that were either nuked or had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while.  It gets worse.  They were good sized wings, but since they were \"leftovers\" all the fat was soft and chewy on the wings.  And inside, some of the meat was still pink.  This is a no-go with chicken.  I won't even go into detail on the brown, dried up celery...  The story ends with us not finishing the wings, heading over to Emiliano's across the street and having a grand ol' time with margaritas and nachos.  I will never, never, never go here again (unless I accidentally wander in inebriated for last call)."}
{"text":"Have only been here twice, once for a drink and once for food. Both times were great! It is just a little dive bar but a great atmosphere. We were told to go and try the food the second time so my boyfriend and I did. IT WAS AMAZING! One of the best burgers and gyros in the city. We both agreed that their gyro was better than Mike and Tonys! We will definitely be back to try more food. The bartender was so sweet and made great recommendations as well!"}
{"text":"Excuses isn't the type of place you go to for great food, great drinks, or to show off that new glitter dress you bought for your night at Diesel. It's the little dive bar you simply go to for a good time!  Aside from the average food, and smokiness (yes, smoking is permitted), I've never had a bad experience at Excuses. There's often a live band playing, a Pens game on the TV, or some awesomely bad karaoke going down. If you stop in between those \"events\", a solid draft selection and friendly staff will still be there waiting for you.  Now, if I was rating Excuses for it's food alone, it would get three stars. It's average grub, but it's so affordable that if you're expecting something better, your greedy ass deserves to be lathered in hot sauce and licked clean by the dude that runs karaoke...after he works up an appetite from singing his latest Guns N' Roses tune.  Go for the fun times and positive vibe, and when you wake up the next morning smelling like you've been smoking for 25 years, you can reminisce about whatever nonsense you got into the night before at Excuses. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went with my parents and a friend while I was in town (09/30/10). My brothers later showed up (they were out bachelor partying it up!). It was a Thursday night so it was pretty slow but I liked it. The bartender, I want to say her name was Katie (maybe?), was great. I told her I wanted some girlie drinks and she sure hooked me up! 6 drinks later I was pretty toasted but I had a blast. It was really cheap too so I'm sure I'll be hitting this place up the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because Yelp had some good reviews. Nothing special here. Heard a lot about karaoke here but there was no signage about it in the bar. Somewhat cheap drinks but my beer I get back home in a bottle for $5 I got for almost $7 here. Bartender was in a sweatshirt and barely talked to us. Late night menu had 5 items. We left after 1 drink."}
{"text":"Dive bar in all the great ways.  Saturday night is an open stage hosted by the Aces, a well-known and talented set of blues musicians.  Long history with blues music; local musician hang out.  Small, crowded, funky layout -but- great service, nice range of beers, average bar food."}
{"text":"You want to go to the best bar in Pittsburgh, come here, cut and dried. It ain't one of them fancy pantsy Barbie hangs here lemme show off my bling and impress the idiots hangouts. This is a down home, gritty, great local music, beer selection to die for, well poured drinks, wings that will knock yer socks jagoff, smoke 'em if you got 'em frickin' Pittsburgh BAR! You never know who's gonna pop in - Lange from the Penguins, a Steeler or two, or the Pirate Parrot...but everyone is treated the same, the regulars will warm up to you and treat you like family as long as you're not a tool...and after a time or two, you will not want to wet your whistle anyplace else. This is the best bar in Pittsburgh, bar none!"}
{"text":"Pretty good neighborhood bar! Even at 10am on a Sunday morning! Great wings, and good wraps. They have live music on the weekends...something that's going away at most places."}
{"text":"Don't be looking for anything fancy, this is an old school neighborhood 80's bar with many locals. But those who aren't locals are welcomed. A lot of people call it a \"dive bar\", but it's a laid back non-hipster place to drink, get delicious & CHEAP food & hear great live local bands like the Aces who play there basically every Saturday from 4-8pm (blues, rnb, rock, originals & covers). Cover is usually $7 or less for bands & there are some great local acts besides the Aces who fill the 9-12am slot such as Bill Toms & Hard Rain. Bands play in the back & there are limited tables in the back for dining. They have THE best & cheapest wings which are baked not fried. Their cheeseburger is fresh off the grill in the back & comes with 2 sides for under $7. They serve full dinners as well, but kitchen closes about 8 I think & then the late night menu has wings, gyros, hot dogs etc. They have a lot of craft beers on tap. Their bartender/server is amazing & efficient during shows, when the place is packed, I don't know how she does it. It's right on the corner of Carson & 25th so you can't miss it. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've always wandered about Excuses as I drive by in my car on E Carson and finally had a chance to go this past weekend. Stopped by to meet up with some friends for some afternoon drinks. The venue is cozy and totally empty except for a few locals. Totally a local dive bar and the drinks are cheap which at that point you've got me sold. A nice low key casual place to throw back a few. The food I'm not so sure about and once it hit about 7pm the place started to get packed."}
{"text":"I've been going to Excuses for years as many of my friends with bands have played there. Some have called it a dive bar and I hesitate to do so. To me it's more of an old school neighborhood bar where regulars, sports fans and rockers gather for music, drinks, food and fun. They have a good bar menu. I swear the fries are some of the best I've had. Nothing fancy just fried perfectly. Like crack they are. It can get pretty busy but the staff are attentive and friendly. The owner George is always nice and happy to see patrons even if it's been awhile. He takes the time for hugs and chit chat."}
