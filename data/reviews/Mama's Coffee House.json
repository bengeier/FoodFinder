{"text":"This place is amazing! This is our first time here and I have to say... Great service, great drinks and yummy cinnamon sugar donuts. The moment we walked in felt like we went to another city! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Mama's since they opened. Wonderful service, coffee blends and pastries. Even met my Soulmate here 2.22.14"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the mornings on a weekday. Don't know about the weekends, but I've had quick and friendly service. There is a TON of different drawings/writings on the ceiling and walls. Not distracting. I liked skimming over them at times, but they didn't bother me when I was actually working.  The breakfast panini was very filling and tasty (best when it's still warm/hot). The drinks haven't wowed me, but they were pretty good. I LOVED that they have various 90s music playing in the background.  The seating area is good - some open spaces and some a little more private and tucked away. There are wooden tables & chairs, stools, and a few couches & armchairs. There is also outdoor seating.   POKESTOP here! Easy to sit inside and stock up on pokeballs, etc."}
{"text":"Delicious espresso, latte and breakfast sandwiches and in such a cute and unique environment. We loved penning our visit on the wall; felt a little like carving our initials in a tree. We were here!"}
{"text":"The best spiced chai i've ever had!  Sandwiches are really good as well and the service is great. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great place to kick back and enjoy some excellent coffee and a bite to eat.  Nice people work there and go there so it's fun to hang out on one of the sofas and meet locals."}
{"text":"I can't count how many times I'd driven by Mama's Coffee House and commented that I wanted to stop in sometime.. well I finally stood by my word! And so glad I did!! It's welcoming, eclectic, cool. Stopped in on a sunday morning and immediately was oh so happy that I did... Decided I would come back to hang out even before ordering once I saw the comfy couches.. we ordered an iced latte and a turtle mocha latte... was not disappointed and will be back for more! Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"Adorable place! Great service and food.  I met my friend for breakfast and was very pleased!"}
{"text":"Full of character! Artsy. Comfy. You are invited to draw/write on the walls. The coffee and food are great. The service is the warm and friendly. Your neighborhood go to place. Our favorite!"}
{"text":"Enjoying this place right now as I eat a delicious panini (very reasonably priced) and a great cup of coffee. I know the coffee is good when I can drink it black, and it's spot-on here. Cool interior, friendly staff and fast wi-fi. Can't ask for anything more than that."}
{"text":"Worth a wait for your morning wakeup brew. Skip the chains and support the local thing."}
{"text":"Great hideout! Doesn't look like much from the outside but it's a hidden gem. There's writings all over the wall so grab some coffee and pen inspirations while you're at it.  Parking is tight so they are normally jam packed during the weekend!"}
{"text":"Coffee is great but when I started going there, always getting large coffee and getting my card stamped, every morning, I was kind of shocked when I handed my card over and instead of a free coffee I got the owner that spent sometime working out the difference from a small coffee to a large.  I had a friend that owned a coffee place so I know the profit on coffee and come on, seriously, if you value your customers loyalty, pay back a large with a large free!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much everything you hope for in a independent coffee shop... The baristas are knowledgable, well-trained and laid back. The atmosphere is casual and quiet, with eclectic and brightly colored decorations and hand written graffiti literately everywhere! Coffee isn't cheap though and be kind, tip your barista!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop. Kids (and adults) can write everywhere with markers. Very cozy inside. Nice bakery selection and sandwiches. Games for the kids. Good conversation spots for adults. And I haven't even gotten to the coffee. YUM! Good selection of coffee/espresso drinks. All for a great price!"}
{"text":"Barista was so friendly! great customer service. I really liked my papa's panini with added tomato. and the cilantro dip with it was sooooo good. Never had anything like it. If it wasnt so far i would come all the time :/ oh and i like my coffee black but usually its really bitter wherever i get it, which tells me its not really good coffee but theirs was so light and smooth. No bitterness at all :) enjoyed my time there"}
{"text":"Look up...look down... bc you haven't had your coffee yet and are very easily amused when your face refuses expression.  Large mocha is delivered to your table and you feel like you're finally going to wake up.    This iced mocha is the BEST i have ever had! And I have had a lot of them. Usually burnt flavored, too much syrup crap that I ignore just to get through my day. But this... reminds me of the stove brewed nutty espresso that my Nona used to serve us. The breakfast bagel is on its way, and I can't imagine how much better they can make it, but will write a review on my next visit.    Thank you Mama's, for doing it right!"}
{"text":"Very nice little place in the middle of no place. I had a sandwich with my wife for 5.99 and it was enough for the two of us and it was good too.  Def give it a try."}
{"text":"It's a cute little place and they have comfy seating everywhere. I come here for coffee and bagels. Not bad for nc. New York wins though."}
{"text":"This eclectic coffee shop is just outside of downtown Pineville.  It offers a lot of indoor and outdoor work/social space."}
{"text":"You ever wonder where you can get a frapp√© year round?  Well go to Mama's!  Cute little house.  It's a little bit out of the way - but if I needed to bunker down for a few hours and actually work, I could easily see myself hanging out here.  Friendly people, great food, sweets and savory..  Great coffee.  Nice surprise!!"}
{"text":"This is the coolest, neatest, lil spot to visit. The owner is normally there baking yummy deserts. If you go there during the winter, you can enjoy a bonfire while sipping on your coffee. Its definitely kid friendly. They even let you draw or write on the walls! Overall it's a good time and everything on the menu is Great!!"}
{"text":"Mama is a wonderful lady.  She has the best personality. And she has great coffee!!    The shop is very artsy. Writing all over the walls which is so sweet. I even got to write on the wall. Tons of room. Great place for a meeting or just to have a nice quiet cup of coffee. Lovely outside seating. A true gem of a place out of the hustle and bustle of the city."}
{"text":"This place is great! I had Mama's panini, a vanilla latte, and a slice of carrot cake (which in retrospect I probably shouldn't have gotten, but the barista said it was the best carrot cake he'd ever had, and he didn't lie!). Everything was great. Good food, yummy latte, excellent cake. Excellent service--they forgot to bring my latte but immediately gave me a larger size to make up for their mistake. Love the environment, and love that they make you feel at home by giving you a marker to add your signature or bit of wisdom to the walls/ceiling/floors. Makes me wish I were local so I could come back for more!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The dirty chai is amazing. Rich and creamy. We have tried breakfast croissants and paninis. Everything has been delicious. The salsa served on the side is LIFE CHANGING. So good! We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Too much noise - not a quite coffee shop! I live on the road and am always looking for a home away from home office to work from for a few hours. I love Mama's in the summer because the patio is great to work from... The coffee shop itself it a bit too loud for me when I'm trying to get work done. They are very noisy when they're cleaning the shop (garbage, cleaning tables and mopping). There's a lot of unnecessary noise of banging chairs. The after 2pm crowd is all people on their laptops and I feel like they're trying to get us to leave so they can close.  I'll keep coming back because it's an only option, but I wish they were more focused on creating a peaceful and welcoming environment."}
{"text":"So homely inside. Love this place. I had the chocolate cupcake not sweety-sweet which is the way I like."}
{"text":"This is just the cutest place ever!!! Their coffee is great! The food they have is also very amazing. It was a very nice experience. The place is very clean as well. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The owner is attentive and helpful. We have planned a shower there for March."}
{"text":"Great service! Everything was delicious and I tried a little bit of everything. I drink Americanos black normally and I was happy with it. The house blend coffee is pretty good as well.   I enjoyed reading all of the writing on the walls, but it took three drinks to decide what I wanted to contribute.   I would easily come back."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop in Pineville with a great feel and vibe. Awesome customer service. Very attentive."}
{"text":"Bacon, egg, and cheese bagel was quite good and my mocha latte was enjoyable as well. Those two things cost me $10.50. Came as kind of a shock when she added them up and I had to put the 10 back in my wallet and get out a 20. Good food and coffee but more expensive than Starbucks."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great coffee made exactly how we wanted it and friendly staff. My husband likes his lattes a little cooler than normal so he can drink it right away and the barista nailed it. The little girls who help out are so friendly and personable, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! If you want good coffee and an authentic friendly vibe, this is the place to go. The family that is currently running it makes you feel right at home. Not to mention the food and sweets are a great price and taste! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The Atmosphere is Great! It is a quaint little coffee shop and very clean. The Price for specialty drinks are too high unfortunately for the size cup you get and the quality not as good as Starbucks. I like to support Mom and Pop businesses though so I will go there again. Isn't my favorite coffee place though."}
{"text":"Homemade tres leches cupcakes, Homemade flan, Homemade Banana Bread,  and best of all... Homemade cilantro based salsa!!! The powder based chai  lattes (spiced, vanilla, and green tea) are amazing:) The corn chips n salsa are gluten free friendly... per a recent gluten free customer! The Panini's are all very delicious and the breakfast sandwiches are yummy too!!! Lots of other drink and pastry choices... plus you can write all over the place with a Sharpie?!?! Very fun :) Mama is the sweetest and if you stick around, you can practice your Espa√±ol!!!! Family and group friendly.  Inside/outside seating... oh yes, beer and wine too!!!! Boardgames,  books, coins glued to the counter and floor... not to mention writing on all the doors?!?! Beans roasted locally in Noda by the Boquete  Mountain Coffee Roasters. And yes... free WiFi and bring your debit & credit cards...they will happily accept those or cash payment."}
{"text":"It was never anything special. We waited like 15-20 mins for a bagel with ready to serve egg and cheese. The coffee and espresso was just ok. Was there one weekend, lots of people there and two guys working it, went back the next weekend and closed. Would have been nice to have a heads up the week before that, \"hey, we're closing in less than a week\" considering it is like a 15 mile drive for me. Found that rapid closure with no hint strange."}
{"text":"I only wish there were more places like this. I love the eclectic artsy coffee house appeal with fantastic staff and they will let me ask a million (and I kinda mean it) questions to figure what I want to try. Seriously great company, wonderful atmosphere and fantastic drinks. So happy to have found this place and already have been Twice this week :)"}
{"text":"Hola!  We walked in and the Lady behind the counter was speaking Spanish!  Immediately I'm having visions of enjoying a Cuban Espresso!  Dreams come to life!    Poprock Love and I had lunch today and were driving back to Charlotte when I mentioned Mama's Coffee House in Pineville!  Neither of us had been and when she said \"let's go\" I needed no further encouragement!  Poprock ordered a delicious Blended Iced Coffee - I know so little about ordering Caffeinated Beverages, so I enjoy when someone knows what to get!  The Lemon (something) Cake was good too and having a bite of the Iced Coffee, a bite of Cake and a bit of Cuban Espresso, yum!  The flavors complimented each other very well!  This is a COMFORTABLE place!  A Coffee House in a House!  You'll see!  I'm betting you could either: get work done here or meet someone and get nothing done, which ever you chose!  The Front yard has a shady tree and tables.  The inside has Rooms so you could meet with a small group or sit by yourself and be productive or relax, maybe a little of both!"}
{"text":"from the outer exterior I didn't expect much, but to my surprise I was definitely blown away with the serve, coffee and chill interior! 5 stars across the board!   Btw the mama grilled sandwich is amazing! A+++  Dylan"}
{"text":"Mama's Mama's Mama's.. that little coffee house in the corner of some middle of nowhere! it's like a hidden treasure where happiness is buried!   Been driving past this coffee house for almost a year, never paying attention until 1 day on a depressed emotional mood, I decided try the place!   When you walk in, it's like a little house.  It has the perfect ambiance, the quietness you need when you need to study, read, or simply hang out!   The menu is quite descent, nothing special, nothing too overwhelming. Paninis, Breakfast Sandwich, dessert.. and of course coffee!!  Coffee is awesome! with awesome blend, depends on what you prefer!  Nevertheless! it is a jewel in the middle of nowhere!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best little coffee shop around! Love the staff, the coffee, the atmosphere. Wish I lived closer so I could go more often."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place! First of all they allow you to pre purchase pending coffee for people in need and I'll continue to be a patron because of that PLUS it's the only place around that I've found that does this. The menu is not large but what I had was fabulous! The people are terrific and welcoming. I met a nice couple moving into the area and we chatted for most of the time I was there. The people who work there are helpful and simply lovely. I highly recommend Mama's!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee & espresso with great service! One of my favorite spots since moving to the south."}
{"text":"Great place! Got a delicious soy mocha and blueberry muffin. Very welcoming place....guests are invited to write on the walls so it was fun to read what other people had written. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love it love it love it! I had chocolate coffee frape. The decor is amazing. Service is nice and friendly. Clean environment."}
{"text":"Awesome little coffee house! I came to visit the area and needed a pick-me-up in the morning and this was the perfect spot. The coffee was great and their breakfast croissants are amazing!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place, I arrived at 1p with groceries in my car. The intentions to go in, have a coffee journal a little and head home. NOPE!!! Four hours later the owner came by and said were about to close . Where did the time go??? Thankfully it was 20¬∞ outside so my groceries did not spoil in the car lol. With that being said... ILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Their coffee is delicious.  Their espresso is done right, the employees are positive, helpful, and knowledgeable.  The general energy of the place is casual, fun, upbeat and artistic.  I love it here, it's the perfect coffee spot."}
{"text":"NEW DISCOVERY! As I travel up and down Hwy 51 in Pineville every day, I have been watching a little coffee house come into existence. Mama's Coffee House is finally open and I stopped by today to check it out. What I found was a friendly owner, Ellie and a comfortable, nicely decorated cafe. Ellie offers very nice coffee drinks (using fresh roasted beans delivered weekly) and pastries. In addition, the menu includes sandwiches, soup, beer and wine.  Mama's is a great location for meetings - being close to the Arrowood commercial district, it would make a pleasant spot for a morning meeting or lunch meeting.  Mama's has hereby been put on my \"regular\" list. Come join me sometime!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that this small shop with what is clearly a family run outfit (and they are righteously proud of what they do) would turn and everyday \"let's try some place different\" into a \"I feel like we're on a vacation in the country with some of the nicest folks making sure that we were treated like family (they all are busy working away, including some very diligent young ladies (under 10) who take their jobs very seriously. There was a nice wine list (and craft brew no doubt), but the hubbie went for one of their yummie smoothies. We were greeted and treated like family. . .only a 15 minute ride from where we live in Charlotte and felt like we were taking a vacation in the country. A very interesting place, cool art everywhere and might I add that as huge fans of Panini's, theirs were just the best we've had. Aside from interesting mixes of flavors, the bread was crisp, sandwiches appropriately warm and just plain delicious! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for funky, local coffee shops to get my mid day fix. Used my trusty Yelp app - of course - to find this place as I was in the area. I instantly loved the look of the place with the artfully decorated doors in the front yard. It just has a funky  vibe that I love. I ordered the caramel macchiato with 2% milk - tasted bland, almost watered down.  I wanted almond milk but they were out (curiously another reviewer said the same about them being out of supplies :-(  The employees were nice and pleasant but please make sure to keep your ingredients on hand and do something to punch up the flavor of the caramel macchiato. I'll have to come back to try the other flavors."}
{"text":"First time here and the first impression was fantastic!   Let's start with the staff. Absolutely welcoming and friendly and genuine. I had just met Manuel and Diego and I felt like I had known them all my life. I like pour-over coffee which they do not serve here and they were willing to try to do one for me even though they had never heard of such a thing. Well, they found a funnel and found a big filter, ground up some coffee and used a cup to pour the hot water into the filter and WOW did it come out great! They also have a wide selection of lattes and frappes as well as brewed coffee. There is a small menu of paninis and a terrific selection of baked goods from Las Delicias bakery (http://www.lasdeliciasbakeryclt.com/#!bakery/c1se). I had a slice of passion fruit cake and it was AWESOME!   Lots of inside seating  with lots of cool nooks and a great variety of furniture from tabletops to couches to lounge chairs. Great art on the wall AND for anyone who is new to the place, they ask that you write something on the wall, ceiling, or floor with a big black marker that they give you!! Very cool to see and very cool to read! Great piped in music too! It was a jazz selection when I was there.  Plenty of outside seating with a view of wonderful \"door art\". You'd have to see it to know what I'm talking about. Plenty of parking too!   I am smitten with this place and will be thinking of it until my return!  On a side note, I don't usually speak about other reviews on Yelp, but the person who said that there was \"too much noise\" here is being unreasonable. First of all, it's not a funeral parlor nor is it a library so complaining that they are making too much noise while you \"are trying to get work done\" is really unfair. Yet,  you'll work out on the patio where the traffic out front is pretty much non-stop? Come on."}
{"text":"Great coffee environment! I'm not a huge coffee person but the guys helped me find something I might like and it was great!! Highly recommend the iced latte!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly, muffins were really dry but the decor is what turned me off. There is magic marker on everything and anything in this place including the walls. I was so over stimulated it was crazy. I didn't want to sit down since I had light colored pants on and was worried he marker would rub off on them. This would not be a place I'd come to work or relax."}
{"text":"Welp I've been here several times.....I work near by.  Great location, there's always parking. I love the Croissant Bacon, Egg & Cheese Sandwich, it comes with a cilantro salsa.....AMAZING ON THE SANDWICH....of course I visited this morning. This is one of my absolute favorite places in Pineville!!!  I haven't purchased any beverages besides water....maybe that will be my next purchase. I hope they have Hot Cider, I don't drink coffee. I'm not a fan of the pastries sitting out....they look DELISH!!!!! However, I dislike the sitting out part.   The staff is great. Really nice people....i've never had any problems. You'll notice the writings on the walls, floor, doorknobs, and more! Reminds me of a restaurant in Chicago called \"Ginos East\". Beware off the Lunch crowd. Can get a little busy."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home from Pineville and was happy I finally did. The shop is fun and eclectic. When entering you are greeted by a graffiti filled door which leads into the coffee shop which is also loaded with graffiti written walls. It is obvious that at Mama's Coffee Shop you can truly express yourself; hence the graffiti filled walls. I ordered a cappuccino and was told by a friendly gentleman behind the counter \"you came to the right place because I make one hell of a cappuccino\". He was correct! I am enjoying my cappuccino while writing this and look forward to coming back and enjoying another. Support your local establishments and grab a cup of coffee from Mama's. It is worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolute Gem!!  Wife and I stopped Thursday afternoon and were \"waited upon\" at the counter by Mama and the wonderful, darling Paige,  What a sweetheart at age 7!! An she is the ultimate \"smartie pants\" with a smile that melts.  We ordered two paninis (the spicy and the chicken pesto) and have to say that while we live just behind and can walk five minutes to Ballantyne Village and can get some great paninis at almost everyplace there, Mama's puts them all to shame.  Great place,fantastic family run operation and they all seem to really love what they do and making customers feel like family as well.  DEFINITELY will be back.  In fact Paige asked us if we would be back tomorrow and when we told her it was supposed to rain, her without a thought answer was \"Well, that's what THEY predicted, but you know THEM!!  What a little genius and funny as a hoot!! Paige alone is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am giving them 3 stars instead of 2 based entirely on what my coworkers tell me they are actually like. I'd like to give them the lower rating because I am unimpressed! That said, I will certainly coming back a time or two or ten for them to have plenty of chances to redeem themselves. Allow me to explain...  Friday is \"go out to lunch\" day. I went with my new coworkers to Mama's because they highly recommended it. Outside I thought \"okay, cool little kitschy coffee shop for the hipsters\". Once inside that sentiment is confirmed...though I'd say it's a little more hippie than hipster. Reminds me of a vagabond friend of mind in a lot of ways. There's a splay of words written on the walls every where that is within reach and even where it's not within reach. It was lunch time on a Friday and I found it to be strangely dead. Only one patron sat under the TV engrossed in his computer screen, milking his coffee and their free wi-fi.  At the counter you will find that they have a number of board on the wall with food and drinks made to order. Emphasis on the made to order. There are lots of panini options and even quesadillas. Pretty good (and quirky) variety. They have frappuccinos (which I think is a Starbucks trademark so maybe that's misrepresenting), coffee and tea - what you'd expect. They also have a point card: ten punches and you get a freebie. No punches for food which had me feeling lame because I wanted to be one of the cool kids.  All that's the good stuff. Four of us ordered food. Instantly we heard that they didn't have the usual bread for the paninis. No biggie - brioche, ciabatta, etc. as long as you flatten and crisp it I'm okay. A lucky one of us four got their last tortillas for a quesadilla...starting to get a little ridic...gotta have the stuff to make your food y'all! They others grabbed their coffee - I grabbed my water - and we sat down to wait. And wait we did...perhaps 5 minutes before some new person that didn't look like he even worked there came to tell two of us that they don't have turkey for the paninis. He asked if we wanted ham or roast beef. Fine...I took roast beef. This is now just annoying. We waited again...probably 20 minutes. (I want to remind you we were the only people there.) It was a bit outrageous...  Waiting aside, the food was good and the place has a neat feel to it. Reminds me a little of Amelie's. And of course I'll be back to give 'em another looksee for lunch."}
{"text":"Mama and family invite you to leave your mark across the walls, floors and ceilings while they create your coffee concoction of choice. You also have the option of a fresh made bakery item to munch on with your joe.  Don't be mistaken, they definitely know how to pack a punch on lunch with their homemade-to-order flavorful panini's and wraps! Beer and wine options are also available, which will come in handy during their late night music and dancing events.  The quaint little coffee house that Pineville has needed for quite some time! The friendly, smiling staff awaits your visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing expresso and we love it here :) Great place to do work and charge your phone!!! Hugs and much love!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee house. The atmosphere will stimulate the creative side. She'll even have you write on the walls."}
{"text":"Not really sure where to start. Probably by saying contrary to the other reviews, this is not in the middle of nowhere. Chill. It's downtown Pineville of all places. Pretty sure Pineville is not no mans land.  Back when I drove an ambulance we would pass by here regularly on the way to the hospital and I thought \"I wonder...\"  I am SO GLAD I went in one day!  The coffee was delectable. I haven't used that word to describe anything in years.  The cake slice....lord there are not enough words in the English language. Nom. Just nom!  The walls were adorable to read- right at our table was where a young man had just proposed to his girlfriend. A sign for our future? Maybe. I was even more delighted when the owner- Mama, of course duh- said that if we write anything she ask that it \"stay G rated\".   Finally, a family friendly establishment. I love your shop, Mama!"}
{"text":"The decor was awesome.. Intriguing blend of coffee shop couture and graffiti. I liked that.   However, this was the only good thing.  The owner didn't know how to use his POS system and had to ask me my order twice.  Medium cappuccino with a  plain croissant.  He told me they were out of regular croissants but had  the whole wheat variety. I said sure. I'll live dangerously and try one.  He then told me no need to pay yet that he will bring me my food and to pay then.  I waited 10 mins.. No food. Until the single worker there asked me if I'd ordered something. Apparently he had taken my cappuccino to another table and they had accepted it even though they had not ordered it.  No worry, I didn't pay for it. Ha ha.  So finally the order comes.  Good croissant with cream cheese on it.  Even though I'd asked for it plain.  It was still good and I enjoyed it.  Cappuccino was mediocre at best and could probably be re produced by an entry level barista at Starbucks."}
{"text":"love the building but when it came to ordering, it seemed like they just did not have anything in stock they were out of everything. very bad first impression but will try it one more time to see if it will be better."}
{"text":"What a fun little place! I can imagine kids would like it because he can draw everywhere and anywhere.  They have a decent menu with sandwiches, pennies, coffees, and other treats.  The staff was nice and active, walking around and checking in on customers. I had a wonderful breakfast, thank you!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a cup of coffee and getting work done. I come here in the afternoons when I need a get-away. As a remote employee for a non-profit ministry this is one of my second offices in the Charlotte area. I love all of their drinks, and if you are a regular like me, they'll know you personally. Good vibes and great music."}
{"text":"Great!!! Such a precious gem in Pineville!! Great coffee, amazing owner and lots of parking! I didn't eat any of their food items however they looked amazing! It's a really neat spot that can accommodate groups which I know can be hard to find in a coffee shop! Excited to take my husband back for a coffee date!"}
{"text":"Looove this coffee house. It's adorable even all the writing on the walls! The food was DELICIOUS! We always order all kinds of sandwiches and they always come out fresh and yummy! Oh the bakery and coffee are also on top of my list. Great owner and great service. I highly recommend this joint for a delicious fun ambiance!"}
{"text":"Bright and sunny little coffee shop with the best cappuccino I've ever had. Perfect amount of espresso with creamy foam. Eclectic and adorable layout. Make sure to sign your name!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this coffeehouse. First of all, it's an actual coffee \"house\", which is adorable. Their coffee is excellent and so is their loose leaf tea. I tried the spicy smoky panini and that was delicious too. The owner even came around and offered is samples of empanadas. The staff is friendly and willing to help you decide on which coffee to get. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"This place has highest level of service and strong flavor coffee. Excellent hot whole milk in the coffee a big plus. I went to order Guava & Cream Cheese \"Guayaba con Queso\" and omg what a surprise the best i ever had, i had try this thing in a 100 different restaurants"}
{"text":"¬°Despertemos y gocemos con el aroma del caf√©! (Wake up and smell the coffee!)  Mama's coffee is the epitome of a local coffee shop. An awesome place tucked away just outside of downtown Pineville. The signatures and words of wisdom from ceiling to floor left behind by customers gives this place a sense of belong to everyone who steps through the door. I default to vanilla lattes with an occasional decadent dessert made by their sister bakery. I love coming to this place. The outside patio is perfectly situated to admire the artwork doors out front or take a stroll out back for a little shopping at their accessory shop."}
{"text":"I've driven past this joint any number of times, usually on my way to the Waldhorn and in no mood for coffee. But it's been bookmarked for a long while and I was feeling caffeine deprived and here we are.  Funky vibe with graffiti all over the walls and furniture. Lots of mismatched furniture but plenty of spots to sit and do the Internet while you suck down some very tasty joe. I had a hazelnut latte and it was perfect. Strong coffee underneath but very tasty. There were some delicious looking pastries under the glass, plus they do sandwiches and pannins (and even some bottled beers??) but this was only a coffee stop today.  Internet worked well, seats were comfy and the coffee rejuvenated me. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Best coffee and awesome Panini Breakfast and Cilantro! Luv the art! While  Most people that I've asked about this little piece of heaven have past it a million times but have never stopped.  Those that have been rant, rave and are addicted to the persona of this converted house.   When in Pineville it's a must"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet you need to go soon!   A hot minute from Pineville mainstreet and the coffee, sandwiches, pastries, etc., are fantastic.  Great place to meet friends or enjoy solo and the staff is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I did come back. Service great. I'm glad to see the cafe is still going strong despite some hardships. Hopefully the cafe will continue to improve."}
{"text":"I went in on a day of serendipity. Loved the crew who works at Mama's and felt comfortable enough to stay for a few hours to enjoy people, the delicious coffee and chai, as well as the ambiance of this place. I live further away but I know I'll return at some point. Thank you for the lovely and wonderful experience."}
