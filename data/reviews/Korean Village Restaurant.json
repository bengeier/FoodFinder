{"text":"My meal was so terrible that I am writing this review instead of eating my food. I wish I could tell somebody but I haven't seen a server since one dropped off the food and left. This is literally the worst meal I've had in Calgary. Do not come here.

I came back to edit this review because I can't get over how bad this meal was. The kimchi was terrible, the bulgogi tasted like nothing. The best part of the meal was the hot sauce that I used to provide some semblance of flavour."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey, but delivers on par korean food. I had dolsot bibimbap and pajeon. The bbb was okay, but the red pepper paste was missing something. The pajeon portion is probably meant for four people so I took that home. It was tasty, a little doughy compared to traditional pajeon. All in all satisfactory, as the ambiance and booths provide a lot of privacy and that's a bonus for a hot date!"}
{"text":"One of the best in Koreatown due to variety of their menu - there is something for everyone.   Flavor is always intense, great sides dishes (the best kimchi on bloor - most days!), efficient service and all around great experience.  I like the fact that they have so many booths and a few private rooms so you can catch up with friends and not feel crammed like so many places in ktown.

Highly recommend to anyone who is new to trying Korean cuisine and want to \"ease\" into it with the bibimbap (mixed veg/rice/beef in hot stone bowl with spicy red sauce)  or kalbi (short -rib) as they prepare it extremely well.

Although the aesthetics of the place could be improved (some modern updates)  -it's worth it to come back for the authentic Korean and all the variety this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Really like this place.   The lowdown:

Pros:
-Good for kids (highchairs and big, spacious booths)
-Large, varied menu (all the Korean favourites and a sushi menu too)
-You ring a bell at the table for service, which is really common in restaurants in South Korea and I LOVE it.  So efficient.  But even besides this, service is fast and friendly.
- tasty food!  the sushi was really good too, very fresh.
- they are clear about what is vegetarian and what isn't.  For example, kimchi stew is labelled as being in beef broth, so you know that even if you get it without meat, it's not veg.
-side dishes were good.  

Cons:
-pretty limited for vegetarian options, but most korean restaurants are.  You can always go for the hot stone pot bibimbap, which is AMAZING here.
- a bit more expensive than your average Korean joint, but it is nicer in terms of atmosphere and seating.  It's not cafeteria style like many other Korean places in the Bathurst/Bloor strip.  

I will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"By far the WORST Korean restaurant I've ever been (whether it's in GTA, NYC, or HK...)
- I'm Asian and I know what authentic Korean food taste like, the food here has NO taste whatsoever, we had to pour salt and hot paste just to make them edible.
- Expensive. You can get much better Korean food in Markham with prob 20% less the price here.
- Poor service. You ring the bell three times, wave everywhere and no one seems to (or pretend not to) have noticed you. 
I wish I could give this place a zero star, that's how bad this place is. If you are not Asian and just wanted to go to a \"so-called\" Korean restaurant and get ripped off then def go for it."}
{"text":"We entered by accident, but will come back by design. 

The food and the service were both excellent. Our server was the owners' son and he clearly had great respect for both his parents, their work and their restaurant. He gave us excellent menu advice, and was able to help me, the near-vegan to navigate ordering and eating without so much as a splash of fish sauce.

The Ban chan (Korean appetizers of assorted pickled vegetables) were great. When our server noticed that we had eaten one more quickly than the others, he brought us another plate. 

I had a vegetatrian Be-bim-bop, with tofu instead of beef and extra vegis instead of egg in a stone bowl (get the stone bowl, it's so worth the extra). Things were fresh, tasty and well seasoned.

While I am not usually a fan of restaurants with only one vegetarian option, this one is so good I predict that I will be back again and again. Heck, I'd go back for the ban chan alone."}
{"text":"When you walk into Korean Village you will be quickly greeted by their friendly staff. The restaurant is roomy with a nice atmosphere and has large comfy booth seatings - my fave! The menu is extensive with many options from platters to BBQs and the usual Korean dishes (pork bone soup, bibimbap etc.). 
My partner and I ended up sharing the assorted Grilling BBQ Platter (pork, beef, chicken, seafood). The selection of meat was not bad but just a bit over-marinated in sauce which made eating it quite salty. Prices in comparison to their serving portions are not very filling but other than that, the service is excellent as the waitress was helpful in coming back and forth to check on our cooking meats. 
Overall, fun experience with attentive staff that really want you to enjoy your time there.         
Note: take notice of the many pictures of celebrities and newspaper articles on their wall that have eaten here."}
{"text":"Lovely Staff and prompt service. I've been a loyal customer to this restaurant for many yeas and their quality of food has never disappointed me. Yuk jae jang is the best I've had here than anywhere else!"}
{"text":"BEWARE paying with credit! - credit card fraud (billed twice, which they denied), but food and service were great

I went on valentines day with my wife. The food and service were great. However, they billed my credit card twice and then refused to correct the second charge - after hours on hold with me credit card company they resolved the issue, but unfortunately Ono and restaurant were obstructionist and dismissive. Especially surprising because we visit often - no more."}
{"text":"Really, really like this place.
Go for the great [and amazingly cheap] lunch special items. 
Service was extremely friendly-bori cha, sliced oranges, side dishes and korean candies came with our meal and were all on the house. I usually only expect free side dishes at most korean joints."}
{"text":"Awesome korean good and great service. In my opinion the best stone bowls in the city. Kimchi is superb as well. One my favourites! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and they pay attention to the quality of the food (especially the meat). 
The owner makes the experience unique by explaining the dishes and anecdotes."}
{"text":"Agreeing with many of the other yelpers - this joint is definitely one of the best restaurants in Koreatown. I am a regular customer and never have I once had a bad dish or time there. Whether it is their tofu stew, bulgogi, short ribs or bibambap - it's always so delicious! 

I really like their fried pork dumplings for an appetizer. But I'm sure any of the apps would still be great. One great thing about this restaurant is that you could tell the servers that you don't like a dish and the manager will make sure you get something better. Although I assure you that you most likely will enjoy everything if you get if you like authentic Korean food.

I love the service so much here that I will wait if there are no tables available. The business is owned by a lovely family and the son is really exceptional when it comes to pleasing customers. Although it's categorized as Korean, I feel like this place is also comfort food. Having a rough day? Go there, feast and have a cold Sapporo. Surely a great fix to any weekday worry.

Reasonably priced, delicious and always a good experience. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Was looking to try some Korean BBQ and after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, we decided to give this place a try.  Our order consisted of the La Kal Bi (Marinated Korean Bone In Beef Ribs), Kal Bi (Marinated Korean Boneless In Beef Short Ribs) and the one of the noodle dishes. Both the ribs were dry and somewhat flavorless. The noodles were ok but not great. For what they were charging for these dishes, we expected better. Not sure why this place got such good review but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Best Korean in the city!
The owner's son served us last night- he is an outstanding waiter!
This was my 5th time at this restaurant and the food is consistently delicious!
Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've always been more of a reader of yelp reviews than a submitter. However, after my experience at Korean Village restaurant, I felt compelled to register for an account and place a comment. 

This was our first time dining at this restaurant and will be our last. Having stumbled into a Korean restaurant rocking Manhattan prices in Toronto with a 13% service fee on top of tax, we sat down assuming the quality of food or service must be superb to some degree. Unfortunately, we found the food disappointing for the price range and level of service was less than satisfactory.

The waitresses never wore a smile throughout the whole night, never came around to check if the food was okay and had an incredibly rude attitude while taking the menu order. Mind you, the restaurant was not even half packed when we sat down to dine.

There were inconsistencies between the two menu booklets we had which we assumed was from a price increase and the old booklet was never updated or replaced. We asked the waitress if the side dishes are refillable - they were not. Which is fine, some Korean restaurants do not offer refillable side dishes. However, mid way through our dinner the owner's son must have seen us empty out a side dish and brought over a refilled dish of the cucumber pickles. As much as we appreciated this gesture, we were told previously by the waitress that no side dishes are refillable. So... is it or is it not? or is this some strategy to rack up tips at the end? We let it slip, since to be the honest this was the best part of the entire dining experience, no joke.

We ordered the seafood pancake, beef bibimbap and gamjatang. I found the seafood pancake to be decent, however, my companions did not like the inside to be as raw as it still was since it lacked the hold when trying to pick up with chop sticks. The beef bibimbap was nothing special and quite mediocre for the price compared to other Korean restaurants in Toronto. The gamjatang was the most disappointing and probably the worst I've had in a while. The broth tasted like water, and from the smell and taste you can tell the pork bones did not go through a proper initial boil as it was almost too pungent to consume.

TIL - thoroughly disappointed with the service and food quality. For the price they charge, there are definite better alternatives."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and It would be my last time come to this place. I ordered a number 4 on the much menu. The waitress gave me a weird look when I ordered it...It is a beef soup with bean sprout. The soup tasted like water...and there is only a few beefs in the soup. I DONT RECOMMAND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This place was a clean, traditional venue with attentive service. However, the banchans (side dishes) were mediocre and the pork bone soup lacked the nuanced flavors of perilla leaves that make it so unique. The bibimbap was good at least."}
{"text":"Korean Village Restaurant - Just look for the bright yellow sign on Bloor!

The decor reminded me of a Japanese restaurant and while reading their huge menu, I noticed that they also serve Japanese food. But I stayed away from that... the restaurant has \"Korean\" in the name, after all.

What went in my belly:

Hwe Dup Bab - assorted raw fish, vegetables and rice with hot sauce ($15.99). It consisted of small pieces of chopped raw fish and vegetables which all tasted quite fresh. While it was served in a large bowl, the majority of it was filled with rice and not a whole lot of fish. At $16, I felt this dish was overpriced.

Kimchi Fried Rice - with mixed vegetables ($8.99). When it arrived at our table, I was dying to dig into it since it looked so promising. Sadly, I was left a little disappointed. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either.

Gam Ja Tang - pork bone soup with rice ($9.99). After inquiring about its spice level, the server informed us we could have it milder. Since she said milder, I didn't think she meant no spice at all. The pork bone soup arrived completely unspiced in a clear broth. I was really missing that kick...

Kal Bi -  (table top bbq) boneless short ribs of beef marinated in special sauce with rice and soup ($24.99). Found the marinade to be a little too sweet for my liking and found the price point high. Just okay.

Pork Belly -  (table top bbq) sliced loin of pork marinated in spicy and hot sauce ($18.99). Again, nothing special and the price was a little high for what it was.

Overall, I was a little disappointed by my experience here. While nothing was particularly bad, I didn't find the food to be anything special and the prices were a little steep compared to other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Made a yelp account just to give these guys 5 stars; great food, awesome service, authentic korean barbecue with quality meats and unique flair.  Great for groups, will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Went to Korean Village last night and had one of the most pleasant meal experiences of my life. 

My party of five were given a private room, and the restaurant owner's son, who was extremely warm and courteous, made thorough and personal suggestions from the menu.

The food was delicious and plentiful. I had a Soon Tofu, and while it wasn't as well presented as you'd find in Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu it was equally delicious.

Excellent experience and highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food was fast to arrive, tasty, and priced reasonably. The service was very friendly and polite. The inside was campy and cute. One of the good ones in Koreatown!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Quick take out. Decent quality tasty food with generous helpings of Kim chi etc. our go-to for Korean food on bloor."}
{"text":"Solid Korean food, even some good sushi! As well the staff is exceptional friendly! Easy to reach vie public transportation in the middle of dozens of other Korean restaurants, that though did not look as appealing from the outside."}
{"text":"recommended 

Very kind waitress, and very delicious food!!

its good for kids, its good for big groups, its good for couples.

will come back thats for sure :)"}
{"text":"Can't wait to check this place out again and explore more of their menu.

The best thing about this spot is how efficient everyone is - the service is prompt, the food comes out quickly, and we got our bills immediately after asking.

Ok I lied, the best thing is obviously the food! We each had a different bibimbap, and were blown away by how fresh and flavorful the dishes were. On top of that we had the dumplings (best I've ever had - no exaggeration!) and egg rolls. Everything was perfect.

Have to give a shout out to the manager/owner's son - he came by our table several times to check in, offer more food on the house, and generally chit chat. So refreshing to see someone take pride in the food they put out and genuinely care about their customers."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing, the staff are extremely friendly, and the food is absolutely fabulous. I loooooove this place."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 3.5 - 4 stars. The food is authentic and quite delicious. I highly recommend the BB2 (vegetarian bimbimbap) and the japchae noodles (chef's special). I love that the atmosphere and eating experience is very social and the staff are very kind and friendly. You get lots of delicious side dishes for free with your meal like kimchee and plenty of private booths for you are your party (the private booths are really cool here). The only recommendation I could make is improving the air filter in the place as you can come out smelling like cooking. Also, the booths, carpet and other areas could do with a clean/update in decor. 
Other then that I like this place a lot!"}
{"text":"If you want to choose the meat from the bbq menu, you have to choose at least two, which at least will cost you 40-50 dollars, and to be honest I don't think the portion deserves its price. The service is okay, but we don't know if the sides are refillable; I think a good waiter/waitress should ask you if you need more when you are done (I have been to other restaurant where the waiters did ask me). When we were about to pay, we didn't get our bill; instead, we were told the amount we needed to pay, which later on I know the reason is the cashier already added the tips to the bill, and the cashier did not tell us until we asked her if the tips were already included. I know sometimes when a large group come to a restaurant, tips will automatically be included. But we were just two people, and the cashier didn't even tell us. I don't know how the manager can allow the staffs to do these kinds of things in a restaurant, at least you should give customers the bill and tell customers whether the tips are included or not. Definitely not going back and won't recommend to others either."}
{"text":"Huge menu. Just about every traditional korean dish. They would probably make anything you asked for. Very friendly helpful staff and delicious food. The hwe dup bap is great as is the japchae. We have had at least ten different dishes and they all have been solid."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner at the Korean Village Restaurant last night, Jason Lee was an excellent guide to our food adventure. The food was beautiful and delicious."}
{"text":"The 4 of us went out for my bday.. we ordered the medium platter and it was more than enough. The beef was so tender and he chicken was well marinated. Great service from the son, the girls were nothing special, gave attitude. But the food made up for it. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Sadly there are only five stars to describe the restaurant. The food was excellent as one can get at many Korean restaurants. The meat was tasty and the sides were excellent.
What made it a fantastic dining experience was the level of service that we received from the owner's son Jason who was visiting the restaurant to help his mother.
He is charming, caring, and did everything to ensure that we enjoyed ourselves. My sixteen year old daughter was tickled pink.
We can't wait to go back. 
Maybe tonight!"}
{"text":"Excellent Korean food!! Really friendly family run business where they care about heir customers. Everything is homemade at this restaurant from scratch. Cute little booths you can ask to sit at too, if you are looking for more of an intimate dining experience. Definitely worth checking out :)"}
{"text":"Lots of selections on the menu, authentic food, great service and dining environment.  I am deducting a star because there are not many appetizers (only 4 kinds)"}
{"text":"Wonderfully tasty, massive amounts, and yet? You leave feeling not stuffed, definitely full, and completely satisfied. Family-owned and operated business for nearly 40 years (per the owner's son, who was a WONDERFUL host to us). I was surprised at how fresh the veggies were, the mild flavors of the kimchee and fish cakes, and the lightness of the tempura. We are HUGE fans now and if I return to Toronto, I will return to Korean Village Restaurant. Yes: it's a bit pricier than you'd likely expect. That said? The care that they take in preparing their dishes is a treat to experience (BTW: the kitchen is EXTRA speedy, even though the restaurant was pretty crowded when we dined). IF you're lucky enough to have the owner's son explain their process for the dishes you've ordered? He'll provide an education. The atmosphere is easy; the patrons are multicultural, the serving staff all are helpful, and the appetizers (plentiful!) as well as the meal are worth your visit. What a comfortable, authentic, friendly place to dine."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good Korean food! The galbi is just awesome! The restaurant's staff is a little more professional then other Korean restaurants in the area (whatever that means). A little more pricey then other restaurants in the area, but I suppose your paying for more then just your food at a nicer restaurant like that."}
{"text":"We visited Toronto and my in-laws from Korea wanted Korean food.  So we came to Korean Village seeking authentic Korean dining with Yelp's help.  The Korean name for the place is \"Han Kuk Kwan\" which means \"Korean Pavillion.\"  The sense behind the title is an exhibition of Korean culture at an international fair, set apart for cultural distinctiveness.  To our disappointment, we arrived to find a place that was decidedly less Korean and more Japanese in decor.  There was a sushi bar and the walls had a very Japanese feel.  Even the chopstick covers had \"irrashaimase\" (welcome) printed in Japanese.  The meat dishes were served with a side of miso shiru (Japanese white soybean soup) rather than dwenjang jjigae (Korean fermented soybean paste stew).   For a place with a name that would seem to proudly display Korean culture, the Japanese elements were almost offensive to my in-laws.  I wouldn't have noted these things if the restaurant had titled itself as a Korean-Japanese fusion place.

All that being said, the food is OK, but not spectacular as far as Korean food goes.  The al-jjigae (fish egg stew) either did not use pollack eggs or they used ones of low quality which came in unsatisfyingly small sacks.  The LA Galbi was tasty but a bit on the rubbery side.  Evidently the meat was pan-fried like yaki-niku and not char-grilled over an open flame as true Korean BBQ would require.  The ox tail soup (kko li gom tang) was decent, but the waitress was surprised when my father-in-law asked for black pepper.  Usually, Korean broths are seasoned with salt and pepper, which are usually provided so the customer can season to taste.  It would be like serving fries without ketchup.  Overall, the food was just OK, not 4.5 star quality in my view.  The side dishes were fresh, but merely par for the course.  The service quality was good.

The place is run by Koreans, but it appeared to me that the primary clientelle are not Koreans, but other nationalities who would not mind the non-Korean elements in the decor and food.  The name \"Han Kuk Kwan\" oversells the Koreanness of the place.  Rather, it is a mish mash of Asian dining with a heavy emphasis in Korean and Japanese.  This Korean-American expected more faithful representation in the multiethnic melting pot that is Toronto."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, large dining area-it doesn't get any better than this. My boyfriend and I have only been here twice, however we plan to come back many more times. The owner's son recognized us the second time we visited and he was very chatty and friendly. Kudos to him for making everyone feel so welcomed. I recommend any of the Seafood dishes as they are very tasty. Complimentary side dishes are always a bonus too. We have spent $50.00 + each visit , but it is SO worth it. Keep up the good work and thank you."}
{"text":"Out of the various Korean Restaurants I've been to in Toronto, Korean Village Restaurant is by the far the best for Korean BBQ I've experienced here.  The food was excellent, and service was efficient and really friendly.  Plus the prices were very reasonable.

I was with a friend from South Korea who said this was authentic to what he would eat back home.  We went with about 7 of us, and had our own little seating area separate from the rest of the tables.  It made it much more relaxed and we all just had a great time with our food and drinks.  Also, as soon as you walk in you can see pics of various celebrities who eat there as well.  Some who are also regulars, so if you go maybe you'll run into someone famous.

I definitely recommend this place for Korean food, and if you're into singing your heart away without a care, just steps away are multiple Karaoke bars to choose from.  It makes for a fun night out for all:)"}
{"text":"the ambiance is good , food is better  and the hospitality/ service is the best. This is the first Korean place where I had the best service, we went there with a group of 7 during our trip to toronto. Jason helped us with the BBQ , he was shared  his knowledge about the food, how they prepare kimchi in theor location and made our time really pleasant. 

Thanks for the good food , money well worth and also thanks for the on house desert."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat with friends,  family or a first date.  The owners and staff make interactive Korean dining fun and friendly.  My wife and I highly recommend the Korean BBQ meats cooked at the table. Our waiter was very helpful in starting us off with the BBQ and occasionally checked in on us to make sure all was fine. The food was fresh,  flavourful and authentic.  The accompaniments to the meats (kimchi, freshly pickled sprouts, steamed rice) were tasty and went well with the crisp lettuce leaves used to hold all of it together.  For our dessert,  we had one strawberry flavoured machine each,  which is the perfect end to an excellent meal.  Would highly recommend dining here."}
{"text":"We had a great time. The food was very tasty, staff was courteous and extremely hospitable. Only suggestion is to update the ventilation, especially in the private rooms."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in Calgary, we always make an effort to visit this restaurant for lunch. What we appreciate most about this place is the consistency. This restaurant isn't as cheap as others, but we've become loyal customers because the food is always tasty and service is always great.

Keep it up and we'll keep on coming!"}
{"text":"Very kid friendly.    Lovely owners...Jason is consistently great.  Food is delicious.   You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Authentic Korean cuisine. The staff and most of the clientele is also Korean, so you know the food is good. The staff is genuinely nice and the food is absolutely suburb. K11 is my personal favorite, it's is hot spicy beef soup with glass noodles."}
{"text":"This place used to be Dae Jung Geum Restaurant but the owner sold his business and now the place is taken over by Korean Village. 

I used to order the Gam Ja tang(Pork bone with potato soup) at Dae Jung Geum, so when i went back and it was Korean Village i ordered the same. It definitely didn't taste the same, in fact it tasted way worse. 

I did go back a few more times to try other dishes such as the Spicy Chicken and Black bean noodles but those were lacking in deliciousness as well. 

The set up of the restaurant has the booths sort of hidden from the server's view so it's hard to flag down the server or get their attention. 

I really wanted to like this place since it was so close to my home but i couldn't bring myself to. After having eaten at most of the korean restaurants in Calgary i'd have to give this place a 2 stars based on both the poor quality of their service and dishes."}
{"text":"I'm spoiled from eating Korean BBQ in L.A. But this place was still really good! The kimchi sides were amazing and perfect! We loved the pork belly BBQ but would probably splurge to get the prime steak next time instead of the cheaper beef. You won't leave this place hungry that's for sure!! They cook the meat for you at your table and then you can eat it anyway you want with all the sides. Very yummy. The best part was the service. The owner (his mom started the restaurant) was so friendly and always checking on us to make sure we were enjoying the food and having a good time. He even gave us complimentary dessert when he heard we were from out of town! Tip; if you're gonna order wine to drink, order a whole bottle - not much more $ but much more wine than 2 glasses!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else in here, the service is outstanding. The owner's son is the smoothest host I've ever encountered. He makes you feel welcome and this would be the main reason I'd come back to Korean Village. 

The food itself is good, but not great. The panchan is pretty plentiful, but not spectacular and the kimchi is average at best. The kamjatang was a bit disappointing but the dolsots (hot sizzling dishes of many varieties) were very good. I wouldn't recommend the place as a bbq hangout. You have to get it done charcoal style (built-in) for the full experience. They also don't provide all of the sides with the bbq unless you ask for it. The haemul pajeon was huge, but not very tasty. Prices are more than reasonable and the atmosphere is great with lots of options for private booths. 

Overall, I'd take friends and family here for their first experience, but would avoid with more experienced Korean eaters."}
{"text":"A wide variety of dishes, all sumptuous, and friendly service. A step above any of the other Korean BBQ venues we've visited in Calgary. A longer than expected wait time for food was our one disappointment."}
{"text":"Had dinner with three friends here and it was an excellent experience.  The food was very good quality and the service was delightful.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A restaurant that is typically packed, and brimming with lots of personality. The walls of its entrance are lined with pictures of celebrities who've eaten there and articles about it from its inception. Overall, it's a decent place to have some home-y korean, although it is priced on the high side. 

Food (4/5): My bf and I shared some in-bone kalbi, seafood korean pancake and kimchi fried rice. Overall each dish was well done, but nothing completely special or mind blowing. The korean pancake had a nice crisp with decent amount of seafood in it. The kimchi fried rice was flavored thoroughly with kimchi and not too greasy. Lastly, the in-bone kalbi was thin and the meat was soft with nice grill marks. They only offered us 4 banchan here (the side dishes): Kimchi, cucumber, bean sprout, kimchi tofu skin. I prefer a better variety of banchan tho. 

Price (3/5): On the expensive side. This place does have alot of history and is a staple in Korea town, therefore the price scales with its popularity. With tax and tip what we ordered above came up to just above $60. I mean both of us were really full by the end of it because the portions are decently sized. It's not like we felt robbed or anything, but my bf and I agree that we could've eaten just as well for a cheaper price at another korean establishment along the bloor strip.

Service (3.5/5): The food came out surprisingly quick considering how packed the restaurant was, however the service was slightly jumbled as well. We had actually received our first dish before our waitress brought us any plates or utensils to eat with (awkward..). But service was quick and standard for a typical asian run resto. 

Ambiance (4/5):  What I liked about Korean Village restaurant were the large tables and attempt at making the restaurant feel village like with all the wood decorations. It's slightly messy as in a restaurant that's consistently busy but overall the experience was satisfying.

Overall, I'd recommend coming here if you don't mind spending alittle extra. I consider it as paying tribute to a piece of Torontonian history. I'd personally like to return to try their table-top BBQ , pork bone soup, and bibimbap."}
{"text":"Food here is very good.  Although there are cheaper options, the portions and and the service here makes it worth it.  In particular, the owner's son is an exceptional host.

One would notice that they don't have exhaust right at the tables to get rid of the BBQ smoke, but their BBQ don't smoke as much as other Korean BBQ do.  They also help make sure the BBQ is done just right if its being barbecued at table."}
{"text":"If I could give a restaurant 10 stars I would. I almost feel like going back and re-ranking every 5 star review I've ever written down to 4 just because of Korean Village.

My boyfriend and I went to Toronto for one day last summer, and after having been back in Canada for three years after two years spent in Korea, I was aching for delicious, authentic Korean food. Korean Village went so far beyond this, I could not be more satisfied or more grateful.

The owner's son I've seen referenced here on Yelp before and there's good reason for that. He came by our table and after chatting briefly and unobtrusively he discovered that I was \"home sick\" for Korea and especially for Korean food. He was excited to hear this, but soon left as our order arrived. The food tsted exactly like everything I remembered and so badly missed from my favourite barbecue restaurants in Seoul. I would have been thrilled with that, and the soju, and the amazing and attentive service, but on top of that the owner's son came back time and time again and every time he blew me away. This guy was so excited by my excitement that he started bringing us out off-menu food that he and his family had prepared for themselves. He brought us desserts that they were inventing to add to the menu (Mochi with an icecream centre! Of course!).

It wasn't that we got more than we paid for that made this place so amazing. It was the inclusion we got from the owners and the staff. They made us feel so welcome, which is something Koreans are rightly famous for in my experience. We had enough  time to ourselves to eat far more incredible food than was absolutely necessary, to get respectably tipsy and for one of us to learn a respectable amount of Korean curse words. At just the right moments we'd be interrupted by something incredible and unexpected and again be made to feel even more at home.

I'll be back to Korean Village every time I visit Toronto and the next visit can't come soon enough. 10 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. My friend and I went to this restaurant a few weeks ago, and it was our first time trying Korean food. Jay was our server and when we expressed that we had no idea what to order and hadn't tried Korean before, he asked us a few questions about what we liked and made recommendations. He brought out some amazing samples/appetizers for us to try, and our mains were fantastic. I had a noodle dish in a black bean sauce that was just to die for. I forget the name of it, but Jay was kind enough to write down the dishes for both of us (which my friend still has). The service was just above and beyond any expectation of even the finest restaurant. Jay was genuine and lovely. The food was fantastic, and I can't wait to bring more friends there to try it too!"}
{"text":"Was curving for Korean food, so decided to try this place out. We decided to do korean bbq with 4 people so we ordered a medium sorted meat (chicken, shrimp, beef, pork belly) which comes with 4 bowel of rice. We also ordered an appetizer, rice cake. The rice cake is not that spicy which usually is spicy in some other Korean restaurant, which I like it since I don't take spicy that much. The beef was well marinated which taste good. The chicken was awsome, it does have taste in it. Look like a special recipe. The service was great., which the waiter help us to cook the meat on the grill and also kindly help us to refill the side dishes because one of our friend likes the side dishes ( kimchi, dry tofu). I do recommend order the large sorted meat plate with 4 people, if you decide to bbq. The medium size sorted meat plate might not be filling for 4 people that are hungry. But since me and my friends were not that hungry we were ok. The restaurant accept cards unlike some other Korean restaurant that doesn't. Overall, the place was good, if you happen to be in that area(downtown), you should try it."}
{"text":"Having lived in Korea for a year, this is definitely an authentic Korean restaurant. We were a table of five and were filled to the gills with an order of Galbi (for two), an order of bulgolgi, and an order of dumplings. Of course, you get all the side dishes you want including radish, bean sprouts, kimchi, potatoes, and seaweed salad. Make sure you ask for a table with the bbq built into it because it's much better than them preparing it behind the scenes. The service was friendly, but sometimes we had to waive them down for something because they didn't check in with us frequently enough. The price of Soju is outrageous, but this is similar at any Korea restaurant in Canada. Great dining experience all in all."}
{"text":"There are so many good alternatives along this strip of Bloor that it's hard to see how they are competing.  The food is average and overpriced but the service is personal and efficient so perhaps that's why it's so busy. And it being so busy might also explain why the place has the in-need-of-some-maintenance feel to it."}
{"text":"As you may have read in the other reviews in 2010, this is the new Korean Village location situated in a mini strip mall I consider to be Calgary's own little Korea-town. This place is authentic. The food is great, but not the best Korean food I've had in town or even when I compare it to the Seoul International Airport's food. The best thing that makes Korean Village stand out from the other Korean restaurants in Calgary is their service; they typically have more staff around compared to others in town. Their pork bone soup, gam ja tang, is delicious and is one of my favorites and they make a really nice seafood pancake :) Friendly and courteous staff! Value could be a tad better, but overall it's a great place to enjoy a Korean meal in a relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We were about 6 people and wanted to order barbecue, and the attendant suggested we order the large portion. The side dishes were amazing. We guys also ordered the rice cakes in spicy sauce, dumplings and rice noodles with vegetables. Everything was just perfect. The owners son is amazing and made the whole experience funny. He has a great sense of humour and very friendly.

Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The building was beautiful on the outside and had a rustic look on the inside. However the food and its price did not meet up to my expectations. I ordered a Korean dinner sampler ( No 1) and the beef was cooked well however did not warrant a $30 price tag, it did however come with sushi and a soup but it just didn't taste good to put it simply. Maybe I didn't order the right thing. Bottom Line if your looking for an authentic looking restaurant and pricey somewhat good food then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem the owner is a great guy he remembers everyone's name pretty impressive. The food is amazing also I usually Korean bbq and always leave happy."}

Korean Village Restaurant is yet another one of those Korean restaurants found in Christie area. After trying couple restaurants there, I've kind of given up hope in finding good Korean food in this area and have ventured my way up to Yonge and Finch.

However, since their reviews were quite decent on yelp, we decided to try Korean Village restaurant for dinner one day with couple of people.

Starting with their tacky yellow neon sign outside, inside of the restaurant is spacious but cluttered with every type of useless decoration possible. There were tables, booths, rooms in every corner I just could not figure out where the restaurant ended.

BanChan (sidedishes), these looked pretty decent but it was nothing special. Most of them tasted off (not seasoned right) and it lacked flavor.

Ordered: Deep fried gyoza 2/5

* 9~10 pieces of deep fried pork gyoza
* They came really hot right out of the fryer
* Dumpling skin was hot and crispy but filling lacked flavor
* This could have been store bought
* It was nothing special and I wouldn't get it again

Ordered: Kalbi Dinner 3/5

* This was a dinner menu served with rice and soup
* Kalbi (meat) was quite tough and chewy and over marinated
* Marinade was good but it just doesn't work when the meat lacks quality
* Served with bowl of white rice and miso soup
* Good for it's price but wouldn't skip meals for it

Ordered: Bi-Bim-Naeng-Myun 3/5

* This is usually perfect for summer time since it is served cold
* Noodle served with spicy sauce and sashimi
* Noodle was over cooked and stuck together and I had to pull it apart
* There wasn't enough sashimi in this dish
* Sauce was a little too spicy and it didn't have enough vinegar
* I just don't know why it's so hard to find a good Bi-Bim-Naeng-Myun in Toronto

Summary: Nothing impressed me at Korean Village- food was mediocre and service was awful. I would probably never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"They open 11-11. No afternoon break. Really good for small group between lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"The restaurant is spacious and busy which shows how good and popular it is. There are some more private rooms too. The food is good and the portions are generous. The son of the owner was really nice and we were impressed that he can talk a lot of languages."}
{"text":"After being away from Korea for two years,  I was really looking forward to some authentic BBQ and this was the place to get it! Food was just as I remembered it and we had excellent service.  Had a hilarious and great encounter with the owner's son which added to the already good experience..  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I literary loved it!! 
Although I haven't tried other Korean restaurants in Calgary (my first experience was in BC- Insadong Restaurant), I think this place was perfect! It had really good decor and surprisingly good survive .. 
At first we were worried that the workers there won't speak English and not be able to communicate with them, but they did speak and were extra sweet and helpful :D they helped us adjust the fire and we're always checking on us from time to time.. 
And the food.. Owwh my!! It was magical (I know, I'm ex exaggerating) XD i ordered the bbq short ribs and rice cakes (wasn't really spicy which we liked). The meat was soft and tender. The \"purple\" rice was good especially when adding some of the ricecake's sauce on iMy friend got seafood pancakes, And chiken. She didn't like the sweet sauce they put on the chiken, but loved the seafood pancakes (it was her very first time trying korean food) so I would say it's a good start to try these pancakes if you're new to the korean taste! 
Overall! We enjoyed the food and service there :D I'm deffinitely going there again!!
Maybe the only thing that would give this place 5 stars, if their chopsticks weren't of a bad wooden quality :p if they only had metal ones it would've been better ..."}
{"text":"Of the top meals a good Yakiniku is right up there with Tonkatsu and Tempura. I find it difficult to find a good table BBQ place in Calgary and though Korean Village will not blow you away, it isn't bad either.

We got the BBQ Set A which feeds 3-4 people. I was with some big eaters and we felt the portions of BBQ was sufficient to satisfy our hunger. It came with four different kinds of meat, one chicken and 3 different beefs. The meats fared well. 3 were satisfactory, but the caramelized beef was really good and exceeded my expectations. The dumplings that came with the set was delicious though I am sure pre-packaged. 

I found the service to be attentive and pleasant. They move fast dropping dishes down and your table and turning to leave quickly. However, if you got there attention the would stop and get you what you need like another vessel of rice or more ice water.

3.5 stars kind of place for me. Nice work KVR!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. The quality and incredible service here blows away anything you've had at any of the other Korean style BBQ spots. This has become my go to place for Korean BBQ. As everyone mentioned, if the son is there he will make your service even better. His comedic ways will have you laughing in no time. Bottom line, this place is amazing. I'm going back tonight for my third visit and I'm wearing my track pants. Food coma here I come. Lol"}
{"text":"I visited there twice, and I enjoyed the experience both times.

Their BBQ is delicious, and the owner's son comes around to make sure we are having a great time there :)

And I like the atmosphere, too; feels quite authentic.

The only down side of it is the menu. If you cannot read Korean, it is hard to follow (and it is rather big). Luckily, I went both times with my Korean friend, who knew what to order."}
{"text":"My experience was not as good as others in Yelp. The dumpling soup was expensive,  and not so good because it tasted too much to seaweed. They didn't bring us water at the beginning,  and everyone had water but us. I went there with my Korean. She says,  the beef rib soup is good. Nonetheless,  my experience is 2 stars. For her it is 3 stars because the soup was good. I think so too."}
{"text":"Great food with proper portions but an old lady had a bit of an attitude with extremely slow service. Our side dishes were sitting around for nearly half an hour. Visited this place at around 3:30pm so the restaurant was quite empty. Lunch special was ending at 4pm so my friend and I decided to order meals from the lunch special menu. Maybe that's why she was behaving that way I don't know. Forgot to take a pic because we were in a bit of a rush."}
{"text":"We were starving.  We ended up parking in front of this restaurant.  
The conversation went a little bit like \"It's here, we're here, they have food.\"

What a pleasant surprise!
This place is huge. The decor is pleasant...bamboo, chimes, and dark wood.  The private booths are really cute.  Tons of space and there was no line-up.

I like a lot of free appetizers.
Kim chi (of course),  pickles, sweet beans, seaweed, yummy potato bits, bean sprouts.

My friend ordered the pork bone soup with rice.  The server (without us asking) brought her a plate of diced extra hot rocket peppers because she said she wanted her food extra spicy.

I had the bi bim bab which was super tasty. I was pleased with the beef to veggie ratio. I hate it when they don't give me enough beef.

One thing that sets this place apart from the others is the service.
The owner's son is a phenomenal server!

He made sure our teacups were always full with rice-green tea
He was knowledgeable about the menu items and made good recommendations (Lol, he pointed out items his mom likes).
Overall, he was super attentive and super nice.

The food here is made with fresh ingredients.  Everything tasted great!
The menu is HUGE. I would like to come back and try their Korean pancakes and the BBQ.  It's interesting that the menu has Japanese items as well.   Not sure if they are good, but I enjoyed the Korean items anyway.

I had a great meal and this restaurant is one of my new favorites in K-town.  The items are a bit more expensive than neighboring restaurants, but the ambiance and service are more than worth it!

Oh! And Jackie Chan, Chow Yun Fat, and other celebs apparently go here for Korean grub when in T-Dot.  Well, that's what I heard and their pictures are in the entrance.  I'll have to ask about the photos next time. :)"}
{"text":"This is the one of the oldest korean restaurant in korea town and well managed over decades.

They have good variety of korean dishes menu and even sushi as well:)

Authentic Korean BBQ is must try.

Perfect place for a group or family dinner. 

One time I tried sashimi donburi which is fish and salad bowl with rice was so good!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible

The waitress didn't mention that we can't separate our bills, so we had a trouble at the end. They let us pay separate but they include the tip by themselves at the counter. Also keep complaining they can't go for separate bills like we did. Keep complaining until our last member paid. 

Then they said we can't use card when the price is below $20. How come they didn't inform us when we order if they has this strict rule of payment?

Also, after all of my crew paid our own meals, the lady called us back and said we did not paid fully so we can't leave. It seems like they miss calculate our order and keep telling us that we didn't pay enough and it was our drink orders. We told them to check the table and count the empty bottle for the numbers of drink we order and they admit they miscounted but never said sorry for treating us that way. 

And the food was not worth it for the price. My seafood noodle soup has only two mussels that has been melted already cause they over cooked. And other seafood I had inside of my soup was so few-one shrimp, two mussels and few left over parts of squid. I paid like $17 because they include the tip and it was not even worth like $10 soup I can purchase at other stores near by. 

I would not return this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  Better Korean than in Chicago (but both still lag behind Atlanta...).  Had the kalbi, samgyubsal (pork belly) and a couple dolsot bibimbabs (pork and kimchi/beef) that were all good.  Sides were all good and fresh.  Portions aren't huge and you have to ask for rice, but otherwise a great place and good prices, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I think Korean Village is by far the best Korean restaurant in Calgary. Excellent food and excellent service! My family usually go there as a large group, and we've always enjoyed their bbq and hot pot combos. My personal summer-time favourite is the cold noodles with spicy sauce or cold beef broth. The staff are always keen on service and making sure our drinks complimentary side dishes were fulfilled. We always appreciate the authentic taste and consistency of the food, even for the ten+ years that we've been patrons to Korean Village."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! This was my first time eating Korean food and one of my colleague (Thanks Justin!!) recommended this place. The food was amazing! I can't say the name of all the dishes we ate but the spicy ribs, spicy pork, sweet and sour chicken and the seafood soup was delicious and it was plenty of food for the 6 of us. Next time I come visit I'll sure be eating at this place again. I recommended this place 100%"}
{"text":"Loved this place, got the galbi tang and spicy chicken stone bowl. I was impressed because the appetizer portion was very Generous AND very yummy. There were lots of space in the restaurant which is what u would prefer over sunrise house. We went at 11am so there wasn't many people anyway so there was no wait time, I would imagine the turnover would be better at night with this amount of space. 

Will definitely come back !"}
{"text":"Horrible service, waited 30mins and the side dishes aren't even here. Server was even getting annoyed when we asked for both tea and water, WTH! Can't believe this! What's even worse is that the table next to us which came after us got their food and our side dishes aren't even here. The place isn't even busy!!! Only reason I gave this place a one star is the fact that I can't give anything lower and that the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Sorry yelpers, not a fan of this place.

Definitely not the best place for Korean food in Toronto. 

Had high hopes for this place based on yelp reviews and was quite disappointed by the outcome.

The service wasn't fantastic as everyone was stating unless I guess u get the owners son who I witness talking to a few tables about his life and such if you're into that sort of thing. We got the other waitress that seemed like she rather be watching Korean dramas then serving tables (but who wouldn't right?) just a small smile would have been nice though. 

Anyways we ordered the bulgogi dinner and the pork bone soup which were over priced so I thought they would be exceptional and authentic. Unfortunately they were not that great and definitely not at that price point. The side dishes were horrible and tasted like someone youtubed how to make side dishes and then brought them out to our table.

Overall, I give this place 2 stars. 1 star for the pic with Chow Yun Fat and the owner in the doorway and the other 1 star because the washroom was clean for Koreatown standards.

My search for the best PBS in Toronto continues...."}
{"text":"The Annex has several Korean restaurants to choose from with similar quality. Korean Village is above average in regards to quality, but you are also paying significantly more for your meal. 

Inside, they have several pictures of celebrities who have been to the restaurant so it's definitely the place to be.

Everything is great, but with the higher prices, I would expect unlimited Banchan. They are offer it once at the beginning and that is it."}
{"text":"A group of us were visiting Toronto for a long weekend and had a couple in the group that have never had Korean BBQ. We pulled up Yelp and one of the group members saw the picture of Jackie Chan and decided if he went there we had to also. We were able to get in right away which was great since we were all starving from walking around all day.

After ordering enough food for a crowd we started cooking. I like to cook the sliced garlic on the grill, this must be a no-no since the waitress scolded me for doing so and promptly removed them off the grill. I hung my head in shame for a couple of seconds, did a shot of soju and got back to grilling. 

I wish they had hood vents over the tables as some Korean bbq places do as we all walked out of there smelling like grilled food. Overall everyone enjoyed the food and was a good way to end our trip."}
{"text":"My family and I chose this restaurant based on its good Yelp reviews.  We were not disapointed.  The food was excellent and the service was even better. The owners son took a great deal of pride in his family's dishes and spent quite a bit of time explaining them to us. One of the best dining experiences we have ever had."}
{"text":"The best korean restaurant in Calgary. This has been our only korean reastaurant for 10 years and more for sure. The food are so good. Customer service is top notch."}
{"text":"Not bad ... 

Much more spacious than their former location.  I remember eating at their former location 10(?)ish years ago while I was still an undergrad ... I remember leaving their restaurant after a date with my clothes and hair INFUSED with smokey meat smell  :(  Not very attractive.

Anyway, I returned to their new location with my former date and now husband (good thing the meaty smokey smell didn't turn him off) and have to say the increase in space and better ventilation system has really helped minimize the smokey meat smell that gets into your hair and clothes.

Food was pretty good - better than I remembered ...

Favourites include:

Bibim Bap, Bulgolgi, Kalbi, and Glass Noodles 

Prices are kind of expensive compared to other asian cuisines but that is expected with Korean food.  

Service was average.

FYI:  This new location is located by some other Korean stores so you can do some grocery shopping before or after your meal."}
{"text":"The food here was really great and everyone in our party enjoyed their time and meals! We made a reservation so we were seated promptly in a private booth which was really nice; we appreciated the privacy. The wait staff were great, always checking to see if we needed to check anything. HOWEVER. The absolute highlight of the night was Jason, the owner's son. He came in to our booth towards the end of the meal and completely blew us away. He spoke to us in our native languages (Spanish, Sinhalese, and Cantonese) and gave us a really cool history lesson, with artifacts that he carries around in his wallet! And apparently he doesn't even work here, he just came to visit his mother! I would definitely come here again (in fact we're already planning our next trip), and I would recommend this place to anyone who would listen."}
{"text":"Best korean bbq I've had in a long time. The quality of the meat was superb and I'm not sure what marinade they used for the bul gog ki, but it was delicious. Haven't had authentic korean bbq for years. Reminds me of some places up at Yonge and Finch. I'm never going back to the AYCE restaurants. Quality over quantity.

The service was extremely helpful and we didn't even have to turn over the meat. Someone was at our table every 2 minutes to watch over our bbq. 

Love this place and I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. J was an excellent host and I would highly recommend coming. Pork bone soup was not salty to the point where one needs to down water after dinner. Dil soy bimbimpap was filler and delicious. Gonna need to return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"All time fav Korean spot. Just try not to come when it's super busy on weekends. Seafood pancake and their sweet and sour pork is bomb."}
{"text":"The best Korean food in town!!!! Amazing place with extraordinary owners! This delicious food will put you in the delight mood! Trust me! You don't want to go there, because you will understood that your life was empty and sad before your first visit!"}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night and loved the atmosphere and authentic Korean BBQ! I came with a friend and we ordered the beef ribs and pork belly and it was more than enough food for the two of us. The ribs were amazing, however the pork belly was a bit too fatty for my liking. I loved all the wonderful sides that came with the orders including pickled tofu, kimchi and bean sprouts. Would definitely go again and try the other amazing dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Look. I honestly don't remember the food very well....it wasn't that great, but the one waitress there is honestly insane....very very strange. Wouldn't let me order some stuff, and just displayed a weird attitude to anything. I haven't been back because of her, and there is only one other restaurant in Sydney that I don't go to, because a particular staff is so obnoxious."}
{"text":"- my thoughts are, if jackie chan and sandra oh dine in a restaurant... you should too. 
- the wall near the entrance is full of photos with the mgt/owner team, and you catch a glimpse of random celebrities.
- the food is pretty solid. did the assortment bbq platter. and it didnt disappoint!! a little more expensive than most places, but the ambiance fun, loud, and fast paced. 
- this place now ranks #2  in ktown."}
{"text":"Been to this place for table BBQ 3 times this year. The waitresses really rush you even when there aren't many people in the restaurant. So they turn the heat up really high and the meat becomes less tender. They also use the same tongs for raw meat and cooked meat, so I had to out back the cooked meat on the grill again just in case.

There is an automatic 13% service charge which is 13% of the bill AFTER tax."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!  The food was delicious, the service was prompt & attentive & all the employees were extremely friendly & welcoming.  The owner greeted us & seated us herself when we walked in.  Her son/restaurant manager went table to table to check on everyone.  His name is Jay and he was absolutely lovely. When hearing we were from out of town, he gave us a special dessert from off the menu, 2 shots of soju in souvenir glasses to take with us, & 2 bottled waters for the road.  The service was amazing and the food was unforgettable!  I'll definitely be returning to this great restaurant every time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Will admit off the top, I haven't found a ton of Korean food I love and I live in the neighbourhood, as I am mostly a vegetarian, I have far fewer options. This not a refined looking restaurant inside, it's full of cluttery odds and ends and knick knacks, but it has a warm friendly atmosphere and there are separated booths/rooms you can eat in. This is not a strictly Korean place as there are things like sushi on the menu which my hubby has ordered a lot of and he enjoys it. This is a good family friendly place which is unusually large for a downtown restaurant. I usually get the jap chae noodles, for my taste, I like them. Mercifully, the starters are nice as otherwise I don't end up eating much."}
{"text":"I had their beef and kimchi  bi bim bap in stone bowl (served really hot, don't burn your tongue). It tasted great but I don't know why the price was significantly higher than other Korean restaurants. I also had their seafood noodle soup which was good but the mussels in the soup didn't taste as good as they should have. The seafood noodle soup serving is large so I couldn't finish the whole dish."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Been craving for a good korean bbq place and visited this place on my trip to Toronto. Not bad, but it ain't the best. Meat was well marinated. We went on Victoria day and there was some lineup but were seated as soon as we asked the waitress for a table - otherwise who knows when you'd get attended. Portions are ok, and the small dishes are quite limited, compared with the korean bbq restaurants in China."}
{"text":"I came to Toronto for the weekend. My friends and I wanted korean bbq one night and I must say, this is one of the best korean bbq places I've had. The meat tasted delicious and the owner's son took the time to help us cook the meat and welcome us to Toronto. It was truly a great experience :)"}
{"text":"What can I say, my korean food craving is real. This restaurant comes the closest to my mom's cooking and I've enjoyed my visit every time. I know there's lots of other places, because it's Korea town, but I keep coming back here, because the quality is so good. The restaurant itself is very spacious compared to what you see from the outside and the service is outstanding as well.

I haven't tried the Korea BBQ here, but I've tried other dishes that really satisfies my cravings like jajangmyun, nyangmyun, pork bone soup, kanpoongi, and tangsooyook and they were all so good. I have no doubt that the other dishes will be great as well. All in all, I'm smittened by this place and wish I lived closer so I can go there more often."}
{"text":"Not bad! 

Korean BBQ forevah! 

Not that cheap, average priced items... maybe add more portions."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Korean food and I was blown away!! After watching countless Kdrama characters eat jjangmyeon (did I spell that right?) I wanted to try it for myself and boy was I impressed. I highly recommend their jjangmyeon, and bi bim bap. I will come back as often as I can!!! The ambience is also great. FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place. I've been going here for over 10 years, since I was 15 years old. The owner her son and all the staff are all so amazing and kind. Somehow the staff remember me and it is like going to a friends home every time I walk through those doors. 

That's not to mention that the food is amazing. Doesn't matter what time of day, year or month. Love this place... a must go always!!!"}
{"text":"Got a last minute reservation for 12, we were put in a private room and had the owners son, Jay, as our server. He was amazing. Lots of jokes, suggested the perfect meals and amount of food for our group, taught us how to use our Korean BBQ and brought a round of delicious dumplings on the house. Can't wait for the next time I need a place to go with a big group. Great experience all around. I could not get enough of the housemade noodles with black bean sauce."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The owner's son, Jason, is amazing and gives some of the best customer service I've had in this city. 

The food is great, the service is great, the private rooms are great, the prices are great. What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times. Food was good, friendly staffs and they cook for you. We always get the medium or large meat/ seafood platter to share. It's great if you want variety. 
For all the clean freak like me, bathroom was dirty. It could use some cleaning and scrubbing."}
{"text":"This is one of the older Korean restaurant in the Bloor and Christie area AKA as Koreatown. You could tell right away as soon as you walk into the place with pictures of the celebrities with the restaurant owner and the dated decor how long this place has been in business. The restaurant layout is big and they are able to accommodate large parties. Also, the washrooms seems to have been recently renovated and are a huge improvement over other restaurants in the area. 

We came here for a Thursday lunch and they were able to accommodate our group of 8 without any issues. The place was not full but it wasn't empty either. The place only had two servers: one male and one female. I can understand the critique about the slow service as even though we didn't encounter any issues, the servers especially the male one, were extremely busy. They were not very attentive even though the place wasn't busy. 

We ordered the Donkatsu lunch combo, Jjampong, Jajangmyeon and Salmon Teriyaki lunch combo. The food was very good and our party had no complaints about the food. I ordered the Jjampong and the broth was very spicy and flavorful however, the squid was overcooked. The noodles were cooked right. The Jajangmyeon was also very good. 

The clientele is not mainly Korean and one of the reason why it has been around for so long. This place is recommended."}
{"text":"Positive: Service is alright. 

Negative: Weird decoration, i feel like sitting in a jungle and i didn't know Korea is this tropical. Pricey compare to local competition. Worst pork bone soup I have ever tried in Korea town. Extra cost for side dish refill. 

Suggestion: Go to \"The owl on bloor' down the street (opens 24 hours -  cash only) or Korea house (amazing side dishes and free refills)"}
{"text":"Quality of the meat was definitely better than at an AYCE, but the servers came over and cooked the food for us. This annoyed me as I like to eat at my own pace and not have the server at the table looming over us. It really ruined the fun of cooking your own meat.

Side dishes were ok. You have to pay for extra, which sucked. 

Ambiance was nice with lots of bamboo and dried flowers. 

Service was abrupt and several of the servers appeared to be upset or annoyed with one another.

Was just ok. No real reason return."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience and delicious food. I found this place on yelp and am thankful for the recommendation. I took my parents who had never had Korean food before and the owner's son came to our table and guided them through the menu with helpful tips on what to order. Service was fantastic and we had a button at our table to summon the waiter! We had the  glass noodles and BBQ meat which were delicious. Reasonably priced as well - about $100 (before tax & tip) for a filling meal for 5 adults. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever at a korean restaurant and I was not disappointed. When we first walked in I was a little confused on where to go, if we just walk in or do we stand there and wait for someone to greet us. Luckily someone was walking by and seated us at a table. The restaurant was also kind of empty, we went on a Friday afternoon. I was a little familiar with the foods so I had no problem ordering. Overall I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Probably one of the greatest customer service experiences I've ever had going to a restaurant. It was my first time at a BBQ joint, so I didn't know how to make anything. The staff was welcoming and helped me get used to how things run, and gave me pointers as to how to do everything. From beginning to end I had the upmost happiness at this  restaurant. Fantastic !"}
{"text":"The la kalbi BBQ dinner here is awesome. Not only was the meat delicious; I loved the side dishes that came with the dinner. We were served a variety of side dishes including bean sprouts, fish cake, pickled cabbage, kimchi, and zucchini.

The BBQ meat also came with lettuce leaves, mushrooms, miso soup, and rice. I enjoyed the quality of the meat as well. The marinade for the beef short ribs added a depth of flavour to the meat. My favourite part of Korean BBQ is grilling the kimchi, which cooks in the meat juices and it becomes carmalized, making the kimchi slightly sweet. 

Our servers the owner and son of the restaurant were great. Especially the owner's son. He is very friendly. He made sure that the meat was cooked perfectly and not over done. 

For a Sunday night the place was fairly busy. It's also pretty big so there's a lot of seating. 

I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. Very authentic. I always come here with my family. They have the best shared dishes."}
{"text":"I had such a great time at this restaurant! I lived in Korea many years ago and this experience reminded me of those days.

We ordered the kalbi and pork belly to BBQ. We were sent dumplings on the house - yum yum! The side dishes were perfect - kimchi was so tasty. The owners son came over and helped us BBQ. He provided some tips and totally took our BBQ experience to another level.

He also brought over some special side dishes and gave us a gift!

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here.

A few of us came out to try the Korean BBQ, the real kind, not the AYCE Chinese version.

We ordered bbq bulgogi, pork belly and beef.. something else. We also had an order of the Korean Village sushi roll. Everything was super delicious, including the  side dishes. The service was great, the person who was manning the grill at our table seemed to have a sixth sense as to when things were ready to turn or serve and was incredibly polite (and tolerant of all our dumb questions).

We sat in a private booth, which was a nice touch (private in view only, not sound! Sorry children that were in the restaurant...)

It's pricier than other places in the area, but the food was delicious, the atmosphere is comfortable and nicer than most places in the area and the service was top notch. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some bbq kalbi.  Food was decent, not great.  Kalbi-it's all about the marinade and quality of the meat. Not amazing here, but good.  Service was weak though."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Prices are a little high than what I'm used to but the service is amazing! The employees are friendly and they really do care about your satisfaction of their food. Side dishes are delicious. Their hot stone bowls are very good. I would come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The sides were delicious. My friend got the Beef and Kimchi stone bowl and she was still talking about it wistfully a week later. Word for word \"that shit was delicious.\" 

We were in Toronto for a weekend and it was the best place we went to. I got the egg drop soup, and it was the blandest thing I've ever had in my life. But that's alright, everything else was good!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I got great service. My server was very friendly. The second time I went there, I waited for 20 minutes to order my food. I had to cook my own bbq meat this time, which was surprising. The food has also gotten pricier. I don't think I'll be coming back here. I recommend going to Hankang, much better service."}
{"text":"Nice decor and more spacious compared to the other restaurants in Koreatown. Service is extremely fast. I ordered the vegetable bibam bap and my boyfriend ordered beef bulgogi. Both were okay, similar to everywhere else, but I think I'd rather have the same food at a significantly cheaper place just steps away."}
{"text":"I still love this place!!  We had jajang myun  (Black soy bean sauce on noodles) and eel on rice and a spicy tuna roll.  They give you a generous variety of banchan.  The son (at least I think he is as he refers to his mom) is friendly and helpful.

The food is always good but I I think the place is overdue for a Reno as the carpet is worn and the decor is dated.  It is a popular place for large groups and those who like good korean food."}
{"text":"Great good quality Korean BBQ option. The meat and seafood were all of good cuts and quality. I personally prefer cooking my own food on the grill, as part of the novelty/privacy factor, which wasn't how its done here. However, the meal was still very enjoyable."}
{"text":"We had a party of 8 and our server was so kind to give us two plates of mandoo on the house. Went during lunch and took advantage of their lunch specials and The prices for their lunch specials is around $10-12. Their portions are more than decent."}
{"text":"Expensive compared to other restaurants in Koreatown. Didn't find food to be that good.

Tried the fried dumplings, kalbi beef ($24.99), beef bi bim bap, fish stew, and pork bone soup. Each of these dishes was at minimum $10. And they came with a side of white rice (not the purple).

The shared dishes included fish cake, bean sprouts, pickled cucumber, and kimchi. Kimchi dish only had the hard part of the cabbage (no leafy parts).

Overall, I wasn't that impressed by the quality of food or service here, and to add to that, the price point was high. I don't plan on coming back here for korean food."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Solid Korean food. Had Kalbi lunch box but was slightly raw. It could have stayed on the grill another 3 minutes."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant I've eaten at! Spacious and inviting space, excellent food and wonderful customer service. The place has a homey and cozy vibe, and is a family owned business. The server, Jay, is so passionate and friendly - getting to know the guests and catering to their culinary needs. I would definitely come back another time and I would bring large groups here. Love, love, love. MAD TIPS."}
{"text":"Ended up here because the other Korean BBQ place we wanted seems to have shut down.  When you walk in, there are numerous pics of celebrities who have visited over the years.  We were seated at the back of the restaurant and there was quite the clutter of items (broken screen, boxes, etc) piled next to our table which was a bit odd.  I'm not sure why this wouldn't have been placed in the back out of sight of the customers.  We were disappointed to find out they don't have any AYCE BBQ so we just ordered other dishes.  The portion sizes were reasonable but the service was a bit slow.  We didn't get our appetizers for a while and it's not like other Korean places that provide you unlimited side dishes of kimchi, etc.  

We ordered the bulgogi kimchi dolsot bibimbap which was impressive.  The pork katsu curry was ok but nothing spectacular.  The seafood soup was a bit too spicy for my friend but at least it had some kick to it.  Overall, it's ok but I prefer Korean BBQ where you have the option of unlimited meat and sides."}
{"text":"I wish you could give 4.5 stars - It's a solid spot for a filling dinner. 

The food is a solid selection of Korean dishes, sushi, etc. The dishes come with appetizers that are included in the meal and are very tasty in their own right - the fish cakes especially.

But the reason I am giving the place 5 stars is because of the hospitality shown by the owners son, who came and gave me an extra plate of fish cakes just because I told them I liked them a lot!

After he saw that I was just eating the meat out of my Chicken Udon, he went back to the kitchen and got me a plate of beef, also on the house. 

Im sure he isn't doing this for every person, every night, etc. But because of his generosity, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good although the pricing is on the high side. Had the cold noodle, beef katsu and Korean pancake.

The cold noodle was not bad, although you had to add the vinegar yourself. But it was very refreshing and authentic. Best cold noodle stills goes to Cho Sun Ok.

My bf had the beef katsu and it was pretty good as well, portions were large.

Best thing had to be the Korean pancake, was really crispy and each piece was big.

Portion wise I felt they were generous, but pricing is def more than other places and service was so-so."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant on a Friday night , restaurant was full but they managed to get a table for 3 of us right away.

Parked at the nearby Green P for $6.00


Ordered table top cooking - minimal 2 orders we tried 1) spicy pork belly 2) bulgogi beef.  Meat was tender and good portion, Nicely Marinated. Served with a free basket of lettuce to make your own meat wrap.

Side dished were really favourable, we ask for refills with no issues at all. Kimchi was really tasteful and no overly spicy.

This is a family restaurant with Great service!!  You were acknowledged by all staffs and great smiles by every server.  They love their job. 

Also Amazing was free Fried dumpling and chocolate ice- cream , was on the house !!
Can't believe that


We will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Food is what you would expect from an average Korean restaurant. Spicy rice cakes are the usual but good. Not a fan of their Korean bbq. Waaayyyy overpriced! You get a small amount of ONE kind of protein for like $30 bucks. Then they hover over your table to cook it for you...very odd. Manager is nice however. Might return but doesn't beat many other Korean restaurants in this city."}
{"text":"This place is great for a very large group [came here with a group of 25]; perhaps the edge they have over other the other Korean restaurants in the area.  They are also very efficient in serving such large numbers, bringing dishes in a timely matter.  So you don't have to worry that one side of the table will be done their food before the other receives their food.  

However, my experiences eating here in smaller groups (2-4) have been sub-par.  It almost makes me question if I was eating in the same establishment!  The service was much slower, especially getting the bill.  The food lacked in presentation, and was either too salty or bland.

Verdict: Very accommodating and attentive to large parties.  Not worth it otherwise."}
{"text":"Let's see here, where should I start?

First off, if I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would. I mean, I understand that there sometimes should be separate stars for food and service haha, just as a warning to people that the food may be okay, but the people you're trusting to bring it to you may not want to be nice to you in any way - and possibly go out of their way to be mean to you lol (ahem, What-A-Bagel at 9330 Bathurst Street and Mezza Notte near the CIBC on Yonge - YES JASON, WE REMEMBER YOU), but here, I think I would do 4 stars for the food and a gazillion stars for the service (and that averages out to something pretty high, right? haha)

Anyway, I've been here twice. Once for my sister's birthday (Jan 2012) and once with a small group of friends (Feb 2013)

The first time, it was amazing. We got in a bit before rush-hour dinner; there were lots of tables, so a reservation wasn't needed (fyi, i think this was a weekend too!)

We ordered sauce noodles, chicken bibimbap and japchae. i think i also ordered manduk too hahaha (we were really hungry...at that time, there was no spicy rice cakes, otherwise we probably would've gotten that too!) Good thing there wasn't, because between the 4 of us, it was a lot! We couldn't finish the noodles. everything was super yummy!! (esp the spicy chicken bibimbap :D)

While we were eating, our server was actually (i'm going out on a limb here bc i'm not korean and i don't understand korean BUT the relationship between the server and the person im assuming is the owner was really familial) THE SON of the owner dun dun dun. 

He was always refilling our banchon and anytime we needed something, he was there with a concerned/friendly look on his face, ready to help. He heard me sneezing? Came by with extra napkins. He overheard my friend saying she loved a particular side dish? Brings a new one and takes away the finished one almost immediately. 

What really made it special for my sister, was that he overheard us talking about how it was her bday so she shouldn't have to pay. He came over to collect the bill from us, and do you know what he did? He gave us a tray of frozen mochi balls.

\"Dessert, to celebrate your birthday!\" he says to my sister.

Let's just say we were floored. She's in hospitality and tourism, so she was like thumbs-upping this place vigorously haha

You'd think that was it, right? When we finished the mochi balls, he came by with another tray (the regular one, i'm guessing, bc we got this one the second time too) the one with the lollipops!

I immediately grabbed the green one, and there were only 3 left: 2 red and one blue.

Everyone complained that they wanted the green one; you know, in the dang, i wanted that one, but i'll settle for x-one.

He comes by the table with 3 more green ones. 

now, there's a way to do all the things he did and say all things he said in a creepy way. but he just does it in a proper, i'm your server, please have a wonderful meal kind of way. I think that's what's so amazing.

the second time i came, i had made reservations bc 10 of my friends said they would come. Half an hour before the appointed time, about 5 people cancelled. I felt bad because they had prepared a beautiful private room for us.

I told him and he was like ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM, LET ME SET YOU GUYS UP IN A SMALLER ROOM. and he took us to another private room. service and food were great --- and now they've added dukbokki so everything is good in the world.

and seriously. he's just so wonderful lol

definitely go there!! :D"}
{"text":"Not AYCE. 

I give this a three despite the food being pretty good. Nothing to blow me away but good all round bbq! Anytime I get shown to a back corner beside a dissused player piano and a hoarders booth of distruitus I'm going to knock a star off, especially as the restaurant was half empty on a Tuesday in the summer. 
Now to the meat of the review, had the pork belly and sirloin bbq at the table with the accoutrements. 
I would skip the pork belly as it was $20.99 for as much as I buy of the stuff for $2 at no frills. Really you are paying for the wonderful little bbq experience.  The sirloin was lovely! Well prepared and seasoned for cooking at the table. There was a distinctive thick paste for the pork belly that did set the whole dish off in the best way! 

I guess I wish they had a mixed platter of meat and veggies to grill for two people or something to have a little more fun. 

Go here and don't expect to be blown away but it's okay service and good food for a constrained but vast menu.

Just don't be baby in the corner :')"}
{"text":"Officially one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. Went there at the weekend for a friend's birthday. One of my friend's has eaten here a few times and had commented that the owner's son knows all his regular customers by name...and he does!

The service was amazing, we were given dumplings, kimchi, cucumber, bean sprouts and fish cake side dishes which were amazing. Because I said I love kimchi they just kept bringing out more, we even tried the experimental kimchi that the owner had been making.

I ordered the pork bone soup...I am struggling to see past this dish. I have had it here once before and it is simply delicious. Some like it hot, I like it hotter so I had to add chilli sauce! However a number of our group also had the soup and said it was hot enough for them. Next time I go, and there will most definitely be a next time, I am going to have something different. 

I cannot praise this restaurant enough! Great food, reasonable priced and fantastic service has always been my experience."}
{"text":"First off, the comments about the owners son... ALL TRUE.  He really is an amazing server and very attentive and friendly. I'll tell you how I know this.

Went in here a few weeks ago for Bi Bim Bap and a beer.  We ordered, and they brought all the little delicious sides like they usually do. (I've been here before, but for the korean AYCE grill, never ordered off the menu though).  As usual, we ate up all the little sides while we waited for our dinner.

Beer came quick, and the servers came back repeatedly, asking if we needed anything else. HUGE points. They were always smiling too.

I ate up all of this one particular side.. I couldn't place what it was. Tofu maybe? I asked the server. Fish cakes!!! Ahhhh, yes.. so yummy! I told her they were delicious and I love them and thanks for bringing them.  Dinner came, we ate in silence as it was so delicious and exactly what we were craving.

Bam! More fish cakes came to the table! Another server brought them over, and smiled as she gave them to us.  I thanked her repeatedly. I was really over the top happy about these darn fish cakes.

The owners son comes by, says Hi, walks by.. and on his way back I say... \"These fishcakes are delicious. Can you tell me how they're made?\" He goes on to tell us that his mom makes them, and everything is done in-house. I say wow, they're great, and thanks for everything tonight. Serivce and food has been fantastic.

We pay and are just about ready to go, and BAM! A container of fish cakes is on the table.  The owners son says, ' you know what they say.. .never leave home without your fish cakes!'.

Awesommmmmmmee. Happy girl here.  I cooked some rice the next day, added kimchee and the fish cakes and had that for dinner. I can't wait to go back to Korean Villiage. Everything about it ROCKS."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I've lived in LA for the past 13 years and so I have a very high standard when it comes to Korean food as I believe it's the best in the world (including Korean food in Korea).

I had low expectations going into this place and I was not disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the service was great. The manager (or owner) went around and greeted the customers and even had a friendly chat with them and would also help serve the food so for that I give them props, but as far as how the food tasted, to me, it's more for non-Koreans (aka white people). I'm not racist (ok maybe a little) but I've noticed the great Korean food spots have little or no non-Koreans and the restaurant looks like shit on the outside and in. The restaurants that have a nicer interior and better service is meant to cater to a different crowd.

So... if you're white, you'll like this place, otherwise, I'd avoid eating Korean food in general in Toronto as I've yet to find one that I enjoyed.

Also, parking is absolutely horrible. You will have to pay for parking. Either sell your soul to the devil and find one on the street or pay a few extra dollars to park in a sketchy lot across the street.

Parking: Limited metered street or paid parking lot
Price: $8-$15 per person
Wait: 5-10 mins"}
{"text":"Me and my friends were going there for dinner, with all the good reviews, i was expecting alot, but we were dissapointed. We ordered the korean bbq which was very good. The older lady serving us was very nice and friendly and took care of our food efficiently. She helped us grill the meat too and made great suggestions. I also liked how they give you lettuce as a side dish. Overall the food was very good, but the kimichi had a bitter taste, but im sure others liked it, i personally prefer korean grill's kimichi. Anyway in the end, we weren't happy with the young girls working at the cashier. Btw you have to give them 13% tip in the end, which we didnt know. The two girls working rudely raised their voice at us telling us to pay 15$ extra as tip. With their strong accents, we couldnt understand them properly, so then they gave us unpleasent looks. They started talking in their language and was giving us attitude, one of the girls threw our money on the desk telling us to give them more. We ended up giving the tip but only because the older lady serving us came and told us we didnt have too and she was very polite. If it wasnt for her, i'd give this a one star. My friends and i were very displeased with the way the cashiers talked to us. Honestly we were mad and i'd never come here again. The food was good, well all types of meat is always good, but there are many other places with better. 1 star for food, 2 for the older lady serving us."}
{"text":"Not bad... would have given more stars if they didn't use the tongs to pick up the raw meat and serve the cooked food.  Be glad not to get food poisoning tonight. And way too much MSG..."}
{"text":"I came to visit Toronto, and a local friend said to me, \"I'm going to give you two options: the BEST Korean restaurant in Toronto, which is a 3.5km walk, or the SECOND best Korean restaurant in Toronto, which is only a kilometer\".

I opted for the best Korean restaurant, and we walked to this restaurant in the bitter cold. It was absolutely, without question, worth the walk.

This is probably the most personable service I've ever had in a restaurant. The owner's son served us and he was extraordinarily friendly, polite, knowledgeable, and entertaining. Truly world-class service. When we ordered, he complimented us on the \"authenticity\" of our order and asked how much time we had spent in Korea (answer: none, but I've got good friends who are Korean and who have taught me a lot about the food). The food came out almost immediately, and it was spectacularly plated and presented.

The rice cake appetizer was perfect, the Octopus Bokum was wonderful and plentiful, and  the banchan was all delicious.

He came by and asked me if I wanted a cup of his mom's homemade Miso soup, on the house. He was proud of the recipe his mother used.

His extraordinary friendliness didn't extend just to us because we ordered \"authentic\", either. He was bantering and impressing every other guest in the place, to the point where myself and my dining companion both were in awe of how smooth this guy was.

The dinner prices were slightly higher than I was expecting, but honestly, the food and service were so good that it didn't even matter.

The next time I'm in Toronto and I want to take someone to \"the Best Korean Restaurant, no seriously, I mean it\", I am coming right back to Korean Village."}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  One of the best pork bone soup in Calgary and rice in stone bowl.  Love their brown rice."}
{"text":"The service here was really good. The owner's son was warm and friendly to everyone. The food was pretty good as well. The BBQ meat was very good quality and well marinated, but slightly pricy."}
{"text":"Jason, the son of the current owners, really knows the meaning of true customer service that complimented beautiful food. Keep up the great work and it definitely made the experience so much better!"}
{"text":"Bulgogi dinner is fantastic. Service was great. Perhaps my favorite Korean restaurant now!"}
{"text":"As others have said, the owner's son is AMAZING! I had family in from out of town with their four (!!!) small kids and the service couldn't have been more patient and sweet. We let our server choose our menu and we weren't disappointed. The tempura was the freshest I've ever had. 

I'm five months pregnant and sometimes think I'll never feel full but I was so satiated at the end of this meal. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times now and as everyone knows, it's one of the most popular Korean places in downtown. Just because this is the most popular place does not mean it's the best Korean food in the city (which many people seem to assume).

Food: I've had their gamjatang which is great, good size for the price. I've also had their naengmyun which is not my favorite. The noodles were too chewy and al dente which is odd for Korean noodles. The spicy sauce is decent and the first time I had it their ice was in chunks which wasn't pleasant. However the second time it was more slushy and blended well with the sauce. Next I've tried their Jampong which I thought lacked dimension in flavor and was just salty. Portion sizes were very generous however. We also tried their kalbi which was very good but pricey. Finally the Kampungi was decent and again great portion size. We have not tried the BBQ here but it is pricey on the menu and I would recommend going elsewhere for BBQ.

Service: I can't say enough about their great service, and I think this is the highlight of this restaurant. The servers are all very friendly and easily accessible (even on a Saturday evening). The manager's son (didn't catch his name) is probably the best server I've ever encountered. He makes sure everything is in order for you and responds lightning fast with anything you need. Last time I was there he insisted on giving us complimentary rice and extra Kampunggi (claiming he thought the portion wasn't big enough!). I would definitely recommend speaking to him if you are there and he will make your meal very entertaining and satisfying.

Drinks: We don't usually order anything to drink here, the drinks are quite pricey.

In conclusion, their food is decent, great portion sizes, some can be pricey, but they have the best service I have experienced in a Korean restaurant. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service is good and relatively speedy.

The side dishes were not replenished. 

The food itself is pretty good. Interestingly the sushi was actually very good. It's a bit pricey but overall a fine place to have Korean or even Japanese food."}
{"text":"This place is packed on a Saturday night and smells delish right when you walk in. 

First thing you'll notice is the million photos of the owner with celebrities from all over the world. Which boosts their popularity. And the cute traditional Korean decorations which I think it made it look too cluttered...

The kgrill was good. The grill is a portable one and not in the table like other restaurants. Be prepared to smell like the yummy meat since they don't have the individual ventilation for each table. They put the meat on the grill for you and check back to refill. The food was enjoyable

Service can be improved on but I think they were just short staffed. I can't really complain since they were attentive to grilling our meats :)"}
{"text":"Awesome experience today with my Grandson.  Food was delicious but what made it even more special was the owner's son (I believe his name was Jay) as he visited our table and wax so informative and helpful.  Will definitely go back..."}
{"text":"My friends and I dropped by Korean Village for dinner on Saturday night around 7:30pm. There was a big line-up and we waited for about 15-20 minutes (3 of us). I had never been here but the two of them had so I knew we were in for a treat if they wanted to return.

Once seated, the waitress was quick to bring us menu and ask what we wanted for drinks. We ordered their lemon soju and a bottle of the grapefruit soju as well. The lemon soju was my favourite, it tastes very similar to fresca (maybe that's their secret?!) and it was light and bubbly. The grapefruit soju was stronger, but still very enjoyable. 

I ordered the Jap Chae Bap, and my friends had bulgogi and spicy pork bibimbap. My plate arrived first, my friends waited another 5 minutes to get theirs. We munched on the Korean side dishes in the mean time. I didn't care for the kimchi (it's very rare I dislike kimchi), it was very sour, too sour for any of our liking. 

I enjoyed my entrée, it was the perfect portion and everything tasted great. We had fun sharing the soju and had a good time overall.

My only complaint is that as the night went on, the waiters disappeared. We never got our check, so we ended up going to the front counter to ask for it.

I enjoyed our dinner here, and while there weren't any major red flags for this restaurant, I don't think I would return. Only because there are other Korean restaurants I previously enjoyed more in KTown Toronto."}
{"text":"Food is slightly above average, but the quality is amazing. Had the Bi Bim Bap served cold, but wasn't sure if a portion of it was supposed to have ice in it (tasted a bit weird).

Overall, enjoyed it. Would come again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Brought my YEA for their first authentic KBBQ experience and it was a very satisfying experience!

So, I was fully expecting (and ready) to do the cooking but was pleasantly surprised but appreciative that they would cook the plates of raw food on your behalf.

We ordered a plate of the pork belly and kalbi and the service staff were attentive in dropping by our table to cook the pieces to our delicious satisfaction.  There were plenty of banchan, sliced raw garlic, lettuce, and korean bbq sauce to create a yummy package to nom.

The KBBQ smoke will seep into your clothes after the meal so don't eat this if you are going elsewhere later in the evening that would make other people drool in hunger.

Fact-That-May-Only-Interest-Me: I guess in Korean culture women don't normally eat sliced raw garlic with their KBBQ so they a little taken aback when both of us dug into them."}
{"text":"This place is busy.  So best to call ahead.  We may had waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2.  We had Jay(the son of the owner) as our waiter and he IS quite chatty as other people have mentioned and he does give people extra stuff for free.  It was also his birthday (Jan 10th).  At one point in our night, these random girls came in looking for donations and went to table to table.  Which is a bit odd and I'm surprised that the owners allowed this.  We got the BBQ at our table.  #1 and #2.  Delish.  Jay said that Nelly Furtado and Susur Less ordered these.  5 smaller side dishes, soup, side of lettuce wraps and a plate full of meat.  You will get the side dishes first so best to wait until the food comes so you can include these in your lettuce wraps.  They make their own kimchi. They gave us these bean sauce too which was quid yummy.  We did order tea and we did NOT get billed for this.  There are private rooms at this restaurant so it would be a great place for a group/event."}
{"text":"the amount and the quality of the food is perfect!
noodles, rice and rolls are amazing!
the owner is helpful and kind...we will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service that our family has received EVER. That is the only reason why this rating is so low. Took forever for someone to take our orders and no one stopped by our table after our food was dropped off. Our table was filled with empty and dirty dishes that were never cleared. Food was alright but the terrible service made our meal more about trying to flag down our server and any staff in the vicinity rather than focusing on enjoying our food."}
{"text":"Awesome Yelp reviews led me here! Having had THE best Korean food in the DC area, I was hesitant to try any here in Toronto. But the rave reviews led 6 of us here, excited to dig in! All, (but one), were first timers here!

Apparently, the \"Pork Bone Soup\" is all the rave in Toronto. I didn't know that! So I just HAD to try it for myself! 

While we were waiting, the food bloggers at the table were taking photos of the menus. We joked that when the food came out, what was on the menu won't match the actual dish! ... We spoke too soon! ... 

The menu showed the Pork Bone Soup with green veggies & all sorts of other veggies. But then my soup arrived, and it looked boring as bread. 

The soup base was bland, so not very flavourful. It was filled with bean sprouts and onions, and 2 large chunks of pork bones, which were pretty tender and juicy. The soup came with rice, which normally I love having with soup, but the broth was so, unflavourful, I was afraid the rice would soak up what was left of the flavour. Decent size bowl for $9.99. It was filling, but not satisfying. One friend asked me what I thought of the soup. My response? \"It's an acquired taste\"; the more I ate it, the more I liked it. 

The pork dumplings had a crispy, firm bite, with an iiiitty biiiitty piece of pork filling in each. $10 for 8 pieces. Good, but I have had better. 

Service is random. The host ad waitress are very friendly and efficient in getting you seated. However, placing the order took forever and a day! We were in one of the private rooms. Having never been here, we waited, and waited. No service. Not even a peep! Until someone at our table spotted a service bell on the wall!  DUH! They should really explain that to everyone who comes here! 

But once we ordered, the food all came rather swiftly! We probably only waited 10 minutes and everyone had their entres!  We were impressed! Everyone who got the Bololgi or Galbi dinner polished theirs off. Damn them! The portions are great! You won't leave hungry here! I know I'll be back. I won't get the soup again, but I will be back for Bolgolgi or Galbi!

Interestingly, when we got the bill, it was in KOREAN! Another first!"}
{"text":"I've seen this large restaurant more than several times because I frequent Korea town A LOT! I never go in because based on my experiences in South Korea, the smaller and dingier the restaurant the more mom and pop home cooking you'll get.

Recently my close expat friend who I met in SK was flying to Saskatchewan for training and would be gone for at least 6 months. So we all met up at Christie station and Korean Village was one of the choices I offered them based on the ratings on yelp. My friend of the hour picked it because of the bbq which I also sometimes avoid in canada due to the difference in serving it. 

We walked in to look at their menu and this nice gentleman comes over to give us some menus and also says he hopes we'll stay for dinner. Locked in: because that we decided to stay. 

Best decision ever made!!! The gentleman's name is Jason and he is 75% the reason for the 5* rating... the other 75% is the food of course. (Yes, I'm fully aware that makes 150% ^_^) He is the owner's son and even introduced us to his mother at the end of our meal.

He was attentive, friendly and joking with us the whole meal. I'm not sure if he does this with a lot of customers but it sure made us feel special. Some of our group learned Korean (Hanguel) in Korea so he made it a point to chat with us in Korean. He came out with extra panchan that we had yet to see on any table in Canada. Gave us an extra plate of mandu (fried dumplings) free tastes great but those mandus were definitely delicious! 

The bbq/pork bone soup and korean pancake we got were all delicious. The pancake wasn't too doughy and had a lot of ingredients fried into the crispy goodness. The lettuce wrap and garlic that accompanied our meat made me smile. Too many chinese copy cats in the city. 

At the end of the 2 hour meal, Jason came by with some bags of loose leaf korean teas for my friend who was leaving and soju shot glasses for all 4 of us. He was so happy, I can't help but even smile now while writing this. He definitely made my day, dining experience and probably week. He remembered our names through out the entire meal. 

Best part is that last week I was talking to my best friend's parents about this place and they had the same experience of friendliness more than a year ago! What a great neighborhood based restaurant with service you rarely see nowadays. No wonder it was crazy busy on a weekday!

The menu is vast and you'll find a lot of different types of Korean cuisine on the menu. I'll definitely go back for another meal soon :)"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and was craving Korean BBQ. This place is family style. Food arrived quickly and was pretty good. Side dishes were seldom in variety. We only received kimchi, been sprouts, pickled cucumber and spicy fish cakes. Seafood pancake could have been cooked alittle bit longer, the middle was a bit soggy. Spicy chicken bim min bop was very good. Bul go ki and pork belly were very good. Not salty at all. Only 2 things I'm annoyed are the lack of ventilation and service. As I'm typing this review, it's been 45 mins waiting for my check. Place has cleared out and we are one of the handful of tables left. Even asking for refill on the condiments was a struggle.  And lastly no fruits after this hearty meal.  Other than that, food was great and owner makes an effort to chat with repeat customers."}
{"text":"Service was nice, the food was good for the price it was worth. Just the decor threw me off as the entrance looks like a flower shop...but still recommend people to eat here."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service was just amazing. WE got a great table and free dumplings. The best part of the experience was Jason, he was extremely friendly and also made us try some delicious beef."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is phenomenal. The owner's son was incredibly friendly and made our visit one to remember. The jjajangmyung is the best I've ever had and I loved the fishcake banchan. The galbitang also deserves a mention and was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and doesn't taste as good as other average priced Korean restaurants. Specifically,the spicy chicken dish was a bit disappointing, fried but wasn't crispy. The same dish at Yummy a few doors down was much better. It was rather quiet for dinner considering all the good reviews it has in yelp, they were only almost half full on a Tue night dinner time. I wouldn't go back again because there are lots of other places that's tastier and cheaper for same type of food."}
{"text":"The amount and quality of banchan (side dishes/ appetizers) given was amazing, they were definitely not stingy and offered free refills. 

Remember to make reservations before you go, there was a line both when we entered the resturant( around 7 pm on a Sunday) and when we left (8:30 ish).

The food was very tasty, we ordered a variety of dishes from Bibimbap, to Beef Bulgogi, sushi, Spicy Iced Noodles, and Jjampong. 
The only complaint was for the Jjampong, there were a lot of empty shells in the soup. My friend cracked open 5 of the mussels in his soup, and 5/5 were empty. Lol we thought they added the shells in for decoration as opposed to flavour. 

Overall, it was an extremely filling meal, and the service was very prompt."}
{"text":"Korean Village is Brian S' go-to restaurant in Korean Town, so I have been a few times. We went back last night after a concert on Bloor Street at 11PM and had another great experience.

The staff is always friendly, and last night we had a fabulous waiter, who told us he is the owner's son. As a result, he knows the menu inside and out and very politely shared whatever information we needed. At the same time, he was unobtrusive and gave us peace. A very good server.

The menu is extensive: I have had the Korean barbecue there, but last night I was feeling a bit peckish, so I ordered some soup  - it was described as noodle soup with thin broth, seafood and vegetables. Brian ordered a sashimi dish that he'd never had before. 

Seconds after ordered, drinks and kimchi and other small plates arrived. Peckishness gone! Turned out it was a need to eat after 12 hours of nothing but chips. The rest of the food was MASSIVE portions and so good. I loved the soup ($8 by the way!) - chunks of scallop and shellfish in a giant broth with lots of noodles. BrianS has a new favorite dish - we called it the Sashimi salad. It had huge pieces of raw fish on a bed of lettuce and other shredded veggies. It was on the same page as the sushi and chirashi, if you want to check it out.

I can't believe no one has reviewed this restaurant. Great location, super staff, and it's big so even though it's popular, I have never waited to sit."}
{"text":"We came here based on the Yelp reviews and that it was spacious, not like the other small Korean restaurants around that were packed and had no AC. Everything we ordered here was delicious! They were all fresh, tasty and nicely sized in portions. I love a place that serves both Korean food and sushi and one in which one type is not better than the other. I've always had this struggle as my boyfriend doesn't like sushi but absolutely loves Korean, where as I'm just a sushi addict.
Most often it would be that the restaurants lacked quality in their sushi and not in their Korean. My boyfriend and I can finally compromise between the two and just come here! My favourite dish was the ja ja myun with the fried egg. It was not like other black bean noodles, as the sauce was not thick and heavy in a black bean taste. It tasted very light and had like a wok taste to it - you can tell that the sauce and ingredients were fried really well and not just sitting in a pot waiting to be served on a bed of noodles. The pork bone soup was also tasty and the sushi was decent. Their prices for each item was $3-$4 dollar more for each item (besides the sushi), but it was definitely worth the quality of their food and complimentary Korean apps."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom today around 1. there was a few people already there, but no where near a full house. The food was amazing, I've never had Korean food before so we asked our waitress. she was so sweet and went through the menu with us recommending certain things bass on our individual taste. The bill came to $30 and it was worth every penny! 
I would highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Food is nothing special, service was not good, I ordered Korean noodles, pork bone soup, it was below average, and the cashier even demand me for more tips after I gave plenty enough tips, I have never had experience like this. I won't be back, and I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I had the spicy bulgogi combo. Everything was amazing. The kimchi is made in-house and tastes just like the kimchi in Korea. Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"It's funny.  The mediocre reviews here are generally \"good food, not so great service.\"  My experience was the opposite.  Service was fast and friendly.  And the food was good, but not great.  We had the spicy chicken bibimbap and the seafood pizza (pancake).  Both were good, but both really skimped on their main ingredients.  Looking for the chicken was like looking for a needle in a haystack.  Very little.  Same with the seafood in the pizza.  It was tasty, but almost no seafood.  I liked the atmosphere and the service was just fine, but I hate it when a restaurant \"cheaps out\" on its dishes."}
{"text":"It's a traditional Korean restaurant, pricier than your typical Korean place, but it feels more authentic and service was amazing - staff were all very friendly and helpful. Their Korean BBQ is pricey, but looked very delicious, while their other dishes were large in portion size but just tasted okay, not mindblowing. The side dishes they brought out though were excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party with a large group of around 20 people. 

Initially they gave us trouble told us that they were busy and cannot give us individual cheques. We told them most of us had cards and don't see each other making it hard to pay each other back. Then after much back and forth they agreed to it. (but in the ended they still put 6 people on a bill)

My negative sentiments towards the service redeemed a little when they offered us three plates of dumplings on the house. It was kind gesture after realizing there was a birthday boy at the table.

The service I would describe as tough love. Harsh but served with kindness. They drop and push food around on the table but hey at least it's fast.

I ordered the pork bone soup after reading many positive reviews about it but I didn't find it to be all that. The pork was on the dry side, the broth terribly bland and it was so expensive! $10.99. Okay well I guess $11 for a meal is generally cheap but I'm used to the $8 pork bone soups everywhere else. 

I can't eat very spicy so I usually tell the servers to make my soup mild but this time I forgot but it wasn't spicy at all (to my advantage. Don't expect this to pack heat if you're in the mood for spicy.

Their stone bowl bibimbaps are $16 -_- pretty ridiculous. I've never seen bimbimbaps for that much. You would expect it to be out of this world right? My friend admitted that his $8 bibimbap he had the day before from a sketchy looking shop he doesn't remember the name of was better.

Would only come back to try the BBQ, but it mstarts at $21/person for what looks like pretty a small portion...so actually probably won't come back."}
{"text":"[16/20]
The food was great and the restaurant was nice and clean.

(8/10) Food
The food was authentic and tasty! However it was quite expensive per person (~14) as the individual dinner meals were priced on the higher side. The serving sizes were generous tho, so it was worth it.

(5/5) Atmosphere
The restaurant was kept clean and organized. The decorations were on point and it was fairly quiet even as it got busy.

(3/5) Service 
The service was pretty good but we didn't get water or tea until we asked for it. The food came quickly tho and they were kind to us."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a long time, probably over the past 10 years at least and it started off as Dae Jang Geum.  Some minor changes since the previous owner but nothing major to note.

I love the Kim Chi, seafood pancake and bi bim bap.  The BBQ is good and tasty and the combination meals I find is more than enough to feed my family of 5.  I prefer they cook for us so we don't have to bbq it at the table and get all smokey.  The price of the BBQ is a bit high.  The rib is marinated really nicely, tender and flavourful.  The seafood pancake is a combination of crunchy, slightly chewy and with the dipping sauce slightly salty.  The bi bim bap has that crunch with the rice at the bottom of the stone pot and lots of julienned vegetables.  I really like the assortment of side dishes but they always have the Kim Chi, pickled daikon and blanched bean sprouts.  The jalapenos with wasabi sauce is good too.

Service for us is always good as they recognize us but it can get busy especially at dinner time on the weekend."}
{"text":"Ive never had Korean BBQ  before but I imagine this is what amazing korean bbq tastes like. This restaurant gets 5 stars for the food and the service. We weren't sure if to eat here but were talked into it by a guy who was leaving and told us this is his favorite Korean place the food and the service. And he wasn't lying. The owners son is the nicest person. Extremely attentive and friendly he honestly makes this place what it is. He served us coconut ice cream on the house because we told him we were visiting Toronto and he wanted to make our time extra special. GO GO GO !"}
{"text":"My Korean friend took me here once, and I am totally in love with their pork bone soup!!! And all the side dishes... they are all so yummy and you can ask for more with free charge!"}
{"text":"It was awesome food.  The service was amazing.  Jay should run for mayor.  Pork belly was phenomenal.  Best Korean BBQ yet for this family."}
{"text":"Jason is amazing! Very informative! Made our experience a personal and fantastic one!
Hands down the best place in toronto!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  However, the price we paid was not worth it.  For the amount that we paid, I was not satisfied with the food, service or decor. Could've paid 15 to 20 dollars less for a similar meal at a different restaurant.  Overall, still a good place if you don't mind forking over extra cash"}
{"text":"I came here because it was still open while other Korean restaurants nearby were closing. Plus, it has decent ratings. I had high hopes since it's quite a spacious restaurant so I assumed it must be great for it to sustain such a big place. 

I came with a small group and we decided to share the large size of the assorted BBQ platter.

I absolutely love Korean BBQ especially the ones in Korea. However I am satisfied with selected restaurants in Toronto. I was hoping that this would become a new favorite restaurant for Korean BBQ but I was wrong. 

The meats were all very bland. I had to use a lot of sauce to get some flavor. Everything in the platter was mediocre and bland. It didn't have a Korean taste I was looking for. I felt like I was purchasing meat and eating it at home. But my goal of visiting Korean restaurants is to get that Korean marinate taste of BBQ meats. Everything was so bland and I was really disappointed. I will go to other restaurants for Korean BBQ. 

The service was okay. Nothing spectacular. The food was disappointing. I have no reason to come back when there's so many alternatives nearby."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Korean restaurant in town. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Before saying goodbye to Toronto, we decided to have Korean BBQ at Korean Village Restaurant in Koreatown. Outside of the restaurant, they had a yellow advertisement listing their Lunch Specials (including but not limited to LA Kalbi Lunch Box, Pork Bone Soup, Bulgogi Lunch, Chicken Teriyaki, Tonkatsu, Salmon Teriyaki, Sashimi, Sushi, and Shrimp Tempura).

This time, we opted out of ordering lunch specials. We shared Yaki Mandu, Jap Chae Bab, Kalbi and BulGoKi. The Yaki Mandu consisted of ten homemade deep fried dumplings filled with seasoned beef and vegetables. These flavorful dumplings had a thick skin but I liked how the skin was crispy. It was served with a ponzu  dipping sauce. The Jap Chae Bab consisted of stir fried Korean glass noodles with assorted vegetables including red bell peppers, spring onions, black fungus mushrooms, soybeans, carrots, and onions heavily tossed in sesame oil. In terms of Korean BBQ, they brought portable grills to the table. There was a minimum order of two meats so we ordered Kalbi and BulGoKi. The Kalbi consisted of marinated Korean boneless short ribs, while the BulGoKi consisted of sliced tender sirloin beef in Korean marinade. Both were quite delicious. My only complaints were three out of four of the banchans (e.g., zucchini, cabbage, and beancurd) were spicy and at the end of meal, there was no rice or yogurt dessert drink."}
{"text":"Wow! I had never been to a Korean restaurant before and was apprehensive at first. But my friend was helpful in explaining the different types of dishes.

The server came 2x before to take our order before I finally ready to order! I ordered a noodle soup with seafood. My friend kept reminding me there was sushi, knowing I love sushi. But every moment is an opportunity to create something new right? So I decided to order something  new and be prepared for the unexpected!

My soup was hot! Full of delicious seafood. Full of rice (?) noodles. Full of squash. It was delicious. I think it was supposed to be spicy but it was not hot enough for me. My friend ordered the Chirashi sushi dinner. We got some Korean side dishes. I tried all except the soybeans. Don't like that. I definitely loved the pickled cucumbers and cabbage and the mystery fish side dish. I wanted gyoza and unfortunately the closest was deep fried dumplings. Not the same.

But everything else was wonderful. It was a new experience and I was happy to co-create it with a friend."}
{"text":"Nice selection of side dishes and decent kalbi but didn't quite live up to the expectations I had after reading other yelp reviews. Everything was good but nothing was special.  It's a cute restaurant though and the service was ok though not outstanding. I enjoyed my meal there but probably would try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"We never got asked for any beverage not even tea or water after sitting down for 15mins. We had to ask if we could have something to drink. There were 5 servers working at the moment and it was only 5pm on a weekday! Our waiters never greeted us or tried to talk to us but they talked and greeted every single table besides us, i just it is because we are the only asians there and the rest were western people. Very bad experience! Food was more expensive than usual but definitely not worth the price they charge! NEVER going back again!!"}
{"text":"We had kimchi bulgigi bibmbop, spicy rice cake, deep fried dumplings and pork bones soup. Soup was kind of average but other food was good. But when we leave the table, the server yelled at other server 'Grab the money from table!!' It would be nice to say goodbye instead??"}
{"text":"Came here with friends, and I've heard lots of great things about this place.
We got a medium Korean BBQ plate to share - it was a fun experience.  And I have to say, the food tasted good, I enjoyed everything especially the bulgogi beef.

My big issue was that the young waiter kept adding the raw meat and fish right beside and on top of the cooked pieces.  That seems like a food safety and contamination problem to me.
I also thought the prices were a bit high."}
{"text":"One of the Best Korean BBQ in the area - I always order their medium plate mix with meat and seafood. Best Haedapbap and best jappong! Those are my go to meals! Jason is a superstar, he can greet you in so many languages and knows what you need without asking."}
{"text":"We came in a group of 12 on Sunday night, and were seated in the private room.

Pros: Food tasted decent and arrived in a reasonable 10 to 15 minutes.

Cons:
- Rude behaviour from the old lady waitress. Taking forever (easily 10 minutes) to call a waiter during the busy time at 8pm.
- That waitress telling us, before ordering, that they will not do separate bills per person due to busyness (almost every restaurant I go to will do it).
- That waitress taking one of our orders wrong, and when delivering the food she insisted that she got the right order.
- The bill with a gratuity applied (we seriously threatened to leave no tips). Handwritten receipt (Who doesn't use a point-of-sale system these days?).
- The food being on the expensive side; things in the $10 to $25 range here are about $6 to $15 at other Korean restaurants I've visited.

There are many other restaurants on the streat. Skip the drama and take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"5 star Korean BBQ !  Awesome service and the owners son visits your table to talk.   The meats are top quality and they even teach you how to properly cook the meat! 

Family run since the 70's. 

Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"A friend wanted bbq seafood so we came here.  Cost for 1 serving was $22 for seafood but it was mandatory to order another bbq item or else we couldn't have bbq seafood.  So we ordered the next cheapest $20 bbq item which was bulgogi (beef).   They brought us 6 ban-chan (korean side dishes), lettuce wraps, miso soup and rice.  Then they brought a portable gas stove to our table and started placing our marinaded raw items onto it.  Food tasted good and it was fun coming up with different items to place in our lettuce wraps.  I took away a star for small portion size considering the price and also waitress was slow on checking up on the stove so some items got overcooked."}
{"text":"THE BEST IN TORONTO!
Coming from upstate New York-
This was the best way to end a trip to Canada. 
The BBQ at the table meat special of bulgolgi, pork belly, seafood and kalbi (we requested to exchange the chicken for kalbi, best choice ever) was more than enough for 3 hungry people. All servers were more than helpful and accommodating. All meats and seafood were seasoned to perfection! 

The owner and her son, Jason, made the dining experience unlike any other. They made my family and I feel like we were at home by conversing with us and helping us cook the BBQ in an authentic, juicy manner. Everything was spectacular and I would recommend this to any and everyone. Best Korean food and dining experience I have had in Long while."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is inconsistent. Just ordered their supposably \"delicious\" seafood pancake. Gosh it was pretty much just dough with almost no seafood in it. Please fix it. It was not like this before! Don't think your customer is dumb and can't tell that you're cutting corners!!"}
{"text":"Just came back from Korean Village on a busy Saturday night there. This is my visit to this restaurant and will definitily come back. The service was outstanding and very attentive. Food quality was very good, Good value for the money. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My friend and I's favorite korean restaurant. Food is delicious. We love their pork bone soup and the barbecue. Their sushi unlike other places, is more filling less rice whereas many places are heavy on the rice. Jason is amazing. He treats everyone like royalty and is always willing to explain the dishes."}
{"text":"The seafood noodle is awesome! The taste of the meet is great. The lady helped us to cook the beef but she stuck the beef together"}
{"text":"Came here cause I was craving korean bbq. Got the Kalbi beef and chicken/mushrooms set. The ban chans can first, which were pretty big size, however, not the much assortment compared to other restos. It also said in the menu that they charge for any refills, which was unfortunate, with the high prices already.

The meat came and was good quality and marinade. The server puts the meat on bbq for you and comes by every so often to put more meat on it. The problem with them doing it is they want to cook all the meat as quickly as possible. Not sure how other korean bbq places do it, most I've been to just leave you the meat to do yourself. I know I could've just asked them to stop, but by the time they come by, pickup the tongs and start adding all the meat, it's almost too late. I'll note for next time though.

All to say, I don't need to be back and would rather checkout all the other high value korean establishments on bloor."}
{"text":"I've never been here although I lived on Ossington for a while. I usually preferred to go to smaller Korean places that people outside the neighborhood do not know. This one and Korean House one block west are the most well knows by non locals.  

Now that I live on the other side of town I decided to visit this place on a Monday after work. Who would have knees theirs would be a troupe of Korean kids in red uniforms taking up half the restaurant and bunch of families with kids. Didn't know this was a family restaurant. As an unmarried guy I avoid family restaurants like the plague. 

To add insult to injury - after waiting in line to be seated (on a Monday !!!) the girl at the counter had the face to ask me if I mind if she sits the family of five behind me first !!! Apparently the tables were big and she said since I am alone - I can wait ???!!! I told her yes I do mind and I was here first and should be seated first. She proceeded to sit the family behind me first completely ignoring me !!!

I don't like cooking my own food when I go out to eat so I ordered the pork bone soup, which is how you tell how good a Korean restaurant is. Unfortunately the Korean scout troupe was burning some very fatty cuts on the next table so the entire place stank of burned fat. The little Korean appetizers they bring before the meal wee nothing special, neither in flavor nor in freshness.  

The pork bone soup took a long while to come out. These soups are cooked over many hours on the previous day so that was very strange. The soup itself was very average. Not bad but far from great. It said on the menu it was spicy but no trace of spiciness could be felt. Adi at the bottom were Little Rocks or sand which could damage the teeth although not dangerous for your digestion.  Imonay which is two blocks west has much better pork soup. 

Three stars for food, one star for customer service = two stars."}
{"text":"Birthdays are best when there's Korean BBQ! Everyone's uber friendly here which is a huge plus, so thank you ajjumas!!!! 

Kalbi (3.5/5) - nothing special! Skippppp

Pork Belly (5/5) - okay I'm so samgyupsal (pork belly) biased! Loved it here, this was sooooo good. I got the not spicy one--next time I will definitely consider getting the other one

Kimchi Jeon (3.5/5) - just okay, I love when Jeon has a bite to it so this is just not my type of pancake

Mandu (3/5) - nahhhhhhh skip this one too, the filling is a bit on the nonexistent side--who likes practically empty dumplings?

Jjajangmyun (4.5/5) - real good!!! Get this! The noodles and sauce go well together and it's just super tasty 

Things that make this place stand out isn't really the food--while it's great and all it's really just grilled meat at the end of the day! What does make this place awesome is its service and the LETTUCE OMG I hate how other places skimp on the lettuce and leave you hanging you know what I mean? Then you gotta ask for more and feel bad about needing them greens but this place gives you what you need! 

Also it was my birthday and they gave me ice cream wrapped in mochi for freeeee yasssss"}
{"text":"Interesting interior and service wasn't too bad, water jugs got refilled on a timely basis... 

Had the Beef Bibimbap, kimchi pancake whilst others ordered the pork bone soup, beef soup

Opinions from the table agreed that the dishes looked good but fairly average compared to what we've had at other Korean restaurants (in Asia, Australia etc) 

Restaurant sits on Bloor st W amongst many many Korean restaurants, worth a try at least once!"}
{"text":"So the good thing was that they were able to accommodate us with having 12 people for our party that day. The owner's son was particularly very nice to us and joked around a lot; however, everyone else was kind of rude.

We ended up getting some random BBQ dishes (i.e. pork belly - which was great; bulgogi, - which was meh; and kalbi - kind of good). We also ended up getting the dakgangjeong, which filled me up while I was waiting for the BBQ. Also got the seafood pajeon, which was not bad either. However, was disappointed to see that there were a lot of typical Korean dishes that weren't there (e.g. budae-jigae). 

Otherwise, it was an okay experience, wasn't the most amazing thing."}
{"text":"Best korean bbq in Korean town, hands down! The owners son was amazing. He provided the best service I have seen in a while from a resturaunt. I ordered the galbi which was delicious. But my only complaint is that they don't change the hot pan and it would cause my meat to burn. Other than that it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Had our anniversary dinner, our first time with Korean BBQ!

Food was excellent - lemon soju is a revelation, we argued over whether the bulgogi or the short rib was best, and the fried dumplings were fantastic.

However, the real highlight has got to be the amazing experience provided by Jake - schmoozing like a pro, brought out lovely dessert and a digestive tea, and truly made us feel at home. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've never had any luck with restaurants at the Annex really, but this one's my new favorite. Probably the best Korean food in K-town! 

Exterior: evidently bigger and fancier than its Korean counterparts; appears upscale.

Interiors: not as upscale; surprising cozy and many booths - always a good thing! 

Crowd: young, old and celebrities apparently. They have a wall full of pictures of celeb attendees and it's kind of impressive. I spotted Jackie Chan and Nelly Futrado amongst hundred pics. 

Interesting Tidbit: It's a family owned restaurant. And the \"son\" knows how to say his p's and q's in different languages. Apparently, the restaurant attracts a fairly diverse crowd and his picked up some over the years. 

Son's Mum: She is really pretty. She had her hair up like the Asian ladies in Asian movies... It was the fobby kind of pretty. I felt like I was in Korea for a minute (never been).

Variety: Huge menu, Japanese and Korean, I believe. I think I spotted some Chinese items as well. My friends lamented that their food wasn't worth the money (around the $20 price point) but I ordered something a lot cheaper - \"Beef and Mushrooms\" for $10. It was exactly that, and DELISH; the beef was so tender and the whole dish in it's entirety was so flavorful.

Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"this is by far the best Korean bbq restaurant in the city! for once, a Korean bbq that is authentic and actually owned by a Korean family. 

the food is delicious. i was with a group of 8 and we ordered one of the larger platters. the quality of the meat was excellent, the side dishes were all great and the dessert was awesome.

the customer service was great too. it really has the family business type of atmosphere.

high recommended."}
{"text":"I live in the US, and I think this place has great Korean food for the Korean palate. I've been there four days in a row for lunch. Tried hot stone rice - dolsot bibimbop - compared to all the Korean restaurants in Los Angeles, it's comparable - tasty... But this is a simple dish, difficult to screw up. Tried two soups - yujgae jang (spicy beef soup) and galbi tang (beef rib soup) - both standards and flavorful. And I've also tried the Bibim naengmyun - pretty good, just a tad too sweet for me, but good. Can't complain. And similar to other Korean restaurants in Los Angeles, they bring you a selection of free side dishes - rashish kimchee, cabbage kimchee, parboiled marinated mung bean sprouts, and one other that seems to rotate. One day they served fish cakes which were very good. It's also authentic Korean food, meaning they are not making it so that it appeals to Caucasians palates - it's straight Korean. Whoever is cooking in the kitchen is doing a fine job. My husband is Caucasian, and I think he would definitely like the soups and the Galbi and spicy pork... I saw it being brought out...looked good. Why am I not giving it a 5?... I save that for my mom's Korean cooking. Also, the place is very private in that all the tables are enclosed with high walls, so you can't really tell how many people or who are dining there. Will definitely go back when I'm in Calgary next. I thought it was way better than Bulgogi Bowl on 17th which caters to a much more Caucasian clientele."}
{"text":"4-star for the atmosphere is no question! 

In terms of food, we ordered kalbi dinner, japchae with more veggies, and two pieces of tamagoyaki sushi. 

The kalbi was 3.4/5. Better than average restaurant and fair value for its price. Was hard to thru, but tasted not bad. 

The japchae was a good 3.6/5! Well, the glass noodle could've been more chewy, it was slightly thin and over cooked (?) but overall flavour was good. Not too oily or salty. 

The tamagoyaki sushi was just ok, 2.9/5. Restaurant average. I would've preferred if they just have a dish of tamagoyaki though. The combination with rice (sushi) is not very well balanced taste. 

Service was good though! We asked more veggies with the japchae as they don't have any stir-fry veggie dishes (understandable), and the server said she can ask the kitchen, and that's what we got!  Thx :)"}
{"text":"Food great . Service is a bit ehhhh . Might be the Language barrier but asked for less spicy and it seemed like they might have switched the request on my friends order cause her soup wasn't spicy but mine was soooo spicy . Didn't wanna send it back so asked for sugar and they asked why sugar said something like (again language barrier) maybe adding more broth or water if it too spicy but my point was adding water or broth would still have it spicy so I wanted sugar to like have it divert the spiciness you know what I mean ? But took three waiters staring at me asking why I need sugar like .... am I the weird one ? Idk but I mean if we just got my order right then this wouldn't be happening . Anyways it was too painful to eat and I left still hungry . Side dishes are good tho"}
{"text":"I was craving Korean food so I had to come to Koreatown. As a visitor from outside of Toronto, I am not used to the humidity. I wanted something super cold, yet spicy so I ordered spicy cold noodles, which was $10.99. Reasonably priced and the portions were great, as I couldn't finish the entire dish. The noodles were good, however the sauce I would say was missing something - it was spicy, yet a bit too sweet. I also expected more soup base, as I did not pick the option with just the spicy sauce, so that was a tiny bit disappointing. 

Overall, the service was great and food came out really quick (around 15 min wait?). I would come back again when I'm craving for Korean food!"}
{"text":"Came here for KBBQ with a buddy. Wasn't bad, but wasn't great. I keep hearing Toronto has excellent KBBQ but compared to Seattle and Los Angeles, I beg to disagree."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love!!

One of the best korean bbq in Toronto for sure. Not only was the resturants very nicely decorated, clean, and spacious, the staff was incredibly friendly that it makes you want to melt!

Now in regards to the food it was quite excellent. We tried the spicy pork belly and beef bulgogi. While the bulgogi was fantastic I felt that the pork belly lacked the spice."}
{"text":"If you ever travel to Toronto (or already live there), please eat at Korean Village Restaurant. Having lived in Korea for a year, I'm quite particular when it comes to Korean food. I don't claim to be an expert, I didn't grow up eating Korean food all the time, but what I can do is distinguish between quality Korean food and cheap, over-salted, crappy Korean food. The food at Korean Village Restaurant is quite simply, to die for. I had three different meat dishes (samgyeopsal, kalbi and bulgogi) and the Kalbi in particular was the best I've ever had.

What set this place apart, was not only the delicious food, but the amazing service. From the minute I entered Korean Village Restaurant, the owner's son treated my brother and I like members of the family. We were given multiple dishes on the house and I never had to wait more than a second before someone was ready to assist. It honestly felt like I had been graciously invited into someone's home. The son's mother, and holder of the delicious secret recipes, even came to say hello. My brother, who had never eaten Korean food in his life, claimed that this was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences he has ever had. Rest assured, when I move to Toronto, I will be frequenting this place often! Do yourself a favor, eat at Korean Village Restaurant, you won't regret it for a second."}
{"text":"Their food was good, but very over priced when it comes to their Korean BBQ. The service was good; in fact, the server actually cooked the meat for us. For the price of their food, I had expected more. Nothing outstanding, and could be found in other typical Korean restaurant, for probably at a lower price. Good note would be the variety of food."}
{"text":"I will probably never be back to Toronto, since I only came for a business trip. But if I ever do, my first and last stop will be here, in the best of the best. Quality? Check. Service? Check. Location? Check. Restaurant in sense of comfortable and cleanliness? Double check. We got almost one of everything at our table and NOTHING disappointed us. Has a very authentic taste and the owner and her son have the best customer service I've ever seen. He spent time at each table, cooking their bbq meat(which is self cook) and since he \"got a good vibe\" from us, we got a buttload of free desserts and snacks to try. He asked our waitress to get certain ingredients from the kitchen and started cooking some random fancied up version of bbq for us on our grill after asking if we wanted to try something new. AMAZING! And side note, it's a celebrity spot."}
{"text":"We had the Duk Bok Ki, and the Korean Bbq (Pork Belly, Bul Go Gi, and Chicken). Everything was delicious, and the owner's son spent a considerable amount of time showing us some pro-tips on how to get the best out of our BBQ. He even threw in extra rice and bean sprouts. 

We'll be coming back. Friendly atmosphere, great food, and an education to boot!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend, with high expectations because of all the reviews, but instead, the service just made us extremely uncomfortable.

Note: We're Chinese, and the servers were noticeably more accommodating to white and Korean customers.

We had two servers -- two older ladies. My boyfriend had to go to the washroom, so I looked over the menu alone. A middle-aged server lady came to take my order, and I asked for more time since my boyfriend hasn't even seen the menu yet. She was nice about it, but I caught her staring at me impatiently a couple of times from where she stood.

I hurried my boyfriend to make a decision as soon as he came back, because they were hovering by my shoulder, even though he just sat down. I tried to show him a menu item I thought he might like, but it was on a specials page that I didn't see was only available on Mondays-Fridays. The server gave me a sharp look, and immediately interrupted, \"No. Not today.\" Feeling really unwelcomed, we quickly ordered some kalbi (30.99) and pork belly (20.99) to barbeque, and some spicy rice cakes (10.99).

The one star is actually for the rice cakes. I liked them, but it's definitely not enough for us to ever come back here. The meat was okay -- nothing particularly special.

We took around 2-2.5 hours here, and they were undeniably rushing us out. I caught them giving us the same impatient look from where they stood, several times. We preferred to grill the meat ourselves, but they turned off our grill even though we still had meat cooking on it. Then they took our plate as soon as the last piece of meat was off the plate, and less than a minute after that, the check that we hadn't asked for yet was already dropped by on our table.

We usually tip around 50%, but this time, I didn't even want to tip at all. However, tipping isn't an option you can skip. The service tax added onto our bill. My boyfriend was extremely agitated and wanted to have a word with the servers, but I just paid quickly and got the hell out of there.

TL;DR: Never coming back."}
{"text":"Korean Village is a bit... odd. The decor is rather mismatched, but the restaurant is very spacious and service is quite prompt. There's a lot of autographs from famous folks as well, and the music they play is... country? I wouldn't have pegged this for an authentic Korean restaurant, but the staff is entirely Korean and the food is pretty good, so there you go. 

On a weekday night the place is kind of empty. You have to order 2 sets of BBQ plates if you want them, but you can order sushi, soup, rice without a minimum. We ordered some beer, two kinds of bbq meat, and some pork bone soup. It was quite filling for two people! You also get some vegetables to wrap your meat with.

You can always call for more side dishes, and no one rushed to force us out of the restaurant or anything. We took our time and had quite the enjoyable dinner. I would come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times (after a few failed attempts) and each time i've gone i've been happy. The food is really good - but don't go expecting student prices. You pay for the quality. The only reasons I wouldn't go more often are:

1) they aren't open late (e.g. 2am when i'm hungry looking for cheap korean food) and
2) It's a bit expensive (e.g. 2am when i'm hungry looking for cheap korean food)

This is the kinda place you take your parents to try Korean food. It's not ghetto like where youde go (Ok, it's just slightly ghetto)."}
{"text":"The space was quite nice, traditional decor and an authentic atmosphere. We ordered the Korean bbq which was an $88 platter with pork belly, beef, mussels, mushrooms, and squid. It was enough for three people. The beef was really good (I think marinated in bulgogi sauce), and the other meats were good too. The reason my rating is so low is because of the steep cost, and also I did not like how the waiters would come around and grill the meats for you. They would often put new raw meats on the grill, and then would touch the cooked meats with the same tongs. I personally like separating my utensils and not mixing raw and cooked foods (I'm not even a germophobe), so that bothered me, and I didn't like going home and worrying if I was going to get food poisoning. It was otherwise fine, but I wouldn't go back, and there are so many good Korean restaurants nearby (you're in Korea town) for the fraction of the cost!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had in Toronto....any one that wants to know what amazing service looks like should come here. Food is great and I felt like I was eating at a family members place....Jay and his mother are great people and truly made my father's birthday special. 

If your looking for Korean bbq or a restaurant with amazing service...this place is for you.

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Our Airbnb was in Koreatown, so it was impossible to walk past all these delicious looking restaurants every day without stopping in!  We very much enjoyed our meal - the kal bi was exceptional.  Tender, flavorful, so savory and delicious.  We were \"sharing it\" but I kept wanting to bogart this dish because it was so wonderful.  I was slightly underwhelmed by the spicy soup - can't find a menu online, don't know what it's called - as I didn't get much flavour from it.  My husband liked it more than me and thought it was quite spicy, but maybe I'm just comparing it to the beef, there was just a little bit less going on there.  But I'm not totally surprised - my favorite dishes when I used to work at a Korean restaurant were the bulgogi and kalbi.  Whatever they put in that beef marinade is unbelievable, don't miss it.  We also enjoyed the yummy, crisp, pungent banchan which make a great accompaniment to the meal.  We had no idea what most of them were, but some of the weirdest looking ones ended up being our favorites.  Great exposure to new tastes!"}
{"text":"Chow Yun Fat? Nelly Furtado? Jackie Chan!?

This place may have been graced by some of the world's finest.However, if this is the best Korean BBQ that Toronto can offer, then I am going to have to stay away from it the next time I come.

Okay, okay... admittedly, I am reviewing through the lends of an LA boy, where the heart of Korean food is located outside of Seoul. I found Korean Village Restaurant's food as standard and nothing mind blowing.Our servers were standard for any Korean joint (aka you need to be assertive to get orders). Below are some of my pluses and minuses for my first KBBQ in Toronto:

Some positives:
- Spacious and good for large groups
- Kalbi was decently good!
- Accommodating for individuals who have never had KBBQ

Things that irked me:
- Portion sizes were small for what you pay for here
- Banchan was limited, and no free refills (which is bizarre)
- Pork belly had an extremely salty seasoning- I wish there was no seasoning at all!
- Sesame sauce was way too salty
- No rice paper anywhere to wrap your meat with
- Miso soup was terrible

Overall, I was not very impressed with KVR. It may stem from my background with KBBQ in LA, but some aspects listed above really made the experience pretty mediocre compared to what I've had before. My recommendation would be to avoid the KBBQ and go for other dishes- or relocate to a location with more Koreans dining inside. It's usually a good sign!"}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday night, and the place was moderately busy, which is a great sign!

We immediately noticed the celebrity wall when we came in and same some familiar celebrities that have visited the restaurant (ex Sandra Oh). We were greeted by the friendly owner (I'm assuming) who is friendly but lack English prowess.

I ordered the standard pork bone soup, and it was very well seasoned, had a good serving size, and is reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend visiting this place if you are ever around the Bloor/Bathurst area!"}
{"text":"Soooooooo...

I gave this place 5 stars and loved it.  Until I got home and felt like I needed to hibernate for 8 months.  

I took a nap and crashed.  Woke up the next morning and had the WORST MSG headache I've ever had.  Dehydrated and a headache for most of the day.  My wife had the same symptoms. 

Too bad Korean Village.  Otherwise a great place but not worth needing to take a day off work."}
{"text":"They handled our group of 40 pretty well the one time we went for a coworker's birthday.  Showed us how to make lettuce wraps and handled the meat cooking for us. Great service and we had a great time!"}
{"text":"A place for non-Asian people...good dining environment and good services, but the food is not traditional Korean food.  

We ordered Pork bone soup and asked for mild, but it came up with clear soup base. Really?! Pork bone soup with clear soup base... we called our server and had it changed to Spicy, a few mins later they got us the same soup but with a bunch of spice on the top. Wow! We gave up and just had it cancelled and got the bill. 

Bottom line: if a Korean restaurant can't even cook a basic Korean dish that almost all the Korean restaurants can do a decent job at, it's not a Korean restaurant, but a restaurant wants to be called \"Korean\" restaurant. Nice try!"}
{"text":"WOW very delicious. Came here for lunch with my colleague and we decided to get something to share. So we ended up getting the bulgogi beef combo for 2 and it came with:

Bulgogi beef on a sizzling plate for 2
2 bowls of rice
lettuce
salad
and 4 side dishes

The rice was purple rice which means healthy. Loved the Bulgogi. It has lots of flavor in it. We were told that to eat it we are suppose to wrap the bulgogi in the lettuce and add in the red sauce that they gave us. It turned out to be delicious. The best part is their red sauce. Its a bit spicy. But very unique and again flavorful (not super spicy because I can't handle super spicy food).

I did notice that the restaurant is full of Korean people that means its authentic. Well it is located in a Korean Mall. Free parking is available but very limited. 

Overall, Loved the place and highly recommend coming here. Very legit."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night and based on the reviews, I thought this place would be packed. Luckily, there were many empty seats and we were able to get a seat.

I got the hot stone bowl (bulgogi and kimchi). I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that there was cheese in it! Other than that, the hot stone bowl was not anything special compared to other Korean restaurants. If you're into spicy food, you'll love the kimchi because it added a punch to the dish.

The reason why I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars instead of 4 is because the service was a bit lacking. It was hard to get their attention and then it took them forever to bring the bill to us.

The free lollipop at the end of the meal was very flavourful, especially the blue one! ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great.  

I have been here several times now and my opinion has never wavered. 

I even went here for my birthday, and the staff/family was wonderful:  they gave us complementary gyoza, miso soups, rice, tons of various types of kimchee, and an ice cream cake for my birthday.  

The food and bbq is delicious, a perfect blend of quality and quantity.  I also appreciate how you can cook the bbq at your table yourself. 

Wonderful experience every time, I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is decent. 

Debating between 3 or 4 stars but we'll give it 4 stars this time around because the service and ambience actually wasn't too bad and I'm feeling generous. 

We had a large group of about 10 people and it came out to about $20 a person. Ordered two \"combos\" plus 2 additional dishes (bibimbap). Make reservations beforehand though but there is plenty of space here to accommodate large groups. 

The seafood pancake was absolutely delicious. BBQ was not bad either. 

Will probably check out the other Korean places in town before coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome experience here. The food was great, but what made a huge difference was the service we had.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place in Korea Town. Amazing side dishes (love the kimchi + fishcakes). Owners son is a great host and makes the experience that much better. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Korean in the city. I eat here at least every month. My favourite things to get here are the LA kalbi ribs (definitely worth it to upgrade to the LA ones -- there's more meat and what's there is more tender and flavourful), the yam roll, the kimchi pizza, and the jap chae (though it's a little too oily). My one friend usually gets a teriyaki chicken and vegetables thing and it looks good. The tofu stew is decent, though not the best I've had. I love the banchan here, especially the ones with zucchini, bean sprout, and fish cake with that red paste. And Jay is a gem -- maybe the best server in the city. He remembers my order and gives me extras and remembers the people I come with. This is a great place. Give them business!"}
{"text":"Won't go back for bbq. 
good: 
side dishes are nice
bbq sauce is tasty, though not enough for two people
and if there are someone serving/helping, she/he is nice
BUT 
we waited in the doorway for 15 min, and the old lady kept asking us \"how many?\"for many times, instead of leading us to a table,we thought maybe it's because it's packed, but when we actually got in, there were a loooot of empty tables, have no idea why they kept us waiting for such a long time.
and it takes forever to call a waiter/waitress

pricy, and need to order at least two plates of meat to have a bbq, which is written in tiny letters on the top of the menu, 18.99 for one plate of pork belly (it's the cheapest one). 
more side dishes? pay for it. 
need more lettuce?? 3.99 (yes, we paid 3.99 for ten lettuce leaves because we ran out of the first basket when we started only for 10 min, and with the 3.99 lettuce we still ate the rest meat without lettuce,fatty & greasy). 

believe me, if you want to have korean bbq, save your time and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"CT's right, this place has moved. I've eaten at it in both locations and I must say, the new spot is better. It's bigger and more open. You could easily fit 6-8 people in their booths.

I haven't eaten a lot of Korean food to date, so have no comment on how authentic this place is. But it was tasty enough for me to help devour four full dishes between three people. There was this noodle dish that I especially enjoyed (good thing I'm the one who ordered it :p) with seafood and black bean sauce. The only part I didn't deal well with was the pieces of squid. With all of those ridges in them, they looked like gigantic worms. I couldn't bring myself to eat one of those.

Reasonably priced and a nice change from Vietnamese and Chinese, I'd give Korean Village 3.5 yums up."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto, first time here. I heard many good things about Korean BBQ and I wanted to try something near authentic. Anyway, this place is awesome and the BBQ too."}
{"text":"Amazing food, terrible service.

We came here really late on a Friday night, and surprisingly there was a line up. We waited for about 10 minutes and was seated. Lady at the front desk was super nice and smiley so we did not mind the wait despite how hungry I was.

Once seated, we flipped through the HUGE menu to find what we wanted. It was a bit overwhelming with all the Korean in the menu, and their selection of foods.

We finally decided on the KBBQ (spicy pork and chicken). Our server had a 360 complete opposite attitude compared to the front desk lady. She was not patient with our questions about the menu and had no facial expressions. Her responses were also very minimal...

Food came pretty quickly and we dived into it right away. We kept asking for more of the sauce that came with the KBBQ since it tasted delicious, and also the lettuce, rice, and meat had no to minimal flavour. We asked our waitress for our 2nd plate of sauce and she never came back. We had to reach out to someone else. We then asked her for napkins and she walked away with no response or expression, coming back with napkins after couple minutes. When we asked for more sauce for the third time, our waitress yelled at us (im not even exaggerating...) for putting so much sauce..?!?!?!

Food was amazing but I never encountered such terrifying service. The rest of our meal was just awkward...."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Korean Village. Large menu, friendly staff, tasty food. A lot of famous people had passed through those doors. I didn't realize this place was such a staple in Koreatown.

We were given complimentary fried dumplings (my friend joked it's because I sheepishly ordered in Korean, but apparently it is a fairly standard treat).  I wasn't crazy about their ddukboki or their kimchi, but the massive portion of bibimbap made me forget all about it.  So did the lemon soju - you gotta try it!

We met the owner when we were paying for our bills and she was lovely! Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Inhaled the food so fast I forgot to get a picture!

Love love love how Korean village was very generous with all of their dishes!

We ordered: 
Japchae: glass noodles wither veggies. Usually restaurants give a handful of veggies with mainly noodles but there were substantially more peppers, onions, and mushrooms than noodles!

Yukgaejang: filled with eggs, noodles, and veggies! Very impressed. 

Dolsot Bibimbap: came out very hot (which I loved)! Nothing special about it but it's a classic dish and you can't go wrong. 

Fish stew: my grandma ordered this one and she's usually a huge food critic but she devoured it without saying a word. And after her last bite, there was just the biggest smile on her face :) 

Side dishes: kimchi was fresh and good. 

Overall, I'd give it a 10/10 for food quality.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came to this location looking for 'Dae Jang Geum' b/c a Korean client recommended it but instead found out that it has been replaced with 'Korean Village' (restaurant that used to be on 10th and center near mustard seed).  Inside is plain, mostly all semi circle booths, actually kind of feels icky dirty old.  Furniture seems aged. I  was having a late lunch and just wanted something warm cuz I was soooo cold so I ordered soondubu (Tofu soup). They only offer seafood soon dobu so I asked for a substitution for portk (since I'm allergic) and they were able to do that.  She failed to ask how spicy I wanted it and it came out pretty spicy.....   What I didn't like was that the tofu inside was all smashed up and broken...not the same soondubu I remember in LA.  Parking in the parking lot is hard to find as it's busy in this strip mall and the lot itself is small.  I have to say though that my client recommended to come during dinner for their set dinner menus. So I'll have to try that one day."}
{"text":"The food was quite tasty, however for the price I wouldn't say it's nearly a fair deal. Korean food can be found for quite a bit cheaper. For specialty dishes this might be a great spot, but if you're just wanting a korean food fix, you'll be leaving paying a lot more than you would in most other establishments."}
{"text":"Great service! The owner was very nice. One of the best authentic kbbqs I've been to so far."}
{"text":"This was a more sporadic choice walking along the Bloor strip trying to find a restaurant. What happened next was unexpected. This was one of the fewer restaurants that completely knocked my socks off! Amazing Korean food and hospitality! and to be quite honest, I'm not a big fan of Korean food. I ordered the spicy fried chicken and my girlfriend ordered the short ribs. They came in HUGE portions and the quality was amazing. The highlight of the night though, was from the owner's son; I believe his name was Jay. He was very hospitable and enjoyable to speak to. The whole staff kept checking up on us, and Jay even gave us some mango ice cream pastry to try. This establishment has been around for years, and it looks like a lot of prominent individuals frequent this place. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to a next friend. Asides from the food, the hospitality and service is what made me rate this place a 5!"}
{"text":"Simple lunch but awesome experience!  Friendly & quick service.  Very roomy & clean place with great ambience.  Love the decor.  Pork bone soup special was DELICIOUS!!  Definitely come back here again SOON."}
{"text":"Great meal here last night! Food and service were wonderful and the cheque was very reasonable for our party of five."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Korean BBQ experience I have ever had.  From the family run aspect, to the freshness of the ingredients, everything thing here is just done right."}
{"text":"By far the best korean bbq experience I've had. And I've been to a few in Toronto.
The waiter, son of owner, is very charming and helpful. I can keep eating non stop at this place. The sides are very fresh tasty, best kimchi I've ever had was here.
A little secret, if you like spicy stuff, ask for the secret halopinio dill. It is amazing!!! Self made at the store."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  I haven't been to a lot of Korean restaurants in Toronto, but after living in Asia for 5 years, I feel like I can tell good from bad.  The food had an authentic taste to it, lots of flavour, and the right amount of heat.  I also like the decoration inside.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall
4 stars for the Bi Bim Bap
2 stars for the spicy pork with kimchee
4 stars for the service.

Walked in one cold December evening and we were immediately taken in by the sizzle of the grills and the very green foliage indoors. Also, by pictures of celebrities by the front door. Sandra Oh, you rocked your CBC shirt so! Korean Village Restaurant boss lady: you're a pretty middle aged korean lady, you really don't need to pancake your face so. You looked like you were in a production of Phantom of the Opera in some of those pics!.

Anyways, the bi bim bap was fantastic. Not very oily, unlike Arisu. Also a nice balance of crunchy and soft rice, also unlike Arisu. Eggy, shrimpy and vegetably. Very Nice.

The spicy pork was a disappointment. It wasn't spicy at all. It was very sour, perhaps a bit much even given the kimchi. Also, it was very, very fatty, way more than it should've been.

The banchan was great tasting and abundant: the fish cakes were stand-out awesome. They bring you refills regardless of whether you order bbq. Amazing.

The service was great. Both the waitresses had great glowing skin and were very polite. I've noticed that the Japanese and Koreans have amazing skin. I asked a Japanese friend once about this, and her secret is Vaseline. I dunno about the Vaseline, but perhaps it's something in the cuisine?"}
{"text":"My go-to place for gamjatang! the price cant be beat and it's spicy :) 

Service is great they keep refilling our water even we didn't ask them to!"}
{"text":"its pretty good, a little pricy though. I like the convex grill as appose to the flat ones some restaurants have, the meats get stuck to the grill that way.  the meats were nicely seasoned and food came out pretty fast.

Pricey though, 20 plus dollars for a plate of meat, if your group is hungry, you will go through the plates pretty fast.

Service was so and so.  Food came fast, and i was able to flag a waiter down when i needed to. They also help most tables cook the food, cause most didn't know how to do it properly. Only thing was,they never cleared the empty plates on the table, only when we left people came to clean the tables.

Overall, if you don't mind spending a bit, this place is pretty good.  Also, I didn't see anyone mention this, but they added the tip to my bill... i didn't mind the tip but hate when restaurants do that."}
{"text":"The price is a bit too steep for the portion, the food is ok but on average better than other korean restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"The food was average. Good atmosphere and nice service but the food (beef and chicken BBQ) was okay in respect to value for money."}
{"text":"Hands down the best table top BBQ in Korea town, awesome fresh side dishes and great kimchi.   

However I must say that my favourite thing here is Hedopap.  It's fantastic"}
{"text":"Food here was good, service was kinda slow. They never came by to refill our waters, gave us rice for our LA Galbi (we had to remind them to), or give scissors to cut the meat. Most of the waitresses didn't understand what I was asking for half the time.. I guess they weren't that fluent in english but otherwise, good food!!"}
{"text":"I came with friends and we were promptly seated in a booth.  The restaurant didn't seem that big but is a busy place. 

We decided to each get the beef bibimbap and the sides that accompanied included kim chee, pickled vegetables, potatoes, and a few other items.  The food came out quickly and it was hot.

The bowl had a good variety of the beef, vegetables and rice but I found it a little too greasy.  I would prefer it not as moist as the rice was.

The price was reasonable at around $10 or so per person but if I'm back, I would order something else.  It's also not a place to visit for a while as I think they were anxious to have our table cleared for the next customers."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Decided on this place through yelp. Was hoping Korean food was better in Toronto than in Florida. Ordered a seafood pancake, beef rib soup and 2 bulgogi lunch boxes. Seafood pancake wasn't bad. The beef for the rib soup was a bit over cooked and hard to chew. The service was not the greatest. Wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Let me be the first to admit that I don't eat KBBQ very often.

However, my experience here was absolutely amazing, mainly due to the service.

Initially it took a while for the servers to get to us. However, perhaps because of that, the owner's son provided us with amazing service.

He was incredibly charming to talk to, walked us through the intricacies of cooking and serving the food and he gave us all a free pair of socks (don't ask).

The food itself was delicious, flavourful and savoury. I definitely will return here when I get the chance."}
{"text":"Our first visit here tonight and it was a great experience. Definitely not cheap Korean food ($83 after tax for 3 of us) but it was delicious. We ordered the bulgoki and kalbi bone in for Korean bbq as well as the jap chae appetizer and the bulgoki and kimchi stone bowl bibimbap. The meats seemed to be good quality and Jay, the owner's son, took really good care of us. He spent a lot of time explaining the different dishes and also how to best way cook the meats. We were probably a bit too ambitious with the amount of food that we ordered but we were really hungry after a long day of snowboarding and my boyfriend eats a lot. What we ordered ended up being quite a bit of food and we were stuffed at the end but managed to polish off everything. The free mochi dessert at the end was a nice touch and a good way to end off a tasty meal! We'll be back - thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Worse than expected from the rating. Definitely super busy. Not worthwhile the wait. The fried pork and kimchee tastes funny, but the bimbimbup is okay with a lot of veges, which I love."}
{"text":"A fantastic time! Ordered the Bul Go Ki and the Kal Bi BBQ on the table and also ordered the Sushi Pizza. Everything was super delicious. I've never had sushi pizza before and was so very pleasantly surprised! The service was also fantastic! Jay, the owner's son was very hospitable and knowledgeable. It was a pleasure to have him cook up the BBQ. Personally, I loved it here and I would definitely come back. They have fantastic customer service and very good quality meat."}
{"text":"My party received probably the best service here of any place I've ever been to before. They were fast with our food(which is impressive for a party of 13+), incredibly friendly, constantly checking on us, even giving us free extras on some food without being asked. It's a family owned resuraunt and you can tell they really care about creating the best service possible.

The food was also delicious. I'm a vegan and our server was incredibly helpful in not only helping me with picking a dish and even following up to make sure my dish was vegan. I would heavily recommend this place."}
{"text":"went here for kbqq with 8 other people and it was excellent -amazing quality meat. i came back because of the 1st positive experience. however, it was a disappointement. i had brought along a Korean friend and a non Korean friend. We all agreed that the food was sub par. My Korean friend got the cold noodles and she said the broth had no flavour. My other friend and I both got bibambap and the bowl wasn't even hot, the rice was not crispy and no flavour for both of us either. the food came fairly quickly and maybe that's why. i also ordered spicy tuna roll on the side and I've had better...it literally came with a dollop of wasabi. very big disappointment with the flavour of this place because they have such good kbqq"}
{"text":"Service is great! Like how they run the family business, make you feel warm.
However, food doesn't taste very good.  Meat is plain, no taste even it looks like they have been marinated. 
With good service & average food, it evens out to be at the passing line."}
{"text":"I was really prepared to love this place because I had heard good things about it. Maybe they were just off their game last night because I was underwhelmed. To begin with, the place looks a little haggard and it is really really char-smelly because I didn't see any ventilation for the table barbecues, but I can overlook that if the food is good. Well, we got seated fairly quickly after a very lukewarm welcome from the host. I got the bulgogi and kimchi stone bowl and agadashi tofu for an app. The tofu had kind of a dirty oil taste about it which was only just masked by the heavy sauce. The stone bowl wasn't hot enough so the rice didn't toast at all which was a bummer. And the bulgogi didn't have a lot of flavour. I don't know. I wasn't feeling it at all. Not once did anyone come by to see if we needed anything or if we were enjoying the meal. And let's just say we'd still be sitting there now if we didn't eventually flag someone down for the bill."}
{"text":"So far this is the best Korean restaurant I've been to in Calgary. I'm enjoy the soups and the bibimbabs. Every time I'm in Calgary I visit this place and they keep cooking to my expectations. Service is not great but the food makes up for that. I rate based to the taste of food."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and pretty good portions. We tried the ddeokboki, bulgogi, tangsooyuk and japchae, all of which were nicely done. 

I would just say that, as an American, the dishes were a little pricey for what you get. Although, everything was tasty and well prepared. 

I would definitely come to this place again in order to try out more of their menu."}
{"text":"Tasty Korean Food!  Love the Bim Bim Bap and the Chap Chae.  Service was quick and friendly.  Love the little small dishes you get before your meal -- yummy spicy Daikon and KimChi!

Will return back!"}
{"text":"Our first dinner in Toronto, and Korean Village Restaurant was amazing.  The interior is a bit old school, but also charming - private booths, some private dining rooms, and lots of plants.  Most of the menu features Korean onions and then at the very end are some Japanese entrees and sushi - you want to skip those.  The highlights, aside from the freshest and most tasty banchan I've had, were the spicy shrimp stone bowl - a bibimbap with the usual suspects (egg, spinach, bean sprouts) with the addition of deliciously spicy shrimp.  And the jap chae, so often bland, was stellar - filled with onions, scallions, and bean sprouts.  The dinner for two came to $34, and if I loved closer, I would definitely become a regular here."}
{"text":"Waitress was downright rude. We asked for tea and water and they said choose only one. On top of that the side dishes took forever to come out. We had a party of four and the table next to us with 8 people got their dishes out first while coming after us! 

The food is pretty good but it's also pretty over priced. Come here if you don't mind the service and the price. Food is pretty good. Maybe you'll have better luck with a different waitress"}
{"text":"The first thing I thought when I walked in to the place,  was whether I was at the right place. It looked like a Japanese restaurant to me, and I confirmed the address by asking one of the hostess. The front entrance area is lined with photos with celebrities from all over the world, it looked impressive, but the place feels the opposite. 

It's required to order two portions in order to get table top bbqing. Therefore, we placed an order of the pork belly ($20.99) and seafood ($22.99). The bbq came with a bean paste sauce and a little basket full of romaine lettuces that are halved. There was no raw garlics or peppers that you usually find in a Korean bbq house. The meal came with 4 different \"ban chan\" (side dishes), and you have to pay if you want refills of the ban chan.

Overall, the meal was mediocre, I've had better Korean table top bbq in Toronto. Most Korean restaurants provides a lot of variety of ban chan with free refills, whereas it was not the case at Korean Village Restaurant. The service was ok. We won't be back."}
{"text":"There are no words... This place was friggin' awesome! My bf chose this place based on the Yelp reviews, and they did not steer us wrong ;) We went here with a bunch of friends for Korean BBQ. Can get a bit pricey, but it's really good to dish out some cash as a treat! And it's especially good to cook and eat a group (might want to make reservations in advance though, as this place gets busy!). The owner's son came by every now and then to chat with us about the restaurant and the food and even took some time to get to know us, as another reviewer said \"unobtrusively\", which is great! A lot of restaurants nowadays seem to lack that personal touch. Some of the others ordered food other than the Korean BBQ, incl. PBS and sushi, and they were all talking about how good that was too. Apparently this place has been around for 30-ish years and still thriving, so there's certainly a reason this place has great reviews and doesn't need to advertise and people keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Not a fan of Korean food but this is a nice spot that actually serves decent quality meat, unlike the AYCE places. Great service from start to finish and complementary dessert and candy! Price is a bit steep for the quantity but still fair."}
{"text":"Meh is right.
Maybe it's because I didn't get a glimpse of this owner's son, maybe it's because I didn't order the right food, or maybe it's because I came on the wrong day at the wrong time (7pm on a Tuesday night) but I was thoroughly disappointed with this place.

Yelp review had led me to want to check out this place for a while now, and I had almost set foot in here when my friend said he didn't like this place so we went elsewhere. Today, I finally convinced my mom to come with me--I was really craving for Korean BBQ.

We sat down and took a look at the menu for table cooking BBQ. Each serving was approximately $20+ and you had to order at least two portions. Fine, so we ordered Kalbi (boneless) for $24 and Pork Belly for $18. 

First came the miso soup (average) and ban chan - only five of them and the selections were abysmal and the taste was bland. One cucumber dish marinated in Korean hot sauce that was hot, one zucchini dish marinated in garlic, one really salty turnip dish, one yellow bean sprout, and one not very tasty kimchi.

The portions for the bbqs were pretty good, but for its price, there really wasn't anything too special about it. The kalbi was on the too sweet side while the marinated pork was just covered in light korean hot sauce paste. 

Our server was a nice old korean lady who didnt speak much English. The woman who took our bill didn't even smile. 

For $60 after tax and tip, I could be eating a king's feast anywhere on the Bloor strip that taste far better than this. Biggest Yelp-led disappointment yet :("}
{"text":"Hum.... They ruin my birthday cake by not putting in the freezer and the owner is fing raciest, he would entertain all white people but for Chinese people,  I guess they can be ignored. Never again, service is extremely disappointing......"}
{"text":"First off, I didn't get the glass of water I asked for until the 3rd time . Next we didn't get to cook the kbbq by ourselves. That takes away the entire point of ordering kbbq or atleast cook it properly and slowly. The waitress puts half the plate of kul bi on, cooking it on high heat, expecting us to eat all that in one sitting. We would really prefer to eat our own pace and have a conversation while cooking it. To add on to that, when we were finishing up the first batch she throws on the other half of kul Bi on the stove. Seriously? We still have a quarter left of meat on the stove. There's another problem. The 20% tipping the waitress did for herself. I handed my debit card only finding out she put in a 20% tip (16 dollars) on to my check and tapped my debit card. In my opinion they didn't even deserve 5 dollars. BEAWARE 20% SELF TIPPED ONLY TWO PEOPLE DINING AS WELL. Not coming back"}
{"text":"We came we saw and Jay entered...... 

The owner's enthusiasm and flair while helping us grill the meal was worth the price of admission (marinated meats).  

Would definitely go back.  Great time super nice owners and smells of bbq heaven."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice and cozy with enough space to not feel crowded. Food was a good amount but one thing that bothers me the most is that they charge extra for side dishes.... What Korean restaurant does that?!  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been twice and both times were spectacular. I too lived in Korea for a year and know when I'm eating good quality Korean food. Not only is the food delicious and authentic, the service is amazing! Both the owner and her son are extremely welcoming and make the experience that much more enjoyable. 

Unfortunately, I have no recommendations because it is all so good. Order whatever sounds good to you and you won't be disappointed. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ordered the pork bone soup and glass noodles. Both were delicious. It reminded me of how Korean moms would prepare it at home. Fresh and authentic. The side dishes were good as well. Portions were quite big, we were both stuffed coming out. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Always liked this place and serves authentic Korean dishes. Good bibimbap , kalbi and noodles. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"One of our favourite Korean restaurants in Koreatown. We live nearby and frequent this restaurant quite regularly. It's run by a family and definitely has a \"family-owned\" feel to it. Food is always great and the servers are always nice and attentive. Sometimes you have to wait a bit for food (which feels like a long time when you are hungry), but it's always worth it.

They also have GREAT sushi, so would highly recommend their sushi as well."}
{"text":"I've paid $10 for meals. I've paid $100 for meals. I've paid $500 for meals. And I've never had service that was as fast or as friendly as what I received at Korean Village in January with Brian A. (review below on 1/3).

I got free sushi to thank me for coming around the new year. (You'd expect the sushi at a Korean restaurant to be so-so, but let me assure you that it was phenomenal.) The owner's son greeted patrons in, by my count, at least 7 different languages. He seemed to know the lay of the land for every sports team you could want to talk about. The food was exceptional.

I rarely ever bother to leave reviews, but I knocked the extremely thick coat of dust off of my account to write this:

Best service I've ever received. Best Korean food I've ever had, and I'm no stranger to it. Biggest tip I've ever left. 

I walked three miles in bitter cold to get here, and I'd walk three more just to go back. KOREAN VILLAGE WAS AWESOME."}
{"text":"If you are meat-lover, then come here!!! We had a lot of different meat for BBQ. BBQ beef and ribs are my favorite. Around 28 dollars a dish, a little bit overpriced, but the meat are of high quality and are well prepared."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was amazing. Had the pork bone soup which was amazing. Also had beef, beef with bone and pork belly. All the meat was marinated great. Vegetable sides were very tasty. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you would like to have some authentic Korean bbq, and just overall korean cuisine - then you need to visit the Korean Village!

I have visited Korea a couple of times and every time I come back home or anytime I crave Korean food I go to Korean Village and order their tteokbokki (spicy rice cake, gamjatang (pork bone soup), tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork), jajangmyun, and kalbi. It's the closest thing to the food I ate in Korea. Also, I find that they serve the best dishes as well.

The restaurant needs  some sort of update/renovation, but overall it is clean enough. Their service is good as well, but I have had instances where no on has come back to our table to refill drinks or see how were doing until we call someone over.

I definitely recommend their tangsuyuk, it is the best one in Calgary - just super crispy and the sauce it just right, not too sweet or salty. If you order the tangsuyuk pair it up with their jajangmyeon, it's such a great combination."}
{"text":"The food in this restaurant was great. We ordered a lot of food and they were all great. For bbq, we got kalbi and bul go ki that were both great. The only issue was that the staff wasn't attentive, so they burned quite a bit of our meat. We got jap chae (Korean rice cakes - spicy though, be careful) for appetizer and it was delicious. We also ordered the hot bibimbap and they were all great. 

Would love to go again, but hope staff would be more attentive next time (or I will keep that in mind and keep an eye on the bbq myself)."}
{"text":"This place was solid.  Had the seafood pancake which had great flavours but seemed crazy overpriced at 15.99.  It is just a crepe afterall.

The Kal bi and Bulgogi dinners had great flavours, and for the price were comparable - I like this place in that they give you option to cook yourself or have the restaurant cook for you ( yes please!)

The reason you come back to this place is the service.  It is TOP NOTCH.  Uber friendly and attentive when you want them around.  Incredible service focused and patient, happy to recommend and discuss the menu with you.  It's kitchy, has plastic plants everywhere and poster advertising Korean beers, but it adds to its charm.  Recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a party of six last week. I found it underwhelming and overpriced for what you get. I am aware that awesome Korean BBQ is never cheap, but this is a C- restaurant that charges you as if they are on their A-game. The cuts of meat simply did not impress, we were not given much in the way of sauces or sides, and most of the appetizers we tried were a miss.

Off the top of my head, we ordered:

[Apps]
Yakitori = ok
Yaki Mandu = pass
Seafood Pizza = pass

[Tableside BBQ]
Large Assorted BBQ (beef ribs, bulgogi, chicken, pork belly, seafood) = bulgogi was ok; rest was disappointing both in quality and taste. 

To say this was an accurate representation of awesome KBBQ would be a stretch. This is to KBBQ as Applebee's is to an American steakhouse; it is aimed at tourists who do not know better. It's not bad, but it's nowhere near great or priced appropriately.

I'm still throwing them a few stars because the staff was at least pleasant and no one had a terrible time.

PS: They do not take AmEx"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant for Korean BBQ.
The staff is so friendly and gracious. My server is the son of the owner and he was really funny and made my meal very enjoyable.

The Ban Chan was very good, especially their kim chee (I had a second helping). There wasn't as many Ban Chan dishes served as other Korean restaurants, but all were very tasty and well made.

We had the large assorted plate for the BBQ and all the meats were nicely marinated and seasoned. The mildly spicy sauce they serve on the side was yummy, and I like how they provided a large plates of lettuce leaves to wrap the meat in.

They had a really nice Soju, which is a Korean sake but more sweet and the one I ordered was infused with ginseng and had a nice golden colour and went really well with the BBQ.

Be sure to order the ice cream filled mochi balls -- it made for a nice ending to the meal.

It makes me hungry writing and thinking about this restaurant! I might go here tonight!"}
{"text":"We were there as a group of 4 people hungry for Korean food.  We live in the part of the U.S. where Korean food is readily available so maybe our expectations were high.  The only reason for 4 stars here instead of 5 is that because they try to have too many kinds of Korean food, nothing particular was exceptionally tasty or memorable.  Otherwise, if you want a decent Korean food prepared in a generic manner, you will like it."}
{"text":"Really good place but damn expensive!!!!! My boyfriend is korean and wanted me to try korean style sweet and sour chicken.  Its so good! Perfect crispy and crunchy and unlike chinese sweet and sour chicken, its not as sweet.  Amazing.. but jeez, so expensive at $23.99.. and it didn't even come with rice.. i got the kimchi and bulgogi bibim bap which was good.. expensive and it tastes like something i've had somewhere else that was cheaper.. we got the private room which was nice.. if it was a rating for food and service, its an easy 4.5/5.. but since it was expensive, it gets a 3/5"}
{"text":"My friend and I went in yesterday for a late lunch. 

The service was non-existent, during the whole time we ate, they came around once to check up on us. They were more concerned with talking amongst themselves near the kitchen. Also, there was a fruit fly in my friend's water.

The food was good, sure, but I could get good food anywhere in Korea town, it's the service that makes the biggest difference (and makes loyal customers). 

To top it off, the ahjumma waitress asked us straight up for a tip when she checked our receipts (we paid by debit). 

I definitely won't be returning there, neither will my friend, or any of our friends."}
{"text":"Expennnnnnnsive.  IMO.  I got the galbi dinner which I finished easily and it was $23.  Smaller portion than what I get at Oja for lunch by work (and lasts me 2 days), but more tender.  Huge bones to take home to the dog- so that's a plus.

Service was funny and gave us the bill in Korean.  Thank God we had a translator with us ;)


Again- better Korean Food in Toronto than Annandale around DC.  It just keeps getting better.

Remember- in a korean restaurant the server is there to serve you, not hear your life story.  Hit the button order, demand, pay, then GTFO."}
{"text":"Overall the food was okay. We had the rice cake, seafood pancake and beef rib dinner. Surprisingly, when we asked for the bill, the tip was included at 15%, for the two of us. Not to mention, the owner's boss greeted every table around us but made sure he ignored us every time he walked by."}
{"text":"New in town and still exploring the city. We love korean cuisine so we've searched for a restaurant that was highly rated - and found this restaurant. Uberly satisfied. Food was really great and will defo come back next time."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends to celebrate someone's birthday. We ordered the KBBQ to share, and the waitress helped us put everything onto the grill (after we nearly burned ourselves, oops). It was my first time having authentic KBBQ, and honestly it was so good I'm already craving for more. My side of the table got the pork belly and bulgogi (came with some mushrooms too). Although the meat didn't exactly wow me, it was generally a good experience. 
I tried some of my friend's jajangmyun which was a lot better than I expected. There were a lot of onions left over, but I don't know if that's because he was being picky or if they used onions as a filler ingredient. 
What I also like about this place is the size of their side dishes. Normally, the portions at other Korean restaurants are modest, but the ones here were pretty plentiful (but we were a large group, so that may have influenced it). Limited in variety, but still very good. 

The only con was the service. We didn't have enough utensils for the amount of people we had, and the waitress didn't get around getting another set for about twenty minutes. She also seemed kinda confused and frantic, but it was busy, so I can let that go. Strangely enough, she lied about there only being wifi on the top floor of the place even though I was already connected (she was saying this to the other end of my table). 

Because we were a group larger than six, the restaurant charged us a 15% service fee. That's pretty normal, so no complaints. They also gave us lollipops after we got the bill, which was really nice. I loved the lollipops; they were great. 

Overall, this was a great experience, and I'm already looking forward to the next time I'm at Korean Village."}
{"text":"Update:  Korean Village Restaurant is now in a new location.  The restaurant is now located in what I call it the Korean complex, next to Community Foods.  They took over the spot that used to house another Korean restaurant \"Sorabol\"?   I can't remember.  The location is bigger, better air ventilation.  I can see many Korean bbqs in the future as they have the special bbq tables.  Lots of Koreans frequent the restaurant so you know it's authentic Korean food.  

I can't believe my ears when my sister saw the restaurant when we drove past.  Turned around and stopped for a bite to eat.  

Dogani Tang, Seafood Pajeon, Mandoo and Dolsot Bibimbap - we have found you again!  We thought we'd lost Korean Village forever!  

We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Once again, this restaurant does not dissapoint.  Brought a group of 13 with me and we had an absolute blast.  Food was great,  sushi was on point,  and the Korean BBQ was delectable.  All of this would make this place tops in my books. But to add to all of this, you have the owners son Jay, who is an absolute gentleman who truly cares about his business.  Witty, funny, and he speaks multiple languages, if you're lucky enough to have him as your waiter he will truly make your experience top notch. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A.k.a. \"Korean Han Kuk Kwan\"...  
~~~
Reading reviews for this place, many ppl gave it 4 or 5 stars (on both yelp and restaurantica), mainly for the food - and also because of service.  

My debonair companion and I were immediately greeted with a large and friendly smile as we entered.  We were there tonight, Sunday evening, and seated right away.  

TIMING: Items from the initial glass of water to even the actual meal items... all arrived at a reasonable if not good time.  You know how you'd definitely notice if a meal wasn't coming?  I noticed, while there, that the timing was good.

FOOD: I ordered the Vegetarian BiBimBap in a stone bowl $12.99, came with miso soup.  I tasted the soup, and it was particularly good (as the owner's son shared with us), but it was fish-based.  Mr. Suave, the person I was with, ordered the House Special Pork dish.
The food was good, tasty.  I've been to Korea, so I can't say this is the best Korean food that I've ever had.  It was, however, good!
Portions are good.  We both filled up, after ordering just one main dish.

YAY: Food came with 5 complimentary dishes.  The owner's son, Jason,  took note of how much we enjoyed their bean sprout dish and their pickled brownish radish dish, and brought over a bonus serving.  Jason must have also thought we were sharing my one miso soup and so brought out a complimentary bowl just for my partner alone to enjoy, too.

(RACISM?): I read another review elsewhere, from a woman who came here 6 months ago for her birthday, with her fellow asian boyfriend.  She said they went on a Wednesday night, but were badly served...  They left without ordering anything.

Having some asian blood in me, I was actually not sure of the kind of service I'd get.  But that quick and genuinely welcoming smile from the owner, coupled with all the attentiveness that we received, left us feeling like royalty or at the least, like celebrities.

There were other asians there as we entered, so although I feel bad for the woman who typed that review, I wish she'd give the place another chance.  I had a very positive experience, and the other asians there seemed to be having a good time, too.

VEGETARIAN-FRIENDLY:  comme ci, comme ca.  I read somewhere that this place was veg-friendly.  Actually, they seemed to have only one dish that was (their vegetarian bibimbap).  They have sushi there, but I wanted to have Korean food since it's a Korean establishment.  Mind you, the sushi chef seemed to really be doing a good job.  No veg section yet... lots of pork, chicken, beef, fish options... so all you omni/carnivores out there... you'll be happy.
I should have asked Jason if there were any more veg options, but after deciding on my dish, I didn't want to bother asking about what else there was.

SERVICE: was lovely.  Waitresses all seemed to be Korean in background.  I think everyone working there was Korean, which oftentimes lends to the whole atmosphere of the place.  Especially Jason, the owner's son, who came around periodically and was so helpful and gracious throughout our visit - we felt honoured? to get just the right amount of his attention.

OTHER: We asked and learned that to say It was Tasty in Korean, say \"Ma-shi-so-yo\"  and Thank you is \"Kamsa Hamnida\".

GO AGAIN: Yes, we would!"}
{"text":"I thought it's kinda pricy for the korean bbq but hey when it's not AYCE and Downton that's what you pay for (my korean hairdresser told me to go to Yonge and finch if I want better and cheaper Korean BBQ). The great thing is the servers help cook the meat for you so that was nice. The food tasted ok like not amazing but not bad. I was surprised the pork belly was very good I had it elsewhere and didn't like it and almost didn't order it here. the servers and cashier were all very nice."}
{"text":"We really like it here. The Korean BBQ and bibimbop are so good.  Friendly service and interesting venue. Very reminiscent of the 80's with the decor and music, which I love. Great family restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food, amazing fish cakes as starters, they bring you more and more.. excellent service. The price couldn't be better! Would go back anytime."}
{"text":"Service is slow. Ready to wait for over 30 minutes for your food. No one cares about you. Not even the side dishes."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant outside New York I've ever been to - hands down. Service is king. 

This really funny guy, Jay was our server and was full of surprises and tons of jokes. He brought some of the best appetizers I've ever had, especially kong na mul (pickled bean sprouts), marinated/pickled zucchini.

The duk mandoo guk (Korean beef stew with soft/chewy rice cakes & beef dumplings), which is the annual traditional New Years dish, which I love year round.

Jay was incredibly helpful with ordering, getting our drinks on time and even giving us salutations in multiple languages.

The jap chae and bulgogi were also very good. The sticky rice was stellar.

Definitely the best Korean I've ever had in Canada. Don't go to one of the Japanese places that serves Korean.

Highly highly recommended."}
