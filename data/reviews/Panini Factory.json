{"text":"Avoid this place. No run as fast as you can from it.   The service is terrible. Conceited amateurs serving poor quality food.  Better off spending your money at McDonalds."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot if you're in the area. Good quality ingredients and friendly people. The panini's are great but I personally wait for the specials. Between the soups and pasta specials Im always leaving full and happy. Sometimes they even do entree specials which are even better. Check it out. Can be a little pricey but really the quality of ingredients is above most of the places in walking distance within the area."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for this area with a super friendly owner. Sandwiches are great, the latte not so much."}
