{"text":"WOW!!! AMAZING place!!!! I so recommend for everyone to come and enjoy this incredible place. We were at the National this Saturday with friends and had an awesome time: delicious food, friendly service, great live music (all night long!!!), and a wonderful surprise of a Las Vegas style show, which was mouth dropping. People celebrating different events and all joining on the common dance floor and the party at this place goes until 2 am! ;)  it's a true HIDDEN GEM that we discovered. do yourself a favour and try it out!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. I had my wedding there. It was supposed to be the best day of my live but this banquet hall almost made it the worst. About songs, music SERIOUSLY guys?  \" \" \" ? OMG.. What century you are in? Honestly we couldn't dance at all.. We would stand up to dance but the music would make us sit down.. usually it's the opposite.. ok if your singers cann't  sing party songs put something from YOUTUBE for Crist's sake.. don't ruin peoples day please ! Show was at 10:30 when everybody was  already tired and bored from the gross songs...                           About food....  ...............:)) we didn't go home hungry with the $85 menu.:))                     The stuff was good ..no complains about them....But the worst part of the day was, party started when we were about to leave. That was even more frustrating .. we were waiting them to pack our food and then all of a sudden they started to sing all good latino songs one after the other.. Ohhh boy                             I will not go there ever again even if someone invites me there. Sorry I had to say this."}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding recently. Never been to a Russian wedding. I was impressed by how food was served because I've never seen this before. The servers place food on a stand with multiple arms in the middle of the table. Every 20 mins or when the plates were cleared the servers put a new dish on the stand. This is kinda self serve but it's good because there's a lot of variety for dinner :) also alcohol everywhere on each table & a open bar :D"}
{"text":"We were at this venue for a family event. Overall with the service can give them 4 stars. Our pre-set menu was green salad and penne in tomato basil sauce. Then we got this amazing risotto, very buttery, with saut√©ed onions and mushrooms. As main grilled chicken breast and veal parmigiana. They were delicious and tasty. The staff was very attentive and prompt and they did a very good job. The only thing i didnt like was the alcohol, all the brand name alcohol was not the original ones, they filled the bottles with some other stuff was terrible! The place needs to be more organized for visual like their plastci serving carts all around, dont look good. The stuff thrown all around on the floor, at the entrance useless tables leaned against ghr wall. Simple things, could have been better."}
{"text":"If you enjoy eating garbage, this is the perfect place for you. Entertainment was standard but I'm pretty sure they are cutting corners here, everything tastes like you are about to get food poisoning, I will update you from my death bed because I tried everything that was on the table."}
{"text":"Oh, those Russians... They certainly know how to throw a good party.   Last Saturday, I was given an opportunity to enjoy what many Russians and Eastern Europeans do on a weekend night: dress up in your best semi-formal outfit to enjoy copious amounts of food and watch a Las Vegas style show. The term of \"overkill\" isn't a factor at National Restaurant, everything is done BIG: lots of food, lots of glitz and glamour, lots of fun.   The night: Celebrating a friend's birthday, our group of 15 people ventured up to Little Russia (or Little Ukraine, depending on who you ask), in North York. The restaurant is open six days a week with a live music and dancing show every night. It seems odd to go to a banquet hall for dinner when it's not a wedding, and at one point, I thought we were crashing one after walking past a bride and groom posing for pictures. But we weren't in the wrong hall: every occasion, from weddings to birthdays to a night out with friends, are celebrated all in one room, with everyone else.   The dress code: One person's tacky leopard-print outfit is another person's... treasure? It's safe to say that if you own any sequin, gawdy jewelry, leather, pleather or animal-print outfit, you can wear it here. Personally I felt modest in a black dress, boots and zebra-print earrings. Despite this personal choice of style by some, I actually like the idea of dressing up in your best outfit for a dinner and show. How come we North Americans have become casual about this?  The food: When we entered the main hall, I was astonished by the sight of food decorating the tables. Each table had plates of food that seemed to fill every a square inch of table space. Some dishes were resting on top of other plates!   Until then, my experience with Russian and Eastern European cuisine was limited to caviar, borscht and whatever vegetable you can pickle. Our four course meal consisted of cold and warm appetizers, followed by a fish and meat course. I made an effort to try everything, though some I couldn't resist sampling a few times, such as:  - eggplant and tomato puree with loads of garlic - blinis with caviar - pickled cabbage, cucumbers and watermelon (the latter being my new favourite!) - chicken kebabs - shredded chicken salad - spiced mushrooms - stuffed turkey neck  - bread pastry (almost phillo) with stuffed cheese  Since the food was already laid out when we arrived, we began eating at 8pm, washing it all down with vodka and wine. The last serving of food put on our table was around 11:30pm or midnight, after which you have dessert, fruit and coffee. Much of the appetizers remained on the table the entire night.   The entertainment: The band began to play at 9pm, and everyone flooded the dancefloor. Four singers shared the stage, each singing popular songs in English, Russian and Hebrew. I only understood a third of them, except for when one of the singers, a Michael Jackson impersonator, came on stage singing \"Billie Jean\". Along with the singers were the odd videos that played on the large screen behind them. These videos included various images of flowers and sunsets, to movie clips and images of Aishwayra Rai, Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities. If I understood Russian, I'd tell you why these ladies graced the video screen but I have no clue. I just watched, along with my non-speaking Russian friends, perplexed and fascinated.   After nearly two and a half hours, the band stopped playing and we stopped dancing but the show was far from over. A half dozen showgirls took the stage, dancing folkloric dances to Vegas-inspired numbers dressed in big feathered headdresses and sequined bodysuits. A couple, the main attraction I suppose, took the stage dancing outrageous and quite funny (read: cheesy) numbers. Again, this was fascinating and entertaining to watch.    The cost: With the entertainment, the fixed menu food and the pre-ordered beverages, our bill came to $65 per person, which isn't a bad price. However this price did not include gratuities to the server so we had to add a few extra dollars on top of that bill.   Conclusion: Would I return to National Restaurant and Banquet Hall? Hells yes! Despite the sensory overdose of tackiness and abundance of absolutely everything, it was a wonderful night out celebrating a friend's birthday, while enjoying one of the best dinners experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"All I can say is wowzers!  As their website slogan reads \"Make your life Tasty\" Indeed!  Came here with Hubby for his employer's Christmas Dinner party and what a spectacle of spectacles.  The food was  bountiful and served up dutifully by the banquet hall servers in a never ending  succession of courses.  Truthfully I found the food to be really heavy handed and too meaty for my liking, but hubby was really digging the Sodium/Carnivore-fest.  I saw a lot of fashion faux pas happenings in every fallible combination of textiles and proportions. Leather and lace, fringe and sequins, leg o mutton sleeves with tiered frill skirts. Yep, this was where fashion came to die and be reborn as some surrealist drag extravaganza.  But for some the \"Married to the Mob\" look is the epitome of chic so I'll leave it.  The live entertainment was Vegas by way of Bolshoi Circus with dancing girls (no not that kind silly!) singers and the MC was dressed like a White Russian version of Wesley Snipes' Demolition man character \"Simon Phoenix\" (please Google it , if only to get the jist of how crazy this outfit is) all the while twirling and crooning like a hybrid of Liberace and Michael Flatley from Lord of the Dance.   To wrap up there was a bounty of sweets served with coffee and tea while the DJ played top 40 hits mixed with Russian songs as people tried to dance their calories off.  I won't go into too much more specifics as I feel the previous review did National great justice, so I'll say if you like really hearty food that is heavily carnivorous and have an appreciation for the ironic, than by all means National Restaurant will have you toasting the Russians with zeal."}
{"text":"This place is the worst ever.  We came here to watch a concert.  First off a little accidentally runs into a glass door and that same door ends falling down on her. She hit her head and it was bleeding.    First off all she's only 6 and she's a little girl so I don't understand how her running into a glass door can end up falling on her.  The staff was not helpful at all it was almost like they blamed the little girl.  The ambulance came to get her so please send her positive vibes.    Then another girl was performing on stage and a piece of glass got stuck on her foot while she was performing.  Don't they do any safety checks in the venue.  There were tons of kids around.  What's even worse is that there were broken pieces of glass on the ground and didn't even clean it up until an hour after the little girl left to go to the hospital.  The staff was just sitting there not realizing pieces of glass is on the ground and another child could get hurt or have signs put up to at least say not to enter where the broken glass is.  I mean they're asking for another accident to happen!  All their stuff is old and torn down, plus staff doesn't want to take responsibility plus they're rude blaming the customers for their run down equipment.  Not cool!  Just be aware of this if you ever have to go there which I hope you don't."}
