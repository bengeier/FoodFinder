{"text":"This really is a hidden gem for Korean food in Thornhill. Cheap and delicious, I have yet to have a Korean dish here I did not enjoy. Definitely the best place to eat in the food court.

Never had their sushi so no comments on that."}
{"text":"Hidden inside the food court, this place has good korean food at an affordable price!! :)

It offers a variety of korean food. We ordered gamjatang (pork bone soup) and jajangmyeon (black bean sauce noodles). Portions were big and very filling!   

The gamjatang was full of flavour and tasted better than those in restaurants. Jajangmyeon was good too!! 

The food court was very empty so it was nice and quiet and noone rushed us to leave! Definitely give this place a visit if you are around the area!"}
{"text":"Located at 3rd level food court above season's market, but very good quality and deal! For just $9 (tax included) it comes with large boiling hot pork bone soup, and rice plus 3 side dishes  enough for two. Very nice chef! Will come again!"}
{"text":"My work is in the same plaza so I always eat from there all the time. Despite being in the food courts, they have better Korean foods than many Korean restaurants. I admit that I've only tried their ddukboki (any variation) and spicy pork with rice only since I usually get take outs (and they are easy to eat at work) but given their amazing services and good side dishes I'm very sure other dishes are as good as ddukboki and spicy pork."}
{"text":"I would give this 3.5 stars. When I was first exposed to Korean cuisine - maybe 15 years ago, I would always, always order Soon Tofu. Because it has everything I like; tofu, seafood, soupy, and a bit of spiciness.

This place makes a very solid Soon Tofu. I like the fact that they put clam (with the shells) in it. The broth is flavourful with a punch. 

If you're not too hungry, the special combo of ramen (Korean instant noodle) and kimbap for $6.95 would be a good option."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good though it's in a depressing strip mall. The kimche pancake was pretty cool and the bibimbap was decent but not great."}
{"text":"I was greeted by very friendly ladies when placing my order. The service was really good for a place in a food court. If you stay here to eat, they will bring out the food to you at your table. It took maybe 10 mins or less to make my order after I placed it. 

I ordered the chicken katsu. It came with salad, edamame, rice, and miso soup. It was quite a lot of food and well worth it for the price. Everything tastes really good. I really liked the salad. It wasn't just soggy lettuce drowned in dressing. It was very fresh and had a few different veggies in it. The dressing was also delicious. The rice was regular plain sticky rice, no salt or flavour. The soup was pretty good as well. Sometimes I find miso soup very salty but that was not the case here. The edamame was still in its shell (is that what it's called?) but seemed like it was slightly salted and and maybe boiled? It was delicious, whatever they did to it. 

This place accepts debit and credit as well as cash. I will definitely return to try some of the Korean specialties next time! There really aren't many options inside this good court but Sakura is my favourite so far."}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of food, even though it says \"Sushi\" they also do some Korean dishes, which I haven't tried personally (not a fan) but my friends have and they liked it a lot! Their bento boxes are cheap and affordable, and they're also yummy and fill you right up!"}
{"text":"Came here to pickup some cheesecake but decided to grab lunch in the area first. Went to the mall and made it to the upper level where the food court is. The food court was half empty so that made making the decision easier.

Ordered food and sat down at a close by table to wait. The girl behind the counter walked out and delivered the food to the table. The presentation of the food was amazing for a food court meal, it was restaurant standard. The side salad was the good stuff, mixed healthy greens. The katsu was fried really well, crispy until the very last bite even with the sauce. The beef in the bento box was a little overdone and the portion was on the smaller side. There's a lot of veggies in both meals. Bonus, meal comes with miso soup and a cup of tea just like a regular restaurant.

Overall, place is out of the way but definitely first choice of food at the food court."}
