{"text":"The reviews on here are most likely from the owner. I placed an order for delivery through Eat24 and was told that it would be delivered in 45-60 min. After an hour and 10 minutes, I was told that the driver was on his way. Two hours after I placed the order, I tried calling the restaurant to cancel my order and no one would pick up. Finally was able to cancel through Eat24 but am really upset that they just ignored my order. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place while having service done to my vehicle... That's for another review. Anyways, this guy was quick and very accommodating with my order as I was next door. I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and Medium traditional wings.... Wow. I've had many of both of these at a variety of places as they are two of my favorite types, and this was one of the best, for both. In short, the owner is a really nice guy, the food I tried was great, prices were great and atmosphere was clean and peaceful. I think the only struggle here is exposure. If you're in the area, give it a try and support local business. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute diamond in the rough! My friend and I had a hankering for wings a while back and the one other review on yelp sounded so enticing,  we thought we would check it out.   The place is a little difficult to find (be on the north sode of the light rail tracks, heading west, and turn in by the car shop), but your efforts will not be unrewarded.  Inside is very basic, nothing fancy here. This business is delicious food, no time for pomp and circumstance.   The owner of New York Classic Subs is straight out of Buffalo NY and he knows his wings. These puppies are big, meaty, and slathered in the perfect spicy yet flavorful wing sauce in the valley. If you have ever had Duff's or Anchor Bar wings (the original \"Buffalo Wings\" in upstate New York, you'll be having flashbacks of greatness when you taste these phenomenal imports! Best part: the price per pound of wing is one of the best around.   For those not looking for wings, I hear the number one customer complaint is that the sandwich options \"are just too big to eat at one time\". I, for one, see that as a compliment.   TL; DR-great, cheap buffalo wings. Good food in a small little corner of Phoenix."}
