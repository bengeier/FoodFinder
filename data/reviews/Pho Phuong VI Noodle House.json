{"text":"This is my favorite noodle place. Clean up class amosphere. Amazing food. Fast and professional service."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here with high expectations after seeing all of the positive reviews and we were pleasantly surprised. Though it doesn't look like much from outside, it's actually quite clean and pleasant inside. I ordered the beef saté pho (#15) and my partner ordered the coconut curry chicken with potatoes and noodles (#22). The beef saté pho broth had a very prominent BBQ taste, which I didn't care for at first (as I was expecting something else), but it really grew on me. The beef was perfect - tender, not much fat (finally!), and very tasty. The portion was HUGE. My partner's dish was very creamy and a little bit spicy, and the chicken was all dark meat (not my thing, but he loved it). The coconut taste wasn't super obvious, but it was a bit sweet. His portion wasn't quite as large, but still pretty big. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After all the seedy bars in this location it is refreshing to see a place so nice and clean. Food is good and the service is outstanding / consistent! Don't bother with the shop on the corner, come here. I have had Pho at 20-30 different places in Calgary and this is one of the nicest looking places with some of the best service."}
{"text":"This is my standby place for lunch during the week. The service is super-fast, but you're not rushed to leave. The owner and our two regular servers are friendly and always remember us.  The deep-fried pork dumplings are my favourite way to start. You get six with an order, so share (yes, after the first bite it can be hard not to snatch the rest). The outside is nice and crisp, the inside is hot and the sauce is delicious.   When it's cold out I usually get the Wor Wonton Soup, but lately I've been working through all the vermicelli bowls. I'm pretty sure the best one is the Chicken Satay with Spring Rolls, although more investigation is probably necessary."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem of a place !! Only Vietnamese place that still uses GREEN lettuce in the dead of winter !! Go figure ?!!? Always fresh and always fast !! The Vegetables are always crisp ! Never had a bad meal or bad service.......which always keeps me coming back for more !! A delicious island in the ocean of vietnamese places in this town."}
{"text":"Good food and service at a reasonable price.   Had a noodle bowl some spring rolls and lemon grass chicken with noodles. Fed the two of us for under $50."}
{"text":"We liked it!  Very casual place in a strip mall.  Some Chinese decorations.  The curried noodle bowl was excellent.  Came with a plate of bean sprouts.  Chicken and potatoes in the noodle bowl.  Huge serving.  I wonder if they allow you to split bowls.  Tea was only a dollar each.  They have appetizers and entrees in addition to the bowls.  Service was good and food came fast.  A little cold inside.  Both Chinese and non Chinese clientele.  I would go back.  Prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"We ate there last night. We both had a vermicelli bowl with meat  The portions are small. The food did not have much flavor. And overall we were both unsatisfied.  Customers can get more bang for their buck at other Vietnamese restaurants where the prices are cheaper the food is tasty her and the portions are larger. (Plus, parking is minimal). We won't be going back b"}
{"text":"A friend suggested coming here for a quick bite on a Saturday night, and I must say it was really only mediocre for a place that had 4.5 stars on Google. Almost $15 after tax before tip for a bowl of pho, and I noticed the bowl was big but there wasn't actually a lot of stuff in it. What I found kind of strange was there were no size options for the pho. Service was actually not too bad, the young lady we had was attentive. I had an alright experience but don't think I'll be back, at least not for the pho."}
{"text":"This is one of the freshest Viet around .. Had salad rolls , pho , and have tried the noodle bowls .. All amazing . You have to do a U turn after the store if coming from downtown area , but no big deal .. Some of the best I have had in Calgary hands down . Also I like the atmosphere , could be a good date spot or just lunch or dinner .. A lot of Viet places seem dirty or questionable decor but here they've done a great job . They have no problem modifying your order either .. EAT HERE !!"}
{"text":"I went to eat here with my husband and my cousin before going to the Prince concert. A pho place right beside where we were staying - sweet!  When we walked in I was struck by how big and nice it was. Lots of tables and space to walk. Modern and simple decor, well lit and clean. Good first impression. Even the menus looked cool, covered with what looked like faux-bamboo. The waiter and the lady who seated us (owner?) were both really friendly and smiling all night.   I was a little less than happy when I opened the menu. There is a lot of food to choose from, but the prices were higher than I'm used to for pho. There were only a few types on the menu - albeit some interesting choices like seafood - but the cheapest one was $8.50 and went up to $10! I'm used to paying around $7 usually. My husband ordered the seafood one which had lobster balls, crab and shrimp. I ordered a coconut curry with chicken.   I don't know a lot about curry, but it looked strange to me when it came out. It was more like soup, there was so much curry (broth?), and not a lot else in it. There was chicken and potatoes and nothing else, and rice on the side. I was further disappointed that the chicken was dark meat which I really don't like, so I didn't eat all of it. The flavour of the curry was fine, but I don't usually just drink curry like soup so it was a bit much. I tried my husband's soup and liked it. He really liked it as well. The bill for three people came to $34 with tip, which, again, seems high to me for a pho place compared to the places I usually go to.  When we walked out of the restaurant I had a fine feeling about the experience. However, later on me and my husband both had upset stomachs, one of us worse than the other. Admittedly this did put a damper on my opinion of the place. I'm still giving them three stars because they seem like nice people who are putting effort into their business, but the high prices compared with the sickness brought it down."}
{"text":"The broth was amazing! Big portions too. Friendly service :-) it's on the north side of 16 ave and there is a meridian so come from the east or drive from the north to get there :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, reasonable prices and amazing service. My favourite Vietnamese place by far!"}
{"text":"You fellow Yelpers know I love my tastey bowl of Pho like no other and so when I heard from another website that Pho Phuong Vi received a 96% I knew I had to go and check it out for myself.  I've realized a lot of Pho establishments are trying to up the appearances of their restaurants, this means new decor, kind of designer, nice colors, nice looking menu's the whole nine yards.  However I've also noticed all these restaurants with this modern decor also lack in the taste department. Some of these places seem to spend so much money and energy they totally forget about the food itself.  As my friends and I came into the restaurant we were greeted and sat down at a table, the two staff members there seemed to be very friendly one might of possibly been the owner.  Before I continue I have to say one quick thing - when I come to a Vietnamese restaurant I always order in Vietnamese, it's a \"thing\" for me and it is something I always do. When I goto a Chinese restaurant and I order something in Chinese (given I pronounce it properly) I expect the same, so on and so forth. One thing that I really didn't like about this restaurant was that it seemed that my server didn't understand one bit of Vietnamese. I can tell she tried her best to memorize the menu items by ear so she could remember what number it was but in Asian restaurants I find if I order in their native language they always understand.  Anyway.  The food.  As usual I order my Pho Tai Bo Vien. I ordered in Vietnamese, repeated myself, finally just told her what number it was and ordered to their english definition. However, I also noticed that the english definition half the time was slightly off from it's true meanings. Not a big deal. I really disliked the fact and as I've said before for other Pho restaurants the one size bowl. I like to eat to my stomach's appetite and a large/x-large bowl isn't always what my stomach wants to eat and it's definitely nice to have the option.  I don't mind when restaurants serve me Pho in bigger bowls because I know their thumb's won't be inside my soup if they aren't serving me from a tray (look at my other reviews :P) but this was a gigantic bowl with not even half the bowl filled with broth. There were in my opinion not enough noodles. The beef was good no complaints in that department.  Now the broth..is what I probably disliked the most -- pretty bland, seemed to me very watered down. I never try to base my broth opinions of what I eat at my Mother's house because that would be biased. However, I can tell a bland broth from a super rich broth - just look at the color and you can tell how well the broth is made. In this case it seems to have been filtered with water so many times. I hate adding too much Hoisin sauce and Hot sauce to my broth (usually just a dribble of two) but I add to add quite a bit to get some kind of taste going.  My friend had ordered the Curry Chicken with...Noodle I do believe can't remember if it was Vermicelli or Pho noodles. It really doesn't matter. I was interested in tasting the broth because I usually will never ever have curry outside of my Ma's house.   The broth I found was very bland -- it tasted more like water than it did like curry. I don't like super strong curry tastes however I do like it to be noticeable in my mouth. I was trying to see if it tasted like East Indian curry but I don't think it was anywhere near that kind of flavor either that's why I said it tasted more on the water side.  As a side note I don't think I'll be coming back here ever again. My friend and I hung out the entire day basically and our first meal of the day was eating at this restaurant and after she had finished eating the Curry Chicken a few hours later she started vomiting and being very nauseous. After she could stop vomiting for a little while  she went directly to the Doctor where he said she had received food poisoning. I assume this was because the Chicken was not properly cooked. She didn't eat anything else that day basically and it's just a matter of my opinion and what has transpired after eating there. I wasn't effected - I didn't have any of the chicken just a quick sip of some soup.  There's my review and my opinion of this place -- it probably will be a very long time before I come back here. Like I always say, International Avenue is the home of Pho. The SE/NE quadrant that that houses the majority of Pho establishments in Calgary is where to eat Pho at."}
{"text":"This is  my favorite Vietnamese restaurants to go to for soup or pho.  I am a little particular when it comes to the Sate that is used and these guys have it dialed in. Not too spicy and great flavor. Their peanut sauce and salad rolls are awesome as well. Definitely check it out as it'll be your new favorite."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my fave viet places that I go to around my house. I found it by accident a while ago, while visiting a friend at the framing store. I popped in to get take-out and have been back numerous times since.   The inside and decor is really pretty, it's clean and feels very new and modern. The staff is super friendly and the have a huge menu, which I appreciate.   I always get the same thing, I know I'm boring, but hey if it's good might as well stick with it.  I get the lemon grass chicken rice vermicelli. This time Steve came with you and had some sort of beef noodle soup.   The prices are pretty standard and the service is quick. It's not easy to spot, as it's in a corner, but if you are on 16th ave in the area around SAIT, I would def go check it out."}
{"text":"Flawless food and service!!  Authentic food, friendly service and prices that even a student can afford."}
{"text":"My go-to for Vietnamese.  A nice restaurant to eat in and the takeout is always good and consistent.  The staff are very friendly in person and on the phone."}
{"text":"Some majorly fresh pho!  A classy, clean interior and super crisp veg to accompany the phlavourful pho make this one of my phavourite viet spots around pho sho!  In my humble and very opinionated opinion there are three things that make an epic salad roll. 1 - phreshness. The outside isn't dry and tough. 2- the ratio. There's only 3 shrimp, it's a given, so the noodle to shredded lettuce needs to be bang on. 3- phreshness again but this time for the shrimp! Crisp, clean and no phishy taste is the way to go! They nailed it.  Holy Pho! Aside from there being enough of it to pheed a whole phamily, it was totally delicious. Maybe gettin a little high up there on the sodium scale, but really really tasty and enough of it to knock me into a full on phoma.  Heck yes they've got tasty sprouts! I just realized how visibly excited I  about phresh plump bean sprouts... Don't judge me. They're wonderful. When you bend them they snap because they're so phresh."}
{"text":"My friends just recently moved to the city and this was just the closet Vietnamese restaurant to their house. Holy, what a marvelous find. We went with a fairly large group (7-8) and it was easy to find a sitting place. The place was really cozy and cute and our server was ridiculously nice. We ordered salad rolls and jasmine tea to start. The jasmine tea was to die for and the little pot and cups that were served with it, were sooo cute. The salad rolls were super fresh and the peanut sauce was delicious. Pretty much all of us ordered the pho soup. Me and my boyfriend got the spicy beef, and for once it was actually spicy. I loved it. Some of the best pho soup I have had to date. It was also nice that they made vegetarian meals. Two of my friends are vegan and sometimes eating out is a little difficult. Not only did they offer vegan meals but they tasted great. (I don't even like tofu but the tofu pho was really good.  If you are ever near SAIT and are hungry for some Vietnamese, try this place. This place is truly a gem!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here so much that i'm going out of my way to add this new business to Yelp's directory!  Location: Pho Phuong Vi is located where Bailey's Pub used to be in the strip mall next door to Loco Lou's on 16th ave. It's sad that it's hidden in the corner so well. If they can make it through the summer and hook the SAIT students in September, I think they'll make it. Otherwise, not a lot of foot traffic in this area, and by the time traffic sees it, it's too late to turn in.  Price:  Affordable for the quality of the food! My wife and I both had the Grilled Beef & Spring Rolls (#32) for $9.50 + Salad rolls for $5.95  Food:  When they brought the plate out, we were both impressed at how nicely presented it was. The portions are a bit larger than we expected, and the taste of fresh lemon grass (a big part of this meal for me) was perfect! Never too salty.  Also worth mentioning is the Avocado Shake I ordered. It's been about 3 years since i've had a fresh one that a) wasn't sickly sweet and b) didn't taste as though it had been made with old fruit. This is a first for Calgary!  I had forgotten why I love them so much until I came here. Must try them!  Service: Very friendly and prompt. I believe we were served by the owner, who seems kind and thanked us for our business. When the wrong drink was served for my wife who said she liked the order anyway, she insisted on switching it to make her happy.  Atmosphere: The classy and modern decor in here definitely sets it apart from the other affordable Vietnamese restaurants in this city. Lively bright lighting / simple modern decor with several TVs, including a bar. Although we were the only guests at the time it still felt very comfortable.  Overall:  Excellent find in a nondescript location. Fantastic food, good atmosphere and reasonable prices. Definitely plan on being a regular here! I just hope it  can last through the summer!"}
{"text":"Best pho in Calgary! The sweetest staff too!  I have been coming here for the last couple years, and it's still amazing. Sate beef noodle soup, and beef salad rolls are phenomenal. Broth is delicious."}
{"text":"Seems to have gone downhill.... Used to be great. Went on the weekend and salad rolls were much smaller than usual and lacking in ingredients. Tea did not get refilled. Service was poor and food was fairly bland.... Prices seem to have gone up too I used to go out of my way to stop. Not anymore."}
{"text":"Tasty broth. Clean decor. Amazing service. 5 stars.   I've been here twice and this place does not disappoint. Located in a strip mall just off of 16th ave near SAIT, this place gets a lot of foot traffic from the students nearby.  But was this simply because of its prime location? Not at all. I came in with a sense of apprehension but left with a feeling of delight.   Kudos to the delicious pho broth here. The broth had the right combination of flavours with a touch of refreshing sweetness. Portions are great. Prices reasonable. And insider tip, you can pay up front to speed things along.   Haven't had a chance to try the vermicelli bowl here yet but that's going to be next on my bucket list.   Delicious."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! My girlfriend had to stop at the art supply store before we ate, I went in to get us a seat and order. Went to use the washroom and the lady at the front starts yelling at me No no no ! You not a customer you pay before you come in. Unbelievable, this place looks nice inside but the management is horrible. I went to tell my girlfriend what happened and she went in to the restaurant and asked what the problem was, she is totally unapologetic starts yelling \"no no no I don't care, ppl come in here say they pay and they no order\" we left. We are two clean normal looking people, with a wallet full of cash which shouldn't matter anyways. It's discrimination and it's ridiculous. I would never eat there again"}
{"text":"Their chicken satay vermicelli is very tasty! I used to go here all the time on days off from working up north.   The lady got to know me by my order. Then she cracked a joke that I was gonna starve during their summer holidays. It's nice to see some folks with personality around here.   Worth a sit down! Their pho soup is massive."}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place when I work only blocks away! Good pho (chicken was a tad dry), great atmosphere, great service, very clean. You won't believe it from the outside! Overall a great experience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"$47 for two bowls of basic (rare beef pho), salad rolls, chicken wings and Vietnamese coffee.   Was ok but not memorable enough to come back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for dinner when running errands and loved every piece of it!! The spring rolls were jammed packed of meat and light. We also tried their satay salad rolls and loved how tender the meat was. I tried a noodle dish with grilled chicken, grilled pork and grilled shrimp. So here's the deal - a lot of times I order a dish with shrimp, the shrimp is waaaaay overcooked and small. Not here!!!!! The shrimp was juicy and grilled to perfection. My BF has the satay beef pho - the broth is out of the world good! It smelled amazing and was so delicate with a hint of spice.  So delicious- you will not be disappointed and we found a new go-to for Vietnamese that's close to home!!!"}
{"text":"I work a few blocks away from the restaurant.  I'm a big fan of Vietnamese and I'm also a big fan of good service.  I'd rate the food a 4 out of 5 and the service a 5 out of 5.  My only minor complaint with the food is over seasoning from time to time.  Otherwise servings are generous for the price and the food is always fresh.  Furthermore, this restaurant is extremely clean which is a big plus.  Too often restaurants like this can be dirty which is a big turn off.    Should you choose to visit this establishment say hi to the owner who is almost always overseeing things from behind the cash.  She's a very nice and friendly lady."}
