{"text":"Pretty spontaneous decision to come here but I liked it :)

They have a lot of different entrees and specials to go with breakfast and afternoon/dinner menus. 

I decided to go for one of the specials: raisin cinnamon French toast with sunny side up eggs, potatoes and bacon (bacon wasn't pictures, found their way to my friends plate lol). As part of the special, you get the choice of tea or coffee, as well as a small glass of juice. 

The food was good but nothing really too special and it was just over $12, including tax. I think I wanna come back and try out some of the other stuff there so I think I'll recommend it :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 15 years.  Just like any other restaurant there are bad, in my opinion, experiences ranging from servers to the food itself.

I like the breakfast and love the sausages.  The omelette choices are extensive and they will even remove an ingredient ( I don't like green peppers ) if you ask them.  I stay away from the hash browns which are never cooked enough for my liking.  Although you can ask to have them well cooked and sometimes they will do that for you.  

I ordered the spaghetti and meat balls at one time.  I can't place my finger on it but there's something not right about the meat.  Needless to say, I shy away from the meat balls. 
The hamburgers are juicy and tasty and will leave you full.  

There are a few serves who are slightly in need of an attitude adjustment but isn't that the case in other restaurants?  Most are ok and make your experience enjoyable.

Try this place despite the other reviews and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Great Mom and Pop restaurant at the corner of king and hurontario in Mississauga
I have been up and down this menu when it comes to there breakfast and have never been disappointed. Great for lunch and dinner
Definitely a must try!!!
Service is at par but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Meh

Service was fine 

$13.44 plus tip for bacon, 2 eggs, rye toast (+.95Â¢) and coffee.

It tasted fine but.. Meh."}
{"text":"Great service the waitresses are all very friendly and welcoming. Really feels like you are over at family's house. You know cousins or the inlaws but in a good way. 
The place has been in Mississauga for as long as I can remember which shows they are doing something right.

I would recommend you visit. It is a restaurant that is simply for the food. Lots to choose from and seasonal specials and all day breakfast, All Day BREAKFAST!!!!
It is a simple restaurant that visually will not blow you away but is worth a visit or two."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Orchard since I was a baby. The breakfast here is what you want to put in your face after a night of drinking. The staff is super nice and remind you of your nana, and if your lucky you might even get to meet the owner who kinda looks like Stan Lee. 
Good bang for your buck. Everything made fresh and nothing is frozen."}
{"text":"We went there for Mother's Day and it was absolutely horrible.
1. The waitress yelled at me when I asked if I could substitute eggs because I can't eat them.
2. The syrup and butter were stained and the plate they came on was dirty.
3. She never asked us how our meals were or if we needed anything else.
4. The food had no flavor and was extremely greasy.
5. The bill was put on our table before we even got half way through our food. When we asked to order a refill she made it a big deal because she had to take the bill back and alter it.

The only positive thing I can say is, there was a short wait. And that's it. 

I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. Like EVER."}
{"text":"Food was subpar and the guy at the counter shoved my change into my hand... weird vibe weird attitude...."}
{"text":"Traveling from Toronto to Mississauga for brunch yesterday morning was worth the drive to Orchard Family Restaurant.  Arriving at 11:30 am, the restaurant was already busy but my friend and I were seated within minutes.  

I ordered the Eggs Florentine and my friend ordered a plate that came with french toast, sausage, bacon and eggs any way you like them.  With hefty portions of fresh, home style, skillet potatoes accompanying both our meals, neither of us could finish!  To our delight, none of the food was prepackaged, frozen or uniform but rather farm to table fresh!

Our server LIZA was personable, attentive, friendly and professional.  If you're lucky to get her service, she's a pro that could probably teach other servers how to create an experience for customers, not just take orders and serve food :)

Our coffee was served within one minute of ordering and our meals arrived in under 6 minutes.  Our meals were made to order and my compliments were relayed to the chef, Liza and the owner.

If you're looking for delicious, fresh food, friendly, fast service in a family style atmosphere, where the owners are not only a visible presence but working along side their staff, I highly recommend Orchard Family Restaurant.  This place is definitely as good as it gets!  I'll definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Does a one star restaurant deserve a full review?

Well, I should at least explain why it receives a single star from me.  How about dirty plates?  Very dirty plates.

On the coffee mug, a faded pink lipstick mark.  On my breakfast plate, dried egg yolk from the previous customer.

Yuk.  Clean up your act.. and your plates."}
{"text":"This place needs to add vegan friendly options to an increasingly compassionate and health conscious clientele. Thank you for the consideration!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was 4 since I lived in an apartment nearby. The good is good and decently priced but I have no patience for bad service. The hosts were rude and so are a majority of the waitresses. I even saw one of the hosts pick his butt wedgie. When he lead my mother and I to our table, he just threw or menus on the table and walked away. Not even a \"have a nice meal\" or \"enjoy your food\". The servers who are nice are kind, like aunties who want to feed you haha. I think it's lucky their food is good or I probably wouldn't come back here though. I understand it's been a staple for decades but that doesn't mean that they can't seek to improve themselves."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what possessed me to walk in here. 

I didn't think I could be served a lower quality of food aside from Denny's. And then POOF , the waitress places down a plate of what seemed to be the 2eggs any style i ordered...but on steroids. .1 serving can feed 3 people. 

The waitresses are older ladies that chit chat so \"service\" is not a priority . Expect to wait ...for everything. I guess I can understand, since majority of the repeat customers are locals and old bingo players gathering around ordering tacky flower print mugs of bagged tea/coffee for half the afternoon. 

The restaurant is medium sized with almost all wood furniture. The cashier stand is the same place as the hostess. This creates a confusing traffic for people waiting to pay and waiting to be seated.

If my car broke down and none of my friends were alive and i had no money and couldn't prostitute myself - then.. MAYBE I'd consider making a return visit.

{"text":"Family atmosphere. Breakfast spot located at Hurontario and Dundas. Parking lot gets full on weekends. Our waitress was 5 stars. Friendly, offered reccomendations, explained wait times for food being 5 mins MAX, unless you order a well done steak....

Food seriously did come quick! Ordered the spinach florentine and added breakfast ham. Did not regret this game-time decision. It was HUGE and overlapped the tiny english muffins.

Will ask for homefries to be well-done next time, as they were slightly under-cooked to my liking. Soft instead of crispy. Coffee could be better, but gracious and attentive with refills.

Food 3/5
Service 5/5"}
{"text":"Orchard Restaurant is pretty much THE place to go in Mississauga for breakfast. Even if you don't like it, you've probably been to it at least once - it's the landmark at the corner of \"Five and Ten\" (Hurontario and Dundas). Anybody who's anybody eats here. Mayor Hazel McCallion has made it a regular stop. I've had committee meetings and social get-togethers here. It's almost like a rite of passage if you're a local resident.

Of course, it sticks out like a sore thumb because of its retro decor, but the food has always kept me coming back. While the prices can err a bit on the pricey side for bigger breakfast items, the food is always delicious and you get generous portions. Whenever I go, I usually get the \"Mississauga Platter\" (which is basically eggs and all the fixings) or the \"Cluck Cluck Benedict\" (eggs benedict with a chicken breast), which always makes me laugh when I order it.

The menu is by-and-large the standard diner fare, and the staff are reasonably courteous given the high volume of people who come through (just don't look at the cooks behind the grill - they look like they'd rather be somewhere else).

Orchard is a place you go more for the experience than anything else. It's consistent enough in quality to recommend, though I'd stick to the breakfast hours and avoid the loud screaming kids with their parents at dinner service."}
{"text":"i'm here pretty much every Sunday!  good eats, great service.... my apologies for the pic!  i was hangry...."}
{"text":"Amazing place with great service and the best homemade soups. The service is pretty good. If you're looking for a great soup then don't look any further"}
{"text":"Another greasy spoon, been in business for god knows how many years. their breakfast is okay, bur most of their other food are horrible, except corn beef or roast beef sandwich its was really good 

Tips order Hot (warm) roast beef sandwich"}
{"text":"I love coming here.  It reminds of the places my grandpa used to take me.

The decor is dated, but let's be finest it's clean and you are here for the food.

The staff are nice and very personable.

Stay for the food, stay more for the more food.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate greasy spoon hangover breakfast spot in Mississauga.  It's usually packed on the weekends but seating is quick and the food doesn't take long to prepare.  Being a picky eater, I appreciate the multitude of breakfast selections and combos on the menu.  Prices are very reasonable.  Service is lackluster and leaves something to be desired, but is very much what one might expect from a rundown diner.  Overall good and I would return!"}
{"text":"always love coming here..food is good and staff are all nice...love the omelettes..good food at affordable prices...if you're looking for good breakfast and good service this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"Busy spot close to Dundas and 10.  Seated promptly and friendly staff.

Ordered omelettes and coffee.  Good breakfast with perfectly cooked omelettes, hash browns, and toast  with jam and bottomless cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I have been there twice once for a steak dinner which was so so and once for a liver and onions which was good ,but really surprised me is that they don't offer free refills on soft drinks , I mean it comes from a fountain Device , I had to cough up some more money just to finish my meal ,"}
{"text":"Noooooo!!!!!!! What happened to one of my favourites?! Had a 12oz Steak with home fries, veges and salad. T'was dissapointingly watery. The medium-rare was extreamly soggy, the veges were just carrots and boiled leaks, the dinner roll was dry as hell. I can only compliment the salad. Pretty sure the chef has changed."}
{"text":"Classic family restaurant. Cheap with large portions, have never left unsatisfied. Waitresses are attentive and nice. Food is always above average and consistent. Solid staple in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Great Burgers on top of great breakfast"}
{"text":"It was first time try this restaurant. 
Parking lot was great food was not so bad.
Me anf my wife is not big eater so we didnt really care anout potion of the food. However if u are you wont be happy. It was nust perfect for me.

Table was dirty server did not clean the table and put my coffee on that dirty table. Spend 20 min to finish never come back again ask or refill coffee. There 5 server was here doesnt even seem busy. 
Even if food was not bad i m not comig back here..
Terrianle service."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! If you like to overpay for your breakfast and still walk out hungry, this is not the place for you. HUGE portions - perfectly prepared eggs (no runny whites) - very good coffee. All for a good price Coffee & juice were included in the special (under $10!). This will be our breakfast place whenever we're in the Mississauga area."}
{"text":"Perfectly decent all-day breakfast place that is a fixture in the Cooksville area of Mississauga. It's been there for as long as I can remember and probably won't be going anywhere anytime soon, at least I hope not...it's been there for fifty years, longer than Mississauga has been a city! Besides, anyone and everyone who's everyone (wait, does that makes sense?) in the 'Sauga goes there for breakfast and that includes former mayor, Hazel McCallion...she was there on one of my last visits and made sure to give me a commemorative McCallion medallion (or whatever)!

It's pretty much your standard diner fare, good quality grub with big portions for a reasonable price. They even make a pretty decent Eggs Florentine for fancy-pants people like me. Service is perhaps a little gruff at time, but again, look where you are. That's the name of the game or at least should be...oh for the days of the surly waitress with the cigarette dangling from her lip growling \"more coffee, Hun?\"

So while it may not be amazing, it is part of the essential Mississauga experience. Wait, there's such a thing? If not, I just made it up and it includes Orchard."}
{"text":"Love coming to this old school diner!  Went the other day for brunch and had the Deuce's Wild breakfast combo, cheap and just enough food, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 eggs and homefries were filling....would recommend getting the french fries over the home fries...also had freshly squeezed grapefruit juice that was delicious."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Orchard for over 20 years. The portions are big, the service is fast and the food consistently good. Love coming here for breakfast, I'm not a huge fan of eggs, but I crave their eggs! Buttery and never over cooked. Their twisted chicken sandwich, souvlaki dinner and anniversary special are always a good choice. If you have room and it's available, get the coconut cream pie, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"A popular all-day breakfast spot with a range of family dining options. Good service, decent food, larger portions, fair quality. The 'anniversary' special was a great deal for a weekend family lunch."}
{"text":"Decent prices and extra generous portions. The menu is not as extensive as most breakfast places but it's good enough. And though I'm not hugely impressed with their basic items, their benedicts are great and the sausages are huge and delicious. The service is also always great."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast on our way back to the US from Toronto.  

We had a good experience unlike other yelpers.  It was very busy, our waitress made it a point to apologize for our wait, coffee was good and kept getting refilled, portions were large, price reasonable it's a diner type place so if you don't want to eat at a greasy spoon stay away, but it was perfect for what I wanted."}
{"text":"Came here for all day breakfast. Had the eggs benny.
Food was good, and service was good.no complaints"}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place, I finally went to check it out with my friend who is a regular. We both decided to treat ourselves and shared their daily specials: fisherman's platter (sole, shrimp, scallops) and sweet and sour ribs. Both came with an appetizer (soup or salad), a drink, and dessert. We both chose their soup of the day. 

We were seated very quickly when we arrived around noon. It was very busy and loud at the restaurant. You could tell that business was good. The soup was VERY filling (for a soup), and that's coming from someone who will eat 3 people portions. Don't underestimate the small portion. The barley was very thick and filling.  When our main course arrived, we were already pretty full. 

The fish could have been cooked better in my opinion. The tartar sauce was pretty disappointing. It was like I was eating mayo- I couldn't taste any of the pickles or sourness it usually would have. The shrimp and scallops were delicious with the seafood sauce! I love how they were fried - not too greasy. I asked for crispy house fries but they weren't really crispy aside from a few pieces. It was rather mushy. 

The ribs were alright. The sauce was good but the meat wasn't warm, as if it had just been sitting there for a good while. However, the meat was very tender and practically fell off the bone clean. 

Overall, the portions were more than generous but definitely on the pricier side. I feel that they should offer smaller portions and adjust prices for that. I'm the type to eat everything put out in front of me until I absolutely can't. This meal definitely took a while to finish. We spent about 2 hours (including waiting time and chatting) and there were still leftovers. Regardless, I'll definitely come back to try their anniversary special and other breakfast menu items."}
{"text":"There's a reason this all-day breakfast & diner has survived at Hurontario & Dundas in the heart of Mississauga since 1966.  That is, good food reasonably priced and FAST service.  Great for families, I brought my daughter here when she was a baby and she's 25 now. We don't live in the neighbourhood anymore but we always find a reason to drive back here on the weekend. And hurrah! Orchard never changes. They don't NEED to change a thing either : )"}
{"text":"This spot certainly lacks bells and whistles, however that rather makes the ambiance feel homey and comforting.  I used to frequent this restaurant with co-workers every Monday morning when I worked out in Mississauga and the breakfast certainly hit the spot.  I would normally ask for the french toast and it was always prepared crispy on the exterior and fluffy inside without being overly dense or mushy. The food itself wasn't out of this world but always consistent! Service was normally prompt and helpful."}
{"text":"Good prices here, huge pancakes available.  The place is a bit \"breakfast diner\"ish, which is fine since it is a breakfast diner.  My only probelm is that our server seemed a little impatient.  The service was fine, but could use a little more friendliness.  

Anyways, this place is nothing special.  But if you're in the area, try it out and you'll get exactly what you expect when you're walking in.  No big surprises here.

{"text":"The portions are great and you get good value for your money. Service is good and speedy. I highly recommend the big combo breakfast special."}
{"text":"Lunch with my family and friends on Easter . Full restaurant and friendly staff. 
I ordered the roast beef after the food arrived. ..the food is cold , no taste . After I finish my cold food , the underneath my roast beef I see the soggy breads . For $13.99 I think is to pricey with the food they serve you."}
{"text":"This owner who has been there for 50 years, hasn't even got the decency to give a rebate to seniors (the place is surrounded by retirement homes, there is always older poeple in there). Most of them are poor so I really don't understand that. Also for a simple 'family' style restaurant, a greek salad with chicken is 20$, which IS expensive and the taste is average. Oh did I  mention no bottomless coffee??  nope, max is two small cups(not a mug which could be double in size) for the price. Thats why I had to give him 1 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"One of the nicest places to grab breakfast with family or friends in Mississauga. If you get there early on a weekend, get there earlier, as there might be a line. Even if there is, it is generally pretty fast, but when you're hungry a minute turns into an hour in your mind, and nobody likes a grumpy customer!  They have a good selection of breakfast and lunch deals. Favorites are the Peameal sandwich and the Eggs Benedict (any one). The prices are reasonable and service has always been good, fast and friendly. Definitely will keep visiting, any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon, around noon. The place was packed. Both inside and outside on the patio. However, we were quickly seated in a vacant booth inside. 

After waiting nearly 20 minutes for our server, we ordered coffee. Another 5 mins later; we finally got our menus. (They ask you if you want menus; I am assuming this is because the regulars know what they want already). We ordered Pancakes, Cinnamon Raisin french toast, eggs, bacon, potatoes & sausage. 

Let me just say that not only did the food come out rather quickly (I dont know if it just felt quick or if it was actually quick; cause I literally grew a beard waiting for my menu) but the food was WICKEEED. literally the best breakfest sausages I have personally ever had. Coras/Sunset/ANY other breakfest place does not compare. Cinnamon french toast, really good (they use raisin bread). Pancakes were so/so, I have had better.. scrambled eggs were delicate and fluffy. Just rating the food, id give it a 4/5. was a very good and filling breakfest for $9.75!!

Where this place lost stars.. I watched our waitress blatantly ignore a customer who asked a her a question. WAIT time was horrible, we almost left.. they were busy, but 20 minutes to be greeted after already being seated, not acceptable. By the time we were 3/4 done our meal the waitress threw the bill on the table; \"no rush\" she said, with a line up of 20 people behind her. 

I would return for the food though, the lackluster customer service was tolerable for the quality of the food. It was really that good (breakfest anyways)."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is just PERFECT. Every time I come down to have breakfast they will not disappoint me. Portion is considered to be large and the quality is great. Coffee is fresh and hot.This historical restaurant is definitely one of the best place to go if you are looking for some great breakfast."}
