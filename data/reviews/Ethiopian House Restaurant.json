{"text":"This was my second time eating Ethiopian food and my friend recommended this place. We shared three main dishes amongst the three of us. 

I enjoyed having a taste of all the food but I felt that I was mostly filled up on oil and not substance. Also there wasn't much difference between the dishes; a few stood out though it got tiring at the end. I did enjoy the bread though; it was nice and moist with a little bit of sour taste. (like sourdough bread?)

Service wasn't very good as we waited a long time for water, ordering and the bill. The tablecloths are also pretty gross since there's leftover food other people spilled all over it.

It was a good experience for trying new foods but I'd rather go somewhere else to fill up and leave a smaller dent in my wallet."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time I'm satisfied, but not blown away. The service is very slow, so I recommend eating at Ethiopian House with folks you like talking with. Otherwise, much awkward silence will ensue. Although service is slow, they waitstaff are very nice, the portions are generous and the prices are appropriate. I never leave hungry."}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times and every time I am more than happy with the food.  I love the whole concept of eating with your hands if only our server last night actually brought napkins and wet naps to the table it would have been a more enjoyable eating experience.  The restaurant was busy so we had a hard time getting her attention until after we finished eating and by that time our hands and mouths needed a good wipe down.  It was disappointing to have such bad service especially when you are not eating with utensils.
I had the veggie sampling platter which I thought was good but lacked the spicy punch you get from the beef dishes which I enjoy far more.  My girlfriend ordered a meat sample platter which I enjoyed more than what I ordered.  They brought both of our meals on one giant platter to share.  I do like this concept and think its fun way to eat which is probably why I keep going back with different people.
We asked for soup as an appetizer and we were literally laughed at for asking which was beyond weird.  I didn't know that was a funny thing to ask for.  Apparently they don't have soup but other Ethiopian restaurants do and its very good.  We also asked for jalapeno poppers which is on the menu and again were laughed at for asking as if we knew they didn't have any already.  The service was very weird last night but the food made up for it.
I will go again and hopefully get better service."}
{"text":"I went all the way walking to this place , hoping it to be open bsed on yelp timings. But it was closed"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic hidden gem! Service was great and the food was incredible! The flavors were amazing and had great vegan options. A must-have for any visit to Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place is just all over \"meh\". The food is edible but leaves a lot to be desired. I would have given it three stars had it not been as expensive as it was. My majour complaint is that it is definitely NOT worth the price.  

Service is friendly but inattentive. We waited for a very long time to even receive menus or water despite being seated by our server. Don't wait for your bill to come to you because it probably won't."}
{"text":"I've only been to a few Ethiopian restaurants, and this is my first in Toronto. I've always adored the cuisine, spicy dishes all centered around the unique injera bread. The communal aspects of the Ethiopian dining experience bring people together and make the food the center of attention.

I was not disappointed by anything at the Ethiopian House, aside from a lack of tej, which is a legal issue with the LCBO (sigh), so you can't get it anywhere, but there are recipes! :D  Tej is an amazing hopped mead that is the perfect match of sweet and bitter with loads of alcohol that you can't even taste, the ideal compliment to the deep, earthy flavours in the food.

Remodeled from a lovely old house, the tables are a bit tight, but it felt as warm and inviting as the luxurious aromas from the kitchen. I was impressed at how well our waitress was handling the whole restaurant by herself, including mending a skipping CD so we didn't feel like it was a Nobukazu Takemura concert (I like Nobukazu btw ;).

The beef tibs was amazing; spicy and robust, the tartar kitfo was subtle yet sublime.  All of the vegetarian options were delicious, the split red and yellow lentils, the collard greens, a bean dish which I hadn't tried before and lots more. I suggest getting the mixer plates, everything is good and you get the full spectrum of the cuisine. Some may balk at the spicy raw steak tartar, but it's a truly classic Ethiopian dish, and I promise it won't kill you. 

The coffee seemed to be taking a while after the meal was done, and they say that it takes 30-45 minutes to properly prepare Ethiopian coffee.  It's a very involved process of roasting and crushing beans by hand and it results in some really nice coffee, which is similar to Armenian and Hungarian coffee traditions but not as strong.

All of this wonderful food, and it was plenty for everyone, was had for $20 a person minus drinks. A fantastic deal for some really quality food. I will certainly try other Ethiopian places in Toronto, but I wouldn't hesitate to come back here anytime."}
{"text":"Amazing food, very laid back at home feel atmosphere. I come here almost every other week and love it!"}
{"text":"The first time I ever tried Ethiopian food was from here and I have loyally been back many times since. 

SERVICE: Always friendly but it may take a while to get food. I think this has to do with the preparation as everything is always so fresh. 

ATMOSPHERE: Relatively quiet on weekdays but a bit busy on weekends. The decor is very authentic and even has some naked boobies hanging around on the wall...if you're interested.

FOOD: Love it!! I always get the meat combo on Injera. The meat is super flavorful and when the sauce soaks into the bread...ohh my!! Also I love eating with my hands and enjoyed the Ethiopian beer that they had available. Ive always wanted to try their coffee that comes with popcorn but I'm always so full after my meal.

Overall, interesting experience and well worth the money."}
{"text":"This was my first Ethiopian experience. We always order the vegetarian platter because it seems like the best value in terms of quantity of food. :-) It's also quite good for meat eaters as well. I'd give them five stars, but sometimes the service is slow. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Try the injera-a large rice hopper on which various kinds of meats and veggies are served along with their gravies-absolutely yummy!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place about a year ago with a friend of ours. Started eating once a month there. It has now got to a point where in this has become one of the must-try spots for anyone coming to meet us from outside.

If you are up for something spicy then do try the Senig Karia - Its worth it.
The coffee is amazing. Love the whole act."}
{"text":"Last night was my second visit here. I remember enjoying the food the first time I was there over a year ago. This time was very disappointing. My husband ordered the meat platter, a combo of items 9 to 11 and I had the veggie platter, a combo of 8 items. First off, the portions were too small for the price. The only meat dish that we enjoyed was the tibs. In the vegetarian options, most of the dishes were bland. Hardly any flavour at all. Service was a bit slow. Overall, my takeaway is to try different Ethiopian places with more flavourful food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places downtown for Ethiopian food. I've been there three times for dinner and I highly recommend it.

Definitely go for the dishes to share that allows you to sample the variety of the vegetarian and meat dishes that are on the menu.

I love the pancake like bread that you eat the food with.  Just make sure you wash your hands before you start eating since there are no utensils.

The ambiance is a low key casual type of restaurant and the prices are reasonable (around $50-$60 for a meal for 3). If you want high end fine dining, this isn't the right place for you.

I don't recall having any problems with the service.

Overall, I think this is a good restaurant for ethiopian food. The only other place i have tried is the Blue Nile in Montreal and it is equally as good."}
{"text":"The lunch special here is a fantastic deal. I admit I am not an expert on Ethiopian food, but for first- or second-timers this place does not seem to disappoint. Service was great, and the injera is wonderfully spongy. Glad to have this establishment so close to Yonge-Wellesley."}
{"text":"The space was too tight and i was not a big fan of the food
There was a very weird spice somewhere in my meat"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing, the service is friendly & the price is great-especially the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I am definitely biased because I am somewhat of a regular here, but as I'm new to Yelp, I felt the need to weigh in.

I've tried Ethiopian at many different places in the city, as well as in Vancouver, New York City and Seattle. None are as good as Ethiopian House. The flavours are complex and and the dishes are consistently delicious (my favourites are the cabbage and the collards). Ask for some cheese to top it off and the stuffed jalapenos add a nice bite to your meal.

The service is always wonderful and warm. Prices are a little higher than some of the other places in town, but it's worth it for the higher quality food and lovely service. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Was excited to venture out to my beloved Ethiopian House on a recent trip back to Toronto...and found myself incredibly disappointed. 

Ordered the Vegetarian Bayanatuu for 2 and a side of Tibs. The portion sizes were small (ridiculously small), the food was bland and worse, undercooked.  The prices were still high...too high for a meal that was sub-par at best. 

The restaurant was EMPTY so my friend and I asked if we could sit at a larger table with a bit more space to stretch out. The server said No. We suggested that if they ended up needing the table, we'd move to a smaller one. Still NO. After that, we saw the waitress exactly twice -- once to take our order and once to bring it. No check to see how we were doing, no refills on drinks (which we both wanted to order)... We needed more Injera and never ended up being able to order it.

25 minutes after we finished our meal, I had to walk into the kitchen and holler for the waitress to bring us our check. The restaurant was still empty but for one table of 2 that had come in as we were finishing eating.

The bill ended up being $35 and change for lunch. We left hungry and deeply disappointed."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. We ordered 2 portions of meat and veggies, which was MORE than enough for two. The only thing I hope they would do in the future is label each dish so I would know what I'm tasting because they kind of tasted the same and I was unaware what I was consuming. We ordered the coffee to try and it came in a nice presentation. 

Now that I've tasted the food I might come here for take-out in the future."}
{"text":"I have had Ethiopian food at many different restaurants around Canada, and although they had a great selection and the service was great, the food could've been better.

There is a lot of seating available if the bottom floor gets busy they have a whole other floor upstairs.

I love Ethiopian bread and their bread had the perfect consistency, the thing that threw all of us off was the fact that the bread was cold, I've only ever been served ingera bread warm before.

The food wasn't spicy at all we ordered the vegetarian platter lunch special and it almost seemed bland to me, all other Ethiopian restaurants I have been to seemed to have much spicier and more flavourful food.

There are a lot of options here for vegans and vegetarians, if my memory serves me correctly they had 9 options for vegetarians/vegans."}
{"text":"I like this place, they have some good vege. dishes.
I would only go here once a month.

Lots of my friends didnt find it apetizing.... I think it was because it was very soggy....
besides that, its price worthy.

Go there, check it out and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Food was grey, flavourless and there was hardly more than 5 small cubes of meat in my meal. 

I ordered a dish which came served on their sponge bread, the sauce had a few pieces of flavourless, tough meat mixed in with the same bread in a sauce. It was served with a side of bread. 

So essentially I was served bread on bread with a side of bread. All grey. All disgusting. 

I will NEVER be back. What an awful experience."}
{"text":"Colourful combo plate of vegg and beef dishes was very tasty and filling for under $20 for 2. Worth the 2km walk from downtown. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We have been to Ethiopian restaurants before, but always wanted to check out this place in down-town. Since our friend came visiting it was perfect to introduce her the Ethiopian food. 

We arrived around 2 PM and the place was empty in a May afternoon. We knew what we wanted, so ordering was easy for us. Server was this original yah-man wearing reggae apparel. It took some time for our food to arrive. It was okay, not as good as in some other Ethiopian restaurant we have been. 

The décor is interesting, something you do not see everywhere and yes, it can be a bit dingy, but it is okay when you want to explore a new place."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food, and have sampled Ethiopian restaurants all over the city.  Whereas, I still think that *perhaps* Lalibela (West) is the best - Ethiopian House comes in close second.  It is not as cheap as Nazarath, or as authentic as Dukem, but it has nice enough atmosphere and its a fun place to have dinner with a friend or lunch with coworkers.

I have to give this place a rating because it is close to my office, and we come here for lunch on occasion. And even though it is slow, we are still in and fed and out in an hour. The lunch specials are fantastic and great value for Y&B office workers. Veggie is in the $7-8 range and filling.

I judge all Ethiopian on the quality of their Mesir Wat  (my favorite dish) and here it doesn't disappoint.  They take plastic, but I suggest to bring cash if you want to be back at your desk within the hour."}
{"text":"Good prices and very good portion sizes, but overall I've had better Ethiopian food. The flavours just didn't meet my standards, and the cuts of beef used seemed to be a little too tough for me compared to the same dishes at other similar restaurants. I almost found the vegetarian platter to be overly greasy, more so than other Ethiopian or Eritrean restaurants I've been to and the level of oil just didn't agree with my stomach. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"So this was only my 3rd time eating Ethiopian food (1st at Ethiopian House). My only other experience was at Lalibela and I have to say, Lalibela was far better. Not only were the prices and service better, but more importantly, the food was too. At Ethiopian House, I shared the veggie mixed platter (decent. I've had better) and the gored gored (stewed beef). The beef literally tasted like burnt spices. It was actually inedible. Our server was a funny, sweet guy but the food service was slow. I wouldn't return"}
{"text":"When we get visitors to the city who want to try something different, the Ethiopian House is usually on my list.

For the eclectic atmosphere, convenient location, and friendly staff, the Ethiopian House stands out. Highly recommended when you're bringing visitors to experience Ethiopian food for the first time, since the food isn't too spicy or too strange for most.

A good place for vegetarians and for those who want to take their guests for a communal dinner experience where plates or cutlery aren't needed at all."}
{"text":"Dépaysement, bière kényane et mets authentiques qui se dégustent à la main en piochant avec un bout d'injera. J'y retournerai pour le plaisir de goûter a cette cuisine que j'ignorais depuis trop longtemps."}
{"text":"I love eating with my hands.  It is such a sensual way to enjoy an exotic meal.  I appreciate that the Ethiopian House restaurant encourages customers to use their hands for the full experience.

The menu was extensive with a great selection for vegetarians.  I went with my gut and ordered Tibs.  The pan fried beef sauteed with onions, garlic and awaze.  It was finger-licking good.  Normally, I don't like injera, but it was the perfect compliment to Tibs.  Especially the part that was completely soaked with all the spicy juices.

Not familiar with words like awaze or berbere?  No sweat.  Look for \"Do you know what it means?\" on the menu.  I found the information very useful.

The cultural ambiance, the attentive service and the food -- everything was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love this place; veggie combo is the best, bathrooms are clean, it is so cozy and decorated so lovely and it has such an awesome smell in the restaurant- like erotic in scents. I dunno what else to say I love it."}
{"text":"Really authentic and delicious East African food at a great price. Nice to go when sharing with friends. 

The space is a little dated but you don't go here for a swanky lounge or happening bar. It's about the food. And the food speaks for itself. 

If East African food isn't your thing then it's no big deal, but this place does it well."}
{"text":"I've been going here for the last 10 years and it has become comfort food to me. It has never changed and I don't want it to. It feels like you're dining at someone's eclectic home complete with National Geographic-like photos of Ethiopia on the walls.

I regularly order the vegetarian byanatuu for two. It's perfect for sharing and well priced. It's not world class Ethiopian but its solid and reliable. Every time I try somewhere else, I always miss the way this place cuts the veggies and the spice ratio. Like Mom's cooking in that it's not the best food but you miss it when someone does the same thing differently. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this restaurant for many years but lately my experiences have been becoming more and more sad. After the most recent occasion I may not return again.

FOOD

I usually have to wait 35 to 45 minutes for an order here whether they are busy or empty and have never complained about it because the taste was good. This time we were served in under ten minutes and with good reason. The food was obviously leftovers which had been microwaved for us. It wasn't even hot.

The Goren Be Sega which is supposed to be a buttery beef dish with collard greens had exactly 5 pieces of beef, less than 1cm cubed, and the collard greens were limp. There was no detectable butter flavor.

The Ethiopean tea that was served had barely detectable flavor and no cardamon cinnamon or clove pieces, just a sort of strange powder. Again, scraping the barrel.

SERVICE

The service has always been a little strange here but I accepted it due to the excellent food. We were a table of 2 which grew to a table of 3 before any food or drinks had arrived. We requested to move to a larger table near by and were denied. There was only one other occupied table in the whole place! and it was late enough that no new tables of people were likely to arrive. After the food was served we were so crowded with plate and cups and saucers that my friend had to place one of her drinks on the next table anyway. The waitress frowned.

The waitress also frowned and condescended to us when we asked for more injera. I had my payment on the table for twenty minutes without anyone coming to get it and I had to go to the kitchen alcove in order to summon someone to take my money. 

I am willing to put up with a lot for great food but now there is neither good food or even passable service. So sad."}
{"text":"Certainly enjoyed a filling lunch at the Ethiopian House. Wash your hands because it's all finger food - and soooo good! Ranges in spice from very spicy to mild. The coffee is delicious and the environment quaint. The combination of lunch specials (we had vegetarian and meat specials together) were easy on the wallet and filling! Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Great Ethiopian food. The injera is amazing as is the vegetarian plate. You can order a plate for 1 or 2 people. They also have lots of meat options. The servers are unpredictable. Either very good or non-existent but at the end of the day you get your food. There is a small patio which is always busy. Ethiopian food is heavy so don't eat before and don't eat too much for a more enjoyable event. Order your Ethiopian coffee at the beginning of your meal so it is ready. Very flavourful and comes with popcorn."}
{"text":"My husband and I were meeting a friend for dinner and decided to try this Ethiopian place. Both my husband and I are not huge fans of Ethiopian cuisine - I certainly enjoy it more than he does. We both love Indian cuisine and often find the Ethiopian food too close to the Indian flavors to be able to enjoy it without comparing it to similar Indian dishes.

For appetizers, we ordered the Senig Karia, which is basically jalapenos stuffed with tomatoes and onions. Funnily, the appetizers came after our entrees. Honestly, I didn't like this dish much. I would have liked my jalapenos to be maybe roasted or baked. To me, raw jalapenos don't add too much flavor unless they are thrown into some dish. The stuffing was also quite meh to me. But my husband loved the jalapeno and the stuffing. So really, just go with your preferences.

For entrees, my husband had the chicken stew, which was super delicious. They weren't joking when they said that this is their most popular dish. The chicken was spicy, tender, and it easily came off the bones. The gravy was super delicious as well. My husband and I are chicken-lovers, so the one big disappointment was the lack of chicken options in their menu. This was really the only chicken dish they had. Everything else was a vegetarian or beef dish.

I had the Sherro Wot, which is chickpea powder in berbere sauce. It was somewhat under-seasoned and did not have enough salt, but after a few bites, I was able to enjoy it more. Both entrees came with injera, which is Ethiopian bread, more like a pancake or a dosa than a bread. I was quite surprised that I was able to finish my dish - I've returned home from many an Ethiopian restaurant with about a quarter to half of my plate boxed.

There seemed to be just one lady serving, seating, and taking orders. You could see that she was getting overwhelmed - we had to wait a long time to place our orders, our appetizers came too late, and no one came around to give our bill. The restaurant itself is very cramped. Our table was too small to seat three, so we were constantly moving glasses and plates around to make space."}
{"text":"Avoid ! Mediocre service, dirty washrooms, the food ? Worst Ethiopian I've ever had in the city. Had to fish for the main ingredient in the dish. Never again."}
{"text":"Really excellent food - hearty and delicious portions including a broad selection of veggie dishes.  The nature of the cuisine lends itself well to sampling / sharing.  Had the veggie platter and enjoyed everything.  

Service was good and the atmosphere was lively but still allowed for conversation. 

Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"In short, the food was pretty good, but the service wasn't great.  It was worth trying, but I don't think I'll be going back any time soon.

MUST TRY WHEN THERE: Ethiopian Tea Ceremony

Warning: it comes with some pretty strong incense.  After a while, the whole floor filled with smoke and there didn't seem to be any ventilation.

The tea was different in flavour and was very strong.  I enjoyed the coffee quite a bit.

At first it seems kind of weird that there's popcorn served with it, but it actually goes really well with the Ethiopian coffee.

FOOD: 
I liked the vegetarian items that they had; they were quite tasty.  Even my husband, who is NOT a fan of vegetables, liked the vegetarian parts of the meal. And the presentation is beautiful.

I wasn't sure what to expect from the injero.  So here's my take on injero, it is kind of like a mix between a pita and naan but with the consistency and texture of a pancake.  It was pretty good, but I can't eat too much of it.

Overall, it was pretty good, but not something I would crave.  I found that after a while, it all tasted the same.

SERVICE:
Maybe because it was a Saturday night, the service was pretty bad.  I'm not sure if she understood English... we asked for side plates, and they never came.  We asked for one plate per person, and she brought one plate... so we gave up on asking for plates.  Normally I don't mind having to ask a few times, but I just felt like it was reallllllly hard to communicate with the server other than putting in an order.

The server kept filling up the water glasses of 2 out of 7 people in our party and then took the pitcher away and didn't bring it back.  We asked for more water, and we saw the pitcher get filled, but then it just sat on the counter.  Eventually one of the people from my table got up and got it themself.

So overall, I was not impressed with the service at all.  Nothing was really explained; it was our first time trying Ethiopian food so we wanted to get clarification on what some of the items were, but wasn't really told anything except that one of them was beef and the other chicken."}
{"text":"Ethiopian House is a reasonably good Ethiopian restaurant.

Ethiopian food is one of those things that you either love or don't care for at all.  Ethiopian House's menu provides a good intro into the food but it is nowhere near as extensive or authentic (so I hear) as some of the other Ethiopian establishments in the city.

If you're in the area and crave Ethiopian it is a good choice.  If you're willing to travel a little there are others that are worth exploring."}
{"text":"I am sad to say I did not enjoy my experience here. I was excited to try something new but it was not what I had hoped for. Keep in mind this is my first Ethiopian food experience.

We order a meat and veggie platter. It took a long time to arrive and when it did I was disappointed by the portions. Very little of everything. The first time I had injera bread and it was weird. I did not like the mushy/sponge like texture or the fact that it is served cold. I'm too used to roti and naan I guess. It did not have much flavour, I would compare it to a pancake like much others on here.I also found the prices to be expensive considering how much food you get and the quality of food. Everything is very bland. I was expecting food rich in aroma and spices.

We also ordered coffee, which takes about an hour to be prepared. I did enjoy the ceremony part and the incense. The coffee is very strong and served in little cups. It was good but not worth the hour long wait. 

All in all, I would not recommend this place and would not go back and try it again."}
{"text":"This is consistently my favourite Ethiopian restaurant. Friendly,reasonable delicious."}
{"text":"We had visitors from outta town who wanted to see the various ethnic communities Toronto has to offer, as well as try some ethnic foods.  I had not yet tried Ethiopian food and was pleased when Ethiopian House Restaurant was willing to take a reservation for our group on a Saturday night.  (I was turned down by several other restaurants.)

We had no idea what we were doing, so we asked the waitress for suggestions and she just brought us a bit of everything!  The appetizers were not well-received by our group.  Firstly, they are served cold, which was kind of different.  I really enjoyed the chickpea dish and the injera dish was also interesting.  Very different in flavour, and kind of refreshing with it being cold.

Our main dishes came on gigantic platters.  We were able to try some of the vegetarian options, the chicken and the beef.  Being our first experience with Ethiopian food, we all appreciated the opportunity to try a little bit of everything.  Lots of interesting flavours and textures and the injera (bread) fills you up quickly.  The large platters were excellent for sharing in a group.  I'm not sure what or how I would order if I dined alone, as I liked everything offered.

Service was a little off.  It was very difficult to get our waitress' attention, and when we did it was very difficult to communicate what we wanted.  She was friendly enough most of the time, but I thought it was kind of rude when she asked if she could take our coffee cups away because she needed them for another table.  

There's an entire page in the menu dedicated to the Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony.  Perhaps I expected more than a simple pouring of coffee into shot-glass sized cups.  Or perhaps I failed to recognize that burning incense and serving popcorn made up the ceremony.  The popcorn was slightly.. I wish more was explained to us (rather than us coming up with our own stories) but it was a cool experience.

Interesting décor - lots of cool photos on their walls.  The walls are painted in bright (semi-tacky) colours.  Only 2 washrooms (1 for men and 1 for women) here and it's awkward to stand around the area to wait your turn.  There has to be a better way.

They also need to improve their payment system.  I had to go downstairs to pay with my credit card, where used my chip card and entered my PIN but still had to sign a visa slip too?  There were a few people ahead of me in the payment line and, again, it was awkward waiting there, around the front door.  There has to be a better way.

I'm glad I finally tried Ethiopian food, but I won't be hurrying back."}
{"text":"We tried both the veg and meat sampler and really enjoyed it. Nice atmosphere and small patio. It was interesting eating with our hands rather than with cutlery. Only some items are spicy, so there are flavours for everyone."}
{"text":"I liked this place! it was my first time trying Ethiopian food and I was impressed.

it's a cosy little place that's got seating up top and down on the main level.

the staff are very friendly and explain whatever it is you don't know.

as an Indo-Canadian, the food here reminded me of traditional Indian dishes - which is probably what made me enjoy the place more. We ordered a very platter with various types of \"curried\" veggies - we didn't like the kale but the rest was delicious. 

definitely will try Ethiopian cuisine again."}
{"text":"Ethiopia House Refused To Give Me Forks or Spoons...and I loved it.  What good food here and you get to eat with your hands.  Ethiopian food is diverse, extremely satisfying and good for you.  Food is usually served family style with one large dish shared amongst the group.

Food is served with Injera, which is a large sourdough flatbread.  It is like a spongy roti with little to no flavour.  It is however a perfect vessel for scooping up food and its sauces.  The spongy pockets of goodness that suck up all the flavours of the sauces?  See them?  They are awesome.

I enjoyed two Ethiopian beers that were surprisingly good.  The stout was not really a stout I think but more of a Dark Ale and I loved it.  It is called Hakim Stout but I will have to ask Hakim what it really is if I am ever in Ethiopia.

The perfect meal.  Ok so we have bevy of delights here.  On your left is yellow chickpeas and red lentils in 2 different sauces.  They reminded me of eating Dhal with roti.  On the bottom is Tikil Gomon (carrot and Cabbage), Atakelt Wot (String Beans and Potatoes) and collard greens.  The vegetables were perfectly cooked and spiced right.  Middle right is Kifto Beef ceviche and top right is Kibs (marinated beef done medium).  The Kifto was like a fine grind ground beef but packed with flavours of tomato and chilie.  The Tibs were tender and might as well of been stewed it had so much flavour.  

They also add a simple salad in the middle and cottage cheese.  You take the injera, pick up the meat, then the cottage cheese, dip it in the pepper spice mix and enjoy.  The cottage cheese was similar to unsalted feta and very dry. 
 
The interior of the restaurant has a strong incense smell and a colorful decor.  We ate on the patio cause it was shaded and beautiful outside.

After we finished our meal the group beside us also finished their meal and the server brought out a pan called a that had been roasting beans for Ethiopian coffee.  She waved the smoking pot around the table for all to smell.  This is a tradition to allow the patrons to sample the coffee scent and the coffee ceremony is worth it.  The smell was intoxicating and I had to try it.  It was $13 for 1 to 6 people and takes at least 30 minutes to make, so order it before your meal.  I asked the group beside us if we could join their coffee order and share the cost.  Of course they agreed, we are in Toronto.

So, on the spot roasted coffee served in a Jebna or clay pot.  Really cool stuff and so aromatic.  Coffee is served with snacks and in this case popcorn.  I think the snacks are to support the conversation while you enjoy your coffee.  There is also incense burnt while you drink.

Coffee is served plain, with sugar or clarified butter.  I tried all 3 and prefer it plain.  The butter I just don't get and the sugar actually made the coffee bitter.  The coffee was very strong, aromatic,"}
{"text":"I come here at least a couple of times a year, and have done so over the past four or five years. Never have I had a bad experience :)
Injera is always fresh, and food is consistently well-seasoned and fresh. Hot foods hot, and salad freshly-tossed and crispy.
I brought family from Spain here to eat Ethiopian and they did not know (first) what it was and (second) that they would love it so much.
I recommend coming during the winter for a filling meal and/or trying to score an outdoor table on the front patio during the summer/fall. If sharing (best option), I find it ideal to order half vegetarian and half meat, in order to taste more dishes.
While I don't ever come here during a lunch hour from work or when I'm in a rush, I wonder if the individual dishes would arrive faster. I always come with a companion to sit an linger a bit - the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"i had my first ethiopian food experience in toronto at Ethiopian House Restaurant. so while i can't compare it to similar restaurants here, i do think that it is comparable to times that i've eaten ethiopian food elsewhere. that is, the Ethiopian House Restaurant is average and good on levels of taste, atmosphere, service, and price.

here goes my attempt to report as subjectively as possible:
the flavour of the injera was characteristically tangy due to (from what i've read) a process of fermenting the large flat bread shaped, pancake/un-toasted crumpet textured eating \"utensil\". i shared a vegetarian combo (?) and the flavours of approximately 7-9 \"toppings\" were not outstanding, but not unlike other places i've been either. the lentils were lentils but stewed, spinach was spinach but stewed, yada yada, and so forth. 
the cozy, dim atmosphere was \"ethnic\"-kitschy. some others' photos depict the interior well. there's a petit patio that's especially nice because of the restaurant's location on a quieter side street near the busy bustle of yonge street.
service was homey, also typical.
prices are reasonable too. dinner for two (that we couldn't finish) was about $30, but we didn't order drinks. although, like many other restaurants serving ethiopian food, they too serve honey wine and a long-brewed ethiopian coffee.

i consider ethiopian cuisine the safe \"exotic\" food - many apparently unidentifiable foods and a different manner of handling food at the table, yet made with familiar ingredients and comfortable textures and tastes. my three-star rating reflects average-ness and that's not necessarily bad. the Ethiopian House is good."}
{"text":"Great place...nice atmosphere...terrific...very unique food."}
{"text":"My friend Renee brought me here on a Friday night. We had to wait a little bit for a table as they seemed understaffed, but the food was well worth the wait. We both had the vegetarian combo platter and it was some of the best Ethiopian food I've had."}
{"text":"We had heard many great things about Ethiopian and I was excited to try some new flavours.

I reserved seating for our group of 6 at the Ethiopian House. For our table, we shared 2 platters of the Bayaaynatu, ($13) - one vegetarian, one meat. The meat had pan-fried beef and steak with a pepper topping. We used our hands to dip the Injera (spongy-bread) into the curries/sauces. A really fun experience for all of us first-timers.

Unfortunately, the flavours were not overly impressive. I thought they would be more powerful. Service was quite slow, as well. Several times we had to ask for water refills, extra napkins, and for our bill.

Overall, I had much higher expectations for my first time Ethiopian meal but would be willing to try again."}
{"text":"When someone describes the premise behind Ethiopian food, I'll admit it's a tough sell. Cold squishy flat bread you use to scoop up lentils - but I gotta tell you, it's amazing. 

I was there for my second time last week and was yet again impressed with the great food, fragrant aromas and rich atmosphere. The food is packed with unique flavours and from minute you walk in you really feel like your experiencing something totally different, but never in a forced or touristy way. 

The two standouts on the menu for me are the Tibs (beef cooked in chillies and spices) and the coffee - If you're a fan of dark roast, you absolutely must try theirs. You'll need to order it at the start of your meal as it takes about 30 minutes for them to roast the beans (can you say fresh?). 

It's a small place, with an extremely laid-back atmosphere, so if you're in a rush or expecting a waiter to dote on you, chances are you'll be disappointed. On the other hand, if you're looking for a full dining experience and want to soak it all up, this is your place."}
{"text":"We adore Ethiopia House. Cozy and lively. Can it be both? So much care put into the preparation of the meals to the lovely, smiling faces of the caretakers make this our favourite. 
You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"While I do have a special place for Ethiopian House in my heart because it's was where I had my first date with the woman I now call a wife, as it goes for Ethiopian food, the place is pretty standard. It's good but doesn't stand out as super special.

Like many Ethiopian restaurants, the service is very slow. As I've been told, this is a cultural thing so I won't complain too much and besides, it gives you time to chat with your dining partner(s). The food is solid but as you can read from some of my other reviews, there are better Ethiopian places in Toronto. 

In fact, the true Ethiopian Gem, and top of my list is on the Danforth in the east end. 

Anyhow, if you're in the area and Ethiopian is what you want, you'll do just fine coming here. I wouldn't hesitate to return if I was in the area. That being said, I live closer to Ethiopian House than most other Ethiopian restaurants and my wife and I will still choose to walk the 4-5km to our top choice than to go here instead. If that says anything. ;)"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Ethiopian food and since this restaurant had a bunch of reviews, I came here for a Wednesday night dinner with my friend. The restaurant itself is easy to find and is located close to the Downtown core. The restaurant is very small so if you're coming with a group, make sure you make reservations! I'd say it seats approximately 20 people, so we had to wait around five minutes.

We didn't even look at the menu, we just asked the server what they recommend. Ten minutes later, she comes out with a huge plate of mixed meat and veggie items on a gigantic injera. On the side, it was also served with rolls of injera. I absolutely loved the different sauces. There was one that I felt was tomato based and another that was yellow, which was my personal favourite! 

I will definitely come here again! It was around 18$ per person including tax and tip for this big platter. Make sure you come with your friends, because it's a really unique experience since you get to eat the food with your hands"}
{"text":"Ever since the only Ethiopian spot closed down in my hometown of Halifax a long time ago, I've been itching to get back to eating Ethiopian food during my trip to Toronto.

This place is cozy and the decor is lovely. Seating is a bit tight on the first floor but I understand they have a floor upstairs too which may be a bit more roomy. My party and I decided to let our waitress pick her recommended dishes and we got a mix of meat and veggie dishes to share. What great flavours! Everything was very tasty and even though the portions looked small at first, we quickly realized how filling everything is. The food was so good we couldn't even stop when we were completely stuffed. 

The prices seem reasonable too."}
{"text":"Interior walls are warmly painted and covered with African art- I really enjoyed the art, sculpture, and three dimension art framing on the walls. I ordered the veggie plate and I really like eating the split pea dish that came with it. We waited for around 10 minutes for a table to open up because the restaurant was that popular. Upstairs hosts more tables and a bar."}
{"text":"Got the meat and vegetable lunch special. Although the meat and vegetable portions seemed small, the Ethiopian bread (injera) will fill you up. The bread had a spongey texture. The meat was on the spicier side. Make sure you wash your hands because the food is served without any cutlery!

Beware that service may be on the slow side as there was only one server during lunch time!"}
{"text":"How have I never reviewed this place?!

I've been coming here for years and I love it. 

One thing you need to know, it takes a long time to get your food, but when you do get it, it's fantastic. It's much nicer and a bit pricier than the places on Bloor and Ossington, which might make it easier to introduce friends to Ethiopian food. I always get a mixed veggie platter and a meat, so I don't actually know what anything that I eat is called. I've never been disappointed.

They have a separate dining room upstairs where I've seen them hold parties before."}
{"text":"Man, I have such a love/hate relationship with this place. I am not going to discuss the food because honestly it all tastes good and other yelpers have gone into far more detail. 

First and foremost, let me share that I like Ethiopian food. I think it's tasty and I like the idea of the communal sharing of the food as I find it quite natural. Definitely not the type of cuisine for germophobes, that's for sure. But delicious nevertheless.

Now, I think this is a great starter place for those who have never tried Ethiopian food but for better food just Google \"Ethiopian restaurant Bloor West,\" and you will find some great little places around Ossington or Lansdowne like Lalibela or Nazareth.   

So what is wrong with this place? If their food is not bad, then what is it? It's their bloody service. They are horrible. I don't want to sound like I am generalizing, but I will. The women at this place provide horrible service. They are inattentive, nonchalant, for most of them is NOT a language barrier so I have come to think that for all intensive purposes, they just hate their jobs. Seriously I have been going there for 8 years on and off (you can't beat the location as it was 6 minutes away from my place on foot, damn it!) and their bad service is completely consistent. They ARE bad. 

Having said that, if you still want to go to this place, then I suggest you do what I do, only go during the summer months, as for some reason the patios are generally served mostly by the men. Who in huge contrast are chatty, friendly and far more laid-back. Trust me, I have been here long enough to discard any notion that it was just an isolated experience. And I have gone there sporadically enough that it is not because of *me,* personally. It's like the more you go there, the worse they treat you. Instead of the other way around. Ha!

By the way, their coffee, or for that matter the Ethiopian coffee is delicious and worth the $12ish, just remember to order it at the beginning of the meal as it takes about 30min. to make. Also make sure you get some unsalted popcorn with it, because they might forget. Is that part of the ceremony? Actually, it is.    

The decor is not bad, with a very Ethiopian, low-key vibe and their 1/2 litters of wine are cheap, really cheap. Which makes it an okay place to hang out just at the patio if it is too hot to eat during the summer. 

So this is not a bad place, however it is sadly brought down by their really, really bad service. Which to me was a mixed blessing, as I discovered a bunch of marginally better choices food-wise and worlds-better service-wise on Bloor West."}
{"text":"I chose this place based on good reviews. The owner was very friendly and food arrived promptly. We ordered for the Vegetarian Platter which has a mix of everything. The injera (bread) was done well and similar to what I had eaten before at Nazareth. There were about 7-8 varieties and all tasted well.

I may not go there again soon for lack of options, but definately my go-to place when I want Ethiopian food again."}
{"text":"Ethiopian House was my first Ethiopian restaurant, and I keep coming back because it is my favourite. I work only 10 minutes away so I can often be seen here, usually reading a book.

I am a buffet, little-bit-of-everything kind of person, so I always get the Vegetarian Bayaaynatu, which includes 8 dishes. They are very consistent and always delicious. The injara bread is mildly sour and a perfect complement.

I have never experienced the poor service that some other Yelpers have described. The servers I encounter are always friendly and chatty, and my food arrives in a timely manner (that is to say, around 10-15 minutes after ordering. I will never understand why so many Torontonians believe food should be served 5 minutes after ordering!)

The decor is unique and includes a ceiling decorated with what I'm pretty sure is a variety of furs. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Loved it! 
Food was tasty, but a bit pricey. Favourite Ethiopian yet.
The coffee service truly was the crowning glory, its sublime. I am not a coffee drinker (almost ever, I've drank one cup of coffee my whole life) but this was the supreme coffee experience. That alone draws me back. 
Service was alright."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Ethiopian food, but this was as good as any other place I'd had it at. I was there as part of a special event, so we kind of just told the chef to make us something good and they brought out these big platters with the injera (bread) and a bunch of different stuff arranged around the edge. As a result, I am not entirely sure of the identity of everything that I put in my mouth, but here is what I am pretty sure I ate:

-House salad
-Gored-gored? (some type of beef chunks)
-Tikil Goman (potatoes, cabbage, carrots)
-Goman Wot (collards)
-Sherro Wot (chickpeas)
-several other things that were probably peas or lentils

Most of the stuff was vegetarian because we had some vegetarians in our party; could be different if everyone was more carnivorous. We also had this lager called Tusker that's made in Ethiopia; it's pretty good in my opinion.

The service can be slow; I think that just comes with the restaurant, but it wasn't as if we felt that we were being actively ignored. I just wouldn't come here if I had to dine and dash. This place is great for vegetarians; I'm more meat-inclined myself, but all the veggie dishes were quite flavorful and filling. Downstairs seating is best for parties of 1-4, while upstairs can probably accommodate up to an entire party of 40-50 (if you reserve ahead)."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying any Ethiopian food so I have nothing to compare to, but it was definitely a great first experience! 

Went here on a Thursday night and they only had the first floor open and one waitress. This was fine at first but it actually got quite busy afterwards. 

As I've never tried any Ethiopian dishes before, I was completely lost with the menu and asked the waitress for some suggestions. Right away she recommended he house special, which to this day I'm don't know what it contained, but she assured us we would love it. The house special as I understand is a kind of like a sampler plate in which they adjust portion size depending on the amount of servings. 

The house special is served with a sort of pancake like bread, which I believe is called injera. It's sooo soft and surprisingly sour which actually goes well with a lot of the dishes served. 
When our main platter arrived it was HUGE! So much variety, and each item was very full of flavour. In the middle there was a chicken stew which was covered in a hot chilli oil, which actually closely resembles the type of hot chilli oil you get from northern Chinese restaurants. 
Eating with my hands was a bit difficult at first and definitely messy but please don't let that deter you from trying this delicious food!

Overall, this first experience blew me away. I was very happy with the recommendation given and the food was very good and flavourful. Almost forgot to mention very good value as well!"}
{"text":"Was here on a first date and was glad we came to this restaurant. First time eating Ethiopian food but we had the veggie platter and it was delicious. Went again and tried the meat platter but actually preferred the veggie platter despite usually being a meat eater. Portion was fantastic, enough for two if neither of you are starving. Service was excellent. Intimate setting. Would definitely come here again. Recommended."}
{"text":"At normal menu prices ($14 for one serving or $25.25 for two of the Vegetarian Bayaaynatu platter, which is pretty much all I ever get), Ethiopian House isn't particularly enticing. The service has NEVER earned any points from me, and the food doesn't warrant being double the cost of, say, Nazareth.

But during lunch hours ($8 for the veggie platter for one), it gets about 3 stars. It's filling, fun especially for first-timers, and a nice change of pace if your dietary plan doesn't usually consist of a cold spongy injera blanket with stuff on it. Honestly, I prefer the eating experience over the taste, but the green beans, potatoes and collard greens are my favourite.

As for the century-long coffee ceremony: thick, aromatic shots with a side of burnt popcorn and incense. Maybe worth a try if you're in a group and planning on enjoying some post-dinner dialogue, but if you're just popping by for lunch as I'm advising, plan on grabbing a Double Double instead."}
{"text":"What is it about Ethiopian food that takes so damn long?  We waited an ungodly amount of time for our food, then another eternity waiting for the coffee presentation at the end.

I'm happy to report that if you have the time, the food is spectacular and worth the wait.  

The Injera was very tasty and not bitter at all.  I have no idea what all that other crap (you can't help but make the comparison) is, but it's damn good as well.

I'd give this place 3 stars for slow service and the weird incense but most of the other decent Ethiopian places I've patronized were also really slow.  

I've never gone out of my way for Ethiopian, but if I somehow get the urge again this place will definitely be on my list."}
{"text":"Yelp continues to both challenge and tantalize my taste buds.  Ethiopian cuisine was uncharted territory for me, but I am always up for an adventure!  Even though some firsts are forgettable, it never stops me... You gotta try everything once right?  Okay, maybe not everything.

My only preconception of Ethiopian food is that it is random piles of \"mush,\" you eat with your hands and you must try Ethiopian coffee.  Nothing exciting like \"its pan-seared and then served with a balsamic jus\" lol.  So I was going in totally blind and relying on pure fate.  That and I was pretty hungry, so anything would've been satisfying. 

Whenever I dine out, I usually take it upon myself to take responsibility in ordering.  But tonight, my fate would rest in someone else's trusty hands of fellow Elite Karl R.  And I am happy to say that I was NOT disappointed.

We ordered the Vegetarian Bayaaynatu which came with 8 different veggie components and is served with Injera.  Injera has a crêpe-like consistency, but tastes like sourdough bread.  Due to its flimsy texture, it makes scooping up the various sauces/stews difficult.  And for a klutz like me, I'm sure it made for a very entertaining show.  

Misir Wot (Lentil Stew in berbere sauce)

Sherro Wot (Highly-seasoned chick peas (powder) in berbere sauce)

Tikil Goman (Cabbage, carrots, potatoes, cooked in turmeric sauce)

Goman Wot (Kale or collard greens in mild sauce)

Yekik Alicha (Yellow split peas in mild turmeric sauce)

Kik Wot (Split peas stew in berbere sauce)

Misir Alicha (Split lentil stew in thick mild sauce with seasoning)

Atakelt Wot (Mixed vegetables - string beans, carrots, potatoes - cooked in tomato sauce)

Every component of the platter was well-seasoned, rich in flavour, and fragrant in spices.  I do not mean that it was spicy, because I did not find any of it to be spicy (e.g. hot).  It was surprisingly filling.

I would probably not recommend coming here on a date (at least not a first date if you're still trying to convince or in my case, fool the other party into thinking you are a classy lady, lol).  This is a \"get down and dirty\" dining experience as you will get food all over your hands.  But luckily there are wet naps at your disposal.

I did not like our server as when we had reminded her we asked for a second helping of Injera she gave us a dirty look, and that was just not cool.  I should be shooting HER the dirty look... she made us ask twice for something.  If I were footing the bill I definitely would not have given her a generous tip.

Unfortunately, because we had had coffee at a nearby Starbucks prior to, I had to pass on ordering coffee.  After all, it was a work night, and already closing in on 9PM, and I do need my rest!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a lunch with your co-workers. They have the veggie platter for those that are vegetarians or if you want something less protein-heavy for lunch. Great portion-size. I had to take my veggie platter to go. Their injera bread is to die for and it's unlimited! :D 

Their traditional coffee is pretty bitter but quite authentic. It's served with in unbuttered popcorn, not sure about the cultural reference there. Actual coffee takes about at least 20minutes to prepare. I'd suggest you call-in ahead of time for this order if you are running on time. 

Service is kinda slow as they only had one waitress running the entire 2-floor restaurant +patio. If you want bang for your buck and don't really mind too much about the service, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Ethiopian House serves authentic Ethiopian cuisine. The service is very friendly. The atmosphere of the restaurant is reflective of the Ethiopian culture. 

The food is quite flavourful and reasonably priced. We got a platter of veggies, lentils and beef.  Each item on the platter has its own unique flavour.  The platter is accompany with injera (Ethiopian spongy bread). You use the injera to pick up the food. You eat with your hands as cutlery is not available (make sure you wash your hands).

I would recommend this place if you are craving Ethiopian food. It's definitely worth a try. It's not my favourite cuisine, but there are some interesting flavours and textures."}
{"text":"I have never tried Ethiopian food and was very excited about the event. I wanted to wait a full 24hrs before reviewing so that all foods could be consumed and digested before I wrote my review.

LOVES:
Decor - I found myself craning my neck to look at the various photos around the restaurant. Plus, all the different old lighted signs behind the bar, including a sign of the Toronto skyline that blinked every so often.
Food - I enjoyed it. Susan had asked the server to bring us a mixture of meat and veggie dishes and she did not disappoint. The Tikil Goman was one of my favs. I also loved the Beef Tibs and the House salad.
Our Server - Sometimes, when going to culturally rich restaurants, you get the owner's daughter or nephew who doesn't know much about what's being served or how to explain it and you feel slightly cheated. But, at Ethiopian House, our server was extremely knowledgeable. She gave us great recommendations for food and when serving the coffee, she let us know that drinking it with clarified butter was great for cold sufferers.
Price - We ate and were merry for about $15-20 each. Not most restaurants can boast cheap and good food.
Company - Sharing food with Yelpers instantly ups a rating! It just made for a great night.

DISLOVES:
Injera - It could be because I'm slightly partial to my roti when it comes to food being picked up by a bread-like substance. But I couldn't jump on the injera bandwagon. It's spongy consistency reminds me of a pancake. Having to eat it with everything made me slowly stop eating because I couldn't take the taste and consistency anymore. Susan's advice of using the injera to pick up food and then just eating the food off of it will probably be used by me next time I go.

Honourable mentions: 
Kat F. for organizing
All the other diners who were silent when our server explained the coffee and when Susan C. was talking (* If you didn't know that Susan C. has it like that, now you know!)"}
{"text":"What else can I say that hasen't been said? I can't say I ever  though of Ethiopian cuisine when I thought about where to eat. A friend took me to this place over lunch and I was impressed. The Injera becomes a bit much and fills you up fast, the spongy texture also turned me away a little, so while I certainly enjoyed the food, I don't think I could eat it too often. 

The price seemed right for a quick lunch and I would likely return from time to time when I've run out of my usual lunch spots."}
{"text":"We've always wanted to try out Ethiopian food, so we came here on a late Tuesday night after work. 

The size of the restaurant is quite small. If you have a group of more than 4 people, you may need reservations so that they can set it up. The whole restaurant probably seats about 20 people at most. The atmosphere was really cozy, homey, and comfortable. The decor is traditional showing some of the culture. The hostess who greeted us was wearing a traditional dress which was quite refreshing to see. 

There is a relatively strong aroma throughout the restaurant, it's kind of smokey..like flavoured tobacco of some sort, so if you're sensitive to that, that's something you may want to think about before coming here. 

We ordered the veggie and meat platter to share between the two of us. The food was really delicious. Since it was our first time trying Ethiopian food, a lot of the flavours were very new to us, but nonetheless they were very tasty. Portion size was perfect for sharing, we even took some home. I think it's because there was a lot of injera that was given, but could've used more meat and veggie on top. Prices are okay if you share the meals. Not too many options though. 

Service took longer than expected and there's certain dishes where they tell you how long it will take to make, so if you're in a hurry, this may not be your spot. The staff were friendly and welcoming. 

Overall I would come back to try more of their menu items, really enjoyed our time here. Good for a date!"}
{"text":"Ethiopian house was quite an experience. I didn't know what to expect when my friend suggested we try it for lunch. I'm always up for trying new types of food so I couldn't say no but I did have some reservations. 

The restaurant is quite small, only enough space for a few tables. It's cozy and a bit squishy. The service was a tad slow as well when I arrived. It was mostly full and as I recall, passing by on occasion, this was common.

The food was unique. My party ordered a platter of I-don't-know or remember. Basically a very large crepe the size of an X-large pizza. On top they place the condiments of your choice: beef tartar, sautéed greens, pickled veg, and other meat mixtures. We ate with our hands of course. 

I thought the food was prepared well but just not to my taste or preference. I don't like moist or wet crepes. I'm uncomfortable grabbing my food that way with my hands. The flavours were good but I found others to be unusual.

Overall if you like different and new foods this is the place for you. I'm just unaccustomed to eating moist or wet food with my hands."}
{"text":"Ethiopian House is always a delicious and enjoyable experience. Awesome for both vegetarians and meat lovers. The prices are very reasonable and the food is always on point. True to some comments I have seen on Yelp - the service is not the fastest - however, for a small, independent, family owned, local restaurant (that is also very cheap) I feel that some patrons have to temper their expectations. I wouldn't come here if I was in a rush, but if I want really good, hearty food that is filling, fresh and packed full of flavour - Ethiopian House is a go-to spot."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Ethiopian food.  It was quite the experience. For those who haven't been there before, you are served a platter of curries and veggies, then you eat them using this rubbery type of bread as utensils.

It sounds weird, but if you are looking for something new, I definitely recommend it.

3 stars because the service was kind of slow (we did show up with 15 people, but the place wasn't packed)."}
{"text":"TINY SERVING SIZE ... AND WOW, THIS WAITRESS NEEDS TO BE FIRED!!! Our young waitress on the Saturday night that we went was simply the worst server we have ever experienced!

1) She asked us to move the tables and chairs for ourselves.
2) She insisted we order quickly as she was busy.
3) We just wanted 1 spoon for the table as we were running out of bread to pick up the meat/veggies and she replied \"If I give you one, I would need to give every table one\". Yes, that actually happened!
4) We ordered the coffee ceremony but she refused to do it. Of course, she still charged it on the bill initially. 

The whole evening, she treated all the customers around us as if she is overwhelmed and doesn't want to be bothered. We were not the only table that was upset.

As for the food, it was tasty enough though the serving size is on the small side.  Eg, the Doro Wat literally had one chicken drumstick and one hard boiled egg.  The rest of that dish was just gravy. 

We usually go to Lucy Ethiopian Kitchen on the Danforth and the serving size is about 1.5 time larger there. A piece of beef here is the size of your finger nail whereas at Lucy, it's the size of your pinky. The service at Lucy is also tremendous and friendly.

The restaurant is very tiny so the tables are very close together and it can get noisy.

I will NEVER go to Ethiopian House again."}
{"text":"I'm actually having some difficulty WRAPPING my head around what to rate this place.  Wrapping my Vege Mash and Meat with Injera was a bit easier but I think both Eric L and I were a little hesitant to just dig in since we're both Ethiopian food rookies.

The meal and coffee took as long as a TRIP to Ethiopia itself and I've never even been anywhere close before but can't be any less than an hour.  The food platter individual items itself is what I don't understand because it seems to be that they taste like they were right off a warming-tray of some sort but maybe there is an Ethiopian preparation method I'm idiotic about.

I have to self admit that I'm open to eat anything edible out there.  I'm pretty glad of that so that I can have this experience where I'm literally without a knife & fork in a classy Ethiopian themed restaurant.  The lighting was a fitting for the INCENSE provided to give some stress relaxation.  The incense might be a bit strong for some or they might even think that's the coffee smell.   :)

I was unaware of the Ethiopian photos on the wall of Ethiopian ladies showing their NAKED breast which is a tradtional dress fashion as a guess.  Now I know Danielle P. has a good eye for these things, I wonder if Chris P. knows though?!?

{"text":"3.5 Stars for me.  I ate here years ago once for lunch, and it really turned me off of Ethiopian food.  I swore off of it.  Maybe it was the injera, the soggy sponge.

The CMYE event tonight, originally scheduled for Okonomi House, brought us to Ethiopian House by accident.  And I've had a change of heart.  I can't say too many bad things about the food anymore, even the injera was manageable.  That being said, I had consumed about 86 calories the prior 24 hours, so that is another consideration of why I now find this place so desirable.

I'm definitely going back here, but will pass on the coffee -- I can't wait two hours for a shot of espresso, thanks."}
{"text":"Very nice Ethiopian dinner there tonight with a bunch of Yelpers.  (Thanks Kat for arranging).  

The meal was very enjoyable.  The wait between ordering and food arrival, just about right (and pretty much what I expect for good Ethiopian food).  The food, unlike some other Ethiopian places, was not drowning in liquid, but just moist enough to be flavourful.

We had a minor ordering glitch that had 2 people waiting longer than acceptable, but I think it was as much our ordering glitch as theirs. (maybe more us, than them). ;)"}
{"text":"the shop is cute, and well decorated. I like that its different than your typical restaurant.

but oh the food... I can't say that I like it.

in many ways, the cuisine reminds me of indian food. the colorful blend of beans and veggie but.. unlike indian cuisine, this really lacks flavor. Everything was a few levels too bland and I was not impressed about that.

and about the injera... it was ICE cold. I literally was shocked to find out that it's so freezing cold when I touched it. What place serves their bread/carb dish cold? I'm not used to it i guess, and it was an interesting surprise. the flavor of the injera is also probably an acquired taste. a bit sour, a bit salty, and... something else. 

In general, did not enjoy my dinner here. not my thing."}
{"text":"If you've never had Ethiopian food before, its definitely worth trying. And Ethiopian House is a great place to do it.

The place is a converted house locate on Irwin just south of Bloor of Yonge. The decor is very authentic - lots of nic naks and wall hangings. We sat upstairs next to big windows over looking the street. Our waitress was very nice and recommend that we order two huge plates of veggie and meat dishes. The cool thing about Ethiopian food is that they're no utensils - you eat your food by picking it up with this very tasty soft doughy bread-like thing. You make little packages with your food and pop it in your mouth - it's very tasty and requires little clean up. 

The food itself was really good, if not a big too spicy. The meat dish was delicious, tender and juicy and the sauce was very tasty. The veggie dishes were hard to decipher because most of them were all mashed up but they were also very delicious. It was unlike any other food I'd ever tasted (although in some ways, similar to to Indian curry) but I would definitely recommend trying it. 

If you aren't sure what to get, just ask your server. They were very knowledgeable and our food was really tasty."}
{"text":"My first visit to Ethiopian House was a decade ago (I have no way of knowing if it is still the same people running it, but my guess is yes). We enjoyed our food and drink very much, but I thought the meat entrees could be a bit spicier. When we returned this time - same group of people - I was wondering if the first time had been a fluke. To my satisfaction, it was. The meats on our platter were nicely spiced and very fresh tasting. I would still like to see even stronger flavor in the vegetable and legume portions, but otherwise everything was delicious. Very little has changed here, and I consider that to be a very good thing... why change something that is working? My favorite part of the decor is the portraits of all the people. The menu is relatively simple yet all-encompassing. There are a lot of beverage options including delicious Ethiopian coffee. We always order a variety of combination platters to get a bit of everything. My favorites this time were the tibs and the collards. In nice weather, you can also dine outside, where you can sometimes get whiffs of the aromas from the kitchen. Dining at Ethiopian House is something to which I always look forward on my visits to Toronto."}
{"text":"Just ate here not long ago.

First time eating Ethiopian food. I figured I give it a try given the great reviews.

Extremely nice and gracious host. Place seemed friendly and warm.

Ordered the vegetarian platter with 8 dishes and a side of beef stew. Beef stew good and hearty. Vegetarian platter was barely warm. The injera bread is basically a grey pancake.  So you take it and you use it to scoop up the food.

It was okay. I wasn't blown away with the flavors. I equated it to me using a pancake scooping mush, which I guess is indeed a very Ethiopian thing to do.

If you've never tried Ethiopian, sure give it a shot. Maybe you will fall in love with this cuisine and be one of those die hard fans depicted in these reviews. As for me, I am closing the books on this cuisine."}
{"text":"I have no idea what any of it is called even after two visits, but it's chicken and veggies and so delicious. The coffee service is to die for as well. Service is quiet and nice. The upstairs room is perfect for parties.

I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"I went back today and there's a lovely patio out front! As everyone says, the guy who serves you and runs the place is an absolute sweetheart. I went with a friend today who had never had Ethiopian, we split the veggie lunch and the meat lunch specials and it was $20 combined! Amazing deal and my friend loved it."}
{"text":"Ok so for those of you not used to Ethiopian restaurants, let's set the bar right - service is NOT as attentive or fast as many other places.  If I was comparing against other restaurants, this place would have gotten a 3 for service.  However, it's very much in-line with other Ethiopian restaurants I've been to..

The decor is not 5-star, as with most Ethiopian places, but it's clean and inviting.  They burn incense which I could do without, but I suppose it's probably better than the lingering scent of the various spices they regularly cook with.

Came in for lunch right as they opened at 12:00pm and got the specials - a veggie platter and a meat platter, which they combined into a large combined platter for us.  The food came quite quickly - I'd say around 15 minutes after ordering, which is fast for these places.  Had to ask the server for more injara and water refills, but aside from that the food was amazing (as always), and I got just what I came for.  It's my 2nd visit here and there will definitely be more!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Service was kind of slow but very nice people. Had the ethiopian beer and it was okay.
Eating food with your hands was never better than in this place. Would go again the next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with some co-workers for lunch.  I've passed by this place numerous of times since my university days.  Finally upon arrival the ambiance is beautifully decorated with Ethiopian influence.  Their menu features a lot of choices along with daily lunch specials that 
provide you plenty of selections. 

For starters our entourage of 3 decided to try their stuffed veggie spicy green peppers.  Nothing over the top but nonetheless it was flavorful and spicy.

For main entree I opted to try their daily lunch special- meat platter dish which featured a colorful melody/sample of meats prepared.  Each sample was specially prepared with its own distinctive spice exhibiting the flavors of Ethiopia.  Each portion had its own distinctive taste but overall average in my books. 

Overall the place is great, the service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"3.4/5
Food was quiet westernized but it worked better for me. Its shame but I'm not good with sour injura. Me and my company had timatin fit-fit; sautéed injura pieces with tomatoes and other veggies with refreshing lemonie dressing. It taste like fresh salsa mixed with brushetta. Our main dish were gored-gored and bayaaynatu. I can't recall which was what since they put all our orders together on one plate. We got two chopped steak; one is simple steak and the other one is red sauced steak, and pan fried beef with vegetables. I think my favorite one was red sauced steak(I'm guessing it's kitfo special). It was flavourful but still easy for me to enjoy. Other meats were good but im not good with sour food and other meats are either bland or too sour for me to fully enjoy. 

Service was A-OK. I had to approach three times to get napkins and water. But she was very nice when we asked for a bill. 

Overall, food was not that special and service was met, but I will still revisit if I'm in neighbor and want something different."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment! Saw the great reviews and wanted to try something new so came by for a dinner on a weekday night. It was very empty, my dining companion and I were the only two in the restaurant. I was pretty surprised since it was around dinner time. That was probably the first sign that I should've have turned around and go somewhere else.

We ordered the veggie and meat platter for two people. The dishes were very much average, nothing stellar. There were a variety of meat, veggie and bean based dips. 

The injera (what you use to scoop the meat/veggie/beans what have you) tasted very sour. Not sure if that's the way it is or if it's gone bad. Regardless, it wasn't for me.

The service was horrid. I had to get out of my seat and find the waitress in their little nooks to get any type of service. I'm sorry but I when I go to a sit down restaurant I don't expect to have to get out of my seat to be served. Is that too much to ask? When I wanted to pay, the waitress punched in some numbers on the register and told me how much I owed  without even presenting a bill (also had to walk up to the register to pay btw). Yep. Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian food and it was incredible!! The service here was meh as far as friendliness goes but the food came out quickly and I was stuffed by the end of my meal! Will definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"I used to go here weekly in the 1990s and loved it. I just ordered for home delivery yesterday and was disappointed to have my order cancelled since they have NO gluten free options, which also makes the food inauthentic as teff is supposed to be used for the injera, not a teff/wheat blend (which cheapens the item). I'm very disappointed, especially since this is the only Ethiopian food that delivers to my area!

Please go back to authentic Ethiopian!"}
{"text":"Good food but not the best ethiopian I've had. Try the special where you get the bread and a few meats/veggies. The owner is pretty cool though, totally laid back :-) talk to him for a fun time.

Also to people who say the bread is sour.... have you ever had injera bread before??? It's supposed to be lightly sour... this bread wasn't that sour either I had to ask for lemon to make mine more sour. And as another poster said, the injera is served cold = NO NO. It made my dining experience that much worse for having cold injera."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is quite hidden inside a small street off Yonge street. The outside of the restaurant looks very different, not like the usual with just a sign. Just by looking on the outside, you know it's a family owned business. There's a few tables on the patio and also in the inside. If you want a table, you better come early and if you're coming with a large party, I highly suggest you to call ahead to make a reservation or come early to get a table. 

During the weekdays, there's only one server that works there, greets the guests, take orders, serves, cleans up and gets you the bill. Thus, service you can assume is quite slow and with 1 or 2 more tables, extremely slow service.

The menu section for food isn't too wide, a section for appetizers, beef/meats, vegetarian, that's basically it with drink menu as well. They have listed Ethiopian beer on the menu but they don't carry it, they have a beer from Kenya though which we ordered to try. It just tastes very light even lighter than regular light beer. almost felt like it was light beer diluted in ice. We ordered one with beef and veggies to share for 2 people. The amount of food that came look super small, the bread was a good portion for 2 people, but the amount of meat n veggies were only enough for 1 person. Other Ethiopian restaurants which I have been, usually gives enough meats and veggies for the amount of people ordering.

Taste of food was just ordinary, nothing that makes it taste extra good or stand out. The both of us were only 60% full walking out of that place. And we know we wouldn't be able to finish another one if we ordered one more. It felt really disappointing!

When we got our bill, it took SO LONG because there's only 1 server. The HST amounts and tax amounts were separated and looks confusing, I asked the server to explain why there's so many different HST amounts on the same bill, she came up with a bunch of reasons, which were super confusing and concluding it, she said \"I don't know\". 

**** I wouldn't come back to this place because choices are limited, service is slow, food portions are small and tastes ordinary."}
{"text":"OK, my last visit was no good, but this one was FAR better. The owner was in and serving - very friendly man. The food came out promptly and warm, and I enjoyed the meal. I'm encouraged to revisit soon!"}
{"text":"I'm always conflicted about Ethiopian food. I love the flavours of the cuisine, but I never really enjoyed injera. This was the first place where I thought the injera was pretty good. However the dishes we got were somewhat hit or miss. One of the dishes we got was way over seasoned and we couldn't finish it. The rest were pretty good. The host was also really nice and attentive. It was a good experience overall, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"It's a nice little place between Welesley and Bloor on Yonge. It looks like a house they converted into a restaurant. I had never had Ethiopian food before; it reminded me very much of Tamil food. The dishes are all served on a large piece of bread called Injera, which is reminiscent of a fleshier dosa crossed with appam. (It's basically a crepe like bread.) We asked them to pick a mix of stuff for us: half meat half vegetarian. The meat dishes were a bit spicy, though I imagine they could have made it crazy hot had we asked them. The vegetarian dishes were mild, and were straight out of Sri Lanka. It's strange how similar the food was. Everything was very tasty; we all enjoyed it. (If you're a vegetarian it is definitely worth checking out, because the vegetarian dishes aren't an afterthought.) We had Ethiopian coffee after our meal, which was excellent. You need to order it before your meal because it takes them a good while to prepare it. There is a bit of ceremony involved in the whole process, with them bringing you the beans as they roast them for you to smell, and bringing everything out with some burning frankincense. Ethiopian House was quite nice. The staff are friendly, and the food is good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent service are some of the reasons to visit this Ethiopian spot. The food is as close as you get to authentic Ethiopian food in the West. I love their tasty veggie combo which is fresh and plentiful."}
{"text":"I have visited this place so many times. I am very, very disappointed at this restaurant. 

I went to the restaurant for lunch menu at around 1pm. We ordered 5 dishes for 5 adults. 

The service was horrible. 
The server was unwilling to change the order after 2-3 minutes. She ended up making a mistake in taking order and charged us an extra dish. 

\"I am sorry but you have to pay\" while she was taking the dish away. So we decided to take it anyway. 

She never bother to ask us if the food is okay. I had to stood up three times for napkin, water, and spoon. 

That's it. I do not want to go back. The food is great but it really ruined our family time."}
{"text":"This is a great family restaurant.  I get the vegetarian platter every time.  My only complaint is that sometimes the charcoal used for cooking or Ethiopian coffee makes the whole restaurant a little hazy.  It is the best injera in the downtown Toronto core by far!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly average Ethiopian food.   100% acceptable but not special.

So, I'm a bit of an Ethiopian connoisseur...I've had it in areas with large Ethiopean/Eritrean populations like DC, Oakland, NYC, Seattle, and quite a few more places.  This means I'm a little picky.

This restaurant produces a competent version of many of your Ethiopian standards.  We had a veggie sampler and a small meat combo. I quite enjoyed the lentils which were well-done here.  Most of the veggies, however, lacked some of the complexity of flavor and spiciness (not necessarily hot spiciness) that have come to define good Ethiopian food for me.  The injera (the spongy sour-fermented bread) that one uses in lieu of utensils was a bit sweet and light for my taste.  I think perhaps they aimed for a more Americanized (I'm not sure if I can say Canadianized) palate.  

I like that they have kitfo on the menu, but I was not brave enough to order it in its full, completely raw, glory.  It was nice and buttery in its medium rare incarnation; however, it was lacking the spicing and heat that truly make it such an authentic dish.  Kudos for including this dish on the menu.  [For the curious, the Queen of Sheba on 46th Street/10th Ave in NYC has the best kitfo I've ever had.]  They do have a nice awaze (the wine/berbere hot sauce mix)...that helps spice things up.  

Service was fine, decor is a bit dated, and paying took forever!  I also found portions, especially of the veggies slightly on the small side."}
{"text":"Charming little authentic Ethiopian restaurant. The service is super friendly and the food is delicious. We ordered the veggie platter to share along with some beef accompaniments. The food was delicious and promptly served. It was quite busy but were seated fast and no lag in service. If you like eating with your hands and trying new things, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"After a week of planting daily subliminal and obvious messages to my sister about my desire to have Ethiopian, we finally went to Ethiopian House on our last night in TO. We had spent the evening at ROM and were in the general area of Bloor and Yonge. Besides, you can't really go have pub food after exploring all those great cultures and artifacts, can you? :-)   First thing - I really liked their injera because it didn't have the usual sour taste. I won't typically eat a lot of the injera and prefer using a fork. I don't like the extra carbs and besides, I'm really there for the flavor of the berbere in the doro wat and tibs awaze. In fact I could just spoon it up and eat it like soup if that weren't considered completely obnoxious. 

Made a new discovery -  I saw our server bring two sauces to a table next us: one green, one red. I never knew they had condiments!!  I'm all about condiments. The red is a chili pepper sauce and the green is jalepeno/garlic typce sauce. I'm going to have to ask for these at my 'go-to' places back home. The level of spiciness at Ethiopian House is quite mild. So the sauces would have been great.  I usually like to get a little bead of sweat going. But not tonight and not even after we each ate a  whole stuffed (raw) jalepeno. Maybe they have a lot of gringos that come in and they try to keep it on the safe side.  But the beef tibs awaze were nice and tender and the doro wat melted in your mouth! My experience in LA's Little Ethiopia on Fairfax, is that the beef is hit and miss. Too often I experience substandard beef quality - tough and dry. Yuck.

I want to add, the serivce was very friendly and relaxed. And, when I say relaxed, you regular Ethiopianphiles know what I mean. If you don't, my advice to you is that you should not be in a hurry. Be prepared to linger.... But hey, if I wanted to be rushed cuz the place wants to turn over tables, I'd go to freakin' Cheesecake Factory - home of the 1,500 calorie salad."}
{"text":"What a great night!

Friendly service and great prices.

I've been for Ethiopian many times but Friday night was my first time here. I will go back for sure! Cute decor, not too noisy, adorable little patio out front- what a neighbourhood gem! And, the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came by here tonight for some impromptu Ethiopian.  I've been to a few others in the city and can say that while the service is endearing at Ethopian House, the food is unremarkable, especially for the price.  As per usual, the food is to be shared and my friend and I split the vegetable combo platter on injera and a order of tibs.  

The veggies consisted of a iceberg lettuce salad with a lime vinaigrette centred on the injera, which while usual, definitely cut the richness of the lentil and spinach items.  The vegetarian items were alright, no real complaints here.  

Off to the side of the injera was a very modest serving of tibs, which considering the lack of flavour, was quite disappointing.  Tibs are what I look forward to most often: tender seasoned chunks of beef cooked in awaze.  Ethiopian House's offering was flavorless and slightly overdone, and the only redeeming instant was the section of injera soaked in the sauce. 

In all, I would look elsewhere in the city unless you really don't want to trek a little bit west.  If Ethiopian house improved their execution and maintained their standard of service, I would certainly return."}
{"text":"In a way, I'm happy that the UYE Okomoni House ended up not working out because I haven't had Ethiopian in a while. 

This resto broke my cherry concerning Ethiopian food a few years ago and I haven't looked back since. I love the variety of dishes you get with one platter, ranging from mild to spicy, and all to be wrapped up in spongy goodness. 

With all of the reviews previously written about this place, it's difficult for me to write something new. I do agree that it took a long time for our food to arrive, even though two factors played into the slow service such as 1) our group was 14 people, and 2) it was a busy Saturday* night. But the coffee took forever that I was wondering if we had ordered it at the beginning or not. 

The one thing I did learn that night was to ask the chef to pick out the dishes for us. I thought we had to stick to the menu but I guess this way we get sample what the chef likes the best. Thanks to Susan C who initially suggested it; I'll keep this in mind for future visits. 

My only complaint of the night was the AC. It blasted on me throughout the evening, which made my experience uncomfortable. While I would have liked to have imagined me sitting in Addis Ababa instead of Antarctica, perhaps I would suggest the fine folks at Ethiopian House to turn the AC one or two degrees lower.

This dinner only confirms that I must enjoy more Ethiopian food more often.

3.5 stars for my overall experience.

*Edited: it was Friday night, not Saturday."}
{"text":"the food is amazingggg.... i crave for the injera and doro wat every week or biweekly thats how addicted i am.. the ambience is nothing to boast about yet i would make all my friends go here whenever they come new to Toronto. I have removed the one star due to the waitress. I have seen her quite commonly there and she is really rude. The owner or manager is very friendly and I did mention to him how rude she was but unfortunately he dint take account of that because probably she is related to him. I would really like her to learn customer service but the food is definitely on my top list now!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food in a cute little house.  For our last Canadian meal, my friend and I wandered up Younge street to find this gem.  We were pleased to find lunch specials.  I was disappointed, however, to see that they didn't serve lamb, which is one of my favorite things to have at an Ethiopian restaurant.  
We had the vegetarian plate and it was excellent.  Everything was super flavorful and there were at least 6 different dishes.  
The only drawback was the service.  The waitress appeared annoyed at our presence and she disappeared for long periods of time.  
But, overall, not a bad way to leave Canadia."}
{"text":"I am visiting from New York, and walked to this establishment. The food was fresh, and prepared in a timely manner. Muhammad was a kind and warm host that made me feel welcome and excited to eat. 

I'll be back! 

Btw I got the cabbage and string beans--both delicious."}
{"text":"Beef Tibs was ok but the bread was doughy and under baked. The price was good. I liked the decoration and the staff were friendly. 
All in all it's a good place to try but I won't be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time rating this because I never had Ethiopian food before. I heard from friends that this place is authentic so I decided to try it out. We ordered the veggie and meat platter for two as recommended by our waitress. It came out in a giant plate with a nice woven cover/lid which was visually appealing. It was mostly an assortment of veggie spreads and 2 meats. I believe the meats were pork (cubed and grounded). The cubed pork was one of my favourites along with one of the yellow spreads. It was not explained to us what was in each spread so I apologize for the vagueness. The meal came with a pita bread of a sponge-like texture. The spreads were warm and the bread was not. 

Overall, for $32 this meal was expensive for what it was in my opinion. The taste was average but if I were to be more honest, it just wasn't my type (2/5). The waitress was nice and the service wasn't slow. The interior decor reflected the culture. I'm still glad I came here."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food, but right now I'm not loving it in Toronto. This is the third attempt to find decent Ethiopian food in the city and it is definitely the third failure. We ordered on vegetarian combo and one meat combo (which had kitfo, raw of course, and tibs). The kitfo was ok, and probably the highlight of the meal, though it was a bit gritty. The tibs were tough and not very flavorful. The vegetables were mostly on the bland side and uninspired. What really took this from dissapointing to I'm not going to be back here land was the injera, which was both cold and kind fo clammy feeling. It was definitely an unappetizing texture and we both commented that we didn't want to hold it in our hands. Service was friendly, and quick. We were revenously hungry and cleaned our plates. Portions were definitely on the small size."}
{"text":"YUM!

Saturday night, 4 of us went to Ethiopian House for the first time. We sat outside and enjoyed the people watching of the World Pride Festival. Our adorable waitress took good care of us, although we did have to track her down to get the check.

The food was awesome. I usually like my Ethiopian a bit spicier but the flavors were spot-on. We shared a 4-person Vegetarian Bayaaynatu; a sampler with 8 different delectable vegetarian dishes served on a large communal dish with ample and tasty injera bread to soak up the luscious flavors. Bite after bite after bite of edible happiness at a good price. 

We talked about the scrumptious meal throughout the remainder of the weekend. Awesome."}
{"text":"This narrow two-storey building near Welsley Station has a wonderful atmosphere, complimented by the aroma of freshly-ground coffee and the warm smiles of the friendly staff.  Over the years, I've brought friends and family, including my mother and my entire ESL class (on separate occasions) here for their first experience with Ethiopian food; rarely does one leave disappointed.  Make note that this place gets busy at night on the weekends.

I've been here nearly twenty times now; the food remains consistently good and the lingering smell of spices on my hand leaves me salivating long after I've left the restaurant!  The cold appetizers, despite their petite size, are tasty and worth a try.  At $8, the vegetarian lunch special is the best bang for your buck,  while dinner will run you approximately $12.50 a head.  The sherro wot and kiki wot - both in berebere sauce - are my favourites, but order the vegetarian bayaaynatu (mixed platter) if you want to try everything.  One large platter here will easily satiate three people or two with a ravenous appetite."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food at this place. The best Ethiopian food I've ever had. I'm serious, it's awesome!

The only down side is that if you are planning on going on the weekend, you really really need to make reservations or you may be waiting a while. The place is packed; rightfully so."}
{"text":"Really great experiences each time I visit Ethiopian House Restaurant! My first time was for a friend's birthday, and the food really surprised me (it was my first time trying any Ethiopian food) - it was so flavourful and spicy and tasty! The waitress suggested we get the Tibs, which was pieces of beef cooked with vegetables and peppers, served on top of injera, their flatbread. Very delicious, and I've been getting it almost every time since! It's definitely my favourite dish at this restaurant. The injera is not really a flatbread - it's more of a chewy crepe that is slightly sour. The taste is off-putting for some, as many of my friends don't enjoy the taste of sour crepes, but I really enjoy it (especially when eaten with the deliciously spicy beef!)

No cutlery is offered at this restaurant, so everything must be eaten by hand. It's a very cool experience and I would definitely recommend you try it, especially if you've never had Ethiopian food before!"}
{"text":"Some have asked whether Injera bread is gluten-free. Well, that's a sticky subject.  TEFF, an ancient grain, is gluten-free. It's what makes the Injera black. However, from what I have heard there are other grains mixed in. Somehow I've never had an issue, but in the past have called ahead to request 100% TEFF flour. I'm on a mission to go where no celiacs have gone before!"}
{"text":"This is a really good find! It's a small, little restaurant with sort of demented decor, but the food is excellent. 

I went with my sister and husband and we were sat down in the small space. Ethiopian is eaten with your hands, so I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. The bathroom is upstairs where there is another upper part of the restaurant and a small bar. 

The bathroom was clean, although I did notice a cockroach trap in the corner. I want to specify that the washroom was perfectly clean and I never saw any bugs. It was mildly disconcerting, but you'd probably be hard pressed to find any restaurant in downtown without a stray roach SOMEWHERE kicking around in it. Let's just be real!

Anyway, myself and my sister ordered a combo dish of a small portion of all of their veggie options, for two. My husband ordered their \"special\",which was a chicken dish, served with a whole, hard boiled egg.

Our meals arrived and my sister and my meal, was served on a large platter, with spoonfuls of the various dishes all around and a small salad in the middle. Certain parts were better than others, but that's probably a personal preference and nothing was bad. Just good and GOODER (yeah, I KNOW it's not a word).

The prices were also extremely reasonable. The portions of injera (the flat bread you eat the food with) were large and we were given 2 pieces each. That's ALL you would need, but if you're REALLY hungry, the food is served on a large piece of it, so you can literally eat your plate. 

Those are the good things. Now onto the not so good things.

The service was a little lacking. We ordered their special coffee at the beginning of the meal, as requested in the menu, only to be told they were not serving it anymore that day. We were there at around 8:30 and the restaurant closes at 11pm, according to their website. Why was it no longer being served??

Our waitress seemed sort of displeased with us being there in general. She was not very friendly. She avoided eye contact with us most of the night, which made it really hard to get her attention to get the bill and to pay. 

My sister and I were sitting across from each other and when our food was served our injera was on one plate. I asked if I could have another plate, to put my injera on and I got the dirtiest look you could imagine and the waitress turned on her heel without a word. She did get us a plate though. 

Normally, this type of service would be a real turn-off, but honestly the food was so damn good and the prices so damn good, I'm not even going to let it deter me! 

I WILL be back Ethiopian House Waitress! You can't keep me away!"}
{"text":"The Vegetarian Lunch Special ($7.45) is a great deal and one of the best lunch options in the Yonge & Bloor area. Available between 12pm and 3pm, the special consists of small samples of each of their eight vegetarian dishes served on injera. Quality of the dishes is on par with the best Ethiopian places in Toronto.

If multiple people are eating you can get individual or shared platters, but go for the shared platter 'cause it's more fun.

For those unfamiliar with Ethiopian food, the majority of the vegetarian dishes consist of lentils or split peas in a mild sauce. There are also a couple mixed vegetable dishes and one with collard greens. The vegetarian dishes tend to be very mild, while the meat dishes can be more spicy. All dishes are eaten with the hands using injera, a spongy flat bread with a somewhat sour taste.

The guy that runs this place is super cool. It appears to be a one man show, though, so if you're in a rush come early because it can be very slow during peak times. The decor, music, and smell of frankincense in the air also add to the experience."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard Ethiopian place, no better or worse, in terms of food, service or decor than you'll find at any of the Ethiopian places in Toronto. It is a step up from Nazareth I'd say in terms of food, but just as good as Lalibela (which is my usual go to). If you find yourself near Bloor and Yonge, this place is pretty good, but I'm not making a special trip for this place. 

The vegetarian dinner platter is quite a decent size and two people may have trouble finishing it (we didn't finish it). But I also discovered that Ethiopian left overs are pretty dammed good!

I do recommend that people have the coffee (no matter which Ethiopian place you are at). It's just a lovely way to end the meal, and always great coffee. Especially at this place. 

I've been here a few times and always thought it was just a small downstairs space but I just discovered yesterday they have a whole upstairs seating area, that's also where the washrooms are. 

In the summer they have a small cute patio out front."}
{"text":"Yelp should allow me to give 3.75 stars which this place deserves.

Blasphemously, I am gonna say that I loved the food at Ethiopian House waaay more than the original Ethiopian food, which I have had a surfeit of.

Now some points to back up aforementioned statement:
1)The injera (sourdough pancake) is not 1/10th as sour as what Ethiopians eat at home. The injera at Ethiopian House is tasteless, which trust me is a good thing, cuz you don't want to be puckering up after every bite.
2) The food isn't half as oily as what Ethiopian people eat at home
3) They cook their meats more; ergo more tender

Now for my overall experience: we went as a large group, and ordered two vegetarian platters and one meat platter. The vegetarian platter has a smattering of yellow lentils, cabbage, spinach, potates and carrots; none of which were  spicy. I had something very interesting: jalapeno peppers filled with salsa of some sort: I loved it!

The meat platters came with tibs (sauteed cubes of beef), kitfo (minced beef), mixed cheeses and something else I forget. All the meat was very well done and flavored. 

Even though the 10 of us gorged on the food, we had about 50 lbs of delicious leftovers. If only we could make stock out of it!

Overall, I really enjoyed the meal even though I was very trepidatious at first. The service was a tad slow, but given all the conversation no one minded. The interiors are a bit tacky, but that's a meh point.

I am going back fo shizzles!"}
{"text":"Great place with nice decor! 

It's my first time having Ethiopian food and I'd definitely have some more!! HOW MUCH I LOVE USING MY HANDS : ) 

The portion is a bit small though a bit more meat would be good."}
{"text":"I'm eating here right now.  Let me tell you all I have an OCD with getting my hands dirty when eating I've thrown out burgers and crepes just because it dripped!  But...  this food was so good I actually got my hands dirty!!  I even ate the food without the bread... Just with my hands!!! Ahhh fear conquered?  No way my napkins are a mess!!! 

The ground beef I had was a little spicy and for two people I'm walking out semi full that's why they lost a star.  However, wanda's waffle is right across the street so maybe not too bad!!

Anyways service is good very fast and honest!  Food is good, so good I'd come back.I ordered the special I attached a picture sorry I started eating before I thought of my fellow yelpers! 

Total: 30.49!  Not bad"}
{"text":"First time I went to Ethiopian House a few years ago it was Great! Visited for dinner 2 days ago and it was terrible. Service was awful, table was dirty, food was cold and not good. Worst service I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Despite how squishy this little dining room can get, the cheerily colourful decor and the flavourful finger fare is well worth a visit. The service is pleasant and as long as a carafe of house wine arrives immediately, the wait for the food is hardly noticeable.

Sharing is caring and there's no better way to get a taste of everything than to split a huge platter of vegetarian bayaaynatu which includes eight delightful samples of everything that's on the veg menu and is served with loads of moist and spongey injera. While the dishes are spiced well enough on their own, the two chili dips provided add a nice kick too."}
{"text":"Being that it was my first Ethiopian experience, I had no idea what to expect. After a pleasant dining experience I had at Ethiopian House Restaurant, I can gladly say I will be returning in the near future.

My friends and I weren't sure what to get, so the waitress recommended a platter for us to share, which includes veggie, meat, and chicken options. Along with a big platter of assorted colors and favours, we each also got two rolls of injera; which served as the perfect utensil to absorb and grab just the right amount of each dish in our platter. The portion was huge for three people, and it came out to ~$17 per person. 

If you're sitting on the fence about trying something new, you should definitely step out of your comfort zone and give this place a try. I guarantee you'll be pleasantly surprised about how flavourful and delicious everything is!"}
{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian food (so i don't have much to compare it to), but i enjoyed it. The place has interesting decor that's fun to look at (including some erotic-ish artwork in the washroom). It's got 2 floors and if you're upstairs it kind of feels like they've forgotten about you at times, but otherwise good service.

We ordered the mixed vegetarian dish for two and it was good, nice to try a whole bunch of different dishes.  Was much more filling than it looks, but don't forget to wash your hands because you'll be eating with them.  They had a coffee/tea ceremony thing which looked really cool, will have to give that a try next time."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and had never had Ethiopian food before. Asked for guidance from server who suggested a sampler, for lack of a better word. Mix of beef and vegetables. Very tasty. Great flavors. Server at first seemed less than interested but in the end--literally when I went to pay--she engaged me in conversation and for first time, she smiled looked me in the eye and was friendly.  Could've just been busy or focused on her job....  Regardless, I would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"Not bad (but I still much prefer Nazareth for Ethiopian).

The food took agggeeessss to come out. I get cranky when the food takes a long time. I've tried 4 Ethiopian places in the city and they all take a long time though, not sure if it's the cooking process or what. But this place was the slowest of the slow.

But hey, they did take our party of 15 people at 730pm on a Friday night with no reservation. Props to them.

Food was pretty good, we had some kind of assorted platter with nearly everything on the menu, half veg and half meat options. I\"m a hardcore meat eater but with ethiopian food I always prefer the vegetarian dishes better (various lentils, stewed yams, sauteed cabbage, etc)

Decor was somewhat unusual :) Lots of boobies and stuff"}
{"text":"Reeeally, really good food :) I've been to a couple of Ethiopian restaurants around Toronto and this one is by far my favourite. The atmosphere (especially at night) can be really intimate, making it a great place for a date or to chill a friend or too. And it's a whole new eating experience since you're essentially eating with bread rather than with a knife and fork. Looks like it might be hard to fit a group larger than 4, but I could be mistaken - it's two levels but I've only ever sat on the first floor. They have good combinations of veg, meat, and meat/veg if you just want to try a bit of a bunch of dishes. Going at lunch can be cheap since they have a lot of deals."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The service is fast, the servers are polite, and the food is delicious! The restaurant has a very authentic feel, and the aroma of the coffee fills the establishment.  I almost always order the vegetable platter for two people, which comes with injera bread on the side. If you like your food spicier (which I do) then definitely ask for Mitmita (a deliciously spicy powdered seasoning mix used in Ethiopia). I have tried many Ethiopian restaurants in Toronto, and this is the only one that I always return to - in my opinion it's the best in the city! I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here and shared a meat and veggie bayanatu platter.  It was neat to eat without utensils and rely on the bread to hold your food. I liked how everything was presented and I didn't feel sleepy from food coma after having this meal.  It was a nice day to sit on the patio and the service was good.  It is close to work so will probably come back for lunch!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Ethiopian food. I ordered a dish I believe it was called tips or tibs which is basically a beef stew and a salad served on the inerja(Spongy flat bread). I enjoyed the flavour of the beef and the salad. After a few bites of the bread I decided I did not really like the taste of it. I think this type of cuisine is just not my thing.

The décor was  very interesting. The owner was serving us and he was very pleasant and cheerful. Prices seemed reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was good, but it can't have been that good since when I think back to it the thing that stands out most seems to be running into my old roommate from university. Don't get me wrong, I like him, but I see him all the time, and I usually remember the food after a good meal, not the circumstances. 

I would recommend Dukem on the Danforth over Ethiopian House. Less centrally located but more authentic and better tasting food in my opinion. Trust me, apparently my grandfather spend 20 years in ethiopia. so something must have rubbed off on me."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what else I can say that hasn't already been said about this place.  For my first Ethiopian experience it was great.  The food is simple but delicious.  You'll definitely want to keep track of your consumption of injera as you'll fill up fast before the real food is gone.  I'm not a coffee drinker but the coffee presentation was really cool.  The drink was poured for us while frankincense burned in the middle of the table.  I was also quite surprised how busy this place was.  I guess considering there aren't many options for this cuisine Ethiopian House is the place to be."}
{"text":"I really do love the food. It's delicious, and consistently so. But man alive is the service bad. Like, really bad. Slow and disinterested. You'll almost never get a second drink and you'll wait 20 minutes for your bill once you've asked. The food keeps me coming back though, especially those tasty beef tibs."}
{"text":"This has really become my go-to place for the occasional Ethiopian craving! I usually come for the lunch specials but after convincing another couple to give Ethiopian a try, we came in on a Saturday evening. Mohammed is so welcoming and even though the restaurant is quite understaffed, he has away of making you welcome. He even stopped us from ordering to much. 
We got a large platter with all the veggies and lentils, kitfo, tibs and the weekend only doro wat (or chicken stew). All the food couples with the injera was absolutely delicious and each type had its own unique flavor. 

If you haven't had Ethiopian before, think of it like - the flavours of Indian cuisine without the spicy heat and the overbearing abundance of spices. This is not to say anything bad about Indian food because I love it but it's just to highlight what you may expect. 

Most importantly - there isn't any cutlery here so get over having to eat with your hands. 

Great for: first dates, dinner with friends, lunch alone, an interesting meal.... the list goes on."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and the owner is extremely friendly. We usually get one meat and one veggie bayanatu with a side of the mit mit powder. For the relevant dishes they cook your meat to your liking.
My only cons for this place is that I find it kind of dirty and cramped and some of the women staff are not as friendly as the owner sometimes. However, the service is fast and the food is really good. I believe the pricing is standard."}
{"text":"This review is for the last time I went to Ethiopian House, which was over a year ago. Ethiopian House used to be one of my favourite spots for Ethiopian food, but on my last visit, I found that it had gone downhill.

My go-to dishes were the vegetarian combination platter and the Bozena Shiro. The food was not as fresh and flavourful as it used to be. Portions are smaller than before."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! make sure to get a reservation otherwise you'll be waiting for some time

the service is very fast with no bullshit chit chat. the place is decorated quite brightly- which adds to its authentic feel. we ordered the vegetable platter for two people which was $25, it was amazing!!! it comes with 8 dishes and injera bread on the side. the dishes range from lentils to beans to spinach
i had tea on the side to help move along the meal, because it is quite a lot to eat 
would definitely go here again for the food and experience"}
{"text":"With high expectations we went to this restaurant. We had tried few restaurants on danforth in little Ethiopia and enjoyed the food. But this restaurant wasn't great. There was only one person serving and we found him not too polite. There was no chicken or goat meat in the restaurant. Only options were beef or veg. We ordered the lunch specials. Food came quickly. The quantity was very less, doro wat tasted good but rest of the stuff was tasteless. Never going there again !!"}
{"text":"The food is alright, but these guys have pests and got a yellow card a few days ago I believe. I checked out the rest of the restaurant, and no wonder they had pests. Their kitchen door is wide open right next to their messy garbage disposal- yuck!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely plain and the service was not good. They'll tell you to use hands at first even though you ask for forks. But you still got fork in the end, don't know what's point of that."}
{"text":"A place to take your time, especially if you want the coffee service (which is fun and worth doing but you either need to call ahead or settle in for the long haul).

I really enjoy Ethiopian food and haven't been disappointed here.  The veggie platter is varied and flavorful.  They also make fantastic injera (the bread) which is essential to the experience.  

The atmosphere is relaxed with a comfortable ambiance that matches the slow pace.  Don't come in a hurry and you'll leave happy."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Toronto on a yearly basis for the last 10 years and usually stop by this restaurant at least once.  The excellent food and friendly service have not varied one bit--what a model of consistency!  

This place is very small, but there are two floors and there is a patio.  The entire party's orders are presented together on one plate atop a big fat spongy injera bread, which soaks up the sauce during the meal to become a most tasty last item to eat.  Lunch specials are very convenient since about 5~7 items are sampled together.  Lentils, peas, marinated minced meat (kitfo), sauteed meat (tib), barely cooked beef (called Gored-gored, not a part of the specials and quite unusual), stewed veges, salad.  Everything is great, I especially love the kitfo and tib.  Every time I eat Ethiopian food the word earthy comes to mind when thinking about the food, in a good way.  Very interesting are a smoky dipping sauce and a pungent, aloe-like green paste.  I just grab bite-sized injeras from the bread basket and snatch foods with it.  It's a fun eating process especially with people comfortable with it.  I sometimes see people requesting silverware, that's FAIL, please just don't do it.  Eat with your hand.  

Since my yearly trip to Toronto might be coming to an end soon, I will really miss this place that's always been there for me!"}
{"text":"First timer for Ethiopian food, and first time here.  Service was OK, and helpful explaining the recommended dishes.  

Had the combos, and was disappointed.  The portion sizes were miserly, and some of the lentil dishes tasted like the spices were not properly mixed in.

Overall, for someone who is very familiar with Indian food, this was without flavour.  A plate of differently coloured slurry.  Perhaps this is why the restaurant was almost completely empty.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"An amazing place! I might not be an expect on Ethiopian cuisine, but the food is delicious and the staff is so kind, it is so atmospheric there with the decor and music and everything. It is truly an experience. And my favourite part is the coffee ritual. You have to order it 30-40 minutes in advance, but they bring the roasted beans for you to smell and it is the most amazing tasting coffee! Their house wine (only tried white) also never disappoints! Have been there 5 times and keep coming back for more! :)"}
