{"text":"Loveeeee Coco Brooks!   I work in the area, and the guys at our shop are always requesting coco brooks for our staff lunches. Even when we place a big order during lunch, its still ready in 15 minutes. Can't go wrong with it, its delicious!"}
{"text":"I like the concept of Coco Brooks. Fast food meets pizza parlour.  They have a huge variety of pizzas. We don't go often, but when we do I always declare (to myself anyway) that I will one day try every item on the menu. But I'm not even close. Each pizza has more than ample toppings and the pizzas are crazy hot (and hold their heat for a long time??). The ingredients are of a good quality and they do some interesting flavour combos.  I really like a lot of their vegetarian options (even though I am a meat eater). THeyy also have recently beefed up their side options with a range of salads available (that I also intend to try!) They have tasty smoothies too. I'm a fan of the peach mango myself, so much so that I always try to ingest it a little fast and have brain freeze within 10 seconds of having it handed to me.  Service is decent, friendly and pretty quick. It would be nice if they were open Sundays. That's my only complaint really."}
{"text":"This is my NTh time going to this place so I have to rate it, been a customer once and I tried their pizza before, I'm impressed with the homey taste and freshness of the ingredients. I love how the package comes with stories to inspire you or just to keep you company while out for a quick bite, my all time fave are ala mo wana, Italian and the banana slice. Try this place, it's not as pricey, good food and great atmosphere, plus, good service, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, but too much religious crap!   Coco Brooks makes a good Greek-style pizza, but you have to be careful what you get because the \"pepperoni\" is sliced from very low-grade pepperoni sticks, and it tastes like hot dogs hahah! Also, I can't stand all of the religious crap printed on their boxes and stuff... stop pushing your silly creation myth on me already!"}
{"text":"GLUTEN FREE PIZZA!  Ok, got that out of my system. The real news is that you no longer have to purchase frozen pizza and take them home to heat them.  HOT GLUTEN FREE PIZZA NOW IN STORE. Oh gee, I'm really excited about that.   I travel from Edmonton and usually stock up every couple of months with 8-10 frozen gluten-free pizzas. While I can't say anything about the regular pizzas - the gluten friendly flavours are really delicious.   Tried a new pizza this time - the Palazzo. I think it's my favourite so far!  Should have purchased more.   Service Really good. Sometimes you can stand at the counter waiting for someone to acknowledge you for a while, but I'm willing to wait. Perhaps they can't see you, maybe a doorbell to the back might help. They are always happy to check in stock product, and I've never met anyone behind the counter who wasn't good to deal with.  Fundraisers If you can purchase your frozen pizzas through a school or other fundraiser, it's a great way to support everyone and get a fantastic product.  Salt.  If you want it for your salad because you can't eat the dressing... you'll need to bring your own.  Salt isn't good for you, they don't have any available. Can't say I disagree, but until now, salad was all I could eat there if we decided to eat in.  Smoothies Again - a real winner. I'm not a fan of smoothies, but the strawberry banana is something I bee-line for when I visit. Not expensive either.  Environment They care. They really do."}
{"text":"Yet another fantastic Calgary pizza place that I have to fight with myself not to eat at every day!   Coco Brooks is a pizza making machine-factory-wonderland! They have a bajillion (bajillion = 40ish) kinds of pizzas that all come in one size. Personal!  That said, a personal pizza at Coco Brooks is still a very good amount of food at a great value. I often attempt to break it up into two meals, eating two pieces now, and saving the last two for later. 20 minutes later, however, I'm staring at an empty pizza box thinking \"Man, that was tasty!!\"  They've also got a good assortment of Salads, and healthier alternatives, that I've never had, mind you. But, it makes them a great choice if you need to buy food for a large group of people. They have a diverse enough menu to accommodate many different eating eating styles and dietary requirements. And since no one can ever agree on what type of pizza to order, with Coco Brooks, everyone gets there own!  Coco Brooks has a lot of spirit, and a lot of personality. There are inspirational stories written on the lids of their boxes. I didn't know that I wanted to contemplate life and love while munching on a pizza...but as it turns out, I love the stories, and I leave feeling both full and happy."}
{"text":"Is it the best pizza in town? Not quite...   Then why do I keep coming back? Because it's one of the best Personal pizza spots in Calgary. The size is perfect and the price is very reasonable!  Food - 4/5 Service - 4.5/5 Ambience - 4/5 Quality - 4/5  I have eaten here many times and it's been a consistent quality experience. Definitely try it out! If you want to grab a pizza by yourself or with a few friends you can't go wrong, plus everyone can get the pizza they want and share"}
{"text":"Great pizza place with great value. The decor is very dated and the temperature not very comfortable for dine in. Would be a higher star rating if these two items are fixed."}
{"text":"I came to this location for lunch. No problem finding parking or seating, granted we arrived after the noon-ish rush. There's ample seating for those who want to dine in. One thing I found was that while waiting for my pizza, I was always in the way of someone... either trying to reach the drink/supplies on the right-hand side, or people delivering/picking up pizzas, or waiting to order.   Coco Brooks pizza is good. Not great, not amazing. I know a lot of people think it's to die for, but I still wouldn't go out of my way to grab some if there was something else available. Sorry! :)"}
{"text":"I was working for a client in this industrial section of town, and this fast food looking restaurant was across the street. They told me that I must go. I went with a little skepticism, and I left a believer (well, that has double entendre here a this Christian owned restaurant). I loved the sign -- \"a people company serving pizza' -- which is my philosophy about how great restaurants and companies think. I entered to find a very lengthy menu with a lot of pizza options. I chose the Athens Greek pizza for $6 (Canadian). It was absolutely phenomenal. I was only going to eat two slices and save the rest for later, but I had to eat the whole thing. The ingredients were perfectly combined, and the whole meal very filling and a great value. And yes, the pizza boxes are some inspiring fun reading too. God bless."}

{"text":"If you're looking for personal pan pizza with big tastes. Look no further, Coco Brooks is the place you want to be at.   They normally extremely busy around lunch, so be sure to call in and order ahead if you're on a tight schedule."}
{"text":"I have worked in several different locations all around Calgary and I find the same thing happening time and time again. Lunch consists of the same stuff every day and it all just becomes too played out for existence. But with this great little pizza spot I've seen the light! I could eat off of there menu day after day and it still doesn't feel played out.  The service always comes with a smile and I'm very rarely left waiting for my order. The pizza is top notch for a quick order pizza joint and i have yet to be disappointed by the flavors in any of the countless choices.  I've seen a lot of fellow Yelpers criticizing them for placing religious stories on the inside of the box. Now I'll be the first to tell you how very non-religious I am, so should I be offended that somebody wants to write a religious story on my pizza box?! HOGWASH! Its like somebody being offended that another wrote about a food that they're allergic to. If it would really ruin your day to read something religious while you enjoy one of the best quick order pizzas out there, then just don't read it!  All in all I will be returning there over and over again till I've carb loaded myself into a delicious pizza coma..and I'd recommend everyone does the same!  Cheers and happy Yelping!!"}
{"text":"I've dined in once at this location and today I had take-out.  Can pizza be light and fluffy?  That's what comes to mind with the four personal sized pizza's my two friends and I sampled.  We had Pepperoni Mushroom, Italian Sausage, Mexican and BBQ Chicken.  It was all good and I noted that the Mexican was particularly spicy, which I enjoyed.  The pizza is somewhat greasy but it also stayed quite hot for a long time.    To be honest, I could easily mow through at least one personal pizza by myself if I'm hungry and could probably eat close to two if I wanted to get ridiculous.  I try not to eat pizza often but was reminded that the prices seem reasonable."}
{"text":"I actually went to the Kingsland Farmer's Market location but I'm too lazy to add it to the list. \"Tsk tsk Heather, half a job\" - my Dad whenever I'm 'too lazy' to do something.  So I work in marketing and I've done the occasional naming exercise, whether for products, or lines of business, or even businesses themselves.  Before I found out that Coco Brooks was a pizza place here's what I might have said....  Hmmm....Coco...maybe they sell coconuts? Or chocolate? Or strippers?  Oh, well then there's Brooks in there confusing me....I know Brooks is a sporting goods store but that doesn't seem to fit with Coco.  Maybe it's a brook like a river, or it IS a last name, but I didn't think that strippers even had last names.  NEVER in my wildest dreams would I have thought it was a pizza place.  And, never would I have guessed that they would use the packaging on their pizza to attempt to impart godly wisdom upon pizza eaters.  I bought 2 pizzas, the Big Al's (aka meat frenzy) on a traditional crust and the Sicilian on a gluten-free crust.  Now, I'm not a scientist (marketing, remember?) but I do understand proper experimental design.  And originally I thought I should probably cook both at once and evaluate them side by side.  Well, I was too lazy to do that so I enjoyed them on different days. (Tsk, tsk.)  Big Al's - Fantastic pizza. Guilty pleasure pizza. Maybe there's religious stuff on the box because you're likely to feel guilty after eating it.  Whatever.  You can put whatever you want on the box as long as long as that's as far as it goes.  I had to restrain myself against eating the whole thing.  (I should be clear here that while this is a tasty pizza, it's not high quality ingredients that make it tasty, it's the fat and carbs working their magic on your wired-for-survival, evolutionary-slow-to-change brain - sorry creationists.)  Gluten Free Sicilian - Horrible. I've had many GF pizza crusts before and this is an awful crust supporting an even worse cast of toppings.  I ate one piece and the rest is still in my fridge.   Final thoughts - don't get confused by the name like I did - this is a PIZZA place."}
{"text":"The best place in Calgary for a pizza lunch.  Their selections are great, their staff is friendly, and the seating area is always clean.  I think their only fault is that there isn't enough parking for the business lunch crowd during the week."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at their kids vegetarian pizza with a quinoa crust.  It was an amazing pizza and didn't feel guilty at all :)"}
{"text":"Wish they had more locations as there is no close by one to me. When I do crave thick pizza opposed to my usual floppy pizza addiction I will come here because they have the best crispy crust and their cheeseburger pizza is delicious! Not to mention they make a yummy banana bread with cream cheese frosting *DROOLS*"}
{"text":"Ohhh Coco Brooks how I love thee.  Despite their outward and obnoxious Ryder Nation garbage all over the restaurant, this place is AWESOME.  Their frozen pizzas are a staple in our house, we frequently stop in to pick up a bunch to take home.  They taste just as delicious as if you'd ordered one fresh from the restaurant.     My favourite from Coco Brooks though is the banana bread.. with a layer of cream cheese frosting in the center, it is delicious!"}
