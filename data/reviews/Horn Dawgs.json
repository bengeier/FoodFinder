{"text":"This was my first visit and I was impressed.   My husband and I ordered the beef brisket, which was amazing. The sauce was very good and they don't drench your sandwich. The beef was cooked well and tender.  The staff is very friendly; one of the girls even came over to give our baby some Easter chocolates.   Definitely coming back to try the chicken"}
{"text":"We  were at the woodbine Park Ribfest this weekend and picked Horn Dawgs  to sample  the ribs as they had the longest line and a huge display of trophies.  This Chicago girl has finally found great sweet BBQ  ribs in the Toronto area!  Split a rack of ribs and the \"can't decide\" pulled pork/brisket  combo  sandwich.  We were not disappointed. Came home with leftovers and a bottle of sauce.  Look forward to visiting restaurant in Pickering soon."}
{"text":"Wow. Bought the Baby Dawg and a pound of pulled pork. Absolutely excellent. Ribs. Lots of meat. Meat just fell off the bones. Included the fried chicken. Superb. Crispy. Nice and greasy. Tasty. Nice dark beef gravy. Our first time there. It certainly won't be the last. Ordered take out and was ready when they said it would be."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ spot. We ordered the Dawg combo (ribs, pulled pork, brisket, fries, 2 sides). 10 out of 10. The ribs were perfect. Sauce was really good, fall off the bone. Pulled pork was one of the best we've ever had. Brisket was really good as well. Had Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes for the sides, both were good. Really good value as well. Had enough for 4 people ($60). Also, hit up the booth at the Scarborough Ribfest. Had the Pulled Pork and Brisket on a bun, another masterpiece. Well done!!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ EATS from the Wings to the fried chicken, to the delicious ribs and beef brisket poutine. Also make sure you try the pulled pork. The Sauces are pretty good as well"}
{"text":"Small business win! Would recommend any local to visit! Great food, portions, service, price. Owner is a G. Try the \"can't decide poutine\"...it was great :D"}
{"text":"I came here with my family and we opted for:  ThePuppyDawg $62 Feeds 3-5 Full Rack of Ribs 1pound Wings  1pound Pulled Pork  1pound Beef Brisket 2 Medium Southern Sides Medium Fries  I asked to upgrade from fries to onion rings and they had no problem accommodating my request. There was a mix up however so we ended up with sweet potato fries, but this was corrected after the mix up. We were even allowed to keep the sweet potato fries since they would have just thrown them away. As our Southern sides we went with Southern Coleslaw and Mac n' Cheese.   I have to say my favourite part of this meal was the pulled pork. It was so tender, juicy, saucy, and delicious. The wings were really good too and a good size. I don't usually like brisket because its tougher meat, but there were some pieces that were more tender so I enjoyed it as well. The ribs were as good as always, nice and meaty. The Mac n' Cheese was great too, it went well with the pulled pork and brisket. The sweet potato fries and onion rings were nothing special, I've definitely had better, but that's okay because their specialty is meat.   It's so hard to find good BBQ places here so I'm glad Horn Dawg's did not disappoint. I will definitely be making future visits."}
{"text":"My wife and I are originally came out to the area where Horn Dawgs was looking for Hot Mama Noi's  Thai on the Fly. Once we saw Horn Dawgs a barbecue craving kind of kicked in. We decided to sample their small size poutine and their special pulled pork + with beans & mashed potatoes. The pulled pork was very tender beans were ok, gravy was good tho a tad on the salty side for us. We were also given a freebie cornbread muffin which was soft and tasted good. They have seemed to win a lot of awards for their barbecue and their trophies were all placed on a shelf visible to the customers. We intend to make a repeat visit when the weather is a little warmer to try their ribs and wings combo offering."}
{"text":"They came, they catered.  We had an end of summer work lunch and Horn Dawgs was called to feed the masses. We ordered Ribs, Mac N Cheese, Coleslaw, Brisket and Fried Chicken.  First, they DO NOT SKIMP. The trays were huge and we ALL took food home.   The biggest hits were the chicken and mac n cheese. The chicken was not greasy and the batter was to die for. We wished there were 2 trays of the chicken. The mac n cheese was creamy and cheesy as all heck.   The ribs were large and meaty. The brisket did not require chewing. They also gave us a bottle of sauce, in case we were feeling extra saucy.  We would absolutely call them again. The service was great and the food arrived hot. They were very upfront about how large the trays were and advised against ordering more for the size of our crowd. Appreciated it!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best ribs in TORONTO, Amazing fall of the bone. Only Con is the mac and cheese is bland. Pulled pork is amazing. BBQ sauce amazing  haven't tried the brisket but seein the rest of the meat options are A1 I would guess the brisket is also"}
{"text":"Ohhh you cant beat this one, the chili cheese fries are awesome.  These fries remind me of the hand made chip truck style fries topped with meaty chili, and parmasian cheese.  This is a contender for my new favorite place for lunch in the pickering area.  Texture, flavor, some zip to it all.  What an awesome creation.  The small is enough to fill ya up, but  hey why not indulge a bit.  Also got a pulled pork sammy to go, but that may have to wait for later.  It sounds like they are tweeking the menu so i cant wait to see what they come out with next."}
{"text":"I came here last week and decided to try the \"can't decide' poutine which came with cheese curds, pulled pork, brisket, and a choice of sauce on top in addition to standard gravy.  It was HUGE and I couldn't believe how much pulled pork and brisket they pilled on it was more than Ive had on a pulled pork sandwhich or brisket sandwhich at other joints.   I knew there was no way I was finishing it nor would I want to simply wouldn't have been too healthy I want to say I ate 45% of it but it was really good. The fries got soggy but I wasn't surprised how could they not with all that delicious meat, gravy, and sauce pilled on and I thought the value was fantastic for the portion size at $11.00. I liked the brisket but I would probably get just pulled pork next time because it was really good.  Edit: So I've become a recent here, especially on Wednesdays for their wing specials, they have GREAT wings for Great value.  I drop one star because the decor is pretty bad, you can barely tell theres a little bbq spot here I think you have to have known its there you would be unlikely to see it when driving by on Bayly and the Menu is so poorly laid out inside (its all over the wall) I was glad I checked it out online before going I know if my parents looked at it they would find it difficult to read and an annoyance.   Great food, bad looking spot!  After coming a few more times I've decided to give them a 4.5 still docking .5 for the decor but I'll round up to a perfect 5 :)"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Avoid the ribfest wait and go direct to the source! They have small eat in and also takeout. Meat eaters delight! :)"}
{"text":"Love the pulled pork/brisket sandwiches. The fried chicken is also delicious! Very flavourful and even better than KFC. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I did not discover this little place at Ribfest, we heard great reviews from friends and decided to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Greasy(which is what it is supposed to be I suppose), pricy for what it is, especially the 11$ brisket sandwich.  Flavour wise decent"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Wednesday evening. As we were first-timers here, we had loads of questions, especially on what to order if we wanted to try a bit of everything. The girl behind the counter was very willing to answer all our questions with big smiles. The service she provided us with later on also made our experience delightful.   Prior to visiting, I had decided I would come here to try all of: beef brisket, ribs, mac and cheese, beans, and poutine. After looking over the menu, I decided that I'd go for the half rack dinner (comes with six bones, fries, and a small side) with upgraded poutine ($2 extra), a pound of the beef brisket, and an extra medium side.   The food itself is pretty average.  Nothing about the meats particularly screamed unique to the joint but was definitely flavourful, tender, and juicy.  The poutine had a dark, rich, thick gravy that complimented the crispy fries and cheese curds. Quite a generous portion was packed into a box beside my ribs. The ribs were tender, fall off the bone with a delicious rib sauce.  The beef brisket was a little disappointing but that's only because I came in with expectations after seeing a picture of freshly sliced brisket with a beautiful red smoke ring around the edge. The brisket my friend and I were served did not look as such; just the average brisket.  The medium mac and cheese side was super creamy! Taste is also average.  The small side of baked beans I got with my half rack dinner was one of the favourites that night. A certain spice in the beans made it stand out from other baked beans I've tried from other BBQ joints.  Overall, a great experience because of the exceptional service provided by the girl behind the counter. I'd certainly come back again to try their other offerings like their fried chicken and \"sammiches.\""}
{"text":"Was an easy four star based on the ribs and the rib sauce but unfortunate the beef brisket fell on its face hard enough to warrant a 2/5 stars if I only tried that.  Ribs were quite good and tasty and not overladen with fat   Brisket was the worst I've ever had (I live close to Memphis) and to be honest I wouldn't even call it brisket but rather a smoked beef sandwich; hard pass on this one fellow yelpers  Update: I have found that there are more than just this place calling smoked meat beef brisket which led to my poor review here  The rib sauce was indeed good and the ribs were good for this side of the GTA, I just wish they would label their food properly and not make customers like you and me waste our hard earned money"}
{"text":"In comparison to places like Memphis BBQ and The Stockyards, this place is lacking in flavour and quality. I had their pulled pork poutine and usually that's a winning meal for me but their pork was dry and tasted strange and did not add a thing to the poutine. The gravy was okay but nothing special. I suppose for a small place out in pickering it's alright if you're really craving some BBQ and can't make it downtown Toronto or Woodbridge. Most likely would not return."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Pulled Pork Poutine or Beef Brisket Poutine Hmmmm..How about both!!? The Can't Decide poutine ($11) is perfect for indecisive people like me who just wants to try everything xD these yummy fries are drenched with hot gravy, cheese curds and topped with half pulled pork and half beef brisket! So evil, so unhealthy but super delicious (my forever dilemma)!  However, I was a little bit disappointed because the pulled pork was a bit cold :( it just ruined the poutine experience a little bit  Fiancé ordered the beef brisket sammich. He was fairly disappointed at the portion. Also, the buns were still cold. Maybe they weren't quite ready for business since we came at 12ish (they open at 12pm)?  I probably won't be going to Pickering anytime soon, but I will be sure to check out their ribs this year during rib fest because I did enjoy their bbq sauce!"}
{"text":"We love it. Great take out! Great to feed a crowd if you have company :)"}
{"text":"Wings were amazing and the onion rings- the batter is something completely different! The guy behind the counter was friendly! Loved it"}
{"text":"Finger lickin' good! I'd eat here every night if the wife would let me ;)  Best BBQ place in Durham! I recommend the brisket and the southern fried chicken."}
{"text":"Well, basically, all I can say is that this place is excellent. Boasting a slew of trophies from Rib Fests all over, they definitely delivered. Ribs were nice and tasty but neither too dry nor so overcooked they fell right off the bone. Their sauce is nice and flavourful as well.   Dinner combos come with fries which were good and a choice of mashed potato, gravy, cole slaw, cornbread, or absolutely excellent baked beans heavy on coarse black pepper for great flavour.  What really impressed me: they sell Cheerwine, a North Carolina soft drink kind of like cherry soda that is amazing. I've never seen it in Canada before and it accompanies barbecue perfectly.  Horn Dawg's offers take out as well as eat in, and an array of catering platters as well. Most impressive."}
{"text":"The only thing I've only ever ordered is a pound of mild wings and fries, but I can't even estimate how many pounds of these wings I have consumed at this point. The wings alone are worth a 5* review.   Best. Wings. Ever.   Eat them with ranch. Eat them with fries. Eat them alone. Eat them with friends. Eat them at home. Eat them at work. Eat them fresh. Eat them leftover. Try the wings. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and never disappointed. The wings are amazing, and not to be missed. What really impressed me was the size of the wings. Not those tiny 2 bites, but big meaty hunks. Even my kids love this place for the pulled pork poutine. The location is small with only a few seats, but the food is very good."}
{"text":"So I have to say that not only is the food excellent but the staff are outstanding. They catered my daughters wedding and provided first rate service whole over coming unexpected obstacles. Highly recommend  them."}
{"text":"We tried their brisket sammich and the ribs at the Pickering ribfest a few weeks ago but weren't quite that impressed.  The ribs were chewy and dry and the brisket was roughly pulled/chopped with some seriously large chunks of meat to tear off (this would have been fine had the brisket been cut against the grain but it was not).  I thought the flavour of the smoke and the sauce was just ok.    After a quick visit to the Miller waste yard, we found that HD BBQ was nearby so we decided to give them another try and ordered wings & 1/2 rack combo with fries and a 2 little pigs and a cow sandwich.    The sandwich arrived first and it was a much more pleasant experience than the brisket sammich we had encountered a few weeks back.  The pulled pork was juicy without being too stringy, couldn't really detect the large chunks of brisket that was too cumbersome to eat and the bacon that topped off the sandwich was just a yummy bonus.    The ribs fared much better this time as well.  I'm guessing quality control at ribfests can be rather difficult and I would like to think the HD BBQ maintains this quality of ribs on site.  The ribs were not fall-off-the-bone tender as they should be and the sauce provided on each table makes for a customizable ribbing experience.    The chicken wings were your run of the mill deep fried and tossed in sauce kind but also enjoyable enough.  Served alongside some excellent fresh cut fries, the meal was very very satisfying.    Do I think the HD BBQ is the be all and end all for BBQ in the GTA?  No, not really.  Will I return for more?  Sure, if I'm in the area and don't feel like driving further to Buster Rhinos."}
{"text":"HUGE HUGE HUGE PORTIONS!!!  It was almost as if they were closing for the night and they were giving me whatever they had left over. But it wasn't the case at all since they didn't close for another three hours.  I consider myself a big eater so I ordered a beef brisket sandwich $10 and a pulled pork poutine $10 like its a Big Mac Combo. I thought to myself; I could handle a sandwich with some fries no problem. When my food arrived I was blown away at how big everything was and I knew I had a monster of a challenge to overcome. For those who watched How I met Your Mother, \"Challenge Accepted!\"   The beef brisket was super tender and moist. It was just a simple bun with BBQ sauce and loads of tender, flake apart meat. I was already getting full after finishing the sandwich. And if the regular meat dosage wasn't enough they even have a double the meat add-on for $6. I can't even image how big that sandwich would look.  The pulled pork poutine was even bigger and about twice as big as the sandwich. Loads of pulled pork and I'm sure the meat to fries ratio was 40% meat, 60% fries. The only minuscule thing I could complain about is that there wasn't enough cheese curds.  I'm happy to say that I did eat everything on my own. I did have take a breather in between and took half the poutine home. Right when I got home within 10 minutes I promise you I did finish the rest. I was uncomfortably full and itus kicked in right away so I had to take a 5 minute power nap.   Excellent food, excellent service, affordable prices, amazing portions, lots of parking and plus its close to my work.  Solid 4.5 stars - Can't wait to take on the $39 combo they have which is meant to feed 2-3 people according to the menu."}
{"text":"Recently went back again as it was so good the first time.  Ordered the fried chicken again, however this time the larger piece was completely raw on the inside, husband had to spit it out and was thoroughly disgusted.  We brought it to the attention of the manager but he did not seem too worried about it and didn't offer to make it right, that was a bit off-putting."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem on yelp! It's tucked away beside pickering go train station, and quite busy for an extreme cold alert Thursday evening. Throughout the time that we are here, there's always people coming in and going out for dine-in and take-out.   I loved my pulled pork extreme poutine. Asked for no cheese and extra gravy so my customization really can't be called poutine! The portion is huge for the price. I barely finished a quarter and took the rest to go. There's a huge serving of pulled pork, and the spicy BBQ sauce made it phenomenal!  There's one staff working during the evening, and he was the most friendly person ever! We promised we will come by again next time to try the chicken wings and ribs. I can't wait!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the service was fantastic! The portions were huge, food was fresh and full of flavour and the prices were more than reasonable. Cannot wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"If you have been to numerous Ribfests in the area and probably seen Horn Dawgs in quite a few of them.   I always enjoy BBQs from Horn Dawgs. If you are like me kind of sick and tired of GTA's long and cold winter and dreaming about all those smell of meat at Rib Fests? Then dream no more because you can get those smokey piece of meat any time of the year.  Horn Dawgs' menu is more extensive here than what they offers at the ribfest. And they also have specials during the week or you can get a combo.  BBQ year round with no long line up!  Definitely worth coming if you are in the area for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Good food nice owner. Try an extreme poutine. Small eating area so better to take out."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Nothing else like it around with this quality. The man that works there with the European accent is really nice and you can tell he puts a lot of love in the food. He genuinely wants to customers to be satisfied.  The food portions are huge.  I got the brisket poutine.  Super solid choice. I've had the fried chicken, wings, pulled pork as well. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"In the middle of heavy snow from my friends house at Richmond Hill we decided to meet up at this little place in Pickering just so we can try out what a rib fest contender does outside the rib fest.  Pinned close to the Pickering Go station in a very unassuming plaza that is hard to find during heavy snow conditions we had found it, and just in time for us to get the last few orders in of the day since they close at 7pm.  We're happy they were gracious enough to let us stay past closing hours since we arrived there around 6:30ish due to the slow traffic.  The ribs didn't disappoint.  I was munching on them like I would at the rib fest.  Though it is still not the winner for me when it comes to ribs during the rib fest (that title goes to Tennessee Fatbacks BBQ) during the rest of the year this place will be my choice.  It is definitely worth the drive there as the quality just blows Outback and Montana's away (and a closer drive than Tennessee).  As a plus, they also serve Dad's Root Beer (possibly the world's best root beer that you don't make yourself) out of a bottle.  Next time I come here after my diet, I will bring at least three friends as two is not enough to try out the variety of food they have."}
