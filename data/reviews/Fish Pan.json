{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant, upstairs from the take away. The staff were wonderful, made sure my kids had colouring to do while we decided on what to have, and even moved us to a window table when it came free, so that they could enjoy the view. The food was piping hot, large servings, and absolutely delicious. My kids really enjoyed their desserts as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The chips were spot on my most recent visit. Haven't had any as good since. When I lived in Scarborough years ago I always found them a bit hit and miss so good to see they have upped their standard."}
{"text":"Visiting the seaside for the day. We popped in just for something to eat, 2 kids & 2 adults. It was very busy so we were downstairs near the door. It's nothing to look at from the street really but the food on offer was really good with ample portions washed down with pots of tea. Importantly the kids enjoyed what they had and would be happy ro go back next time we visit Scarborough. The staff were helpful and the service quick for the number if orders being sent to the kitchen."}
{"text":"The most authentic fish and chips you're find is here in Scarborough! Just FYI-their food is cooked in beef oil but they were kind enough to notify us before we got there. Staff was exceptionally accommodating- the best pair was the cod and chips with a Peroni! And seasoning with the spices is essential. Loved this spot- try to snag a view by the window- it's gorgeous!"}
