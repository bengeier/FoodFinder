{"text":"My bf and I were looking for a place to eat in his area on Saturday night and a friend recommended this place.

The restaurant itself was cute with a heated smoking area which I imagine is a terrace in summer, a bar in front a large seating area with dark wood-coloured tables. It was relatively full on a Saturday night at about 8:30pm with a mix of younger couples, older couples, families and groups of ladies. We arrived without reservations but were seated immediately by a silent host who led us to a tiny table in back. 

Our waiter explained the menu and the specials in GREAT detail and made recommendations. The wine menu was decent and well-priced.

We both chose the vegetable soup and contre-filet from the table d'hote menu. 

The vegetable soup arrived as a white-ish creamy slop surrounded by red grease that wouldn't homogeneously mix no matter how much I stirred it. It tasted better than it looked but that's really not saying much. 

The main dish smelled appetizing enough although the plate was VERY busy with various vegetables and garnishes and doused with dijonnaise sause which made it difficult to tell exactly what you were eating and where things began/ended on the plate. 

I had asked for my meat medium-rare and it was perfectly so....but it was more a tangle of nerves and muscle than meat. It was impossible to cut through and I ended up leaving most of it on my plate. 

Our waiter came to our table with a dessert plate and asked if we'd like to select anything. I noticed a selection of pastries but I was a little miffed from my poor food and not in the mood for anything.

We had coffee....both the espresso and drip coffees were decidedly foul. 

Our waiter was very sweet and seemed to loosen up and joke around as the night went on. He was, however, either wilfully or honestly clueless as he cleared away our full dinner plates and didn't ask if anything was wrong. 

It wasn't exactly cheap either and for what we paid we could have had a much better meal elsewhere. 

My bf and I are both Italian citizens and agreed that it was quite a bit of a stretch for the restaurant to claim itself  'Italian\"."}

{"text":"i was gonna say probably the best restaurant in Mascouche....but it's actually the best restaurant in Mascouche...i went there back in 2013 we were 2 persons ...it can get pricy.
the waiter recommended a great bottle of wine....that i had to mark the name down...
we had an appetizer and a main dish each plus a bottle of wine....total 225$...
i don't understand how a restaurant of this caliber can survive this far out of the city....
very popular in the summer judging by the many cars parked outside....
do i recommend it ? sure if you are near and looking for a nice place to eat."}
