{"text":"Hot fresh food pleasant staff quick service made our dinner enjoyable. We will be making this a regular stop when we're out."}
{"text":"For the money, the best burger on this side of town.  Worth the ride from anywhere in the Northwest valley.  Large flame broiled burger patties for a good price.  I am almost always pleased when I go here.  One exception was on a Sunday when I ordered \"tomato only\".  When I got home it had everything but tomato.  Must have be a dyslexic cook that day.  Recently remodeled and does feel nicer and cleaner.  On cooler days you can sit at a table just outside and watch the world go by."}
{"text":"I really didn't think this place was anything special. Their burgers taste like a Burger King burger. Everything was good, but nothing stood out as amazing or above average. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but if I was in the neighborhood and hungry I might stop by again. For Sun City, this is definitely an amazing place because there is NO good food in that town!"}
{"text":"The food is made fresh just for you and you definitely feel like a valued customer!  Staff is always incredibly helpful and friendly, in fact they are always looking for a way to go the extra step to make your experience the best it can be."}
{"text":"First time there was pretty awesome. Went there with my kid around 8 p.m. and the food came out Fast and Fresh. More like a mom and pop shop so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Benny's is a good place to go for a burger. I tried the Italian Beef and it wasn't exceptional, only good, the beef seemed old. I tried the chicken wings 3 of 5 stars, the fryer grease tasted old that night. The fries were hot but not crispy (old fryer grease) and a frozen potato product. I gave 4 stars for the friendly staff and  decent fresh burgers.
I haven't tried the BBQ. I couldn't see any evidence that they were doing any smoking of meats. I had a Korean Taco Special which was plentiful and tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered a strawberry shake from here and I gotta say it was delicious. I will come back here again! :D"}
{"text":"my first time there today!!! 

omg best hamburger i've ever eaten.. i had a mexican burger combo....great flavor, great service 

i am definitely going back as often as possible"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mexican Burger Combo after asking the cashier what was in the burger: pepper jack cheese, American cheese, grilled onions, and grilled green chiles.  I asked to have fried zucchini instead of French fries with my combo. She said yes, but didn't tell me she was charging me $.60 extra. 

My burger arrived with no green chiles. The cashier took my burger back and had the cook put grilled chiles on my burger. It came back with one piece of chile covering half of the burger. I then noticed there was no pepper jack cheese on my burger. 
The zucchini was from frozen and not fresh, but tasted okay. 
A positive note---they serve Coca Cola."}
{"text":"Bennys is like a old girlfriend, we've been through the best and the worst together. To start the best is food how the menu is so far and beyond anything around. But I have had hit or miss occasions and I've heard horror stories and glory stories so until consistency pervales  good luck"}
{"text":"Great variety, great specials, long line to get in, small seating area, inside and out, lots of togo orders."}
{"text":"Overpriced. The ribs were not good at all, couldn't tell if I was eating meat or fat. The pulled pork sandwich  was low quality ad well. The fried mushrooms and fries would be the best part of the meal. I would avoid if you want good bbq ."}
{"text":"Today was my first time in this place - burger was awesome!  So I took spouse back in during evening hour for the all you can eat fish.  Slaw was outa sight good.  Fries were crispy & fresh.  The fish was good but tasted as though it was frozen, not fresh.  It was good but not a Wow.  

It was crowded & busy.  The gentleman, I assume he was the owner, made sure he spoke to each and every person in the place.  It was pouring down rain....he & his awesome staff went above and beyond to make everyone comfortable and safe.  I am somewhat handicapped & he was genuinely concerned about my welfare, we appreciated that.  The parking lot really sucks, hard to get into & out and double whammed by the flood from the rain.    But you gotta try this place!  Awesome place to eat and very reasonable."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this place for some time now,.. sorry we didn't try them sooner!
Excellent burger and fries, both very tasty.. Burger was cooked more on the done side and seasonings gave it great flavor,  ...Fries were cooked and seasoned perfectly....
We will definitely be back for more...."}
{"text":"I am a RAVING FAN of this restaurant. Their food is so great I had them cater my 60th birthday party. Delicious wings, ribs, buttered rolls and cole slaw with an asian bite to it. The owner John is a great guy that will do anything for you. He loaned me some racks to hold the food and the sterno burners to keep the food warm. Very reasonable prices. You really should try their Italian sausage sandwich, Italian beef, Its all good. Five stars for Benny's Burgers and BBQ."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is good and inexpensive. The people who work there are very friendly."}
{"text":"Great little place to enjoy a great burger and drink. Friendly service. A decent menu with a variety of items to enjoy. The food arrived quickly and was hot and ready to eat. The staff was friendly and you can easily note the great customer relationship. The server knew a few customers by name. Highly recommend enjoying some grub here."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a snack and was immediately greeted with a huge smile and an impressive menu! After studying the menu for a really long time, I decided on the hot dog, onion rings, and I really wanted to try the ribs. Not wanting to purchase a full order, I asked if I could purchase just one- to see if I liked it. My answer was, yes! By the way, I will be back- the rib was fantastic! The hotdog was loaded Chicago style on a seeded bun. This place is awesome! The smile, the menu, and the great food are all reasons to go back!"}
{"text":"Been here before and Bennys always delivers great service and food. 
Brought my nephew here for the first time and he had the double burger with bacon and cheese. He was more than pleased, he loved his burger and said it was one of best he's had.  
Bennys is a great place because of the service as well as the food. We'll definitely be back for more delicious food."}
{"text":"So went to Benny's Burgers for the 1st time just because its right down the street from me and the wife wanted to try it out. 

We both got the pulled pork sandwich, it was kinda greasy but good. The frys were ok and my son liked his burger. 

The DB behind the counter on the other hand acted like he wanted to get my fist down his throat!!! He was dressed like \"The situation\" and had the hair of \"Pauly D\". He is lucky my fam was there or he would have gotten the beating of a life time!! 

Prob will go in again to try something else on the menu and to see if DB wants to rumble!!! (family not included)"}
{"text":"Great food. They have a good variety of items on their menu and their cheese curds are awesome! Service is great and every time we come here we never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Great burgers & fries
Better than any fast food burger & fries, anywhere
Pricing is good, people are nice, service is quick for made to order.

THANX"}
{"text":"The owner is great! He made my meal special order.   Service was friendly and quick!  It might not look like much from the outside but it's worth a stop to try.  You will be back!"}
{"text":"Korean steak tacos, the bomb... Pot stickers, sooo good. They have a great variety... Hot dogs, burgers, wings, desserts, salads and ribs! Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Awesome little family owned restaurant! Loved seeing this amidst all the other chain restaurants in the area. We've been a couple of times now and every they make is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  From the outside it looks like a place I probably would not eat t.  One burger and fries and I'm in love!!  I would not bother eating a burger anywhere else.  I would just wind up being sad that it was not a Benny's burger!!!  Go once and be hooked!  They also have a lot of different stuff on their menu, I've never been willing to forgo the burger!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a Burger or even Brisket!! We stopped on our way home and Benny himself was there and gave us top notch service! I had the Mexican Burger! It was perfection. Nothing fancy. Just great food!"}
{"text":"I like the staff and they have a solid burger and chocolate shake.  Their grilled chicken sandwhich and chicken strips are okay.  I have tried almost everything else on the menue and didn't really like anything else.  Stick with the Burger.  I go with Thousand Island as the sauce.  The place could use a face lift."}
{"text":"We were hungry and in the area so we decided to check this place out.  I mean you cant really go wrong with a burger.  The service was quick and friendly.  My burger was good.  Nothing special but good.  Same with the chili cheese fries.   
If for some reason I'm in the area again i would be willing to return and try the BBQ."}
{"text":"Yelp led us to this place. I knew we chose wisely when we walked in and there was a big table of retirees finishing up. The owner treated them like gold and they all said \"see ya next week\". That's a good sign. While we were trying to decide, he asked if we liked spicy burgers and gave us a sample of what they put on it. We all enjoyed our food and the owners relationship w/his customers."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a great price! I love this place. Not to mention the staff is very friendly. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"John the owner is the best!  Always friendly, anxious to please and will try to accommodate any dietary restrictions.  Best burgers ever, crisp fries, pulled pork is terrific.  He's just added calamari and makes his own dipping sauce.  I love it.  Our favorite whether eating in or takeout.  Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"This place makes great burgers. Love their Mexican burger with crispy fries and a milk shake. Good place for a fast food Friday night dinner"}
{"text":"Had been looking for some good charbroiled burgers for a while. And this my far has been really good. I also tried the Korean tacos; not too shabby"}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood so we want to search out all the independents. We saw the reviews and knew this had to be one of the first stops.

To be honest, I don't understand the reviews. 

The place is small but had a steady stream of customers. We took a table but had to move as the smell of the trash was overwhelming. Which explained why those tables were the only ones open.

Then the flies.  I understand it was a warm December day but propping open the door just lets in flies. I kept swatting them away waiting for our food, deciding if the food was that good, we'd just do takeout the next time.

I ordered the Hawaiian chicken sandwich combo and my hubs got the pulled pork. They brought out the sandwiches first as the fries weren't ready. Mine came in a plastic basket. His was just wrapped to go. No basket. Then my fries came out. Then finally his. Timing apparently isn't everything.

My sandwich was.....really not all that great.  The chicken breast was pressed to about 1/4\" thick and overcooked. The bacon was burnt black from the flat grill with a press on it. Both bun halves were burnt black.  Not grilled to toast.  burnt. I spent enough years as a cook in mom's restaurant to know the difference.  The fries.....came in a paper boat that had traces of something else in it probably from handling other foods. And they use some off-brand ketchup that was sour to taste. I was not a happy diner.

My hubs didn't fare much better. His pulled pork was moist but bland, he couldn't taste a good rub or smoke. It came with a bit of sauce. He did ask for more sauce and they gave him some which wasn't bad along with some Chicago neon relish. He ordered the sweet potato fries and they were the run-of-the-mill fries. His bun was burnt as well so maybe that's the standard

I debated going two stars but the place was busy. Maybe we hit a bad day. I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. But in this day and age when there are loads of burger joints to choose from, we will keep looking."}
{"text":"Still wonderful!   Fresh burgers.  Tasty.   Friendly staff.   Clean.   This place is well run. And the burgers are about ten million times better than McDonald's across the street!  McDonald's burgers taste like they cooked the meat last week."}
{"text":"well, I have only went there once, and since it is close to work I will try one more time. The pulled pork sandwiches might of been good, if they weren't left overs from yesterday. But the service is excellent, and I am hoping it was just a case of them making way too much meat for the Sunday crowd."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The Italian sausage sandwich is very good. Thumbs up from our entire lunch party."}
{"text":"Average at best. Seems like they are playing off the name of another burger shop with a great name. Service was good and the fries were the bright spot of the meal but I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and definitely don't regret it. Very delicious food for a good price and AMAZING service. Everyone is very nice!"}
{"text":"Guacamole bacon jalapeño burger with mango salsa... tickles my tongue just thinking about it. Chili cheese fries are a guilty pleasure.  Been here a few times and they always have something different on the menu.  It's very clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  Love supporting local businesses!"}
{"text":"Very good food here. I had the pulled chicken sandwich which was the special for the day. The bbq sauce had a good amount of spice to it and the food was hot and fresh. I'll certainly stop again if in the area but won't go across town to eat here. If you are close by, I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Staff was polite but looked like they had been working hard all day.   

Place is old I had the ribs which was 'ok', and wings.  Wings were good!

They do all you can eat fish fridays and all you can eat ribs on sundays."}
{"text":"This little place in  Sun City is as good as it gets if you grew up in a non-chain fast food era. It is all about homemade and handmade food, and the customer service is always friendly and accommodating. In decent weather, you can even sit outside and make as big a mess as you have to with their great food. For casual, familiar, and pure enjoyment -- this is the place."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little neighborhood place! I didn't have a burger but the ribs were great. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich and raved about it. He heard about this place from a friend so we thought we'd try it. Great decision! We will be back for sure. The peanut butter shake is yummy too!

Prices are reasonable. I was really impressed with the staff. They all are friendly and social. Plus they work together as a team. Even the owner came out and gave us a to go box. Can't wait to tell my friends about this restaurant. It was crazy to me how busy they were considering location but I understand why now."}
{"text":"I have passed it many times and finally stopped in. Greeted by a friendly employee behind the counter who suggested that I try the Burger of the Day. Spicy Mango Guacamole Bacon Cheeseburger. Combo meal ran around $9.50 for a real great tasting burger and decent fries plus a drink. Very clean on the inside and while I was eating lunch it became pretty busy quick. Will be back to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is always my favorite! I love it so much, I use to always come here after school when I was super young (: they have the best burgers! I think I even like it better than In&Out"}
{"text":"We were looking for a burger place and saw the reviews on yelp! We both had a burger and fries. The burgers are made to order and delicious. Benny's also has fish, ribs and other delicious foods on the menu. So glad we stopped. Friendly staff, clean, good food and great prices what more can you ask for.  Oh and family owned and operated so you are supporting local business."}
{"text":"Good food,great service,fair prices. I really like the Italian sausage with peppers and onions,of course you can't go wrong with the Chicago Dog"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to eat here 10 minutes before they closed and the owner kindly let us come in and eat. He had great customer service. He recomendad us the spicy bacon mango burger and the Chicago hotdog both were really good but we personally preferred the burger it was really tasty. You couldn't taste the mango in it too much which was perfect for us. Next time we plan on trying the polish hotdog which I think is the one with grilled onions on top. That one looked really good. I recommend people to come eat here if you're craving a different style burger or hotdog."}
{"text":"In Peoria for the weekend from KY. Benny's was suggested by resort staff member. WOW what a delight. I had the Mexican burger and it was delicious. My GF had Korean tacos and they were equally delicious. Great little restaurant with very affordable prices. Benny's would be a weekly dining option if I lived here."}
{"text":"Great ribs. 
Customer service is impeccable. 
Very friendly and happy Staff and owner ran. 
Been here couple of times always impressed and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Great burgers and awesome customer service! Very friendly staff. Cleared our food, refilled our ketchup, asked us how we were doing, and gave my 13 month old son a free cup of ice cream. I recommend over other fast food chains."}
{"text":"Was looking for something cheap and easy for dinner. I found it! Ordered a Brisket Sandwich for dinner. Came in 15 minutes later, and got it! Food was good (bit oversauced, but not terribly so!) and the fries were delicious. They gave a 64 oz to go cup, and told me that I could have any size I wanted with the combo so they just gave me the biggest! The two girls working were courteous and made me feel welcome! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden local hot spot. The beef brisket sandwich was moist with the right amount of barbecue sauce and the Hawaiian chicken sandwich was delicious and something with a different taste. Definitely recommend for local BBQ"}
{"text":"We stopped and ate here for the first time.  What a great experience.  The gentleman waiting on us did everything he could to accommodate my husband's need for a low sodium meal.  He even went back in the kitchen and personally prepared his food.  

And, the meal was delicious.  Plus, the cafe was very clean, as we're the rest rooms.  What we could see of the kitchen area was also tidy, organized and clean.  

Seldom do you find this type of service in a small cafe, but it was clear that the current management wants to be know as a reasonable, tasty and accommodating place to grab a quick bite.  They smoke all their Bar-B-Q meats right there.   We will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"Great service. The staff was friendly and helpful. Quickly offering and bringing a high chair to our table. Food was delicious. They even brought small condiments cups filled with ice cream for our children."}
{"text":"My best friend invited me here for lunch. I looked them up on yelp and was excited to try it out. I walked inside the restaurant and the energy and environment was very friendly ! 
 A gentleman greeted me and my best friend and he had a great personality. I told him I wanted something healthy and he referrers me to the Korean steak tacos. He had great humor and a awesome personality. 
  Overall this place produces high quality food at a very reasonable price! And the environment and energy is very friendly. If you need a quick bite come here you'll love it"}
{"text":"I started coming to Benny's for lunch a few weeks ago and now I'm a solid regular. It's by far the best burger place around and has spectacular variety. They have calamari and fried fish to spicy mango bacon burgers to enchiladas. And they're all amazing. Today I went in and talked to the owner/chef who was super cool and I got a pastrami burger with jalapeños, a side of fried cheese curds, and some fried pickles. It was so good I had to write a review (which is rare for me considering how much I go out to eat). Check it out! Even if you don't like the weird stuff on their menu, the regular burger is still amazing."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by the Burger I had. I could tell they have not cleaned the flattop grill the cook the burgers on in a while. It was overcooked, which only made the burnt taste it had even worse.  Fries were good, and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Upgrading this place to a 5 star after having their hamburgers. This place is clean, the staff is friendly and it's what you expect from a place like this. I would highly recommend getting one of their burgers. The chicken tacos are amazing as well as the wings."}
{"text":"This burger shop is great. Since the new owners have taken over they have expanded the menu. The mango guacamole burger is excellent as well as the fried pickles. 
The service is always good and the food always comes out hot!"}
{"text":"This place is good. The owner and staff are friendly and the food is always consistent."}
{"text":"Ordered a roastbeef sandwich and got a philly beef steak and took it back and waited another 10min for them to remake the same sandwich I had returned...Never again will I go here till you have robots who work for you."}
{"text":"It's not the best burgers but they were ok. No matter what order of fries you get they are going to come out small. Ok customer service."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. We were heading back home from a road trip and thought we'd give it a try. Super yummy and great friendly service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hard to beat the burgers and wings here. I have been here many times haven't found something I didn't like!"}
{"text":"Into the twilight zone once again!!  I have written a review in the past, but noticed it was nowhere to be found! So after finding it on one of my list, there are two Benny's links? Guess this place in under new management, so yelp allowed them to start over. Like I have said on the other reviews, never had a problem with this place. Wife loves their country burger, reminds her of the Douglas Burgers in SoCal. I have always tried different items on their menu never being disappointed. I have had their burgers, Italian beef,  pull pork, and much more. Great place, will be back again, but not during lunch hour on the weekdays. Very busy!"}
{"text":"Burgers are big with fresh veggies. Good flavor and made to order.  Nice hardy fries.  Clean and employees are friendly.   

Don't sit under the TV it will feel like everyone is staring at you."}
{"text":"Ohh yeah.  Great place to get your grub on.   Just talk to Benny.   He will hook you up.   Try it for your self."}
{"text":"I made a quick stop here to get some lunch and talk to the owner/manager. Unfortunately the manager was really rude. Opted to not have lunch there and won't bother to go back with all of the other reviews."}
{"text":"Contrary to the last poster....the sign in the picture clearly says \"Bennys\".  It was prob changed w/ the new ownership.  Based on the review on Blogger from the Arizona Burger Blog...this burger was rated well!  Here is the link:  http://azburgerblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/bennys-burgers-bbq.html


They also have Online Ordering!  Great for local business people that are time strapped and want their order ready when they arrive or for take out!

This owner also knows a thing or two about good eats!  I know from experience!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Fast service good food! 
Found this place while visiting and stopped by! 
Clean bathrooms too!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for burgers, fries, and milkshakes. The owner is always friendly. Outdoor seating is dog friendly, too!"}
{"text":"The employees that work here are very nice, friendly and helpful. However, the minute you walk in the door, you are hit with the over-powering stench of deep-fryers. Clearly a sign of poor air circulation. If you dine-in, expect to smell like you were working the fryers until you change your clothes.

The burgers are flame broiled and similar in size, shape, smell and taste to a Burger King Whopper. Even the bun is the same.

Nothing appears to be made 'fresh' here. Frozen fries, frozen this, frozen that. It's a small kitchen and a big menu. The food isn't bad, but it's not anything special. 

Had the wings. Was happy they served celery with the order. The wings were okay. I've had worse and I've had better.

Fries taste like they come from a generic bag of frozen fries.

It just seems to me that they order bulk frozen foods and 'cook'/'heat' them to serve. It doesn't appear they actually MAKE anything unique that you can't find at any other greasy spoon style restaurant.

This is not meant as an insult, but clearly as an honest observation. As I write this, the Yelp review is an average of 4 stars. I don't get it. I don't think people realize the potential harm they cause to a business when they give it 5 stars and set unrealistic expectations to new diners. There is no way this a 5-star restaurant unless the scale goes to 15 or you've never dined in an atmospheric restaurant with fresh, locally sourced, hand crafted specialties with excellent table-side service, easy parking and reasonable prices. At least, that's how I determine my ratings. I don't simply hand out 5-stars because the employees were nice and I didn't get food poisoning! But, based on the other reviews written here, I guess I'm the weird one. You decide.

Bottom line - Not terrible. Not great. And for the rest of your remaining day, you'll reek like a deep fryer after you eat here."}
{"text":"I have had Bennys 2 x once today and once about a year ago. 

Last  I had a burger and frys. It is your typical flamed grilled burger with whatever you want on it. Think of Lennys perhaps, not bad but nothing stood out either. 

Today I had the brisket. I am not 100% sure it was brisket but what it was was good. Again nothing to write home about but nothing bad either. It was thinly sliced beef served on a buttered and toasted bun with bbq sauce on the meat. 

Service was great, the place was clean. I would go back but will not crave it."}
{"text":"Visited this place after seeing they offer flounder fish, my favorite. The place is old looking and the inside smells of old nasty cooking grease, really needs to be updated and a thorough cleaning. The flounder was horrible, nasty tasting, no fish taste at all only the breading and mush, no structure to the fish at all. Will not return unless the place does a complete clean or remodel."}
{"text":"Cute place.  Italian Beef sandwich was not very good though."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The double bacon cheeseburgers are the best burgers in the west valley but the Korean tacos are FLAT OUT AMAZING!!
Seriously.  Order them and add some extra sriracha and be prepared for something you'd never expect from a burger joint"}
{"text":"Mexican burger was fantastic! Food came out very fast. Overall, excellent lunch at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Not real busy, very clean and everything is made to order, nothing pre-made.
No Drive-in, orders brought to your table.
We got there about 11:30 a.m. and a.m. I glad we did, it got extremely busy around noon, but no one waited long for there orders.
Chicken strips and cheeseburger were very good.
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, always welcoming, letting you choose the size of your combo drink for the same price, and great fries and burgers! Always happy with this place."}
{"text":"I don't get up to this part of the valley much, but when I do this place will be on the lunch short list.
If you have a hankering for a good burger hit up this place. BBQ is not bad but Burgers R Us best fits this place.
Staff and owner are friendly and seem to appreciate your business.
Food is fresh and cooked to order Yea Baby!
Only fault I could find is parking. Like any good lunch place it's busy around noon and you might have to get creative when parking."}
{"text":"This restaurant may not look like much, but it definitely is! The food is great. I had a burger & fries which tasted very fresh. The customer service was AMAZING! The gentleman putting the orders together was very friendly. He was even willing to make food accommodations for my son. Great food and great customer service is my kind of place! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the charbroiled cheese burger specials I use to eat IN L.A.  with them yellow peppers.. Mmm so good!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the food. Love the service. Love the older gentleman at the counter. It's nice to see people be passionate about their business."}
{"text":"wow, the best burger i've ever had from a take out style place!

was in the mood for a burger and finally decided to give this place a try.  Stopped in about 7:30 and ordered 2 cheese burgers and some chilli cheese fries.  while waiting for my food the owner came out to say hi and we talked for a bit about BBQ and Smoking Meats.  he gave me a taste of the beef brisket and i will be ordering that next time i go in, the meat was amazing and the sauce was VERY flavorful.

The burgers were also amazing.  the quality of meat this place uses is awesome, not what is expected for a takeout style place and for the price (very inexpensive).  The mayo sauce is made in house and also very tasty too, these guys know how to BBQ!

I can't wait to go back and try some different menu items, i'm glad i decided to finally stop in!"}
{"text":"Still 5 stars. Got a hot dog for the first time and it changed my life. If you like Chicago dogs, try it Polish style. So good!"}
{"text":"I liked the Korean BBQ dinner special. Come here for the food, not the ambiance."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to try it for lunch after checking the reviews, I was surprised, it was a pretty damn good burger, love the large fries  
I went to this place years ago & wasn't that good, never went back, glad I gave it another shot, must be new ownership."}
{"text":"I love this! Theres somthing about a place that does certain things and does them right without trying to be fancy about everything. You want a burger you get a great burger, you want some great chicken wings they got them here to, and for a great price. Its a place you can always go back to. My wife and I have been here 3 or 4 times and the owner knows what we like and how we like it and it seems he is like that with everyone. Once you go you wont regret it. Its everything you want in a restaurant. Its not a chain so get your tounge ready for some real food."}
{"text":"To start, this place has amazing customer service. But after that you have great fries, onion rings, and shakes. 

I have yet to expand into the real menu, but so far with what I've tried the food is good and the mom and pop service makes me smile and want to come back.

I only wish that they were open later."}
{"text":"Simply the best !!!! Period ! If u want a burger this is the only place ! We have been customers for years but had stopped going cuz the help sucked ! Especially the grouchy old lady ! Now under new management we have to pace ourselves to only once per week ! The owner is often there & such a nice friendly person. Who cares that u r there !"}
{"text":"First time going to Benny's and I ordered the Mexican Burger double Jack Cheese no American and OH MY GOODNESS!!!!  So delicious!!!  My husband had the Double Classic and it was yummy as well!!  Their french fries were good.  The people that waited on us were so friendly and very helpful when asking questions about the menu.  I will support this local business and look forward to going back, that Fish Sandwich is calling my name!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE on the FRIED PICKLES:  Paid something like $3.49 for fried pickles.  Well, I expected a small basket of them like everyone else serves, but no! Benny's Burgers took one small to medium sized pickle, fried it in batter and served it--for $3.49 or close to that price!  What a rip-off!!!!

I put up with your lousy ventilation, Benny, for the cheap prices and okay food, but being ripped off totally for your skimpy sized fried pickles is too much.  I am never coming back, cause I have run out of making excuses for leaving your establishment reeking of greasy smell...and now rip-off servings.  I think not."}
{"text":"I put \"burgers\" in my GPS and randomly picked a location nearby. I am happy that I ended up at Benny's. My husband got the triple burger and he said it was delicious. My pulled pork sandwich was really good! We will be back to Benny's for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little neighborhood burger joint. The food is really tasty, competitively priced and comes out in a hurry. They also have daily specials which make an already good burger a little more special. Their fries are cooked perfectly! Not those mushy, barely fried fries. These are nice and crispy on the outside and perfect for dunking in catsup. 
The counter help are always very friendly and helpful. 
I'm glad this place is in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great Burgers!  Taste like you grilled them yourself in the back yard.  Friendly staff and your food is never made before you order!

YUMMMMMMM"}
{"text":"Yelp did it again! Never would have noticed this place without all of the amazing reviews.  So...the hardest part was what to try first!  I live a bit away from here and didn't want to waste my first visit, so....RIBS PLEASE!!

I got the sampler, thought I would just eat 3 ribs and fries then try their single patty burger.  NOPE!  Not the way it worked at all.  Those 3 ribs were so big and filling that not only did I not have any room for a burger, but that's all I needed for dinner and the rest of the night.  in 2 words FILLING, TENDER.

Now my hangup on fries, I love them crispy.  VERY crispy and everywhere I go I always ask for fries cooked well done...(about 10% of the time they actually come out like that after I ask) Well.... at Benny's you don't even have to ask.  They properly cook their fries from the start.  Food may take a few minutes longer than the \"Ronald McMoney\" scene but it's well worth it.

Friendly service
Great food cooked tender where it should be and crispy where it needs to be.
See you next time!!"}
{"text":"Well after church we wanted to grab a quick burger. Just seen Benny's out the corner of my eye an said wanna try it? So we turned. OMG it was the best thing i did!! I grew up goin to stores where you seen cows one day an the next day their gone an the store is full of fresh meat!! Sorry no pics of the food! I was a pig an the double with everything, seasoned fries, an a large banana shake  just didnt make it around long enough for a picture! They had to go!!!! Seen alot of good things on the menu i wanna try. Everything was fresh an the store was very clean. The workers were very nice!  Will be going back. Maybe a pic next time at check in!!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. The food was a solid 8 out of 10. I tried the pastrami burger and the chili cheese fries, my husband had a regular burger and fries. They use seasoning salt on the french fries which were nice and crispy. The cheese and chili are canned. The chili I can understand but I was kind of hoping for melted cheese. The place was packed!  The man at the counter was really friendly and helpful even bringing a small container of his guacamole mango salsa for me to try. The negatives are it smells greasy, like old grease, and I'm pretty sure our clothes will smell when we leave.  It was strong enough that we never got used to it, we continued to smell it throughout the entire lunch. It also doesn't appear to be very clean. The chairs backs are dirty looking and sticky. The tabletops and all the condiments had a sticky feel to them as well which could be from the amount of grease that is probably in the air."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have the best tacos I've ever had. They also have some amazing shakes. I would recommend the Korean tacos they had just the right amount of spice. The service is great and the wait was minimal."}
{"text":"This is a nice no frills sort of burger place. I got a double cheeseburger combo. Cheese was extra (70 cents more for mine) so my total was 10.30. I would say this is in the 5 guys category. The prices are better here but there aren't a bunch of add ons. It's a patty, lettuce, tomato, onion. You can add your condiments.

The fries were good, thick and crispy with some seasoned salt. They have a triple cheeseburger for 6.29 lol. I don't usually eat fries and soda so that might be an option if I'm hungry enough. 

The place was pretty busy and service was par with 5 guys. There are lots of other things available here but I reviewed it as a burger spot today.

Gotta give them props on the name though ;)"}
{"text":"Love Bennys it's just  down the street. Everything is fresh and made on the spot be sure to give them time to have everything prepared this is not a fast food in and out. They need time to do their magic. Also everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"Trying to figure out what all the good reviews were about... Meat was good, no complaints there. Chili and cheese were something like you would expect from a little league concession stand. Definitely not worth the money, I haven't visited since."}
{"text":"I ordered the Italian sandwich with fries.  Best sandwich I've had in a long time, very tasty.  Friends had the burgers and the said they were great!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Good food. Fast courteous service.  Very hospitable and just good food.  I had the Chicago polish dog to be 'different' but it was very good and the fries were yummy. Will come back to try out the menu with friends. :) not a lot of seating but we had no issues finding seats. Small place to grab a quick bite or stay a lil longer enjoying your meal or for take out."}
{"text":"This place has a little bit of everything, but the burgers rock.  Try the Mexican or the saracha  bacon mushroom burger.  Tried the spicy  Korean steak tacos and they weren't bad either.  Great place."}
{"text":"Benny's was recommended to us by a friend who's never led us astray. We tried it today and we're very pleased!!  I had the spicy mango guacamole bacon burger (that's a mouthful to say let alone eat) that was incredible!!  Not too spicy but every bit delicious!  I also indulged in the sweet potato fries and they were crispy-on-the-outside and soft on the inside perfect!  My husband had the Korean steak rice bowl which was \"just like mama used to make!\"  
Next time my husband has his eye on a Chicago style hot dog. Go to Benny's you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Benny's is a pretty decent little burger dive. I had the mango burger. It says spicy but it wasn't bad at all. Pretty good flavor. Good onion rings too. It was a good little place. I liked the char on the burger too. They were a bit skimpy on the sauces but the service was really good. The obvious owner or head manager was really cool. He suggested the Korean steak tacos, and I think I'll go back to try them out sometime. If they blow me away I'll definitely bump to 4 stars.

If it's a nice day I really liked their patio, the dining area indoors was pretty bland. But we were expecting much when we went. Decent price for what I got."}
{"text":"Holy crap!  Where has this place been all my life?   Really.  I'll put this place up against any chain in town.  Hand made and family owned.  This may even be worth a trip if you are not in the area.
Try 'em.  I think you'll agree."}
{"text":"Wow, what gem on the westside! Diverse menu with quality ingredients. Highly recommend the Korean Steak Tacos! My family enjoyed it and we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Didn't really care for bbq beef brisket sandwich. Fries are good though, wish dey had fry sauce for there fries."}
{"text":"Awesome food! JB recommended the spicy mango bacon avocado burger. I am so glad he did! It had just the right amount of spice and was oozing with the delicious sauce! The sweet potato fries were perfect! The mushroom burger was good too.  All were cooked fresh and worth the extra minute it took to prepare! We tasted the ice cream and now can't wait to go back for a shake! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Don't underestimate the power of being hungry !! It's reminiscent of times ago - but good taste !! If yr craving burgers & fries / bbq & onion rings --- stop on by!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! The food was great and the manager/employees were very polite and attentive!:)"}
{"text":"Burger was cold . The owner bought out fries then saw that we only got ordered two orders then took the extra back inside ! Was he gonna re serve them ? Scary"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and amazing customer service! It's rare to see business owners and employees go above and beyond to serve their customers. We definitely will be back again :)"}
{"text":"To add to my 2013 review...  I would still recommend this place! It definitely has that mom and pop feel. The owner is soo nice and makes sure we have everything we need.  The staff is always friendly. I love the pastrami burger and cheese fries! My hubby loves getting the triple country style with extra cheese and a fried egg. Once in a while they'll have seasonal specialty burgers like the guac mango bacon burger or items like fish tacos, so it keeps it exciting.  (I think they offer catering as well.) :) til next time Benny's..."}
{"text":"Nice hole in the wall restaurant. really good burgers and has some good ribs as well."}
{"text":"Really good bugers of many varieties! They use an old fashioned flat charbroiler which of course produces the absolute best burger flavor. They also have Teriyaki, Pastrami, Mexican, and many others. They also do a terrific Korean taco platter that is fantastic. Great BBQ including ribs and brisket, and fried flounder fish are some of the specialties. Home spun shakes also served here. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place has so much to offer. I can't believe I passed this placed for so many years to find it's actually amazing. The food was awesome and so many options"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly & inviting owner. Waitstaff is courteous. Customer Service orientated. Food freshly prepared. Fresh ingredients. Made to order. Cleanliness is top notch. The atmosphere very relaxed. Authentic, delicious hamburgers. Served anyway you like. Customizable to your preference. Ribs, Calamari, Pot Stickers, Salt & Pepper wings are amazing."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has 4 stars to begin with.  Friends doing reviews?  Anyway I would give it 2.5 stars.  My order was to go so I can't comment on how nice the owner is etc.  But hey we're here to talk about the food right?  We got ribs, wings, onion rings and zucchini sticks.
First the wings are not \"jumbo\" as they show on their website.  They are average size but totally lacking in flavor and quite dry.  We got bbq and honey mustard.  The honey mustard had no flavor.  I'm not even exaggerating.  
Anyway next the 1/2 rack of ribs.  About 3/4 of each rib was tender (not following of the bone tender but edible tender) and the flavor was just ok.  The last quarter was dry and not worth eating.  Zucchini sticks and onion rings were fine.
But i won't be going back again especially since we paid nearly $30 for this order.  Definitely not worth paying that much for food that lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Just stumbled over this place.
Had a double burger, couldn't finish it. Too big!
It was very good. Nice counter help.
I'll be back to try some other things they have. 
Fish fry, BBQ spare ribs, wings, hot dogs and salads. All that and more. I might rate it higher after I have checked out more of the food. 
This small place looks to be a winner!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Benny's for the first time tonight and loved it. We both had burgers. I had a Swiss, bacon and fried egg burger with fries and a Coke. Very tasty for both. Our new favorite burger joint. They also have BBQ brisket, brats, Italian beef, and so much more. We will be trying everything on the menu. Thankfully they serve Coke products. Comfort food at its finest."}
{"text":"Four stars because I've only tried the burgers here and not the BBQ or anything else on the menu. I went here today with my one year old son for lunch with my grandmother and the place was PACKED! We moved through the line pretty quickly but it stayed consistently busy. (This was at lunchtime. 12pm) the owner I'm guessing took our order and said we could choose any size drink we wanted and they would find us where ever we sat, to deliver our food. The burger was great and big for being a single and the fries were perfectly done. Some crispy but not over done. Over all this place was good but what really stood out to me was that in the midst of the busy rush of customers the owner took time to bring my son a child's size ice cream to our table free of charge. It's the little things like that, that make these kinds of restaurants great!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great,  super friendly. Dining area very clean, kitchen area very clean.  Fries were great,  thick cooked perfectly auth a touch if seasoning salt.  Hubby had double cheese,  double has good meat to bun ratio. Decent burger.  I got the bbq  pulled pork... It's was super good, bbq had sweet & tangy flavor.  Under $20.00 for both of us.  Definitely w worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, diverse menu, very clean, service was great!  Very friendly employees too!  I got the double hamburger combination, the burger was very good.  The fries were not as hot as I think they should have been. Otherwise, it would have been 5 stars.
We will come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and prepared quickly. The customer service was awesome. There is a nice casual cozy mom and pop feeling making it a nice place to stop."}
