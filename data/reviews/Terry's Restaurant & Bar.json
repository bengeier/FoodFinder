{"text":"What a great find! A relatively small and intimate neighborhood bar with fabulous food. This is exactly what some of the big boy \"neighborhood bars\" want to be but never will. 

We ordered the daily special sandwich and the Big Fat Greek Burger. Oh my, were they delicious? Absolutely. Was he big and fat? Undoubtedly. Was the smoked pork tenderloin smoked to perfection? Positively.
We're the fries on the burger combo crunchy outside and creamy inside? Perfectly.

And the price was outstandingly reasonable. I mean really! 

If I lived close I'd be hard pressed not to eat here every day. 

Don't miss out Terry's is a super winner."}
{"text":"This is a great place...this is our breakfast place every Sunday....the people are friendly....our waitress Michelle is great...the service is fantastic. My boyfriend loves the apple caramel pancakes! Everything we've tried has been very good!"}
{"text":"Quick breakfast and tea before studying at the nearby library. Tip: ask them to hold the salt if you prefer lighter taste."}
{"text":"Good food! Service staff are friendly. Price is right. I go mainly for breakfasts... Looking to try out their dinner soon :)"}
{"text":"An amazing gem hidden in Scarborough.
Terry's has been a staple of our weekends since the moment we first visited. Their food is phenomenal and the service is great. I have never been disappointed and will continue to eat here for years to come.
The chicken souvlaki dinner is amazing and the burgers are too!"}
{"text":"Coworkers had the veal parm lunch special and loved it.
I have been looking for a good burger in Scarborough and Terry's is the winner. 
Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic gyros and great service.  They state they are neighbourhood oriented place and it firmly shows.  I specifically asked if their gyros was from a rotating spit or frozen (zet's i'm looking at you) else I'd get the souvlaki and waitress was surprised anyone does that.  

I will come back and try the breakfast but I think I found new favourite spot for greek in the east end.

2nd visit.  I had the sweet and savoury waffle.  If you like chicken and waffles, you'll love this.  So full of flavour, you'll be feeling guilty.

Best brunch option in Scarborough IMO"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and arrived for breakfast. Amazing food with very reasonable prices. Our server was super nice and the whole place had a home kitchen atmosphere to it, it's one of the warmest and friendliest places I've ever been to. Definitely a place worthy of several visits."}
{"text":"Today I had the pleasure of visiting Terry's and meeting the master mind owner Demetre who is very pleasant and most certainly passionate about food and his wonderful restaurant. Although it was my first time there the place felt familiar and the staff made me feel like family,  oh boy was it ever an amazing find. 
It was my first time there and really hungry I order the recommended Chicken Pita Wrap Dinner for take-out, and by far the best wrap I have ever had truly a #1 choice. Savoury chicken all white meat, fresh toppings and an excellent hint of herbs n light garlic all wrapped up in the best tasting pita bread I have ever had (:
My Dinner also included French fries which were perfectly done and soo good accompanied by Heinz ketchup and an excellent Greek Salad with fresh lettuce tomatoes cucumbers olives and lots of yummy feta cheese with a very nice dressing. I felt the love as I bit into my wrap clean fresh subtle Flavor's and to my delight no over whelming garlic sauce taste (thank you)  excellent deserving if the sign in the restaurant that reads #1 chicken pita in Canada (; my salad was wonderful, and my French fries were almost all stolen by my staff back at my work (: lovely lunch Demetre thank you ever so kindly. I love your   Passion. See you soon with my staff this time."}
{"text":"Outstanding local restaurant.  We been having breakfast here for years and they never disappoint.  It's good fresh food at very inexpensive pricing with great service, even the cook says hi.    Main floor new bathrooms makes it easy for older customers."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Greek place!
Their pork souvlaki is amazing, and the salad is not your average salad that comes with your meal!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food we had burger, salad, pasta and gyro...all great, totally not expected from outside, great service too, price reasonable...."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast with friends today.  It is a nice bright space.  The service was excellent, and the breakfast was served hot.   Very tasty eggs, sausage and toast.  Coffee was good too.  I think this will be our new spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"Amazing food. 
Perfectly done.
Vintage bar feel, fast service. Got the big fat greek burger and the maman mia burger
Opa fries were great too"}
{"text":"Driving through scarbs for meetings and stopped for a Gyro here, takeout. It was one of the best I've had in a long time --suuuper greasy but freaking delicious. Like, thank god I had a stack of napkins in the car because it was soaked through the paper bag and running down my arm. Would probably cure hangovers well. 

Staff was friendly, prices reasonable, food came up fast. The ambiance is pretty standard bar/family restaurant vibe."}
{"text":"The service was really prompt and the food was good (aside from the coffee). We'd come back if we're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"What a find! I was out showing my family around Toronto when they desperately needed to get out the city. We drove west with really no plan and stumbled across Terry's due to its great yelp rating. The service was fast, FRIENDLY, and our food tasted great! Absolutely no complaints.

Next time i find myself is Scarborough and looking for a meal I will definitely remember the crew at Terry's!"}
{"text":"A delicious place to visit that has a home town feel to it . Consistent breakfast or dinners keep us coming back , that offer large portions.  Feels like the Greek restaurants I was used to in Winnipeg. The burgers are homemade , the souvlaki is delicious and the gyro's come with a large salad and fries , for a very reasonable price in the city . We keep trying other places but usually end up back here as it's consistent. The staff are very friendly but then again we have frequented it quite a bit so they know us . 4 and half stars ."}
{"text":"A great little place!! The food is so good and what I noticed was how fresh the ingredients were and that everything was made to order.  A GREAT place for students or those on a budget because the prices are so reasonable!! The service was friendly and quick. You can tell it's a family run place! The waitress was very caring and attentive! She offered to replace my friend's dish when she tried it and didn't like it. Definitely a place to visit when in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"Terry's is your typical \"Coney Island\" Greek family restaurant. Vicky our lovely server always does an amazing job helping us out. I have been going to this place for the past 5 years. The feel of the place is dated but really... Who cares? The kitchen is always willing to alter your order to accommodate any dietary needs. Awesome food with awesome service!"}
{"text":"Unlike most who have reviewed, I wasn't very impressed with my experience here. I ordered the breakfast platter which consisted of 2 pieces of bacon and sausage, one piece of ham, Texas toast and three eggs over easy with tasteless potatoes. Eggs were very good but bacon and sausage were ordinary. Service was subpar. Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Visiting from Kentucky..had the pleasure of being served by Vicki for lunch. The chicken pita combo was amazing and could go for two meals. I also recommend a having a spicy caesar..she'll put horseradish in it for you. If I ever return to Toronto, I will visit Terry's again."}
{"text":"Great customer service and has become one of my go to places because it's very close by. I recommend the sweet and salty, absolutely  delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday for brunch with my sister and her boyfriend and had a great experience. We walked in around noon and got to sit wherever we liked. Our waitress was lovely, service was great, and the food was delicious. Everyone enjoyed their meals and we would all like to return sometime.

I went with the Monte Cristo and every bite was filled with ooey gooey cheese, savoury ham and some added habanero heat. I asked for some hot sauce and our waitress offered Tabasco, Frank's, and then an in house made habanero hot sauce and I'm so glad she did. Easily one of the most delicious hot sauces I've ever tried! I wish I could buy a bottle of it to take home with me. Luckily I did get to take some home in a little container. I also enjoyed their home fries which were even more delicious with the sauce.

I will definitely come back to enjoy something else off of their menu and get another dose of habanero."}
{"text":"Terry's is a somewhat bar/industrial area type of food. I only had a take out, which was a massive portion, especially relative to the price. However I use the word industrial since the food wasn't excellent quality, and full of carbs. I think they should have reduced the carbs (rice in my case) and lower the price as well. Then offer extra carbs for those who need it. I would imagine a lot of food going to waste at this place. Also, the meat was dehydrated and seemed a bit old. The service was excellent. Although free WiFi would be nice."}
{"text":"Nice people. Very accommodating. Son had the \"Big Greek\" burger and raved. My hero was very very good. My wife had the Gyro dinner ands he loved it including the salad the cane with it. It was huge and very tasty. We all tried the Poutine for the first time. Although not my favorite, I was out voted. The other 3 in our party thought it was phenomenal. For me it was very well-made, just not my favorite texture combination. I guess I'm just not cut out for Poutine. Nice local place. I would definitely recommend eating at Terry's."}
{"text":"Loved the food absolutely amazing. Great service. Nice and clean restaurant and will be recommending it to all my friends"}
{"text":"I have been in Scarborough all my life and just recently discovered this hidden gem...
The service is amazing, the food is delicious and the price is very reasonable.
I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!!"}
{"text":"The Apple caramel pancakes are wonderfully dense. So good. The service is prompt, friendly and quick. The food came out fast and delicious. I'll be back for dinner. Yum"}
{"text":"My first time going to Terry's, I had takeout. After visiting, everything the reviews say here is true. In the short time interacting with the staff, not only are they friendly and provide amazing service, the food is AMAZING!!! You can tell they only use quality ingredients. I'm definitely coming in to dine here and I'm really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing hands down one of the best hidden gems in Scarborough. So far I've hade there soups, burgers, wraps and breakfast. Everything was perfect and the service is spot on my water was always full without any hesitation. I strongly recommend this place to everyone. They now have Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake OMG they have it all!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here because of the good reviews :-)
Server Vicki is very friendly and the service is good.
We have ordered breakfast specials and I have to say they make the best home fries in town - crispy outside and soft inside. Bacon is thick, firm and non-greasy. Over-easy eggs are just right.
would definitely come back !"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Place was rammed on a Saturday at 11am. 
My only complaint was the service. Table of 4 men who were sat after us got their food before us but had two of the same orders... and there was only two of us. Wasn't asked if I wanted a coffee refill until after the bill came and we had to hunt down a waitress.... there were 3 different ladies who served (or didn't serve us) and we had no idea who to talk to. Again it was busy but for some reason we seemed to be being ignored... I had to request things that are normally provided (ketchup, milk, sweeter,  more water/coffee). 
On the same note we both did enjoy the atmosphere, looks like a lot of regulars go every weekend and I will be returning. I got eggs Benny and my sister got the pancakes with apples and cinnimon. Yum."}
{"text":"Went because I wanted an all day breakfast menu! What I had read about parking was correct, it was absolutey atrocious! We got to the point where we were looking for somewhere else to go eat because we didn't think any parking would open up. But, we got a spot and went into the restuarant to find it almost empty! The food was delicous and the prices were good. Our waitress was averagely friendly and the service wasn't phenomenal for how empty the restaurant was, but overall it was a good place!"}
{"text":"I've never tried their lunch and dinner menu but it's most definitely a great place for brunch. They offer all-day breakfast but some items on the breakfast menu (including their popular eggs benedict) are even cheaper before 11am. Their eggs benedict is simply the best. Very nice and friendly service too."}
{"text":"It was 12:00pm on this bright and sunny Saturday morning. I was feeling great from an earlier outdoor cardio workout running up/down the stairs at the Scarborough civic centre . We called in for take out and got the 'High Protein Greek Style' (two grilled chicken breasts, two pork slouvaki sticks, gyro, and tzatziki with house lemon juice). It was listed under the \"Opa\" Creations of Greece section on the menu. We missed the breakfast deals so I'm like 'Me want protein!' Now this was around $25, however check out my pics. The meats were flavourful and seasoned well. Lemon wedges and cilantro/corriander garnished the dish. The meal came with a generous amount of tzatziki to get the job done. Although I had called-in/ordered a couple minutes before, and then showed up, my order wasn't ready cause it was really busy inside. One of the waitstaff invited me to have a seat at the bar, and poured me a cup of coffee. Exceptional service and hospitality. I will be paying another visit to try some other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Best all day breakfast place I've been to. Second time coming here and their 4 egg omelettes are delicious!!! This place is a must try. You won't be disappointed! Next time I'm going to give the lunch options a try"}
{"text":"This is a great find for several of us to meet for lunch.  Great food, healthy options!  The Greek salad is amazing!  The Chicken Pita is also really good.  I found Terry's on Yelp and have been there with friends twice this month.  There's parking out the back if the small lot out front is full.  Vicky our server both times is friendly , helpful & has a great sense of humour. We'll be going back soon"}
{"text":"Prior to hiking in Scarborough Bluffs, I felt it necessary to grab a hearty brunch at a local hotspot. After doing some research,  Terry's consistently topped the charts. Known especially for their Greek inspired meald, and overall large food quantities, I figured I had to give it a try.

I ended up ordering their BLT sandwich, which had a great amount of each ingredient (plenty of bacon which is always a good thing!). Came with a side of fries and a coleslaw salad, the salad was a bit on the oily side for my personal preference. My boyfriend ordered a breakfast meal, came with SIX sausages, homefries (probably among the best homefries I've ever tried) and he also got 3 eggs on the side. Eggs were cooked perfectly too! 

The overall feel in the restaurant isn't the best, I found it rather dark and a little outdated, but I guess you could call it cosy. Glad I tried it, as I had plenty of leftovers and the price was more than reasonable :)"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my sister for Mother's Day. It is a breakfast place, and the servers were extremely polite especially being so early in the morning!

Before 10AM, they have a breakfast special which consists of 3 eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast for $5.99. 

Before leaving, they gave my sister a flower since it was Mother's Day which I thought was a very kind gesture! 

Awesome breakfast food and top notch service."}
{"text":"I read all the good reviews and decided to check this place out finally for Pancakes yesterday before lent started.  First of all the staff there are incredible, friendly and the right amount of attentive, close by if you need anything. I had grand slam breakfast, my husband had wings and fries/gravy. The wings were fantastic and they make their own sauces in house, not just throwing on some bottle stuff.  My pancakes were great, best pancakes I have had in Toronto in as long as i can remember. So we were there at 7:30pm, and it was a great place to hang and unwind. 

I can't wait to go back again (thinking about it right now lol). Will definitely try out brunch with the gf's. This could be my new fav spot!"}
{"text":"Great little spot, amazing greek food and friendly waitresses. Greek dry rub wings and feta fries were absolutely amazing! 
Thanks for Christmas customer appreciation evening!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. We go here often for breakfast and sometimes pick up burgers. Yum!"}
{"text":"Based on the great Yelp reviews, I went for breakfast to Terry's Restaurant yesterday. Although it was almost 11am when I arrived, the place was still full, but I was able to sit at the bar where there were a few seats. It seems to be a fairly nice and clean diner with a bar near the kitchen, and seats maybe 40 people. There were 2 large tv's showing CP24 news, copies of the Toronto Sun for reading, and music playing in the background, plus it was pretty loud from so many customers. The service was a bit slow as expected when so busy, but I also found it to be a bit indifferent, nothing to complain about but not great.

As for the food, that was okay, but nothing particularly special. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with ham, which came with home fries, and a cup of coffee. I think the home fries were the best part, not at all salty as I read in other reviews. The menu is fairly standard for breakfast and diner foods: eggs and meat plates, waffles and pancakes, sandwiches, burgers, fish and chips. My bill was $13, so not bad. Overall, everything was okay, but nothing that would draw me back, although I may return in future at a less busy time to see if I fare better."}
{"text":"Tried their grand slam breakfast very good!  Wait staff are friendly and courteous.  Will come back for lunch next time."}
{"text":"We live near and have always just passed by. We finally dined for lunch and we were not disappointed at all. Prices and service are great! The burger was scrumptious and the waffle was to drool for. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Had the Italian omelet with homemade habanero sauce .. it had just enough heat that I could still taste my food .. home fries were nice and crunchy
."}
{"text":"Good service and decent food..ordered sweet and salty. You can choose between bacon or sausage. Pretty good but too much whip cream. Nice and quick breakfast place."}
{"text":"Great food!!! The décor isn't stellar, neither is the location ( I go there when I visit my mechanic). The serving size, quality, assortment, and value is definitely remarkable. Love the Greek fries, the wraps, gyro, and all the breakfast items!"}
{"text":"Tasty and filling breakfast specials for as low as $5.99 that come out lightening fast (at least on a Tuesday morning) and are available until 11am. A clean, comfortable place with a good humored waitress that is attentive but gives you space; you seat yourself and the menus are on the table. The front parking lot is tiny but there's more parking in the back. They're located next to TD bank near the corner of Ellesmere and Bellamy in the Ellesmere Professional Centre plaza. Solid breakfast place in Scarborough."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family and we enjoyed ourselves. Michelle was our waitress and she was sweet. She taught me   how to eat a gyro properly. We enjoyed all of our meals and everything was affordable. It is a nice local place for a cheap quick bite to eat. My mother ordered big fat greek burger which was amazing. I ordered the chicken pita which was also incredible. I highly recommend this local joint for some good humble eats in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Ordered the ribeye steak sandwich with fried onions and Monterey jack cheese with side Greek salad. My hubby ordered a Montreal smoked meat sandwich with light rye toasted and side coleslaw. My order was a huge portion. The steak was in slices that came with a foccacia type garlic bread and the Greek salad was one of the best I've had in a long time (had good proportion of tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, olives and feta cheese with a good amount of salad dressing ). I was hoping the ribeye steak was an actual steak on a bun type but I should have asked first.  The Montreal smoked meat was juicy, flavorful and a good portion. Would go back to try their all day breakfast and other items on their regular menu. They do close at 4pm during the week so don't expect dinner if your want a fix from their place."}
{"text":"A great place to have fluffy pancakes, eggs the way you like it. They even roasted some sliced tomatoes for me instead of the usual hash browns. It was delicious. 

I have gone back several times and each time, I prefer it to the other place I used to go to (as they have seem to cut back on quality) so it's nice to have a place you can rely on for a good breakfast treat."}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome pancakes!
Never dined in, only take out so far. 
Pancakes are fluffy yet thick - banana pancakes honestly are the best I've ever had. I'm one that likes to make their pancakes from scratch. But terry's I think are way better than what I make! They taste homemade and they do not skimp on the banana. They're warm and gooey, love these! 
The staff are so friendly and nice to you. Can't go wrong here, especially if you like pancakes!"}
{"text":"this place is a wonderful hidden gem! cheaper and better food then cora's (if you want to overpay for fancy cut fruit, go right ahead!) 
staff is always remembers your face and always friendly.
Food is good, comfort food. plentiful and cheap! 

The apple caramel pancakes are sinful and HUGE (enough for 2-3 people!)"}
{"text":"Great Neighborhood restaurant, We moved into the area almost 2 years ago and have eaten at Terrys almost once a week. Everything on the menu is delicious I have tried pretty much everything, Personal favourite of mine is the Liver and Onions coming from a person that does not like gravy once i had Terry's changed my opinion completely.  Everything is homemade and nothing is out of box or freezer bag.  Fresh food and the price is really reasonable.  The staff are amazing very kind and courteous.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Family-owned/run restaurants are always interesting because they can be so hit-and-miss. But once you get a \"hit\", there's always something special about it because it brings a different charm from big fancy places: There's always the warm welcome, the cozy/homey atmosphere, and the overly-generous helping of hearty home-cooked heaps of food.

Terry's is definitely one of those \"hits\". We went to this Greek restaurant for breakfast and left with a (wonderful) food coma. We had:
- Spanakopita omelette: A great way to put a Greek twist to the standard breakfast omelette.  Plus they were super generous in the fresh spinach and feta cheese they stuffed into it.
- Gyro and eggs: Seems a bit weird, but the combination worked. The gyros were cooked well, though a bit too salty for my taste. I had them with soft poached eggs, which were done well.
- Apple caramel pancakes: 3 huge fluffy pancakes, with generous slices of apple in and around them, and the caramel soaked throughout. I wad afraid the caramel would be too much but it actually wasn't as overpowering as I thought.

We joked with one of the servers before our meal that we may have over-ordered and she reassured us they had take-away boxes on standby. To both our delight, those weren't needed. We'll definitely be back, maybe next time to try their lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Scarborough, hands down. They have the best burgers; so juicy and full of flavour. I was recommended  by a friend. She told me that their food was amazing and that it was her favourite restaurant in Scarborough. I thought she was over-hyping. Not at all. The waitresses are super friendly and the chef is a sweetheart. I would recommend the Canadian or Mama Mia Burger, as well as their poutine. My friend also says that their gyro is amazing! 5/5"}
{"text":"Have walked by this place at least a dozen times every time I pop into my favourite Hakka place Fredericks. 

Decided to try something new based on the reviews on Yelp. 

Terry's is a great souvlaki restaurant that serves up traditional Greek style food (souvlaki, gyros, Greek salad) and a variety of other dishes including hot sandwiches, pastas, steak, all day breakfast, etc. 

The dining room is clean and tidy with a couple of TV's to keep you entertained. I've never been here before and so I'm not sure if it's been recently renovated, but it looks like it has been. 

Service was prompt and friendly. 

Ordered the Gyro Pita Combo. It's gyro served in a warm pita with lettuce, onion, tomato and tzatziki sauce beautifully wrapped in foil to hold it all together. The combo is served with fresh fries and a good sized Greek salad. 

The gyro pita was delicious. The owner showed us a clever way to eat it while preserving the foil to keep things clean. 

Fries were fresh and hot! The salad was delicious and perfectly dressed. Not too much dressing and not too little. 

All in all a great first experience and will definitely return to try some other deliciousness."}
{"text":"I was getting my hair cut at a nearby barber shop and finished just in time for lunch so I consulted my Yelp app for nearby recommendations and came across all the good reviews for Terry's. For some reason I had expected an old-school greasy spoon diner type setup with mostly counter service so I was happy to see that my assumptions were incorrect and my expectations far exceeded. The decor is on the darker side, appropriate for dinner, and they have a proper bar with seating. I guess I should have looked at the pictures on Yelp.

They have a breakfast/brunch menu with lots of choices, ranging from the standard bacon and egss to Eggs Benedict, AAA Rib-Eye Steak and Eggs, Pancakes, Belgian Waffles, and more. Their main menu shows a lot of burgers, sandwiches, salads, steaks, some fish, and pasta. There are definite influences of Greek and Italian.

It took me a while to decide since there were so many choices. Did I want a late breakfast or an early lunch? Brunch? I settled on a steak sandwich with mushrooms and cheddar with fries. I wasn't disappointed. It was a generous serving, cooked just right. The steak was tender and the fries were crispy. Very good!

The service was efficient and very friendly. Prices were cheap, especially after seeing the portions being served at other tables. I could tell that there were several regular guests dining there. If I lived closer, I would be here more often. For now, I'll just have to plan my barber shop visits around meal times."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh mannnnnnnn! The sweet and savoury waffle. Outstanding! Great service and family atmosphere! Our waitress was amazing and the kids had a great time. Definitely worth going time and time again. Thanks guys. John"}
{"text":"Gyro and eggs should not work but they do! I stumbled Upon This Place by mistake on my way
 to work and thought I'd give it a shot based on the reviews. Am I glad I did! Who knew that such an incredible place was so close to my work! One nice thing about this place is that they have a breakfast special -  bacon, ham, sausage, three eggs home fries and toast for $5.99! The special last until 11 a.m. which is really late! Unfortunately they don't do any substitutions so since I don't eat any of those meats, I opted for the Gyros and eggs with comes with home fries and toast.
I was a bit worried before I ordered it, but I thought is the Greek restaurant... Their specialty is gyro so what's the worst that could happen. I was pleasantly surprised with the perfect combination of eggs and perfectly cooked gyros!

If you're in the area and you're looking for a quick place for breakfast come here, the service is great the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was very decent but the service was absolutely terrible. I called in for a reservation with a large group - understanding it was during a busy Sunday but they were so incredibly rude. We were already very understanding that it was busy and told more than half our group to leave to go elsewhere for lunch even though we were on a time crunch. Mediocre place not sure I'll go back"}
{"text":"Good value, good flavour, good service. You really can't ask for much more.

Dropped by with a friend for brunch. He had the pancakes and liked them. I had eggs with home fries and liked it. Great serving size for the price. Service is more on the no-frills side but what do you expect for a diner type place like this. Waitress was friendly though. It's kind of a small place and the seating is somewhat limited.

I'm rarely ever in the area but wouldn't mind coming back if I ever am!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Vicki is such a sweet waitress and the food was amazing and cheap."}
{"text":"All day breakfast.  Parking a bit tough (same plaza as Federicks) but it offers great food, great prices and great service.  Local gem."}
{"text":"Awesome eggs omelette! Tasty and fulfilling which i think is much better than eggsmart."}
{"text":"This place is horrible I asked for fries well done and they put a pound of salt on it. Honesty if you're looking for junk food greasy and salty this place is for you"}
{"text":"I typically do not post a lot of reviews on Yelp (out of sheer laziness), however this is definitely one that I needed to write about. Hands down the best Greek Salad and Chicken I have ever had. The chicken is moist and tasty and keeps you wanting more. The salad is absolutely delicious and for the first time I didn't need extra salad dressing - the salad dressing was not too acidic or oily it was perfect. It is honestly one of the best I have ever had. From what I understand it is a family run business and a lot of their food is made to order and fresh. I don't think this place gets enough credit. The service is superb and our waitress was always checking on us and ensured we were comfortable. I would go back here again...heck I've been craving it since I was there."}
{"text":"This little corner restaurant and bar has some great breakfast they serve all day. My boyfriend and I had a late breakfast as our last meal in Toronto before heading back stateside, and it was great. I ordered the eggs florentine. It comes with potatoes that are nearly perfectly fried to have a crunch outside and soft inside. I'm not a huge fan of potatoes and I was amazed with how perfect they were cooked. They did have a slight taste as if they're fried in oil used for other things too, without that little taste i would say they deserve five stars. The poached eggs and spinach were also perfectly executed. My boyfriend and I shared blueberry pancakes that again were just slightly off perfect. Definitely great and way better than I hoped. My boyfriends bacon was perfect and delicious. Overall, I would recommend and I would go again if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant a few tries. It's the kind of place I should like. Independent family owned restaurants are my favorite. 

Here is what I have found after 4 meals. Lunches and breakfasts. 

The breakfast is quantity over quality. Besides the eggs and potatoes the ingredients they use are of the poorest quality.  Avoid any ham or breakfast sausage. Yuck...  Performed minced ham and low grade breakfast sausages. Powdered hollandaise sauce on the eggs too. 

The lunch isn't much better. I ordered their special Greek burger. I couldn't stomach it.  the burger was so heavily laden with bread crumbs I couldn't taste the beef. 

Bad food is one thing....  But poor service is another hallmark of this place. Aside from the cook who seems personable. The waitresses are glum..  gruff..  and slow.  The last time I was here I specifically asked if the ham on the eggs benedict was the minced type ham. The waitress assured me that it was purchased by her. Funny that she claimed it was \"Black Forest Virginia Ham\".  Should have know that she didn't have a clue from that answer alone. 

So. I won't be returning. For the life of me I don't understand the charitable reviews of this place."}
{"text":"In Canada on business. This place is fantastic. I had the Gyro dinner. It came with a Greek salad, rice, potatoes and meat. Highly recommend. The staff is friendly. I will be back every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic food & service... Coffee is smooth and the Sweet & Salty (aka Breakfast on a Waffle) was excellent..."}
{"text":"Good solid brunch! Came for Mother's Day, good service and they gave lovely flowers to my Mom!"}
{"text":"This place is fast, delicious and has friendly service. Definitely holds up to its Yelps reviews.  I would return for sure."}
{"text":"This review is based on take-out.

Food: 4 stars
They had made good choices on their menu but my friends and I were pretty sold on their chicken pita pictures. The chicken pita had a fair amount of chicken in it. the chicken wasn't as tender and juicy as I was hoping but the sauce made up for it. You can choose to order the pita by itself or with a combo. We all got combos which were $10.95 and came with salad and fries. I LOVED the pita bread! It was soft, thick, and chewy! The fries and salad were okay, I wish the fries were a bit crispier and the salad dressing had a bit more lemon in it. All in all, my friends and I enjoyed our chicken pitas and look forward to trying their breakfast food next time. Great value for great food here!

Ambiance: 4 stars
Terry's is located in a small building plaza right at Bellamy and Markham Rd. They have limited parking in the front but there's more around the back. The interior of the restaurant has a bit of an 80s vibe. It's sort of a cross between a diner and a pub. Nice little spot to hang out with friends. Will hope to dine-in next time. 

Service: 4 stars
Our food was ready for pick up as soon as I got there. The waitresses were all very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Just had the protein breakfast. Kind of like Eggsmart. Individual items placed on a wide plate. Expected a more savoury presentation being that it is a diner. Bland but filling. For the price the coffee should be included. Not exactly gourmet coffee. Good service and a neighbourhood feel. Was expecting the breakfast to have more of a personal touch."}
{"text":"This review of Terry's Restaurant & Bar is based on Early Bird Breakfast $5.99 before 11 am. 

The special has a really generous time frame, I would not consider myself \"Early\" if I am having breakfast at 10:30 am.

The portion was generous. Food was cook when ordered. I really hate eating cold home fries or sausage that have been sitting under the heater for the longest time. 

The only complaint maybe that I did not get my coffee refilled even once....

The other item on the menu all looks quite good. If they all prepared with the attention as they do with my Breakfast Specials, I think this could be a winner!"}
{"text":"Great lunch/brunch eatery. Highly recommend for a delicious reasonably priced meals.
Servers were efficient , most pleasant and helpful. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Can't believe I never reviewed this place! They have the most amazing burgers here - we got the big fat Greek burger as well as the mozza burger and we were blown away! The coleslaw wasn't amazing, but got the palate cleansing done. The Greek burger was insanely juicy, with strong flavours and gooey feta cheese. The mozza burger was simplicity done perfectly, with a little extra cheese on top. Both burgers were huge and I left super stuffed, just for about $20 for both burgers and coleslaw on the side.

Service wasn't anything to write home about, and the place wasn't incredibly immaculate or anything but it had the feel of a homey little dive bar, with amazing food to boot."}
{"text":"Awesome Greek burgers and salad... Fresh and authentic. Well priced aswell. Would definitely return"}
{"text":"Pretty busy spot, came in on a Friday morning and it was packed. People sitting at the bar at 10:30am for breakfast as the tables were full. 

We sat ourselves and we're acknowledged within minutes. Server was extremely nice and presentable. We ordered coffee and received it almost within seconds. This was surprising seeing how busy the place was. 

After about 8-10 minutes, our breakfast arrived. I had ordered the protein breakfast which came with a lot of meat (two types of ham, sausage, bacon) and it delivered. With a side order of potatoes, I was full till almost dinner. As some others have said though, the breakfast potatoes were extremely salty. 

Overall, great fast service and the food was above par when compared to sunset/Coras. I would definitely return for breakfast again if I am in the area. 

3/5 for me!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Came out quickly. Bacon was cooked perfectly. Very friendly owners and staff. We were just visiting the area and came back two days in a row for breakfast. Breakfast specials until 11am and a very good deal."}
