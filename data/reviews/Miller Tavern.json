{"text":"The Miller is great!  We visited last night for the first time (took the in-laws as it's a place you can actually have a quality visit and quality food).    They have a private parking lot which is awesome if you want to drive!  We all had drinks - the wine was great (we ordered a some, although they also do BYOW, which is a plus) and I tried a Raspberry cocktail which was also great (served in a mason jar with mint).  Our starter were exceptional - chicken spring rolls and bruschetta.  3/4 of us wanted lighter meals, meals were spinach salad with chicken, cobb salad, a burger and sweet potato fries and tortellini.  They lose one star in my opinion because there was no special dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries and we could have had a similar meal elsewhere for a lower price point.    Overall, we had a great first experience!"}
{"text":"We went to Miller Tavern to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I requested a table in a quiet area and we got a nice table upstairs near the small bar.   The 7 of us decided to share appetizers so we split the Thai steamed mussels and calamari (2), which had a nice spicy zing to it. Everyone enjoyed their mains and the generous portions.  Everything from pumpkin ravioli, to steak, to braised beef short ribs.  I especially enjoyed my pan roast halibut with shrimp mashed potatoes and lobster cream sauce.   Then came dessert.  We had chocolate fondue (2) which was more than enough for us. The ambiance there is great.  The main bar is on ground level, and the dining area is upstairs.  On a Friday night, after work, it was busy but was never too loud to hear each other. Our server Howie was exceptional!  He went above and beyond our expectations!  He definitely made it a memorable meal."}
{"text":"Visited the North York location which is great for large reservations.  Servers were attentive.  The seafood soup was the highlight of my meal with lobster bisque, scallops and shrimp.  Ambiance is what you would expect due to the neighbourhood.  Main course was the beef prime roast rib au jus which was huge, however could have used more au jus.  Would go back again if it was convenient for others but not again for the flavours."}
{"text":"Great food, only to be ruined by air-conditioning!! I asked the host if they could possibly turn it down, but got a nope, she gets asked that all the time but management will not turn the AC down...  That is too bad.. as I could find hundreds of similar restaurants in the area to go to instead of this place.. as I will in the future."}
{"text":"I have dined both up and downstairs, lunch and dinner for 10+ years.  The food is consistently excellent!  The washrooms are renovated, very clean. Free parking is great (and unusual for Toronto) Staff is friendly, professional, attentive.    The lobster cobb salad served on the Sunday brunch meal was devine... I savoured each morsel (but was tempted to devour it) can't wait to go back! Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"The food was good and the services good. Prep time for food was longer than expected. Almost 45 minutes between appetizers"}
{"text":"Whoa! This place as it all.  Great atmosphere, great food, good service (service level dropped a little bit through out our meal), and prices are not bad for what you get!!  This one will definitely be one in our rotation from now on!"}
{"text":"The menu does not match the dining experience you think you're going to have. I have not had everything on the menu but every time I dine at Miller I am underwhelmed.  When I go out to eat to places like Miller I want a wow experience - something that I cannot make at home for example. I continue to be disappointed about the menu but the location and ambiance is great."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Miller for dinner on a Saturday night. We should have known things weren't going to go well, when we were sniffingly asked at the door if we had a reservation - this was quite comical considering the restaurant was maybe half full.  It stayed that way the entire time we were there, so it wasn't like they were doing us some big favour to find a table.  We wanted to sit downstairs as we knew that the upstairs was less causal.  The prices were very high and more on a par with a top notch downtown restaurant; they are certainly not reflective of the food or service at the Miller.  To call our server lifeless, is being kind.  She was so disengaged, and lacking in personality that it was unbelieveable.  I don't believe she ever came close to smiling or appearing welcoming.  Definitely someone who doesn't like her job.  And, we rarely saw her, as each piece of the meal seems to be delivered by someone else.  We ordered the Prime rib dinner for 2. At $56 for 2 it was actually the cheapest thing on the menu other than the ravioli. The meal included a choice of soup or Caesar salad. My husband ordered the soup which was tomato avocado and I had the caesar salad. Although the server didn't tell us that the soup was spicy, it was so heavy on chili that his mouth was burning. As for the Caesar salad, this may have been the first time I didn't finish one. I love Caesar salad and I love garlic, but this one had so much garlic in it, that as I continued it became close to inedible. No one checked with us while we were eating to see if things were okay. I did tell the server about the salad when she eventually reappeared, but I didn't want anything else.  The main course consisted of a serving of luke warm mashed potatoes on our individual (cold) plates, and a platter on which there was a massive slab of roast beef, some green beans and carrot coins, 2 Yorkshire puddings and 2 little jugs of gravy. First of all, the entire meal was cold. The gravy had actually started to congeal. The server had told us in advance that the beef is served medium rare, which was fine, because we usually order meat rare to medium rare. This meat wasn't even rare. It was bluer than  blue! In fact, it was raw.  I tried one piece of meat and actually choked to the point of needing assistance. It was so undercooked that it was impossible to swallow. The Yorkshire puddings had been sitting for so long that they were rubbery.  Again, no one checked with us to see if things were okay, so my husband went to find the server. We showed her the meat and she immedately agreed it was undercooked and took the whole thing away. The replacement meal was much smaller (smaller piece of meat and far fewer vegetables) but at least it was cooked and hot. The beef was average in taste and extremely fatty. The Yorkshire puddings were dense. The veggies and mashed potatoes were good.   Although we weren't expecting it, and it is not necessary, most restaurants make some kind of a goodwill gesture, when they know there has been a problem with the food - a drink, a dessert, something.  Not the Miller - nada.  We decided to go somewhere else for coffee and dessert since our meal had been so underwhelming. We won't be back. At these prices, there are lots of far superior restaurants around."}
{"text":"This place is a local classics, having been a landmark in the area for over 200 years (at one point owned by my great-great-great-grandparents!) The staff is always top notch, the food is too! The patio, however, is my absolute favourite. It's lush and green, with a layered patio to give some intimacy. You definitely can hear Yonge street and it's hard to ignore, but if you come at non-peak times, you can really enjoy the patio. Tons of parking- great for events too."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for my birthday.  I have nothing to complain about, the atmosphere was good, the food was superb (I had a steak and shrimp) and service was great.  Will definitely come back again, we just live so close to this place that it will be our go-to place to celebrate any occasion!"}
{"text":"This will be my first and last time coming here. Came only because we had gift certificates.  We arrived around 7:30pm on a Friday night. The parking lot was full but the restaurant did not reflect that as I noticed it was just a little over half capacity and no line ups.  We were seated promptly in a booth by the window. The decor, fit and finish and feel and ambiance  of the restaurant was nice. It took a little over 5 minutes before we were greeted by our server who didn't give her name.  She took our drink and food orders and came back with the drinks promptly, soda for me and wine for the missus, and brought water as well. App and food came very soon after that.   App: Blue crap and shrimp cakes (2 pieces which resembled the crab claws at Chinese restaurants)  were good but I've had better.  Entree: Missus had Sirloin Dinner (med) and I had the Kansas City Steak (med rare)  Everything was going good.  After our food arrived is where the evening went downhill.  I ordered my entree first with salad but changed to baked potato but I guess she forgot to change it and it came out with salad. No biggie.  Our entrees did not come out with steak knives like some places have it so we had to flag down another waiter after sitting and staring at our food for several minutes. I contemplated eating with the plain knife!!! But I would learn later that it would've been the same had I used a spoon to cut the steak.  Her entree came with 2 of the 3 sides missing and when we pointed that out to our server she notified the kitchen and it was brought out a few minutes later, while good, an apology would have mended fences better.  When we finished and the bus boy (who gave the best service of the night) cleared our table we sat there for several minutes before our server came to take my cup for a refill (which I declined). After sitting for another 10 minutes chatting and finishing her wine we called for the bill. I guess they don't have any dessert, coffee or tea because we were never offered. Total after tax and tip $150.  Overall I would rate: Location and look of the restaurant 4/5. Bus boy 5/5. Server 2/5. Food 2/5.  For similar pricing I would recommend The Keg, Ruth's Chris, McDonald's, Moxies', etc over this place."}
{"text":"Overpriced, food is bad, we ordered the soup, and the chef made a mistake and put curry powder with lots of salt, it was disgusting, and how did they attempt to make up for it? they got us an extra desert, what a joke. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Brunch Review: Overpriced and underwhelming. The pastry basket was cold and seemed like it had been previously frozen. The biscuits with the eggs benedict were HARD. I had to ask for a different knife to cut through it. Every course was cold, down to the dessert. The only part that was satisfactory were the drinks and coffee. They seat you in the bar area for brunch with blaring classic rock music; not ideal for a brunch ambiance. The city is loaded with brunch options, choose to spend your morning elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's Day with my daughters and friends and had a good time and the food was great. Nice ambiance!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first when I read the not-so-good reviews, but unfortunately some of my fellow Yelpers are right -- ok food at best, but mediocre service for what's supposed to be a country club-esque establishment.  Let's start with the food. I got the fixed price brunch: cranberry juice to start, crabcake benedict main, and an apple cinnamon butter cake to finish. The homemade biscuits that came with the crabcake benedict were very dry, but I guess that's why there's all that runny egg yolk to go with it. The apple cinnamon butter cake, while a generous portion, was also way too sweet. I couldn't ask for enough tea to rinse that situation out.  The service left much to be desired. The gentleman who took care of us was gruff from the get-go. Shortly after we placed our orders I heard him complaining to his colleagues about something not related to work. OK, so maybe you're having a bad day...but please don't take it out on your customers/colleagues!  He was pretty blase the rest of the time we were there, and shortly after coming by to check in on our desserts (we weren't even half done), he proceeded to leave us with the bill. My friend had a coupon that she didn't even have a chance to present to him. So when she asked him about it, we got a \"Oh, well then I guess I'll need to print you another bill.\" Way to state the obvious, my friend!! We never even asked for the first print of the bill to begin with. It wasn't like the place was packed and they needed the table back for another party.  To make matters worse, I heard him say \"God help me\" once right after he walked away from our table to reprint our bill, and once again right as he walked away after he processed our payments (!!!!!!!!!!!)  It was also the first time I ever had my credit card snatched out of my hand...I never thought it would happen here of all places. You don't need to roll out the red carpet for us, but some basic courtesy would have gone a long way.  So there you have it. Given all the dining options we have around town, I'm in no real rush to come back to this place. Save your time and money...it's not worth spending either here."}
{"text":"I visited the Miller Tavern last weekend and I have to say that it is now one of my favourite places. The food was amazing, every single thing that we tried from the starter platter, the seafood soup, lobster thermidor (we visited during the Lobster festival), the chocolate dessert were amazing. The only thing that I didn't care for was the bread, you pay $3 for \"artisanal\" bread and it is 4 slices of room temperature bread, I wasn't too thrilled about it, but I completely forgot about it when I ate my lobster Thermidor which is served with several types of mushrooms (delicious) and pasta (the pasta wasn't great either, too much oregano, I recommend that you substitute this one).   For dessert I had was the chocolate one and it was amazing! Not too sweet, amazing textures that melt in your mouth. On top of it, we received complimentary dessert wine, what else can you ask for?? Staff was attentive and went above and beyond when I asked what types of mushrooms were in my dish, he came back with a list... Will go back there for sure!"}
{"text":"We hosted a dinner for my family on Saturday.  We collected the children, nieces and nephews of my recently deceased aunt to celebrate her life.  Since our prior experiences at The Miller were all exceptional we were convinced that this was the perfect venue. Little that was offered to us by The Miller staff and kitchen enhanced our evening, and the success of our family dinner was in spite of The Miller rather than because of it.  I now deeply regret our choice.  We were seated in one half of a large private room, with a wooden screen separating us from another party.  The other party included at least 5 young children who were running around, rolling on the floor, yelling and screaming loudly . . . and the noise was intrusive into our party's purpose:  to celebrate and honour the memory of our recently departed aunt, and mother.  I immediately explained this to our waitress and asked that she have a conversation with the other party.  She refused.  We all were assembled by about 7:30 p.m., and drink orders were taken a couple of times.  But we were then left alone for another hour!  Finally at 8:30, we had to look for someone to take our order! We encouraged our guests to choose anything they wanted on the menu.  Clearly, The Miller staff had no interest in ensuring the dinner was great! We found a manager to finally take our order, and told us it was a very busy evening (so we were not being served, or checked on for an hour because of it?). The food arrived after another hour AND . . . the quality was lack luster at best!  MEDIOCRE:  Prime Rib OK; the mashed Yukon Gold potatoes - tepid, tasteless and dry.  Nothing we were served reminded me of previous visits. Ultimate insult:  the children knocked down the wooden screen divider, and it would have fallen on the backs of the heads of half our party if one of the other diners had not caught it in time.  Unacceptable behavior of the children, and unacceptable handling by The Miller. Those adult guests were unfair to bring those children there at all, and your staff knew exactly what would happen once our party arrived. By the end of the evening, we not only had not received a single apology, but insult to injury, we were shocked by the automatic addition of a $90 tip to the bill, without acknowledging that our experience truly did not deserve that gratuity. Do you know what GRATUITY really means? The Miller was unable and/or unwilling to improve our experience, and grabbed the tip anyway.  The best thing about our dinner was the love and good will of my family; that we rose above the challenges and failures presented by The Miller, and we were able to ensure the real purpose of our congregating was fulfilled, and it was . . . . . no thanks to The Miller!"}
{"text":"The menu is not extensive, but they are good at whatever they make, always fresh oysters and salads, wide variety of wines will not leave anyone disappointed. Convenient location, on Yonge St. by the subway and a 401 exit with plenty of parking, great veranda and two levels of the patio with both smoking and non-smoking sections. If you are by the bar, make sure to try some of the best martinis in town. I have visited the place more than 50 times and I keep wondering how they manage to always keep around the most professional of service staff, I took 4 of my office associates out for lunch and we each ordered a drink, an appetizer and a main course, waitress serving us memorized each of our orders without writing it down, while some upscale places have up to 3 people serving a table of five and would still manage to misplace or confuse an item or two per order. Great place for corporate events in their lounge area and if there are no private parties there, make sure to grab a seat by the fireplace and cozy up with a glass of merlot, as it is as warm of an atmosphere outside of home as it gets."}
{"text":"Food is good, however I found the portions to be extremely small, especially for the price being paid!!  Did a bday dinner with 17 guests, and found the service to be slow and some what poor. Reservations were followed up very nicely, lots of parking !!"}
{"text":"Quite a good place to dine.  Nice vibe of this two level establishment. Upstairs has a beautiful veranda for an open floor to ceiling view seating. There are beautiful trees in the fall season which are visable during the day and night. It makes a lovely setting and much better than seating in a typical enclosed area with pictures hung on the wall.   Service good. Food taste quite excellent. Preparation, presentation and drink selection also very good. We had ordered that night to start, shrimp and crab cakes, for our meals chicken & spinach penne, and halibut steak with tomato bouillabaisse green beans & red potato  Been here for lunch and dinner. Consistant all around so I'll be going back here in the future for sure."}
{"text":"Generally I have an excellent time here, and the serving staff and food were very good on Saturday May 9. However, the Saturday morning manager was terrible! Earlier in the week the Miller Tavern's reception took a reservation for 11:00 - but they do not open until noon. We came from various parts of the city including Port Credit and Stouffville so when we arrived on time, 11 as per our reservation, we were not about to try to find another restaurant. The manager however was belligerent and hostile. He never apologized and we were the ones who had to suggest/insist we be allowed to sit and wait. He truly should consider a career change as he does not like customers! Our waitress was lovely and helped save the day. The manager should have been polite, he should have apologized for the mistake made by whoever took the telephone reservation, and he should have offered a complimentary coffee! I wil return, but I will always tell the story of the bad manager -- and have told 5 people today alone.  (Apparently the manager whispered to the poor hostess: Why didn't you lock the door, when our party walked in. Ouch)  3 stars for Saturday's experience. I would normally give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Oh que c'est cher ! Oui c'est historique mais que c'est cher pour ce qu'on commande. J'avoue que le \"calamari\", c'est à dire de l'encornet ou calmar, comme vous voulez, était vraiment bien cuit (pas caoutchouteux comme cela arrive trop souvent). Évitez aussi les boissons type single malt, pour le prix de deux verres vous pourriez acheter une bouteille au LCBO."}
{"text":"Yucca.  Overpriced bland food and horrible service. The only thing that saved the morning was the outdoor patio which was pretty nice, except it was a scorcher and the server didn't feel like challenging himself to open the umbrella. I paid 20$ for a small spinach salad with a few watermelon cubes and goat cheese and a cup of coffee that i had to beg to be refilled.   Oh and the brunch menu...nothing on the sweet side (pancakes, waffles, fruit salad, oatmeal, granola and yoghurt...) which is always challenging for those of us not into eggs. Oh sorry, there was a salad option...for brunch!!?!??!?!?! ugh.   Yucca. Never again."}
{"text":"I've been to Millers for lunch many times and usually the service is fantastic.  Went for brunch on a Sunday, the service was awful.  The waitress was surly and downright unfriendly.  Never checked on us once after we got our meals, she actually only came by to collect our plates and only said thank you and you're welcome at the end when we asked for our bill because she thought her tip was coming.   For an $80 brunch for two I was disappointed and will not come back for the crappy service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Miller Tavern's North York location is conveniently situated by York Mills TTC Station. You may have drove by it numerous times going down Yonge Street - The building sits by itself in the heart of Hogg's Hollow ( I really need to explore this area a bit more).   I've heard great things about their patio as you're surrounded by mother nature, including the mosquitoes which prompted me to move to an indoor table. We were lucky to have an awesome server who cracked jokes the whole time - I wish I remembered his name.. Howie I think!   For starters, I ordered the Miller Caesar ($9) - It wasn't the best I've had but the romaine was sauced very evenly with a hint of anchovy. We also ordered the Sesame Ahi Tuna ($14.50) - my taste buds were pleasantly surprised by how well the wasabi cream and ponzu sauce went together. It was presented beautifully, with guacamole, salsa, pickled ginger on watermelon tortilla chips. I was an excellent mix of Japan and Mexico!   I had the Centre Cut Filet Mignon and for only $2.95 you can add Lobster Tail! I've never seen anywhere else that offers this price. I thought the lobster tail would be tiny, but it was nice, plump and tasted really fresh. Unfortunately, my filet mignon did not come medium rare as requested, but more on the well done side. Our amazing server immediately took my plate back to the kitchen and came back with additional side salad so I got to eat something at least. The second plate was cooked medium rare, but the quality of the steak is not the best - It was a bit hard to chew through the tendons, which I've never seen in filet mignons..   Our apologetic server gave us two complimentary desserts to make up for the overcooked steak. We tried the Vanilla Creme Brulee - It was good, but nothing amazing, and the Deep Dish Peanut Butter Pie - now this is delicious, made with brown butter Bourbon crème anglaise.. great, now I'm craving it!   Overall, Miller's Tavern is great for a casual night out for decently priced food with decent quality. The service is awesome, I just have to note that again! I will be back! (Did I mention plenty of parking in the back?)"}
{"text":"Let's start with a positive note: one of the nicest patios in town!!!  Unfortunately that is the only reason it got the two stars from me.  Poor (or better, non-existing) service, mediocre drinks, ordinary food, but at least the $5.50 happy hour price is compatible."}
{"text":"I had the lamb burger and sweet potato fries. Both were very good. The service was very professional and attentive. The location is conveniently located off the 401 and the parking is free. The prices are a bit on the higher end, but it was an overall pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Geez what happened to this place!? I've eaten here almost a dozen times over the last decade, this was my first time back in about a year. Three of us had lunch entrees and an appetizer, and absolutely everything we ordered was - as another Yelper noted - at the level of bad cafeteria food. The dim sum appetizer was truly disgusting, worse even than any frozen varieties I've tasted. The only thing decent were the sweet potato fries. Not sure if the management or chef has changed, but sadly I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"been here multiple times and was very disappointed the last couple times I had dealings with them. They seem stingy in a petty sort of way you wouldn't expect when paying $30 for a steak.   The atmosphere and food are good as well as the location, but the service is pretentious and petty. This place is fairly expensive for a tavern, definitely above average bar prices but when you have dinner you have to order the bread and butter for $3.5 where most nice restaurants at a similar price point just bring the bread over.   Also, the waitress we had the last time had an attitude when answering some menu questions and then we still had to call her over in order for her to take our dinner order after we've put down the menus and she still wasn't back. You'd think us asking questions about the dinner option would be an indication that we wanted dinner.   Finally, after we ordered dessert she came out a few minutes later to inform us that they didn't have the ice cream that the pecan pie should come with. She asked if we wanted vanilla or chocolate ice cream instead. We said both to which she replied \"i'll see what i can do, but which do you prefer if I can't get both?\" our dessert only came with one. Another example if pettiness, when they are missing an ingredient for a $9 dessert they can't spare an extra scoop of ice cream? And I also think it's bad practice if servers really don't have the authority to give the customer a little something extra to keep them happy. In this case though I don't think our waitress ever had any intention of asking anyone for anything for us."}
{"text":"Had a really different experience this time around - and I was pleasantly surprised how not busy it was for a Saturday night dinner.  Got to sit at one of those lovely circular booths, and fits 5 people comfortably.  Our waitress was very attentive - so different from the last one.  I started out with the Oysters, and perhaps I had not had them in a long time, but they were lovely. Malpeques from PEI; perfectly plump and briny.  Then for my main, I had the lovely Wild Salmon which sat atop a bed of lovely quinoa and bak choy. I so enjoyed that dish that every morsel was gone!  And finally for dessert, that chocolate waffle was so, so, SO, yum. I highly recommend that for dessert.  Overall, I really enjoyed the food, drinks, ambiance and service, so definitely willing to come here more often now."}
{"text":"Good environment, great food, but awful service. The cutlery directly on the desk, no napkins."}
{"text":"This has the worst food ever, the only thing that is edible is the Filet Mignon is the only thing that is  decent.  The Lamb poutine lacks gravy...hello where is the lamb??? Couldn't find it.   Its a good place to meet for first dates, its close to the 401 and subway...that is all I can say about it....FOOD SUCKS, LOCATION GOOD, WINE SO SO."}
{"text":"Awesome butter chicken -great patio in the summer- I love places that invest good money in huge hanging flower baskets, it makes all the difference. You totally forget you are in such an urban setting and sitting right on the longest street in the world. And the management was SOOOOOOO nice to us, giving us a coupon for a free meal for next visit just because we were chatty. Thanks Miller !!!!!!!! I used to visit your place for live music in your previous incarnation- the reno has made you MUCH BETTER"}
{"text":"Miller Patio truly does have a great patio. It's surrounded by plenty of foliage (trees) that make it seem like a private escape despite being so close to hustle and bustle of Yonge and York Mills in North York.  I've never dined inside this location, the patio lunch was pretty much my first experience here ever. Staff was attentive and friendly and seemed to make strong recommendations from the menu but not so much from the cocktail menu. 3-4 star  Speaking of the food, it was meh-ok, I had a salad with chicken breast and I found the chicken to be dry and overcooked, while the salad was pretty good and well dressed. Average overall - 3 star!  I had a tough time evaluating their cocktails as they did have a great selection and overall I would have to give them high marks on the craftsmanship and taste. The prices of the cocktails were a touch higher than I would typically pay, but I guess I can understand this place has a certain level of prestige they are trying to uphold.  Speaking of price and prestige, as I said I can appreciate them attempting to set a certain bar, however, when I end up shelling out over $50 for a small-medium sized salad with a chicken breast and 2 cocktails, you've got to get your head checked - ludicrous pricing. I mean it's still a patio experience overall, eating the least expensive (cost wise) menu item, and 2 basic coctails should not rival dinner for 1 at the keg mansion.... Perhaps management may want to work on this.   Overall a 3.. I'd be back if invited BUT I'll be sure to watch my bottom line next time I pay them a visit.   Eatcrest Out (for a week)!"}
{"text":"The best things about this restaurant is the set up and ambience, including the patio.  As for the rest, friendly enough service and nice civilized vibe but it's just a bit overpriced for what you get in terms of food.  It's not terrible and I think I'll come back one day but the food quality felt consistently average across the meal and that sentiment was shared by everyone at my table across a variety of different dishes."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Miller Tavern! I've been there several times throughout the years and it's truly a gem in North York.   It's a historical landmark turned into a restaurant and bar (look up the history if you're interested), and really feels cozy on the inside. I love coming here in the wintertime because of the warm interior design. I have to say, I haven't been there in the summer but I heard they have a great outdoor patio.  The service is top notch, even when you're sitting in the bar area. The wait staff is quick to take your order, and to clear the table.  The food is a bit pricey, but then again I am on a student budget. If you feel like treating yourself and staying in North York, this is your go-to. They're close to York Mills Station, and best of all- they have easy parking in the back!   I'm a fan of their seafood dishes, their dessert menu, and their cocktails.   The steak however is missing flavour...  If you're thinking of trying this place out, do it! It's a great place to take your date, or to catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"This restaurant was nice. A little hard to find parking but their food was good. I got the ceaser salad which I wish had a bit of dressing but just a little bit of cheese instead. I asked for my roasted beef to be made medium rare and it was perfect, they did a goood job cooking. I got the creme brulee to finish and it was great and definitely a bigger portion then j expected."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with my girlfriend, the place is nice and inviting, well maintained and friendly staff. Food quality was great, we ordered the filet mignon and New York steaks for our meal and they were cooked excellently and quite delicious. The only reason I can't give five stars based on this visit is that they are a bit over priced, each steak cost 42 and came with a simple side, a bit pricier compared to what you could get at the keg with bread and a bit more on the side."}
{"text":"GREAT place....the ideal local tavern...yet more than a tavern...food is fabulous...decor is nice...great outdoor patios in nice weather...a big improvement over the original \"Jolly Miller\"!!"}
{"text":"Miller has great food  drinks n service!  Since I work nearby; visits to the Miller for AWDs (after work drinks, yeah thats what we call them) are frequent in summer.   The This and That platter works out great for sharing.  Oysters on the menu always wins a star for me!  Lamb poutine and lamb burger is my fav on their menu. Although the poutine was kinda disappointing last time.   It's slightly on the $$$ side but I'd say worth the quality"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner on the veranda on the second floor. Food was good, atmosphere was nice, although a little loud due to the large parties around us. Lots of choices on the menu. The deep dish peanut butter pie dessert was amazing!"}
{"text":"Manager, a young adult that does not understand a lick of costumer service. This gentleman with brown hair and braces, has no inkling of what 'booking a section for a retirement party' means. He allowed guests to disrupt a retirement party while prancing around and pacing like a pony. Some leadership there.  Overall, this distasteful act left many within the party feeling unwanted and unwilling to give money to the establishment.   The food was mediocre at best and the drinks were overpriced, other than the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Exceptional service at the Miller Tavern this evening, we dropped in for Happy Hour which runs weekday evenings for 3+ hours. The happy hour menu includes a nice selection of aperitifs such as poutine w/ roast beef topping and other goodies.  The skilled staff here do a great job of making their patrons feel welcome which is why I'll return again and again."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place tonight! Have been here a few times but tonight the food and service were exceptional!  Howie was amazing ...try to get his section if you can. Came here for mothers day dinner and was not disappointed. They take care of you. They had a price fix menu for mothers day.i had the prime rib and it was delicious. The hawaiian tuna poke was tasty, the wine was fresh and the desert was a perfect ending to a perfect meal."}
{"text":"Today, my friend took me for a Birthday meal and we both ordered the Roast Turkey Dinner ($21/plate) off the Fall menu, since its Thanksgiving. We were very disappointed with the food. My friend, who's easy-going and non-picky said it was like a frozen TV dinner meal, that she's actually had better frozen turkey dinners. Her comments: the  white meat was tasteless, too thinly sliced and looked processed. Felt ripped off as there was no stuffing. Swiss Chalet would have been better.   My comments: how can you mess up gravy? Its just basically drippings and flour, but they managed to. My plate hardly had any gravy so I asked for extra and I got a thin, runny, salty brown liquid that was NOT turkey gravy. The 'seasonal' vegetables were sparse and bland, (My carrots were mostly raw and unpeeled... muddy veins... really??). The brown meat was not too terrible (the white was) but once I poured the salted-dishwater gravy over it, it was all ruined anyway. Cranberry was the only decent thing on that plate, but still  I regretted the entire meal. Had the Apple and Sour Cherry Crumble for dessert. The topping was nice, but the apples were the wrong kind i think and too sparse to be called apple crumble. Oh, and I found *one* sour cherry amidst the chintzy apples.  This was our first time eating at Miller Tavern and perhaps we expected too much, but we shall NOT be returning. The food was worth one star but I'm throwing in an extra star because our waiter was nice. He referred to the food as \"casual fine dining, one step above Jack Astors\". No, you're not. Jack Astors makes a wicked crumble.  I read some other reviews on here that said to just drink and not eat at Miller. Wish I read them before our ruined Birthday and Thanksgiving meal."}
{"text":"I'm torn, as the ambiance and feel are excellent.  However, my experience with the 2 cocktails I ordered was poor enough such that I had to switch back to Guinness with all haste.  Definitely comfortable and fun, great sense of what a pub ought to be like.  Pity that the mixed drinks didn't reach the same level of chic.  4.5 for ambiance 3 for the drinks."}
{"text":"Once again I'm astonished of how many people The Miller have working downstairs and yet can't provide a semblance of service. The people seem more interested in socialising rather than serving or cleaning, if you have time to lean then you have time to clean, our table was filthy and continued to be filthy even after being wiped down with what seemed to be water, no cleaning agent to be found . I hope they can get their act together because I like the place but if they continue doing this it will be a pass for me .  Regards Ray Ray"}
{"text":"I have been coming to The Miller for 6 years. I have never left disappointed. The place is a bit upscale but still low key. They have recently renovated their covered patio and its gorgeous. Its really nice at night as they keep it nice and warm. Perfect for a romantic dinner.  I have tried many things on the menu as they change it with the seasons. By far, my favorite thing is the Pad Thai and I'm very glad this has never been changed. It is great every time I get it. They have recently added a lobster cioppino which is by far one of the best I've ever had. The broth had a great flavour. You could tell it had a long cooking process as the lobster taste was so intense.  I could go on and on about all the other food and desserts that they have. For good service and great food, I would always recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was possibly the worst meal we have ever had. How the Miller Tavern can charge country club prices for cafeteria food is beyond me.  My father-in-law ordered the fillet minion, medium rare (for $49). What came out was an inedible, mangled piece of meat that was rare on the inside, yet still tough and grisly. Three of us tried it and agreed it was terrible. I actually think they took a poor quality cut of meat and pounded it with a meat mallet to 'tenderize' it, and disguised it as a fillet minion. Unacceptable, and borderline fraudulent in my opinion.   We alerted our server that the meat was tough and terrible, and he immediately took it off the bill. While we appreciate the gesture, we were surprised how quickly he removed the item, as though he had seen this kind of thing before.   We ordered bread that we had to pay for. It was clearly at least a day old, and the 'maple butter' had what tasted like icing sugar mixed into it, and nothing close to maple syrup. Why, just why?  We have no problem paying for good-quality, nourishing food. Unfortunately, the Miller Tavern only delivered on the high price-point, and nothing else."}
{"text":"Passed by this place a lot on yonge street so We decided to try it out. Pretty big place, outdated in its decor, mediocre service and food is ok. Tried their steak frites special which was advertised on the front door for $19.95.   Service - 3/5 Taste - 3/5 Portion - 4/5 Atmosphere - 2/5 Price - 3/5  Service - service was okay. Nothing over the top but also nothing bad that stood out either.  Taste - steak frites was ok. Was expecting smaller thiner fries and the steak was too salty.  Portion - regular sized portions. Nothing out of the ordinary.  Atmosphere - this place is very outdated in its design and their food playing was also absolutely lacking.  Price - price is around the same as keg so it not really priced at a low end here. Expect more for what we paid here."}
{"text":"$$$  This restaurant looks more like a country club or a golf club house just south of Yonge and York Mills. I was in the mood for a good steak house in the Willowdale area and this seemed like the best choice. So glad that I went.  The entrance is in the back and it has a HUGE parking lot. This is one of the better neighborhoods in Toronto and the buildings and houses in the vicinity reflect that.   I guess the restaurant also shares that with the demographic in the area- as the furniture and ambiance were excellent. The host greeted us, offered us our table and also insisted in taking our jackets to the coat room. She left a number tag in order for us to pick them up when we are done. Service! made us feel as distinguished and privileged as I possibly could in my Blue jays jersey and snap-back on. Balling!  The menu was interesting- like high end pub fare- maybe that's the difference between a pub and a tavern? Im making it up. I will google it:  \"The distinction of a tavern from an inn, bar or pub varies by location, in some places being identical and in others being distinguished by traditions or by legal license. In Renaissance England, a tavern was distinguished from a public ale house by dint of being run as a private enterprise, where drinkers were \"guests\" rather than members of the public\"  Ok- now we learnt something. or you skipped that part. Who cares. How was the steak you ask???  Smooth like butter- my steak knife danced thru the tender meat like a figure skater setting up for a triple axle. It was the perfect texture in my mouth and the Chimucchura (chutney like) complimented the meat perfectly. The lobster was amazing as well. It is definitely worth the $10.50 to add on.  I also tried the Seafood Platter Salad. Must try!!! As you get to try a lot of their seafood dishes/apps in one order. The crab cake and ahi tuna was phenomenal.   Overall- really enjoyed my stay.  They also had Hey Day beer on tap. Which tasted super great to accompany my meal.  Great Establishment- worth the money if you feel like spoiling yourself."}
{"text":"There are so few comfortable spots to relax drink and dine in the area. This is my go to place. Try the salads they are full of flavour and make for a light summer supper. There are plenty of choices when it comes to seating; the downstairs pub, outside ground level patio, upstairs inside or the upper covered patio.   You can go for apps and a drinks or a full on dinner. Free parking but you might have to jockey for a spot at busy times."}
{"text":"We came for Mother's Day brunch for their fixed price menu. It was $3 more than usual, apparently, due to it being Mother's Day. Their free parking lot was full at 11 am so we had to park in the paid one.  We were promptly showed to our table upstairs. We would have liked sitting on the patio, though. Anyway, our waitress was patient and came to us a few times while we looked over the menu. They give quite a lot of choices for the entrée, which I was happy about. For $30 per person, it isn't bad at all. The meal came with an alcoholic drink, bread basket, entrée, and dessert. We also had a 15% off coupon that we could use for the brunch that we got at a hotel somewhere.  Mimosa: this had quite a good portion of alcohol in it. Came in a skinny glass so probably didn't have much liquid in general, though.  Bread basket: came with a variety of breads / muffins / croissants. We would have liked 1 of each for each person. It was more like 2 of each except 1 croissant. There was butter and 3 types of jam on the table too.  Ravioli and poached egg: I decided to get this but kind of regret it after seeing the croissant sandwich entrée. It had two large ravioli on a bed of cooked spinach, with a poached egg on top covered in hollandaise sauce. There were two asparagus on the plate as well. The top was covered in a variety of fruits. The ravioli was very good, with mushroom on the insides. The spinach was cooked well. Asparagus was ok, mine were a bit thick/old. The egg was cooked nicely so that when cut, yolk ran out. Fruits were ok but I would have preferred salad.  Lemon parfait: this looked really pretty. I loved the meringue stick it was topped with. The layers were whipped cream, lemon custard, fruits, and sponge cake. It was quite a heavy dessert. The meringue was the best part!  When the waitress brought us the bill she forgot the 15% coupon, but she apologized politely and corrected the mistake.  The upstairs women's washroom is only 1 room, while apparently they had 8 stalls downstairs. Not the most women-friendly!  Overall it was a fun brunch. For $30 and 15% off, the multiple course meal with alcoholic drink is a pretty good deal. A good choice for Mother's Day brunch!"}
{"text":"Brunch is one of my favourite meals because there's nothing more comforting than French toast, eggs benedict, crepes and... well okay - I guess all brunch foods are comfort foods :p  Being a suburbanite we ventured up to Yonge/401 to have brunch at the Miller Tavern - a historic and quaint restaurant not too far from Auberge du Pommier (yet another quaint and homey restaurant).  They have a brunch prix fixe which consists of a breakfast cocktail (mimosa/bellini), a main and dessert for $27.  Non-alcoholic beverages are also an option if you don't want to be caught drinking before 11AM ;)  For those who can't stomach such a grandiose meal in the morning, you can always go the à la carte route.  We ended up doing one à la carte and one prix fixe and we left feeling pretty full.  The prix fixe starts off with a Brunch Pastry Basket filled with mini croissants, quick bread and muffins.  This is served with a trio of jams including: marmalade, raspberry and strawberry, perfect with the mini balls of butter that also come with.  I urge you to restrain yourself from eating the whole basket because the \"main\" attractions are worth the wait.  The Lobster and Shrimp Coddled Eggs was a bowl of buttery heaven which was made richer as you spooned into the egg yolks which intertwined in between chunks of lobster and shrimp.  The fruit is a nice side to tone down the richness of the dish.  And instead of your usual boring crumpet or English muffin, the Truffled Poached Eggs are served atop a mushroom ravioli and a delightful truffled Hollandaise sauce.  Delicious!  We finished off our leisurely brunch with the Apple-Cinnamon Butter Cake, served with a rum anglaise.  The texture reminded me very much of a bread pudding and we both agreed we would've liked to have seen a little more crème anglaise on the plate.  We sat on the veranda which is on the second floor overlooking the parking lot which let in a lot of natural lighting.  The atmosphere was very calm and relaxing and the service was great.  I've already booked a return visit for Mother's Day where they'll be featuring a $30 prix fixe, featuring a Lobster & Mascarpone Cheese Ravioli in a white wine and rosé cream sauce.  Other than that, the menu remains pretty much the same."}
{"text":"Had the prime rib dinner for two.  Very good and huge portion.  They served me the cut of meat I requested which i really appreciate."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner with a party of 8.   Food: Average quality (think Kelsey's or Swiss Chalet) for a premium price. Paid about the same at The Keg two days prior for much better fare.   Service: Server was inexperienced but did her best and was friendly and courteous at all times.  Atmosphere: I was amused to notice that most of the picture frames on the wall were crooked! No complaints however."}
{"text":"The Miller is a Toronto landmark. Most believe the tavern is run down and do not realize that a HUGE rennivation has made it a great restaurant and Pub. Excellent food and ambiance. The outside patio is delighfull."}
{"text":"Went here again recently.  I will give an updated star rating for the fantastic happy hour prices.  4.25 for a pint from some exceptional beers.  They also have these 4.25 samplers, which at 4.25 you can get 3x and they will fill you up.  I thought this was a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"Simple menu and reasonable prices compared to most steakhouses out here- it's a solid 3/5. There isn't much that stands out about this place, which is just fine!"}
{"text":"Terrible lamb burger, absolutely over priced, typical mediocre bar food. Thai beef salad was mediocre as well."}
{"text":"We had dinner here with a group of friends for a birthday function. I haven been here a few years ago and did not think much of the experience. The restaurant has improved. Between two people we ordered appetiter 'this and that', prime rib, filet chimichurri with added side of lobster tail. Appetizer was as expected and a good size for sharIng. Steaks were delicious and tender. Filet migwas very tender and chimichurri sauce done right not overly flavorful or salty. Had a cocktail 'a current affair' and we had red wine for the table. Dessert was a chocolate caramel banana combination with popcorn. Service was friendly and attentive, and the steaks a good size with generous sides. Overall great casual steak experience. Would come back again."}
{"text":"The location is great, the food is average and the service sucks! I ordered jerk chicken and it was just average or below average. It was over priced for sure. Let's talk about the service. The waiter never came to check if we still had any water, I asked once and the second time my fiance just went to grab the water for me. The waiter also told us he was looking for the dessert menu and after like 10 mins, he said he finally found one. But when he thought we were paying, he came right away without us looking for him. He even had the bill with him. However, we were not even done yet. Your service really sucks."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for oysters and great meat, if I don't want to go far.  Absolutely love the ambience on the ground floor, especially the booths by the windows.  Service is great, food is even better.  It's not cheap, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"What we got. A snarky, rude server who put his best efforts into spending the evening ignoring us.  It took almost an hour for our main courses to be served by which time we were starving, and the food was not worth the wait.  We gave the Miller Tavern tavern a S.T.O.O.L. rating (Scratch This One Off List)."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Some regulars (who identified themselves as such) were absolutely obnoxious and their behaviour was literally encouraged by some staff.  Management was aware and made zero effort to intervene --- seemed ok with a potential brawl, and made zero effort to make any positive contribution to crowd control."}
{"text":"I went here last year with my husband on Valentine's day to celebrate us just getting married the day before.  We had a very pleasant experience being seated upstairs.  We were given complementary amuse bouche, and a chocolate shot before dessert came.  We enjoyed the place so much we said we'd come back to celebrate valentine's day this year again and we did.  This year, after booking reservation a month ahead, and noting them that we were there to celebrate our 1st year wedding anniversary which was very significant to us, and to please seat us somewhere nice like last year, we ended up being seated right beside the bar, near the washroom.  When we first arrived, the host at the front didn't seem to care where to seat us (assuming she didn't read the note, or read the note and didn't care), and we were seated at a tiny little 2 person table in the middle of 2 rows of booths.  We felt like we were being put on display and it wasn't just us who felt the same.  The couple beside us who came first, also asked to be seated elsewhere and were moved to a booth on one of the rows.  I talked to the host, and told her that I made a note when I booked the reservation that we were there to celebrate our 1st year wedding anniversary, and that if it's possible to please seat us elsewhere.  She agreed, and had us end up at a booth - by the bar and washroom!  This was on the main floor by the bar, so it was very noisy - so much for a celebration.  We didn't want to seem anal and too difficult and ask to be seat elsewhere for the SECOND time, so we just stayed at the table and tried to enjoy the rest of the night.  The service was slow, but this was due to it being very busy (not the waiter's fault), but when the food finally came, it was good.  However, because we had to wait so long in between apps and entrees, we were too full to get dessert, and ended up leaving the night just like that.  This is actually a nice and big place, if you can get seated upstairs for a more quiet experience.  The food was good both times I went, but my biggest complaint was how we were treated/seated.  What's the point of booking a reservation a month ahead when I can't even get a decent table to celebrate a significant occasion??  The host needs to read the note more carefully and actually execute the seating arrangement to her best ability, instead of just shrugging us off and seating us somewhere crappy by the washroom (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"I ordered their steak frites and was not very impressed. Fries were mediocre at best and the steak was not great either. I asked for medium and it was unevenly cooked ranging from rare to well done. It was also very dry. Had an calamari appetizer which was satisfactory. At least the restaurant decor looks nice. Service was pretty average. Overall not a great meal and rather expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"I finally got the change to come here last week with a couple of co-workers for lunch. I've booked reservations at this restaurant for years but it's always been for someone other than myself.  It wasn't at all what I expected it to be. I found the decor to be a little 'dated' although I suspect they're trying to stick with the whole 'tavern' feel and for some reason, I was under the impression that the type of restaurant where you paid a lot and received not much more than an amuse bouche for as an entree. Not the case at all!  I ordered the turkey club with sweet potato fries. Roast turkey with peameal bacon, tomato, lettuce, Dijon mustard, lemon aïoli and apple & hazelnut slaw. Wow. Fantastic! The peameal bacon was such a nice addition and between that, the lemon aïoli and the slaw, it truly made this the best club I think I've ever had.  The service was great, the food was great and I now understand why so many people go here. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The Miller is cozy with lots of seating and gets quite busy during lunch. I sat in the upstairs terrance and enjoyed one of the few spots in the restaurant with natural lighting.   The Chicken Cobb salad has all the components of a good salad with fresh ingredients, complementary dressing (this one had a bit of a kick from a hint of mustard) and filled my tummy up. It hits the salad spot but at $20 pre tax and tip, it's ludicrous. If it wasn't on the company's tab I wouldn't pay out of my own pocket.  I much rather prefer the food court pumpernickel or fast fresh salads for under $12 but unfortunately there aren't many lunch options up near York Mills.  Service wise, the waitress took forever to come around to take our order and gave off the attitude that she didn't want to be there.  To sum up in Miller in one sentence: Steep prices for average food and below average service."}
{"text":"I've come here for drinks a couple of times and also brunch once. This time though came for dinner.  I had the Mushroom Ravioli which was decent. There were multiple pieces of mushroom was evident and the sauce was creamy but not too powerful. Overall a decent dish.  Their beer selection isn't overwhelming they have a range of standard beers plus some craft.  But looking up and down the menu, I just feel a bit underwhelmed by it all considering the price. It's interesting though the different vibe you get from downstairs to upstairs. Downstairs feels dark and corporate. Upstairs also seems a bit corporate in sections but it also feels more airy and open which I think is good. What would be fantastic is if they took the whole upstairs away and opened it up cause them they'd have those huge ceilings to look at. Maybe with a balcony on the perimeter.  I remember coming here for brunch once and had the croque monsieur. I think their brunch is delicious and definitely worth eating at."}
{"text":"Great location, great ambience! Nice street level view if you are sitting in the glass covered outside dining area  on the upper floor. We had tried Tale of Two Salmon and Centre Cut Sirloin Steak. Both tasted great. Service was just ok. Suggested minimum service charge was 18% - didn't quite matched the quality of the service though."}
{"text":"Awesome service paired with awesome food! Every time I go (which is at least 1-2 times a month) we're never disappointed food is outstanding, the filet mignon with mashed potatoes- to die for. The wine selection is out of this world..   A must go"}
{"text":"I really like the Miller. It feels like such an adult place, quite different from its glory days as Brunswick House of North Toronto of the 1980s. The interior is comfortable and classy, with a lovely fireplace in the winter. The bar is cozy as well, and the bar is well stocked with single malts and higher end liquors. You can watch as they shuck oysters at the bar, perhaps even onto a plate for you.  The patio is one of the better ones I've ever been on. It doesn't look like much from the street, but it descends down several levels, as the Miller is basically a backsplit building with multiple floors leading to the parking lot. The patio feels less like a bar patio and more like a deck in a wealthier friend's backyard. The lighting could be better--some corners are nearly completely dark--but perhaps that's what some patrons are looking for.  I haven't tried much of the food (I mainly go for cocktails), but what food I've tried has been tasty, though not inexpensive. The service has mainly been good, but slower on the patio where it can take longer to get a drink and you might have to ask more than once for water.  I've noticed that the clientele is higher end as well. Many Mercedes and BMWs in the parking lot, and lots of white teeth and sweaters tied around the shoulders inside. I was there with some friends on a Saturday night watching the game and several single women of slightly older vintage lined the bar. They added to what is a fun environment, without threat of frat kids looking to get bombed.  A comfortable place, if a little off the beaten path in the heart of Hoggs Hollow."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the quality of the food. And give me a break, frozen French fries that are mussy inside, c'mon!! Could get a lot better food elsewhere for a lot less money.  Servers are very good, place has character and a parking lot is out back."}
{"text":"The Miller Tavern uptown (which, once upon a time, was called the Jolly Miller) is kinda neat, insofar as it's a tavern (the bar area has lots of TVs to enjoy sports) but it's also a semi-upscale steakhouse, with a great big patio to boot.  My friend, a steak connoisseur who usually prefers the city's finest (Jacobs and Barbarians) actually rated his cut of meat a 3.5 out of 5....which I think is not too shabby for a place like the Miller!  We also tried French Onion Soup (it was okay...it had little bits of beef in it, which was different); calamari (quite good); mushroom ravioli (not bad); and seafood corn chowder (meh).  Service was warm. Cocktails were good. I give the Miller a solid 3 overall."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sirloin Steak 10 oz. ($25) with Nova Scotia Lobster Tail ($15) and Mashed Potatoes because it sounded very appetizing on the menu. I asked for medium rare steak and they cooked it exactly how I wanted it. The steak was very tender and juicy with the right amount of seasoning. The Nova Scotia Lobster was so succulent and delicious with a nice buttery taste. And the mashed potatoes were obviously yummy as well. My boyfriend ordered the same steak but with garlic shrimp and Caesar salad. I tried his shrimp and found them to be very absolutely divine because the shrimps were perfectly cooked and the garlic sauce was exquisite!  We both enjoyed our delicious meals and we also liked the quick service. I would recommend this restaurant to those that are looking for a great place to eat steak and seafood before a game or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Went with a big party. Most of my friends were less than satisfied with their meals.  I had lamb burger, which was ok. But it should be been better for $15. Others had various entrees.  Atmosphere was good, and the service was fine. But I don't really see what they're offering here considering the price point."}
{"text":"Our company had an Xmas dinner party here, and I've also had lunches and dinners here. I like the look and feel. Great patio too, somewhat hidden from busy Yonge Street. The food is still not great. Everything is quite mediocre yet expensive. A good chef can probably elevate The Miller to being a solid uptown option, but until then it's just another blah waste of stomach room."}
{"text":"Attended the retirement party and the regular crowd was very loud. When we spoke with the management they refused to address the situation. Regulars became louder, were very drunk continued to be served and this was after we arranged for the space and paid for it.  Appaling behaviour by the regular crowd and management. Disrespected by both. Take your business elsewhere. Worst evening in over 20 years."}
{"text":"Despite living nearby for over 10 years this is the first time I've been to the Miller Tavern. We went at 6:00pm for dinner and even though they couldn't find our reservation we were seated promptly on the closed-in balcony upstairs. The downstairs was a bit dark but it was nice and bright where we were sitting. It was also roomy and airy on the second floor. The place has a medium sized free private parking lot with a large GreenP lot adjacent to it. The server seemed genuinely concerned with our satisfaction.  I was actually impressed by the seafood salad ($23) which was mostly fish, shrimp, and a large crab cake rather than greenery with microscopic pieces of unidentifiable bits. The presentation was delightful and I found the portion size also to be just right. The calamari was also creatively plated and the steak and frites were yummy. I didn't have occasion to scope the bathrooms but the restaurant seemed clean in general. Overall our entire party really enjoyed it and I would go back again!"}
{"text":"We had Valentine's Day at the Miller. This place continues to deliver!  We had a nice table upstairs and the ambiance is relaxed. Allows for conversation without loud music dominating, and so made for a nice intimate meal.  We had steaks and a great bottle of pinot noir and the food was wonderful.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and came with loaded baked potatoes (you could have other sides if you wanted - vegetable, salad other type of potato).    We followed up with peanut butter pie which was great.  This is something not often seen in Canada, but was sooooo good.  Also, they gave us a $25 gift certificate to their new tavern on Bay Street because we booked online.  Nice perk!  We'll definitely be back and for those of you that want other options, there were many choices on the menu, Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you go there, order the Sirloin or the Prime Rib - they get good cuts of meat and they do them nicely.  That's about all I can praise. Don't order any main under $30, they don't bother much about it, and don't order anything with an ethnic flavor (Butter Chicken, Jerk, or Pad Thai ect...) it will be bland & whitewashed to the extreme - stick to White, North American staples (or \"senior's menu\" if you prefer,,,)  Visually it's a very appealing place, the Washrooms are great (with legit toilet paper not the translucent hospitality-grade junk) and the staff was courteous & attentive. However the very basic hard, flat wooden chairs were fairly punishing to sit on.   They brought us complimentary \"salads\" which could literally have fit into an empty egg shell. No biscuits or bread basket of any kind.    Could have done better for less money or much better for the same $$."}
{"text":"Came here for a working lunch meeting. I love their HUGE patio. Perfect for summer time and right by York Mills subway so super convenient. The restaurant offers plenty of indoor and outdoor seating options and the setting is nice. Kind of takes you away from the busy city life and into some relaxing place.   Ordered the Miller burger which was big and tasty but SUPER GREASY. No jokes. And does not come with any sides.. no fries for me =( Also got a bev and total order came to be $28. Not cheap for lunch."}
{"text":"LIke the guy on the TV commercial says: \"save your money!\"  Me and a friend ordered clam / shrimp chowder to start.  A small \"miso\"-sized cup was 6$.  I sent mine back because it was so salty that it was like drinking sea brine.  The chunks of seafood in it were pulverized and unrecognizable (no whole shrimps, etc.).  My friend ordered a single oyster for $4.50.  It was a great oyster but more expensive than Rodney's?!?  Presented on ice in a metal martini glass with fresh horse-raddish, seafood sauce and wedge of lemon.    My main was a Pad Thai dish for $21.00.  An overcooked shrimp as garnish.  I think there may have been some ketchup in the pad thai sauce mixed with coconut milk and some spice?  Notable absence of thai mint which (along with coconut) are standard for classic character but this version had no fusion concept to replace what was missing...  Good \"quantity\" of seafood and large serving overall.  The cashews were not crunchy but stale.  My friend ordered a rare filet mignon which came medium.  No complaints, standard fare overall (in the neighbourhood of $40.00).  Dessert for me was a $12.00 berries with grand marnier which did not come with Grand Marnier but rather a home-made sugar syrup (sugar + water) as it was clear and colourless, sweet and flavourless.  There was a good helping of unexpected whipped cream (not from the can but the real deal).    The espresso was great and the service was fast and friendly.  A good place to go for a drink but not a good dinner spot on a Monday at least.    I came here with a friend last night (Monday night) so it may be the case that the A team wasn't on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I give this a 3-Star cause I had only h'orderves. I thought the appies were just average. They had chicken skewers, spring rolls, mini roast beef sandwiches, etc. None of it really thrilled me & put a smile on my face. I'm sure the menu is decent but I didn't try it. Maybe a do over but I would break my neck getting there."}
{"text":"I can't believe this hasn't been reviewed yet! I love the Miller, and I don't think I'm the only one - since its always packed when I go there.   Even for lunch during the week you should make reservations in advance. I went without reservations and my small group got \"stuck\" on the patio. This turned out to be amazing - because their patio is awesome, and very, very large. It was also a beautiful day outside, which never hurts.   The Miller Tavern might have served me the best food I've ever tasted in my life. I know, it sounds extreme but the menu is to die for. It is hard to make a decision because everything is so great. I don't know one person who hasn't absolutely loved their meal there.   I've been for dinner and lunch. Both times have excellent service, even though they were very busy. I hear the \"Comfort Foods\" section of the menu is the best - I ordered the Beef Tenderloin Cavatappi off of this once and it was amazing. The beef was cooked to pefection. They do specialize in seafood, complete with an oyster bar, but you can get all kinds of cuisines here. I've had dessert here as well, and was very impressed with the creme brulee.   They have a great selection of wine and a full bar. I love the atmosphere indoors, as well.   This place is great for dates or even company parties. I would recommend The Miller Tavern to anyone.  Lunch is about $20-30 and Dinner is more like $40-50 per person."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit for birthday or some other special occasion. Have been coming here from 2007 - their desserts are amazing, also the main dishes are pretty good. I do think that the prices are little too high, but the restaurant is very beautiful and I love the vibe there. This restaurant is great to celebrate birthday or anniversary. But too pricey for regular visit. My photos attached are not from this year, they might decorate their desserts in different style now."}
{"text":"Came here in the cold months so I cannot comment on their patios.  We had a dinner here and as expected, it is pricy.The service was just excellent & our waitress was very attentive.   Food wise, this honestly isn't for me as I'm not that into steak. So I ordered the grilled salmon ($24). Parsnip potato puree (like a mash), seasonal vegetables, mushrooms and dijon cream sauce. It was quite filling!   We also had some appetizers. such as the calamari (I think it could've been crispier. Not a fan of this) & the This & That platter. The garlic shrimp in the platter was excellent. The rest were just as expected/average. Maybe you can skip out appetizers  :)   We were here for a birthday. Please note, if you want to bring in a cake, they will charge each slice $2 even though u brought in the cake yourself."}
{"text":"I went there with my parents about 2 weeks ago, and considering how it's presented as an upscale restaurant, I expected a lot better. The decor is outdated. The first floor is half bar, half seating. The second floor is all dinner seating, which is where we were put.  The hostess was nonchalant, ignorant about everything pertaining to the restaurant, and not very concerned about our reservation. I don't know why we had to wait since we went on a Monday and it was practically empty.  First thing, my father brought a bottle of nice wine to open for the meal. The server broke the cork, did not apologize, and just went to get another server. They didn't offer anything, and there was remnants left in the bottle. Poor service. Poor skills.  Second, they got our orders wrong twice. My father had to send back his steak twice because he ordered a filet mignon, but got a sirloin, The following time, they got his side order wrong. Wtf is wrong with this restaurant, especially when it was not busy at all?  The food was okay, like any steakhouse. I ordered the seafood pad Thai. My mother had the shrimp fettuccine. It was fine, but I could find that kind of food at a Jack Astor's and have better service.  I am angry because I spent good money there, and the service was horrible, and they did not offer any apologies or admit wrongdoing. I definitely will not be going back there."}
{"text":"We go for happy hour which is until 6 pm on weekdays. Nice patio if you can get a spot.   The banana caramel crunch dessert was disappointing ($9) but the server suggested I go with the toffee pudding. Regret!   The happy hour bites for $5.50 are small but tasty. I like the Thai steak lettuce wrap (you get 2). The prime rib slider was a 3/5 (happy hour portion).   We would come back for the patio and happy hour."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day brunch on May 10, 2015.  Got the prix fixe deal for $35 per person. Usually prix fixe deals are a rip off as you don't get too much food. I was pleasantly surprised at the quantity and the food was great.  To start off we got a sparking wine drink which was complimentary. We also got a bellini which was part of menu. They were both good.  I had the crab cake benedict. The crab cake was good with lots of veggies and crab meat. The poached eggs came on a biscuit. I LOVED the biscuit it was flaky and buttery and the hollandaise sauce had great flavour and was very buttery which I loved. In addition to this we got a little basket of poppy seed bread and 2 mini cranberry muffins with butter and two types of jam. I enjoyed the poppy seed bread.  There were 5 choices for dessert but unfortunately I was too full and opted out.   Coffee and tea was also included.   I loved the atmosphere and they have a lovely upstairs patio. I will definitely go back one evening for drinks."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: The Miller is on my family's Friday Night Delight shortlist of restaurants. The FND Shortlist began once the junior members of said family left home; and, working downtown and relying upon public transit, realized that traditional home-cooked family dinners would pose a greater challenge.  Massive renovations a few years ago transformed the former dive bar into an upscale cottage; a theme that carries through the Miller's marketing efforts. The room is all blond wood and big banquets; a comfortable spot that meets the needs of midtown's graying, ass- spreading crowd. Downstairs, upwardly-mobile 30 year olds jockey at the bar and down first-rate burgers. Upstairs, an older crowd opts for more expensive plates, although both share space on a recently-pruned menu.  Speaking of the menu, it used to be a multi-page affair, with separate editions for lunch and dinner, upstairs (upscale chop/fish house) and downstairs (high-end bar food). Perhaps because of the recession, these divides have been broken, and the Fall of the menu Wall means a single placemat-sized page, in smaller font, behind a plastic shield. It's a smart move, but older diners pull out reading glasses and struggle to angle the card, so the plastic doesn't catch light and obscure the dish descriptions.   For the seafood-inclined, an array of oysters promise that you'll meet your recommended daily zinc/aphrodisiac allowance. The bivalves are fresh and briny, although I miss the old 'shooter' option. Also, where'd the cheddar jalapeno biscuits go? At it's best, the Miller was the platonic ideal of red lobster. And I mean that in a good way.   Soups usually include a vegetable and a seafood option. I skip vegetable soups for the reason that most critics avoid salads. Root vegetables are dirt cheap, and I refuse to pay $8 for parsnips, carrots, celery root or anything that comes within spitting difference of mirepoix, no matter how much cumin you wave at it. I gladly defer to chef's tastes, but this is really food that I can make at home. I've encountered scores of chowder variations over the years; all rich with seafood and fragrant with fresh herbs and wine. Caesar salad properly balances fresh, cool dry lettuce and clingy garlic-charged dressing. The addition of quebec blue cheese adds umami punch. Various spring rolls arrive hot and crisp, in huge portions that demand sharing. A pair of shrimp-and-crab cakes should also be shared, but between it's crispy exterior and sweet melting seafood, greed may indeed be good.   A whole section of the menu is devoted to burgers, beef and otherwise, all sided with serviceable slaw and regrettably frozen fries. At $15-20 a burger, one wishes that the kitchen could show the same attention to this part of the meal as it does with its creative selection of patties and fixin's. Sadly, the Miller's fries are outclassed by the Pilot's, Caplansky's and the Stockyards, all of which offer comparable burgers at lower prices. That said, a substituted blue cheese Caesar or cheddar-laced potato cake from the steak portion of the menu turns one's attention elsewhere.  Mains change seasonally, as pointed out on the Miller's website, on the menu, on the postings on your way into the restaurant, by the wait staff, the cooks, the dishwasher, the couple at the next table, and by the drunken girls giggling on the subway on my way home, and I swear by Lloyd Robertson on the 11;00 news.  Still, steaks are a constant; tender if grilled a step or two beyond requested temperature. A colossal shrimp offered to surf one's turf is a worthwhile investment. Crisp univeg accompanies the options, along with a choice of damnable fries, herbed mash or the aforementioned cheesy, steroidal latke. All well done, but lacking the pizazz of the less formal options, or the refinement of the range of fish and seafood dishes, including a boulliabaise-style halibut; seared scallops or grilled salmon. Each fish preparation rates its own sides. Most of these incorporate some asian elements. At their best, they play off the superior freshness of the fish, which seems to be sustainable as well.   Service is friendly and gracious to a fault. Repeat customers are acknowledged and the team works to ensure everyone leaves the table happy. Occasionally, happy extras find their way to the table. Coffee is poured hot and strong. I rise from my seat with a full belly, relaxed and ready to dive into the weekend."}
{"text":"Came last night with my parents and sisters. I enjoyed our dinner here. It was very busy and everyone looked happy to be there! We ordered drinks then appetizers then mains. For appetizers our table had: 2 French onion soups, seafood chowder, beet salad & calamari. My sisters had the onion soups and said they changed the recipe (they go to Miller tavern often) and now it's much better!  The beet salad was really good and a perfect portion. For mains, chicken curry, two filet mignons, ribeye steak and salad. I wish the salads were a bit bigger. The steak sides are very good. Overall, a good restaurant in midtown Toronto! Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"You have to try their 1lb lobster quesadilla at lunch time on a weekday. Although there wasn't much service, it's still \"enough\" service for such a busy lunch hour.  Their serving platters are so contemporary that my guacamole and sourcream couldn't stay on the plate."}
{"text":"This is another review for my absolute great experience with Miller Tavern. I brought my friends here for  Sunday brunch and we all got Steak and eggs with desserts (apple cinnamon and creme brule). The steaks were cooked to perfection and we loved the desserts. Our server was the most entertaining and nicest person. My friends loved my suggestion and we had a wonderful time together. I look forward to celebrating more occassions again at Miller Tavern."}
{"text":"Great patio  7/10 crab cakes (fresh and good size, but undercooked)  2/10 French onion soup (too much cheese, not enough broth, very bland)  8/10 oysters (good taste but very small, overpriced for size) 5/10 swordfish tacos  8/10 for steak salad. Great steak, but not enough things other than lettuce in salad.   Service was Mediocre.   A few small changes to food quality and service would bump this up to a solid 4/5 restaurant."}
{"text":"Service is great and location is good but the food is horrible and they either need a new menu or new cooks. So much potential with a great patio. Also over priced. Management needs to take a deep look"}
{"text":"Miller Tavern has the best patio in the area! Having a drink here surrounded by all the trees and plants made me feel like I am up North chilling in Cottage Country!  The cocktail specials though amazingly priced but they were disappointingly weak. Berry Pom Fizz ($3.95) tasted like sparkling water and Pitcher of Red Sangria ($19.95) tastes like juices.... I suggest stick with the $3.95 Corona instead, at least it tasted like a Corona?!  The food though is really good as I shared:  Charcuterie Board ($14) - cured & smoked meats, house made pâté, mustards, pickles, and bread  While I nibbled off from my friend's:  Calamari ($14) - lemon mustard aïoli, chilies and Shrimp Cocktail ($16)  Service was not the greatness this time.... our waitress was a little cold but I was too busy having a great time with my fellow yelpers to notice.  I will be back again to chill on the patio... with a bucket of Corona? maybe?"}
{"text":"WOW!! Wow to an amazing patio that made me feel like I am at a first class resort.  Intimate and cozy. Wow to an amazing afternoon menu promo where you get drinks and bites for just under $6.  The catch is, you have to take advantage of this deal between 2 - 6 PM.   Wow to their peppercorn steak with mushrooms.  Beautiful medium rare.  Succulent and melts in your mouth. Wow to their lovely service.   Wow to free parking. Just WOW!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm landing on a 3.5 for this one. Had a problem deciding between the two but then thought, when would I realistically come back again? and since the answer was probably not in a long time, I settled for a 3.  This place has always been somewhere I've been meaning to try. I am physically reminded of this place on a regular basis since I live further up in North York and drive past Miller regularly.   What Miller has going for the restaurant, is that it is in a great location. Decor/menu/price/quality-wise, I'd probably compare it to one of the chains (Moxies, Baton Rouge...) and food-wise, it only scores a little better.   We went on a Saturday night and found the crowd to be in the 50-60 age range. I think that sums up the place pretty well though. It's a place that hasn't changed much, has been there for a long time, and doesn't look like it'll change in a while."}
