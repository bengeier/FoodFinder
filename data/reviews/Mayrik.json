{"text":"Visited on a Saturday evening.  We really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant and the service was great!  The dumplings were incredible and the cocktails were also good but unfortunately the main meal was underwhelming. We had the chicken which was burnt and not well seasoned and the cauliflower and potatoes as sides (both were good but again, nothing special). We would return but only for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"If you're expecting traditional Armenian food, you may be a bit disappointed (according to our friends). However we really enjoyed our meal. The dips were average but we loved the fatoush salad, lamb and chicken. Amazing riff on baklava to end the night."}
{"text":"Outstanding ARMENIAN/ middle eastern food. Great ambiance. Very attentive staff. Will be coming back many times."}
{"text":"An uptown restaurant with downtown prices. Service is friendly and decor is attractive. Mains are served without accompaniments so you must order your veggies or starches separately.  In general found the food good quality in terms of ingredients but underwhelming when it comes to flavoring. Tried the mante baked dumplings filled with beef but with no spices detectable in the meat filling itself.  All the flavor comes from the garlic sauce that it's baked in.  Grilled fish $32 was perfectly cooked with minimal flavoring. 4 Lamb chops cooked exactly as ordered $34 with a garlic sauce on top. No bread is served at the table if you don't order dips and it is charged as an extra for $5.  When we entered the resto on a cold night, the host did not offer to hang up our coats even though there is a wall coat rack for that purpose, a strange oversight for a resto trying to be upscale. For the prices charged I think you can find better and more flavorful food at places like Tabule."}
{"text":"Food, ambience, value: 4-4.5/5  Service: 3.5-4/5 (lower score because mains can take a while on a busy night, even though Service is friendly & helpful)  Everything is delicious. We ordered beef tartare, babaganoush, cauliflower and rib eye.  Repeat: Certainly. One of our favourite middle eastern restos in general (i.e. anywhere)."}
{"text":"One of my most favourite places! A very classy and wonderful ambience as soon as you walk in combined with excellent food and wine!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! WOW! Every dish was delicious! The Greek spin on the grilled corn was superb. The steak, the green beans... wow! Our server Aaron was Infirmed and delightful, and Chef Seb came out and personally to describe the dishes to us and thank us for coming."}
{"text":"I'm gonna get straight to the punch line - hands down the best lamb chops in TO!  Now that we've got that outta the way, over to the other goodness in store here: a short menu with enough options to exercise your choice with ease than pages to be overwhelmed by.  Every item on the menu (incl. the cocktails) brings a burst of flavour. Amongst other must-haves are the roasted cauliflower (w/pearls of pomegranates and pine nuts) and the refreshing fattoush. Apart from good wine paired with the chops, the Mayrik signature cocktail is delicious and a must try for its kick of pepper!   The place has a relaxed vibe. It's suitable for a date or just hanging out with friends (especially on the patio). I liked that it wasn't too loud, which made it a great spot for good conversation. The staff is very courteous and knowledgeable. I was extremely happy with the entire restaurant experience - enough to share that:  - this was my second time (the first time I was much in awe of the food to take pics. I was busy relishing each bite)  - apparently they have a brunch menu (see attached pic) which looks phenomenal! Can't wait to try and review that.   For now, give this a go - it's worth it!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I enjoyed a meal so full heartedly or planned my immediate next visit. I had heard the food was good here, but always a skeptic I needed to eat to believe! And the hype is well earned! We had the Mante (Armenian meat dumplings) which could have been a meal unto itself. Delicious. The Fatoush salad was seasoned differently than expected but still yummy. The Mis (meat) was done well and serving was generous. Same for Hav (chicken) it's a half chicken so sharing a must. Didn't get dessert. Prices are fair for quality and serving - - will return. It's beyond busy on a Saturday night and so noise is high - but no complaints there. A must-visit!"}
{"text":"As regular visitors to Armenia, my wife and I were happy to find an Armenian restaurant in Toronto while visiting for business. It's a bit outside of downtown, but WELL worth the trip.   Mayrik takes Armenian food and brings it to the next level. Traditional dishes are given a modern twist, leaving you surprised and delighted with each course. Everything knocked our socks off, and this is from two people with a deep connection to the cuisine!  The staff is also amazing. The owner is very knowledgeable and willing to talk to you in detail about his restaurant. They clearly take pride in making this a fine establishment. Be sure to visit whether you live in Toronto or are visiting!"}
{"text":"Unusually delicious Armenian/Middle Eastern food. The meats (chicken, lamb) were are all unimaginably tender and delicious. Mediterranean grill done perfectly. Everything is made from scratch in house, and you can tell. The kibideyé (specially prepared minced raw beef) was some of the best I've had. The freshness of the ingredients combined with the love required to prepare good Armenian food makes this place really stand out. The bread is made to order, and the babaghanoush compliments it perfectly.   The staff was wonderful. Very friendly and attentive. Suggested we try Takar, a beautifully balanced Armenian wine.  Overall, 5/5 experience. Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this gem tonight on the recommendation of friends and it was excellent. The food was delicious. If you want to try brilliantly prepared delicacies that you won't find just anywhere, then you should try this place. I had lamb dumplings with mint and yoghurt and my wife had beef tartar.  We are going back soon"}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal at Mayrik.  Consistently great service, great food, never disappoints!  Keep up the great work guys, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of Toronto's must go to restaurants!  The food is incredible, the staff professional and the overall atmosphere is amazing.  I've been here twice, The first time I thought maybe it was a beginners luck and maybe since it's new that the food is good and the second time it was confirmed that their food is actually that good.  It's very difficult to pick one mane dish to recommend but if I really had to, it would probably be the octopus. It's to die for. There are not very many chefs in Toronto that can cook an octopus like this one here."}
{"text":"Let me say at the outset I grew up on Lebanese food, so I am biased to flavours I'm accustomed too!   Mayrik is a very good restaurant! There are some standout components. First and foremost the service was fabulous! The consensus was that the bread and two of the dishes were really excellent. The fatoush and the roasted cauliflower , superb.. The baba ganoush had a wonderful texture but it had a sweetness to it  that we didn't love. Mante dumplings were tasty, but I was terribly disappointed to discover the kibbeh nayeh was made with beef and not lamb. The lamb chops were also OK but nothing I can't make myself at home. The wine being Armenian was foreign to me, it was fine but not for $60. Unfortunately not much else to choose from on the wine list. We also found a $200.00 total was a bit much. The overall environment is crisp, clean and comfortable. So I say give it a try, I know you will enjoy your meal and it may suit your palate perfectly!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic dinner at Mayrik! I would say this is definitely not traditional homey Armenian food. They are creative and created all authentic dishes with a twist. Try the cauliflower and the hummus. Service was friendly and they have a fantastic cocktail menu. It is a little on the pricey side but worth it!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best meals I've ever had. Totally worth the commute! Zen is a wonderful chef and so young... what a talent. Aaron was an amazing server. So smart and so wonderful."}
{"text":"Such an original and authentic place, it is totally unpredictable, full of surprises. The room is small but intimate, the service is quick and efficient. The food quality is a solid 4/5, the cocktails can be worked on a bit more. The owner is super nice, the food was quick to arrive. Everything was served just like they should be. Our salad was so refreshing with fresh foraged wild herbs and unusual ingredients. The beef tartar with bulgur was so mild I could hardly taste the raw beef, it was simply delicious. The manti dumplings were not bad although they were far from being juicy. They probably could use a bit more yogurt sauce. The spreads were very good. We ordered two different cocktails and they were okay but nothing great. The restaurant was nice and clean. The parking situation can be a pain; so just be aware of it. You may need reservations if you go during weekends. I've been told that it is a fusion of Armenian, Greek and middle eastern food. Very creative menu!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this middle eastern restaurant! It`s so good!!  This place is tapa style, you order a couple dishes and share it with the table. If you don`t have any background knowledge in the food from the area, you`ll probably have difficulty knowing exactly what you`re ordering.   Food looks pretty simple, they aren`t going to serve it to you with the fancy French designs that you don`t want to ruin. It`s straight up food in a bowl or plate. Although I did find them to be on the saltier side, everything we ordered were so delicious. They also had wine from the middle east, which I never even heard of. You can tell a very distinct difference between them and a Cali or Italian wine.  Our server, and everyone else was eager to explain just about everything, or just checking up on the table. Fantastic service and food."}
{"text":"Order a side of cauliflower with mains lamb & chicken. Food was great. Would definitely visit again. Our server Shane was excellent, very welcoming & informative. Only downside was the chicken is cooked fresh & so it took a while to come. Rating 4.5/5."}
{"text":"I was so hopeful for this restaurant ... with very positive yelp reviews and listings in best new restaurants, I would think this be as good as Tanto or Bar Sybanne.  I'm not sure if it's a case of a bad night with poor service and missed dishes or \"the emperor has no clothes\".  I honestly feel a 3 Star is on the generous side for my experience.  Before I dive into the review, I do have to wonder why Mayrik refuse to put up a menu... even if its a sample one (like Buca) when their menu changes often.  It just helps so much.  In Leaside, Mayrik sits on a nice quiet street with many other small restaurants and boutiques.  I feel Mayrik is a little different as it has more of a modern edge with a feel that normally you'd see on King St.  It's mostly white walls are accented by interesting tiles framing the open kitchen and charcoal woods.  If you're a party of 2, expect to be jostled since you're awkwardly sat in the walkway right beside the tables along the wall.  I've seen the staff and other patrons constantly hit the tables.  If you're sat along the wall, it's better but there still isn't a lot of space.    One thing that stands out immediately is the staff... we easily counted 7 people on the floor from the hostess to the servers.  For a smaller restaurant, this was a surprise.  Tanto only had 4 and service was impeccable.  Bar Sybanne maybe had 3 and it was still very strong.  Here ... it was really lacking.  From the moment we sat to the moment we asked for the bill... we constantly waited, made eye contact with every service person, and waited some more.  I've never seen 5+ people totally and actively ignore a table clearly ready to capture someone's attention.  I do feel with such a heavy staff, service should have been one of the best in the city instead it's one of the unfortunate worst in the past year.  I did read a bit about Armenian cusine and they said they use more fresh herbs in addition to garlic and salt to season.  In our dishes, everything except the soujouk tasted muted and underseasoned.  I'm not sure what went wrong but flavours seemed lacking.    Babaghanoush - a different and interesting take on the traditional eggplant mezzo dip.  Instead of puréed, it is mashed so it leaves more of the eggplant soft and intact.  The flavour was muted and quite subtle... almost feel like it was under seasoned.  The one frustration is that they give you a sizeable portion with a tiny warmed up flat bread.  It's the size of a tea cup plate.  We maybe only ate 40% before running out of bread ... if you want another tiny bread, it's $5 extra. My rec is to either give another bread so the table can eat most of the dip and reasonably charge for the extra bread ($13 for dip and 3 tiny breads seem much) or reduce the dip amount to suit the bread size and reduce the cost.  3/5  Mante dumplings - we had similar looking ones at Byblos but Mayrik ones are quite different.  These dumplings do not have a supple thin wrapping.  They're quite heavy and bready.  They cradle a drier meat (seems like beef) that was more similar to a dry burger patty.  Though it had yogurt and dried spices dashed on top, this too seemed under seasoned and very subtle in flavour.  It just tasted like a bready mini dry burger.  It was missing the bold flavours we've had previously at Byblos.  2/5  Soujouk sausage -  the only dish of the night to have a flavour that captured our interest.  The sausage and stewed (braised?) tomatoes had a good spice kick that balance on sweet, lightly tangy, and flavourful spice.  It did come with a tiny bread again ... definitely not enough to eat all the tomato that comes with it.  4/5  Qarnabit roasted cauliflower - I've seen this at Fat Pasha and a few other places.  This one was ok... with the roasting, it added a nice nuttier flavour to the vegetable but I felt the stem was still very hard to cut into and not quite cooked through.  Though it supposed to have garlic, cheese, and cilantro on top, the flavour was not coming from them but only mostly from the roasting.  2/5  Fasolia green beans - green beans in tomatoes, garlic, and shallots.  These green beans were quite al dente... id say they were lightly blanched.  I'm not sure if it was intended that way but what happens then the beans don't absorb any flavour ... they had none of the tomato taste.  So it just tasted like plain raw beans.  I like vegetables but I know a lot of people would like seasoned vegetables at least.  3/5  One thing I didn't like so much was the staff offering extra bread as if on the house and never mentioning it was $5 extra.  We had to double check before the brought it out to see if it was an additional cost.  Just seemed a little underhanded.    I feel if you want a great night out for Mediterranean food, Byblos and Bar Sybanne offer wonderful flavours and service.  I just feel Mayrik had the popular crowded atmosphere but missing in delivery of taste and service.  Don't let the hype fool you ... like it did to me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things when I eat out is going to a restaurant that has a short menu and not many confusing options and that is what this has, very specific items that helps you decide what to order. Very good place to hang out with friends or have a work/meet dinner or a family gathering. Lamp chops are a must to try, and the cawliflour is very flavorful, the other dish that is must to try is the dumplings, amazing.  Staff are very friendly and they make you feel that you know them from before, and makes you feel that you are sitting at home amd not in a restaurant.  Too bad I didn't take pictures of my orders to post here but I was too busy eating. Highly recommended to try."}
{"text":"Amazing food, fantastic service, beautiful space.   Stand outs: beet salad, lamb chops, hummus and dumplings (sorry, can't remember the traditional names on the menu). I'd pass on babaganoush - (not creamy and garlicky as I like it).   Rose wine was a big hit as was the cocktail special (puréed peaches, gin and elder flower liquor....psst, I despise gin but loved the drink.) Props to the bartender for mixing it as it was meant to be and not substituting vodka as I originally asked.   I will be returning soon for sure. So happy that this awesome place opened up in my 'hood!!"}
{"text":"Armenian/Turkish style food that was tasty but not spectacular and not earned the extra price tag. Between the 4 of us we had most items on the menu. Mussels were big but slightly too fishy tasting so im not sure about freshness. The fish dishes came out quite a while after all the sides and other dishes and then came cold. The prices for the mains do not include  sides. The brandy orange cocktail was nice. Brussel sprouts and potato dish was also very good."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Mayrik is restaurant in the Leaside area serving up Armenian, Greek and Lebanese cuisine. Chef Yacoubian's vision is on having people eat the way he did growing up - meaning lots of shared plates over wonderful conversation. The menu recently changed and I got a chance to try some of their new plates.  The Kibbeh Nayeh ($16) is a traditional Lebanese mezze. Beef tartar is seasoned with lemon, green onions and Armenian pepper paste. The beef tartar was tender and the seasoning made it quite savoury and tangy with just a slight bitter aftertaste. The puffed bulgur added a nice texture to the dish. The tartar was accompanied with warm, house made bread. A very good dish.  The Byureg ($14) was absolutely spectacular. The flatbread was wonderfully doughy and chewy and was topped with akawi and haloumi cheese, mint, dill and pickled shallots. The result was an exquisite blend of cheesey, tangy and herby flavours rolled into one bite. I loved that everything was perfectly balanced with none of the flavours overpowering the other. If eating here, please order this!  The Bardez ($14) is another item new on the menu. Made with a mix of wild oregano, wild leeks, green onion, pickled red onions, turnips and chickpeas, it had a fresh herby flavour with a slight acidity to it but didn't seem very special. The chickpeas did add a nice crunch to the salad though.  We also ordered the Tsoug ($32). The fish was a Greek Mediterranean white fish which was grilled whole and then butterflied head to tail, after which it was de-boned and it and dressed in olive oil and zaatar. The fish itself was mediocre - a little on the dry side and did not have a fresh fish flavour - but it was wonderfully seasoned. The zaatar gave it a woodsy, herbal, citrusy flavour and the pickled beets that were paired with the fish also added some flavouring. It was ok but I would probably order something else the next time.  If you're looking for something different, Mayrik is a great choice. The restaurant has an elegant downtown vibe to it and is an excellent addition to the Leaside area. Service was fabulous and overall, food was good, albeit a little more expensive than I'm used to for Mediterranean. The Mante dumplings were sold out when I visited but I am very interested in coming back to try this Turkish staple."}
