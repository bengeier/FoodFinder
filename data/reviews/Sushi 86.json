{"text":"I am from out of town & just happened to stumble upon this dope little sushi spot with a coworker. The place was super clean and I automatically felt a great vibe when I walked in. The sushi & salad was delicious and the staff really seems to know their stuff. I  wish I could remember my servers name but she kept me smiling and answered any question I threw her way. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"First note..I never complain about service or any restaurants food quality because it's not my style and understand because I am in the service industry. It was a busy Saturday night because of the elite 8 was in cleveland ....but no excuses!!!   Loved the modest feel of a small sleek Asian - American spot ..where was the staff? Waiting 30 mins for a greeting not knowing if we ordered at the sushi bar or what ..very confusing  We waited 30 mins just to get our sake when ordered ...the service was mayhem with nothing being accomplished ..Our group ordered 6 rolls which I dont think was a huge order by any means About an 45 mins passed by and we were brought miso that we had not a clue why we were even given it ..not very well balanced and was very salty and don't get me wrong I love great miso.  About 15 mins later rolls were on the table that were sloppy, falling apart and not well crafted.  The sashimi was on point but u asked for yellow fun and yellow tail arrived instead..it was clean and fresh ..but they lacked details ...one of our guests asked for spicy mayo on the side and it didn't even arrive until 5 mins after we had all finished up....I don't understand at all ..how this disaster is rated so high .  When recieving our checks the server asked how was the service was? Once again I don't complain ever ..this is the first review I've ever written, but come on really ..I was mind blown ..I didn't say a word ..but one guest said it was very slow ...and they charged us for the side of spicy mayo we didn't use, which obviously wasn't the end all be all but took it off at the end .  I heard so many great things and reviews about sushi 86 ..and was let down beyond imaginable by a huge disaster.  I am not trying to be harsh, I'm in the industry and very much against yelp..take the constructive criticism and enhance a diamond in the rough to encourage what potential this truly could have"}
{"text":"For a dowtown Cleveland sushi spot without all the frills this one is a gem.  I would normaly stop in with friends for lunch and get some good stuff.  Had the opportunity to eat dinner there tonight and took my son (11).  We had time to relax and enjoy our time..  squid salad, miso soup and two rolls.  Perfect for a meal.   Under $35 and we were all good...The fish was fresh and very good portions we had good service."}
{"text":"We ordered a bunch of food delivered to a nearby hotel and the sushi was still awesome."}
{"text":"Quality sushi at fair prices. Modern restaurant in a cute shopping center right in the center of the city. Service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi place in Cleveland.  I've been coming here since they were on Ontario years ago.  Clean, fresh, delicious.  I've never been disappointed or underwhelmed. The food and service is the best!    Crab Salad Roll FTW.   (Sushi 86 should get a Lakewood location!)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in the city! I don't declare myself to be a sushi aficionado like many but I know good food when I taste it. I decided to try this place about 6 months ago and fell in love with the freshness of the sushi and how nice the staff is to their customers. Ever since then I've been a repeat customer. It's not exactly the cheapest place but you get what you pay for here. Top of the line sushi!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Sushi 86!! So happy they have a whole vegetarian menu because good veggie sushi is so hard to find, but this was great! We got the sampler and enjoyed all the flavors, sweet potato especially! The seaweed salad and miso soup were also delicious. Our waitress was very helpful and informative, especially since this was my first time having sushi. Can't wait to return the next time I'm in Cleveland. Highly recommend for herbivores and carnivores alike!!"}
{"text":"Hate to be the naysayer here, but I did not have a good experience when I stopped in for lunch last week. First things first -- I did like the all-white decor and the plating, etc. is funky and cute. However, the first thing I noticed when I walked in was a funky -- and not in a good way -- smell. Never what you want to smell when you walk into a sushi place. Our group ordered a large variety of maki/futomaki rolls. While they weren't horrible, I found them to be far from great. Something was off with either the seaweed or rice. Also, the yellowtail on the rainbow roll was clearly old and discolored. The only roll I liked was the 86 roll, and I ended up just eating the seafood part of it. The prices are lower than some of the competing sushi places downtown, but I left with the distinct impression that you get what you pay for, and that I won't be abandoning my go-to sushi place of Sapporo (on E. 6th) any time soon."}
{"text":"Sushi 86 is by far the best sushi place we have tried in Cleveland and is very reasonable. The staff is very friendly and welcoming! We always order takeout and it is always ready when we come to pick it up. The staff is very accommodating with extra or specific orders. We go there every week and the sushi is consistently delicious. Our favorities are the Philadelphia Roll and the Rainbow Roll. I have recommended it to anyone that asks about a good Sushi place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Carry out orders are fast, and the food is decidedly not 'fast food'."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews. When I lived in Cleveland, I would continually order sushi from here. This restaurant is clean and modern inside. The sushi is high-quality, tasty, and SIMPLE. I am all about simple, uncomplicated sushi. Some other downtown sushi restaurants disguise their poor-quality fish through deep frying and pouring large amounts of Sriracha or spicy mayo on everything. Not here. Plus they have DELIVERY! :) I recommend the rainbow roll, 86 roll, spicy scallop roll, and really anything with salmon."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is my favorite sushi restaurant in Cleveland. It is not the fanciest nor does it have the \"extravagant\" rolls that some places try but they do it right. The fish is very fresh and the rolls are quite large. The owner is an American lady who is one of the nicest people I've ever met. It is more of a lunch place than anything as they aren't open late or on the weekends. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who would ask."}
{"text":"Was very surprised after eating dinner here. I am moving to Cleveland and finding a solid Sushi place was a good surprise.  I had a Dynamite and 86 roll. The rolls were the complete opposite of one another and ended up the perfect complement. Very well made rolls as well, the ingredients tasted fresh and the pairings in the roll were smart. The miso soup was wonderful as well. The restaurant was clean and fresh feeling, service was sharp and polite.  I look forward to going back to try more  futomaki, nigiri and sashimi."}
{"text":"Best sushi, at a great price...love their spicy tuna and dynamite rolls. Good sushi"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit! Love going to a sushi restaurant or ANY restaurant and it actually being vegan friendly (vegan items listed on menu). They were very nice and food came out quickly! Only comment is that it was a little awkward when you go to pay on the iPad and have to sign and tip and the waitress is hovering over you.."}
{"text":"This was my first real experience with sushi! It was awesome! Ben the owner and head sushi chef really set us up. Make sure to ask for his non listed rolls. He has some killer specialty rolls that were requested by people who have stopped in, some famous. Don't leave Cleveland without stopping by and don't forget your favorite adult beverage!"}
{"text":"I've been here before when I was in town. It was good then, it is just as good today. Although BYOB, it suits my needs. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Sushi 86 has the best Sushi in Cleveland!!!! I have been getting there Sushi for 10 years now. I will go no were else for our company's Sushi needs. They can handle any event we do small or large. Keep up the fabulous work!!!!! Jim at Chefs Catering"}
{"text":"What a find!  First time in Cleveland.  I hail from the west coast.  This sushi impressed.  The staff was fantastic, very friendly.  The atmosphere was clean, bright, and not pretentious.  Kinda weird to see white guys rolling my fish, but they did good haha!  First time I have ever been stuffed on good quality sushi at a decent price.  Had to \"roll\" myself out the door.  :)  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi 86 has the most vegetarian/ vegan sushi options in Cleveland including, green bean, sweet potato, natto, spinach/ carrot, and red pepper/asparagus maki.  Their veggie maki box which contains 9 pieces and one inari is only $5.95.  They will even use brown rice for no additional charge, if you like that sort of thing.  Everything is always very fresh and well-made.  My non-vegetarian friends seem to like it as well.  The atmosphere is very clean and aesthetically pleasing.  They also offer fantastic catering and delivery on larger orders."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot... As a true Japanese girl, my body craves sushi on a regular basis, especially when I'm having a rough day, sushi always \"picks-me-up\" :)  You have to try their \"86 rolls\" if you enjoy big futo-maki zushi. The chef, Mike, is very friendly. Their ingredients are always fresh.. I think this place is MUCH better than Sushi Rock....  Their seaweed salad is yummy too! (if you eat-in, they will mix the seaweed salad with shredded daikon, and lemon...yum...)"}
{"text":"I would actually rate this place 4.5 stars if I could. The ambiance is very simple. That being said, They are working with what they have in this small space, and it is all about the food. The menu is creative, offering a twist on some familiar sushi as well as things I've never seen before. While not the best I've ever had, this is the best Sushi in the Cleveland area to date. My favorites were the spicy scallop and E.L.S. roll."}
{"text":"No idea on how this place has such high ratings? Picked this place because of the nice reviews...has got to be THE WOSRT sushi I have ever had. You could tell the rolls were previously made and sat in a refrigerator vs being made fresh. I would compare the quality to the sushi you get out of the cooler at your local Kroger. Very bland, and nothing to rave about. For those who have been going to this place for years...I feel like you are missing out!   Much better places to go for sushi in Cleveland: East Pacific, Shuhei, or Ginko."}
{"text":"Since relocating to the west side last year, I've been in search of a great sushi place to give me my fix that won't cost me an arm and a leg.  Something good, something close, something affordable, and something I'll want to keep going back to.  Well Sushi 86 is all of that that.  This tiny little place located in the Gateway district is the perfect place to grab a quick bite with the bf when neither of us feels like getting chef-y in the kitchen.    The restaurant is small, but that's never seemed to be a problem with a wait for a table or noise.  The service has always been great and I've honestly never had a complaint about the food.  The seaweed salad is a personal fave, the miso soup always hits the spot, and the sushi is consistently good (not the best I've ever had but definitely far from the worst).  You get a lot - food and quality - for your money and will always leave stuffed without blowing all the cash in your wallet.    What's great about this place is that it's BYOB so if you're in the mood to split your favorite bottle of wine with your dinner companion, bring it along with you - and as far as I know they don't charge a corking/glass fee.    The one thing I will suggest to remember is CASH - you're going to have to pay for parking one way or another and you definitely don't want to be left leaving your driver's license with the parking attendant as collateral for promising to return with payment for the garage (I may know this from experience...).    Overall, a highly recommended Sushi place for west-siders, and east-siders, alike."}
{"text":"Good - not great - sushi.  I ate in, and despite only 2 other tables, service was slow."}
{"text":"The Sushi was so fresh here.  Prices were great as well.  Came in here for lunch and walked out for $33 with the most expense sushi rolls (Delicious by the way), dragon rolls, avocado rolls, white tuna and soup.  Amazing!  Highly Recommend this place."}
{"text":"Its an ok restaurant. Sushi could be better, but the prices are lower than most places. Its more a place for lunch than it is for dinner."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite lunch spot in Downtown Cleveland. I have followed this little family-owned restaurant all over town as it continues to move into larger spaces to occupy its growing clientele. It has a consistent lunch crowd, but they will tell you that their main focus is their catering business.  I swear by the veggie menu (ie. Seaweed Salad, Edamame, Veggie Maki Combo). My lunch buddies love the newly created E.L.S. (which was ironically named after them).   This place offers you a lot for your money. The sushi is always fresh and made-to-order. It is such a breath of fresh air amidst the nearby Tower City Food Court which offers every variation of fried chicken you could imagine.   Note: While carry-out is very popular, if you eat-in the Miso Soup is free!"}
{"text":"I work in the heart of downtown and tried Sushi 86 for the first time. The smoked salmon maki box is delish. I ordered pick up but wish I had dined in. The aesthetic is really nice. All white. Very sterile. But in a good way. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I eat here twice a week.  I like the sushi and customer service."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have had in Cleveland in along time. Tempura roll is my favorite. Miso soup was excellent as well. You also can't go wrong with the sushi combo. Expertly rolled/hand crafted before my eyes. One has to sit at the counter for that and it was a treat to watch the techniques. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING sushi, fantastic service! The waiter was so helpful with recommendations and the atmosphere was great. Favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Sushi came quickly and the flavors were outstanding!  This family-owned business is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great sushi at a great price. Family run business. Super nice folks."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've ever had, including restaurants on the west coast. The chef is a true artist. We've been eating here for over 20 years and never been disappointed. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Any event that I attend downtown I make a point to start out the night with a trip to Sushi 86. Amazing sushi. Well priced with a good selection. Super friendly staff that dont make you feel like your just another customer. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here after reading reviews for takeout and I wasn't completely impressed. Parking was horrible just to get inside and once I entered the decor was very plain. The menu was very limited and the sushi was ok. I ordered the smoked salmon maki combo and the dynamite."}
{"text":"Just had the best sushi. Ever. I wish there was a location in Grand Rapids, MI. So good!"}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland, decided to check out the local sushi! Best, freshest sushi I ever had! Great spicy rolls!! Staff is very accommodating to substitutions - brown rice v white rice etc!"}
{"text":"I don't quite understand the rave reviews.  I could see that the place was clean, the food was fresh, and the service was friendly and on-point. I can appreciate the fast casual concept and free miso soup.   But, fair warning: this is a place for someone who doesn't really like sushi.  Their menu is limited, the sushi rice is bland and dry, and the preparation is just strange. There is a reason it takes a chef decades to perfect the art. Plus, 75 extra cents for spicy mayo? Sweet Jesus, I'm sitting on a plastic chair, throw it to me in a squeeze bottle.   I don't mean to be a snob. By all means,  if you want a quick lunch, or a casual dinner tailored to your liking, try it out. If you want bangin' sushi, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a good deal for great sushi. Considering the bad sushi experiences on other places downtown... it makes this one my one and only alternative. Price is right, excellent service and delicious sushi."}
{"text":"Meh. This place didn't quite impress me. It wasn't the worst, but it just didn't quite do it. While the service was great and I got my food quickly, it just didn't taste up to par. I can't say the interior decor did very much for it either. The bright whiteness of it made me a little uncomfortable; this could be a \"judge a book by its cover\" situation, but I kind of expected and would have believed in this place a little more if I had found some authentic looking decorations. I do support the whole \"industrial\" and \"modern\" look, but it felt more like a frozen yogurt joint than a sushi restaurant.  This just isn't my favorite--I don't get sushi often and I kind of want it to be \"just right\" when I actually go for it. Sushi 86 just didn't give me the experience and food that I expected for the occasion."}
{"text":"Pretty pleased with the broad assortment of menu options for my very needy dinner party. Great service and very fresh ingredients. We will be back...especially for the value!"}
{"text":"Simple but quite tasty! Honestly expected a bit less as looks more like a corner sandwich shop than sushi place...pleasantly surprised! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yum! Service consistent. Everything was so fresh and cleanly plated. Very happy with my meal."}
{"text":"Gotta say, I've got no complaints with this place. Best, FRESH, sushi I've ever had.   Our server, Vinny was lights out good. On top of service and recommended some good warm sale for us. He listened to what we wanted and delivered the perfect bottle. You could easily walk right by this small, boutique looking restaurant but you would sadly miss one of the best sushi places I've ever had."}
{"text":"Found Sushi 86 on one random night and it rocked. After a month,  I already loved Sushi 86 because of the friendly owner and the great wait staff but today was the best. I ordered Sushi 86 from grub hub and they noticed I'd ordered everything without wheat except one item and they called me because they wanted to check to make sure that  I knew. They allowed me to switch the item and still delivered in a timely manner with wheat free soy sauce! Love their customer service, love their sushi. They have a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Sushi 86 is definitely a gem of a restaurant in downtown Cleveland. Some of the tastiest suhsi I've ever had, let alone in Ohio - ask for the kraken roll if you get the chance. It's not on the menu but comes with a delicious layer of squid salad on the roll which is to die for.  And to top off the good food, the place is a BYOB - so you get to save on the drinks!   Only thing keeping it from a 5 stars IMO are the restaurant hours - not open on weekends! :(  Try the bi-weekly sushi class ($50 for pretty much all you can eat sushi) for a great time and fantastic sushi!"}
{"text":"What a fun, modern sushi bar! The happy hour specials were an unexpected surprise and the sashimi was super fresh! Yum!"}
{"text":"I did not eat here.  I went in, sat down and was greeted by their chef.  A dirty looking kid who was drinking a can of Coke at the counter, playing with his phone, and constantly wiping his hands on his dirty apron.  I got up and left."}
{"text":"For a group lunch, this place was awesome.  With the party of 10 that we had, we took over their dining area - but they were happy to move tables, chairs and efficiently serve the group.  Always a bonus in the downtown area.   With ample options of the non-fish variety, every member of the group was able to find at least two items that they were excited to try.  With miso soup served with every order of sushi, it's a fantastic deal.  I would also suggest the seaweed salad - pretty darn good.   What's not to like about this new, modern location?  The food is excellent. The service was friendly, efficient and paid our group the perfect amount of attention.  We were in and our within an hour.  The bills were neatly split up without us even having to ask (triple bonus).   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating sushi and love to experience new Japanese Restaurants. I just ate here yesterday and I loved it! I had a tempura roll, spicy salmon hand-roll, and two nigiri seared albacore. The restaurant owners are really nice and rolls here are big and taste great! If I'm ever in Cleveland again I'll definitely dine there again. Make sure to follow the yelp address not the google maps address since they just moved and google hasn't updated yet."}
{"text":"Simply amazing sushi. Love the fact your not inundated with choice here; what they have is done well, and without a lot of frills. You get a great tasty meal at a great price, and to me that's where it's at."}
{"text":"A modern sushi addition to Prospect Street that has a quality product that tastes as fresh as it looks. Hopefully it sticks around to continue the trend of improving the look and feel of downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stopped by to eat prior to attending a game. Good selection of beer. I had some salmon and yellowtail, pieces were small but fresh. Asked what there most popular roll was, she said the 3 way Reverse  Cowgirl,  it has tempura shrimp in it. I typically only eat raw but I would have to say it was delicious.  Was glad I tried it. Service was good and quick. Only gave it 4 stars due to no dumplings on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place! Wish they were open on the weekends! (Then I will personally keep them in business!). Love that you can get brown rice!,"}
{"text":"Sushi is decent, I would go back, although, I always feel like its not real sushi when its not a Japanese guy making it. lol.. I hope that isn't racist, but anyway its decent, and its nothing special."}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful. Staff was very nice and from the area. I def recommend this place. They should try to decorate the restaurant inside. Don't be deterred by the lack of decor."}
{"text":"This place overall is pretty good I would go here again and I hear they also deliver so that is in my future.  Miso soup: awesome.  House salad/ginger dressing: the salad itself was very good, quality vegetables and a good portion. The dressing was terrible however, very salty and looks like straight soy sauce.  Sushi: not the best but still pretty good, a step or two above giant eagle sushi."}
{"text":"We get sushi to go here every Friday night.  They get it right every time, now my husband walks in & they automatically know & confirm, \"No cucumber!\"   And the pink sauce is good, not like many of the other more expensive places.  I do my research, this place gives you the absolute best bang for your buck between downtown Cleveland & Avon.  No one menu item stands out, but it is all good.  Granted, I've had better in Hawaii & some other costal cities, but not in The Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi! Patio is dog friendly which is great! The dynamite roll is a great spicy roll! Great service  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Best sushi in downtown Cleveland!   I have eaten at Sushi 86 over a dozen times and continue to be amazed every time. I often see sushi 86 rolls floating around in my dreams, I am not sure the meaning behind those wonderful and mysterious dreams but wow do I wake up hungry!   The \"3 way reverse cowgirl\" roll is a true masterpiece and in my opinion the best roll I've ever had, anywhere. Dynamite roll, 86 roll, and ELS roll are all top notch as well. Underrated: get a couple extra sides of spicy mayo- so good. I'd eat a flip flop if u put that stuff on it."}
{"text":"The stark white minimalist decor is misleading... as you walk in the restaurant it feels empty, sterile, and \"cheap\".  Don't let this dissuade you... wait for the restaurant to fill with people, voices, and beautiful sushi.  As this restaurant is BYOB, we brought a bottle of red, and the waitress quickly supplied a corkscrew and glasses.  She made great recommendations including a special roll of the day.  Her service was warm, efficient, and friendly.    We started with the squid app (3.95) - a bowl of seasoned calamari that was not quite to our taste.  Onto the main event... the special roll of the day 3 way reverse cowgirl (15.95) was incredible.  It was balanced, filling, interesting, and really delicious.  We also really loved the ebi ten (5.50).  The sweet potato roll (4.10), rainbow roll (12.50), and 86 roll (10.25) were all fairly standard - but good none the less.  The boy also enjoyed eel nigiri (2.25).  The fish was fresh and beautiful.  The colors were bright, the taste was clean, and the slices of the fish (especially the eel) were thick full slices (we thought it was a great value).  On a whim, we shared mochi for dessert... both the chocolate and green tea were delightful.  The dough was thinner than mochi I've had before - which made it less gummy and really allowed the flavors of the ice cream to come through.  At 2.25 per mochi we thought they were well worth it - truly a great treat."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, super clean , well lit, sorta reminded me of an Internet cafe. My waiter was friendly and knowledgable. The sushi, well presented and tasty could  have been prepared in more generous proportions. Granted my waiter explained and offer more generously sized n alternatively priced options but   then again I'm probably spoiled by the sushi restaurants back home . The miso soup, in my opinion, was  flavorful but too dense n brothy-I seemed to taste too much of a chicken broth in its base. Overall a neat place to get your sushi on when ur in from out of town and have a hankering!"}
{"text":"Sushi 86 is a relatively new addition to recently re branded the 5th street arcades and is the best option for reasonably priced sushi downtown.  I usually order take-out several times a month and have been impressed with Sushi 86's consistency and quality. They have a pretty typical menu that includes the usual regular and specialty rolls, nigiri and sashimi.  Portions are very reasonable, prices are fair and the fish is consistently fresh.  I've never encountered the telltale smell of fish upon entering the restaurant (always a good sign).    The interior of the restaurant is pretty unassuming, with several small tables and a small bar area where the sushi is prepared.  The staff does a good job of keeping the restaurant clean.  I'd recommend trying the spicy scallop roll, the chirashi and/or the squid app.  You can also have any roll made with brown rice for no additional charge, which is a nice option that many sushi restaurants either do not offer or charge extra for.  This is a good option for a downtown sushi fan that is looking for a casual but quality, no-frills sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"This place was decent. The spicy sauce is a little bland and I wish they offered miso soup and a salad or rice with their rolls as a lunch special but they don't. The sushi is kind of pricey but decent. Worth the money probably not."}
{"text":"For Cleveland, the sushi is not that bad. I hope it stays open b/c the downtown area needs more places to dine and a good sushi place! Prices are beyond reasonable."}
{"text":"I love that there is a sushi place in the heart of downtown.  It's not the best sushi I have ever had in my life, and it is not super-traditional, BUT for the lunch and local yuppy dinner crowd, it's perfect.  The convenience factor alone is enough to keep me coming back, whenever I am in the mood for sushi . .  which is often.  The prices are reasonable, and they are very flexible in letting you mix and match rolls to make maki box combinations that are not on the menu.  One downside is the size of the restaurant - it is always super-packed during lunchtime, but I know they do some great business with take-outs.  The best part, for those who live in the Gateway/ E.4th area, is that they are open until 9pm on weeknights!  The service has always been very attentive and prompt.  Absolutely a neighborhood fav."}
{"text":"Stopping by on a trip through Cleveland. Read reviews saying to try the 3 way reverse cowgirl, and it was great (although I opted out of the hot sauce - not a fan personally). Service was friendly and quick, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Happy we happened by Sushi 86. Being from out of town, we searched and searched for a good sushi experience. The amicable staff and clean crisp dining area added more value to their already reasonably priced  offerings of creative cuisine."}
{"text":"Cannot beat Sushi 86 for the price point.   I have had better fish at Ginko, but my go-to is Sushi 86. Very good (but admittedly, not great) sushi, complementary miso soup, and some fun, American-style rolls. Always consistently fresh and well rolled sushi.   The kicker is, the head sushi chef is legally blind. Take a look at what he cranks out, and you'll be amazed."}
{"text":"The staff are cool but the food seemed over priced. Example; $1.00 for one piece of salmon about one penny size!"}
{"text":"Great for a light Saturday lunch.  We sat outside and enjoyed sake.  I got two skinny rolls (spicy tuna and salmon and avocado wrapped in cucumber instead of rice) and sashimi (escolar and salmon). Everything was so fresh and the server was super accommodating."}
{"text":"Great sushi, and fun place to people watch from while drinking sake outside in the summer!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We were visiting from out of town for a concert at Quicken Loans, and stopped in for a pre-show dinner. Hands down the best sushi I've ever had! We did the 3-way reverse cowgirl and it definitely lived up to the hype. I had the crab salad and lobster salad rolls too!"}
{"text":"Was in town on business and a co worker who is from Cleveland suggested sushi.  Having a 7 month pregnant wife who cannot partake (meaning I haven't had sushi since Nov 2014, I jumped at the opportunity (breaking my promise to my bride with child) and said OK.   Comworker suggested the reverse cowgirl something or other and It did not dissapoint.   It was a normal tempura roll but the kicker was the scoop of crab salad on top.  This was a legit roll from a true sushi lover.  I'll 100% suggest, recommend and back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Their fish is very CLEAN & FRESH!  I tried their... YellowtailJalepeno SpicyScallop (per Yelp tip, which yes-very good) Saba (hands-down the best Mackerel I've had the pleasure to encounter. FLAVORFUL & DENSE) 2x SeaweedSquidApp (starter and finisher, yum)  I was not so impressed with their rice, but (and I'm sure many \"sushists\" will squawk at this) to me the Fish is all that matters! It wasn't terrible but was a bit plain for my style."}
{"text":"First of all, to be completely honest, I have not eaten in house. This is therefore not a review of the atmosphere or the waiters. I had take out from Sushi 86 three times though, and I don't even know why I kept trying, because it was just boring. If you want good Sushi in Cleveland, go to Shuhei or Ginko."}
{"text":"My first visit. I was very happy we tried it. Definitely a quality sushi bar. Everything was very fresh and hand made. Even the green tea was top notch.   The service was great. All said, I would expect this to be more expensive than it is. Highly recommended! You will not be disappointed no matter what your expectations."}
{"text":"Sushi 86 is the most gluten-friendly sushi restaurant I've ever been to. Period. My boyfriend was diagnosed with a gluten sensitivity and his siblings, mom, and aunt all have varying degrees of sensitivity. Going to restaurants can be a challenge because we're always a 6-8 top and half the party is usually the \"burger, hold the bun\" or \"salad with no croutons\". So it was with great delight that we found a sushi restaurant with a GF menu. His parents were not so keen on sushi but our server was fantastic and made recommendations. We ended up ordering cooked rolls for them, and a tempura-type roll for dad, who is not GF. Our server also mentioned that the GF sushi rice is made separately (rice is GF but the rice vinegar is typically not) and we received temari, too. They also have low-carb type rolls, where the \"rice\" is substituted with cucumber. We made our ordering process easy for our server and he in turn took great care of us. We tried various types of mochi for dessert (a first for the parents). We liked the Thai basil and I think there was a passion fruit that was enjoyable.  BONUS: they have a Japanese whisky tasting flight! The prices were reasonable, too.  We have a local sushi place back home in VA that we go to that has GF options but it's really not as dedicated as this place. I don't know if we'll ever make the trek back to Columbus but I'm glad we gave this place a try."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good and generous sashimi.  Nice selection of sake. Decor is rather institutional.  The chef and waitstaff are fine.  It just needs a good decorator."}
{"text":"I'm probably the only Asian in the world who isn't a huge fan of sushi, but I have to admit, Sushi 86's sushi may just be life-changing.   Rather than being your typical sushi restaurant with dim lights and bamboo decorations everywhere, Sushi 86 is very clean and pristine. I love the simplicity of this restaurant's decor :)  For starters, I got the seaweed salad. If you've never tried this, I definitely recommend trying it here! I love the crunchiness of the seaweed topped with savory sesame seeds and a light yet refreshing dressing.   For my main dish, I ordered the Dynamite roll, which had spicy tuna, salmon and avocados. I couldn't really taste the salmon because it was overpowered by the spicy tuna, which didn't bother me too much. I also got a bite of my friend's Tempura roll, which was much tastier than the Dynamite roll in my opinion. Definitely getting that one next time!   For dessert, I ordered the mango and strawberry mochi ice cream. I absolutely loved this. The ice creams were very bite-size (probably smaller than an oreo cookie diameter wise?), so don't expect anything big!   Overall, a very pleasant experience dining here :)"}
{"text":"The thing about going out for sushi at lunch is that is always seems to take a while and I think it's because so many people are calling and ordering at the same time. Because I saw a lot of people walking in to get sushi and this has been my same experience with getting sushi for lunch at other sushi places.  The sushi was really good and they have complimentary miso soup. They kept our water plenty filled and the place was really inviting and very bright.  We got the spicy scallop, yellowtail and jalapeno and the salmon and avocado. The salmon and avocado was both of our favorite.  It's easy to drive right past it and not seen the sign. We had to loop back around and still missed it the second time so had to get out and walk around."}
{"text":"Very modern and simple design to match with the city vibe downtown. I commute via healthline/walking and so I do not worry about parking (sorry no parking tips from me). If you're entering from outside it may be a bit confusing since they have so many doors, haha. Once you make it in though, it'll be worth it. The quality of their sushi is pretty decent for its price point. If you're looking for quantity and a meal to fill you up, this is not the place for you. They also have promotional offers on certain days and times! I'm happy I got to try this place out, but I don't think it is for me."}
{"text":"I'm not one of those people who craves sushi everyday and/or can eat it all the time.  But, every now and then I have a SERIOUS sushi craving.  An I'm-willing-to-spend-$100-by-myself-and-stuff-my-face-all-night craving.  Luckily, Sushi 86 is nearby, open late and inexpensive.  I loved eating here.  The atmosphere is great--clean and fresh decor but relaxed and laid back.  The staff is excellent.  Really helpful and friendly.  And the sushi is really tasty.   I had the Dynamite, E.L.S., 86 roll and the Tempura roll.  E.L.S. Dynamite and Tempura were my favs.  The server talked us into getting dessert and I'm really glad we did.  The mochi is really good and a perfect end to any meal.  Had the vanilla but will definitely be trying the other flavors.  Also, as a bonus, this place is BYOB!"}
{"text":"The sushi was okay. I have noticed that there is not a huge variety of sushi around downtown Cleveland. The menu is small which is good so it does not leave you overwelmed with options; however, the prices are a little bit much then you would normally pay. I think they could work on their service and moving some of the clutter off the bar that people eat on and it would have a little bit of a better review."}
{"text":"There is a really great variety and unique rolls. I tried the sweet potato, 3way reverse cowgirl roll and the Danny's BLT. I didn't love the BLT but the rest were great- good price not your traditional sushi bar"}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi and not authentic as their were no Japanese staff in the restaurant. Very limited menu lacking appetizers and a number of nigiri choices. (No tuna toro). We also had less than stellar service. Long wait time to place order and get drink/wine refills on a slow Tuesdsy night. Out of the 6 rolls my group tried, I would recommend the E.L.S. roll."}
{"text":"I was here in Cleveland for business, so my coworkers and I decided to check this place out after reading some of the reviews on here. We were expecting this place to be a little more of a full service sushi place, but instead felt more like a semi fast food joint. The place is very plain and simple, and the menu is very limited. Most of the options are all sushi, and they don't carry ice nor alcohol.  All of us ordered rolls and they were great, but not spectacular. I would not come here on a date nor for a business dinner, but would consider coming back if dining solo or looking for a quick bite with friends.  The service was attentive, but we did feel the wait time for our food was a bit stretched out given how few people were there on this given night. Overall, not bad, but would probably not return."}
{"text":"I love how close Sushi 86 is close to my work.  Now that have extended their hours, makes this place even greater.  The staff is always so nice and friendly, even when they are extremely busy.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Little place but great sushi.  Try the cheifs choice, you wont be disappointed.  Very good service"}
{"text":"Amazing seems too bland a word to describe the sushi at Sushi 86. The creative sushi masters there have created some amazing rolls with flavors that alternate between exploding in your mouth and subtly blending together to wow your tastebuds. My sister and I had lunch there and had the chance to sit at the bar and watch the owner/head chef throw together some tasty combos with practiced ease. Super friendly guy, along with the entire staff.   We started with the seaweed salad and it was crisp and flavorful. For sushi, we had some classics (california) and then some of their clever creations. My personal favorite was the Three Way Reverse Cowgirl, but the Jala-Be-Thy Roll was amazing too. I saw a few other ones on the menu that I can't wait to try next time (which won't be too far off for sure). Also a great touch was the Japanese beer selection. I went with Ben's suggestion and was really happy with the suggestion of a Hitachino Nest Sakurasaku that went great with my rolls.   I don't hesitate in saying this was the best sushi I've ever encountered in the Cleveland area. Don't think about passing this pace up."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends and ordered some of their rolls. I ordered their miso soup to start and at first, it was warm but cold that I had to send it back to get it warm. Very salty in taste and seaweed was very hard in texture, usually this component should be paper thin. Tofu was just right. I glanced right over and it was already made in a pot so I wasn't too happy about that.   I ordered their 86 Roll and ELS Roll. Both tasted very good but not really a wow factor for me. One thing that I noticed about the 86 roll is that it came with siracha sauce drizzled on the plate. I thought this concept was a great idea because the sauce really worked with the tuna. Added more zing to the dish. As far as the ELS roll, the salmon on top drizzled with I believe mayo sauce was great as well. It wasn't slimy like other places I've been to, just perfect.   Atmosphere seemed too cold to be in because it was just so white everywhere. My friends and I think the walls should be painted in orange or red because that'll help bring more people in. Anyhow would I come again? Maybe if I was around the neighborhood.  On the plus side, they do offer a vegan menu and BYOB option!"}
{"text":"I had some very tasty vegetarian options: sweet potato roll, kampyo roll, avocado roll and miso soup. There were several other vegan and vegetarian options.   Food was 5 of 5. Dropped a star because the place was packed, one waitress for eat-in diners was overwhelmed, and the wait for take-out orders was a bit long.   In retrospect, the crowd and the wait was predictable. We went at dinner time on the night before a Cavs game. (The restaurant is right beside Residence Inn and across the street from Quicken Loans Arena.)   Anyway, I loved the food. I'll just call my take-out order in ahead of time in the future."}
{"text":"An unexpectedly hip sushi joint in Downtown. We had our doubts when we saw gaping indents in the white table we were seated at and we were the only diners in sight, but our waiter Vincent was everything the casual diner could ask for. Poised, attentive, and charming as though he had stepped out for a day from a butler training camp!  The specialty here seems to be in fusion sushi rather than the traditional flavor, so take that into consideration before you bring your friend (or inner) sushi snob. We were notified that they have rotating tea and drink specials - I didn't try them, but they sounded like they knew how to stay hydrated!  We had to wait quite a bit for our food even though we were the only customers on arrival, but it didn't seem like there were many food prep staff to take care of our five orders. Our complimentary Miso Soup was appreciated, but a little chalky and salty. Collectively we ordered a Gomoku roll, Tempura roll, Rainbow roll, E.L.S. roll, and 3 Way Reverse Cowgirl roll (how could we not?). Of these, the Reverse Cowgirl tastes the least like sushi (it's really not meant to) but was also the favorite. The Gomoku and Tempura rolls were close seconds, but all the rolls were fresh, and popping with color in contrast to the white on white on white decor. The rice was evenly cooked, seaweed not too crispy or soggy, and portion sizes were certainly generous. That didn't stop us from ordering three Mochi Ice Cream Balls though - in Red Bean, Green Tea, and Mango flavors. All fantastic, and highly recommended if you haven't tried mochi ice cream before! The mochi skin is a bit thin and it's pricey, but having a two-bite dessert won't make you feel too bad about humoring your sweet tooth right?   The sushi roll menu had enough strange names that we had to ask about their namesakes. E.L.S.? Erin Loves Sushi. Erin, as in a customer who just like you, has dined here. And 3 Way Reverse Cowgirl? Well... I leave that for you to find out, but suffice it to say that it also involves other patrons of Sushi 86. If that's not a sign of good customer relations, well, Vincent can convince you otherwise. He was there to fill our water glasses before we even realized the water to air ratio was skimming low, and even to replace the soggy napkins he placed as pseudo-coasters under the sweating cups. Every dish was presented with a flourish and cleaned up after as though it had never rested anywhere else than in your belly.   Vincent's classiness might prevent me from returning in sweatpants or post-imbibing, but this is definitely a place I can see myself coming back to with friends or even a chill date. I'm looking forward to taking advantage of their patio seating when the weather cools!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent-- no complaints, no high praises. I had super high hopes based off of the reviews but I didn't really find it any different than other sushi I have had in the past. The boxes they offer are a good deal. The menu isn't huge with a ton of options but there's enough. I had the E.L.S roll (I think?) and the philli roll. Like I said, good but nothing out of the ordinary.  Nice space, nice service. Just \"nice.\""}
{"text":"We called our order ahead and arrived 10 min, we then had to wait another 45 min for our order. The entire wait the man making the sushi was yelling and  berating his fellow co workers. It was embarrassing. We finally got our food and it was sub par at best. Tasted pretty much like grocery store sushi.. Will not be going back, I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi 86 is a great place to go for sushi. The staff is very helpful and friendly. They have no problem with special orders/requests and are very accomodating. The sushi tastes very fresh and the presentation is always on point. The prices are great!! The price point depends on what you order."}
{"text":"Waitress gave me price of 10.25 to make a dragon roll. Was charged $16.95 cause she 'just had it wrong'....ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Place isn't pretentious or overwhelming. Simple and solid. They seem to focus on the food and their guests, which is all you really need from any restaurant.   Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is good, not the best ever, but certainly delicious. It is a little over-priced, but you have to  consider the location. It's downtown Cleveland. The rolls are also on the smaller, simplistic side. Still very good though. They are a quick lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Very clean. Sushi is decent. One of my friends is obsessed so I have been a few times. It is average. Quiet place so if you want to talk this place would work. Seems like a good place to go if you are dumping someone. It's cheap enough and the polite atmosphere would deter a scene."}
{"text":"My GF and I stopped by before an Indians game a week ago. We seated ourselves and the server came over shortly for our drink orders. We started off with miso soup (which we later found that it was complimentary when dining in). The soup was a bit salty and it had thicker seaweed, but I found it enjoyable.   We ordered salmon and white tuna sashimi and for sushi we ordered their spider roll and dynamite roll. The food arrived fairly quickly and nicely presented with sriracha sauce accents on the plate. The salmon sashimi had a bit of fishy taste; maybe due to the thawing of the fish. However the white tuna was quite good. The spider roll was pretty basic, it was just rice, mayo, leafy lettuce. This is a bit different from what other sushi places offer; usually would find sliced cucumber and avocado. However the crab was crispy and served warm. The dynamic roll had spicy tuna, salmon and avocado. The spicy tuna had great flavor and the spiciness did not over power the taste of the tuna.   The interior of the restaurant is quite cold and sterile looking. The tables and walls are all white. However, there are colorful chairs to offset the bland look. The look is modern but it doesn't have any Japanese inspirations. I do like the large floor to ceiling windows that wrap around the store. There were only a few others dining in during our visit, but it seemed pretty busy for take out orders. This place does offer BYOB option, I will probably take that offer next time I visit."}
{"text":"We stopped in one evening before a Cavs game after a \"I don't know, you pick...no I don't want that...no, I want something different\" kind of discussion between the hubs and me. At first, I thought it'd be a no-go as the tables were full and we were kind of in a hurry. THEN, I spotted the spaces at the sushi bar. Perfect! I'm very over the bar food we tend to eat before a game.  Our server was wonderful, I was happy with my wine pick, and the owner (or manager?) was extremely personable and provided us something to do while we waited...since he was really interesting to talk to.  Between the two of us, we ordered the 3-Way reverse cowgirl (thanks to a Yelp review!) plus a jala-b-thy roll. I couldn't figure this out on my own apparently...but it follows in the spirit of \"hallowed be they name\", with \"jala\" for jalapeños. Get it?? Good. :) Food was quite yummy, and we definitely plan to visit again."}
{"text":"This place is more of a sushi fusion place than what you would consider a sushi bar. I did not see anyone Japanese making sushi here. I was very disappointed in the quality of the food. I came here after a show at the Q, around 7pm on a Saturday night. It's a small place with a handful of tables, so I was glad they were not busy when my date and I got there. Several people came in while we were there, but it definitely wasn't the hot spot and I can see (taste) why.  First of all, we were served a spicy tuna roll that was inedible. It was bad, as in spoiled. I took a bite and had to spit it out. It was part of the spicy sushi box so we just ate the other two rolls and left the tuna behind.  We also shared three other rolls. The sushi 86 roll, very unremarkable and not presented very well. The spicy scallop, it was decent. And the Philli roll which was pretty good, but, it was smoked salmon and not raw sushi. I came to the conclusion that this place is okay for cooked sushi but definitely not for raw sushi.  Another disappointment was the ginger house salad! We each ordered one, and it was just mixed greens with soy sauce on it! I was expecting the delicious creamy ginger dressing that is typical of most sushi places. I guess I should have read the menu more carefully as it did say \"soy ginger\" but still, soy on lettuce just didn't go together.  Our waiter was really nice. The service was very slow, but it wasn't his fault and he apologized when we were paying. Oh, another thing to note is that you pay up front by the door."}
{"text":"Okay Clevelanders - this week I ventured out. First the Sushi 86. Best sushi ever. I'm not saying Sushi Rock is not good but this unpretentious little restaurant is awesome. The sushi chef is classically trained and knows his stuff. Don't go for ambiance go for the sushi and great conversations with the owner."}
{"text":"Hubby and I wanted to try this place out because we love sushi. I ordered tempura roll AMAZING!! Hubby got rainbow roll and spicy tuna hand roll he wasn't too impressed it took a while to get service and to get our food. Good enough for done sushi but expect it to be quick unless no one is there I guess!!"}
{"text":"Good Sushi, reasonable prices, and excellent service. Especially liked the skinny salmon avocado rolls"}
{"text":"This is an interesting little place. The food is decent.  The atmosphere is totally different from a sushi bar, but it's ok. It kept me awake:) I had some nigiris and a roll. There isn't anything special, but they didn't exactly mess anything up either. The spicy sauce mix is pretty good. They earned a 3rd star on that one:-D If you are staying in the residence inn, it's right downstairs!"}
{"text":"Forget quick and dirty--let's talk about quick and clean!   Don't hate on the clean decor, folks. I'd rather have a clean, sterile-feeling environment than carpet. Carpet can be pretty bad in restaurants if not cared for... and let's face it, who really cleans that ish as much as they should? GROSS. I was pretty happy with the bright, clean atmosphere.   As many others mentioned, service is extremely friendly and the food comes quickly. I think we were sitting for a total of 35 minutes (and that's because we were talking) but really that's not a long time for a meal. And what the cheap? Granted, I didn't order a ton of food, but I would have thought the bill would have at least crept over $20. Nope.   Free miso soup? Or maybe they just forgot to charge me. Either way, it was delicious and greatly appreciated. And those lovely four stars come into play here: they customized my damn roll for me. I wanted spicy tuna with cucumber, no fish roe, with toasted sesame. They pretty much wrapped this thing inside out (they normally rock the seaweed on the outside) all to suit my palate. I also loved the spicy sauce on the plate. All around, pretty fresh, cheap, fast... what more could you ask for in a lunch-sushi place?   (A $14 tab, that's what.) I know..."}
{"text":"Sushi 86 is another downtown lunch jam.  I have never been inside, so I do not know what service is like in the zone. With that in mind I cannot give a full five stars just yet!  That being said, I blindly ordered a few rolls during lunch one day in search of something different from my usual grip, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I downloaded a menu PDF and printed it out for the others at work to use. I love avocados, and avocado rolls are $4.10. That is amazing. I get two, and there's enough left over. We can't stop ordering!!  THey deliver by bicycle, so be sure to call a bit early cause it takes a while (but never longer than quoted). There is also a $3.00 delivery fee, so be ready for that.  They haven't forgotten a soy sauce, chopstick, napkin, wasabi or anything! Definitely grip some lunch sushi from these guys if you work downtown!"}
{"text":"I'm always a little skeptical when I walk into a sushi restaurant and see non-Asian sushi chefs but this place served tasty fish!  It always looks kind of empty in the place, especially compared to barrio next door but we were very surprised at the great meal we got. Ordered the seaweed salad app and 2 rolls. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. Wouldn't say that this place wow-ed me in terms of ambiance or food, but both of our rolls tasted fresh and satisfied my sushi craving. Lots of creative rolls to try! Prices are very reasonable and there are options for everyone."}
{"text":"Not sure what the buzz all about! I ordered the Maki Box, avocado rolls and ice cream balls. Maki box tasted less than average, the avocado and ice cream were better. It's super cheap for what it offers, however, not worth 4 stars."}
{"text":"So looking for a spot to grab food in Cleveland and feeling the need for sushi so insteps Sushi 86 which was less than .5 miles away. We show up and almost miss it because it is not a big joint. Around 8 tables inside and it reminded me kinda of a froyo place from the coloring of the walls to the décor. The servers were very friendly and amiable and were very attentive to our requests. We asked if they had any adult beverages to which they sadly said no but they told us that the residence inn next door would sell bottles of vino and that we could bring in to consume the deliciousness.  They ask everyone if they want the Miso soup which is fine I suppose so I ordered one but unfortunately I was not a huge fan. It was overly salty and tasted like an \"instant\" miso soup pack so sad face. Sorry to have to disagree with the yelpers :-/ maybe my palette from having too much soup all over Asia especially in Japan?? We ordered the mixed Nigiri, Fresh fish nigiri, and the Dynamite roll. The nigiri was just okay in my opinion. Definitely not terrible but nothing really special by it and maybe that's a little food snobbery so apologies but I have had a ton of good sushi all over the country, Canada, all over Asia. The Dynamite roll was the better than the nigiri which to me is not a good sign. I am one of those folks that go to sushi to have the legit nigiri or sashimi over rolls that have a ton of sauce poured over it. In defense of this Dynamite roll however, it was well flavored without over saucing and a good portion of fish included so nice job making a solid roll.   All in all, a decent joint probably won't be back but I wouldn't say that it was somewhere I would never go again."}
{"text":"Big fan of the quick and easy lunches here.  If I have a ton of work, I will call ahead and run down to pick it up.  Always friendly and always fast.  The online menu is great when you have an office full of people who are new to sushi and dont want raw fish but cooked instead.  Everything is color coordinated.  Big fan of the Dynamite futomaki and the 86 futomaki."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch at this place today! I thought it was good sushi! My favorite is still the pacific east co. But there price and quality was spot on. My friend ordered the rainbow roll and seemed to really enjoy it! All in all great place for sushi lunch I ordered the salmon, eel, tuna and yellowtail sashimi! It was only $11.00!!  Also great customer service!"}
{"text":"Was craving sushi all day, and instead of going to our local buffet to pick some up ,me and a friend decided to try this place.  We sat down and The waitress asked if we would like to start with some miso soup which I'm not usually to big a fan of but I tried it because of the good reviews on here and it was delicious!  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, and the sushi was great. The prices were good too. Will Definitely make regular trips to this place when craving sushi."}
{"text":"This is a good sushi place. It's nothing crazy but it's good. I ordered the spicy Maki box and the Fresh Fish Nigiri. The sushi in the Maki box was just ok nothing great and the spicy came from the siracha squirted around the sushi. It was disappointing and it didnt make me want to order that again. The star of the restaurant is the Nigiri. The Nigiri is fresh, delicious and so flavorful. I ordered more Nigiri after my first box. If you like Nigiri try it here it's delicious. Service was great as well. They are nice, quick and refills are fast as well. Great location too."}
{"text":"I cannot say I loved it but I did not hate it either.  Like the decor I have to say it did not taste bad but it was absolutely bland!  I ordered the signature roll (tuna and yellowtail) and the Dynamite roll (spicy tuna and salmon) but I could not distinguish which was spicy or the salmon versus yellowtail.  It all tasted the same but I would say try it for yourself!  The price was good and the staff were pleasant!"}
{"text":"The fish is pretty good here. It's fresh, I think, or at least it tastes fresh, but that's good enough for me at this point.   I had the chirashi bowl, which at $16 is not cheap, but it was one of the better ones I've had. Small, but it had a nice variety. Chirashi bowls elsewhere only seem to include 3 or 4 different types of fish. This one had yellowtail, yellowfin, albacore, salmon, surf clam, octopus, escolar, shrimp, crab salad, and even some seaweed salad. All good stuff (except the dry, limp shrimp).  Judging from the rest of the menu, their specialty rolls don't seem that special, but you can't go wrong with the basic stuff when the fish is good quality.  As others have mentioned, the decor is simple, but the service is excellent and the food comes fast."}
{"text":"We were walking down E.4th and were looking for a place to eat, but nothing was really appealing to us..we then headed down on prospect street and saw this brightly lit sushi restaurant.  We walked in and seated ourselves. First impressions this place looked like a pho restaurant out of southern california.  No asian theme whatsoever, which I kind of liked lol.  Our server was super friendly and quickly got our drinks.  We ordered the seaweed salad and it was quite amazing I'm not gonna lie, but it came with a lime which I thought was a tasty addition. I ordered the rainbow roll and the BLT roll and my GF got the maki box.  Surprisingly my gf thought this place was quite good, which came as a surprise to me as she's a hardcore sushi enthusiast.  All in all, great place to eat for a quick stop in. I totally recommend the BLT roll amazingggg. Quick service, friendly staff, and a clean, laidback environment. What more can u ask for?"}
{"text":"I tried the sweet potato roll.  The place was clean, knowledgeable and accommodating staff.  Great location in the Arcade.  Ended up here after the wait at Barrio was over an hour on a Friday night with a big concert at the Q. I don't think I would drive downtown for sushi at this place but if in the area and craving sushi this is the definitely a place I would go."}
{"text":"Sushi 86!  We went there for dinner around 7 PM on a week night.  Not many customers and kind of sterile looking place.  I had my doubts...until the food started rolling out.  Loved it, loved it, loved it..  Had I known it was BYOB I would have brought some Saki and it would have gotten a five start rating.  We are thinking about going back before we leave Friday so it just might get that 5th star.  Oh year I forgot to mention.  Prices are really good."}
{"text":"An excellent casual place.  Bright, airy design.  Outstanding value.  Very friendly owners."}
{"text":"I love Sushi 86. The BLT roll is phenomenal. I also enjoyed the dynamite roll and the salmon and avocado roll. Unfortunately, save for the latter of the previously mentioned, these items are not cheap. But it's in the 5th Street Arcades so, to some degree, that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum! This is always a great go-to place for some quick sushi. As others have mentioned, it's a very clean, stark look complimenting the clean, fresh sushi they serve. This past visit, I tried the crab salad roll and the Ebi Ten - shrimp tempura, avocado, and spicy mayo aka my new favorite. I also got the seaweed salad which tasted like all other seaweed salads I've ever had - delicious. I only had to wait 20 mins for my call ahead to-go order. The restaurant itself is small, so it would be good for a lunch or dinner for 2. I wouldn't recommend for a date, being that it is so bright and not very intimate. I also wished they would put descriptions on all of their rolls, not just their speciality rolls. But I would like to end this on a bright note - their service is so great and friendly! So go eat lunch here and shop in 5th st arcade afterwards!"}
{"text":"Sushi 86 is the go-to take out option for my coworkers. At first I thought this was because it was fresh, cheap, and convenient. Unfortunately, I forgot the Rule of Sushi, which states that a sushi place can only be two of the three above. Sushi 86 is cheap (good luck finding a pound of sashimi for $16) elsewhere and it's the only sushi spot in the Gateway district open at night. Unfortunately every time I've been there or ordered delivery, the octopus is super chewy, the salmon has a funky fish odor and taste, the tuna is mushy, etc. On the two occasions I've eaten in the restaurant, my order has taken over 45 minutes to even come out, in a restaurant that was half empty, and other people that ordered got their food before me. They also forgot the diet coke and I had to reorder! If you're in a real sushi bind come here, you won't get food poisoning, and it will give you a fix, but otherwise steer clear."}
{"text":"Sushi 86 is amazing. The service is always great and the food is even better. Try the BLT roll, it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"I order take-out or delivery here just about once every two weeks.  They are the best sushi downtown, and as I mentioned, they deliver!!  The location of the actual restaurant is a little hard to find, and kind of small (though I have only been in there to pick-up the take-out so my overall experience is pretty limited).   The sushi is delicious.  It always is fresh and tasty.  We get the spicy maki box, yellow tail and scallions, and the seaweed and oshinko every time we order.  We've tried a bunch of other rolls there as well and have never been disappointed, but those are our favorites for sure. I would highly recommend Sushi 86 as your go-to sushi place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'd love to come visit you guys more but I can never stop in, get my lunch and eat it before my hour break is up.  I only come in about once every six months and while I always find lots of changes in the better menu and drink menu the wait time doesn't work for me :("}
{"text":"Great sushi, nice owners, and very affordable. The owners offer a simple atmosphere and instead concentrate on putting out fresh delicious sushi. And they succeed. This has become my go-to sushi joint in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Solid sushi place, low key decor and feel. Byob is nice, but Probably not the nicest sushi date place. Good food though, nice prices, spicy salmon actually had a real kick.   I'll be back when I want some quick casual sushi and I'm dt anyways, since parking is a bit of a drag for a more casual spot."}
{"text":"I can't decide if I love this place so much because it's yummy sushi or because it's across the street from my office. At any rate, it's a great place for lunch. I love the crisp, white, \"purchased from Ikea\" decor. I am a sucker for Ikea.   They have fabulous, filling futomaki. I am particular fan of the 86 roll. Although you may not want to take a client/vendor there or an embarrassing situation may ensue in which you shove a giant piece of sushi in your mouth and look like a chipmunk storing for winter. Not that I am speaking from experience.  Carry out is also quick and fresh and they deliver to area offices. Bonus!"}
{"text":"Not much business in here and they move slower than a snails pace. Ordered a simple rainbow roll and it took more than 30 minutes to make.  While waiting they ignore you and when you ask about the rolls they say they are still working on it. Mediocre sushi and over priced."}
{"text":"The 3-Way Reverse Cowgirl is the best sushi roll in Cleveland. I know, I know. Get your mind out of the gutter. The 3-Way used to be on Sushi 86's \"secret\" menu, and it has since graduated to the regular menu. A lovely combo of tempura shrimp, avocado, crab salad, spicy mayo, hot sauce and sweet soy.   Sushi 86 is consistently excellent. The prices are reasonable, the service is fast, and the food is fantastic. Their menu is great, because it accommodates both sushi novices and experts, offering something for everyone. The noise level is moderate, which is perfect for lunch meetings or evening dines where you'd just like to have conversation. Just a short walk from most of downtown's key attractions, too. Best of all...the owners are local!"}
{"text":"Really love this tiny in the cut sushi place. The price were nice and affordable, the service was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy yet spacious."}
{"text":"College chic.  This is purely a sushi bar, if you have a member of your party that does not like sushi, there are no other options.  It is kid friendly as long as you have have a child like my son who can make a meal out of rice or have a daughter like mine who loves sushi.  Actually, this place was her idea.  If you love sushi, this place is really great.  Eight year old daughter had two California rolls, she devoured it.  First order for us was the box order of California roll, shrimp roll, and crab salad.  It was good but...wait for it...then came the Three Way Reverse Cowgirl Roll.  I am blushing a little by posting it but it will rock your sushi world.  It's really like 2 stacked sushi rolls.  Top is a crab conglomerate like I have never experienced, bottom has a crunchy fried element.  Fantastic.  Had the Riesling, loved it.  If you do not appreciate a wheat grass smoothie do not go for the tea.  Extremely friendly staff."}
{"text":"Outstanding hospitality, great ingredients, amazing food. One of the best sushi experiences I have ever had.  Strongly recommended, if you happen to be in this part of Cleveland.  Have come three times this week and every time for better."}
{"text":"Joel was great!!!! Will be returning because of his hospitality! Also enjoyed the sushi rolls. I recommend the Ebi Ten for those who enjoy tempura. Will be returning such a great little spot!"}
{"text":"This place rocked!!!  Living in NYC and Dallas, I can be a bit of a sushi snob and this hidden find in Cleveland has fresh, creative sushi in an immaculate but simple atmosphere. I sat at the sushi bar and chatted with the owner as he prepared my sushi. He made rolls for me that weren't on the menu. I mentioned that I like spicy and he delivered! I can't say enough good things about this place and next time I visit Cleveland I'll definitely be back....maybe I can convince him to open a restaurant in Dallas!"}
{"text":"Just got delivery and what a disappointment.   I usually love a green salad and ginger dressing at sushi places- the dressing was a lot like soy sauce with gingerish chunks at the bottom. I also ordered a tuna and a shrimp nigiri- for $2.75 per piece expected something moderate. The tuna smelled really \"fishy\" and was unpleasantly chewy, the shrimp was fine just small. The miso which was reviewed really highly in other posts tasted sour. WTF. Finally the Gomoku roll was a huge let down. The smoked salmon overpowered all of the other flavors. There was eel in only about half of the roll. I ended up picking the roll apart and eating the contents sans the salmon.   What a let down."}
{"text":"The sushi chef was so friendly! He chatted with me while I waited and while I ate. . I had pieces of eel and squid and was very pleased with the flavor and preparation of both. My afternoon snack was under $6!! Decor is minimal, but in a space this small it really worked. There are live plants and lots of light. It's in one of the Arcades...not super apparent from the street, but use your Yelp app and you'll find it. I definitely recommend this little spot."}
{"text":"Great prices, really friendly service, and tasty sushi. They serve quickly at lunch, and they have a nice variety. This small and simple spot doesn't have the best sushi in town, but it does offer the best bargain in town, and it's tasty. I'm always happy with a lunch here."}
{"text":"SUMMARY:  More like 4.5 stars.  They have tasty veggie rolls that are very well-packed for delivery.  FULL STORY:  Have only gotten delivery from here.  I like it -- one of the better takeout/delivery options I've had in CLE.   They manage orders through their own website (nice organization, easy to use, even has check boxes for soy sauce type, extra wasabi, etc) with a very reasonable delivery fee of $2.  It arrived exactly within their projected window, delivery person came right up without any confusion or calls.  We ordered a few different things, and all were tasty and arrived totally intact -- they were packed really thoughtfully!  I especially like that they offer a veggie roll with tons of veggies in it aside from the usual cucumber rolls (this one had red bell pepper, asparagus, cucumber, green bean, avocado, lettuce, spinach, and inari).  Light on the rice, which I think is good.  Speaking of rice... they offer brown rice with any of the rolls without an up-charge. Awesome.  Their inari was tasty and not too tough.  Really pleasant.  Sweet potato roll isn't heavy like they can sometimes be.  They can also make it \"inside out\" with sesame seeds on the outside.   Can't speak for the fish options (which, granted, is why most people want sushi), but as a veggie person, I thought these rolls tasted fresher and overall better than what we had at Ginko.   Looks like they have some good lunch options that I haven't tried... and I still want to try the kimchee + noodles (sold out when we ordered).    Minor gripes (that are mostly outweighed by positives) are that they don't offer water bottles or pepsi products (just coke / diet coke / sprite / tea online)... they close early for delivery (9pm), they still use styrofoam, and my order had one mistake in it... (small - not even worth correcting).     Note:  Their store is moving to a new location soon, but still within 5th St. Arcades!"}
{"text":"Sushi 86, in my opinion, serves some of the best quality fish that I've eaten in Cleveland.  Think of this place as an extremely casual sushi bar.  But don't make assumptions about the quality of what you're getting just because the restaurant is inside a mall.  What you get is pretty good.  Service is pretty good and both the people who bring out your orders and the people who roll the sushi are extremely friendly.  They don't have as many unique rolls as other restaurants, but the rice is done right and the rolls are a good size - not really large but also not skimpy at all.  I liked the 86 roll, which has yellowtail, tuna, vegetables, and tamago inside it.  You get a good variety of fish if you order the chirashi, which is just the fish on top of a bed of rice.  Another bonus is that they cater sushi platters."}
{"text":"Live downtown and have ordered delivery twice. Satisfied both times! Vegetarian rolls + miso soup. always super fresh. The second time we ordered was on a weekend and our food was at the door in less than a half hour!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Sushi 86 for a few years.  Pretty good Sushi, my 3rd favorite.  I have ordered sushi platters for several parties at my house which were a hit and the fact they deliver to the poker room at the casino is awesome.  With that being said their service has gone downhill over time.  If you ask for something different on the menu they act like it's a real inconvenience.  My second last order I requested no soy sauce and they not only did they not put dressing on my salad, the rice was hard, the rolls weren't tight like they were rushed and they put 4 containers of soy sauce in my order.  Was this some sort of sick message from a prosodium employee?    Today I ordered Sushi for delivery to my office and talked to a rude employee who argued with me on a service charge and told me it will be at my office in 45 minutes.  Hour and 20 minutes later I called and just asked for a refund.  No lunch for me today, thanks Sushi 86!  This may be the last time I order from them, there are better options in the downtown area and if I'm going to spend $35 on myself for lunch I would expect a little bit better attention to detail and nicer employees."}
{"text":"me and my mom came in to order take out. parking is not easy!! also we had to automatically add an 18% tip to our bill-which for take out I feel is a bit much. also I ordered \"assorted pickled vegetables\"  yet just got cucumbers."}
{"text":"What a great surprise while traveling!  Sushi was high quality, the people were very nice!  I just walked in and ordered to go because I too tired to eat in.  My food was ready really quickly and I witnessed them produce a large amount sushi in the short amount of time I was there finishing my glass of wine.  This is a must for locals or out of towners!"}
{"text":"Really impressed by this restaurant.  Had the Danny BLT which was quite delicious but challenging to eat.   Love that they have \"boxes\", which is essentially a lunch platter with beautifully themed rolls ( 3 different types).  Would definitely go again and recommend to anyone looking for sushi downtown."}
{"text":"I do quite a bit of travel and this spot was really good for sushi. The owner (Ben) and mom (Ms Rachel) were holding down the fort tonight. I asked Ben to make me whatever he wanted and he asked 3 simple questions, next thing I know I have three beautifully presented and flavorful rolls. The spot is a great location if your on your way to an event at either Quicken Loans Arena or Progressive Field, or as some other Yelpers stated if you work in the area. The prices were very reasonable, better than Sushi Rock. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you don't want to go to Ginko in Tremont for sushi, come here. This place is amazing and I absolutely fell in love with the sushi selection here. It is much better than the other sushi places in Cleveland, especially that of the \"hip\" Sushi Rock. I hope this place picks up business from the casino as I hate to see this place close.   I came here during the late afternoon, a couple of hours before an Indians game. The place is a minimalist design so don't expect a Japanese themed sushi bar here. I had the Spicy Maki Box ($7.25 for 9 pieces) along with Miso Soup ($2.50) and the Strawberry Mochi Ice Cream Ball ($2.25). The sushi was delicious, containing fresh fish along with perfectly cooked sushi rice. The miso soup was flavorful but i still prefer the miso soup at Ginko's. Very friendly and attentive staff and this made my trip into Cleveland a pleasant experience (also it made up for the fact that I lost some money gambling at the Horseshoe earlier in the day).  Recommended Dish: Spicy Maki Box"}
{"text":"This is my first time getting sushi downtown in Cleveland.  The experience was very good.  Sushi was fresh. They take their time to present the dishes to a fine dining standard, at a right price.  The portions are somewhat small without any special half price or ayce deals but this is an upper class place so it's not really a bad thing to not have.  The fish and beverage selection is not as diverse as other places either, but what you do get is fresh and well presented."}
{"text":"I honestly cannot say enough about this place. The food is amazing and it's just a cute, little place with a nice atmosphere and great service. We had the ELS, BLT and the Jala B Thy rolls. Bacon is always delicious but putting it in and on a roll is a mouthgasm. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Friday night downtown....Indians game, concert.  I think people overlook this place because it blends in to the woodwork. Very good sushi. Hubby, who is. Oy a big sushi eater, went for the salmon box, he loved it. Salmon done three ways. I had a spicy crab roll and the seaweed salad. Both very good and very reasonable prices. Good food, good prices, no wait on a busy night...give it a whirl, well worth it."}
{"text":"Can't beat the price or service. Sushi is good to boot. Some good specials not on the menu so be sure to ask."}
{"text":"It's definitely good value since this place is relatively cheaper than other places around the area but the food is good enough for 4 stars. Their miso soup was just right and nigiri was in between moderate - good."}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi. Friendly staff with good recommendations and very accommodating. Don't leave without having the Mochi!"}
{"text":"Shout out to Lauren for introducing me to THE best sushi I have ever had! (and encouraging me to order the 3-Way Reverse Cowgirl) This roll is just as dynamite as it's name would suggest! If I'm remembering correctly, it contained shrimp tempura with avocado with a GIANT lump of crab salad sitting on top all drizzled with spicy mayo, hot sauce, and sweet soy. Yum. So delicious. Can't say enough. Would order a thousand times.  That being said, my hands are incapable of working chopsticks correctly. I try and try again and I just end up with a sad pile of mangled sushi on my plate. After destroying one piece of the beautiful creation that is the 3-Way, I decided to call in back up and ask for a fork. Not only did they bring me a fork, but they were kind enough to think I still had it in me and brought over a pack of those chopstick cheaters! This was the best thing ever, and I was so glad I could still make an attempt with the chopsticks. Maybe there's hope! All in all, the sushi was delicious and filling and the staff was amazing."}
{"text":"Oh why oh why!  I had high hopes for Sushi 86. I went with two fellow yelpers to try Sushi 86 on a late night during the week.  We had high hopes, but, Sushi 86 was just okay. Nothing great, nothing amazing, but meh.  It's nice that the dishes come with miso- however, their miso soup was extremely salty that I felt my fingers bloat. Sigh. But very nice that they offered.  Next we ordered an array of sushi- the 86 roll, the rainbow roll, some nigiri, etcera.... and we just weren't impressed. The fish was okay tasting, but there was just some American style sauces that came with the sushi and they were all not very...impressionable. It was just the type of sushi I felt that I could get at a mediocre sushi buffet.  Plus, the service was kind of slow. Meh.  So, was I a fan? It was ok. If you're in dire sushi craving, then it's ok. I think there are much better places in Cleveland though, so I would definitely recommend somewhere else. But it's just ok, in my opinion....."}
{"text":"This place's sushi is pretty good! They are fresh and well made. Then why did I give it a three star? It's cuz of the price. They are over priced. Maybe it's cuz the restaurant is located in downtown Cleveland, their rent is probably higher. In order to survive, they have to mark the price higher. However, I would pay less for more food (same quality) in Cleveland heights - why would I bother going there again?  The waiters/chefs were very friendly and nice! Thumbs up to them! It is also a nice, cute little space - a good place to go on a date if you care about the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I almost missed this place when driving by because you can barely see the sign on the window. If I wasn't looking for this specific restaurant (based on other yelpers reviews), I probably would've never found it. It's in the Colonial marketplace. Sushi 86 seems to be a great lunch place. If I worked downtown, I'd probably be a regular here.   It's more of a casual sushi restaurant as opposed to a fancy restaurant.  ie. the cups and bowls are styrofoam and the spoons are plastic.   I like that they offer low sodium soy sauce! A lot of places don't so it was a nice bonus. And I liked the miso soup was hot (a lot of times you get just warm soup, but this was a nice, hot soup which was nice since it was cold and rainy out.) The miso soup was a little salty but it was ok in between bites of sushi.   The dynamite roll was really delicious! Probably my favorite of the ones we tried!  I also liked Danny's BLT. It was very interesting that even though it did have smoked salmon in it, you could only really taste the bacon!   The staff (a woman and the young sushi chef) was very friendly.  Note: They do deliver (for orders over $20) which is great for people who work in offices downtown!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi in the heart of Cleveland. Good prices as well. Really fresh fish in a clean restaurant, everything you're looking for in a sushi spot."}
{"text":"I just recently moved back to Cleveland and had heard good things about Sushi Rock, but when I got downtown, found that Sushi Rock was closed.  I went to yelp and got the nearest sushi restaurant - Sushi 86 came up.  When you walk in, it is small.  We sat down and the waiter brought a bottle of water to the table.  Each meal comes with soup and the food was amazing!  The jalapeno yellow tail roll was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome sushi place in downtown Cleveland! The interior is very clean and modern, with a good number of tables both inside and outside. Staff was very friendly and attentive and the sushi was delicious at a great price.  We tried the 86 roll (this one has raw fish in it), which had tuna, yellowtail, avocado, cucumbers, masago and tamago, and it was amazing! We also had the Gomoku roll, which included smoked salmon, eel, shrimp, crabstick, tamago, and sweet soy sauce with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. This roll was awesome too - particularly for those who aren't fond of raw fish - this one has only cooked ingredients. Both of these rolls came with lots of toppings, were well made and plated, with only a thin layer of nori and rice (no padding of rice in the rolls like at some other sushi places). Also, the prices for the rolls were all very reasonable (in fact, cheaper than some decent places in CA).  Only downside is that it is located in the heart of downtown Cleveland, very close to the Progressive Stadium, so parking is either an arm and a leg at one of the garages (though, these might be best deal if you're staying for several hours and willing to pay daily max), or if you snag one of the street metered spots (but these are usually 2 hour max)."}
{"text":"Good sushi-- check.  Mom and Pop (and son) place-- check. Cool place--- check.  Sushi 86 moved from Ontario to a really wonderful, bright, airy spot in one of the Arcades. The atmosphere is bright, modern and relaxing.   The sushi is still of great quality and beautifully presented.  Son (of Mom, Pop and...) is really fun and chatty, even while he finishes off beautiful plates prepared by Pop.  Sit at the counter-- it's fun!  Con-- yeah, it can get slow when the place is packed for lunch.  It's sushi, not fast food.  It takes time to do it well.  Solution-- grab a menu and order ahead."}
{"text":"Sushi 86 has some of the most delicious sushi downtown! The location is convenient, the price is right, it's BYOB, the owner/waitress is very friendly and the sushi chef is an absolute dreamboat!   I tend to go to Sapporo Sushi more often, because it is closer to my office, but I have never had anything less than a fabulous meal at Sushi 86!"}
{"text":"The decor is stark white and sterile as some other reviewer has noted. I do not care about atmosphere much and that does not bother me. The people working are very kind. The few rolls that I tried were good and for a good price. I have been in the mood for sushi a lot lately and this place seems like a good place to go that is close to home. I am not a sushi expert but did enjoy my meal here."}
{"text":"Great sushi joint downtown!  Sushi 86 not only has convenient hours, such as lunch weekdays/weekends and late nights but also offers quick take out and delivery. It's a relatively small space with modern ikea style tables and chairs and a small sushi bar.  I normally stop in during my lunch hour however this time I decided to pick up my usual order and take home.   My takeout order was finished quickly, I was ordered and out in less than 20 min.   Note - when you order take out for multiple people they will place each order in their own saran wrapped box (awesome), most places do not do this so its make it a little confusing to dish out to multiple people.   The sushi is always fresh and tasty. They offer some unique \"Americanized\" rolls - the most popular being the 3 way reverse cowgirl.  They also offer solid basic rolls such as salmon avocado, tuna cucumber and great chirashi. They also do a pretty good seaweed salad with shredded jicama? instead of the usual cucumbers.  FYI- they recent started doing happy hour with 25% off select rolls and drink specials Monday-Friday 4-6pm.   Next time your downtown and need a sushi fix, stop in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Located just to the right/east of the Prospect entrance to the 5th St Arcade, this white-washed sushi restaurant serves up delicious portions creative sushi creations. They classic, good standbys are on the menu, but they have some in-house creative combos listed as well. There is also a vegetarian and gluten free listing. When you are seated you are brought water and offered an order of miso soup. The service was friendly, but slow. There was a large party in the atrium of the arcade which I think slowed the restaurant down. Despite this I will return as the flavors were fresh and went well together. The sushi was made neatly and the plating presentation was crips and clean also. The hours of this place (9p even on Sundays) are the best hours of little downtown shops to date."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  The prices promise a decent level of sushi.  I ordered their veggie roll and lobster salad roll and it was mediocre.  The stuffing was good but the nori (seaweed) was tough and chewy, thus ruining the experience."}
{"text":"Such great sushi! The fish is fresh and they have some unique rolls. My boyfriend and I love meeting there for lunch or getting takeout on my way home from the office for dinner. Try the 3 way reverse cow girl...it will change your life."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place, the sushi was average at best but what dropped a star was the presentation.  No flair!  I like the attractiveness of the sushi place, not just dumped with nothing on the side, no garnish, no wasabi or ginger, really?  Service was attentive but could not make up for the low quality of the food both visually and taste.  Try other places and skip this...or set the bar low...."}
{"text":"Sushi 86 is my go to sushi spot downtown. I typically get sushi 86 at least once a week  what can I say...I love it!  I've never had anything I didn't like there..if you're feeling adventurous try the 3 way reverse cowgirl. Also love the classics: spicy tuna roll and California roll. I regularly get their miso soup...it's super flavorful and delicious. While their atmosphere could use a little help, their patio is super cute and relaxing. Also they do a great job when it comes to take out...they make it so easy if you're ordering for multiple people by separating each order."}
{"text":"Solid! I popped into Sushi 86 yesterday evening for an ultra-quick nosh before another event in the Arcade. I was glad for the chance to finally give it a try and was not disappointed! I plopped down on a bar stool and ordered two standard maki (eel cucumber and salmon avocado, my go-to's!). The new space is sparkling clean and decorated serenely. I enjoyed pleasant conversation with the chef/restaurateur while he rolled my order, which appeared in mere minutes. The rolls were excellent - all of the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I savored each piece as well as I could given that I was short on time! I'll look forward to returning to linger a bit longer and try a broader selection of menu items!"}
{"text":"I order take out for lunch from here and it is exactly what I'm looking for every time.  When you eat in they serve glass in Styrofoam cups, if you can get past that you'll love it."}
{"text":"I do like It here. This is another place I do not frequent, as its far from home. My last visit was before a sporting event. So I was more that thrilled that they even took our reservation. This place is located next to Barrio downtown. They do not have an extensive sushi menu, but they do have the most  common types of sushi. I do wish there was a bigger offering.   During my last visit I ordered some typical items. California roll, seaweed salad, and some type of lobster rolls. Everything was super fresh and the service was speedy. I didn't feel rushed. Overall this place is a solid 4 stars.   I would dine there again and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Downtown for a Tuesday evening.  My 10 year old daughter wanted to try sushi and out waiter was kind and happy to help us order. Food was tasty. Decor was simple and modern - my daughter liked it because \"if it had more it would have been kind of junky looking.\""}
{"text":"I discovered this place yesterday and LOVED the smoked salmon maki box. I couldn't stop thinking about it so I went back again TODAY and had the spicy maki box. What will I have tomorrow?!  Sushi 86 is on the opposite end of downtown from my office but the walk is worth it!  Update: I've now been to Sushi 86 THREE DAYS IN A ROW...this time picking up an order for my co-workers too.  One co-worker screamed that the BLT roll was \"ORGASMIC\".  Well done, team...your friendly personalities and commitment to the city's BEST SUSHI are commended."}
{"text":"After being on a bit of a sushi hiatus, my son and I traveled downtown to check it out. First, the staff (our server), was extremely helpful.  I know what I like, but my son who is 12, had lots of questions.  The kind like...\"what's this (pointing) and how do you say this\" kind of questions. She was great.  Patient, which is good for sushi novices.  Best edamame I have had in a long time. Big, crisp, and perfectly steamed.  We had two of the Maki Boxes (Fresh Fish and California)  Total of 18 pieces, and a good combination in each box.  And their wasabi...watch out!  It is legit!  Devilishly strong.  But, that is a good thing.  As for the decor, it is a stark white, with simple tables.  It's sushi.  I would rather have my eyes focused on my food, than the walls.  Very clean and comfortable.  And can't stress enough, the great service.    I will be back again and again.  The hiatus is over!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest...when I walk into a sushi place and it's completely empty and the sushi chefs are young, non-Asian dudes, my normal instinct is to run screaming in the other direction.   But we decided that we had walked enough and would give this little, new-looking sushi spot a chance. It was very clean and we needed to sit down and have an adult beverage.   Win #1: They had Japanese whiskey Win #2: They had a really nice selection of sake Win #3: They had sampling menus of the sake and whiskey (flights, basically) Win #4: The staff there were friendly and as we drank our flights, we got friendlier Win #5: The sushi was actually really good.  I had very low expectations for the sushi, but the fish was fresh and everything we tried was excellent.   I still don't fully trust non-Japanese sushi chefs. It's part of my DNA and I won't apologize for it. But, over the years, I've become friendly with some excellent sushi-makers that happen to be from Malaysia...so yes...good sushi can be made by a couple of friendly kids in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I can't lie. Being in Cleveland, I didn't expect great sushi but when this place opened, I was really excited in hopes that it would be good.   This place is very reasonably priced and my friend and I came here for a quick lunch. The service was great and everyone was really friendly. The restaurant is so cute and it is super modern, not what you would expect downtown.   I got the jalapeno yellow tail sushi and a crab mix, both of which I enjoyed and I was so full afterwards! I would def recommend this place and I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I ordered carryout before I left for work tonight and walked over to pick up my food. I walked in and when I realized there weren't any japanese people rolling the sushi, I didn't have high hopes. But, I loved my meal and will definitely be going back.  I was talking to the owner and (her son?) and they were extremely friendly. I can't wait to go back and actually dine in. I had the vegetable maki combo and the miso soup. The vegetable maki combo comes with a few pieces each of asparagus and red pepper roll, green bean roll, and spinach and carrot roll. All of thse were different than what I'm used to, but I enjoyed them all! The combo also came with 1 inari, which was good. My only regreg was that I should have asked for low-sodium soy sauce- whatever they gave me was probably regular and was too salty. I also got a miso soup (TIP: pretty sure if you eat there, it's free!) and i liked it... it's miso soup, nothing complicated or fancy.  I'm glad they'll be open daily starting mid July!! Can't wait to check them out again! The owner also said they're working on their liquor license to serve some alcohol!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place very much, 3 way reverse cowgirl is my absolute favorite. A little understaffed."}
{"text":"I moved from California to Northern Alabama and I miss good sushi!  I'm in town on business for 4 nights and I had dinner from this place 3 out of the 4 nights.  It is THAT good.  I found it on my first night in town when meandering the neighborhood around my hotel.  It's a small family run business at the Prospect end of the lonely Colonial Market Place.  The sushi is fairly priced, but not cheap.  My order: ELS Roll: Tempura shrimp and avocado roll, topped with Salmon Salmon and Avocado Roll  They use the freshest, buttery, melt in your mouth Salmon.  They are generous with the Salmon portions on the ELS roll, too.  Their rice is sticky and fluffy but not mucky or mushy.  The avocado was ripe and creamy.  The flavors melded together in the best possible way.  I'll see them on my next trip into town."}
{"text":"This is a hot spot for lunch downtown, but I think many are underestimating the date night potential of this place. The sushi is fresh, well made and among the best in town. A great price as well (less$ and better sushi that Sushi Rock).   And what really makes it a great date night is that it is BYOB. Take out or dine in, the owners and chefs are very welcoming and personable."}
