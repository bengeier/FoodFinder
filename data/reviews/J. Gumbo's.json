{"text":"Had the jambalaya for lunch and green onions added on top for no additional charge. Portion size is good but taste was nothing special, underwhelming in fact."}
{"text":"Awesome. Period. Everything is great. There is food to satisfy everybody. Spicy, medium, mild, seafood, vegetarian....ect. Friendly staff and quick. I make sure to come here every time I visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"First thing I asked was if the crawfish etoufee was spicy and was told no. The only seasoning they used was black pepper so, yeah it was spicy, and the crawfish was the size of my fingernail. They only used two kinds of seasonings on their food, black pepper and Cajun seasoning. Creole/Cajun food is about flavor not spice. I been here twice...first and last."}
{"text":"Awesome bowls. Try a sample before you order, but everything I sampled was great! Bowls are big and filling."}
{"text":"Where is the seafood ??? Sorry but I'm from the south and as a restaurant calling your self j gumbo atleast make one with crab n shrimp and offer amazing food but I'm seafood head very very disappointing I was soo excited and ready to pay $15 for a bowl of real seafood gumbo but I guess I gotta make my own ....I love trying new restaurants in the city n I call it as I taste it"}
{"text":"Drunken Chicken gumbo was on point, perfect amount of heat and lots of flavor. Quick and easy, and they let you sample the different options to see what you like."}
{"text":"Great service, the girls were fun and friendly and let me sample a couple gumbo! Tough choice, but went with Jean Lafitte. Will be back, thanks! 
Bonus, smoothie place next door."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise, food was awesome!   Service was great too!  Couldn't decide on what to choose at first, they offered samples so I can tryout my choices.  Finally decided on the Drunken Chicken, just enough spice to have my taste bud going and craving more with each bite.  Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"The service here is great. The Staff is friendly and very helpful. If you like spicy food, this is the place to be. Oh though it is spicy, the food is oozing with flavor... topped with sour cream- YUM!!! This is a must try, if you have never been!"}
{"text":"The gumbo taste/was burnt, the rice in the jambalaya was VERY over cooked and taste like sticky mush and the dish was not hot and had to be put in the microwave twice....just not good at all"}
{"text":"Awesome.... they let you sample everything if you ask so you can customize your gumbo. Bumble bee and drunken chicken are the best!!! Will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Everyone was friendly and extremely efficient! They have Zapps potato chips which makes them all the more better! This is a great spot to check out"}
{"text":"Drunken chicken was awesome. Friend said the voodoo po- boy was great as well. Clean and friendly service. Drove 30 min to try it and will make the drive again."}
{"text":"The portions were very fair, not too much not too little. I had the voodoo chicken, I was hoping it would be spicier but I still thought it was very flavorful. The person helping us was very knowledgeable and they let us try little samples before we purchase it."}
{"text":"Soooooo good! It's quick, you can take it to go or eat there and incredibly delicious!

Also you can sample all the different options if you've never had it before!"}
{"text":"Food is incredibly good. There are 3 levels of spiciness. It comes with rice and an additional $1.00 if you want sweet cornbread. I recommend getting the drunken chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Yelp as this restaurant was advertised as delivering to my address. Received email confirmation that the order was received by the restaurant. Waited for an hour and forty five minutes before calling the restaurant to check on the order. The woman said that although she received the order they do not, in fact, deliver to my location. Didn't call to inform me.

Just a heads up, if ordering delivery online I would follow up with a phone call the confirm."}
{"text":"First of all they have vegan options! The food is very tasty and my taste buds are more than satisfied!"}
{"text":"Downtown Cleveland has the best restaurants in Ohio but sometimes there just isn't time for that. When it comes to quick takeout, J. Gumbo's is one of my favorite options. As a vegetarian there are three options on the menu, I always choose the white chili with jalapenos, sour cream, and cheese."}
{"text":"First time at a J. Gumbo's location and I was pleasantly surprised. There were more items on the menu than I expected and the quality was very good. They didn't go overboard with the spices, the portions were generous, and they carry Zapp's chips (those who know understand.)

The only disappointment for me was that i couldn't find any dessert items. A nice praline would've been a great finish.

Still - nice to have a Cajun/creole option back downtown. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I can see why there are so many bad reviews about this place. I've been wanting beignets the whole day so I found this place on Yelp. I did see the reviews before coming here but I figured why not give this place a chance. I got the shrimp, chicken, and sausage gumbo. At first it tasted really salty, my fourth bite into the dish became overwhelming. It began to taste very bitter. Maybe they overlooked the roux and that's how the whole dish became bitter. I noticed that there were no okra, and that's a big ingredient when it comes to gumbo. But hey, everyone has their own style so I wasn't to judgmental on that. What I did find disturbing was that the holy trinity was not in the dish at all. The holy trinity which consist of onions, bell peppers, and celery. There were onions in the dish but not the other ingredients. That's a big thing in Cajun cooking, how can you not have the key ingredients that makes up some of the flavored of gumbo. I give this place a one star because the only thing I enjoyed was the Sprite and the beignets were okay."}
{"text":"For a Cajun gumbo restaurant, this blows other places to eat away even down in NOLA!! Outstanding food!!!! with plenty of great options. Place has great places to sit and enjoy your meal, as well as a very clean environment. Everything on the menu taste like it came directly from the bayou! That's a good thang!"}
{"text":"Food was really good surprisingly, especially after reading some reviews and like so many others I did notice quite a few tables of left over food that had barely been touched . Plus it wasn't as busy as I thought I'd be . But as I was in line a few people started coming in and the wait for the food and service became a let down  . They had only ONE person working the place. He had to be cashier , busser , waiter, cook , AND drive thru . Like wth ? Lol and because of that he wasn't the friendliest to put it simple. But after all that and I finally tried the food , it was DELICIOUS . I got the voodoo chicken , buffalo chicken, and gumbo all 3 for 10.99 . That's why I'm giving it 4 stars . Can't beat that"}
{"text":"If you are in the area please stop by this place! The gumbo was on point and the shrimp po boy hit the spot! No complaints from me. Everything was excellent. The staff was extremely nice and helped me out with the menu since this was my first time here.  I will definitely be going back soon! ( Probably tomorrow lol )"}
{"text":"My husband has passed by J. Gumbo's many times and constantly says he wants to try it.  Today we stopped in (after our visit to Walmart next door) and were pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant has a nice selection of Southern goodies---po boys, red beans and rice, jambalaya, street corn, fried okra and more.  My husband loves Southern cooking and this is the next best thing to his mother's cooking..."}
{"text":"This food is soooo delicious! I have had the bumblebee stew mixed with the drinker chicken as we as the bot on chicken mixed with the chicken zydeco. Both entrées are superb! You must go there"}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place and left dissatisfied. Drove clear across town, baby and husband in tow. Sampled the gumbo and it was terrible, so I decided to try something else. They were out of rice and the jambalaya was dry. My husband enjoyed the toast we were given which was the bread used for po boys. The employees were nice and the restaurant itself was nice. I'll never try this place again. $21 wasted."}
{"text":"I don't know Cajun too well but this place was tasty for this rookie. I was traveling for business and desperately needed some salad on the side though. The response? \"This is Cajun.\" Which I gather meant they don't serve salads.  I laughed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I guess they were out of gumbo for a few days and they just got it back.  Totally worth the wait.  Chicken and sausage gumbo that reminds me of what you would get at someone's house in Louisiana.  Not the thick stuff that most restaurants have.  They even have Zatarain's File' on the tables."}
{"text":"Just HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! I waited for someone to take my order for 20 minutes and no one was in sight! It's was just bad. I tried calling but there was no answer. I am very disappointed with the staff and the owner. Whoever was working today should be checked upon so no other customers have to deal with my situation. I would not recommend this place unless you want to wait for an hour for someone to take your order."}
{"text":"Well I live near by and be waiting for this place to open, thumbs down, very disappointed had the gumbo and it had way to much onions I thought I was having French onion soup, but the best of it was the smoke sausage! That's it! Oh and it came with French bread instead of corn bread...really?! Come on chef! Corn bread is not expensive!  
I won't go there again I'm big on first impressions."}
{"text":"So I was super excited. Even thought the drive thru was an awesome twist. Then....I ordered the \"gumbo\". Or rather sausage soup. No shrimp no chicken no nothing just rice and sausage....very disappointed. The food taste like gumbo by Campbell's Soup...sad why no shrimp?  Or anything else for that matter"}
{"text":"Absolute the worst I ever had ever!!! It's more like burnt stew at the bottom of the pot!!! Even the bread was gross!!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the friendly lady behind the counter. She asked us our preferred \"heat level\" and offered us samples of everything. Every sample tasted better then the last! We ended up with the jambalaya and the drunken chicken over white rice, with cornbread on the side. I could write a whole review on just the cornbread it was that good. Definitely will be coming back it was such a good all around experience!"}
{"text":"The people working were nice. Sad they were out of beignets, but the jumbo gumbo was good. It just needed okra! The crawfish cheese dip was really good too"}
{"text":"They didnt have a cook, everything was reheated in a microwave. Same person on the register and preparing food. Very disappointing and the food was disgusting. Should not be called cajun food!"}
{"text":"I have tried bourbon and red hot chicken. The bourbon chicken is very flavorful. The employees are very polite and helpful. I knocked off a star because the sodium content in most of their entrees is very high."}
{"text":"For a little chain type place, this place really packs a punch. Had the Jean Lafitte open face Po'Boy and it was awesome. Sampled some other stuff and there were a lot of great flavors - will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food comes in frozen and they warm it up, not what you'd want cajun food to be. It's steam table food that sits in there all day."}
{"text":"Looks like Mardi Gras taste like Kentucky 
A pork free Cajun restaurant is like a beef free steak house"}
{"text":"The food was great. I dined with my boyfriend tonight for Fat Tuesday and we split the 2 types of chicken in one bowl deal. We chose voodoo chicken and bourbon chicken with cheese and a few shakes of the Cajun seasoning...both were delicious and the voodoo is spicy but not out of control. The two dudes working were attentative and friendly...they let me try a few types before making a final decision. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I checked out the menu and all of the dishes have a lot of sodium...with the gumbo coming in at 3,500mg! My recommendation is to offer smaller portions, especially during lunch, because I cant imagine eating here and heading back to work. Keep up the good service and it should do great...best part--open until 9pm on week nights...for those of us living downtown, this is a luxury."}
{"text":"I liked the concept of this place but didn't find that the food was authentic.  I tried the gumbo and drunken chicken together.  The gumbo was a little watery and lacking the true taste of the rue."}
{"text":"After eating at J Gumdo's it brings me back home. I have traveled all over the world, grow up in the South. This is some fine eating. I will be back many times."}
{"text":"Gumbo was top notch.  Went on Fat Tuesday and they were very busy and got my carry out order right and on time.  They were very polite as I was double parked and they got me out in time.  Again, the Gumbo was just great."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly great!!! The food has tons of flavor and seasonings!! I had the crawfish it is now by far my favorite!! The crawfish aren't rubbery at all and there's lots of them in the dish! My husband had the voodoo chicken his favorite lots of spicy and seasoning. My son had the drunken chicken he said it was really good a little spicy for him but couldn't stop eating it! My daughter had the bourbon chicken it is the least spicy dish they have it kinda tastes like teriyaki. The red beans and rice oooh yeah the best I've had so far in Vegas! All the dishes are served in bowls over rice. You can even get different dishes mixed together if you wish or have them all separate. Its not a big restaurant and sometimes they run out of dishes but thats only because this place is that good!! Get there early so you can get your favorite dishes! They also  let you sample each dish to see which one is your favorite but I believe every one will be your favorite! Hope this place stays around for a long time!! By the way we've been here twice in two days thats how good this place is!! Lol!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! I ordered a giant jambolya and bread pudding. Right after I finished the gumbo and half way thru the bread pudding I got ill. I felt like I swallowed a dozen giant earthworms. I spent the ENTIRE afternoon in the restroom throwing up and- well I'm sure you can guess what else. $17 LITERALLY IN THE TOILET! My sister & my nephew had to rush to get me some Pepto and thankfully thats all it took to make me feel better. But every time I pass by that place I have to hold my stomach. Do not waste your hard earned money here!"}
{"text":"Been here many times and not one complaint. Staff has always been extremely nice and food portions and incredible. I've had Bourbon Street Chicken, Drunken Chicken, & voodoo chicken all have been amazingly good. They definitely have me as a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Stopped in after visiting Winterfest on Saturday.  We were heartily welcomed and encouraged to try many generous samples before deciding what we wanted to order.  We got 3 meals to share amongst 4 people, and it was more than enough.  The Zydeco chicken was probably the most popular for our group.  I appreciated the way the menu is divided by heat level.  The portions are enormous."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Such a different taste, and a great downtown location.  And it's fast.  Love the Bourbon Street Chicken and the Shrimp Etouffee, and with the combo, you can get them both."}
{"text":"The lack of customers should've given me a warning sign but an optimist that I am and my love for southern food told me to give this place a chance. 

It was a good thing I only ordered the crawfish etoufee because i had a feeling all their food would be the same...pre made and microwaved. The crawfish etoufee should've been just called etoufee because I didn't see a single crawfish in it. The gravy tasted like Campbell tomato soup. The bread was soggy and just plain sad. I would've had a better meal at Burger King for $7.99. 

If you're thinking about eating at this place and you're sober, don't."}
{"text":"Awesome first experience at cajun food. Warm and welcoming staff. Gave us samples to try coz we looked really lost. Portions are enough for 2 people. Price is awesome. And the food was SOO flavorful!! Definitely will recommend and come back for more. The gumbo was my favorite."}
{"text":"Came from LA for a business event.. Took a few days to explore the city. Stumbled upon this little gem! Dave took great care of us, the place was spotless, and the food was incredible! So much selection, which we were able to sample, and had such a pleasant experience start to finish! I totally recommend this spot for some good'ol Cajun treats with a great price point. The cornbread was off the chain as well.. Super moist, great flavor! My husband and I both loved it!"}
{"text":"The food is OK, but the value is terrible. Basically your paying for a lot of rice and a little bit of everything else and if you want to add cheese, sour creme and peppers then your adding another $2.  Basically paid $9.50 for a big pile of rice.  I think I've had vegetarian dishes with more meat than this."}
{"text":"Well this place is to gumbo what potpourri is to flowers #fake.  They are using Zatarain processed products & selling it. The name is really misleading. Should be call cajun bowls. Unless you start selling real gumbo change the name. Black eye to real soul, cajun & creole food."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad. However, wasn't all that either. I'm an avid home cook, and I felt that my gumbo is much better, so their just ok. I came once and never felt obliged to come back in. The service is very friendly and quick, the place is quite clean and all. But the food wasn't impressing me too much. It was pretty cool how they use rice, sour cream and cheese to compliment their gumbo (same thing I do at home) but the gumbo itself was underwhelming. Now if you don't have close access to gumbo, you may love the place, since they have plenty of diffent options to choose from. This is like the McDonalds of gumbo, too commercial and I'm guessing they heat up a bag of frozen gumbo and serve it. Their only around $8, so I think it's worth a shot, good luck!"}
{"text":"J. Gumbo's does pretty much everything right. The menu is simple, but bursting with flavors. The staff is super friendly and looks out for you when you seem indecisive or a little confused. 

I've had the Bumblebee stew and the shrimp etouffett and both were fantastic. The spice level wasn't at what I was expecting and the etouffett was a little spicier than the stew. I like things hot, so I was a little disappointed when I had to add hot sauce, but no big deal! Also, a friend ordered the drunken chicken and was weeping over the spiciness, so maybe I just need to go for that next time. 

The portions are filling and the leftovers are great! Nothing wrong with anything here, really!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to NOLA twice and we love the food there. It is hard to find a great southern hospitality restaurant in LV and we stumbled upon J Gumbo's. A small, local restaurant that we are so happy we came across. I got the crawfish etoufee and he got the jambalaya and rice and beans to go. The portions were perfect and it wasn't pricey at all. I am such a foodie and I recommend anyone who wants to get a taste of New Orleans to try this place. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Checked out this place when the line at the new Chipotle was too long...and glad I did! Pretty simple place with a lot of choices. I always get something spicey anywhere I go, so the voodoo chicken was right up my alley. pretty good size portion for the price too! staff was very friendly / helpful, and fact i live dwtn, I will definitely return"}
{"text":"The food is 3 stars. I'm pretty sure I had everything on the menu other than the voodoo chicken. Food is good. Service is a 5! I stopped in for lunch and they were out of gumbo, and the drink fountain was not working.  I will definitely have a do over just because I loved the guys there."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it... But it just wasn't good... This is more like a chain restaurant. I had the crawfish Etouffée .. It had a canned sauce taste and there was one crawfish. My friend had the white chili... It was under seasoned, thick and pastie. Mine was under seasoned as well I used the hot sauce to add flavor.. The free beignet was ok... I probably won't be back. We should have known when pulled up and saw the drive thru..."}
{"text":"Interesting place. They offer a variety of gumbo, etoufee,  and po' boy sandwiches.  With such a large menu, it was a plus when they allowed me to sample a few options. It was not a plus when the didn't have the gumbo with shrimp.. especially when a large part of the menu calls for shrimp.
I will give them another chance to redeem themselves. What I had was that good.
Oh, I forgot... You can skip the cornbread."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Drunken chicken and bumble bee stew was my choice of meal today. Perfect amount of spice and very flavorful. Rice, chicken, corn all cooked just right. Nice staff, I mentioned it was my first time the guy hooked me up with 4 sample cups to pick my passion. Skip chipoltle you won't be disappointed. 

Priced nicely for the portion size."}
{"text":"I found this place accidentally when I went to get a smoothie at tropical smoothie. Wonderful food and better customer service."}
{"text":"Overall, I was really happy with my experience here. When my friends and I mentioned that it was our first time in, we were asked what level of spice we were comfortable with and given samples accordingly. For me, this was a big deal because I have a certain \"sweet spot\" when it comes to spicy food... Some spice is OK, but anything above that and my food is all but inedible. 
Anyways, after trying the samples, I got chicken zaitico and my friends got the drunken chicken, the jambalaya and etiolle. Everything was served over rice and had a piece of bread included. My chicken was great and both of my friends liked their food as well, but I was left wanting the rice to be a little thicker and hold up the sauce a bit more. I also felt like the menu was a bit limiting. Not a lot for first timers. Definitely for a niche market.
Overall, I would return, and I think that the problems I had would be solved by a little more experience with the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great Gumbo house!! Friendly staff and awesome food!! And especially if you're already downtown"}
{"text":"Never tried gumbo so decided to check this place out.

The waiter- an older man- greeted us and gave us samples. He was really friendly and fun to talk to. 

I tried the honey sriracha chicken with voodoo chicken in a brown rice bowl. The honey sriracha chicken was sweet with a nice soft kick. Voodoo chicken had a lot of spices, it was hot AND delicious. Chicken for both were so tender, soft and amazing. Mix bowl was $2 more on top of a regular price of $7.95. 

It was a very satisfying meal, affordable and delicious. I am now a gumbo fan and will come back to this place for more!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! We got the Mix it up bowl! $10.99 for three flavors! Good size bowl! Both my husband and I had doggie bags! We had the Jean Lafitte, crawfish étouffée, white chili, drunken chicken, bumblebee stew! Along with yummy beignets and cafe au lait! Delicious! Get some Zydeco playing and a muffuletta and this place is even better! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com!!! My family and I went in and ordered up almost the whole menu. Tornado potatoes with the BBQ shake are to die for! The bumble stew has got to be my fav dish on the menu. The po boys are good too.  Owner is super sweet as well. Overall 12/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Cute local Cajun place,  I ordered the combo of gumbo and voodoo chicken served over brown rice.   The gumbo had great flavor but it only had one small piece of chicken and one small piece of sausage in it, the rest was just broth,  huge celery pieces, and bay leaves.   I don't like picking bay leaves out of my food!  The voodoo chicken was shredded chicken in a very spicy tomato sauce, it was good but it tasted more like marina sauce with tabasco added instead of a traditional cajun sauce.  The chicken was also dark meat so that was a negative.  Overall this was a good inexpensive meal but it could use a little improvement.  I was also surprised they had white and brown rice instead of cajun or yellow rice."}
{"text":"I came in for a takeout order I haven't made it home yet to try my food but the service and the way I was treated in the cleanliness of the restaurant I absolutely loved"}
{"text":"Pretty decent for fast food, but I can see that you would be disappointed if you're expecting fresh restaurant quality. The service was great and we even got a few free beignets. :)"}
{"text":"Came here on 3/23/18, looking to try some gumbo. I've only had it once in my life and I had try it again. To my luck they let you order a kids size that is just a bit over half of the cost of a regular one. So I went ahead and tried both their regular gumbo and the voodoo chicken which is supposed to be the spiciest and from a scale of 1-10 I would rate it a 6 in heat. But I am in to spicy, no shrimp was included in the regular order but you can ad it for 2.99 or so totally worth it. You must try their voodoo poppers stuffed with cream cheese, bacon and corn!! Mouth watering delicious! Also your gumbo will include a drink and a side of either French or hot water corn bread, I am telling you skip the French bread. If you've never had hot water corn bread you're in for a nice treat. As far service they have some young kids upfront sometimes who are trying hard, so be patient it's worth it. I think the owners showed up while we were there not sure, but Toiya was an absolute sweet heart, make sure you ask them to explain the menu if it's your first time they have a whole spill."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had the Chicken Red Hot in the Hot & Spicy category. Basically they have different chicken dishes they pour over rice. Categories Sweet & Mild, Medium $ Zesty, Hot & Spicy. Also available, Appetizers & Po Boys. Samples available before you order. I did think it was a little tacky charging extra for toppings (cheese, jalapeño,, sour cream.) Overall Very Good"}
{"text":"Came with a friend to this shopping center, he wanted gumbo, i didnt, but once i was inside, i completely changed my mind. OMG this place is so delicious. We were greeted by a nice gentlemen who was very friendly.  YOU CAN SAMPLE BEFORE YOU BUY.  I ended up getting the Jean Lafitte and my friend the Gumbo. We were both happy, they brought us out a free dessert. Completely happy with this place, glad i stumbled upon it by accident. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is excellent.  If you want something different in CLE, this will not disappoint.  Drunken chicken, bumblebee stew and Voodoo chicken are all very tasty."}
{"text":"Where to start? This place was fantastic! If you enjoy creole, southern style gumbo, this is THE spot. You are able to sample every single gumbo selection you'd like. All range from sweet to spicy to verrrry spicy! The service was great and they have locations all over. I did try the other location here in Cleveland and it was just as good too! Although they are known for their different gumbo recipes, the cornbread is to die for! Can't leave without that! I highly recommend mixing the bumblebee stew and the drunken chicken over rice! Perfect amount of sweet/spicy! Loved it here!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for gumbo. I went one time last week and I been back 3 time. My dad came out from New York and he loves it"}
{"text":"We ate here on 10/13/15 and the food was okay. They were out of Gumbo until Thursday they said. We ordered the Drunken Chicken, Jambalaya and Crawfish Étouffée. The Drunken Chicken was too salty. The other two dishes tasted like they had been sitting out for a while and not as fresh. Not the best Jambalaya I have ever had. I was truly let down, not what it was hyped up to be. Tables were dirty and not cleaned, and the floor was dirty as well. They were nice as far as service but the food quality was not great. Don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"To go order was missing an item, had to go back and get it. Crawfish Etouffee had maybe 6 pieces of crawfish in it. Also ordered the Red Beans and Rice. Quality and taste was not what we expected. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I walked in around 10:45am, thinking I would get a cafe au lait and some beignets.  Coffee wasn't brewed yet, but rice was ready, so I decided to have lunch instead.  Counter person wisely recommended that I get the drunken chicken in a to-go container because portions are huge.  No kidding!  I couldn't even close the lid until I ate some of the food off the top.  I got two lunches for the price of one.  I'm taking a star off because they didn't have coffee ready in the morning and the dining room smelled like cleaning products.  Four stars for pleasant service, good food,and huge portions."}
{"text":"Melissa was straight up awesome! We had a group of 16 of us from the Renaissance. Everything in the area closed early and we called to get the hours here. She said they closed at 8, but when she heard we couldn't get there until 845, she immediately offered to stay open later to accommodate us. We didn't even have to ask! 

And when we got to the restaurant, she easily could have tried to get us out as quick as possible. Did she? Of course not. When we told her we had never been there before she offered each of us samples that were absolutely delicious. The bourbon chicken was sweet and delicious and the voodoo chicken was to die for. While we sat, she chatted with us while she worked and offered us anything she thought we might need. I can't remember another time I got such great service anywhere! 

Thank you Melissa for such a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Went in today to order take out..

The gentleman working the counter wasn't incredibly friendly and seemed lost, even after I tried making jokes. After I paid he comes up to me about 5-10 minutes later to ask what I ordered.... 

I was a little bummed to see that the food is ready to go and even watched them throw some things in a microwave. 

I ordered the drunken chicken and gumbo. The drunken chick had some good consistency but wasn't mind blowing. The gumbo was colored water.. Sooooo disappointing! This is just another place to give me a reason to stay with Lola's. 

They get two stars because they had beignets andddddd those were pretty awesome. But I won't be driving out of my way here for those."}
{"text":"Excellent energy as soon as we walked in! The menu was straight forward and had a Louisiana feel to it! And the food ahhhh man is incredible and a good buy! Come through!"}
{"text":"My family and I visited on a Saturday evening during the Cleveland International Film Festival. Not one of us was sure what to order. The folks behind the counter gave us samples of every dish we wanted to try. We ordered Drunken Chicken, Zydeco Chicken, Bumble Bee Stew, Bourbon Street Chicken, and Voodoo Chicken (and my son had corn bread, too, which we split). Delicious food, and generous helpings. Just right on an evening in early spring."}
{"text":"My expectations for this place were a lot higher (from reading the reviews and looking at photos) before I drove up and saw a drive-thru lane. This place isn't on par with McDonalds or anything, but it's not about to replace a trip to Lolas either.

The red hot chicken is labelled as their hottest dish, and it's an enjoyable buffalo-sauce based building heat that makes me think of wings without the mess. The crawfish etoufee, which I expected to be one of their stronger dishes, was pretty dismal, with minimal heat and a rather bland roux, and large finger-sized pieces of celery. Both dishes were large for the price (under $10/pp), and all dishes seem to be served over rice- a disproportionate amount of it.

Service was okay- it's a walk-up style spot. Dining room is clean with Vegas and New Orleans-themed art on the walls. Tables have a variety of hot sauces available, along with a store-brand bottled version. 

For those outraged about the lack of dishes like alligator, crawfish, etc on the menu, their website offers an explanation that references their commitment to quality and inability to guarantee fresh-sourced specialty products. I'd rather they be straightforward about what they can execute well rather than have dishes they know won't be their best effort."}
{"text":"I was attracted to this place by its sign outside announcing vegetarian/vegan options. While there weren't a whole lot of options, I did enjoy the vegetarian white chili. It had a good amount I'd seasoning without being overly salty. Also it's a convinent location relative to the convention center."}
{"text":"Delicious. And has a drive-thru. Just sayin. 

What brought me here was finding food that my mother-in-law could eat. She had surgery on her gums and was indefinitely subscribed a soft foods diet. My husband and I were eager to find her something delicious that wasn't mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, or a smoothie. Magically, we both agreed that jambalaya or gumbo would be a great choice,  but we didn't think there was anything nearby, quick, or convenient. 

Enter J Gumbo's. A quick Google search of \"gumbo las vegas\" and off we were. We were excited to find that the location had a drive-thru since we planned to order the food to-go and bring it to my in-laws'. 

The initial impression was that the food had to be good. The dining area was packed; something visible from the outside. 

The snag we encountered was in the drive-thru experience. It moved slowly that day. In fact, there was probably at 30-minute wait between when were handed out first bag of food and when we were handed the rest of it. Here's the thing: when the rest of the food came out, the person who I imagine was a manager or the owner, popped out of the window, apologized profusely for the delay and insisted we take an order of fried okra with her compliments. But that wasn't all. When we arrived to my in-laws' and began unpacking the food, we found that we were also given a fresh batch of the food that was first handed to us. I appreciated the acknowledgement from the team of the issue, but appreciated even more the effort to which they went to make things right. 

The drive-thru wait aside, the food was great. My father-in-law normally eats about half of his food and doesn't say much about it while he's eating. However, he scarfed down his entire portion of jambalaya with several comments about how tasty he found it. 

I intend to return soon when the next cajun/creole craving hits."}
{"text":"I love love love their food service counter people are awsome forth time here in one week and tried four different items and its been an amazing experiance each time. Ohh yes did i say i love thier food"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place. I only make gumbo once a year, on New Years Day, and I was hoping this would satisfy my cravings in the interim. I ordered gumbo, white bean chili, and beignets. The gumbo tasted like the roux was bad, it had a slightly burnt, bitter taste to it. It was really thin and I had 4 pieces of sausage in it, a lot of rice, and not much else. The white bean chili was okay, nothing to write home about but much better than the gumbo. And the beignets might have been okay but I gave them to my daughter. I was too put off by the fact that there was more powdered sugar than dough, and it was everywhere in the bag. I'll deal with the casino smoke and stick to the Oyster bar at Palace Station."}
{"text":"If you like cajun/creole cooking then you've found the place!

The chicken red hot and drunken chicken are my go-to choices.  Flavorful and rich sauces with super tender chicken smothering rice in a very large portion size - perfect for the chilly Cleveland weather.

J. Gumbo's has been my favorite find for 2014."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped into today just driving by. 1st the staff was so nice and informative, offered us samples cause I said I cannot handle spicey food at all. I ended up getting the bourbon street chicken, and it was to die for. My new favorite spot in town great staff and great food with a great environment can't go wrong!!!!"}
{"text":"Drunken chicken is fantastic, this is great food for a chain, plus this dish is low in fat"}
{"text":"Holy shit. My first Cajun food in Las Vegas and I loved it. I got the crawfish étouffée and my husband got the gumbo. We split both entries between us and couldn't get over how tasty both dishes were.
Ignore the Yelp warning that this restaurant is closed. They're open and I hope they stay that way for a long time."}
{"text":"Right outside of terminal tower, nestled on the side street of euclid avenue across from the huntington building is this gem of a creole restaurant.

If you're a cajun fan this is the place for you, heck if you're a seafood fan this is also the place for you. The seafood Gumbo is delicious, they actually let you try samples of the gumbo prior to ordering your final dish. Thats a plus for me because i was able to savor the ingredients put into each gumbo, i was able to make the incredibly difficult decision of \"choosing\"a gumbo.

The workers are so beyond helpful, they are friendly and attentive, they know all the ingredients, helps a ton with allergies. The manager kept the service fast and friendly. 

Definetly a 5 star for me!!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent, everyone is friendly and went out of their way to make sure that your experience at Jgumbo is as great as the food.
I had a shrimp poboy...and the shrimp were some of the best that i have ever had. I also had a bowl of gumbo with the shrimp and crab legs which was amazing!
I followed up my meal with a slice of bomb sweet potato pie and I was all set."}
{"text":"awesome place!! great service and truly delicious food.. 

I had the bumble bee stew and drunken chicken, lots of flavor.. A must try in this place!!!

Also had the crawfish dip!! yummmy"}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say amazing food and super friendly staff. Being a fan of Cajun cooking I will be coming back a lot! This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Yummy and a lot cheaper than flying to NOLA.  Crawfish cheese dip,  crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice and drunken chicken all delicious and almost makes you believe you are in NOLA.  Very friendly service and COMMUNITY COFFEE.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  I had a mix of Gumbo and Bumble Bee Stew.  Wow, was that ever good.  Service was excellent as well.  Wish there was one of these close to where I live."}
{"text":"I love this place already. This is my first time coming here it's kind of small but it's decorated beautiful inside it reminds if your in New Orleans. The staff is very nice. The guy that worked there told me and boyfriend we could sample all of the food not to many places in Vegas would let you do that. I ordered the Crawfish Etoofee it was really good they weren't stingy on the crawfish neither it came with toasted bread and rice the rice was cooked perfectly. They also gave us complementary beignets that were nice and hot did I mention to say the prices are really good very adorable I will diffently come here again"}
{"text":"Love, love, Luuuurve J. Gumbo's!  I took my spicy food fanatic friend here after i tried it for the first time and knew she would enjoy it. The same friend who will squirt sriracha sauce on every bite of food if she could.  I knew she'd love this food!  She took one bite of the Chicken Red Hot and immediately the tears started rolling!  Thats a sign of a delicious dish.  She loved it as much as I!!  We've already made plans to go back.  

I'm such a fan that I've already set aside the evenings I'll be getting take-out for dinner.  The staff is wonderful.  Friendly and fun.  All around a great experience!  The heartburn is so totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I went to J Gumbo's since I work nearby and wanted to check it out. I went after the lunch rush, and the staff was very friendly. They offered samples of various menu items and were helpful with their recommendations.

I went with Chicken Red Hot. The chicken is pulled apart and simmers in the sauce, and it's not bad. Tastes a lot like Frank's Red Hot with some other spices. They put it over rice. It comes with a pretty bland piece of french bread on the side.

It was a nice size portion, but it really just is the chicken, sauce and rice. They put a little bit of scallions and blue cheese on top, but I guess I wanted a fuller dish or maybe just some veggies so I feel like I am getting some nutrients in there.

But the place was clean, in a new space with a convenient location, and they have more on the menu, so I will likely give it another chance in the near future."}
{"text":"I was born in New Orleans and my mom cooked cajun food regularly. I've also been to many restaurants that serve gumbo and they vary quite a bit. The gumbo is good but maybe not the best ever. In any case, the buffalo chicken is good, the voodoo chicken is delicious! I thought the red beans and rice was actually pretty good. I also liked the jambalaya. I must warn you that the voodoo chicken is spicy and gave me quite the heartburn but I knew it would. I usually eat the Bourbon chicken now and have fallen in love with it. Me and my sister eat here regularly and both love this place. I have also brought numerous friends here and they have loved it as well."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong when they encourage you to sample it all?!?  WOW!
I loved the bumblebee stew and  the zydeco chicken!  Others in my group had  the efftoufe and other various choices.  The staff were entertaining, informative and very friendly.  We all left full and very happy.  The bill was not shocking either!  Definite plus!"}
{"text":"I work downtown and usually try to meet friends for lunch at least once, per week.  I am not a picky eater, so I usually let my dining companion choose the lunch destination.  On this occasion my dining companion chose J. Gumbo's.   I am not a big fan of steam table type restaurants, but thought \"what the heck\", I'll give it a try....am I glad that I did!   We purposely arrived ahead of the noon lunch crowd, and we were graciously greeted by not one, but several employees and promptly offered samples of the various food items.   I had previewed the menu on-line, prior to going so, I arrived thinking that I would get the white chili.   I tasted it and began to place my order, the employee behind the steam table gently encouraged me to try a few of the other offerings and I am glad that I did, everything was tasty and well prepared.  I opted to combine 2 dishes (over rice).   I had the bumblebee stew and bourbon chicken, topped with cheddar, sour cream and jalapenos.   The portion was more than generous (I took almost 1/2 home to enjoy later).   We dined in and were visited by the employee that served us, asking if we needed anything and if we were enjoying our selections (we were:-).  We were also visited by the very friendly catering manager.  Both were very polite and not at all instrusive.   The only disappointments were 1)  the \"french\" bread that accompanied the dish, it was kinda dry and tasteless, I'm sure that it is the same bread used for sandwiches, so once toasted and topped with tasty fillings, it's probably ok.   2) we were offered the toppings mentioned above without knowing that \"each\" was $.50 extra.   Not a big deal, because overall the meal was good and well worth the price.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy creole food. I wanted to find a place that had quick takeout and was different from the typical Asian or pizza. J Gumbo's was definitely a great choice.  I got the drunken chicken because so many people on yelp recommended it. I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and recommend it as well. Haven't had creole food since I was in NOLA like 10 years ago and this hit the spot for sure. It was a little spicy imo, but I will admit I'm a weakling when it comes to spice. Great value as well. Drunken chicken was $7.50 and I was pretty full after eating half of it."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and allowed us to sample all of their offerings before ordering.  All of it tasted really good and definitely would go back if in area."}
{"text":"I have been to J. Gumbo's twice. The only negative things I can say is that their hours should be longer and that there should be more shrimp in the etouffe and more crawfish in the etoufee. Prices are great, serving sizes are large, and staff is friendly. The food does have a heat to it but it's a good thing. As close to real Cajun food as you can get in Ohio."}
{"text":"I generally trust Shannon's reviews, so I am a bit disappointed that their Gumbo is heated up from bags, if she is indeed correct.

But what the hay. I am sitting here in the office, it's 9:42am, and I absolutely CAN'T WAIT to go there for lunch today. I am so stoked about eating that gumbo in 3 hours.

Given that, I guess I should actually write a review.

It is true that there are better gumbos, but they are probably not priced at $8. They have a ton of other things there too, which they encourage you to try, but honestly I've never ordered anything else. One fun thing you can do with the gumbo is ask for them to put it over their jambalaya instead of the rice. They love doing that. I think it's a buck more that way. 

They also have sweet tea on tap. And the staff is really nice, and the service is quick, even when the lines are out the door (which is often).

Easily my favorite place to go for lunch in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I'm going to give a 1 star because I have not eaten there yet.  I went in last week with my husband; there was 1 lady sitting at a table with a lap top...no one else around.  We waited....we stood...we sat...no one was around.  The lady with the laptop may have worked there, I don't know.  It felt cold and poor service, especially for a fairly new business. We just left. Lola's here I come!"}
{"text":"This place just opened and I didn't really think to give it a shot until my friend said let's go. It's a cute little spot with a walk through to tropical smoothie. I tried the voodoo nachos and they were great. I would say a little over spiced but that's ok. My friend got the voodoo chicken bowl the only problem she had was the rice seemed like instant rice. She got bread with her meal and if the bread was fresh it would of been 10 times better. Friendly staff and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great find. Good food. Definitely will come back when I'm in town.  Friendly server who gave me some samples to help me make up my mind.  Really flavorful food and you can also find less spicy options on the menu.  Also noticed that although the line might look a bit long at first, it moves quick."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area, and found J. Gumbos when going through different restaurants in the Las Vegas area on Yelp yesterday. As soon as I saw J. Gumbos, and the food that they had to offer, I knew exactly where I was going to be going for dinner last night. I ordered the Voodoo Chicken and Beignets, and was highly impressed. The food was delicious, the portion sizes were good, and the prices were beyond reasonable. I love that J. Gumbos has a drive thru, and that I am able to get a home cooked meal at fast food speed. I definitely will be back soon to try all of the other meals that J. Gumbos offers!"}
{"text":"Build your own bowl style creole place, kind of like a cajun Chipotle. Get the standard choices of white or brown rice, meat, and toppings. You can add chips or cornbread for a few extra bucks as well. Personally, I go with the white rice and drunken chicken, topped with cheese and sour cream. The food is very flavorful and appetizing. Portion sizes are large, and pricing is relatively cheap. One of my choice lunch spots downtown. 

I also really like the decor throughout the place. There's a recycled looking art piece on the wall with homage to Dan Auerbach from The Black Keys, so that's cool. It's usually clean, and they have a consistent lineup of workers that are always pleasant."}
{"text":"It's never a good sign when you walk in to a restaurant with an empty table full of uneaten food.  Even worse when you yourself then waste your money and leave full uneaten plates. The food tasted like a chain smoker is the chef.  Over blown spice on the Buffalo chicken poor boy left it inedible.  The enormous amount of salt in everything else was even worse.  Worst gumbo joint ever."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I have many fond memories of being in New Orleans and this food really hit the spot.  Totally worth it.  Great prices and friendly staff.  Also you're able to sample anything on the menue before you buy it.  Beignets to die for."}
{"text":"Had the drunken chicken which was amazing! Service was excellent! They let us try samples of a few different spice levels before choosing one. Huge portions and super cheap prices. The cornbread is moist and compliments the meal. Atmosphere is New Orleans festive! They play jazz music and the place is decorated in mardi gras style. I was with a party of 4 and everyone loved their meal! They even gave us beads! I will be back often."}
{"text":"This was sadness with a spoon.  This was like walking by a homeless man with a dog. This was like an ASPCA commercial in a bowl. I think my boyfriend would rather manipulate a clogged toilet by hand. 

It all started out one hangry afternoon.  Upon online recommendation,  we drove a half an hour to get here. We had high hopes. 

Turns out.....this is just not the place for a sober,  hungry,  hopeful person. This is better for an \"I've hit rock bottom\" sort of a day/life.

My first eyebrow was raised at the sight of the the drive thru, BUT we don't judge a book by its cover. Maybe this was like a mediocre looking woman with a miraculously beautiful interior, right? 

The second eyebrow was raised when the only other customer returned his bowl and asked if they could microwave it. BUT maybe the man just likes a good burn, right? 

Now, I personally only have two eyebrows....but if I had more,  they would have risen up.  

The voodoo chicken was perhaps legitimately under a spell. The seasoning had a flavor best articulated with the word \"spoiled. \"  

The bread was not fresh. The gumbo was not hot.  All of the food was extremely salty. 


The diet coke was really good though, and neither of us got diarrhea. So, there's that. 

Andouille sausage?  We do not."}
{"text":"So impressed.  First,  the food is bomb. So flavorful and plentiful.  Really inexpensive.  I'm addicted but to add to that. ..the two lovely gents working are just sweet as pecan pie. So helpful.  I told him I needed a minute to look and he started giving me samples.  I ended up ordering the drunken chicken and Crawfish etoufee. Add in the cornbread,  two pieces please cuz is amazing,  and some sour cream and onion.  Bill was 12 bucks! ! Should have been plenty for two meals but I ate dinner then got up a couple hours later and polished the plate.  Wish I found it sooner. b Only in town a couple more days!"}
{"text":"I started off loving this place, then it became a bit inconsistent. A few times the rice was a bit overcooked and at other times, the chicken was a bit dry. I gave it a break and then went back after about 6 months and everything seemed to be fine again. 

I like this place... I'm just more happy with it when it's consistent. The other cons... I'm not crazy about the huge portion of rice and smaller portions of everything else. I don't like how cheese and jalapeño peppers cost extra... but what can ya do? :/

Good things: clean restaurant... very well kept. Good food."}
{"text":"This place was ok. There were three of us here on a business trip and we stopped in there for lunch. The crawfish cheese dip was cold. And then we got the gumbo. The gumbo was good but a bit salty. The best was the coen bread. All in all it was ok"}
{"text":"I would stay clear of this place due to health concerns. I went through the drive through and the lady was nice, but pulling up to the window I noticed another lady licking her fingers as she was working in the kitchen (no one had gloves on). After the lady licked her fingers she served the people inside (pray for them) and I watched her roll up my bread or beignet (whatever it was) and placed it in the oven. Once I received my food I just looked down and there was a blue rubber band in the jambalaya. Asked her for a refund which she apologized and kindly gave to me. The problem here is not really the customer service but the hygiene."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. The only thing they actually cook in house are the beignets so if you're looking for authentic this is not the place for you. When they first opened the service we recieved was GREAT! Now I'm sitting here with a completely different sentiment after walking into an empty restaurant and waiting a few minutes for someone from Tropical Smoothie to finally acknowledge me and come to take my order. As his cellphone was to his ear and he was wearing a Tropical Smoothie shirt, I didn't think he was talking to me when he mumbled \"What can I get you?\" I placed my order while he continued his phone call with no apology for the rudeness. He then left to take an order at Tropical Smoothie before coming back to prepare my food. I didn't see him wash his hands but I'm praying he did so as I was looking at my phone writing this review. As I'm on my lunch break I'm too far in to back out now."}
{"text":"I got the jambalaya. It took awhile to be brought to the drive thru window. It was also overly salty. Flavor was there but way too salty. I couldn't even finish."}
{"text":"If it were just OK, it'd be K Gumbos. If people mostly came here to use the bathroom, it'd be P Gumbos. If it were a late night spot, it'd be ZZZZ Gumbos. And if it were orgasmically good, it'd be O Gumbos. It is pretty good though.

What to get: Gumbo
What not to get: Gum Disease

How to improve: Visit Zydeco in Houston and start serving up some dishes like they have down there!

This is excellent gumbo, with a decent sized portion for a pretty affordable price. I was surprised, considering this is right in the heart of downtown (with not much parking option around when it's busy), and I was happy that I didn't have to pay a proverbial arm and a leg to try this stuff.

I thought it was really good. Not the best I'd ever had, but certainly a five-star dish with good value and one that I will return to again and again when in Cleveland.

And if they also fixed your dogs and cats for you, it'd be Spay Gumbos. Whereas if it was a kiddie watch center, it'd be Play Gumbos. If it was a pet adoption agency it'd be Stray Gumbos. If it were owned by the band that sang \"How To Save A Life\" it'd be Fray Gumbos. And if the owner was really good in bed (he's fairly average) it'd be Good Lay Gumbos."}
{"text":"My friend recommended I come and try out J Gumbo's and when I walked in they had a nice vibe going & music playing! The cashier was personable and welcome. She explained the dishes with passion and made suggestions! Definitely a gem in the city!! Can't wait to come back for the jambalaya!!"}
{"text":"Wow- cold evening comfort food can be so good!! We planned to come up here for a couple of weeks now and this evening we arrived around 5:30. The staff were great about explaining the grades of spiciness and the combinations of entrees.
My husband had the crawfish etouffee and I had the voodoo chicken po boy. My sandwich was full of spicy chicken and onions with a great sauce and fresh bread. My husband really enjoyed the flavor of the crawfish, though the crawfish could be a bit more plentiful.
We shared the serving of 3 beignets. Hot and fresh!! Powdered sugar all over the place!!

We enjoyed the quick service and fun atmosphere.

The benefits also include lots of free parking!"}
{"text":"J Gumbo is of the most criminally under-patronized restaurants in downtown. Compared with the Chipotle next door, J Gumbo has (somehow) even better portions, prices, and way better choices. 

Seriously, just stick your head in the door and inhale. The intoxicating smells will convince you that this is the place to eat more than any review could."}
{"text":"This is the best Cajun food I have had in years.  The portions are large.  In fact I take home enough to take to work for lunch the next day.  The food is just as good the next day.  I had the jambalaya and fried okra both times. My boyfriend had the gumbo one time and crayfish creole one time.  He had the boo doo poppers both times.  Once you go you will go back again and again.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Spicy, saucy pulled chicken served over rice with cheese on top? Huge, heaping portions of tummy warming goodness? Samples of anything you want--for free? And impeccable, friendly, smiling service? 

This is a recipe for a great meal. 

The food is delicious. I tried the Chicken Red Hot and the Drunken Chicken over rice--both were spicy, seasoned well and comforting. I think both could have been spicier, but I also understand that they're catering to a very large crowd of different (and weaker) taste buds. Plus they put hot sauces on each table AND you add jalapenos to your dish. And honestly, everything was perfectly seasoned. The Red Hot Chicken is for those who love spicy, buffalo sauce. The Drunken Chicken is more of a cajun flavor, just as spicy, but not as vinegar-y. 

Besides the food, the service is what really shines. First of all, in the line (which was busy) the guys don't rush you while you're trying to choose from all the delicious-looking items on the menu. They were happy to give samples and even suggest an item that I hadn't considered after hearing how much I love spicy foods! Then, the gal at the register was sugary sweet--then she was even nicer later on, when she brought us takeout boxes, bags and chatted us up. 

The line does get long during lunch, but it moves quickly. So don't let that defer you--the parking situation on the other hand... now that's always unforgivable. Ha."}
{"text":"We are from Los Angeles!! We know great food! Dave is the Man! Get some amazing food at a great price! Hot Spot for Cleveland!  I almost forgot... The Corn Bread was so moist and delicious! For all you Health People they have Gluten Free Too! 
Thank you Dave for making my wife and I feel like family!"}
{"text":"Ordered the red beans and rice. More rice than red beans. Lagniappe was a beignet. House hot sauce is very tasty. I'll be back. Community brand ice tea and coffee. Very Louisiana."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious. I myself ordered nachos (can't remember which one I'm pretty sure the N.O.,LA. ) I was satisfied as soon as I opened the box. My chips were smothered in delicious drunken chicken , sour cream and jalapeños. My mind felt like this is something back home, insanely smothered nachos. They were good but they should thing about making their own chips and then it would be off the wall. The chips were the standard round corn chips you get at sports events. 

I also got the bumblebee stew. It was soooo good. So sweet and yummy. I was surprised there was no protein in it but that could be what makes it appealing as well. Over all I give that dish 5 stars. Maybe watch out for the onions as they can be big and chunky. The stewed tomatoes are bomb.com 

Drunken chicken was excellent. Spicy but not too spicy where you want to stop eating. I like the little green onions. A lot. Keep doing that. Adding sweet corn to it just a little would be yummy too. 

Got the red beans and rice and the beans were so good. Tasted like grandmas beans. I don't even care if they're fresh they're just good. The sausage was good. This dish would be my least favorite of the 4 things I ordered. Not even saying its bad though just more on the mild calmer side of the spectrum. 

The free beignets? Are u kidding? I'd by those things by the dozen. 

Can't wait to be back!!!! And please don't be out of gumbo and voodoo chicken next time ....

ALsooo amazing prices only $30 for all the food I ordered! They could probably raise the price and I would still go ..."}
{"text":"This place was a Referral by a San Diego native!  Apparently the owner is from San Diego...  On a cold Vegas night, the Jumbo Gumbo was exactly what I needed.  The spices reminded me of being in the Boot.  I will definitely be back to try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.  The key thing about J Gumbo's is that it's bayou style shredded chicken over rice with a slice of baguette, NOT soup or gumbo (you can get that but it's not the main product).  Everyone I introduce to this place has the wrong idea thinking it's some kind of soup place and every time they leave completely satisfied with a new favorite lunch spot.  Literally everything on this menu is clutch, but extra clutch would be the Honey Sriracha chicken.  This place has to be the single most underrated establishment east of the Mississippi.  The one guy who works here every day around lunch time is always excited and hands out samples left and right, he actually saved me some cash by recommending one chicken that combined the flavors of the two I normally get.  Can't go wrong at J Gumbo, it's a can't-miss destination downtown CLE."}
{"text":"Good service, friendly staff. They do have a drive through, but we ate in. Its sort of a sit down fast food place. We had our order taken to our table in a real bowl and silverware with a complimentary buttered piece of bread. 
We had the crawfish and cheese dip, we thought it was great! We also had the red beans and rice and the crawfish etouffee, they were pretty good but I'm not a fan of their rice. Their sweet tea is also pretty good. They also gave us one free beignet with each meal.
I'm glad we finally got to try it. I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in this new J. Gumbo's for dinner with friends (we were on our way to a sub shop and noticed this new place on the way).  I hadn't heard of it before and wasn't sure what to expect, but was really impressed.  Great staff willing to let you sample as much as you like and make suggestions based on your tastes.  Clean and nicely decorated facility.  The Drunken Chicken is especially delicious--I had it along with the Bumblebee Stew over rice.  A nice, quick and tasty alternative to the typical sandwich shop, and I'm glad to see new places opening up downtown.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat downtown. The drunken chicken is great as well as the (excuse my spelling) Jean la Fiet. You get a ton of food....quality food at a great price. Get to this location and grab a seat on the rail facing the street and that's all you need for lunch. One of the best places to people watch"}
{"text":"I would say this place is more geared to visitors.

The Crawfish Etouffee was delish. The beignets were a bit burnt. Otherwise, I support this Black-owned business."}
{"text":"Great quick lunch. I tried the Drunken Chicken with white rice. Very good place to have a quick lunch or get delivery."}
{"text":"I went in again to try the place out again, and am glad I did--it was hasty of me to judge an inland Cajun spot based off their crawfish dish (which you don't see much of outside of the Deep South). The bourbon chicken was excellent, as were the red beans and rice. The price point was very good too--you'll get out for about the same price you'd pay at chipotle.

Thank you for bringing a taste of the bayou up to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Their take on a fast soul food joint. They even have a drive through. I was so excited about that until I tried the food. 
Everything is pre made in advance. I love gumbo but this place lacked by far. Don't do the gumbo it's all watered down didn't have okra in it either. We also tried the crawfish etouffee and that was ok better flavor than the gumbo. But again don't expect a chef in the back. It's all heated up in a microwave. I get that it takes time to simmer the flavor together but not here. There was no love. Palace station oyster bar is still my number one to go to for creole love in a bowl."}
{"text":"Paid J. Gumbo's a visit today. My mouth was watering for some of this fast type creole food. We had these restaurants in Columbus, Ohio so I was happy to find one located in Las Vegas. Ordered the street corn and Voodoo chicken. The street corn was horrible and for some reason very tart. I'm from California. I know good street corn. The voodoo bowl was so stingy for $10 and was very mediocre. The rice tasted like water. I won't be returning. Pretty disappointed that I drove 20 minutes for this."}
{"text":"Food was tasteless and my body was reacting to the food before I got home. Just made it to the Bathroom in time. I will not be eating there again]"}
{"text":"Came here a little late. Around 9:15 pm. The staff was the most unhelpful staff I've ever encountered. I've never been here and didn't understand the menu and asked for help or suggestions on how to order. The cashier just stated that you just pick. And kept quiet as my friend and I stood there staring at the menu. Was told that they were out of gumbo only after I tried to order it. I eventually ended up ordering the Drunken chicken and Voodoo Chicken mixed bowl. Food was actually good. The only reason for the 1 star is for lack of service. I being in the service industry hold high expectations from others. Especially from a new business. Oh and the fryer was broke so I didn't get the free Beignets which is one of the reasons I drove all the way to other side of town to try.  Again I give the food 4 stars. Service 1"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. Walked in and the girl working (alone) was too busy texting to help us decide what to order. She said they were out of the first three things we tried to order at 12:30 on a Thursday. After taking our order, she went back to start making our food (hair was not pulled up, she did not wash her hands, prior to preparing our food). After the food came out, we had to ask for napkins which she went to Tropical Smoothie next door to get. She was too busy eating her lunch at the front counter to bring out the rest of our lunch.

And the food is not good. Not good at all. Hot does not equal good. A simple gumbo and red beans and rice shouldn't be hard to do well when you only have 10 items on the menu."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. After reading a few reviews we decided to give this place a try. I ordered  the \"gumbo\" my bowl wasn't  even half filled and the food  tasted so bland and something  that came out of a can. My husband ordered the voodoo  chicken poo boy. The bread was stale and hardly any filling in it and had a weird after taste. Definitely  not going  back."}
{"text":"I recently stopped in this new J Gumbos for lunch.  The staff was friendly and invited me to taste samples from the menu.  My taste buds don't tolerate the very spicy foods, so the server made some suggestions to me.  I decided to get the Gumbo. As someone who loves New Orleans style gumbo, I'm very picky about flavor. Bad gumbo is usually the rule, rather than the exception. But this gumbo was very very good.  So good, I'll come back and order it again!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in quite a while, the restaurant is under new management. The food I ordered was still pretty much the same with the exception of the Drunken Chicken (its not on the menu anymore) I would definitely come here again when I'm craving some good ol' creole food! I suggest ordering the gumbo. The food is slightly different from the previous owners and the portions seem smaller, it's still very delicious! 

I do NOT recommend the beignets. It's a staple with creole food and the ones I ordered from here were tiny, flat, hard, and crunchy... 
The previous owners made the beignets to perfection."}
{"text":"This place has been closed all week!!!! No sign. The smoothie place bae this door has no idea what's going on."}
{"text":"So excited to see this place being built.  We came in right away and all the bugs were not worked out yet.

So we gave it a second chance, the first time I think they were so busy they ran out of gumbo the girl behind me said she has been there 3 times and yet to have the gumbo.  So we settled for Voodoo Chicken it was good and surprisingly HOT!  We also got the Crawfish Etoufee, very good had a few times and will get again.  The Gumbo is good my man liked it a lot gumbo is just not My thing, but the flavor is great and tastes like down in LA.

The flavor is great the service is great and it is a more fast food kind of place so for that being said it is great.  It is not LA but for Vegas I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Let's just say I didn't even get the chance to oder my food because the cashier had a toothpick in her mouth and was picking her teeth and eating whatever she picked from her mouth. That did it for me I walked out."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for dinner one early one weeknight evening. It was about 5:30 pm - so the place was mostly empty except for one table. As I was perusing the menu, David who was working that evening - engaged with me and gave me several samples to taste of various dishes. I was torn between trying the Gumbo and the Étouffée - so I ordered both - sans rice to make it more low carb.

Both were tasty - the Gumbo was fair, not the best I've had, and a little watery compared to other, thicker Gumbos. One could try and make the case that the lack of rice made it thinner, but I don't think adding cooked rice would have absorbed that much liquid. The Étouffée was pretty darn tasty though. And the texture was nice and thick, yet smooth.

I'd come back here again and try some of the other dishes, as well as eat the Étouffée again! Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas is finally speaking my language; New Orleans food at a price point I can consistently afford and with a drive-thru no doubt. The restaurant was clean and inviting. I asked about how long to prepare as I was on a 30 minute lunch break. The food came out quicker than expected. 

I tried the Jambalaya (chkn&sausage) and the Gumbo (ckn\sausage). Both were very good but very similar. Just the right amount of heat to make you think you're in New Orleans. After reading through the menu, you can do a jumbo gumbo with or without crab for an extra $4 or $8. 

The big bowl entries are very filling and come with a side of bread and a drink. I felt it was a good value and will definitely come back again. I live in the northwest part of town and my litmus test is would I drive across town just to eat? The answer is yes. I'll have to make a return trip to try the beans&rice and poboys. Better idea; is to open a location in Centennial Hills for the military transplants and you would not be sorry."}
{"text":"This place was the shit.
I went in as soon as they opened for dinner and I was starving but I've never been there before. I'm in town for vacation and wanted to try it out.
I was NOT disappointed.
The staff was friendly and accommodated my needs effectively.
They let me try a bite of everything I asked for!!
So you know what you're getting yourself into..
The price is fair.. They give you a good portion.. Me and my date did NOT finish our food.
Everything was DELISH.
If you're in town visiting.. it doesn't hurt to try this place."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good gumbo and beignets! Very clean restaurant and fast service. The restaurant is connected to a tropical smoothie. Love the Vegas and New Orleans decor! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Voodoo Chicken Are On Point. Voodoo Poppers Are Amazing. Great place To Eat.! I'm From Baton Rouge, Louisiana And It's Definitely Pretty Good. Been Looking For A Good Cajun Place To Eat For A While. The Etouffée Isn't All That Good To Me Because It Doesn't Have Much Seasoning But If You Don't Wont Seasoning And You Like Bland You Got It."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for the night did not want to have the whole restaurant atmosphere. Stopped in and was nervous only one other customer. Said heck with it. Got drunken chicken and wanted more. They say night is slow and lunch is crazy."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is AMAZING!!!!! We are in Cleveland for a convention. We live in So Cal where good food is expected. Anytime I travel I always yelp places to find a good place to eat. And again...i was not let down. Everything we had was sooo delicious!!! I had the drunken chicken and the bumble bee stew. The chicken was sooo tender and flavorful!!!! The $1 cornbread is amazing tooo!!!! The staff is extremely friendly. I was trying to decide what to eat and the woman behind the counter gave me 5 different samples and i didnt even have to ask!! I highly recommend this to anyone! I have been to New Orleans. And had plenty of delicious food there too and this place seriously just as good if not better. And the price is absolutely reasonable. I could go on forever but i think i got it all covered. Go here. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"J. Gumbo is my favorite Cajun restaurant on the planet. I first heard about it in Cleveland and have been hooked ever since. I was excited when I found out there was a location opening right down the street from me and almost in tears when I saw that they weren't getting much foot traffic. Now, the location is under new management and doing much better than before. Las Vegans need to keep this joint open and thriving because the food is on point!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this by accident, being a Florida native not used to 30 degree weather I decides to find refuge from the storm. Food was great but the service even better. I had the bumble bee stew and the creole ratatouille. If you are in the Cleveland area, definitely stop in and grab a bowl. Portions are large atmosphere is warm."}
{"text":"Combining spicy, stick-to-your-ribs comfort food with an enchanting aesthetic, J. Gumbo is a hearty treat on a chilly winter afternoon. The staff are keen and accommodating, and they don't shy away from filling one's bowl to the teeming brim (gustatory bingers delight). The other day escapees from surrounding offices were raving about the vegetarian Bumblebee Stew, a savory, sweet medley of peppers, corn, and black beans brought to life by a swirl of cream sauce. Try it with all the fixings: sour cream, cheese, jalapeño.   Corn bread, that stalwart heat neutralizer, is available for a buck at the wraparound order line's terminus: it's essential for rounding out the flavors and seems always to be freshly baked and hot. Grab a wedge or two to savor. You might also take a moment to marvel at the voodoo-heavy wall art. Most intriguing are the green men in snappy black suits on crooked planks who seem imported from a mysterious bayou. There are others, too, but you'll have to scope them out for yourself. Take a respite here from the ice and wind, dear itinerant grub-craver. You've time warped into the gothic south upon entry, so do enjoy it. You might just see  Faulkner ambling by amid the ghosts and the tangy, bright flavor clouds rising from the steaming bowls on every table."}
{"text":"Got a discount over at KSHP.COM.  I've been taking my Phillipa girlfriend out lately to foods from around America. I introduced her to soul food(Ribs, greens, cornbread) and this last weekend it was Creole food.  She had the gumbo while I ate a P'boy sausage sandwich.  The sandwich was stuffed with plenty of sausage and the bread was excellent.  There was also a side of Cajun mustard which was very good. The gumbo was surprisingly tasty.  I really didn't expect this quality of Cajun food from this tiny hole in the wall.  The people were also very friendly and make you feel like family.  There was a nice hello upon entering and a goodbye when I left. Overall, another great find in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is so good sometimes I drive downtown just to grab a plate. I usually mix and match the bumblebee stew (spicy sweet corn and beans delicious) and white chilli(spicy and perfectly seasoned), top it off with jalapeños.. grab like 3 pieces of cornbread cuz its almost as good as the food they offer. 
Oh and every single person that works there is wonderful"}
{"text":"Had to stop by the J. Gumbo's as it was one of the favorite Cajun style places we used to go to at OSU. 

I think they have several locations in Ohio but not too many anywhere else. 

They serve New Orleans style dishes in a fast food kind of atmosphere. The food here is always good and consistent across franchises. This is a hardy meal that will certainly fill you up with rice, bread, your choice of gumbo, jambalaya, dip etc. You also have a good variety of flavors, from spicy to sweet. You can have your food here or you can take it to go.

There is a small outdoor patio area that is just off the sidewalk of Euclid.

Service was friendly."}
{"text":"First off, great hospitality. My mother went to do the pick up, couldn't parallel park, and all we had to do was call and they brought it to the car haha. We ended up ordering: red beans and rice, bumble bee stew, jambalaya, voodoo chicken, and the etouffee. We did order cornbread too but it did not end up in the order, sadface. It was a refunded cost at least when asked!

I usually try to avoid writing reviews for chains since they are about speed to me. But this place... Wow. Should have gone here sooner. Do not miss out! My favorite was the bumble bee stew - sweet but also with a kick. It got my tongue doing a happy dance."}
{"text":"Great that they have vegan and vegetarian options, and the portion size is huge. But I'd actually prefer less rice and more of the saucy stuff!"}
{"text":"The crawfish etouffee is delicious here! As a Texan who visits New Orleans every two months, I was pleasantly surprised. The crawfish etouffee had the right amount of spice, not too much but not too little. The entree was the right texture; sometimes it can be too gummy. The gumbo was okay. I've had better in New Orleans, but it was alright. 

I was disappointed with the service. I ordered through eat24 (yelp's app), and the promised pickup time was 5:37PM on a Monday evening. I arrived a couple of minutes early, and the staff had not even begin putting my order together. They scrambled to get my order together, which only took a few minutes, but in my mind, the order should've been ready. There was only one couple in the restaurant, so it wasn't busy. I was also asked to pay in person despite paying via the app, so make sure you remember if you previously paid!

Etouffee Crawfish $9.50
Combo with Gumbo $2.00
Root Beer $2.25
Tax $0.00
Total $11.75"}
{"text":"Have always had great food and service here for the type of experience it is. Grab it to go if I'm around the area just for later. (Feel bad for people who had bad experiences because it's always been tasty and lasts me 2 meals.) Try a bit of Drunkin Chicken to go if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This food was amazing!!!!  Re-opening was busy but after tasting the food it was well worth the wait!!! The staff was very professional and the Chef, I believe his name is Chef Smokey was very kind. Chef Smokey gets  an A plus for creating such delicious food!!! Vegas needed something different and this is it!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm primarily vegetarian, but sometimes I just need some chicken.  Also, while I've been to New Orleans, I've never had truly authentic gumbo, so this is primarily based on how it tasted.

First, I love that they let you sample any of the gumbos.

Next, I love that the menu is designed by least to most spicy.

I ordered the Voodoo Chicken, served over white rice with a slice of garlic bread. 

The chicken was super tasty, full of flavor and perfect heat.  I would order it again.

The garlic bread as some have stated was a bit crumbly, but it was still good.

Overall, it's a great quick fix for gumbo."}
{"text":"Second time being here. They have different spicy level you can choose, which is nice. My favorite is the Crawfish Etouffee. If you want something quick and tasty, this is the place to go. Will be back more often!"}
{"text":"Cute simple quick friendly and very Tasty.
I loved the kick in the generous  helping of Voodoo Chicken.
This place is a must if you a want a quick flavor filled  meal on a cool or cold night!
I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"J. Gumbo's was pretty good. fair prices. Friendly staff. and the portions of food was pretty good and tasty as well. I was just disappointed when I found out they had no bread pudding. which had been on the coming soon sign for months. I will be back soon to have more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"They seem to run out of food really quick. There was no gumbo and the ran out of beignets. Both seem to be best sellers too. The jambalaya was good tho."}
{"text":"Drove by and had to turn around to check this place out. Catfish po boy was excellent, great bread and the fish was lightly battered and seasoned right. The red beans and rice were a good choice for a side dish. Also sample the crawfish etouffè which was great. Great customer service great experience overall."}
{"text":"You like heat?  You like quality chicken?  Get the voo doo chicken.  Enough for two meals, bread, and soda for $10.  Restaurant was clean and friendly service.  Sign said under new management so if you heard bad things.. this was my first time and it's solid!!  Mine was pretty hot - be warned."}
{"text":"Ok so we gave this place a second chance and called ahead to see if they had gumbo this time. If fact they did so we drove across town and went inside. The guy inside remembered us from last time and the offer to redeem themselves with free meals. 

So, we ordered 2 gumbos and a child portion of red beans and rice. 

I am sorry to say that the best part of this meal was the Community Sweet Iced Tea. That is a Louisiana Staple. My husband had poured himself a coke and took a sip of my tea and decided to dump out the coke and get tea. 

Anyway, when our food came my husband took 1 bite and looked at me and said \"You are not going to like it, it's bitter\" He was right, I didn't like it. It tasted nothing like the gumbo from central Louisiana where I lived for 22 years. I did however take several bites to try and figure out what the bitter taste was and I couldn't put my finger on it. 

The red beans and rice also did not taste right. My 16 old just spit it out. For a baby that's no big deal but when I tasted it I wanted to do the same. 

After not being able to stand anymore we just left. We didn't even try the beignets. 

I gave the extra star because of the service and the iced tea."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Today I decided to order \"kid size\" portions of multiple favorites so that I could sample a variety.  The shrimp Po-boy was really tasty.  I got everything that typically comes on it except mustard.  It is what I consider pricey, until I tasted it.  Then I was okay with the cost.  It looked at tasted rather authentic to what I'm used to; although I was hoping for the shrimp to be fried in different kind of cornmeal coating.  Still, it was very good.  For the cost of the po-boy, I wish it came with a small side of 'something' (ex. okra, hushpuppies, fries).  I also ordered:  gumbo, crawfish etouffee, red beans & rice, and jambalaya.  My favorite was the crawfish etouffee; seasoned nicely with a nice portion of crawfish.  The other items were good, but right on the verge of being too spicy for my taste.  I learned today that the \"kid size\" portion is basically the \"kids meal\", and is actually of significantly good size.  Considering how much I ordered, I will have some tasty meals for the next couple of days!  The fountain includes Barq's root beer.  The service was friendly.  My order took a while, but it was worth the wait in the seating area (plus the beverage fountain choices helped cool me down in the Vegas heat).  Next visit I plan on ordering the street corn, fried okra, along with other choices.  I noticed a catering postcard at the counter.  It listed the items available, many already available at this restaurant.  I noticed the catering choices included dirty rice!  I wish it was offered at the restaurant as a side dish (I asked, no go as of this review).  The gumbo here is not my local favorite, but the crawfish etouffee is number one on my list of choices thus far at this establishment.  I would like to see more items offered on the menu such as:  catfish meals (only as a po-boy currently), hushpuppies and dirty rice."}
{"text":"Guy behind the counter was super nice. He asked me if it was my first time and immediately asked my spice level and gave me samples. EXACTLY what he needed to do. I was hooked. Ended up getting a drunken chicken po boy and it was very good. The food temp could have been a liiiittle bit warmer and I was a bit disappointed in the price. $7.95 turned into $12 quickly when it came to the combo. Still, really glad I stopped here. Has a very mellow and fun atmosphere. The music adds a lot :)"}
{"text":"Damn. Every single thing here is good! Yeah, we sampled them all.

Definitely rexommend the crawfish etoufee (NO SHELLS!!!) and drunken chicken. And bourbon chicken. And voodoo chicken (spicy)."}
{"text":"Morning order: Gumbo meal, Jumbalya meal, side of red beans and rice. 

Cost 25 bucks
Size: will feed the two of us for 2 meals
Convenience: Drive through although it did take a while.
Taste: I've had better. But I've had worse. If your looking for creole food for cheap this is pretty great.

Edited three months later:
I think the place is under new management. Waited at the drive through to no answer. Walked in to order. 
The tea hadn't been changed since the morning (after inquiring) way past the time control safety. After notifying the staff it had to be explained that that's a health violation. Once we arrived home, the food tastes similar but there is a lot less protein and veggies making the size a lot less remarkable. The food tastes good still but not anything noteworthy any longer. I hope it shapes up or I don't foresee it staying open which would be a shame."}
{"text":"Good food!! Reminds me of when I lived in New Orleans! I will definitely be going back for more!!"}
{"text":"Simple but very worthwhile great food. It is wonderful how you can mix and match as you order to make your own meal."}
{"text":"Very delicious jambalaya bowls so far. I've only had two with one being the drunken chicken. I can't recall the name of the second one. 
The first time I went, I had an order of the bread pudding which was ok. It was good but it didn't quite have as much of a homemade taste as the jambalaya bowls. I look forward to trying another one soon."}
{"text":"Reminds me of living in the Big Easy. Great food, great service, jazz, and Zapp's potato chips (which is the kicker)."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty, but they gave me a small portion. I paid $10 for half a bowl of jambalaya and the bottom half of a tasteless sandwich bun.  Bummer. Not sure if I want to give them another try.  I left hungry."}
{"text":"First the place was clean and Charles greeted us promptly and knew the menu... In reading reviews I was impressed that they had Chicory coffee - something I have missed since leaving New Orleans (Cafe DuMonde)... I asked for a fresh cup - they could not find it but was nice enough to make me regular - ... the voodoo chicken had amazing flavor - I will come back to try others.... A BIG PLUS was Charles - the other 2 employees  were to busy talking on their cell phones to care about customers..."}
{"text":"My friends and I may or may not have been *slightly* inebriated whilst hungrily walking to the Cavs playoff game when we stumbled across J. Gumbo's one fateful early Summer's night.  I dig me some Cajun/Creole so I had been meaning to check this joint out, with high hopes. And man, they did not dissappoint.

As we walked in, we were happily surprised by all the delicious menu options and had trouble deciding - thankfully the very friendly server offered us all free samples so we could decide.  I ended up with the Chicken Zydeco and my friends had the Drunken Chicken and Bourbon Chicken.  We all tried each others' dishes and loved them all.  The food was well balanced in both flavor and spice, and each hit the spot - oh, mon chèri, did it hit the spot.  All our meals were very proportionate, served with bread, and very economical.  A much better quick option than other restaurants in the area and certainly at the Q.

If you're craving something filling, hearty, flavorful, quick, spicy, cheap, or different (or any of the combination the above) you will be well served with this New Orleans style joint."}
{"text":"I had the gumbo here and it was AMAZING . I even had to go back the next day to get more . It was perfectly seasoned and was not at all short on meat . I WILL be returning ."}
{"text":"I won't even post a pic cuz I'm embarrassed I even stopped this evening to get anything & wasted my $15 on a bowl on watery mess... this was not gumbo to say the least. Got home thinking I was going to be in a for a good ol' meal but instead put that stuff in the trash ugh. Super disappointed. I need a refund."}
{"text":"Well that was a fantastic lunch! I work across the street from the downtown location of J Gumbos and I finally decided to give it a go. I was starving before my meal and luckily the line was not too busy (but filled up after I got in line). The location is right on Euclid, so there isn't parking per se but is pretty easily walkable if you are anywhere near Public Square. The restaurant itself had a nice modern rustic look on the inside and had enough seating for when I was in there but most likely gets packed at lunch time.
 
The lady in front of me was also a first timer and when she asked the server about certain dishes he was very friendly and even offered her samples, a very nice touch in my opinion. From reading their menu previously and reading reviews I had already decided what I was getting and didn't opt to try samples. I went with a half and half dish of the Drunken Chicken and also the Chicken Red Hot which comes over 2 scoops of white rice. I opted for the shredded cheese, sour cream and green onions on top. It also came with a small slice of bread to accompany the dish.
 
The Drunken Chicken dish was garlicky, Cajun, creamy goodness. The Chicken Red Hot was more of a buffalo wing sauce style that was actually the one I preferred of the two. I enjoyed the heat with my food and to be honest this one was 100% exactly at the right spice level for me. You are left with that bite that lingers in your mouth and the flavor which was fantastic. I must say the chicken in both dishes was melt in your mouth good as well. I very much enjoyed using the bread with dipping and I may try one of their Po' Boy sandwiches next time.
 
My only gripes were the container it was served in which was a Styrofoam box, I would have preferred a plastic box instead as the Styrofoam was kind of flimsy. I also wasn't aware that getting 2 entrees was an upcharge of $2.75 (I believe the menu on the wall said $2 extra for 2 entrees) which brought my total to $10.25 without a drink, kind of a pricy lunch in my opinion. Even with that J Gumbo's is definitely a spot I'm happy to have now tried. The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and all in all the meal was hearty and filling (would be really great on a cold Cleveland day). Get there!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. Thought I'd experiment so I got the jambalaya crawfish ettoufe and it's the best meal you can get. The workers are very friendly and they'll give you free samples."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Fast food. Menu is easy and authentic. Clean restaurant. The decor is very cute. They have neat materials about Louisiana and hurricane Katrina."}
{"text":"I have been loving this place since I checked it out a month or so ago, and it seems like the rest of downtown has caught on as well. 

The place was a ghost town on my first visit, and I said to my friend as we walked in: \"This does not bode well.\" But then we were both blown away at the delicious, truly spicy, flavorful, wonderful dishes we tried. We both love the Voodoo chicken, which, according to the hot sauce bottle scale, is the spiciest dish they have. 

We have both been back multiple times.... only to find our new \"secret\" lunch spot has a crazy line out the door all the time. Luckily, the line is fast, and the service is super friendly!

The cashier good-naturedly called me out the other day on the fact that I had been in there several times in one week. It's true: even with all the awesome lunch options downtown, J Gumbo's is quickly becoming my go-to lunch: cheap, fast, friendly, delicious! Plus, it's usually enough for lunch for two days. 

All in all, a very welcome addition to downtown!"}
{"text":"The drunken chicken is excellent! The crawfish etouffee is great as well, but very, very heavy on the stomach and very rich. I loved it so much that I ate it twice in a row, and now I can't eat the etouffee anymore. ): BUT, everything else is delicious, so I'll get over it. And if you like crawfish you should definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"The owner is very helpful and he's willing to help out anyway possible if there's an issue. I appreciate businesses like this. I was advised going in and testing the food out instead of ordering online if you're a new customer. The food is very tasty."}
{"text":"First time trying on a Sunday afternoon. No people in here. They're \"out of\" everything. Poor new girl was working by herself and knew nothing about the menu, how to work the register, how to run my card...we are always looking for \"good\" Cajun food in Vegas, but the service left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"It was OK I wish the shrimp was cooked a lil more and it was Lil watery, go service and it's convenient not long lines like other places just wish it tasted a lil bit more better"}
{"text":"This place is so ghetto! As we pulled up the girl working the drive thru was standing outside right next to the order menu smoking a cigarette with her boyfriend,  and really tried to turn her back and talk in her speacker for our order. Wth. Grossed out, no thank you don't need to handle my food. No thanks to this place, period. The girl with the red ponytail two thumbs down on your drive thru skills"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. This place has legit Cajun & Creole cooking off the las vegas strip but its worth the drive.  We ordered Jambalaya, red beans and rice, and topped it off with some sweet potato pie. Yelp reviews don't give this place justice."}
{"text":"Sign said it's under new ownership.  I never had tried it before, but I thought the voo doo chicken was very good.  It had some good heat to it.  Looking forward to trying the jambalaya and gumbo."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Did not roll their eyes as I contemplated the menu. 

After taste tasting almost the entire menu, I chose the bumble bee stew with shrimp. 

Cheap, delicious, and friendly. Great for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I was recommended to J Gumbo's by a friend and boy I'll tell ya it's for sure a good place to eat! The prices are great and portions are nice. We tried a ew different things and everything we had was good! And don't forget to grab some cornbread!  

Overall great experience with the employees and atmosphere is nice. For sure going to come back here whenever I'm in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"im from the south and they let a poor example of a GUMBO."}
{"text":"Came hear with my family and got a po boys sausage. Probably the best sandwich I've had in a really long time, only thing I'd say to change is to add onion and not to cut them in half or overstuff the food bc then the bread breaks in half on both sides. Not really a serious issue but just some regular feedback. Would recommend to a friend coming here!"}
{"text":"Wow, so good!!  I feel like I took a mini NOLA vacation at lunch time.  Super friendly staff and fresh homemade food.  The portions are generous, you won't leave hungry!!  I had the gumbo with add shrimp.  I will be coming here often."}
{"text":"Great downtown lunch spot! You will not need an afternoon snack because the portions are huge (enough for two meals for me). The staff is very friendly staff and more than willing to let you sample and help you decide what goes well together. My first stop there I tried the chicken zydecco with a bit of cheese, sour cream and jalapenos (note: toppings do cost extra). I've also tried the Bumblebee stew with Drunken chicken, which was a great mix of sweet and spicy tastes. Definitely recommend you give this a try if you're in the area. It's a nice change from all the sub places in the area."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for a weekend getaway and looking for some great cajun food. Saw J. Gumbo's on Yelp and decided to stop in. Tried the Drunken Chicken with Red Beans and Rice and Voodoo Chicken and they did not disappoint! Servings were huge, I took half of it home. Very reasonable prices. Our servers, Eric T. and Rayshawn T. were very helpful, attentive and friendly. They were great ambassadors for the business. We really enjoyed ourselves. What a great find!"}
{"text":"We both ordered the bourbon chicken which was very tasty! The staff is very friendly and sweet. The only issue I have is their inconsistency. I know they are fairly new and still working out the kinks. The bread pudding I ordered this visit was completely different from what I had on my previous visit. It was not executed in the same way, if I order something I expect it to be the same as it was prior unless it is improved. Also the bread they include with your meal has no flavor and is very dry. They should revamp that as it could be so much better or just do away with it. I stand wrong with my love for the bourbon chicken and that won't change. I just hope that stays consistent."}
{"text":"Great food. Great price. Had the Bourbon Street chicken mixed with the Bumble Bee stew and loved it."}

I'm settling on 4 stars, but I have so many mixed feelings about this place. 

The good: the space and the service are great. The girl at the counter was ever so friendly and eager to offer samples and her recommendations on what she liked. This combined with how quickly the food is ready are largely the reason I'm settling on 4 stars. The space is big enough so that you don't feel cramped when you stop in here on a weekdays lunch surrounded by business men doing the same. The menu also has useful descriptions for those that are unfamiliar with what to order, which I find really helpful

What confuses me about this restaurant is what they define as a \"po-boy\" To me a po-boy is a sandwich served on a crispy on the outside yet fluffy on the inside baguette topped high with some form of meat along with lettuce, tomato pickles, hot sauce and some cajun mayo. This place defines a po-boy as any of their soupy mains served atop a generic submarine bun. You can also get it topped with cheddar cheese, sour cream and green onions, and somewhere in the middle of eating it, you realize what was once a sandwich has become something akin to chili floating on top of a bun to sop up the liquid. Now this isn't a \"bad\" sandwich by any means, but I have never seen this labeled as a po-boy; it really is something else entirely. 

To sum up: is the food here tasty? Yes. Is the price reasonable? Yes. Is the service friendly and fast? Yes. Is this what I would consider to be authentic Cajun/Creole cuisine? I don't think so. That probably wouldn't stop me from recommending to others, but with the full disclosure not to come here if that's what you're seeking out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is very friendly and staff is courteous. We ordered a crawfish étouffée, catfish Po Boy, voodoo poppers and beignets. Etouffee tasted like home cooking and the crawfish weren't over cooked which surprised me. Catfish Po Boy came wrapped in fresh baked bread; which was delicious but lacked seasoning. So I hit the hot sauce; which wasn't hot at all. Besides the hot sauce, the voodoo poppers and the beignets were a little under seasoned. The beignets were rather dry... overall I'll definitely recommend it, just use tabasco if you want heat because their food isn't spicy at all."}
