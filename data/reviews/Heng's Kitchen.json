{"text":"We were looking for more traditional spicy Chinese food and Heng's really hit the spot. Heng's is in a food court inside the Mekong Plaza. Reasonable prices and good portions. We'll return soon."}
{"text":"I ate several times here. Every time the restaurant surprised me. All chef specials are amazing, and I enjoyed dim sum like pot stickers and mini buns. It tastes like real Chinese food since I come from China."}
{"text":"Wow. Easily 5 stars. 

Had to look around to find this place. Directions: it's not outside in the parking lot. You need to go into the main shopping mall titled Mekong Plaza. Walk down the hall and you'll see a food court. Heng's is to the left. 

I'm leaving this review because I was very impressed by the food here. I'm actually just in town, visiting from NYC. I have a favorite Michelin starred dim sum place I go to back at home, and this place can give my favorite spot a run for its money.

I got the lamb soup noodles (spicy) and the steamed soup dumplings. My girlfriend got the mapo tofu and another order of dumplings. The flavor was exquisite. And the lamb meat was actually a giant leg of lamb with the bone in. I've never seen that before in any Chinese place. Usually when you order lamb it's just a few chunks of chewy meat, but I was blown away by this guy's food. 

The dude who runs this place is also really nice, polite, and incredibly humble. I left a solid tip because SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I ordered spicy chicken and spicy gizzards. Taste really great! Just I went this Tuesday about 3:30 pm, they were closed. Don't know which day they close or just that day."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've been looking for authentic spots but nothing until today has come close to anything back home (MA). I only tried a couple of items today: hot and sour soup and Kung pao chicken. I've wasted enough money at other places that I only get one or two items to test food quality. Everyone should go here. You have to go inside in the food court to find it. This will be my new spot!  Cannot say enough good things."}
{"text":"Heng's Kitchen is a highlight for me whenever I'm hitting up Mekong Plaza. For some reason, finding really good food court food makes me happy - fast, cheap and amazing... what's not to like??

Heng's offers so many dishes, all pretty amazing. So much yumminess I've yet to try. Among two of my favorite things to order are the cold cucumber salad and spicy dan dan noodles (pictured below). 

The cucumber salad is crisp, refreshing, spicy with a perfect hit of sourness. The dan dan noodles are a treat with a good balance the balance of pork, noodles and fresh cilantro.

Service from the lil old lady is quiet yet sweet and friendly. I'll definitely be back again and again to try more of their food - just take a look at the image section of their yelp page... so hard to choose what to order since everything looks damn good!"}
{"text":"Don't let the food court appearance fool you.  Each dish has little mini-explosions of flavor in each bite!  Very good."}
{"text":"This is a very authentic restaurant in the Mekong food court. Just a bunch of tables with eager eaters.   It's helpful if you can read Chinese. The menu board was totally in Chinese.  The menu was bilingual. 
 
We ordered the scallion pancakes which were plentiful, a tad greasy and did not have enough of a scallion flavor.  
The fried spicy chicken was very good.  Not breaded--good,  not fried---good, but rather nicely saut√©ed with tons of peppers.  (We asked for it spicy)  

We also had the pigs feet in soy sauce.  I am the pigs feet fanatic but I felt they put too much Five spice powder and it was overwhelming.  I eat them latino style which is in a tomato base with onions, garlic and cilantro so the Chinese version here (which I have had at other Chinese restaurants including one in Paris)  did not impress me.  I bought most of it home and I will re-do them in a tomato base with some garbanzo beans---reworked so to speak. 
Finally, eggplant in a special sauce was really good.  We didn't touch the gloppy white rice which was served plentifully in a bowl---Too many carbs and not worth it. 

The warm water in a styrofoam cup was not a hit.  I guess they wanted you to buy sodas which we don't drink."}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome fried green beans, and super yummy cold cucumbers. Lots of good stuff here!
I go as a vegan, and there is plenty of stuff for me. My bf is Chinese so he makes it nice and easy when he orders it vegan for me."}
{"text":"This is a cool family owned restaurant where you see Mom and Pop working both in the front and the back kitchen. Usually come here for lunch since it is really close to my work place.

So far I've tried the Spicy Fried Chicken dish, the Spicy Wontons, a Spicy Chicken stew dish with Potatoes and some Potstickers / Dumplings for an appetizer.  Everything is pretty tasty and the food comes out hot and fresh.

Their menu has several types of dishes that our new to me and I have not had the chance to try them all out yet. Still not sure what region to call this type of Chinese food. It is not necessarily Americanized like most places. This is good!

Service is friendly and a bit on the quiet side. The dishes can take a little longer to come out when they are really busy. So expect a small wait at times. Good chance to play on your smartphone.

Located in the Mekong Plaza food court in the back left corner. These restaurants seem to come and go rather frequently depending on the how busy they are and the level of repeat customers. I also heard a rumor that the landlord is supposed to update the community eating tables soon.

Come on by and check them out. I'll be back again soon and will take more photos of the food. It is always easier to point at a photo or give them a number than trying to read a foreign language. ENJOY!

{"text":"Transported to food courts in Singapore. When I walked into Mekong Plaza, the shops and food aromas of Asia flooded in. I was strangely at home. I was craving Taiwanese beef noodle. Thanks to Genie Yelper Karen W., she granted my first wish this Spring Break. Heng's Kitchen joins other indoor food court stalls in Mekong Plaza. I perused through the menu and decided quickly on #38 Spicy Beef Noodles. Alert: This soup packs a punch. The broth goes down easy but the heat comes on like a flash from the back. The tendon and round cuts of meat were tender and flavorful. The soup was fairly robust. It was packed full of spinach and other vegetables, but my favorite topping was the pickled greens. Was it the best I've had, the soup could have been a little more well developed, but it certainly hit the spot and satiated my craving. 

Karen had the Szechuan fish with rice. I enjoyed it. It was nice to see HK deliver different flavors and textures in their dishes. 

Price tag: A large portion of noodles for slightly under $8. I even brought home some of the broth that I could not finish. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea what I just ate but it was off the chain. Huge bowl of broth, noodles, with a brisket-like meat. My meal was so good. A little on the spicy. I might have ordered a spicy dish (don't really know). 5/5 stars for the mystery bowl at Hengs Kitchen"}
{"text":"????? ??????? ??????? ???????????????? 

\"stewed spicy chicken, Sweet&sour pork ribs and meek skin with\" is my favorite. And soy milk is traditional Chinese flavor. Delicious food with good price."}
{"text":"Quick and fast Chinese food.  The food court is nothing glorious but you come to get your Chinese food craving satisfied when your short on time."}
{"text":"Easy to access and seating in food court. Heng's Kitchen was friendly and helpful. The menu was easy to read. Very authentic Chinese food. The wok fried eggplant was most delicious. One of my new favorites. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough!  Wow!!  A small little food court stand at the end of the row. Forget all the other choices. This is the place!  Finally after 4 years living here in Phoenix, we have found our go to Chinese food place. The food is delicious and savory. Made fresh when ordered. The beef fried rice, fried egg and shrimp, the beef with scallions and the combo fries rice are all excellent!!  Oh and I can't forget the dumplings, amazing!!  We will be back at least once a month."}
{"text":"A friend and I are regulars at Mehong Palace! We love Thai Spices and the big restaurant in the middle of the mall. Today we decided to try one of the smaller joints. We hit up Heng's. I am assume the owner was running the place and he was super nice! The presentation was great, but the food wasn't up to par with the other options in the complex. The beef strips where a little bland, the spicy pot stickers were the best part, but a bit oily and to much cilantro. We also tried the spicy chicken chow mein; meh...a bit dry and bland again. I wouldn't say \"don't go there\" but I would say, there are people eating much better dishes within eye shot."}
{"text":"i had dumplings and they were excellent, but the dipping sauce was very plain and vinegary. the service was ok, but might be better if i spoke Chinese."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner at this place.  We order soup, fish, dan dan noodle, pancake.  Since we went there around 7 pm.  They ran out some pickle veggie and others ingredients for my noodle, they decided to add any things they can find in the kitchen sink in to the noodle bowl.  My bowl of noodle tasted like just salt and noodle. What they should do was tell the customer they ran out of that dish instead they grep some random ingredients and served to the customer.
  The taste were very bad.    Will not go back in the future."}
{"text":"This one is a little tricky.  We received a recommendation for it, and the reviews seemed to be OK, so here we are.  I saw \"kung pao chicken\".  I know that!  It's a good metric to judge them, right?  Well, the owner (I assume) indicated this was \"Shanghai style\".  Not spicy.  Kung pao that isn't spicy??  Isn't that like water that isn't wet??

Well, I ordered it anyway.  My wife ordered the beef noodle soup.

The kung pao was not what I would call \"kung pao\".  Sprinkling peanuts on it doesn't change that.  However, if I put \"kung pao\" out of my mind and just ate it, it was tasty.  A hint of sourness, but just a hint.  Not spicy at all.  But a nice flavor.

My wife liked her soup.  I didn't.  It clearly used whatever seasoning appears in every Vietnamese dish I've ever had, and I don't like that flavor.  It's why I don't eat Vietnamese.  No idea what it is, but it's in everything-Vietnamese and in this beef noodle soup.  But, as my wife liked it, I'll have to score that as a positive for them.

The two of us ate for a bit over $16.  We both walked away full, and had some soup leftover.  All-in-all, \"A-OK\".  Not wonderful or spectacular, but pretty good."}
{"text":"I just ordered #67 Pork & picked cabbage fried rice cake.  You have the option of the rice cake or the rice cake soup version.  This was the most delicious Asian dish I ever ordered.  Wow!  I don't remember any Asian dishes hitting my taste buds like that for 20 years."}
{"text":"This is the real deal for a Shanghai style noodle place: potstickers and soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, beef noodle soup, new year's cake and lots more.  Everything I have had has been great."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the Shaanxi \"cold skin\" noodles (it's called Meek Skin on the menu) but they were out, so I asked the sweet lady for recommendations and she suggested fried rice cake with pork and pickled cabbage. It was good but the rice cake was packaged. I had to wait for a long time since I was there at 4:30pm which was an odd hour, but I had time to kill so it wasn't an issue.
While waiting, I examined the menu and they had food from all regions of China. It's good because there are choices, but bad because when you try to please everyone, you please no one. There's a daily special menu written in Chinese and it had noodles and lamb dishes. I believe the chefs/owners are from northern China so I'd stick with those. Don't read Chinese? No worries. Anything you get here is much better and more authentic than your typical Moo Shu places."}
{"text":"After reading a glowing newspaper review of this place, thought we'd stop by.  I love soup dumplings and Heng's was serving them.  Got there at around 5:30 pm on a Friday night and the Mekong Plaza food court was empty, minus a few employees.  Found Heng's in the back corner and ordered our food.  
The scallion pancake tasted deep fried, and was greasy, bland, and flavorless.  I could smell scallions, but didn't taste any.  The soup dumplings were also flavorless and disappointing.  A little salt in the broth would have helped big time.  We also ordered beef with broccoli and pork with pickled cabbage & rice cakes.  Both were nice looking dishes, but missing any flavor.  Adding soy sauce helped a bit.  If you're searching, this isn't the place for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Too slow, waited 40min to get my dish. Too salty. It is weild yelp wont let me post review if i give only 1 star."}
{"text":"Ideally I would give 4.5 stars, mainly because it's a food court with little to no AC on 110 degree day it's a bit uncomfortable. The scallion pancake was the best I have come across, bar none, if you like crispy scallion pancakes. The mapo was a bit on the mild side, which is fine it had great nuances of schezuan peppercorns and just the right amount of pork. I am a big white guy so I am used to having ask for things to be authentically spiced and almost always have to ask for chop sticks, same holds true here."}
{"text":"I always love eating at this place. The food is delicious and the prices are good. I love the spicy lamb noodle soup and the dan dan noodles. I haven't tried anything I didn't like. I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Amazing little place.  They have great shrimp and eggs.  The woman at the counter was quiet but sweet.  Very clean kitchen, too!  I will be getting the frozen take out dumplings to make at home!"}
{"text":"Glad I tried it.  The photos on yelp don't really represent well.  The food was a little greasy and the homemade dumpling fillings didn't seem homemade.  Better dumplings elsewhere and better black bean noodles elsewhere."}
{"text":"Heng's Kitchen has authentic Northern Chinese cuisine. We love the spicy beef noodle soup and dumplings. The shepherds purse won tons are fabulous too. Clean kitchen and excellent service!"}
{"text":"This place is so great! The Spicy Chicken is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Flavor is good! But each dish doesn't have much for the price. Such as spicy oil fish probably had 6 fish slices. Chicken dish had 5 pieces of chicken. Not like some other Same price Chinese restaurants, we always have some left over. But taste good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! 
Honestly, we didn't expect they have such good authentic Chinese foods. Me and my Chinese friend ordered Dan Dan Noodle and steamed chicken, and both were fantastic. 
Dan Dan noodle was the best I've ever had in the states. 
Chicken was also very tender and juicy, and portion was big enough. 
I will visit this place again!!"}
{"text":"?? ?????? ?????? ?????? ????Nice place to try traditional cuisine in Jiangsu Province."}
{"text":"I am givimg this place a 50/50 rating. I highly recommend you to dine in and not take out. The dine in food tastes so much better and delicious!!!!  Ordered the spicy wontons :) in addition, do not come when it is busy. The food quality is better when they are not busy."}
{"text":"Come here for the dumplings!  Other dishes I've had were delicious as well, but seriously, the dumplings.  They have great steamed and fried pork dumplings with a few variations on fillings, and they sell them frozen in packs of 25 for 12$, which I now buy frequently.  I've tried about half of the chicken dishes here and they're all good."}
{"text":"We were craving dumplings and this placed popped up when we searched. I'm so glad we did! We ordered the spicy beef noodle, the pork and shepherds purse wonton, and an order of homemade juicy steamed pork mini dumplings. Everything was so good! I have to say though our favorite dish was the mini dumplings! If anything order them!"}
{"text":"Our first visit together at the food court in Mekong Plaza at lunchtime resulted in both my girlfriend instinctively heading towards this restaurant.
Just moments after the food arrived at our table we discovered that our instinct was spot on.
We shared an order of Braised Pig Trotter.
The portion size was plenty for the two of us.

Our initial and immediate impression was that we both agreed this dish was perfectly prepared.
My girlfriend, who is a native of mainland China, also vouched for the its authenticity, which is impressive for a restaurant located in a shopping mall.
The skin was very tender and cooked evenly all the way through yet still had the right degree of chewiness, which for me is the best indication of skillful preparation.
The meat was succulent and the fat and tendon successfully delivered the sticky and gelatinous yumminess for which this dish is so well known.
The broth was savory and nicely seasoned but not overpowering.
My girlfriend said it was \"pigilicious\"
Fans of this dish should definitely try it here :-)

On our second visit we shared a bowl of spicy beef stew noodle soup (#38).
The portion size was plenty for the two of us.
The broth was yummy with just the right amount of spice, the noodles were the right degree of chewiness, and the beef was tender and flavorful. 
If your a fan of beef noodle soup then we definitely recommend trying it here :-)

Prompt, courteous service, reasonable prices, a great place for some authentic Chinese cuisine for lunch or dinner.

{"text":"Heng's Kitchen
66 S. Dobson Road
Mesa 85202

Heng's Kitchen is one of a number of small shops located in the food court of the Mekong Plaza Mall.
Seating is at a series of tables and would be generously called open seating at four tops. However, the star of the show is not the ambiance, since there is none, but rather the wonderful food.

Many of the foods that they serve I have not eaten since being in China, especially the soup dumplings which are a specialty of Shanghai.

For those not familiar, soup dumplings are essentially a small meatball, surrounded by soup, and wrapped in a wonton type wrapper. The secret to them is that they must be made when ordered - no pre made food here. They are listed on the menu as Home Made Juicy Steamed Pork Mini Dumplings. 

I immediately ordered 2 orders of them for myself and companion, and was almost in tears remembering my days in Shanghai as I devoured them. Unfortunately, I did not account for how filling they were and needed a doggy  bag to bring the rest of the meal home. 

Notables on the menu are drunken chicken, spicy wontons, pork slices and pickled cabbage w/noodles. 

For the more adventurous, try the streaky pork with the home made sauce, or the Chinesse barbecue pork (spicy). The hot and spicy boiled beef or fish is a real treat for those who like it hot, and their Mapo Tofu is a real treat. 

For those who prefer not to eat meat, there are a number of vegetarian dishes on the menu as well.

With the exception of a very few specialty items that are priced near the $13 mark, most items on the menu are between six and eight dollars.

They take all credit cards and are open till 9 at night.

I give them 3 stars for great food."}
{"text":"I love the selection of Chinese food here. It's a mix of different regions, from Shanghai style dumplings to Sichuan water boiled fish. I got an order of xiao long bao to go ($6.25, labeled as \"Home-made juicy steamed pork mini dumplings\"). There were 6 dumplings per order, and while most of them had the lovely savory broth that is indicative of these type of dumplings, 2 of them were dry (Although the meat inside was still tender and juicy). The dumplings were flavorful and tasted fresh. They get bonus points for including a prepackaged plastic spork in my to-go bag (Sporks are cool) :). 

This is a small mom and pop run operation, and the lady co-owner speaks both Mandarin and English. 

I'll definitely stop by here again if I'm in the area to try more inexpensive and tasty Chinese food options."}
{"text":"Nothing special, Homemade fried pork dumplings are definitely not homemade.  Pork fried rice is almost edible, twice fried pork is not.  The black pepper beef was the only thing that was decent but salty.  Not going  back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place in Phoenix for a real Beef Noodle Soup.  It is a little salty for my taste but that is how they make it in Beijing.  Since the owner knows that I really appreciate good cuisine from him, he will personally make alteration to fit my taste.  His other dishes are also very high in quality which is a must in an Asian Food Court since our expectations are so high.  If you want a REAL DEAL..Here is IT..The prices are very reasonable and the dumplings are as good as it gets.  It is a family run place the the little girl does give out the wrong change (She gave me too much money)  so you got to watch out and make sure her mother runs the register."}
{"text":"I'm a huge, huge fan of Asian food courts. Living in the West Valley, there are hardly any so I have to make the trek out here for that. Anyway, the food here is pretty damn good and authentic. This is the not the kind of place you come to order Americanized fare like General Tso's or sweet and sour chicken. You can go to PF Chang's or Panda Express for that.

We had the streaky pork with homemade sauce. Pork belly meat was cooked perfectly and tender. It went really well with the included bowl of rice. Only complaints were that they used a little too much corn starch in their sauce (it became gelatinous) and they didn't include a side of veggies like they did in another picture of the same dish. Perhaps things just need to be a little more consistent. However, this is still decent and I would come again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"As many may have noticed, it used to be kongfu kyoza, but not any more...
True, they are keeping many old items, and have added a lot new dishes that may feature shanghai flavor - that' what I learned from other reviews. I ordered Liangpi, which used to be my favorite at Kongfu Gyoza, I lived in Xi'an for 4 years and am crazy about Liangpi. I know different provinces may have different ways to make Liangpi and I am always open to try new things, BUT! Their Liangpi is among the fewer that I couldn't stand, it is indeed one of the worst Liangpi that I have ever eaten, salty is the only taste.... I wanted to give one star review but I didn't try anything else so I don't want to be misleading. Only one suggestion, do not try the Liangpi, and from that perspective, I won't encourage anyone to try their noodles, disappointment guaranteed:(
??????????"}
{"text":"First time dining tonight, very good. The beef and broccoli was tasty and not overdone. The lamb soup and fried won tons also very good. Prompt service, food served hot. Will go back ."}
{"text":"Good Chinese is hard to find in the valley of the sun. This little courtyard gem delivers. I had noodles with vegetables and it was really satisfying. My plate was made to order. It was worth the wait."}
