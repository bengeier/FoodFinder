{"text":"Went to Mavi Grill with the family (party of 8). We ordered the Mix Grill Platter, Iskander Kabab (veal/chicken mix), and Doner Kabab. It came with a large tray of sumptuous  salad. The food was great with loads of extras on the side --- their white and hot sauce is a great condiment to enjoy with the meals!

We finished up with hot Turkish coffee and baklava!

Special mention for the owners --- they are very hospitable!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant but not great. The food was served buffet style in chafing dishes. The environment is nice but the food is nothing out of the ordinary. Sort of boring."}
{"text":"Absolutely Garbage! I don't usually write reviews for restaurants, but this one was an exception. The first time I visited this restaurant, it was closed despite what the hours of operation stated. Nevertheless, we decided to give this restaurant a try. This was the worst experience I have ever had, for the following reasons:

1. The food took ridiculously long to arrive (45 minutes in our case). The given reason was they were short staffed. The staff level was 4 employees, with a total of 12 people in the dining room.
2. The restaurant reeked of sweat.
3. When you ask for water, you are given bottled water for a charge with no warning.
4. The music volume fluctuated multiple times throughout our evening making it very difficult to carry a conversation. 
5. Our initial orders were changed multiple times due to short supply. This is ridiculous as we were there at exactly 6pm on a Sunday.

Last, but not least.

6. Food quality was average at best. The bread was very dry, and the entire platter was unfulfilling. 

This is a restaurant that I will never visit again."}
