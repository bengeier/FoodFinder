{"text":"Very delicious!

Wife had apple and Brie burger, I had the big kahuna, both were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Decent food but portions for a lot of the better options are a tad too small. Good burger though. Experienced slow service during six of my seven visits with the family."}
{"text":"Easy goto spot with friends or family.  The menu is very diverse with some interesting picks.  The wait staff are friendly and attentive. 

The only annoyance is the screaming kids.  I've been here 3 times during lunch hour and there have been screaming kids every time.  The wait staff ignore it, and mgmt don't seem to acknowledge that it ruins the experience of others.

Very nice decor since it's Reno a few months ago but still same old low end feel when it comes to some of the other customers.  Like going to boston pizza but with better stuff on the walls. 

Should be the place you go to when you don't want to think about where to go to."}
{"text":"Honestly.....Turtle Jack's isn't that great. You'd think a supply chain would be good at least. NOPE. Not planning on returning. I ordered a chicken dish that was SWEET when the waiter told me it would be spicy! I was not pleased. Pretty bland food. Courtney park should put a better resto here to be frank. And way too expensive for the quality of food."}
{"text":"A group of us went mid week for a late dinner. It wasn't very busy and service was mediocre.  Food was as expected for chain restaurant. Tried something new..deep fried pickles! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dessert,  other restaurants lines where too long. I was surprised by how big the portions where. Easily shared by two. Nice staff,  clean,  good looking restaurant. Recommended the desserts"}
{"text":"What a disaster.  Slow service.  4 of 6 meals wrong.  Management does not care.  Inconsistent flavours of wings."}
{"text":"Out for a bite with a friend and decided to try the resto despite the odd moniker (tortoise flapjacks/mystery nuggets?). Came for the Muskoka grill and a rustic vibe, but left feeling cold.


ATMOSPHERE
 

Like an upscale Kelsey's or Jack Astors, the palce has oodles of room. Bar area with high tables, high booths; seating area with lots of booths. DÃ©cor includes fireplaces random bits of fake birch logs, check check, shiny rustic look, check. Good for groups to watch the game, dinner with family, even good for a date.
 

FOOD

As per the usual for a resto like this, vaguely Italian with fried food, some tacos and random 'exotic' influences like butter chicken and bison meatloaf. Being a health nerd and it being late, I went for a salad. I will say now, there is little I hate worse than a lazy salad at a restaurant. Iceberg lettuce with 1/6th of a green bell pepper and a flake or two of nut and cheese? Salad purgatory, table for one, please.

 I ordered the field greens. Not eighth level of hell bad, but it wasn't good. Iceberg or romaine? Couldn't tell. Didn't care. Boring in taste and appearance, despite toppings of beets, sunflower seeds, shredded carrots and cherry tomatoes. Chincy portions on the topping as well. Not worth my $8.99.

 
SERVICE

 This was where the experience really fell flat for us. My friend's salad (looking equally lackluster) came with a sad piece of salmon on top, which upon an adventurous slice, was very undercooked. Nearly raw. Our server, having been flagged down (after trying insincerely to upsell my order with drinks), apologized then said ' oh we'll just throw it back on the grill for you'. Um, ok. Then she comes back with a small plate, asks my friend to help her put just the salmon on it, which she does, then she takes it away. Ten minutes later she returns with the sad piece of salmon, which is now cooked. At the end, we waited for 20 minutes trying to find her so we could leave, then when she reappeared she messed up my friend's bill. Extremely disappointing with no effort to make amends.


LOCATION

Close to the 404 exit on 16th between Woodbine and Leslie, it is a thick nest of traffic lights away from my east Markham home, but an easy ride up the highway from the city core. Not visible easily from 16th , look for the Fraticelli sign instead.


OVERALL

Not going back, unless it's a group thing someone else is organizing!"}
{"text":"Not so busy for a big restaurant,but good service.  The food took a little to long, but it was good. I tried the salmon and it was just perfect with salad.  And my friend had chicken wings and it was better then other wing places near this area."}
{"text":"Me and the family went for dinner on a Saturday night. The service was typical for this kind of eatery. We all had hamburgers which were good but if you want your burger well done make  sure to ask for it that way, as my wife's came  medium well. All in all not a bad place for the buck."}
{"text":"Manaager rude AF and food was awful. The only good thing is the candy they give you with the bill."}
{"text":"Alway reliably good quality food and service. TJ's is one of our consistent \"go to's\"."}
{"text":"The family and I stopped by Turtle Jacks this week. It was Thursday at lunch and just under half full. The service was great, our waitress was very friendly and helpful with menu suggestions. We had the 3 cheese dip as a starter which was pretty delicious. Between the four of us we had the chicken fajitas, burgers and buffalo chicken wrap. Everyone was happy with their meals. Prices were fair. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Took my wife for a valentine day dinner.
We were rushed, ordered the steak and my wife ordered ribs. Food arrived in 5 minutes and it was cold. Steak was cold and had no flavor. You are better off going to moxie grill or the keg.
Will never go back"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this restaurant. Interior design is smart and elegant. We were greeted as soon as we step foot inside and were taken to our table. Our waitress was very attentive, enthusiastic and professional. We had the fresh quac and salsa with nachos to start and a classic burger, haddock and cold and tomato soup and ceased salad as mains. Portions are generous. Probably would order two dishes next time for us three. I'd say they are somewhere between Montana's and Jack Astor. Would be back, I'll try some desserts this time."}
{"text":"This was the worse meal I had in very long time. I had the bison meatloaf that came with a very dark black gravy that I shouldn't have eaten. in addition to being tasteless, the gravy turned my toungue black and gave me acid indigestion, a rarity for me. My wife had the french dip sandwich that was not only terrible, it made her sick. The nachos were terrible. Very difficult to find any of the chicken that we paid to be added to the nachos. The kids did like their hamburger and chicken fingers, but for 120 plus dollares and negative side effects, this was the worst restaurant in recent memory. I actually activated my yelp account just so I could write this review. Steer clear. I wish it were possible to give no stars."}
{"text":"The place is really nice and service is okay. I have ordered wings which turned out okay however their buffalo chicken wrap is delicious. It is a great environment for a group of friends to watch sports and hang out."}
{"text":"Amazing experience here tonight. The food was fantastic and the service was the best I have ever gotten anywhere. Not only was our waitress (Allah) attentive and kind but also gave honest and spot on recommendations. She went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with everything and make the evening a great experience. Everything arrived to our table quickly and was cooked to perfection. Would 100% recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"very slow service for a friday night. Just expect to wait awhile before you get your meal or drinks."}
{"text":"I went to Turtle Jacks for the first time yesterday. It was my brother's birthday and our family had Groupon vouchers. Although I didn't know anyone who had tried this restaurant before, he said that a friend really liked the food. 
Walking in, I thought the decor and design was nice enough, standard sort of casual fine dining with sports channels on all the TVs and a wine cellar with glass doors. Sort of an upscale cabin interior. 
Anyway, the menu had a good selection of bar food, steakhouse, and gourmet sandwiches, etc. I ordered the fish tacos (they were out of my first choice, the bison meatloaf), my mom had the pot roast grilled cheese, my dad got the chipotle steak, and my brothers ordered the steak fajitas and a burger. Our sides included lobster mashed potatoes (which sounded really good), french onion soup, fries, and salad.
We had arrived at 7:30 and ordered a bit slowly. The server was very nice and when she didn't know the answer to how much an certain off-menu side would cost, she would go check for us immediately. 
After we ordered, we waited impatiently for our food as the different smells of food wafted out of the kitchen. At one point, I checked the time and realized that it was 8:30. We probably waited at least 45 minutes for our food to arrive. It wasn't a busy night either. There were probably about 5 or 6 other tables that were occupied in the large restaurant. 
When the food finally arrived, I was pleased with the portion sizes of everything. Everything was large, especially the grilled cheese and burger, except the steak, which looked quite tiny, but was very thick and filling. The grilled cheese was delicious, with tender pieces of meat and buttered and toasted bread.The tacos were juicy. The steak was mediocre, as was the burger. The fajitas were pretty good. As for the sides, the fries were amazing, thick and nicely crispy. The lobster mashed potatoes were also pretty great, with a couple large chunks of meat buried in the hot-sauce drizzled mound. The french onion soup was very filling, more edible than drinkable, really. The salad had nice pieces of bacon sprinkled on top. All in all, the food was worth the wait.
At the end, we were quite full but my brother got a free birthday brownie out of the evening. A warm Skor brownie with fudge, ice cream and whipped cream on top. Everyone had a bite and it was absolutely delicious.
I would recommend this place again but skip the steak which takes too long to cook. They have a good variety and the food is great and well-presented. The wait staff is friendly and the price point is average."}
{"text":"Hit and miss with TJ's. We live close by so it's convenient. Love the food here!  Wings, nachos, burgers are all really good!  NY butter wings are to die for (no pun intended...ha!). There's also a great patio for summertime drinks and dinner!  Only thing I wish TJ's would improve is to review their service consistency...that's why it's a hit/ miss."}
{"text":"well....I came here for dinner last week and I regretted for not consulting Yelp before, mainly because I have heard of this restaurant a few years back .... and this is what happened..

They were known for their ribs, but we came at around 9pm and they were sold out on ribs (first disappointment). Fine. switched to steak. The steak for over cooked and small...and it cost $26, but could have gotten a better quality at Moxie, MIlestone or Canyon Creek. I ordered the Waldorf salad....when the server brought it up, it shocked me, because they used grapes to decorate the plate...those grapes were not too fresh (perfect example of \"less is more\") They mixed blue cheese, celery, cranberry and walnut in the salad.... cranberry and walnut were fine...celery were a bit weird..I think it because they didn't have enough apple. On top of the salad, they put a piece of naan looking flat bread, but it's super crunchy like biscuit, but the thickness of a naan. I cannot believe that cost me $13. There is no protein on this salad by the way. My friend ordered a flatbread something...and another surprise, it was a piece of veggie burger wrapped with pita outside. It's worse than something I'd prepare for myself at home.

It took almost 25 - 30 minutes for our food to arrive, and given that it was past 9pm by the time we placed our order and the restaurant was not busy at all, most people are paying for their bill already. Other than that, our server was nice. They have TVs all over the restaurant, I guess it would still be a good place for games night, just don't expect to come for food."}
{"text":"This is around the corner from me and I've been here since they opened.  I come maybe 4 times a year.   Food has not changed much.   Burgers still a bit salty and they need to change their oil more often as the fries had that \"Oil needs to be changed\" taste.  It's a step above McDonalds just like the Keg, Jack Astors etc..

Staff are fine and doing their jobs.  Last visit, daughter had the Nachos and unfortunately they were somewhat cold when served, I'm talking about the cheese being cold and solidified which made it difficult to pull the nachos apart without ripping it into clumps.  Pricey but close to my house."}
{"text":"This review was based on a recent weeknight visit.  My family and I went to this restaurant hoping to enjoy a nice family meal together since we have heard good things about the Turtle Jack franchise.  We were wrong! My boys (under 5) each ordered a turtle shell pasta kids meal, for $5.99 you would think it includes a decent amount of pasta (they cost nothing).  Nooo..it came in on a small soup dish with just 1/2 cup of white pasta, no garnish nothing, and my boys were so hungry we have to order another kids meal!  Mind you my boys were under 5 and they are NOT big eaters at all.  Very disappointed that we have to pay for 3 kids meals for that kind of food.

My husband and I ordered something from the regular menu, which were okay but not great.  He ordered a beer and everyone else ordered plain water. The bill with tips came to $75!!!!! How is this worth $75 of food and service? Server was nice but she didn't address the small meal and said most kids ordered two. Really? 

We should have gone to Swiss Chalet next door.  Never coming back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Turtle Jack's 2.0 is the caption for this restaurant. Redesigned, refurbished, and repackaged are the words to describe this place, from the tragedy it once was. Newly designed contemporary modern day dining room experience from the lumber jack \"timbucktoo\" look, redesigned menu with simplicity and delicious food. I ordered the \"Big wing sandwich\" with the blue cheese crumble and it was right on. Definitely a place to visit."}
{"text":"OMG fish and chips are amazing here one of my fav places to eat out at
Presentation also every time is great and definitely makes the meal more appetizing"}
{"text":"The service was okay, and the menu options were okay. However the food was mediocre and it took a long time to come. 

I did like the cotage-y feel of the place."}
{"text":"The waitress forgot our drinks for the whole meal. The burger was charred leather, probably from sitting on the grill all day. The ribs were passable but generic.

Over all this is a very mediocre low-end restaurant... And it's not cheap."}
{"text":"I come here often with my family and we love the food here! So being the very white-washed Asians we are, we came here for mother's day and we weren't disappointed. The food was good, the menu is basically like any other chain resto but my family likes the nachos here the best. Also there use to be a bacon fat vinaigrette dressing they made which sounds gross but was amazing, sadly it's off their menu now. 

Service was great, we called in 3 hours prior to make reservations and there was no problems. Our waitress was very nice, came to check up on us a good amount of times, made conversation effortlessly, and refilled our drinks when they were still 1/3 full. 

To top it all off, there was a complimentary brownie with strawberries and ice cream for the mommas in the house. AND they have a points reward system, how could I not like this place?"}
{"text":"Expensive for what u get onyour plate. Ordered calamari, blackened bass, burger and brocolli cheddar soup. And will not go back. The food doesn't stand out from average. Calamari was chewy. Fish did not have flavoud u cud taste the raw spice. Save your cash for fast food u will be more satisfied.The service was great though and our server was v nice. The only reason I went to this place was because the previous reviews were good but unfortunatly I was dissappointed and had a big bill to boot."}
{"text":"I guess this is typical for a chain restaurant in Canada. 

Pricing way too high for their so called 28 day aged steaks. The price and quality were not close to what I usually pay at higher end restaurants. 

Service was okay, not great!

The place was clean. 

Will not repeat, not worth the money for the food."}
{"text":"Love this place! I am never disapponted when I go here. The food is great the service is good. It is a smidge expensive but it is worth it. Tip, try their wings roasted dusted they r to die for."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch this Saturday and had the fish tacos - O...M.....G they were AMAZING. The atmosphere here is great - it's got a high end bar feel with great prices and drink specials. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Menu looked interesting, server was nice, but the chewiest steak fajita I have ever had, I could not do it too much effort. Glad I didn't get a steak. They no charged the bill, thank God."}
{"text":"This place tries to be Earls, and doesn't pull it off. Great waiter. Below average food, that is high priced."}
{"text":"i am giving this place a lower start rating because of my last visit.  they no longer have a lunch menu.  the value is was not good in the first place but now with the new menu prices have gone up.  the gross thing was the dust on the tv on top of our table.  pretty much over my food.  they need to be cleaner."}
{"text":"Had luch here with the family yesterday the 26/2 we normaly go to Montana's but decided to try something new. Had never been before the service was fine but the food was lacking both my husband and i had the noodle bowl (huge portions) but there was not enough sauce it was a bit bland with the teryaki sauce my husband took the sweet and spicy and it was just ok.
The atmospher was ok but i don't know if we will be going back"}
{"text":"I work near this bar & grill place. I usually catch sports games on work breaks here or go out with coworkers after work for drinks and appetizers.

The place is very clean and very tastefully decorated, like all Turtle Jack locations that I have been to. The menu is what you would expect from a good establishment of this kind. It also has a few more exotic dishes, if you like that. I have eaten various dishes off the menu, all very tasty.

I recommend you try the Skor Brownie Obsession for dessert. It's just fantastic.

The staff is always friendly. Service may be a bit slow at busy times, but always attentive."}
{"text":"The service was good here, our waitress was very helpful. However our food left a lot to want. The 21$ nachos (18ish in USD) were not worth it at all. The chicken garlic rolls were too cheesy and hardly any chicken. If we wanted some egg rolls, we would have went to Empire Wok. Avoid this place at all costs, your taste buds and wallet will appreciate it."}
{"text":"Get the chicken fingers, they are bomb toss em in sweet thai chillie  sauce and thank me later"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and hated it both times! Will not be coming back unless I have no choice if its for someone's bday or something. The dishes I tried were not that good. Service was not good either. Service was slow in more ways then one! I'm not one to go on about poor service in a review but when it's really bad and multiple times, I feel like I should say something. I went once with my family and once with a big group of friends....I mean how can you miss us?!  Slowwww service! One of my friends asked for a Caesar and the waitress brought back a Caesar salad but it was the drink she wanted lol. We all had our main meal already in front of us and were almost done. She would have ordered it at beginning as an app if that's what she wanted and would have said \"caesar salad.\" My drink wasn't made good (rye & 7) and i love that drink but couldn't enjoy it! When I went with my family, I had a pop. The waitress brought out another one. When I told her \"oh I didn't ask for another one,\"  she replied, \"but that's what we do.\" I told her not only did I not ask for another one but my drink I already have is still full! Best part was my parents whose pops were almost done, she never brought them another one, just me....lol! She didn't seem to understand. My dad ordered baked potato with his wings (that's what he wanted). Wings were good he said, but baked potato was cold so butter was not going to melt on. She never came by to see how our meal was. Now for the biggie!...Also while with my family, a person (male) who worked there, (think he was a manager) cause he was going up to different tables, all but ours! (you tend to have a lot to look at, cause  you have time on your hands waiting for food, due to slow service.) Happened to notice that he was going up to tables where ppl were of Indian/Pakistan descent, like himself. Not once did he come up to our table! Not impressed!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat-fish tacos were delicious and beautiful presentation. The fish and chips were very good-we split that 2 piece between 2piece and it was still too much! The coleslaw was delicious and none of us were big coleslaw lovers! The fries were a bit too greasy but if they wouldn't serve the fish on top, that would probably help. Service was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing service.  Food was good but expensive.  They had to reimburse us for the meal because manager felt so bad."}
{"text":"Terrible mgmnt. Juvenile attitude.  Wake up high school graduates turned bartenders and hostesses. Learn that disposition is everything"}
{"text":"I have tried this place several times and it seems to be going downhill. Had the burger on several occasions... quite good, but very expensive. Partner had chicken fingers...small. shriveled up and overdone. Also way overpriced. The last (and final) time we went back we had French onion soup and bruschetta. The soup was served in small glasses(no joke) for $8.99 each!  The bruschetta was literally some tomatoes on a small baguette... for $9.99. No wonder this place is not busy. A rip-off!!!!"}
{"text":"I have love hate relationship with this place.

Boyfriend and I went here twice and swore we'd never go back. The service was horrible - slow, didn't refill my water (very important to me) or any other drinks, took forever just to get their attention. The food...too dry, too salty, cold. My pasta was swimming in oil not once but twice. It was just horrible.

After a few months, we had no idea what to eat...maybe turtle club (as I so dearly call it)? So we went, and it wasn't gross or slow.

Especially since I've changed my order. 

I now order the four cheese chicken penne without the chicken. Instead I substitute it with the blackened basa fillet. It is so, so good. So good.

Since I've changed my order, they haven't charged me extra for the substitution (which I'm glad. I'd raise a ruckus if they start charging me), and I enjoy my experience there so much more.

Go try it (if you're not in a rush)!"}
{"text":"The food was good, small portions but it was tasty... Drink wise ok selection but not properly made... The service was not good. I tipped the server 10% and that's because I felt bitchy doing anything else.. I would've left nothing but I felt bad, I work as a server and I know that we need the tips.. Anyways. When we got there my friend asked for a table for 6 and she said anywhere you like.. All the tables only had for 4 people so we had to put tables together so we could all fit... We asked for menus and we only got one for 4 people. We then had to get up and approach her at the bar to ask for more and only got a second one... Before even sitting she asked to take a drink order. I have never been there before so I didn't know what to order.. She didn't seem to care until we asked for more time... One thing that really bugged us is that there was a bottle and a cloth used to clean tables on our table and she didn't bother to take it off until my friend asked to please remove it... She didn't apologize she just said okay sure no problem. Like if it was something we had done... We wanted to leave 5 minutes after we arrived but decided to stay since it was late and it was the only food place available at the time... I don't know if I'll ever come back on a slow or busy night. Since our server wasn't able to take care of us only having 10 ppl in the restaurant..."}
{"text":"Went for dinner/drinks. Got serious eye candy and decent food/service. Our waitress, Meghan, was fantastic. Super friendly, attentive, and knew the menu.
Had a Classic Burger (it was so-so) and salad, which weren't anything to get excited about, but she made up for the lacklustre meal. Friend had a steak, which was apparently great. The ambiance is excellent for happy hour...or someone wanting a nice meal and staff who are easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"Ever watched Kitchen Nightmare by Gordon Ramsay? I felt like I was Gordon tasting a horribly cooked food, except that I'm neither a chef nor restaurateur. The Chicken Parmesan was the worst Chicken Parmesan that I've had.

Bland,l and funky bitterly taste on the chicken. The only redeeming part is the toasted bun that came with it. I'm not an expert to confirm with absolute certainty that the chicken isn't fresh, although my stomach and taste bud are hinting that.

Service was ok, no complaints on the service."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner on a Sunday night and was not impressed.

The service was SO slow. We waited at the door for a minute or two before a hostess showed up to bring us to a table. Then it look 10 mins for the waitress to come take our order, and another 25 mins till the food came. It wasn't even that busy, there were only a couple of tables. 

The food was alright. Nothing to write home about. We ordered the fish tacos, the Bison meatloaf and chicken wings. The fish taco had way too much lettuce compared to the other ingredients. Bison meat loaf was ok. Wings were ok.

When we were ready to leave, of course it took like 10 mins for our waitress to come by for us to be able to ask for the bill.

Probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Found this turtle jacks tucked away from the main street, easy to miss.

Greeting/waiting staff were very friendly and attentive... Food arrived quickly and reasonably hot considered we were sitting in the patio area.

Portions were smaller than what I typically expect for the price, but quality and taste made up for it.  Enjoyed the meal.

Butter chicken was a tiny bit more tomato-y than I'm used to but very tasty.  Calamari was light in the batter, tasty and not oily - all around good meal.

Recommend this place - but not sure how service and quality are affected by busy times, we went lunch on a Saturday.

Give it a try."}
{"text":"A decent restaurant with good food. Very fitting for a simple grill as the menu isn't too broad. The service here is always great but sometimes it gets slow. I've been here many times and have never had any issues! There isn't really much else to say about this place. I would recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! If your looking for a quick lunch with a large variety then you picked the right place!"}
{"text":"Love the quality of service, food and atmosphere overall. Some useful items to choose from the menu for example are the Classic Buffalo chicken fingers with Jerk sauce which goes well with a pint of Heineken. 

Been to this location 4 times now and definitely worth getting the TLC Loyalty card if you're a regular visitor."}
{"text":"I come here every so often and I always leave happy :) 
I like the staff, they're friendly and attentive.
the dÃ©cor is alright with me, nothing fancy but nothing tacky.
I've actually never been to that bathrooms, I usually look out for that because they say you can tell how clean a place is based on the cleanliness of the bathroom lol
but from the eating area everything seems clean so that good to me

the food is great but I find it to be inconsistent at times... 
sometimes ill order the same thing and one day it will be delicious and other time it will taste different, I don't know why that is, I don't know if they have different cooks or whatever, but it makes me unsure of what to order.
the cocktails are nice very tasty, I love those
and the desserts are undeniable :) 

food = 4/5
service = 4.5/5
cleanliness 5/5"}
{"text":"From salad to hot app to entre nothing was done right.

Salad is soft and sad, salty, really don't understand how they managed to make salad salty.

We had cheese dip and wings as hot app. Cheese dip has no cheese... more like sour cream with salt. Lots of it, u can really taste the salt.

 Wings are tiny, fairly crispy and ain't too bad compare to other disasters.

We got steak. Overly done, dry, extremely salt, we ordered medium rear, it came chewy. 

Wine is fair, alcohol pour is short, beer is watery.

Save your money go somewhere else. Too bad ain't any option for negative star, giving this place a star is such a joke."}
{"text":"The food is good and fresh but very overpriced and the service is some of the worst I've ever experienced.  I used to be a semi-regular here but after my last experience there I doubt I will ever return.  The service is always slower than prostate cancer, even when the place is empty.  I made a reservation for my birthday and had them try to cancel on me when I had a dozen people showing up at 8.  They called and tried to move it back to 9 only a few hours beforehand and got rude with me when I refused.  By 10:30 they handed us our bills and kicked us out.  When I wrote into their head office to complain, I never received a response.  Highly unprofessional, and unacceptable.  They offer nothing that I couldn't get at Kelsey's or Montana's where I'd surely get better customer service."}
{"text":"Who is Jack and why does a turtle own a restaurant?  And I guess this turtle hails from Muskoka area...

It's what you expect for a chain restaurant.  Burgers are good, sandwiches are good salads are good but small for the price.  Overall, it's not a place you go to for fine dining, it's a casual place with casual plates.  I wouldn't be ordering salmon or steak here for fear they might mess it up...especially with the $30.00 + price tag on it.  And that's why I'm knocking off two stars because I do find the prices a bit high for what it is. 

And no, it doesn't feel like Muskoka in there, and no, I didn't see any turtles."}
{"text":"I think everyone that works there is still in high school but the food and service is good. Portion was maybe a little small but I was pretty full. The cheesy fries are so good and so bad for you I'm sure.

PS Needs some Keith's on tap or at least in bottles."}
{"text":"Ever since the changed their decor and menu, it hasn't been the same.  The fries are now thick cut so you only get a few in a small bowl and they are undercooked and soggy. The menu has very limited options now. I used to go to TJs a lot but there's nothing there now that I'd want to go back for."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food at this restaurant. I find the menu to be unique and definitely a step above other restaurants in the same category.  I have also visited the Port Carling location on many occasions and enjoy it as well.  For lunch it can be a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Brand spankin' new!  I believe it opened just days ago.  I have never been to a restaurant so new, so I went for the new experience.

I will say up front that I have never been to a Turtle Jack's before, so I cannot make any comparisons.  My friend lives very close to this location, so we stopped in for some martinis ($3.00 on Thursdays, what's up!).

So let's talk about the martinis.  I tried them all, and to their credit they were pretty tasty, but at the same time they were not your proper cocktail bar effort.  Having said that, they were made decently stiff and we stumbled out pretty happily.  How many did I have?  I think it was 6.  I think.

As far as the food goes, we just wanted some finger food to share, so we ordered \"bang bang shrimps\", which were basically shrimps fried, then covered in chicken wings sauce.  They were pretty meh.  Not enough spice to their signature NY Butter Wing sauce, in my opinion.

So I am told that because this is a new location, the decor is much better than that of other Turtle Jacks.  Again, I can't draw any comparisons, but I will say that to me it looks more like a cheaper version of Milestones.  Staff were friendly, but they were going through some new restaurant teething pain (not knowing what is available on the menu, not juggling tables properly, etc).

Honestly, I am not a fan of most Canadian chain restaurants.  This is one of those that I am not a fan of, and I don't see myself having a repeat visit (except for Thursdays, of course)."}
{"text":"Service = 3 star, a bit on the slow side
Food = 2.5-3 star, nothing too exciting, the fish that i ordered was a little dry
Price = 2 star
Decor = 3.5 star

Honestly speaking, I would expect a little better food at this price range.  Nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets a 'Meh. I've have experienced better\" rating because of the price.  It is definately not family friendly portions or prices.  Dinner felt more like lunch in terms of portion size.  I had an avocado turkey sandwich and it was not much different than what is offered at pickle barrel, but it cost about $3-$4 more.  In general I would say that is true of all their prices. Larger prices and smaller portions means I will not return here.  Decor is beautiful and it is nice for a date for young couples not concerned about price."}
{"text":"server decided to not come to us for 15 minutes because we r young and she probably didn't expect a tip although I start my at tip 18? all the time. 

we walked out and on our way out she sarcastically said \"you're not going to to eat here?\" with a laugh along with two of her co-workers who laughed as well. 

does it get any worse than laughing at guests who r walking our because they waited too long?

Horrble experience. I will never go to a turtle jacks or any of their sister franchises or anything related to this brand again."}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time, overall the service was pretty good but the food was really average, nothing really stood out that would have us coming back regularly."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch today on New Year's Day (yes, they were open). Great place! Solid 4-star restaurant. 

We started with the calamari, which tasted delicious. The breading was nice and crispy, and the inside was nicely cooked (not chewy).

I had wings with fries as my main. You have a choice of whether you want larger wings or smaller crispier wings. I went with the smaller wings. The wings were great! I tried their NY buttersauce as my wing sauce and it was really, really good.

Portions were not bad too. The price could have been a little cheaper ($16 for wings and fries), but no real complaints - the prices are fair.

Overall, great meal with good service for a decent price. Easily a 4-star place."}
{"text":"The most boring bar I been to in Mississauga plays to many country ass music on a Saturday night and too many kids at the bar area"}
{"text":"Our family got together for a nice dinner. Food took too long to arrive - not complaining as I was chatting with my family. Small portions - I have to say. If you order an appetizer you are safe, else you might end up having only half tummy full. Pasta was well prepared - well portioned on the sauce and meat.  The black cod tasted good and bad at the same time. Maybe the chef had to prepare it under 5 minutes. Overall I would suggest this place if you are close by and have never been there. I am not going there again at least for a year."}
{"text":"After months closed, they re-opened this restaurant. 

Food was ok. I had Dinner wings. They were kind of small for roasters. 
The 3 cheese dip was good. 

The beer could be colder."}
{"text":"Turtle Jacks is one of my favorite restaurants for Canadiana cuisine. I've been to Vaughan and Brampton locations however this Markham location takes the cake!!

Its interior is well appointed and upscale looking. Dark woods and frosted birch tree glass accents adorn the space. There's a good mix of seating from tables to booths. Its design is modern and the menu is extensive and creative I'd describe it as a mix of Keg/Kelsey/Jack Astors. 

Turtle Jacks menu offers the familiar with their twist on things; you got your ribs, wings, burgers, and sandwiches. 

We were there at lunch and ordered the grilled cheese pot roast sandwich w/coleslaw. And the wing sandwich with lobster mashed potatoes on the side. These were both delicious.

To cap the meal we ordered the fried cheese cake to share. Cheesecake has a light fried torte crust surrounding it. 

It was my first visit here but certainly not my last. 

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Their dusted or non dusted wings, roaster and fryer wing selection are great. 

Atmosphere and menu similar to Montana's. 

I prefer the food here if I feel like dining New Americana cuisine.

New York Butter sauce is unique (buttery tabasco taste), they have weekly specials, cocktails and entree during the week. 

This location is very close to Vaughan Mills. SW Corner of Rutherford and Weston Rd. 

Note: From my fiancee, don't order asian inspired anything in a non-asian restaurant. The Thai Chicken Salad wasn't that good. Sauce is weird.  :p"}
{"text":"Food was below average. My son ordered shrimp and scallops pasta, literally 4 shrimps and 1 scallop. Tacos were average. I ordered coffee at the end and waitress brought spoon which was unwashed and stuff on it, disgusting. C'mon you are serving coffee and you don't see the condition of stirring spoon. I am not coming again."}
{"text":"Seems like the only consistency here is the inconsistency of everything. I really enjoy the food (wings, deep fried pickles, fajitas, gourmet grilled cheese, etc), drink menu (strong bow on tap and daily drink specials) , and atmosphere (sports on tv and patio)  of Turtle Jack's. This is the only location that almost always disappoints, especially when it comes to the service. This place is close to home which is the only reason I've given it so many chances. On my last visit with two friends, the sever brought us waters and never came back to take our orders. We waited 45 mins and she acknowledged us twice, signaling \"one second\" with her finger. It wasn't at all busy inside. We got fed up and headed to All Star Wings down the street. 10 times busier yet the service was 10 times better"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants.  I eat here often.  The price is fair.  The service is usually top notch.  The food is excellent."}
{"text":"Our group ordered:
Raspberry mojito - Presentation was nice but not sweet enough. 
Raspberry lemonade- Good balance and taste.
Melonade - Very refreshing drink with watermelon and hint of mint. 
Arnold Palmer- Taste like ice tea with a hint of sourness
Coors Light- Too watery
Chicken wings- Good amount of seasoning, not too oily, and crispy. Recommend!
Chicken quesadilla- More cheese would be better. Good portion size.

Tip:
After 9pm, there are half price appetizers, $5 domestic pints, $5 house pour wine and $5 mixed drinks. Great deal

Service:
When we first came in, our group was pretty big (15people) so there wasn't enough servers to serve us. We had to self serve to set up the tables together. Drinks took a long time.

Atmosphere:
Lots of TV's at every angle and fun hip music. Would recommend coming with a group to hang out."}
{"text":"I never get tired of eating here, the quality of the food and customer service is exceptional! Chicken Fingers, Poutine, Nachos with fresh jalapeno's, chicken wrap, chicken Parmesan and the Skors Brownie are all my favourites here."}
{"text":"Over cooked Basa Fish and Over cooked chicken fajitas, was very disappointed and definitely won't be back here again"}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES
This place is surprizingly good. I hadn't been to a TJ's in years when this location opened up around the corner. I heard they had good wings so I checked it out. I've had a few things here and generally speaking, I find it to be one of the best mid-range sit-down resto/bar chains. Basically, it's better than Kelsey's and Shoeless Joe's.

DEALS 
Mon - Wings and Tall Boys
Tues - Corona's and Faijitas
Wed - Burgers and drafts
Sun - $11 domestic pitchers

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
Wings - Yeah, they're good. Maybe not great but they certainly give you a lot of options between sauces(try the NY Butter), size (2 sizes, go for the big ones), cooking style (convected vs bbq, I'm still undecided) and probably something else. The obvious genius here is you'll go back a million times trying every possible combination. 

BBQ Chicken Salad - Really, really good. Loaded with BBQ chicken, corn, black beans, tomatoes, etc. I'm pretty sure I subbed out the ranch dressing for something lighter. 

It's actually a huge menu. I've had the fajitas, they're good. Just looking over the menu now I've gotta try the King Club sandwich, the Big Wing sandwich, the Canadian Smokehouse burger and the NY Chicken. Now if only I had a lame girlfriend to take out to shitty places like this.

SERVICE NOTES
Decently swift service from decently swift servers.

LOCATION NOTES
Located in the Longo's plaza on the SE corner of Trafalgar and Dundas. I'm pretty sure there's a patio but now I can't remember. Inside it's split 1/2 bar, 1/2 restaurant. 

HUMOUROUS STORY
Drunk Tip #1: Try to drink on patios as much as possible. Being outside lends itself nicely to both spontaneous puking and theft. At the TJ's in Meadowvale I used to go out for cheap Corona's with my buddy Sean. At the end of the night we'd always order one more and then just walk out the patio gate. Makes the walk home a lot more manageable."}
{"text":"Great response by a local touchstone to the upscale onslaught of movies and Milestones."}
{"text":"While on a sick day, we thought we would stop off and get a small lunch here. My wife ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with loaded fries and I ordered the beer and cheddar soup, both were really good.service was great.a little on the expensive side, but overall very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Cool patio,  service was good. Ordered the full caesar salad no bacon and the portion was so small I thought I must be a half salad. I asked the waitress if it was a mistake and she told me no that is the size. She was nice enough to get me another side salad so that it almost passed for a meal. For 10$ I'd go to longos for a much better salad."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday evening for drinks with a few girls & immediately situated myself into one of the 2 luxurious outdoor patio sets by a stone wall centre. There's only 2 sets while the rest are basic plastic types of tables/chairs. The bistro rattan sets seat about 5 people with lots of leg room and a small middle table for a few drinks and 2 apps (max) 

The place was packed by 9:30pm and even with just one waitress, the drinks and apps flowed in on good timing. 

we had a \"scooner\" of Miller (sp?). Which is basically 2 pints in a mug that looks like it was stolen from the giant living up in Jack's beanstalk. Seriously. My wrist could barely hold it up without my other hand supporting the bottom. 
2 Canadians (bottle) 
2 ice teas 
1 MDG (bottle) for yours truly 
guacamole app 
Greek salad and blackened chicken flat bread 
bruschetta 

total came to : $68.00 between 6 people. 

Everyone was relaxed and it was a typical summer evening with everyone thinking the same thing. 
\"This place should seriously consider offering a shisha menu for the patio\" 
Okay fine, I was the only one thinking this. 

But on the real, how fun would this place be if they did in fact offer shisha on the patio?. Just putting it out there S'auga.

Worst pasta in Vaughan"}
{"text":"Turtle Jack's is packed on Friday night! It was difficult even finding a parking spot in the little plaza it's located in.

Here's a summary of what went down:
1. Very dark inside - not sure whether they're trying to give off a romantic vibe or trying to make it difficult for you to see what you're eating. 
2. My Blackened Basa was a little bit dry but went well with the potato puree and guacamole on top
3. Friend #1 thought that his Bison Meatloaf was way too salty. 
4. Friend #2 thought that his burger was very dry 
5. Friend #3 thought that her buffalo fingers were 'meh' 
6. Servers are very friendly and didn't mind splitting bills for us.

Prices are similar to Jack Astor's, Moxies, Montanas and Earls, but food was truly 'meh'."}
{"text":"For those of you wondering, \"Can you get a great burger at a chain restaurant that doesn't specialize in burgers?\" Yes, the answer is yes. The answer, my friend, is Turtle Jack's.

I tried the Big Kahuna burger and it was great. The hand-formed burger patty had a strong beefy flavour, a nice coarse grind, and it was juicy and just a touch pink. Such burger perfection in a chain restaurant. It was a grand thing. I was speechless. Technically I was speechless because my gob was full of delicious beef, grilled fresh pineapple, and jerk mayo, but it was indubitably a great burger. I inhaled it. 

The sweet potato fries were a touch limp. They could have used a bit more time to crisp up, but the flavour was great and I loved pairing them with the jerk mayo.

I also tried my dining companion's order of ribs and they were juicy and flavourful. I know what I'm ordering if I can ever convince myself to not order a burger."}
{"text":"This is another one of those places that I sometimes get dragged to by friends. There's a location sort of close by (I wish there wasn't) and that's why we sometimes end up there.

I have to mention that firstly, I hate the decor. I'm not sure why, and I couldn't really tell you any exact reasons, I just really don't like it. 

As far as the food goes, just stick to the burger, it's \"okay\". Also worth mentioning are the steaks. I find that the steaks are an insult to steak lovers, and anybody who calls Turtle Jack's a steakhouse should be hanged. 

I'm not really opposed to chain restaurants like some people are. Some great ones exist; Ruth's Chris, the Keg. As long as a restaurant is enjoyable I don't care if it's standalone or a chain. On the other hand, I am opposed to turtle jacks."}
{"text":"One of my worst dining experiences.
Went here with a small group of people for dinner on a slow night yet somehow it still took almost an hour for our food to arrive... which they somehow managed to screw up half of our orders. Got the apple brie burger which tasted really strongly of horseradish (couldn't finish it). 
Tried my friends fajitas which where good, but only after they replaced the wraps which they had brought out wayyy before the the rest of the food and they all stuck together while we were waiting. 
Our original server who took our orders seemed nice but the girl who brought us our food (dumped our plates on the table and walked away) was rude. 
My friend politely mentioned that his steak was cold. The server left and came back and tried to argue that his steak couldn't be cold because it was right off the grill. 
It's not like we were a group of people hard to please - all of us are pretty laid back when it comes to dining. But the timing, food, and service were awful."}
{"text":"The staff needs to work on being more friendlier.

This is a nice place to stop by for some drinks. We ordered the bang bang shrimp for appetizers along with the buffalo chicken fingers. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I started to go back to Jacks after they renovated and changed their menu. The food is great with a new selection of wings and burgers. Service could be better and faster by still friendly and accommodating. Bison burger and wings are a go to."}
{"text":"Decent burger.  Had bbq sauce too.
Lauren great server and cute too."}
{"text":"Went here on the 21st of August, got the Cajun chicken penne pasta. I ended up getting sick later on in the evening. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Service was actually really friendly, but slow.  Food is good but very small portions for what you pay for .."}
{"text":"I love the roaster wings here. They are amazing. Even if your not in the mood for sauce their naked wings are amazing!! So juicy, tasty and so perfectly crispy. These are a must try for everyone. You will not be disappointed.

Hey you meat lovers!! The burgers are to die for!!! Best burgers I have had in a long time.... very long time. Juicy, thick, well spiced and perfectly cooked.

The salads always taste amazing and made perfectly.  I'm picky so I make a lot of changes to my salads and they always make it 100% prefect. 

The desserts are to die for. I love the brownie/cookie bites. So good.  I always order 2 because my fiance like to eat them on me. 

They have a short brown which is amazing and a great portion .

This place is amazing for any meal and late nights with friends. I would recommend everyone try this place. There is something for everyone so no one will leave unhappy.

Xoxo happy eating."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful! 
The service was poor. 
Had a reservation for 17 people. Upon arrival there was 1 table about to leave and another table of about 6 people arrived. The service was really slow. Beverages were slow and incorrect, sides were missing from meals and the wait time was ridiculously long. Not 100% sure why we had to wait so long for watered down pop because the restaurant was pretty empty.  Without our party the staff to customer ratio was 1:1"}
{"text":"I ordered Melonade, the Friday Special. It is only $6.  I ate the slice of watermelon that comes with the drink. Even the slice of watermelon has the mint flavour. The mint is very refreshing. The drink tastes good but a little bit sweet to my taste. The only negative thing I would like to comment on is the watermelon meat is not blended in the drink. It does not come with any spoon."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant to go to if you are in a large group. We had lunch here with about 30 people which they were not able to handle. It took over an hour for us to receive our food. The food was nothing special and in most cases was probably sitting on a warmer for much longer than needed. Food did not arrive at the same time. Hungry eyes watching others eat. Our VP was not happy. We never returned here again for our department functions."}
{"text":"Great service. I had the pad thai: dont get it! Tiny portion, mixture of sweet flavors that shouldnt be in there, no peanut flavor, and the tofu tasted like weird cheese. Their brownie dessert is great for sharing!"}
{"text":"Place overall is good. I came here for the wings. They changed where they get their wings 6 mos ago and now the wings are smaller like normal bars but the price is the same....?. Over $2.00 a damp wing!!!
GO  have the roast beef sandwich, it is recommended. ..

1 star deduction for the wing robbery"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience with the food. The only reason they got the 2 star was because of service & the facility.

I went with a group of coworkers to have lunch, seating and parking were not a problem. The waitress was very friendly and active.

I ordered their Salmon burger. It was breaded & fried crisp, topped with tartar sauce, cucumbers, lettuce, tomato & onion sprouts. Sounds delicious right? well it wasn't it was quite dry and tasteless. I enjoyed more of the Caesar salad I got on the side. I would have just said Oh its bar food but for the prices they charge; one would expect better taste."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Love the semi-rustic decor and the ambiance. Ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer and they were crunchy and awesome (I usually hate fried foods). I ordered a Canadian beer that was good also. My entree was cajun chicken with steamed veggies over basmati rice and it was really tasty!! My friend had the tilapia with veggies and mashed potatoes and that was awesome as well. Wait staff was very friendly. For dessert we had the muskookies and those were delicious! I'd definitely return again next time I'm in Canada to try out some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"i came here to catch the 3rd and 4th quarter of the Seahawks game.

it was busy and loud and I couldn't really hear the commentary for the game - asked for the volume to be turned up but it never happened.

ordered a poutine, side of mushrooms and a veggie burger - had to send the mushrooms back because it wasn't what I expected from the description. 

service was amazing but the food wasn't good. don't see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"Wednesday night at this restaurant was busy but not too busy. There was no wait at the door. We were led promptly to our table. The wait for a drink order was a little longer than expected based on how busy it was. Staff did their part to up sell on drinks. Dinner was hot and correctly made. The cheese dip is nothing to write home about.  It's mostly cream cheese and thawed spinach. Lacks a richness you would expect from a good cheese dip. Comes with options of a crunchy tortilla or soft naan bread.  Burger was decent. Fries we typical of a place like this, thawed from frozen.  Staff were friendly and multiple people checked in on our dining experience."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and decor here.  It feels very comfortable and can be an enjoyable place to stay for hours eating, drinking and catching up with family and friends.  The temperature and air circulation is very comfortable.

The service here is excellent.  The staff know the menu well, act very professional and always walking around with a friendly smile.  I actually like how the ladies here are dressed on the classier side than the \"slutty\" side like most \"up-scaling\" restaurants seem to be trending.

The food itself is very good - nothing to complain about.  But so far, of all the items I have tried in this visit and previous to this, I haven't found that \"wow\" factor.  Mind you, it still is delicious and the cost of the meal is quite reasonable considering the excellent service and atmosphere.

The dessert menu is something to definitely come back to for that late night craving or social gathering.

Will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"I like the ambience of this place, warm and inviting and kid friendly. They used to offer a free treat for kids but that happens inconsistently. We go once a month and enjoy good quality food. Wings are amazing, with tasty blue cheese sauce with real bits of blue cheese. Bison burger has a delicious meaty taste. Wished they'd have beef ribs and a few new things on the menu for those who come often. I had a dessert caramel brownie and it was too sugary."}
{"text":"Great burger! And we Americans tried the poutine for the first time and simply loved it. This is a nice laid back grill/burger type place that worked out perfect for a lunch while on vacation."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the staff is friendly. Parking is tough to find on a Saturday night, you might find some spots behind the theatre. 
I really liked their nachos with chicken and guacamole, they had a layer of cheese sauce drizzled aside from the regular cheese toppings. The main part of my meal was the 10 piece Roasters (regular/naked) wings which comes with celery and carrots and a blue cheese or ranch dipping sauce....
I got 5 wings tossed in Red Chilli Thai and 5 wings tossed in Baton Rouge. My all time favourite was the Baton Rouge though; it's a mixture of sweet and spicy and a must try!"}
{"text":"Meal portions are small, unappealing and totally overpriced."}
{"text":"Always have had a good meal. The wait staff and bartenders know the value of a chilled glass to put beer in. 
Been there about 24 times - love it."}
{"text":"To our discredit, we have returned to this Turtle Jacks far too many times. Every time, we experience some of the worst service we've ever seen in a restaurant. The straw that broke the turtle's back was our last visit when we gave up waiting for a hostess to seat us (in spite of lots of empty tables) and took refuge in the bar. We sat in our booth for over half an hour, and no one saw fit to ask what we were doing there. We saw the only waitress in the area flit by us several times, never once glancing our way. Finally, after those painful 30 minutes, we got up and walked out the front door, and there was our waitress having a smoke. We told her she sucked and that we would never come back again. And we won't. Don't say we didn't warn you."}
{"text":"I have been to Turtle Jack's three times now and it's about time they got my Yelp. They have the best wings I have ever had, or can recall in recent years. I've eaten at every wing place in the city and I get the most satisfaction out of TJ's. 

I feel part of their success with their wings derives from the notion that they allow you some customization with your order, in addition to the fact that their so damn satisfying. For example, you have the option to order the \"Roasters\" - large wings, or \"Fryers\" classic style size wings. Secondly, you can have them \"Dusted\" - a light/crispy coating on the wings, or \"Regular\" - as is. Thirdly! You can request that your wings are thrown on the BBQ to get that authentic Q flavour, or baked in the convection oven to really bake the flavour right into the wing. All these options are up to you, and although it may seem confusing or overwhelming, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out you want Roasters Dusted on the Q, or in the Oven. 

TJ's boasts a plethora of  sauces which are mostly damn good and simply named if I may add - simple wing sauces seem to be a thing of the past when nowadays you get sauce names like Farmer's Daughter and Montezuma's Revenge. Truthfully, I'm a sucker for corn rows and manicured toes, actually no that's Nelly. I'm a sucker for buffalo sauce on my wings, simply butter w/ Frank's Red Hot. On a scale of hotness from 1 to 10 I'd rate Frank's at 3, I don't order Buffalo sauce for Frank's heat, rather the tartness which derives from the high vinegar content. It fuses with the butter so well I'm in heaven like Fred Astaire whenever I slay it. Damn it, I just drooled into my keyboard fak. 

Buffalo sauce at TJ's is called \"NY Butter Sauce\", and you can order it \"Extreme\" and they will make it a bit spicier for you. Other great sauces are their original BBQ, Hotter than Hot, Baton Rouge, Ross sauce (chili/honey) and Red Thai Chili. Overall I reckon the wings to be bombness and I think I've spoken enough about them. 

Next we talk apps quickly. The onion rings are the biggest I have ever seen in my life. They are roughly the size of huge donuts and arrived perfectly crisp. I did however ask the waitress to ensure the rings were well done because TJ's fries are horrendous. They are not double fried so the insides are like mashed potatoes. Half cooked fries are probably my biggest pet peeve in the eating out game, and I have no tolerance for it. Onion Rings are great to share and I can not emphasize how big they are. The order will come with 5-6 rings, equivalent to probably 15 average sized ones. 

In terms of steaks, ribs etc. at this restaurant I haven't tried anything besides what I mentioned above. The fried pickles are apparently incredible, however the price point is way off at $9.99, if I'm not mistaken you get 1 pickle cut into 6 pieces then deep fried. How did they come to that valuation? Kevin O'Leary of Dragon's Den would blast them if he found out. 

In closing, a nice cozy spot to slay some wings, a remixed Kelsey's if you would. Be warned this Vogell location is a test spot so what you experience at this location or what you have read here may not necessarily carry through at other venues."}
{"text":"I am torn between three stars and four for Turtle Jack's because we actually had a really bad mishap during our visit but the food was surprisingly all right. 

We had a party of four, and I ordered a veggie burger without cheese with a side of fries and my husband asked for the same.  I'm not sure how, \"I'll have the same thing\" = beef burger? (Especially when you brought me a veggie.) 

The waitress didn't apologize and eventually the manager (I guess?) came over and asked how he liked his veggie burger but didn't apologize for the mishap or even offer to compensate for the fact that he had to wait an extra fifteen minutes for his meal while the rest of us ate.  I guess because my husband didn't yell or get upset, I guess they didn't feel the need to go out of their way to adjust our first impressions.  Something like that is really not okay in my opinion.

That said, mistakes do happen and I know that I wouldn't be opposed to eating there again if our family in Mississauga wants to dine out.  If it was a habitual thing, obviously this review would have fewer stars."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times recently. Must say, it was better than I thought. The chicken wings were the best I have eaten. Tried the Chicken Fajitas, Burger, Bisson meat loaf. All was very good. They have a brownie score dessert - simply amazing if you like chocolate. Service was good each time. Decent beer selection. A little pricey vs. your average pub menu but worth it in my opinion. Recommended."}
{"text":"It's your run of the mill chain sports bar and grill. The food is good. The kids meal comes with a free toy so that was a surprise. The service was very good."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place. The concept location, etc is good in theory but over the past yeah my experience is just meh. Every time my husband and I go here winter spring or summer, the service is always slow, the mixed drinks are weaker than normal, the food is either sub par, cold, or undercooked, and the customer service is just minimal. On top of that, this place has spotty wifi, is not dog friendly (apparently you can only have tiny dogs, no average or mid sized dogs allowed) - and the patio lacks uniform or organization. The past two times I was sat we got our food or dinks after people that were sat after us. Like I said, nice, clean and good in theory but it's not worth it if you don't have a good experience."}
{"text":"Food is decent and staff are great. Good place to grab a drink after work.It does get packed on Thursday nights that includes the parking lot! It is more of a bar/restaurant....large patio."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Our server forgot about us any times. I think part of a dining experience is not only the food but also the interaction you have with your server. 

We went there for drinks and some apps. At first we waited just a little bit for our drink order. Drinks came and nachos came. The nacho platter looked full but something was lacking. I needed more flavour. I asked for some queso. 5 min, 10 min, 15 min...all went by. We wanted to order more food.  It wasn't not bust at all. She finally returned and I was annoying and done. She admitted that she forgot about us and our table. I politely asked for the cheque and that was the end of my experience at this turtle jacks. Will not be returning and will not recommend this place either. 

We left and went elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Go for beer and service with attitude. No thanks i will take my business elsewhere.. 
 This is not the first time either, fix your service get some proper management in here and your reviews will improve.."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday night while in town for business.  We sat outside and service was good.  Had some Wayne Gretski pinot Grigio and a burger with poutine on the side. Food was good and left with a happy belly."}
{"text":"Turtle Jack's seems to be a wholly Mississauga Phenomenon that caters to anyone looking for an alternative to the Casey's/Kelsey's monotony that can be available around Toronto.

They have recently updated their menu but what many coworkers and I go there for has always been the big wing sandwich.  Its literally a...big...wing....sandwich.  Think wings, think a sauce of your choice (almost all are good...not very hot), forget the bones, and put that crispy chicken between two pieces of bread...and you've got an excuse for a sandwich.

I'm a huge fan of wings so this is a great option when you don't want the mess but you want all the wing experience.

Their wings are unique too with a ton of options...roaster or fryer, dusted or regular, this sauce or that sauce (again for the hot lovers, the hot here is mild to medium anywhere else).  And lastly a neat new option, Barbie (barbecued extra to give it more of a barbecue flavour) or convected, to give it an oven flavour.  I'm a big fan of the Barbie.

Food - Never had push back from anyone I've gone there with on bad food, just not great (minus the Big Wing Sandwich).  

Beer - Last time I went I believe they had Stella which is always nice after a long day at work or after some meetings.

Service - They have really tried to upscale (read Kelsey's /Moxies type) their service and decor to cater to more of the business clientele especially during Lunch times.  However, it isn't dazzling..

Loyalty Program - while never offered I understand they have a loyalty program where you get points for $$s spent, but get back $$s after you reach a certain points amount.  I'll probably stick to collecting aeroplan points and avoid having an extra card to carry around but a neat option to consider if you fall in love with the place (or take customers/team members out for food....a lot).  Wonder if it actual increases loyalty...

Overall, not a bad experience.  I need to try a salad or something else there but for now, if you like wings, this is a decent option in the West end."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch only because we were in the area and it ended up being a regretful decision 
Mr Handsome had the shrimp and sea scallop pasta; such a letdown, not only really bland but there were only 3 teeny tiny scallops. No fresh parm or black pepper were offered and when we spoke up about it the server/manager said that the kitchen manager put it down to the fact that the price of scallops has gone up, what!! why should that impact our meal? add more scallops or raise the price because frankly I don't care- this was a  $20 dish by the way and we had to pay an extra  $1.49  for 2 pieces of dried out garlic toast 
Hubs was sipping on his beer while I watched the bartender get out my sangria glass and walk away to do something else.....it took awhile but I finally got that sangria and it was delicious 
I had the Bison burger- no bun and it was pretty tasty 
The bartender assured us a discount and then brought us someone else's bill, sheesh 
When all was said and done they did remove hubby's beer from the tab as well as an extra discount but I wouldn't go back to this establishment again"}
{"text":"I went here recently with my boyfriend and two other couples. The only thing that saved the experience was how much we were able to joke and laugh amoungst ourselves about how horrible it was! We basically made a game out of it like if I ask for water how long will it take to get here? Basically the service was some of the worse I've ever experienced in a resturant. Our waitress was super slow and would purposely (it seemed) walk by without making eye contact. We would literally need to stand up and wave to get her attention (it took 17min and 52 seconds after our fries arrived and we asked for it to get ketchup, we timed it). The resturant wasn't even that busy and we could hear the other tables around us complaining too. 

In terms of food it was meh, when we got it. One of our friends sweet potatoe fries were completely uncooked (especially when you compared them to everyone elses) so after complaining the waitress took them away and brought a new batch literally with our bills(27 minutes and 14 seconds later). I had ordered their \"philly burger\" (buger with sauteed onion, peppers and mushrooms on it) but the waitress brought me the philly steak sandwich instead. She tried to force it upon me, and I was like no thanks I ordered a burger, I don't want an sandwich. So after a long debate and lots of huffing on her part she agreed to bring me a burger. It also arrived (althoguh understandably as a burger takes longer then fries to make) with our bill so I took it home and just had sweet potatoe fries for dinner. When the bill came she had charged me for both the burger and the sandwich and then it took forever to get her attention to deal with it. They had also charged my boyfriend the price for a side order of sweet potatoe fries ($4.95)instead of the $1.50 upgrade with his sandwich. When we questioned it, the waitress said that was because he ordered the sandwich special which doesn't come with a side. When we pointed out that on the menu it says all burgers and sandwiches come with a choice of side she wouldn't agree that it was confusing  just saying that specials were different and not on the menu. When he had ordered the sandwich and asked for the fries she didn't say it was an additional charge and since everyone else's meal had come with fries how should he have known. So in the end we only paid for my burger, not the sandwich, and my boyfriend paid the full fry fee. And then left a 1% tip, that's all.  

Overall the service was absolutely unbelieveably horrible. The food was worse then average. The only reason it's getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because the the decor was ok and the resturant itself could be ok with new staff/managment and chef. And unlike my other 1 stars it really exists and I didn't get food poisioning :)"}
{"text":"I was there last Sunday (Mother's Day).  We arrived a 4:45 and the place was fairly empty.  Good food.  Good atmosphere.  LOUSY SERVICE.  It took a while to get our menus.  We ordered our drinks and appetizers.  It was a while until our drinks arrived.  The waitress took our dinner order.  About 10 minutes after the drinks arrived, the appetizers finally arrived (Nachos and Calamari).  The server (not our waitress) did not bring any plates with the appetizer.  So we requested them.  The server never returned.  I set my watch timer when the appetizers arrived to see how long it would take for the entrÃ©es to arrive.  The answer:  40 minutes.  I don't know if it was a waitress problem or a kitchen problem.  Either way....the LOUSY SERVICE certainly put a damper on the outing."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, with amazing service! Came by on a rainy night with some friends, as we somehow decided on this restaurant. Had been here a couple times before, so knew what to expect. 

Was welcomed right when we got in, and had to wait a couple minutes for a table, but the manager came to apologize right away! Sat down and our server greeted us and let us know about the menu. I wasn't sure if I want the Coors Banquet which was on special, so she brought over a sample for me to try! Always nice!

I ordered the Bison Meatloaf, and my friends had the Bison Burger and Wings. All were quite good, but my Bison Meatloaf was delicious, as the meatloaf was nice and soft, and was wrapped in bacon! Everything is better with bacon. Wings were amazing, and the NY Butter Sauce was great. We wanted to try it, so the server gave us some on the side to try!

Overall a great night, but was made better with exceptional service from our amazing server! Definitely a nice location to sit and have dinner if you're looking for some American food."}
{"text":"When we first got here (party of three) at 3:30 in the afternoon there wasn't a host present at the door so we ended up seating ourselves which worked out fine but was confusing as we weren't sure we're we should sit... 

Thankfully our server was a pleasure. She was very friendly, attentive and she got our orders 100% right. Our food came really quick and overall we were all really pleased with the service. 

Our only real issues were the portion sizes. Personally If I order a 15 dollar salad I really do expect it to be impressive where in reality it was about the size of a half size salad at Wendy's. 

I ordered the southwest salad without the guac (I know, I'm one of those anti guac people) and it was a really tasty salad don't get me wrong. It was just the size that really turned me off. I also thought it was weird how cold the whole dish was - I figured the beans/chicken would be hot. 

Someone else in our party ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich (not sure of menu name) with fries and again the portion of fries was rather small especially for the price. 

I would probably go again, but I'm not rushing back there anytime soon. I definitely will skip the salad if I do."}
{"text":"Very poor service by the staff and asked the management 3 times to fix the game on the screen and all we got was excuses"}
{"text":"One star for the food.. rest based on customer service. Bartenders aren't the friendliest servers. She brought over a wet glass and I asked her to switch it out. Also my water glass smelt like chemicals and was fresh out of the dish washer. Once she returned with a dry glass and a new water glass, I thanked her but received no acknowledgment of my thank you. She just dropped the glasses on the table and left. I waited 15 mins for the server to take our order. This is on a Sunday evening, so the restaurant isn't even busy. I'm not really surprised though as this location has consistently brought me bad service-- last time I'm going here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Before it was part of this new chain operation the chicken wings were the best in town. I went for dinner Sunday night with a friend and I of course ordered the chicken wings. Got the roaster lighty dusted, saucy cajun and then grilled. I joked with the gentleman who took our order, who seemed like the manager, that I wanted my wings \"to look like these\" and pointed at the picture in the menu. He laughed and said \"good luck with that\" . Its not that the food was bad, but it was just mediocre at best. Seemed very lazy. 

If you like wings, I would try the TJ Chicago's in north Brampton - this is the original TJs and still makes the wings like the old Turtle Jack's did. Plus for those who know, TJ Chicago's still has the new york butter flavour - which the chain got rid of."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised   at the quality of the food.  I have gone to many of these kinds of restaurants (BP, Moxie etc) but this one takes the cake. The food was actually really welled prepared and served on time. The bbq chicken wrap was one of the best wraps I have ever had. Also, you can tell their fires were made in-house. 

Another good thing about this restaurant was it atmosphere. It was warm, welcoming and peaceful after a long days work. They had a fireplace going which was amazing after coming in from outside where it was -20. 

Our server was super nice and came back several times just to see how we were doing. He made us drinks, even though it was so-called off season for our drinks. This restaurant will see me again real soon."}
{"text":"My first time at Turtle Jacks, had lunch today with my girls for a get together and everything was good.

Great customer service, our server was fantastic...too bad I forgot his name to be able to give him credit.

Food was good, we got bruschetta and 3 cheese dip for apps and Greek salad, fish and chips, blackened basa and my daughter had chicken finger with fries. A good number of items to choose from but not too many as I'm very indecisive.  The decor was very appealing and cozy as well.

I would come here again for another get together."}
{"text":"Food great, specials early fits my schedule! My bartender Jen was awesome, ask for her!"}
{"text":"We had dinner and drinks here four nights in a row after a convention in the DoubleTree. The staff is GREAT! The food is tasty and fast. We very much enjoyed our time here. The breakfast buffet in the morning for the hotel was not super. The food was sometimes cold and not great tasting. However, the restaurant for lunch and dinner was really good. The wait staff was attentive, engaging and kind. Drinks at the bar were very slow to come as the bartender seemed overwhelmed and overworked. Ordering from servers was much faster."}
{"text":"If I was in a position of power, I'd arrest this place for the service. Absolutely reprehensible. We're seated, all's fine until low and behold, we'd be like this for the next 15 minutes. In the front of the restaurant! Finally a server arrives, and asks for drinks. Not mind numbingly painful, but not respectable either. 5 minutes 33 seconds I timed. Next comes waiting for our orders. It took 25 minutes to bring the plates out, then another 10 for food! We had explicitly asked for salad with dressing on the side, and this \"strange request\" wasn't noted. We ask if we can have another, and it would take 20 minutes! FOR A @#$%&%$ SALAD! Somebody get Ramsay in here! The Blackened chicken got the order right, but was quite a small portion. Chicken wings had no seasoning or flavor, just small badly fried chicken. Ribs looked like they were tanning for hours, small and remarkably dry. Kids pasta was fine, but lacked a substantial portion of vegetables for the side. I had the Bison Burger and while a decent size, tasted nothing like advertised. Tomato soup had soggy croutons and no cheese. But the worst travesty was the side. IF ONE DIDNT KNOW, LOBSTER MASHED POTATOES HAVE LOBSTER IN THEM, imagine that Einstein! Not a sliver of lobster in both sides, just \"Mashed Potatoes\". Nothing on em, just potatoes. A refill for water took another 15 minutes, but by then we were conditioned to the torture. Please, I beg of you don't go here. I really wanted this place to be great, but hey, optimism is unrealistic at Turtle Jacks.

{"text":"This is my first time at Turtle Jacks Richmond Hill and I was very disappointed with the service provided. We came in at a very slow time (2:30ish) and we had to get up and FIND our server in the restaurant every time we needed something. We ordered the Salmon Burger which was very good and the Avocado Chicken Tacos which we had to send back because the tortillas were too hard to eat! Overall, the main issue was the service definitely was not the experience I expected."}
{"text":"Food here is horrible and the prices and crazy for the quality of food. We had nacho loaded with lettuce for the meal we had salads and they where both soggy and lacking dressing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here frequently because we are addicted to the Butter Tart dessert. It's the absolute best dessert ever. The food is usually pretty great too, but the service is inconsistent and that's why I give them a 3 star rating. Whenever we go we hope to get Kimberly as our waitress because she knows us, always gives us great service and she is very nice. She always stops and takes the time to ask us how we are enjoying are food etc. Other times with different waitresses, they will just do a quick walk by to ask how everything is rather then actually taking a moment to stop and ask."}
{"text":"This is a solid 4 out of 5. 
As a group of 4 we hit this spot for lunch not knowing what to expect.  This was a total impulse.  We were seated immediately by some very summery casually dressed young server almost immediately and the attentive service continued right to the end, now the place was not busy but we all appreciated the attention.  
It was kind of funny how two of us ordered the french onion soup and Caesar salad and the other two of us ordered the french dip roast beef sandwich.  But hey you pick what you want.  Now, i had the french dip and it was tasty i had the greek salad on the side and that was spot on, i would not change a thing.  The two in our party who had the soup and salad said they would do it again for sure so going by smell alone i may have to try that on one of my lighter appetite days.  
NO time for desert, we had a festival to go to.  
All things said and done i will return to try some of the other menu items.
Good on ya Turtle Jacks's  I'm a fan and looks like the other 3 in our group are with me on that sentiment."}
{"text":"Had the blackened chicken on naan as well as the baked onion soup. The sandwich was tasty but could have used some more chicken. The soup was nearly inedible due to the amount of salt used! Service was decent."}
{"text":"A regular here at Turtle Jack's whether it's a Friday or Saturday night.  I love the ambience of this restaurant, especially with the heated fireplace once you walk into the restaurant.  You are always greeted within moments of stepping foot inside but you can usually find me in the bar area.  I only came here a couple of times for dinner but I have never been disappointed with the food.  The Chicken Fingers and the Blackened Chicken on Naan are my go-to dishes and I highly recommend them.  I've also tried their Beef Barley Soup, which I'm obsessed over, when I want something to warm me up.  As for dessert and to satisfy my sweet tooth, I HIGHLY recommend their Skor Brownie Obsession or their Fire 'N Ice as it is to die for!! I have yet to try any of their other desserts because I can't get enough of their Skor Brownie Obsession.  As for their drinks, the daily drinks specials are lacking a little.. The specials that they offer on Fridays and Saturdays are not that great, in my opinion.  If they had pitchers of beer or wine specials, I'd come on a daily basis.  But I mainly come after dinner just to hang out and have a drink with some friends and watch the basketball games.  The customer service here is phenomenal and being a regular, we always have the same waitress serving us, Julisa.  She loves what she does, she's enthusastic and friendly and very approachable. She's also always on top of topping you off with another drink or anything else you may need to make your experience a good one.  They also offer a TLC loyalty card, which entitles you to collect points so you can recieve a dollar amount credited to your loyalty card. All I have to say is, check out Turtle Jack's cause everyone needs some TLC!"}
{"text":"I went on a weekend night and liked the fact that they had a deejay. Really enjoyed their drink menu. As a chicken wing enthusiast. I love the wings here. Breaded and crispy with a nice portion. I have not really tried anything else here, or maybe i cant recall. My friend did order a fettecuni, which i tasted and was nothing special. Another definite treat was definately the SKOR chocalate brownie. Felt so guilty eating it, but its one of those guilty but good feelings!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice and clean staff very friendly and welcoming this is my second time here and it good"}
{"text":"I was thinking this place wouldn't be as good as I thought walking in! Good thing they proved me wrong! 

Anyways I got the berry mojito and it was really good (4)
My aunt got the blue raspberry martini which she enjoyed 

To start I shared a warm goat cheese appetizer with my cousin (4.5) - not as good as the kegs but still wonderful components on the dish , they roasted the garlic and tomatoes for flavor plus on that and also fig jam which I've been loving in my meals! 

Garlic Caesar (4) - pretty good Caesar salad, my brother always orders these now 

Tomato, basil and prosciutto grilled cheese (4) - this was also very good, used proper bread and it was flavorful just wish they didn't pile on the cheese soooooo heavy and put more basil 

Others got wings, burgers, or wraps which they all enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Forget about the the guacamole and chips, the pack from Costco taste better than the water down version unseasoned one they served here  

Got the soup and salad combo, the soup tastes like canned tomato soup and the quinoa salad has only a pinched of quinoa and very little dress"}
{"text":"Hit me if I come back...I had the misfortune of revisiting this place twice... And twice left regretting money spent and calorie wasted (and I'm not even health conscious). Overall, wait staff are friendly and fast, but little can be done to help the food situation. Food was almost unbearably bad and yet the price charged seems unjustifiable. The burgers are dry and greasy...barely anything memorable except to sense of regret that I passed on getting Macdonald's earlier in the evening. The pasta was tiringly average yet once again, they decide to charge gourmet prices. Same goes with most things on their menu. Memorable was their French onion soup... And not in a good way. It was lukewarm with the taste of artificial broth and lack the taste onion and mushy floating bits sporting a nasty questionable indistinguishable cheese mess (at least I hope it was cheese), hardly appetizing. I will not be back, at least not by choice."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Must try the turtle wings! My absolute favorite! We ordered so much food. I'm not one to ever finish my food either."}
{"text":"Turtle Jacks in Muskoka is great, has a beautiful patio and on a warm day is always packed.  The franchised copies, such as this one, are comparable to all the Moxies / Earls type places.  It has a bar area with TVs and the menu is a mix of pretty much every cuisine.  

They have a couple good dishes here.  The wings are done very well.  Fish tacos, not bad.  A lot of the other food is very heavy and sometimes greasy."}
{"text":"The wings looked good. The burger was drenched in the signature sauce making some of the burgers... Gross! If you don't like a saucy burger don't get it! But again the wings looked good! My drink also had a mouldy blueberry. Wonderful."}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch as it was a coworkers birthday! Sat in the bar area. Got busy after 12pm for lunch rush.

There was two servers in the section that managed it very well. Very efficient and prompt. Friendly front staff and attentive when servers are busy.

Ordered the avacado burger. Our food came in an average time. We ordered the burger, fish tacos and, wing in a bun (something like that lol) the tacos were very generous serving and the wings on a bun looked very good (def gonna try it next time)! The burger was cooked and dressed well. Great service for lunch!

I like this location better than the Brampton location. Much more attentive service and decent food cooked better ! Will def. come back as location serves well for big tables.

Tips:

Their wings are amazing!"}
{"text":"I have not been to this particular Turtle Jack's Restaurant  in over a year due to finding a long hair in my food, not once but TWICE. I have actually been going out of my way to go to the Turtle Jacks by Courtney Park.

On Sunday, May 22, 2016 I decided to give the restaurant another try. My friend and I decided to sit in the patio section. Even now I have no idea who my server was. I spoke with 6 different people throughout my meal. The 1st lady brought our menu's and i didn't see her again until i left the restaurant... she was outside. The 2nd lady brought our drinks and then walked passed us about 3-4 times when were clearly trying to get her attention to take our food order. Then i saw what looked like a manager, I'm not totally sure because he never introduced himself as one. I told him we had been sitting there for a long time and we need to order. He took our orders and i didn't see him again either. The 4th person was a male server who brought out our food. I had to ask him for cutlery and more drinks as no one had come to check on us the entire time our food was being made. The 5th person was a lady not sure on her position either... had to ask her for condiments. We ordered an appetizer, fish and chips and a Burger w/ a salad... you would think that they could at least bring out some ketchup. I asked for Chipotle sauce when i ordered originally,  which didn't come to the table, I had to ask for it again and my bacon was uncooked when I specifically asked for it to be well done. After our meals were finished and we had been there about 2 hours. The 6th man came by and asked us how everything was. I told him the service was terrible and I would not be returning. I explained to him everything I wrote above and he said that he felt bad that we had that experience and gave us 2 coupons each for 5$ off if we spend more then 30$... I paid 50$ for my meal alone nothing was discounted and the service was TERRIBLE. I will not spend another dollar at that restaurant. Which is a shame because when the food is done right it is delicious. Too bad the service was not able to match."}
{"text":"Truly the worst dining experience - ever!  I travel extensively and have always welcomed a stop at Turtle Jack's for the food, the service and the cottage-country feel.  So, you can imagine my disappointment when I took my family of four to this location!  There was no hostess to seat us and the waiter who initially came by provided two of four menus?!  We ordered a round of water with no ice and we exchanged jokes about the no ice seemingly establishing a rapport.  Four glasses of ice arrived each with a splash of water delivered by a different server.  The appetizers, ordered on arrival with the first pint had not been delivered for an hour and 20 minutesthe pint was long goneI The lake that Jacob is doing that wake boarding school on is Kashagawigamog approached the server and asked for either the bill or the appetizers.  The appetizers came with a good dose of excuses and a visit from the manager.  We were optimistic that we had turned a corner with an offer from the manager to pick up the tab for the appies.  After another extended wait and no sign of our mains, we left.  Hungry, disappointed and with nearly 2 hours of our lives wasted!!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. The side Caesar salads were bland. Fries undercooked. Seems like the wings are the safe choice."}
{"text":"Be aware of the slow service.  We waited for more than one hour in order to have our orders taken.  We had a large group, but it was a slow Sunday night anyway with fewer than 30 customers in the entire restaurant, so I don't understand why it would take forever for our server to come.

Food was very bland as well.  

The final bills were messed up so it took a while to get them sorted out.

I would not come back."}
{"text":"I decided to go to turtle jacks in oakville.....it was alright. I didn't pay for the dinner I guess which is why 3 stars are where it's at. 


The service is amazing. The waitresses were really friendly and helpful.  Well what about the food?

Appetizer: we had chicken rolls and they were so amazing: delicious, fresh, and the sauce was phenomenal- I highly recommend! 

I had the Atlantic salmon

It came out very fast which tells me it was cheaper quality because good things take time to make. It was very mushy and soft. It was served with plain rice and a poor excuse for 'seasonal' vegetables. * not worth $22 more like $15.....

My friend had the 'big wing dinner' he says it was overall good but tasted like there was more batter than wings. 


So overall the service was wonderful and the appetizer was yummy. 

If you are looking for a bar atmosphere and a quick fix this is the place. If you are looking for a meal that costs as well as it tastes then try elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a meal. Venue is clean and pretty well lit. Atmosphere is casual and friendly. I made a reservation earlier and arrived early, we were seated quickly. 

We placed our order after a short wait. I wanted my burger with fries and gravy, my dad ordered the shrimp and scallop pasta. My mom ordered the blackened basa (sorry, no picture). Food arrived very quickly and it was piping hot, the way we like it. Flavour is decent and not overpowering. 

The server checked on us often to ensure we were looked after. The hostess was quick on her feet too whenever we couldn't locate our server. Overall experience is great and we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty standard for anyplace with an apostrophe S in it's name - sometimes it's pretty good but I find that the service is pretty inconsistent. When the food comes promptly it's what you'd expect - often though it's seems like the wait has been way too long and sure enough the food is warm at best and sometimes cold.3 stars is \"It's Okay\" has definitely been my experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. 
Got in at 6 or so on a weeknight. Seated immediately to a nice booth.

Jade(our waitresses)  was professional AND fun. Knowledgeable about the menu, she gave us some info and gave us the time to look. While getting our drinks right away.

I had a beef rib special.  A little fatty, but TASTY!  My wife had shrimp and scallop pasta. Very tasty.

Would recommend this place immensely!"}
{"text":"Meh. Typical chain restaurant.  

Ordered blacked basa and calamari.  Basa was okay, but found it to be a bit on the salty side. Calamari was nice though.

It's probably better than Milestones, Jack Astors and Moxie's, but that's not saying much.  

Seems like a great atmosphere for drinks though."}
{"text":"We were excited to have $5 Canadian and half price appetizers. We went in at 10:25pm. Sat down waited till 10:40 before the waitress could serve us because she was alone. We ordered then she told us last call. We were surprised because we thought a bar wouldn't close at 11pm. We thought it was just the kitchen. When the food came she confirm it was closed 11 pm. The info on yelp is 12pm. We were so disappointed. The food was good too but we will not be back in weekdays again. Back to our regular now to Kelsey!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times as it's convenient as a local neighbourhood chain joint. The decor and vibe is quite nice and laid back. It does capture the Muskoka spirit quite decently in my opinion although a tad dark throughout which is compounded by the darkish hues used inside so I suppose the designer aimed to capture a fall/autumn tone. 

Food is decent while not amazing or even great. It's typical of line kitchen. I had the cajun pene today and it was decent. Pasta was cooked a bit uneven which was surprising as it is pretty easy to get right but the overall taste/texture was decent enough. 

My teenage nephew had a shrimp linguini. I found it hilarious that he actually counted the pieces of shrimp and well, for an $18 plate there were exactly 2 shrimps and 3 scallops in a plate, hardly screaming of value but passable. 

Service has always been spot on, quick and courteous which is the reason I go back here."}
{"text":"The food here is ok but the service is amazing. All of them are super friendly and have a lot of fun all the time. This place is also good to watch sports games if you like. They have a goos specials on the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding! 
What a turn around of an experience!
The service, the atmosphere (since the update)
The food presentation, quality and taste is truly great! 
They offer a gluten free menu.
It's kid friendly! The kids good is priced very well, included a drink, dessert and even a little present from the toy chest! 
After a few great visits the place deserves a 5 star all the way!

We tried booking a party for 10 (birthday) on a Friday however, and were denied reservations... something definitely to reconsider!!!"}
{"text":"This is how Muskoka feels like? Large screen televisions, Alcohol as far as the eye can see at the Bar, Horned Lighting, Boat Shelves, and some elderly Men just chilling. Those Men were perfect target for the Waitress we had that chose to schmooze them rather then attending to our needs. That fly-by \"How's everything\" was my first, DAMN she's good. 

Friend got a crappy Burger which he told me of voluntarily without any of my personal schmoozing. That I take means that he won't be using the Turtle Jack's Loyalty Card anytime soon. 

Fryers w/Medium Sauce($10.99) are small in size like my memory of Wing Machine but the Fried Skin texture was good. It had just enough crispiness at some parts while not making the insides too dry. This does give hope but you have to consider I got 10 of these small scale Wings. 

Fryers w/NY Butter Sauce($10.99) uses Tabasco but I can almost smell the Butter like when you microwave Popcorn Butter. It was Fried the same as above. This makes me curious about the Roaster sized Wings maybe for next time... 

There is an option for the Wings to be BBQ'd or Convection'd which is always nice especially if someone at the table likes Wings less saucy. Not bad at all if it wasn't for the awkward and distinct service during this afternoon.  I know we look CHEAP but I don't think a Bay Streeter would be coming your way anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food: over priced for small portions, ordered big wing dinner that excludes drink , came with some mediocre fries and few wings for $18.

Service: came in at a non-busy time for lunch, Saw the waitress twice, at the beginning to take our order and at the end when we want the bill. No such thing as service here. Waitress was semi angry semi hating her job type of expression on her face and body language 

Restaurant decor: the place is dark and just looks depressing.

The best part about this experience was there was a blackout when we were about to pay for our meals. The waitress said we don't know what's going on , which is understandable but after 30 minutes.. she was like \"do you have cash?\" Told her we only had debit and credit. They were about to keep us there until the black out comes back on, luckily bf went to find another person that knows how to do the MANUAL way of using a credit card to pay Instead of debt machine because as I said, no electricity because of blackout. So if it wasn't for that, they were going to keep people there until when? ( took about 4 hours for their power to come back on)"}
{"text":"Not sure about meals, but it gets 5 stars for drinks and appetizers.  The schooners are HUGE.  About as tall as the butter knife on the table.  There was Heineken, Coors and a handful of others on tap for pretty cheap.  The beef nachos were delicious.  We also got the three cheese dip, which was served with pitas and nachos.  Make sure you get them baked instead of fried!  The guys were also able to watch the game and service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Was here earlier tonight. My friend ordered a pitcher and it came with that tin foil looking paper that comes with a pack of cigarettes. We told the manager and she didnt seem to care, she just offered to get us another pitcher. We left and neither one of us will return. No wonder they are closing down."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. The waiter was friendly. The prices were fair and the service was prompt. The food isn't anything special but it's a good, solid, open late dinner option. No one will leave hungry and no one will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the Big Bang shrimp tacos for lunch with the house salad. It was okay I guess. The filling for the tacos were good but the soft shell taco was dry and kind of stale....I'm wondering if the tried to toast the shell? Or perhaps it sat under the heat lamp too long. My friend got the salmon burger and it seemed alright. Paid and extra 3.99 to sub in lobster mashed potatoes for fries and it definitely wasn't worth it for the tablespoon worth you get. Prices were too high for the quality and type of food you could at any other franchise chain."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and went here as it was close to the hotel. The restaurant was clean and the server was nice BUT they forgot my drink, and more importantly forgot to bring my friends meal! They apologized but it was a little too late and kind of ruined our groups experience."}
{"text":"The place recently went under new management and I must say the new manager is amazing.

We came when power outages struck across the GTA and families all came out for dinner. They were down three servers that day so service was not the fastest. My friends ordered their cocktails but I had to take 5 more minutes to decide. When I did, my drink came shortly after but my friends' had yet to come. We didn't think much of it/ forgot about it but the waitress was super apologetic about it and made sure our drinks got delivered in time. The manager himself came out with 4 shots for each of us and apologized! He told us our drinks would be free and one dessert would be on the house! 

As a bonus, when we ordered our dessert (the holy Skor Toffee Brownie) it came with two pieces of brownies instead of one since they knew we were all sharing it! Amazing! I ended up only having to pay for my Turkey Avacado Club (which was delicious and a sizable portion!)

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Heard they had a recent ownership change so we decided to give it another try.  Unlike my previous experience, the service is now top notch (polite and attentive staff) and food is great (good sized portions, fresh and not cold).

The ribs were cooked at the right temperature and very tasty with the meat sliding off the bones.   Fries (yes I love my guilty pleasure comfort food) was not soggy or greasy.  And the dessert was really good-too many choices though-gotta try some different ones next time!   My guests felt the same way about their food choices too!

The restaurant ambiance is very nice with comfortable seating in booths.  I loved the fireplace and Christmas tree at the front which gave it a nice feastive touch.   They actually have a VIP party area which is nice for gatherings.  I will definitely book it off for my next office gathering!

Definitely worth it to give this landmark restaurant at 16 and 404 another look since my previous experience years ago was not overly positive.  Looks like the new owners are moving in the right direction.  A must try place in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant we really enjoy it. I always get the wings with medium sauce (spicier than a regular medium at most places).  Kids menu is good, with good quality steak and their kids brownie is really good.  There is a treasure box that the kids like to rummage through.  Hamburgers are good and so are they sandwiches, but I'm loyal to the wings."}
{"text":"Is there a secret code for guys to take you on a first date here?? I've been taken here for 3 different first dates- like they'll come pick me up and just go to turtle jack's with no warning. So it's literally deja vu over and over again.
Meh, I didn't mind.

Turtle jacks has a dark and muskoka atmosphere; it's a nice, cozy environment and I can definitely see why all the ladies men choose to take their lady friends here. The service at turtle jack's is pretty consistent- never AMAZING but never rude. I remember once my date for the night and I stayed behind way after last call, and the waiters all put up the chairs (a sign meaning \"..hey.. you can go whenever now..\") but they never rushed us out. 

The food is ok.. nothing to brag about but nothing gross. I've had their chicken fingers here, which was meh (I prefer mcdonald's nuggets to be honest). I've also had their greek salad with chicken on top. Also meh, nothing memorable. 

In the end, all I can say is this restaurant is 'A-ok'"}
{"text":"Food was very mediocre but thankfully we had a great server who made the experience amazing. Thanks Chris!!!"}
{"text":"This place was just opened not too long ago. It has a humongous menu that was a little too big for me because I was a little overwhelmed and couldn't really decide what to order.

They have a great drinks menu that is decently priced and the food is great. I had the club, soup & salad combo and the french onion soup was ridiculously good. It was not salty, as many are but there needed to be a lot more melted cheese on top of my soup. 

I will say that they are new and with that they are going through growing pains but the kitchen was ridiculously slow. It was not at all busy and our food took approximately 45 minutes to come. That's a guestimation but it felt that long. 

Decor is very cottage life as TJ's originated in Muskoka. Great big booths that hold 6 and are really comfy. I'm certain I will return to this establishment as the food was wonderful and the service will continue to get better...hopefully."}
{"text":"Turtle Jack's is a restaurant that places heavy emphasis on presentation. Visually, everything from the interior decor to the plating is well done. 

Ordered the Bison Meatloaf. It was a ground chuck wrapped in bacon and set on a bed of mashed potatoes. The dish also came topped with onion straws and was accompanied by some seasonal vegetables. I'd say it took a little long for the food to arrive but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because we were seated at a large table. 

I felt the meatloaf could've been a little more firm. The bacon wrap was soggy and didn't give the texture contrast I was expecting. I guess the crispy onion straws were supposed to add all the crisp and crunch to the dish? Those were good. The mashed potatoes, gravy, and vegetables were all well done but nothing special. 

Service at this restaurant was alright... It wasn't notably speedy, but it also never seemed to be absent. One thing that bothered me was how they closed the patio down prematurely when clouds started to set in. It was never really supposed to rain and would've been a great patio day, but because their patio lacked a roof, they had already removed all the cushioning and halted outdoor service. Oh well. 

You should know what you're expecting when you walk into a chain restaurant such as TJs. Food should be passable, somewhat decent drink menu, and a good place to hang out. It's best quality is that its a really nice looking place, but it could be so much more."}
{"text":"This place is really a hit or miss. Over priced like most franchises. 

When the food is good it's good but when it's bad it awful. The cheaper items not worth trying stick with meat items like steak, ribs and wings. 

Deserts are all the same brownie after Brownie after brownie."}
{"text":"Cold food. Watery drinks. Very dark...could not read menu."}
{"text":"Going out one normally has a general idea of how the night will work out. Not this night. First we ordered a burger with upgraded sweet potato fries, but got normal fries. Our burgers were cooked medium well ( without requesting such ). A nearby clumsy waitress seemly \"dropped\" a glass so hard that dangerous glass fragments ended up in my hair and hitting my friend's leg!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty good meal at Turtle Jacks two nights ago.
My niece loves the place and this is the first time I've visited this location since they became somewhat more upscale.  Besides her and I, I'm not sure the rest of the family likes it.
My sister in law and I shared the Valentine's Special which was an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a butter tart for $50.
We had the cheese dip, I had the 4 cheese pasta, she had the steak.
My pasta was cheesy, fatty, and delicious. It reminded me of the chicken pasta at the Pickle Barrel. The dip was delicious, even the kids ate it.
My dad who also ordered the steak said it was really tough.
I tried some of the blackened basa (also on the 2 for $50 menu) and it was quite tasty but pretty small.
The butter tart looked like a giant cork. It was hard, but boy was it good!
I'm not a fan of butter tarts but I liked this one.
It is served with ice cream.
I think their food is a tad overpriced but it's tasty and I like it.
Our server wasn't too attentive, our glasses were only filled when we asked and it took a while for her to come back around before we could order a second pitcher.
The manager was extremely friendly and good with kids.
I had an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"Turtle Jacks has fantastic wings!  You can choose breaded or not, and all kinds of other options.  I don't really think choosing the non-breaded wings make them much healthier for you...but who am I to say?

Atmosphere is generic, same as so many of those types of Montana's, Kelsey's, whatever...you can find much better restaurants, but when you want to go out for beer and wings, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? This was my first time visiting Turtle Jacks, so I went with an open mind. I was attending for a Birthday Dinner.  There were around 40 people attending the dinner. We were placed in a section to ourselves but was not realistic as it was extremely hard for people to pass through the small isle. The server came over, didn't introduce herself and started off by taking drink orders. She couldn't make it through the isle so she had to yell to each individual to place their drink and food order. I found it weird that she didn't tell us her name, promo's, suggestions for menu items- nothing and that she was the only one serving such a large group (around 40). We were waiting a little over an hour and a half just to get our order. The server came back and announced that for everyone who ordered Salmon- its sold out. We had to keep on asking for refills and had to remind her several times that we requested refills. Finally, the food came out and I was even more disappointed! I got my dinner and the ribs were burnt (black), the salad was saggy and I asked for NO croutons and got soft croutons!  I was surprised that the chef actually sent that out. My boyfriend ordered a steak dinner- medium well and it was overly well done (no trace of pink- just brown) and very dry! We sent the food back to the kitchen only for the server to come back and say, they are sold out of ribs for the night and if I wanted to order something else. At that point I told the server no, only because it was already late and we waited long enough for our dinners to come out.  There was another gentle man at my table who also ordered steak and it was not medium rare as he ordered. Then my daughter said ewww Mommy, there's hair in my food! At that point I was upset because not only did we wait so long for our orders, it was burnt, saggy, dry and now HAIR!? The server came back and said she could hardly see the hair, then when we showed her and she herself said eww and took back the plate. She came out and said she feels really bad and asked me if I wanted free dessert- I told her no thank you. Then a child sitting at my table asked if they sold brownies-  server said yes, and the child asked to order that but to please make sure there was no hair in the brownie. The server then came back with the brownie and ice cream and told the child not too worry as she put EXTRA hair in it for her. I'm sorry but I DO NOT find that funny at all, neither did anyone at the table. I never ever experienced something like this at a restaurant before and I never ever want to. I would rate this experience a -10 out of 10."}
{"text":"3.5

Slow service
Waitress spilled my Guiness on me
She was cute but she was talking with her hands.....it was bound to happen and i knew it!!!!! i purposely moved my Guinness so she would not knock it and took a sip, stupidly i put the drink back...2 secs later BAM LOL she was cute though so she was lucky but we never got cutlery to eat our goat cheese app, it took her awhile to take our order.  Once we ordered we got the food in good time.
the wings were tasty but there's no wing night there??? hello!! 

all in all not bad, i would go for the wings again."}
{"text":"Had the blackened basa tacos. They weren't kidding. They really were blackened (as in burned beyond recognition). No point going out for dinner if you can cook a simple piece of fish better than a line cook."}
{"text":"I went to Turtle Jack's for a fairly late lunch. And, perhaps it was late, the main chef was not there. I ordered a ribs and wings with a glass of Mondavi Carbernet Merlot. The wine will never go wrong....

So, here's the download: 
I asked for dusted cajun wings and while it looked large, the wings were lite in flavor leaning towards bland. 

The half rack of ribs came with honey garlic sauce. While it did easily come out of the bones, you know the ribs were cooked by boiling. There was not enough sauce and taste. In fact, there was no taste where there was no sauce. The sauce was sparingly applied, so one cant taste the honey nor garlic taste. 

The coleslaw followed the same theme. It was neither the creamy kind nor the vinegary. There was no taste to it. 

Quite disappointing and should've gone to Fratecelli's next door instead!"}
{"text":"We come here fairly often and haven't had any complaints so far, food is always good, service good. All the desserts are fabulous."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group deal voucher.  It was fully packed on a Friday night, with a 30 mins. waiting time when I went. 

Ordered the rib & wing combo, which comes with the option of 2 sides (baked potatoes, fries, mashed potatoes, soup, salad): ($23.99)

The ribs: Baton Rouge sauce (Cajun & Honey Mustard)
Wings: Original signature NY butter sauce
Mashed potatoes
French onion  soup

I love the fact that you can customize your wings the way you like them. With the options of Roasters (Larger wings) and Fryers (Smaller, classic style) and the amount of sauce you want applied on it. The NY butter sauce was amazing. Definitely a must try.

French onion soup was good, though it was a huge slice of mozerrella cheese on top, which was tough to eat through. 

The ribs were fall off the bone goodness. I enjoyed the flavouring too. 

For dessert, I tried the deep fried cheesecake with whipped cream ($5.99). Honestly, it tasted like a FBI (Fried banana w/ icecream), but worse. 

I would definitely come back, especially for the wings."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and overall I think it's a quality joint, for what it is.
I'm sometimes wary of chain gastro pubs with huge menus that touch on every type of food, but everything I've had here has been pretty great, for pub grub.

Salads, nachos, burgers, and especially their fish dishes were all really good. Their blackened chicken on naan is a favorite of mine, make sure to check it out.

I like that it's rarely busy here, you can always grab a table with ease and not have it be super loud. It's also great for kids.

The service is EXTREMELY friendly but often pretty slow and inattentive, and the prices are a bit steep for this kind of place in my opinion but other than that, I really like Turtle Jack's."}
{"text":"Decor is impressive at this Turtle Jack's location. Tonight the service was a little slow as it seems our table was being served by the person also manning the bar. Price are a touch on the high side but the quality of the food is quite good.

New York Butter is the topping to try on your wings. Dry Cajun is also good."}
{"text":"Had seen various locations and was interested in checking it out. Went to this location few months back. It wasnt bad but I did not find it worth spending money eating out on. Actually had high expectations but have to say it failed to deliver.  Food in general did not have much taste, very plain. Forgot what I had for main but also ordered wings. Wasn't bad but  i found the sizes seemed smaller than most place. I will not be returning to Turtle Jacks."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend and I must say that the bison burger was delicious! Will definitely go back for the food and the nice set up this restaurant has!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants on Brampton. Awesome food and atmosphere.  The Big Bang shrimp is spectacular and the wings, blackened basa or fish tacos are our favorites.   Best family restaurant with friendly staff and amenities.  Always look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The first time I was at this location I was quite surprised. It wasn't like the other Turtle Jack's i've been to. You are welcomed by attractive hostesses in short dresses opening the front door for you which makes you think... am I in Moxie's? Once inside, you are surrounded by nice decor in a dim, warm atmosphere which is quite different from the Vaughn location i've been to. They have a separate side for lounge/bar area as well. 

On to the food. I got two words.... FRIED PICKLES!! They are the BEST here and i've tried many fried pickles. Only downside is, the fried pickles alone cost more than their dessert menu at $8.99 and you only get one huge pickle cut into 6. Well worth it in my opinion though. 

So what is Turtle Jack's knowned for other than fried pickles? I would have to say their wings... crispy, saucy and meaty. Their ribs and steaks are good as well although I wouldn't say it's the best.  Their dessert menu contains a wide variety of chocolaty items but I would recommend the deep fried cheesecake. It's cheesecake filling wrapped in small crepes and fried. Delicious! 

As for the service. Their service is good and the waiters make sure that you are happy with your meal. Although the first time I went to this location, the waiter we had was very very annoying. It is good for a waiter to ask how's the food but to ask that question 10 times while we were there... irritating. Not to hate on the guy but if the food was great the first time you ask, why the hec would you ask the same question 2min later and 2min later after that one?! The worse is, he'll interrupt your conversation with your friends just to ask how the food is doing. Fortunately, I did not see that waiter the second time I went back... which probably means he's fired for being the most annoying waiter in the world. 

Would I recommend this place? Without a doubt! Although it does seem that certain waiters are still in training and lacks knowledge of menu items but they make up for that with the fried pickles except for that annoying waiter I had... nothing can make up for that."}
{"text":"First and last visit here. Wings were blah and greasy and service was non existent. When I saw how empty it was I should have left. There's obviously a reason it was empty."}
{"text":"Never coming back. We came last week with some family. Food was not good. My vegetables were very limited on my main entree.

Also, I was not offered a complimentary drink after  it was served to me with a fly in my Chardonnay. If you don't offer me a free drink after that, I am Never coming back. Good bye."}
{"text":"Fish and chips at the bar after a long day was hot, fresh and tasty. Glad I stopped on an impulse..."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Our waitress was very nice; she answered questions, gave recommendations, and was very nice. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"It's a pretty good alternative when stuck staying around the airport. The atmosphere is like a sports bar, but a little more upscale. I had the Southwest chicken salad and it was good, not great. Could of used a little more seasoning or spice. The servers were very friendly and the service was great. My meal was pricey for what I got.  A little over $50 Canadian for a salad, cheese dip appetizer and a soda. Still better than fast food or Subway across the street!"}
{"text":"I wish these were in Michigan. Loved the poutine. One of my favorites i had. The honey garlic chicken strips tastes like a sesame chicken from a chinese place. Which i love. Came for lunch with my boss and had a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Gave this funky franchise name a try during a late happy hour / dinner. Venue is inviting and staff apparently handpicked out of the same basket... At first the menu is appealing and kinda everywhere but shamefully they managed to kill the fish taco here. Maybe wings or sandwiches would have been a safer bet but given the bison meatloaf isn't anywhere near a burger my venture for the loyalty club may stop here."}
{"text":"A nice enough place... the moejito  was really watered down. I had the pad Thai,  not their signature dish, but I was not too hungry. It was OK, It just didn't have much heat or peanutty taste as I expected. The sauce was also way too sweet for me.  The other fellows at our table had the ribs, a burger, a silrloin steak and fish and chips and everyone was happy saying it was good.  The burger was visually stunning as it was a tower of food. If it was up to me I wouldn't come here often, but I did find it OK. 3 generous stars."}
{"text":"fast and nice service i believe we were served by the manager or someone with higher power cuz he did not have a standard uniform. he was super friendly and nice, we ordered nachos with chicken and they were absolutely delicious, and the seasoning was fantastic! definetely the   best restaurant in the meadowvale area, been there a lot of times and will be definetely going back!!!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Turtle Jacks before this visit, but when one opened up around the corner from one of my friends we decided to check it out. The interior was nice and warm, a little dim even in the bar but it gave you a nice sense of privacy. The staff were all attentive and friendly and provided some good advice for our selections. 

I ordered fish and chips, they came a little greasy fries were a little over done. But still pretty good, all things considered, and I'd give them another try in the future. But probably not until I tried a few other things off of the pretty diverse and unique menu."}
{"text":"Came here with my sisters and kids. Service took awhile (bout 30min) but it was 8 of us.. so maybe the kitche wasnt prepared. Food was good. Servers were kind. THE Parmigan was just alright..portions were a fairly small compared to the price. Flavour for the chicken wings were good. JUST servixe was a bit slow that sunday. Staff was kind. Food was alright overall..ive attached pics to help. My sister ats the tacos and said she was still hungry lol i mean i think its good if ur not so hungry. But want a light meal."}
{"text":"Nothing like Muskoka. Bad service too... You're better off driving down to Highway 7 and Weston Rd where the good restaurants are at!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty much a regular at the Turtle Jacks Vogell location. That's the go to spot for the Crew. Central location to catch NBA games. The service is excellent, couldn't be happier with the waitresses at Turtle Jacks. Food is pretty good and decent in portion sizes. My only and biggest complaint is the drink specials menu. They are awful!! Especially for Fridays and Saturdays. Who wants Long Island iced teas to watch sports games?? Like common...you can do better. I almost feel bad for your servers who are probably having hard time selling those kind of specials. Business would increase drastically if u had better drink specials. Believe me!! @TurtleJacks @TurtleJacksVrd #TurtleJacks #AwfulSpecials #TerribleDailyDrinks Take advise from valued customers, Jimstar out!!"}
{"text":"Good place for casual dining and comfort food.
I really like the set up which is inviting and warm and slightly nicer than say your Boston Pizza or Kelsey's.
Food wise I would recommend the bison meatloaf! Very nicely done."}
{"text":"Went there with a large group to celebrate a co-workers retirement. They were ready for us at the time of our reservation as guests started trickling in.

Our server was really good at managing the group, taking our orders, and keeping it all organized.

The food was good, above average, but maybe not outstanding. Presentation was nice.

I would go back."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night with a few friends (group of 10 or so).  I was really disappointed with the service because our waitress rarely came to check on us.  I think she only came by twice to see if wanted to have drinks/order during the whole hour.  I was thoroughly disappointed.

The food wasn't bad - I had the classic burger.  It was pretty good.  The soup isn't bad either (cream of broccoli).  However, my friends who had ordered wings said that they were good but overpriced.  Sides were also over-priced and VERY small.  

Not only this, one of my friends (who always seems to get the bad luck) had her order missed.  

We weren't impressed."}
{"text":"First time there we got burgers, they were burnt.  We gave them a second chance and went a second time, service was great, food was mediocre.  Went a third time, food was terrible, my drink was mixed wrong and when I complained the server didn't know what I was talking about when I told him it was missing the lemonade.  The server was then rude to us the rest of the time, ignored us and then stored off when he saw that we gave him little to no tip.  Can't say I'll be going there again other than for the \"Midnight Paddle\" drink but even then never going to this one ever again."}
{"text":"The worst service I have experienced!  My rating is actually zero for this restaurant.  Came to watch a game and found a nice booth.  The table was not cleaned yet so we were standing and waiting.  There were around six or so staff in the bar but no one was coming by to ask to help! 

We had to wave someone down to clean the table - she picked up the dishes and then disappeared without wiping it. We reminded bar staff we were still waiting- then she returned to wipe it.  Took over10 minutes to be seated at a clean table!   Took another 10 minutes for waitress to come back to take our order. Service matters and acknowledging your customers in a timely manner is a must!  Terrible experience."}
{"text":"I do like the food at Turtle Jack's. However, I haven't frequented this location for anything but drinks. The bar area is nice and rustic, really good for a winter-time date. 

I ordered my usual margarita. Here goes:

Margarita Rating: 5/5
They didn't serve it in a proper margarita glass, or even a cocktail glass; and they put ice in it. This is never the usual way to serve a margarita. But taste-wise? Top-notch! 

Can't wait to go back for food."}
{"text":"@TURTLEJACKS #YELPGTA #TURTLEJACKS #BISONTORONTO

1. I don't really get the hype about Turtle Jacks. To people who go \"OMG... so much better than Jack Astors... so much better than Moxies\" - please chill, this is just another chain restaurant, commonly believed to be \"more expensive\" but around the same price range of its competitors. 

2. The margaritas here are darned good. 

3. I was not a fan that they changed their dimly lit interiors for dinner to full on light. My last dinner here was way more romantic. 

4. The food is pretty decent - I had the bison meatloaf. I still root for the meatloaf at Pickle Barrel. My friend had the chicken strips; it's a winner. I have never seen any other place serve more than 3 strips or have a choice of a variety of sauces. 

5. Server was overattentive... I guess that's a good thing. 

3.5/5"}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this restaurant 5 1/2 weeks ago, turned out it had opened just the night before on the Wednesday!  They had so many staff (training I guess) that it felt like we had walked into a wedding banquet and there were servers everywhere!  We were welcomed immediately by 2 hostesses, as they even opened the door for us.

The decor was great.  Apparently this is their flagship restaurant so the decor and menu items are more \"up-scale\".

The staff were very pleasant and attentive.  Some of them you could tell were new and a bit nervous, but they had that \"eagerness\" about them that was refreshing. Too often the \"veteran\" servers perform their job like robots, not here.  They were all out to impress, which was...impressive.  Even the manager came by 2 times to greet us personally.

The food was very tasty...maybe even too tasty!  Our first foray into their menu was the bison meatloaf and the turkey/brie/pear sandwich.  Both were excellent!

Since then, I have gone back 3 more times, so yes, that's once a week for 4 weeks straight.  Always on Thursdays to get $3.50 MGDs!  I missed last week, but am going again this week....so 5 out of 6 weeks isn't too bad!

Other menu items we've tried is the blackened sea bass (a bit too salty, but tasty.  I would suggest ordering it lightly seasoned), the wings and the roasters (choose the roasters, much more juicy, get the extra butter one, slightly grilled), the caesar salad, French onion soup,a bunch of appetizers, and almost all the desserts.  Definitely save room for dessert!!!  I can't remember what they are called now, but they are big, and very reasonably priced.

The washrooms are the cleanest of any restaurant I've been to, and the bar area is nice and roomy,  with a big bar and huge TVs.

One last comment about the decor, their servers and hostesses seem to be of the \"attractive\" variety...much like a Moxies.  

A must-try restaurant which is unique, with lots of menu choices, friendly servers, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, it was pretty quiet when we went. The calamari was great, my burger was alright but nothing special. My gf had the basa which was pretty good. This is a good place if you want something a bit more quiet than your regular Montana's or Jack Astors from what I saw, then again there wasn't a game on when I went.

I would go back for the calamari but their main dishes are nothing above average."}
{"text":"Our dining experience was middle of the road.  We ordered fish and chips and a pot roast sandwich.  Both were rather well made and tasted decent.  For the price, the sandwich was small in portion, yet it was sufficient to fill my BF up.  The batter of the fried fish was good.  It was crunchy and not too oily.  The Haddock was bland though.  Services on a Thursday evening was adequate.

Turtle Jack's attempts to deliver a notch up over Montana. Food, decoration, atmosphere, services."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. Quick, knowledgeable and nice. The bison burger was delicious, cooked to perfection. The desserts where massive, be prepared to share even though you might not want to because of how tasty they where. The fire and ice was delicious. The kids menus where very creative and entertaining."}
{"text":"Got the bacon cheddar burger. I was so disappointed as the burger meat was dry and not really seasoned. The bun was stale. I think it may have been frozen and thawed out.
My friend had the goat cheese salad, which sounded awesome, but was also a dissapointment. Many of her lettuce leaves were browning.

On a positive note...their sweet potato fries were good and so was the Spicey sauce that went with them. Not worth going back for though."}
{"text":"Honestly, the restaurant was nice. A pity that's not the only thing we look at.

Pros
- I don't think they charged us extra for plates & knives (for cake cutting); I honestly can't believe that some restaurants do that...
- Their lobster mashed potatoes are amazing. But don't get it unless you're getting a steak (it goes from $2.99 as a side for steak... to $7.99 to a side with any other entree) 
- The pot roast sandwich is yummy 

Cons
- My friend ordered beers many times which only each came to us half an hour later. Seriously? Do you cook your beer? What takes so long? 
- Towards the end of the night, our waitress started to get snappy and seemed a bit rude; granted, we stayed 3 hours but we were drinking/eating throughout the entire time
- I ordered the lobster mashed potatoes which is a side; I asked if I could order it without getting a steak (the potatoes were priced at $2.99). The waitress said it was okay and somehow managed to charge me $7.99... excuse me? 
- Don't get the four cheese pasta (which is supposedly a turtle jacks favorite)

Honestly, the food was amazing. But the service was absolutely horrible. Sadly, the overall experience was poor as a result."}
{"text":"Turtle Jack's is a Milestones/Montanas/Moxies etc. type chain. We had never been here before but decided to try it out as the menu looked pretty yummy.

We found the service to be a bit slow & kind of pushy?

Had the deep fried pickles to the start. I love me some deep fried pickles. I was impatient and ate mine before it was cool so I may or may not have burned my mouth a little, woops :).They were decent, not the best I've had but certainly not the worst. They came with ranch dip that I don't think is house made and likely came from a kraft bottle.

I snagged a bite from my boyfriends \"Big Kahuna\" burger: burger brushed with jerk sauce, & topped with havarti, a grilled pineapple, and mayo. It was kind of meh - the jerk sauce not too noticible and the pineapple didn't seem grilled very long.

I had the chicken quesadillas which were severely lacking in the chicken department (mostly filled with tomato & green onion.) Also no option for guac. Womp womp. I would not order this again.

Overall, the visit was a bit lackluster. I hear good things about the wings though, so we may give Turtle Jacks a second chance!"}
{"text":"Stopped in one night for a quick drink. It was really busy and had a good vibe. I sat at the bar and didn't stay long but it seemed ok. One day ill try having a meal and see how that goes."}
{"text":"Decent place, though a tad on the pricier side for the quantity your getting. 

Pretty standard fair though the menu is as small as the portions they give.

I would come here again, as it's a convenient location, service was quick and friendly and is pretty spacious, but i would never personally suggest coming here. 

Not the best, not the worse but definitely has room for improvement"}
{"text":"Atmosphere:
We came here with a big group of friends after badminton exercise.  The atmosphere here is great with good lighting and friendly waitresses.  They have  lots of TV with live sport broadcast and music.  There are many seats available that can handle large volume of customers.  People who like to watch live sport while drinking cocktail and beer will be very please.

Food:
We order many drinks and appetizers because appetizers is half price after 9pm.  The appetizers are good.  The wings are crispy with good amount of seasoning and not too oily.  The chicken quesadilla is fresh and tasty but not enough cheese.  Thr Guacamole and chips is very fresh.  It was a surprise to us that the food portion is very generous even though it is half price.  We order many cocktail drinks such as: 

Arnold Palmer
Raspberry Lemonade
Raspberry Mojito

Service:
Maybe because we have a large group, I find the service was a bit slow.  We waited over 15 minutes before the waitress came to ask us what we want.

Overall, the restaurant is good and I will come again."}
{"text":"I've visited this location with a large group of colleagues twice. The first time was back in November 2017 when they first opened up. The burger I ordered was actually really good. The second visit was around Christmas 2017. That time they were more organized, but the food wasn't anything special. Our group complained about the overcooked burgers, soggy quesadillas and flavourless salad and it's not that cheap either."}
{"text":"Decided to pop into this place for some drinks with a few girlfriends. It just happened to be the nearest restaurant to where we were but I definitely wouldn't have chosen this place if I had not been out on a whim.

Place is average looking in its decor.. serves its purpose as a bar/grill type of restaurant. Like I said we were there for drinks and just that.

Our server (Kaylene) was very pleasant with smiles to spare. She was very helpful with any questions we had pertaining to alcoholic beverages and to the menu.

My beverage of choice is cranberry orange with two shots of vodka. It was just okay.. but I'm used to that.. the only place that makes this drink tasty is the keg mansion downtown T.O. Anyways, as the night went on I started to feel a little peckish so I decided to order an appetizer.

I decided to go with the guacamole and chips. I was really disappointed with it but then again I require a lot of flavour in my dishes and it was just way too bland.

I was looking for the chips to be hot and fresh but they weren't. I tried adding some salt and pepper and it just wasn't working so I did not eat it.

I understand that they need to make it bland because that's the way they have to make it or then people will complain that it's too spicy.

My friend ordered the Bruschetta and didn't like it either. She complained that it was too dry and lacked in flavour as well. She says their seemed to be cucumbers In it.. odd

My two other friends ordered these mocha coffee type drinks though and said they were delicious! So to each is own.

I gave this place a 4 stars mainly because of the excellent customer service we received from our waitress. She was friendly, upbeat and always checking on us every 15 minutes. She never once made us feel like we had to leave.

As far as the food, if you are someone who tends to enjoy your food on the less flavour less/blandness type you will have no problem coming here."}
{"text":"Terrible, slow service. Dirty patio with napkins, receipts and even food on the ground. Not at all what I was expecting...will not go back"}
{"text":"Its lobster season and it seems like everyone has lobster specials on the menu.

Lobster grilled cheese sandwich $16.99 - when it arrived I said to myself  \"where's the rest of it?\" The sandwich was tiny, the coleslaw was even smaller and the lobster meat was mashed into pieces and very limited in portion. The week before I had a lobster grilled cheese sandwich at Jake's on Main and everything there was huge. It was a triple-decker sandwich with big chucks of lobster and a huge serving of fries or salad for $14.99. At Turtle Jack's I was really disappointed with the lobster grilled cheese sandwich because Jake's set the bar way too high but it tasted okay at least.

Lobster salad $16.99 - you can actually see lobster in this dish but nothing really to point out.

Service was friendly and relatively quick."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but maybe overpriced a bit. The portions are okay. I got the Chicken Parmesan with Alfredo pasta. It was really good though, i wouldn't mind having some right now actually. 

Our server was really nice and attentive, but not overly attentive. She kept checking on us for refills or if anything else was needed. Overall my part of the bill came around to $23 plus tip, which is okay. I got stuffed so that's important. I would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent experience both times I have dined here with family. 

Our server was Amanda both times and she remembered us too. She was very friendly and answered any questions we had about the menu. She checked up on us and made sure everything was good throughout the whole meal. 

Ordered the Chicken Avocado Tacos with the Mac and Cheese. This is second time I've had the Mac and Cheese, it's delicious and baked to perfection. The tacos were good but would have liked the option of soft or hard tacos. 

Previously I've ordered the Bison Burger and it's an amazing burger. It is fairly priced as the patty is made out of bison, chuck, bacon and mixed with mushroom. It had good flavours and it was juicy not dry; it was the perfect combination. I would come back to eat this again. 

Overall, I had a wonderful experience each time both in service and the quality of food they have here. It's become one of my go to places. They also have daily drink specials so check the menu for that!"}
{"text":"First impression? It was a mix of Montana's, Moxie's and Jack Astors. Typical restaurant filled with large television screens. 

The menu for food and drinks were typical and overpriced (the cocktails especially). The servers did not even approach us when we walked in but fortunately we only waited 10 minutes for a table. There were drink specials but none that really appealed to me. 

Pitcher of Domestic Beer ($19.99), and here I thought Boston Pizza was expensive. Think again, this place really knows how to overcharge. 

Thai Salad ($15.99), was pretty good but made request for preference changes and the kitchen had not followed the instructions. So had to wait even longer for the salad. But seriously, $15.99 for a salad that tasted average, I am not impressed.

Buffalo Chicken Wrap ($13.99), which came with fries (mind you, I thought the fries were pretty good here!). I enjoyed the wrap but thought they put too much sauce in the wrap, like most places but it tasted pretty decent. 

The Classic ($13.99), which is a typical burger, my sister enjoyed it very much but there was nothing different or unique about the burger. 

Most of the night's conversation concluded with the fries being the best part of the meal unfortunately. The service was also not impressive, she was really nice but felt she was slow in service.Would I come back? I'd have to think twice about it."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here today and was very pleasantly surprised! 3 of ordered the fish tacos and two others in my group ordered blackened chicken salad! Food was flavorful and excellent! 

Big downside is absolutely no parking at lunchtime as too many businesses in this plaza!"}
{"text":"Second visit and the burger with cheese and bacon wasn't as good as I remembered. The burger was pretty charred, cheese was barely detected , burger wasn't seasoned enough, thin onion rings on top was bland and breading was falling off. Fries were also overly salted. I don't know if they switched chefs or if its just an off night but drastic difference from first visit."}
{"text":"They are known for their wings and rightfully so.  They are big unlike tiny wings at other establishments.  It is worth the visit just for the wings and of course beer.

Service was great, very attentive and helpful with a smile.  Heather was fantastic and had great suggestions.  You can get a free appetizer if you complete a survey, it is a little bit long but hey, free appetizer is worth it.  Just show the confirmation to your server so they remove the cost from your bill.

I had the avacado chicken tacos, not bad came with fries and gravy.  The wings of course we're way better.

Overall pleasant place though it was a bit loud, food was good and filling.  Next time coming up to the north I will make a stop for the wings for sure."}
{"text":"Visited twice before forming an opinion.  The 2nd time they were out of children's menus but printed off paper copies to not disappoint.  Aside from that hiccup, the food has always been great and the selection plenty.  I really love their kids menu as a cost friendly alternative to the McD's out there.  The food is great!"}
{"text":"Honestly, wasn't impressed. The burger was alright but the fries were not good at all. Won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"This was a decent restaurant. Pretty busy since it was a Wednesday nite. 

The food was only decent. I had a house mixed salad with their house speciality...wings. They were very hot in temp when I got them. The flavour was non-descript. I asked for the wings to be \"doused\" with medium Buffalo sauce & they were almost dry. Not a big deal but irritating nonetheless. Beer was good & cold however."}
{"text":"Way overpriced! $20.00 for nachos extra if you want meat or guacamole?!?! You're kidding me right?! Are you using a special imported cheese I'm unaware of?Average food, dry burgers, so so wings, dry pasta nothing special for the cost. I would never consider ordering an entree priced over $20 from this place. No ambience, no vibe. Same as usual pedestrian items on the menu. Seems like
Management changes frequently?service is
pleasant and courteous but waitresses now wear casual clothing so it's hard to tell who is working because it looks like hey rolled in to pick up their charger? We live in the neighbourhood and now avoid this place because it just not worth it. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Under the new management, the place has undergone a bit of an update. It's become a little bit more open and with large-screen TVs all around.

We were with a group of about 20 for a holiday party. The staff too very good care of us. Ben, one of the new owner came to greet us a few times and to make sure we were having a good time (which we did). 

The fireplace was blazing hot, the Leafs game was on and I could see from different angles on 3 different TVs. The food was good too. I had the fish tacos (okay) and my mrs had the blackened chicken salad with goat cheese (very good). One of the new things there is the coffee they serve, which is another nice upgrade they have made. 

One of the guy's in out party order got mixed up so Ben the owner came over and us a free desert, which a super reach and almost gooey brownie smothered in caramel and topped with ice cream and whipped cream."}
{"text":"Have tried really hard to like this place. Three visits, three bad experiences.  Cold food, poor service, incredibly long waits, and most of the food was mediocre. When we asked for our food to be reheated (didn't ask for a re-order) the waitress took offence. For those prices the food should at least be warm but it was cold! 

I will say the one shining star is their calamari. Came out hot two (out of three) times and is flavourful and not greasy. 

All that said, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The menu is interesting and has a good selection.  My partner chose the house burger which was very very good - it tasted like the meat was freshly ground from a sirloin - good taste, fresh and the grilled pineapple was a nice variance for a topping.  I had the blackened basa fish tacos.  Meh, nothing to write home about (my partner makes far better ones) but the fish was delicious which is what I ate all of.  The taco's were too dry and hard - I like mine warm but soft, not crunchy and the slaw filling/dressing was not very good.  Too mushy yet no distinct flavours came through.  We declined on dessert because of eating restrictions until the Holiday Season but nothing on the dessert menu was really wowing us anyway.

Overall, the food is a hit and miss depending on what you order, the dessert menu is limited and not really to our liking but others may find it fantastic.

Service was really good...our server was very friendly, polite and checked on us a couple of times...very efficient.  The atmosphere was quiet while we were there but I'm glad we left before the big crowd (with kids) came in that they set tables up for right beside our booth.  (Main reason I hate family dining places...I dislike having loud/screamy/whiny kids ruin our eating experiences - there really should be more ADULT ONLY eating venues.)"}
{"text":"I've never been here before, but it was surprisingly good!

Came here for a team dinner, prices are higher price point.
I tried the - hell of a burger for $16.99

It was a good burger.

Service was good.

{"text":"You're eating up in Muskoka somewhere.  No, you're not.  You're eating at a chain restaurant made to look like a cottage.  If that's true, why are the servers dressed all in black with short skirts?  They should be wearin' plaid or something.

Now onto the review...

It's OK.  Just like how the dÃ©cor isn't related to the uniform, the food doesn't really scream COTTAGE.  In fact, I'm sure a good majority of it is similar to Jack Astor's, Shoeless Joe's, Milestones, etc.  Menu-wise, it's pretty standard, nothing stands out.  There's burgers, wings, fajitas, blah, blah, blah.

I ordered Basa Fish Tacos ($12.99).  Wished that it was a better kind of fish, but it was the cheapest and blackened as opposed to battered.  There was too much stuff going on top:  lettuce, guac, pineapple salsa, and some sauce.  It came with a HUGE side of your choice (soup/salad/fries, etc.), but they weren't listed on the menu.

My meal was ok.  I was full after the 2 tacos, didn't touch my salad.  Apparently the Blackened Basa was really good with garlic mashed potatoes underneath.  Calamari was just standard.  Fish 'n Chips looked a bit greasy, especially fries since they were underneath the piece of fish.

Nothing super memorable and nothing I'd go back running to."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location yesterday for New Year's day for our first lunch date of 2016. This restaurant was just as good as the Clarkson location. They weren't very busy yesterday since it was a holiday so we pretty much had the place to ourselves, besides the group of people who were hanging out in the bar area. I was immediately greeted by a friendly face upon entering and she gave us the choice of either sitting at the bar area or in the dining room. I opted for the dining room as it was more quiet and my husband and I are very introverted. 

The menu selection was only one page so I wasn't overwhelmed with a long list of items to choose from.  We ordered and shared the calamari appetizer, which came with white sauce (don't know the name but it had a nice flavor) and cocktail sauce and it was the best calamari I've had in a while. Usually, other restaurant calamari is very rubbery but this one melted in your mouth. For my main, I ordered the fish avocado tacos with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy and the presentation looked nice when it came out. The mashed potatoes and gravy tasted fresh too and I pretty much cleaned that out quickly. I was a little disappointed with the tacos though. They tasted good and had a nice flavor but it was a little on the dry side and I think it was because I asked to have the pico sauce on the side since it had jalapeÃ±os and I'm not a fan of spicy food. However, I still took the second taco home and I'll eat it for breakfast today and add some of my own seasonings. 

Our server was pleasant and she checked on us regularly and at the right times and I like how she asked about any food allergies that they should be aware of. I'm allergic to mangoes and I usually would have to take the initiative myself to tell people that.  Also, the restaurant manager came out once to check on us personally to see how we were liking the food. 

What prevented me from giving the perfect 5-stars was the price, which I think was a bit high for a casual restaurant setting with pub style menu items and the tacos as I tasted more meat and barely any avocado. However, this didn't really ruin our overall experience and we would definitely come back here whenever we're looking for a good sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"Had wings with the hotter than hot sauce and baked onion soup.   I asked for the soup before my wings.  Needless to say that didn't happen.  I can't stand getting my soup when my entree comes.  Service was a tad slow as well."}
{"text":"Solid 1 out of 5.  1.5 hour wait and one person gets missed all together, no apology and manager nowhere to be found. Got taken for $140 ride !!!!"}
{"text":"So I'm pretty ambivalent about this place.
I've been here twice this past month and got my entire meal paid for on both times because the restaurant messed up. Therefore, I'm not complaining about getting free food but c'mon people, get on top of things!
A couple weeks ago our entire family went there for dinner, everybody got what they ordered except for me and my uncle who received our veggie burgers completely burnt. We sent them back and didn't get them until the rest of our party finished eating. They said it would take about 7 minutes to cook but in reality, got them after about 20 minutes. When we complained, the manager was very nice and apologetic and said we wouldn't have to pay for what we ordered. So that was nice.

Because they did that, we gave them another chance. My sister and I called in to order for pickup tonight. We ordered the veggie burger once more and a Thai salad. Lady said it would take 15 minutes. We got there after 20 minutes and had to wait another 30 minutes before we got our food for pickup. Why this happened is beyond me.... but it was very annoying. They paid for our entire meal once more.

So like I said, they did deal with the situation in an effective way, but still... Having that happen twice in one month kind of makes you wonder about the way this place is run."}
{"text":"Some good things on their menu but most doesn't entice me. Everything I've tried has plenty of flavour though."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. We ordered 2 kids meals, grilled cheese and chicken fingers, the portions were tiny. My two year was still hungry after her meal. There was no dessert included, you get a little bag of gummies. We also got a burgers, fries were not included, which is surprising, the burger alone is $16. Overall, average food, but way overpriced. You are better off driving east on Rutherford and head towards the Vaughan mill plaza, more options and better quality restaurants available."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today with a colleague and a client.

Our server spoke really really really really really really fast and low and we had to keep asking her to repeat what she was saying.  You'd think after we asked her a couple times to repeat herself that she'd slow down.

I had the chicken parm again.  It was okay.  The Alfred pasta was good.  The chicken was a bit small and a bit burnt on the bottom and there was a lot of cheese on top.  I think I'll order something else if I go there again."}
{"text":"Turtle Jacks casual dining. Nothing to go wow! About.  Service was good, our waitress was friendly and fast. We ordered French onion soup. In my opinion, I've had better, was too salty and not enough cheese. My husband and I shared a stir fry, again too much sauce, mostly noodles and very little protein and vegetables.  I shouldn't complain I had a night off from cooking."}
{"text":"Whoah, Turtle Jack's has changed. I used to think it was just a place for wings and beer but they have totally classed it up.

I came here for drinks and food for my coworker's last lunch with us. I found that the prices were a little steep ($16-$17 for a burger and $18.50 for a domestic pitcher). The server and hostess were friendly but a little slow, we knew this ahead of time though and asked for our food to go.

I ordered a veggie burger with havarti cheese and hot peppers. My friends got the goat cheese appetizer ($16), a gluten free veggie burger, and a salad.

The amount of goat cheese that came in the appetizer was disgustingly small and horrendously overpriced, steer clear of that one. The salad (from the looks of it) was overpriced, and my \"veggie burger\" was actually beef. Thank goodness I'm not actually a vegetarian.

My friend called the restaurant to make sure her bun was gluten free when we discovered my burger wasn't veggie as she has a legitimate gluten allergy and they assured her it was and offered to give me a free burger due to the mix up (I didn't get it in case you were wondering, it was too out of the way).

I absolutely loved my beef burger, I didn't even care it wasn't what I ordered (obviously meant to be). Even though it's expensive I would go back again. They do burgers quite well. It was extremely tasty and spicy and I loved the meat, bun, and aoili. It didn't even need condiments! Much better than Montana's, Kelsey's, and Jack Astor's' burgers.

My boyfriend tried it and loved it too. We're going to give the Turtle Jack's Muskoka Grill in Brampton a try!"}
{"text":"I was here to grab lunch and instead decided to dine in. Although the place is quite busy, the customer service and the food was on point. I had chicken tenders and the chicken buffalo sandwich (I think that's what it was called) One word of advice, ghost pepper sauce should only be tried If you can handle spice!"}
{"text":"Worst martini ever. MSG tasting food. Scalding hot water in men's room. Beware."}
{"text":"A great Resturant where the atmosphere makes you feel like your at a cottage.

The service is better than most other restaurants. Waitress Laurence was one of those examples, my mother was very specific and harsh with her order, she acted like it was nothing and always answered with a smile. :)


Upon entry, we ordered and was given a FREE guacamole dip entre. They said it was part of their tradition they give this entree to new customers. 

It was Halloween and there was a sale on ribs with 2 additional entrees. The dip was NOT part of those 2 entrees :D. The ribs were SOOOO good. You could say I had a foodgasm. The ceasar salad was so so crispy with REAL bacon unlike the other franchises salads. The fries were also VERY crisp. We gave Laurence a huge tip because the service so astounding. 

You MUST come here before your life ends. No jokes."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for lunch. Their chicken wrap is amazing and their New York butter sauce is the greatest wing sauce I've ever had. Staff are friendly and the location is convenient. Those who have a sweet tooth should definitely try the fire and ice dessert. The cinnamon crusted vanilla ice cream is to die for and the caramel toffee sauce is probably the best thing you'll ever taste. Be warned, it is very sweet and a huge portion!"}
{"text":"I've dined here three times. The first two times were decent dining experiences. This review though is reflective of my last and final visit. Unfortunately my last visit was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in quite some time. There are a few things that makes a dinner an enjoyable experience. The atmosphere, the food, the service, the price and of course the location. This restaurant failed in a few of these areas.

The atmosphere at Turtle Jacks is nice. It suits my tastes. The restaurant has low lightning giving the feeling of comfort, it's decorated well and quite clean. No issues there. This location also has a nice patio that is covered. A perfect setting if the weather is just right.

The food was fair. In some ways it was decent, in others it was terrible. My wife and I had burgers, which were decent. My in laws had ordered the fish and chips. The fish was way overcooked, chewy and generally untasty they told me. The coleslaw that came with it was also chewy and lacked general taste.

The service was ok. Again not great. We were seated right away but had to wait longer than normal for our meals once we ordered. And after waiting for a lengthy time, my dinner was not brought to me. They had a \"glitch\" in the system and it wasn't made. So they brought my in laws food and they ate their food only after I insisted they start without me. After 10 minutes my burger finally arrived. Although they gave me fries on the side to munch on while I waited for my burger, the fries that came with my meal were cold. Our waitress was nice enough but charged us for my meal. It was only removed from the bill by the manager when we asked for it for free. It should've been taken care of off the bill to begin with. The staff apologized a few times, sincerely. We weren't terribly impressed though.

The prices are ok, and are par with other franchises similar to this style of dining. Location is good too. Just head a few mins west on 16th Ave, west of the 404.

Overall. Don't go here. Try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I can't figure out if turtle jacks is a franchise or not.  The one i used to go to was a sports bar.  The atmosphere was much nicer here and the business seemed to concentrate on the restaurant side more than the bar side.  I think the menu might be too busy.  The waitress told me that TJ's was famous for way too many things.  One of them being wings which weren't saucy so they failed in the wings which apparently they never get wrong.  Also, service wasn't great i finished my drink and she never came by to refill my cup...well she never came by again.  Took long for food, but the waitress came by to tell us it was coming out soon; i guess she realized it took too long to.

What went well...place was clean, nice cottage theme, fish taco was great and fresh.   They let me switch out salsa on the fish taco and the home fries were great.   Presentation of the food was very nice."}
{"text":"I was so happy that we stumbled into this place a little after 11pm . Ahh where do I start ? Our waiter name was z or zed I'm not to sure but she was absolutely amazing . She served us well , she was very helpful , very patience and sociable( how waiters should be ). I loved her ; on top of her service being so great , the food was amazing the chef definitely showed his skills . I wish I could rate this place with a heart of love. After not getting the best service with waiters while being in Canada and then to get amazing service and amazing food on our lastnight here , amazing . I'm very happy :)

And we were given a shrimp taco on the house !!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and even more amazing service! We had a cute blonde server, Samantha she was helpful and polite! 

I didn't know what sauce to put on my chicken fingers- she brought me two to taste with some French fries before they cooked it. 

Let us return one of the foods my mom didn't like and even gave us a free dessert to take home! The manager came and greeted us and apologized for the food that wasn't very tasteful and was the one who offered the dessert, didn't have to fight or argue. 

It's a great place! Amazing spinach dip. Amazing mojitos!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this TJ's a few times now while in the area for work and I really can't tell the difference between it and Moxie's. Even the menu items are almost identical.

Anyway, I stick with the Thai Salad which is full of crunchy, tasty veggies - definitely overpriced at $14, but what can you do? Service is fast and friendly at lunch, though they really push alcohol - who has drinks with lunch? And are you hiring?

Not bad - not great, but it'll do."}
{"text":"Omg! How is there more than one of these places? The appetizers were decent, calamari and bruschetta. I ordered wings which I previously believed would be difficult to mess up, boy, was I wrong. They messed up wings, and they messed up wings horribly.  The skin of the wings had a look as though they were just reheated and has sauce thrown on top.  We got the kids pizza, which looked like bread with cheese and ketchup on it, i could do anything to convince my kids to choke that down.

The kids meals usually come with an ice cream, not at Turtle Jacks, you get a rice crispy square.  They charged us an extra $2 for a sundae, granted it was with whipped cream and sprinkles, lol.  i also had the Skor brownie which was not too bad.

The service was nothing great, she was sometimes hard to get, but was always on top of the pop refills.  Friendly, but not overly so.

I went to the restroom, and one stalls door was broken and couldn't lock, and didn't look well maintained.

Unless its a night of just drinks, I think I've had my last visit here.  I feel like this meal is eating me back."}
{"text":"Turtle Jack's Oakville was stop number one on the EPIC International Chicken Wings crawl.  They have a lot of different, branching choices on their wing menu, including big or small wings, breaded or non-breaded, convection finished or BBQ finished and a ridiculous number of sauces to finish things up.  If you were to make a chart of the different combinations of all the choices you have to make before you ever see a wing, you could possibly exceed excel's 64000 row limit.  I'll leave the math to Randy, he's an engineer.

We stuck with the classic (smaller) wings, unbreaded in their New York Butter sauce and order one pound finished in the convection style and the other finished on the BBQ.  

The good:
- Overall I was surprised at how good this place was. It's a chain, and I would rank it up there with Jack Astors and Milestones, which to me are above Kelseys and Boston Pizza. I would never pick this place, but I wouldn't complain if someone else did.
- The wings were alright.  They were small.  My notes from the convection style were \"not saucy but not unhappy.\" 
- I liked the BBQ better than the convection but I think I was the only one.  It dried out the meat a bit more but it was a worthwhile trade off for the crispy outer skin.
- The music in the washrooms was WAY louder than in the dining room and I really liked that.

The bad:
- definitely not the cheapest wings we ate
- pathetic 2 celery and 2 carrots with wings order (we ordered another side of veggies with the 2nd order of wings)
- waitress brought us the wrong wings on the 2nd order - she brought us wings drowning in BBQ sauce instead of the NY butter sauce finished on the BBQ.  She rectified this immediately, but it took a long time.  We were here for over an hour.

Summary: I would go here again if someone asked me to but I wouldn't pick it.  Wings were decent but could have been saucier.  The flavour profile of NY butter sauce was good.  Final ranking 3/5 stops on the EPIC International Wing Crawl (tm sarahlindsay 2009)."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday.  It was mid afternoon so almost empty.
The decor is very pleasant and seem quite new.
I had the prime rib philly which was fantastic and I thought a good price as it also included a small cesar salad ($13.49)  The bun was very fresh and nicely toasted....so many great flavours to enjoy.

My hubby had the garlic shrimp and sea scallop pasta and he enjoyed it as well.

All around it was a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant but average food at above average prices. Waitstaff is average, and mostly really young teens who prefer talking among each other than interacting with customers."}

{"text":"A 3.5 would be better here, Kids pizza and Pasta were really enjoyable, the tomato soup and the beef soup were very good as well, the turkey burger was OK but the patty was pretty dry. Salads were considerably fresh as well. Service was pretty bad, attitude and the difficulty to find a server when needed is the main problem of this establishment. 
I will give it another try as the food was pretty solid."}
{"text":"Pure fraud 
Clearly email that corporate sent says 
Go in and get $10 off
Then they told me the email is bullsh8t and that I have to sign up AGAIN... 
But the funny thing is the big asterisk that says NEW members only so the system if I resign up will say I'm already registered and won't give me a code
Or b I'll go back again and they'll tell me to register.
Menu is limited. 
Staff is inattentive 
Food was good, but I can get good food elsewhere... 
I wrote review while I was waiting for food, I was mad, they must have read it, or waitress got scared for her tip and started caring.. 
2nd it's a spend 30$ for $10 off wouldn't you rather have your guest spend more and make him happy with 10 off instead of pissing him off, if I was a d7ck I would have just left and they could have tossed steak in the trash.. 
Business 101 -fail
Corporate was quick to reply and credit my account for the $10. But it shouldn't have escalated that far.."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was worst. Chicken was dry. Tried there buffalo chicken wrap on Sunday b4 Election Day and chicken with naan bread charged us $34. For 2 meals.  And buffalo chicken was requested grill but came out burned.  Will never return."}
{"text":"I went for appetizers.  The service was good but the food was terrible. 

We got nachos. They were stale and chewy. We also had potatoe skins which were also dry and tasteless. The sour cream also had a wierd sharp taste, like it was going bad.

I didn't even half finish it, not even a little bit, o Lord! Know yourself, know your worth.

I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Friday night, but managed to get a table fairly easily.
The service was prompt, the food was hot and fresh. 

My only complaint was that the waitress didn't seem to know how to handle a gift card and that threw her off quite a bit and extended our stay for 15 minutes longer than expected."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is bad. The new owners are dishonest and sneaky. I miss the previous management.  I heard every morning they use to make breakfast for all the staff. The previous management use to buy nuts for the bar. You know, those little things that change it from a business to a home. The new owners are a bunch from high school that play favorites with staff and customers. It is an absolute disgrace to the turtle jacks brand and message. The food is a step above its competitors but the service at this location is not worth the strain on wallet. Rude bartenders,  unaccountable management. Of i could give this a place a zero i would..."}
{"text":"I like to hear commentating when I watch a hockey game, but I also like to indulge in a good atmosphere by watching it in a bar. You can the best of both worlds at Turtle Jacks. Yes, other sports bars may do this but they don't have presence in suburbia. 


Savoury wings, decent nachos and a average beer menu ... You get TJs. I've been here three/four times now and I have to say that I've never left displeased. Service is spot on, but do expect some waits when the game is on and it's a packed house."}
{"text":"Went to Turtle Jack's for dinner last night with the kids and the grandparents.  Our waitress, Christine, was knowledgeable, helpful and fast.  My daughter ordered the wings (fryers, dusted, very crispy in bbq sauce).  They were delicious.  I had the blackened chicken salad with the chipotle ranch dressing (on the side of course!).  The dressing had a nice kick to it.  I really enjoyed the salad.  My son ordered a kid's brownie for dessert.  It was a huge piece for $1.99 and came warm with whipped cream.  He devoured it.  It was very moist.  The Prime Rib Dip (sandwich) was tasty but my dining partner said the meat was too salty for her.  I didn't try it so I can't say whether it was or not but I like salty food... One of the grandparents ordered the Fire and Ice dessert which reminded me of the fried ice-cream from Chi Chi's of long ago.  Very tasty and huge!  
They had live music at the bar area starting at 8 p.m. last night (Thursday) which was nice.  I would definitely go back to this restaurant.  We had a good experience there."}
{"text":"Went with my Dad, despite some questionable reviews. Attentive service, Burger special and beef dip were very good and served promptly."}
{"text":"Went here about 3 weeks ago for the first time ever with my family. We all loved it. My 5 yr old also loved it. They have a chest of toys.. Very kid friendly. Great staff and amazing food. 
And yes, we have gone back and will continue to."}
{"text":"Staying at the Double Tree and Yelp doesn't have any great auggestions for anything nearby.  So decided to stay in and eat at Turtle Jacks for supper.  

Friendly service at the bar.  Reasonable selection of beers.  Had half rack of ribs, very decent, tender and flavorful.

Worked fir me.

Wish they had Muskoka beers on tap!"}
{"text":"This place has always been a hit or miss for me. Mostly a miss. I've been here three times and service was consistently terrible. Let me talk aout my experiences. I once had to grab my own menus because nobody came by after they cleaned and seated us at a booth by the bar. When the hostess saw me grabbing my own menus she offered to bring it over because it's her job and she's just standing there doing nothing. Her words. The server was slow to take our order and it was an unpleasant experience overall. 

On my third visit I went with my sister and we had ordered the turkey and goat cheese on naan, with blackened chicken oppose to the turkey. Now when the meal came out the sandwich had burnt marks on it! Upon eating, the sandwich had a distinct burnt taste and was absolutely awful. We sent it back to the kitchen and the manager came by explaining that since they do grill the sandwich there would be burnt marks. Um, I don't think so. When we finally received our meal,  the sandwich was cold and still had that burnt flavour. I honestly don't think they clean their grill very often. The server came to check up on us when we had completed our meal which I didn't appreciate. Salad was wilted and had a bitter taste to it. The balsamic dressing they used is different than the other Turtle Jacks locations. 

Atmosphere wasnt too bad, but the music playing from the bar was insanely loud. So much so that the floor seemed to be vibrating and I could barely carry a conversation across the table. This is a restaurant, not a nightclub. I think it might have to do with the fact that the GM was a young man."}
{"text":"You don't need a review to tell you about a place like this, just go and see for youself, but here's mine.

The service staff at this location doesn't seem to really care about their job, they are all young and inexperienced.  (Perhaps at this location only)

The food quality is fair, but why come here?  Jack Astors or East side Marios is much better.  Yes, they have a bigger variety of wings here, but go to Wild Wings and they had hundred of different kinds!  Bottom line: their direct competitors are better.  

This place was empty as well, so... might not even be in business by the time you read this.

{"text":"Love this place. The staff is always friendly and attentive and the food comes out in good timing and is always fresh. We will definitely be back. 5/5!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this rating because I only went to the patio to have drinks with friends. I met up with the guys on a nice summer evening for drinks and appetizers. I didn't order food but did get a ceasar and it was amazing. One of the best that I have had. The guys ordered sweet potato fries and wings...they liked the food from what I could see from their expressions while they were eating. The patio is very nice with the couches.

My wife and I have been wanting to try the food there so one day we will be revisiting. The menu did have a lot of selection for the vegetarian or seafood lover. Will be updating this post hopefully soon in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is great! Not to mention how delicious the food was. I went for the first time last week and the staff made my experience so memorable. Our waitress was Sarah -- thank you for an awesome experience. I will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"We have now given this place three times tryout,giving them the benefit of the doubt.
But now I can fairly say that we won't be visiting this place again.
The 'only' pro in this place is that they have a nice patio, with comfy lounge patio chairs, however their patio usually opens up late in the summer, so you can't even enjoy that much!
The place (interior) is lacking many things, too much dark wood, lost theme, don't have a true identity really! Like you get lost trying to find a theme for this restaurant.

Food tastes below average, and we've always tried different things throughout our three visits.

Same applies to the service, but it's kind of a hit miss between bad and average.

In terms of pricing, it's a little more on the pricy level, which can't be justified taking everything inconsideration!

I give it 2.5"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible.  The waitress are not attentive at all, or maybe because the lighting of this restaurant is so dark they can't see the patrons requiring service.  The food takes forever to arrive.  Our apps took 30 minutes to arrive during a Wednesday night when it wasn't even busy at the restaurant.  I notice this is a problem with this entire franchise...the service is always terrible at all the turtle jack's I've been to.

They have a nice patio at this location, but the service here really ruins it."}
{"text":"I just left this place and usually when I come here, I get the fish tacos... It's like the only thing I like on the menu, at this franchise. Anyway, I didn't get any fish tacos, but I'll tell you what I got! I got a Sunset Sangria with the warm fudge brownie and caramel chocolate sauce with whip cream. Yup. That's all I got, I was craving for something sweet and I came back from walking on the trail, so I wanted something sweet and simple to satisfy my cravings and I did! It was pretty decent... the bartender who fixed my drink... knew what she was doing, I enjoyed my drink and would proudly order it Again. The waitresses are a bit slow and were more focused on the crowd but did come around and asked how everything was going, so that was decent enough"}
{"text":"Took literally 20 mins to see a waitress (after asking)
Another 20 to get our drinks.
Food took forever 
Food was not that great
The wait time for everything to arrive was horrible."}
{"text":"Dropped by Turtle Jacks on  Wednesday during lunch time... had no idea what I want to eat or what I should be eating.....

Then I saw the Wednesday Beer and Burger Specials... so for $13.99 you can pick any burger on the menu (of course I won't be eating the basic one...) with a pint of domestic!!

I usually try not to drink before sunset, especially the day after an Elite party! But I am weak, I just could not resist a special...so be it! Let's drink beer!

Jalapeno Jack with Beer ($13.99)
- The patty was a little charred but not bad, at least the inside was not dry
- love the side choice of fries, salad or soup, which I choose the chicken gumbo to go with my spicy burger!

Services was good and professional.

Free Wifi and other specials every day! I might need to come back for the Happy Hour Specials : 50% off appetizers!!! and of course other drinks special too everyday!"}
{"text":"not sure what to say about  the staff. some were inappropriate when speaking to each other. just not professional. drinks took extremely long to come out. it would have been nice to have drinks and appetizers then dinner. but, instead almost everything came to the table at once. the music playing was extremely loud and not sensored - yes, my guests and I heard cursing in the songs. I would have liked to see a seamless customer service from beginning to end. but, it wasn't for my first and last visit there. I can't even say this place is family friendly with the type of music they play. 
I had ordered a Steak as my main course. I'm not surprised it was tough, and veggies were too oily."}
{"text":"So this is supposed to be Canadian cuisine?
The atmosphere may have that rustic Canadiana theme, but the menu is rather lackluster. Steaks, burgers, wings, calamari, nachos, blackened fish -- sounds like most other casual American chain restaurants.
Rather mediocre."}
{"text":"Great Service, Clean, Friendly Staff, Affordable."}
{"text":"New and perhaps kinks will get worked out.  Waited 90 minutes at lunch for Food to be served for party of 4.    Two of the hot meals were cold and had to be returned causing further wait.  One ordered chicken and got salmon.  Two of us ordered soup as appetizer and specifically asked that it come out first and was assured it would.  We ordered fries as side to our meal.  Waiter brought ketchup and vinegar before meals for fries.  In the end soup came out with sandwiches.  No fries.  All in all terrible service.  Mediocre and cold food.  Nice atmosphere but this place has a long way to go to attract long term business."}
{"text":"Where do I start... not sure why I see a lot of good reviews. To begin, we arrived to this restaurant and it was pretty empty! We waited at the front for about 15 minutes (no I'm not joking) until we peaked into the bar side and someone told the bartender we were waiting. 

The service was.. not that great. Despite our waitress being kind, she forgot to place our order on a few items. I ordered a drink probably 30 minutes after sitting down and only got it after our meal and the mojito was so watered down!! Never again. She was kind of on the slow side.

For an appetizer we got Big Bang shrimp, which tasted really good! I got pasta as my main meal which I enjoyed as well. For dessert we got muskookies and the Lake Rousseau butter tart. The muskookies tasted good! However, the butter tart was NOT! It was so hard, like even the knife couldn't cut through it..

Despite our waitress being nice and our meal tasting good, there were a lot of things I did not enjoy about our visit here. Most likely won't be returning here. 2 stars for our waitress being kind, and the appetizer, main course and 1 dessert being good."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful.....if I could rate lower than 1 star I would.

4 of us went in tonight for dinner...wish we hadn't. 

Person 1 - ordered fish tacos with side Caesar. Was brought out fish tacos with fries. Fries were replaced when pointed out to the waitress.
Person 2 - ordered Asian Stir fry. Was brought out fish tacos with fries. This person had to wait 15 minutes after our food came out to get her correct order. 
Person 3 - ordered their \"Hell of a burger\" ( burger with jalapenos, etc). Was brought out a bacon cheeseburger. When I asked our waitress about it what type of burger I got...she looked at it and said \" that's a bacon cheeseburger....not what you ordered\". No offer was made to correct the mistake or bring jalapenos.
Person 4 - Wing dinner. Actually was the only person to get what they ordered.

Food took over 1 hour to come out...and it wasn't even close to being correct. Waitress blamed kitchen for everything. She told us she would comp the mix up with the stir fry...when our bill came it was still on it. Had to get another staff member to remove it.

Perhaps our orders would have been correct if our waitress didn't spend so much time dropping by tables where her friends were seated. We had to ask several other staff members to either correct her error or ask her to drop by. She did refill our pop without asking....but maybe apologizing rather than avoiding us would have been better. 

Will never step foot in here again."}
{"text":"Hosted my company's Christmas party at Turtle Jack's and I'm really satisfied with how the staff took care of us.

We (27 people) were given our own semi closed off area with a tv and felt right at home with good food and good company while watching the leafs game (boo leafs! Go Habs go!). 

The manager was super kind to hook us up with two free veggie nachos and I truly appreciate his customer service. As a meal, I had the shepherd's pie from the seasonal menu and found it filling and great for the price. 

I highly suggest Turtle Jack's as an alternative to the crowded hwy7&404 crowded plaza as there is quite a variety of food on the menu and there are ample parking spots!"}
{"text":"Over all it was good area for a Saturday night place to go to. You can be a bit loud and not to be rude.  
The food was average. Because this restaurant has been around if a while. I expected to be a bit more uptight. But the blackened basa I order was pretty salty and too much seasoning on time to digest. But it's mash potato was really good."}
{"text":"Came here for my bday dinner last weekend and my boyfriend called to make a reservation asking to be seated in-front of the tv so we can watch the game. When we got there the lady was putting us in a secluded area without a tv but we wanted to watch both the bball and hockey games (Go leafs go!) Anyhow, the manager stepped in and figured out a solution and within a few minutes seated us as requested. He even checked in on us a couple of times to make sure we were good. Super pleased about that. I loved my honey garlic chicken tenders and the coleslaw was flavourful too. Enjoyed my night!"}
{"text":"We decided to try out Turtle Jack's through a WagJag promotion.  It was an overall good experience - the food is reasonably priced, the portion sizes are what you would expect from one of these chain-type restaurants.  The food that I had was done well, although not outstanding.  So, I would say that the restaurant was good, but not great.  But I certainly would be willing to try it again.  Our server was outstanding though."}
{"text":"Come here if you have lots of time on your hands and nothing else planned for your evening. We've been sitting here for an hour and a half and our meals still haven't arrived. Very poorly organized and terrible service."}
{"text":"Turtle Jacks was the first stop on our Epic International Chicken Wing Crawl of Awesomeness, and a convenient bus ride away from home for me.

The wings themselves were pretty good - plenty of options for flavouring, as well as preparation (convection or BBQ), breading, size, etc. We went with the New York style, both convection and BBQ. Very tasty, though the convection weren't as intense a flavour. I liked BBQ better, I think. Vegetables were woefully insufficient on the first round, but they picked up on the second.

Environment-wise, it kind of reminds me of a Montana's but taken down a couple notches - not over the top, and no kraft paper on the tables. There's flair all over the place, but it feels kind of contrived, and offset by the high ceiling to a metal roof, which hammers home the point that you're in a suburban strip mall and not an actual lodge in Muskoka. Still, a decent effort.

Washrooms are cramped but clean -  had anyone tried to get into the stall behind me there would have been shoving issues, and that just isn't cool.

Staff was friendly and took care of the mixed up order without difficulty, but the replacement did take a while. Also, prices aren't exactly cheap, but this IS Oakville, after all.

I'd rate them at #3 of 5 on the Chicken Wing crawl, and will probably return - they are basically in my back yard, after all."}
{"text":"Not my first time. Food and service is pretty good wirgmh a nice ambiance. I had the Bison burger which was tasty with juice to want more also they had JLHOR on the wine list which I love."}
{"text":"I come to this place when I am in Toronto on Business. Close to the airport with great food and best service from the prettiest waitresses you can find. 5 stars just for the smiles. 
Wine selection is good, entrees are excellent and so are the meals. Price is fair. I will be back."}
{"text":"We went for a Valentines day lunch around 1:30pm and hade an amazing time! Got nachos as our app which was fantastic, our mains were the 4 Cheese Cajun Chicken Penne and the Chicken Parmesan. Both dishes arrived just minutes within us finishing the app. My boyfriend especially enjoyed the cajun pasta! For desert we got the Skor's brownie with ice cream. We would definitely recommend it! Overall our service was great & the food was great! The only thing was that once we prolonged our stay they gave us the bill without us asking and started cleaning up the table but hey we can take a hint!"}
{"text":"Went to this location on a Sunday afternoon - April 2nd, 2017. Stood at the entrance for a few minutes with my friend and husband, who are tall, waiting to be greeted.  Waitress looked right as us. We were never greeted and was never told they would be with us in a second. My friend looked at the menu at the greeting station. Still no one greeted us. We walked right out. Great job greeting and seating customers. Not. 
I love Turtle Jack's. I recommended my friend to go there and get the Chicken Fajita which is really good. But I guess this location isn't where I should take her."}
{"text":"Typical franchise Americana type fare, nothing to write home about but their late night menu and some of their entres are OK. Lots of screens and booths in the bar plus the dining hall has ample seating. I agree with other reviewers the food and service can really be hit or miss, depends on the day and how busy they are. 

One thing to note, if they mess up call them out on it and management will usually try to make it right. Mistakes happen and they usually own up to it when it's their fault so don't be shy if you're unhappy or unimpressed. There's a Montana's and a Boston Pizza down the street so make sure they're on point, I don't believe in settling for mediocrity even with chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I love coming to this restaurant, servers are very courteous and the chicken wings with the extreme New York butter sauce are the best I've ever had. Will definitely come back in the near future"}
{"text":"Overall, good experiences when dining there.  Most recently, we were served by John who, although very busy, was very friendly and made sure to check in on us.  He was also amazing with our 15 month old.  I had the stir fry, my husband had a steak, and our daughter had a burger with gluten free bun.  My only criticizm of the stir fry is that the green onions in it were far too plentiful, especially since they were large slices and not diced/chopped.

Overall a great family dinner out and we'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I came here for a dinner a few days ago on a weekday with 2 other people. The service could be faster but there was only one waitress and one hostess/waiter? It was my fault for saying we wanted all the food at the same time. I feel like if the dishes came out as they were prepared, we wouldn't have had to wait ~20 minutes for the food. 

I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. It had the bar area like Jack Astor's and the booths like Milestones with dim lighting. If you're a sports fan, they position the TV's all around the place so no matter where you're sitting, you can watch the action.

The menu was standard American food (with some Mexican dishes) with similar pricing compared to competitors. We ordered the following items:

8oz. Top Sirloin - $25.49 - Ordered medium rare and it was cooked between rare to medium rare. I was satisfied with the quality of the meat. It could be more tender but you can't expect too much at this price point. The portion of the baked potato it came with was very generous. More generous than any other restaurant I've been to. Same goes for the side of vegetables.

Blackened Basa - $22.99 - Generous layer of guac on top. Dish was flavourable and wasn't overly salty. The only thing I would say to improve the dish is to cut down the level of blackening (is this a verb?). It dries the fish out a lot.

Baked Onion Soup - $8.49 - Liked the flavour of the soup, not overly salty or strong in onion flavour, did not like the thickish layer of cheese on top of it. 

Basa Fish Tacos $16.49 w/ quinoa and arugula salad + $1.99 - I feel like if they used another type of fish, it would taste better. I wasn't a fan of the chipotle honey dressing but I'm biased towards not liking spicy food. I wouldn't order this dish again because the two other mains tasted much better. The salad, on the other hand, was delicious. I liked the dressing it came with.

10 pc. Fryers (Wings) with Signature NY Butter Sauce - $13.99 -The only reason why I ordered this dish was because I was curious as to what this sauce would taste like. It ended up tasting like it was only coated with butter. I was fine with it but I know a lot of people wouldn't be. I find this dish to be not worth the price because the size of the wings were so small. Plus they only give 2 pieces of carrots and celery for one order.

The total came about to $122 incl. tips and taxes for 3 people. Is that too pricey? You be the judge. I would come back again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to persuade people to eat here."}
{"text":"I'm actually giving Turtle Jack's a 1.5/5, not a 1/5.

My sister really wanted to go out for dinner last night so she suggested that we could go to Turtle Jack's. She had a good experience last time so what could go wrong this time, right?

We arrived at 6:30 pm and the place was quite busy. All of the booths were taken so we decided to just sit at a table for 4 instead of waiting. That was a smart move for both of us, you'll find out why later. 

The hostess and our server were nice and friendly...and that's the only good thing I can remember about our dining experience. My sister ordered the shrimp and scallop pasta while I ordered a small order of honey garlic wings. It took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive and we were starving by the time the food arrived. Both of our dishes were just warm and didn't seem so fresh. My sister's pasta tasted pretty basic and plain. She said it tastes like Walmart's Great Value frozen entree and that Michelina's frozen entree's taste better. The chicken wings I had were VERY tiny, it must've came from a baby chicken. I felt kind of bad eating it too. The skin was crunchy and the flavouring was alright but the meat wasn't hot and a bit dry.

We left the restaurant VERY disappointed and I was actually still very hungry. That was my first visit to Turtle Jack's and my last."}
{"text":"Sat night dinner 6.30pm
Seated to table in 15 minutes. Friendly staff. 
Had calamari (I'll ask for more well done next time) and wings dusted. Sauce on side.  
Tomato soup was tasty.  Filled with lots of grinded bits of tomato. 
Nachos with ground beef was a great portion
, had lots of beef and cheese too. Yummy 
Bison Burger was delicious, filled with ground bison in small chunks. 
Server was friendly, attentive and always checking to make sure all was well."}
{"text":"After bombing out at Harpers for food, and downtown Oakville being a literal ghost town, we headed to my Oak-Villager's other hang out.  Yep.  A Turtle Jack's.  A place to remind us of how cottage life would be if we could afford a place in Muskoka - or just another reason to put out cool Muskoka Chairs everywhere!

Low expectations were set in my mind but surprisingly, I had a pleasant time.  The server was really great, but the best was just having a conversation with all the people in the bar area.  We all were having fun watching the rest of the Leafs game where Kadri finally came out of his scoring slump!  Go Blue!

The location is much like all the other places that have opened up over the past decade.  Huge Bar/Lounge area served by gals in tight outfits.  A dining area where they can accommodate the less rambunctious people or kids.

The food is passable.  Between the beers and more beers, I thank my palette for going to sleep so I can get some sort of food in.

2.5 for the meal.  +1 for the service and fun with the locals.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Great service at this location.  We usually order appetizers and share.  Good value for the money you are spending and love the wait staff there"}
{"text":"I had another good meal here with good service. As I seated in the bar area, the waitress asked for my drink order. 

When my friend arrived, I ordered the quinoa and arugula salad with steak. It had a mix of red and white quinoa, arugula, soy beans, green beans, crumbled goat cheese, and the steak was cooked to perfection. I asked for medium rare and that's exactly what I got. Even my friend had to have a bite. It was all delicious.

The waitress did check up on us a few appropriate times.

At the end of our visit, our waitress asked if we wanted dessert but we declined as we were already full from our meals."}
{"text":"A perfect local spot for a convenient meal or a beer with buddies. Friendly service and a nice bar area. Decent wings too!
I've become a regular for a pint with the boys.
Btw, there IS a patio in the summer unlike what the profile says..."}
{"text":"Food is good but don't love the menu options. Always some kind of glitch when I'm here. Not my favorite place but it's not terrible either. It's convenient and kids like it"}
{"text":"Went there on Thursday night.  It was a pretty dull night. 
Placed the order of blackened basa. To my surprise, it was more delicious than I expected. The chimichuri sauce did wonders. I loved the meal.
Only suggestion: the salad greens could've been a tad bit fresher."}
{"text":"Terrible service. There was no cutlery at the table and when asked for it, the waitress indicated that it was a strange request. 

Will not be going back. 

Food was awful as well."}
