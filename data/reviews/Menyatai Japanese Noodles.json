{"text":"Great place to bond with friends and share amazing food. 
Very cozy but modern interior."}
{"text":"My friends and I has a monthly exploring day where we check out different place in the city. After reading the great reviews this place has on yelp, We decided to try this place out.

I wish my stomic and wallet can affort more of it. It was pleasant experience and a very happy meal.

If I lived around the area, I could see myself making frequent trips to this place."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! Noodle texture is perfect and reminds me of the ramen places in Vancouver. This Small restaurant seats ~24. If dining with a group, be sure to be on time as they seat everyone when the group is all there. I was there on a Sunday and there was a line-up before they opened. Place filled up within 10 minutes. Would recommend the Tonkatsu Ramen. If you like spice the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen hits the spot!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Everything I've tried was really fantastic. I loved the food so much. I wish this place was bigger because more people need to try it."}
{"text":"Ate here when stayed in Calgary for a night. It was Saturday evening, the street parking is free after 6pm. The restaurant was pretty full. My husband and son got udons. The bowls were small. My spicy Tokotsu Ramen came in big bowl. The taste was just fine."}
{"text":"We were lucky we showed up at 5:15pm, just as the restaurant was opening and got a table. Not 15 min later, there was a line up to be seated.
Menyatai is a cute, just like their friendly servers.
Our apps ( gomae and wakakame salad) came out quick and so did our ramen.
Is it the best ramen I've tasted? No, but definitely does the job when craving a big bowl of noodles for a decent price."}
{"text":"Delicious! Service was friendly and fast. As inexperienced noodle eaters, this was an excellent first time experience. The pan fried gyoza was incredible!"}
{"text":"A very nice, cozy Japanese noodle house that sticks primarily to ramen & udon soup and a few appetizers. The milky tonkotsu broth was both delicate and flavorful at the same time, and unrivaled by any other spots in town I've been to. The curry soup base was not as impressive, nor was the noodle texture... but both soups were topped by truly glorious sliced pork. Extra pork is a menu option and I highly recommend it! Relatively affordable & unpretentious, it's a good non-sushi spot to go with friends or a casual date."}
{"text":"I love their broth here! its very clear and not to salty. The only con is that its quite small, and the wait time can be long. Parking is quite a pain too, considering its in Kensington and street parking can be hassle to find."}
{"text":"Got the extra BBQ miso ramen ... Delicious in every way ... Good enough portions .. Lots of soup and lots of noodle :) amazing stop for heavenly ramen as good as vancity ... But ... Sorry Gyoza was a total disaster ... Oily and might be slight undercooked ... Didn't have that crispy bottom!!! So three stars today is fair enough ... Service was excellent... Everyone was  so nice polite and kind ! We will return for more ramen !!!"}
{"text":"Had the Spicy Miso Ramen.  The fact that all the waitresses and cooks speak Korean, and that they are playing Korean music in the restaurant should've triggered a flag for me, but I decided to order anyway.  I'm not trying to be racist, because regardless of race, all I care about is good food.

The noodles are standard (which is fine), the pork had a good aroma but was slightly dry.  The menma is cooked correctly, and the spring onion accompanies the noodle well.  However, the most disappointing part is the soup. It's just a spicy soup that you cannot taste the miso, and there lacks any depth or complexity if you go past that spiciness.  The spiciness isn't from spicy miso, it's closer to those Korean spices that you taste from the instant noodles.   When I ordered spicy miso ramen, I expected Miso ramen + spicy miso, not some bland soup with spiciness added on top.  I mean, at least let it taste like a miso broth.

For a $14 bowl of ramen, there are way better options."}
{"text":"This place has clear Ikea vibe d√©cor, looks quite clean at the trendy Kensington area, so young people like the atmosphere, however, since there's not many noodle/ramen competition in Calgary, it makes this place looks extra appealing, more than it deserves in my opinion. 

The Japanese noodle requires 3 main factors, good broth, fresh noodles and flavoured meat, and Menyatai failed all three of them, the broth either really oily and salty with a film or grease on the surface of the noodle (Tonkatsu) or it's tasteless like water over soy sauce (shio).
Noodle tastes like cheap HKese egg noodles with dead texture, and the meat (bbq pork) favours was just not there, not to mention the lukewarm broth when it first comes.
 
On top of that, because the place is relatively small, it always has people waiting by the entrance, therefore, the server would come and ask to clear my noodle bowl 3-4 times within 20 min after it's served, like, they cannot wait for you to dump your noodles down and leave so they can sell more bowls!  One time I felt so rushed I got stomach-ache afterward because she came and asked to clear the bowl so many times while I was still eating it.

They serve mediocre noodles at best, real good ramen don't taste like this."}
{"text":"This is a cute little ramen shop in Kensington. Most of the tables are for 2 only so if you have a bigger party, make sure to call and make reservations. We went on a Tuesday night at 6:30 pm and there were still plenty of empty tables but after 7 the place quickly filled up and people were still waiting by the time we left. 

We ordered shio ramen, curry ramen, and miso ramen. My favourite out of the three was probably the curry ramen as it's not a flavour you see often in Calgary. There was a nice hint of spice too. (I was pleasantly surprised because I find a lot of authentic Japanese food to be really lacking in in the spice department.) You get a generous helping of green onions, bamboo shoots, corn and bean sprouts with your noodles. The ramen is topped with seaweed, chashu pork, and a soft boiled egg. The egg was the best part! The chashu pork was lightly grilled but not as soft or fatty as I would have liked. 

At $12-$14 per bowl, their ramen is quite pricey! I was expecting to be blown out of the water after hearing the good reviews about this place. Their ramen is good but I think Shikiji wins this round (love the fatty pork there), sorry Menyatai!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is hidden off of Kensington Avenue but is a great find!  I lived overseas for several years and this is the closest thing I have had in Calgary to sitting in a noodle house in in Yokosuka, Japan.  

I have been to this restaurant several times and the service has always been wonderful and the food straight up.  My favorite dish is the Spicy Miso Ramen with BBQ Pork - complete with century egg, seaweed, and sweet corn steeped in a beautiful steamy broth... simply put, there's nothing better on a cold Calgary evening when the snow is falling.  Appetizers to consider include the Goma-Ae (Cooked Spinach with Sesame Seed Dressing) and the Tempura Prawns however, I have to warn you - the Tempura Prawns should be listed under the dessert menu - it's the candy of the sea!  

It's a small venue but there is rarely a long wait.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Had a great bowl of ramen here last night. I went with the spicy tonkatsu ramen, no mushrooms and no sprouts. Mmm it was so good! Probably the best piece of pork I've had in a bowl of ramen. Next time I'd choose extra pork because it was really delicious.

My daughter loved the Kake Udon as well.

The restaurant is pretty small, so definitely go early if you don't want to wait.

Service was great. Friendly servers and fast delivery of food.

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here starving looking for a quick bite.  What we got was lacklustre service and ramen that is no better than any other place in Calgary, if not worse because of the horrendous service.  We were sat at the \"bar\" on flimsy stools that leant forward so far the only way to remain upright was to rest our knees on the partition that separates the service area.  There were a few tables to be cleared when we got there but decided on the bar as it was right away.  Ten minutes later we had to ask for a menu, ten minutes after that we had to ask to order.  The server that eventually helped us was friendly enough but we were not off to a good start as the other 2 staff just stood around laughing and having a good old time talking to each other.  There was a couple of gentlemen sitting next to us at the bar that asked to be seated at a table, there were a few empty, because they found it hard to sit on the stools.  The 2 mean girls laughed and looked around, unbelievable!  After the customers pleading they eventually moved them to a table.  At this point we are still waiting for our ramen, having been there coming up on 45 minutes.  Other tables were sat and had their food before us, we should have walked but were starting to get hangry and it would not have been a good scene to go without food much longer.  When we finally got our food it was nothing spectacular, certainly not worth the wait or miserable experience.

I don't know if they have a dishwasher in the back but it appeared as though they were simply rinsing off the dishes in a sink and setting them out to dry.  Needless to say I only used the disposable chopsticks.  

I usually don't take the time to review but felt it necessary in this case.  If you want average food with the taste soured by service that is by far the worst I've ever experienced than by all means enjoy!  If you want to enjoy the full experience, go elsewhere!  We've been to Goro & Gun, Muku and Shikjii, all are worth your hard earned money!"}
{"text":"Horribly disappointed. But then again, good for Calgary? Horrible service as well. Just because you are the only few ramen places in Calgary doesn't mean service goes out the window. Won't be wasting time or money here again"}
{"text":"Menyatai Ramen was okay... I was hoping for a delicious bowl of ramen, however my partner's beef don it was surprisingly very delicious! The miso soup that comes with the rice bowl was very bland and was not that great. I got extra bbq pork  tonkatsu for $14.95. It was pretty pricy, but it came with a lot of topping like corn, loads of green onion, woodear, bean sprout, 3 piece of bbq pork and egg. The broth was bland but hot. Noodle was good but kinda taste like instant noodle (so sad :( ). I Read some other reviews and they said the egg was good, but it was just a boiled egg that you can cook at home for 3-4 min to get the same consistency. The bbq pork use to be one of the highlights on the ramen (for me), from my previous visits, but this time it did not have the amazing wow factor I remember and hoping for. Overall experience for the ramen was not good at all, maybe the spicy would be good, maybe? 

As mentioned earlier the beef don was surprisingly very good! Loaded with sushi rice with a lot of beef that is mixed with onion and mushroom. The sauce was very flavourful and sweet! mix it with green onion it was perfection! 

I would come back to try other rice bowls or try udon. The table next to me had udon and it looked very good!"}
{"text":"The place was crowded, kinda justify the anticipation initially.  But food was just average.  Broth was fairly salty.  Tasted better ramen elsewhere with lesser rating. Service was quick to cater the streaming in crowd.... also with the small area, felt pressured to rush your meals."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere, delicious food, and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Decent ramen for Calgary, but definitely not as good as what you can get in Vancouver. 

I ordered the tonkatsu shoryu ramen with pork, the broth wasn't very milky nor flavourful and the pork was fatty. There were lots of ramen noodles though.

My friend had the shio ramen and he said it was nothing more than very salty.

However the ramen were still better than the other places in Calgary that I've tried. I will keep on exploring other ramen places, and won't come back again unless none of the other places measure up...or unless I learn how to make the proper one at home!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Just noticed that there wasn't any Japanese working here lol. It's all Korean.  Oh well, it's a good place to eat. Clean inside, and the staff are pretty good. 
I guess Japanese and Korean's use similar ingredients in their cooking. flavors are okay, just wished the sauces were a bit sweeter.
I had the Ramen, which came with a healthy portion of noodles. The pork that accompanied my ramen was tasty as well.
I'd say I was a regular here, eating here at least twice a month.
However on my last visit, it seems the girls that were working were all new. Not the usual girls I've seen in the past."}
{"text":"First time trying this Ramen place after trying 2 others, and I can say they didn't fail either. We were greeted promptly upon entrance and were ushered to a bench since it's the 4 of us, tight space but manageable with the limited space they have. We browsed the menu after ordering our drinks and I'm happy to see they're thoughtful enough to bring a bowl and cutleries for my 4 y/o as an afterthought that he's not familiar with chopsticks yet. We ordered appetizers namely the takoyaki , sea weed salad and fried squid. We like the swiftness it took for them to deliver , nothing too fancy about the appetizers nor beyond expectations but I do love the softness of the squid and my sons actually loved it too. Soup time came, we ordered our usual tonkatsu Ramen, and the thing that made a difference with the other places is its broth, it has a different texture, and spice on it, hubby hinted the lemon grass, I can say it's wonderfully combined together. A mixture of spice, meat and veggies were in a nice harmony, creating a wonderful ambiance of taste and aroma.. we will be going back for a taste of the other soups, for sure!"}
{"text":"The location is nice, the interior is nice, the staff are nice but the soup and the price was only average (about $13/bowl). I think part of it is because I've been spoiled by Vancouver ramen! I've been here a few times before, and the Tonkotsu is my favourite one. The egg is pretty well made, and so is the chasu but personally I think the soup lacks richness. It is decent for what it is and if I were in the area I would stop by again. If you are stopping by I would recommend just walking from Sunnyside station, as it can be difficult to find good parking in the area."}
{"text":"Value for money is really good. Serving is huge and service is quick too and servers speaks good english. I like the takoyaki  but I think there should be more meat im their noodles."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Delicious ramen noodles. The spicy versions add some extra flavour but are not too spicy at all. Had the spicy tonkotsu ramen and my friend had the curry ramen and. Made it spicy. Would highly recommend the spicy curry ramen."}
{"text":"I was in Japan a few months ago, and this place holds true to making authentic Japanese ramen.

I love the decor. Very modern, and very hip. Wicked vibe. The seating is small, but the staff do a great job with using the space they have. They'll take your number down, and call you when you're up next. Kensington's not a shabby place to wander and kill some time.

I've been here twice. Their gyoza's were delicious. They even have takoyaki! Their ramen noodles were cooked to the right amount. I hate it when noodles are under-/over-boiled. The ramen broth is not overly salty like many places. Great service. 

If you love unagi, go here. They serve an Unagi Don Bowl, which gives you more than your craving of unagi. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's not bad in any way, shape, or form... But it's not great. I had high hopes given the reviews, but the broth just wasn't rich enough or close to what I'm used to for Japanese ramen. I'm guessing it's owned by Koreans given the staff and flavor profiles. 

I had the spicy miso and okinomiyaki... Both were decent. I'll probably come back,but only after I try the other ramen spots.

Extra star for fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Ordered Shio Extra BBQ ramen. Timed it and guess what? It arrived in less than 7 minutes. To be fair I was the first guest for the day though. My order was good but I found it a little watery. Ambience was nice and place was clean and pleasant. Staff was great as well! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"NOOOOOOODLES.

I love me some Ramen, so when a friend suggested we check out this place for dinner there was no complaints from me! 

I have been here before and had a very pleasant experience, the space is small but cozy and the service is great - very polite. 

I always have the Spicy Miso but this time I wanted to have something different and tried the Shio. It was good but lacked that \"oomph\" in the broth... I felt it needed some more spice. 

Overall, you should just go and have some Ramen here, it warms the soul and pleases your tummy."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Loved the udon , good service and cozy decor. Would definitely recommend and come back again. 
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great place for quick bite
Casual and with a nice ambience & good livelihood 
Menu has a variety of choices but is not overdone."}
{"text":"We walked 30 minutes to get there at 2:14pm. They told me that they were closed 10 minutes ago. I saw a lot of people were still eating there! And the closing hour on their website is 2:30pm. If they stopped taking people at 2pm. They should adjust closing time to 2pm, so I don't waste my time and energy to get there."}
{"text":"Went for some ramen with girlfriends last night as it was cold - like we needed an excuse :)

For a group of 3 or more, your whole party needs to be there before you are seated. Not a problem with me as the tables seemed to turn over pretty quickly and the servers were on the ball clearing tables so that the next group could be seated. 

Order of Shrimp Sui Mai in sauce to share as it came with 6 pieces. Nice and tasty and good little snack before diving into a bowl of ramen.

Both my friends had the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen, which they quite enjoyed. Both of them said the first sip of broth was really spicy but then it mellowed out a bit. Seemed to enjoy every mouthful.

I had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen which had a good flavoured broth. Know that it should have been saltier than the regular Tonkotsu Ramen but didn't find it salty at all. Think the regular Tonkotsu Ramen may be a little bland, but this broth was very tasty.

All of the bowls came with mountains of ramen. There were noodles all the way to the top of the broth, and even though I managed to eat every mouthful I am really glad there wasn't any more in that bowl as I would have been to full to eat it.

Very prompt service, ramen came hot and steaming, lovely little restaurant. If it is busy in there could see that there might be a bit of a wait, but saying that everyone seemed to eat and go.

Will definitely come back if craving another bowl of deliciousness."}
{"text":"My boyfriend love Ramen. That's how I'm introduced to Ramen. I was checking out this place due the rating on Yelp. Let me tell you, it didn't disappoint me. I ordered a spicy Ramen and my boyfriend ordered a curry one. Both were flavorful and delicious. Definitely recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Had the shoyu ramen, cold noodles, miso ramen and unagi don. Food is great! Staff are friendly and clean"}
{"text":"A Korean owned ramen shop. Cute and convenient location, though the ramen soup lacked flavour and the meat portion was anemic at best. The search for decent ramen in Calgary continues..."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh ramen noodles! Not too much sodium and lots of flavor. Nice, comfortable and casual vibe.  When we visit Calgary again we'll definitely be back! Everything was super delicious and flavorful!"}
{"text":"If your cousin ran away with your dog ... and you were really broken up about it ... and maybe ... say ... your soul needed curry ramen soup to make the world seem like a nicer place...this place is where you would go for that curry ramen soup.  You can order it with extra pork... so ... trust me, you'll forget about the dog.  You might also forget about the cousin ... until he broke back into your apartment and stole 3 futon covers... then I would say try the Tonkotsu Ramen with the extra egg.  Delish."}
{"text":"Here is the best ramen in Calgary!!!!
I have ordered spicy miso ramen only though lol.
Not bad portion!!and tasty and tasty!!"}
{"text":"Menyatai has delicious, high-quality ramen and other Japanese noodles. Its also ridiculously cute. Why do you even need to know more?

I've been here for ramen a few times now, getting the curry ramen and the spicy Tonkotsu ramen. A lot of the photos do a great job of showing you the quality of the egg, corn and pork. But what they don't do is tell you how ridiculously delicious that broth is. It's like a hug for your entire body and I will undoubtedly be seen here more and more as the weather gets colder. As far as value for your money goes, this ramen is the best I know of.

The staff I've dealt with are all wonderful people.  I find there's sometimes a bit of a language barrier, but only in a way that makes me smile. I've always been able to get order I'm hoping for and I always leave happier than when I went in."}
{"text":"Yum.  Really good ramen tonaktsu.  A bit skimpy on the grilled pork but so tasty.  I like the bouncy chewy texture of the traditional noodles.  Versus some other noodle houses with more of a wheaty pasta like straight noodle. Broth was nicely flavoured also.
Downside is the size of the restaurant especially if you have four or more. Could be a long wait then if you are more than a party of two.  I've seen better turnover at some smaller venues at places like NY and Washington where the setup is more of a simple bar like sitting area and then customers just dine and dash.
Also parking in Kensington is a bit of a nuisance on busy nights.
Noodles as good as the old Shikiji ramen.  Better than their newer version which I'm not as big a fan of as they are not the same traditional curly noodle style."}
{"text":"Really nice and cosy place. Had to wait for lunch at 1.30pm in the afternoon. Guessing it probably gets really busy at meal times. Had miso ramen and shio ramen. Both came with a thick slice of pork and pretty awesome! Check it out if U are in the area. Worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats hot soup on a cold day. Came her for a late lunch and it was busy. The place is small and has a few tables not good for large groups. There's street parking only. 

Our server was friendly and our food came out quick. I ordered the veggie miso ramen and my bf ordered the spicy miso ramen. The portion size was huge we both couldn't finish. The miso broth was rich and flavourful. The spicy ramen has a real good kick if you like spicy! Definitely will return to try there rice dishes next time."}
{"text":"We come in at around 1345 on a Monday. The shop isn't busy which is pretty nice. I ordered the ika geso and the tonkontsu shoyuu ramen. The ika geso was nicely done, very tender and not overly fried. The ramen was piping hot. The broth was very rich and creamy. The pork was very fatty, just the way I like it. I really enjoyed it even though its the middle of summer. It'll be even better in the middle of our freezing winter. The noodles have good mouth feel and good curls. I wouldn't mind if it had a couple more slices of pork but the amount the garnish provided was sufficient. Everything was on point overall, solid comfort food!

One downside though, we were with our baby but the shop doesn't allow strollers and they don't have a change table. -1 star."}
{"text":"This Japanese place is really cute and nicely set up. Staff are very friendly and gives fast service.This is one of the best Udon in Calgary. We tried their curry udon and chicken udon. They are both equally delicious. They use fish broth for their udon which is nice because it is hard to find without pork base. Also tried their shrimp shumai which is Japanese dumpling. Absolutely delicious from their menu. We could not try any of their ramen as they are all pork broth. Good comfort food."}
{"text":"I've never been another ramen restaurant in Calgary. I felt the ramen here tastes very good, and can compare to ramen in japan. But a dish of seaweed and cucumber tastes awfully sour.. Except for that every other thing is good."}
{"text":"Great little ramen place, the food was great and the service was good. My husband and I got the tonkatsu ramen and it was delicious! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The tonkatsu shoyu ramen is so delicious! I really like the milky yet savory broth of the ramen, and the toppings were fresh and delicious. The softboiled egg is a nice touch. I would give 5/5 stars but unfortunately the pork was dry, and also having to order extra pork to have more than one piece. Still a great place to go if you want to get some ramen, but try Shikiji for some juicy pork toro."}
{"text":"The beef udon is hearty and wonderful.  The veggie tempura rocked my world.  The service was amazing.  The donburi was only so-so but still really good.  I had extra pork and bamboo shoots.  Everything about the experience was amazing.   The best was the ramune soda.   I would have like to have different flavours.  The blacke seaseme icecream cake exclusive to here was teeth rottingly amazing."}
{"text":"This place has great ramen. I would definitely go back. I had the Tonkotsu ramen with extra beef. The broth was flavor and left me going humming, just the right amount of creaminess The restaurant is very cute, reminds me something right out of japan. There is very limited seating, so i suggest getting there before the evening rush starts. The menu is quite helpful for anyone who hasn't had ramen before, as there is plenty of pictures. Definitely give this place a go, won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have tried most of the ramens on the menu and a few of the appetizers. One of my go to spots. Being on a side street in Kensington, it's normally never crazy busy either which is nice. The egg is my favourite here, always soft poached and warm unlike a few other places in the city. The spicy ramen is a favourite!"}
{"text":"A ramen joint that I always come back to. Been here many times and still reliable and good.
Tasty broth and good pork. I recommend the tonkotsu ramen!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious ! II took the japanese curry beef udon. The beef was tender and and the curry soup was exquisite.  I enoyed every piece and udon of that meal. Definitely a place I will visit often and that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great find overall...friendly service, good ramen, and very reasonable prices. We left with a full and happy tummy - would definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"Great spot for ramen on a cold day, or any day.  The broth is flavourful and has depth.  I tried this place over a month ago and forgot to review it...my bad!  There's lots of veggies like bean sprouts, corn, green onions and bamboo shoots.  We tried two varieties and you can taste the difference in the broth.  We had some appetizers as well and those were good.  The noodles were not over cooked and soggy, large quantity of them.  My fav ramen place is in Bellevue, but this is one of the better ones in Calgary.  It's a small place so expect to wait a bit.  The atmosphere is nice with some bold colors to give it a pop."}
{"text":"I had the spicy miso soup and I thought it was lacking flavor. The portion size are generous but the price is a little high (compared to others). Service was great."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen noodles! Great service and delicious food. I love the furniture and ambience. The servers were very helpful. The spicy miso was perfect. The fried gyozas were great too."}
{"text":"The ramen here is sooooooo good!!!! The staff are kind and attentive and the food is so delicious. Not too oily like other ramen places I've been to. The place is a little small but it's still very comfortable. Definitely would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food and service are both good. We had ramen and the noodle are not soggy like some other Japanese restaurant and they don't have to give you dry garlic slices or chili powder to enhance the taste because the soup already quite tasty. Ingredients are fresh an MSG usage is low because we didn't feel dry mouth afterward. If you like ramen you must try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Massively massively superior noodles.

One of the best bowls of udon I have ever had.

(or rather my wife has ever had .... I just got to sample part of hers.)

She did a veggie udon with a miso sauce with a massively excellent broth 

(Blows away any hippie restaurant miso sauce you have ever had)

superlatively individually flavored veggies, and great noodles.

*

Silly me, i had the tempura yams and the octopus balls.

These were quite fine, but not legendary like the udon.

*

The tempura yam slices were about the size of surfboards.

One serving of yam slices is more than enough for lunch ...

for a whole catholic high school, including the teachers.

For those of us used to chintzy servings of tempura - surfboard sized tempura is a clear step in the right direction.

And the execution was  just fine.

*
The octopus balls were fascinating morsels.

(They were not that kind of octopus ball.

No octopus lost his virility in the making of this dish.)

These were chunks of octopus meat dipped in rice flour batter, deep fried and drowned in high quality very large bonito flakes and drizzled in two sauces.

An appetizer i would be happy to have again.

*

But nothing could compare to the quality of the noodles.

Menyatai is a fine establishment."}
{"text":"Co-worker lunch date even thought it was quite warm out. Stopped in during the lunch hour and there were a few other tables but it wasn't to busy. I got the spicy tonkatsu and most other people also opted for a spciy dish, the spicy ramen was quite spicy so keep that in mind but the broth was flavourful and the noodles were decently chewy which is how I like them. The pork was a bit drier than other places (or maybe it was just the piece I got). Overall good ramen, nice atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Noodles seemed to be a bit undercooked but the flavour was amazing. Came here with a client and everyone had a great time. Would come again for sure."}
{"text":"The problem with the ramen scene in Calgary is there isn't enough competition. This gives places like Menyatai an excuse to half-ass the careful technique required for delicious broth. People who think Menyatai is good have no idea what GOOD ramen actually tastes like.

I've been here a few times and every time I'm never satisfied. The first time, they didn't have tonkotsu on their menu. Fast forward a couple years later, they added tonkotsu and I thought it was a good effort. Subsequent times never yielded better results. I tried other flavors - miso, shio. They simply don't use enough pork bones and/or boil their stock long enough for fat and flavors to emulsify. The broth tastes like water, and no matter how fresh the other ingredients are, their flavorless broth sinks their overall score. 

If you want real quality, authentic ramen, go to Muku down the street. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out the ramen scene in Calgary. Unfortunately, Muku was not open for dinner so we settled on this place.
It's a small, cozy restaurant and the service was fantastic! However, this didn't make up for the mediocre ramen my friend and I were served.
We both ordered the Shoyu ramen (which according to the waitress, was less salty than the Shio ramen). This was not true. Our soups were very salty and the noodles were similar to the packaged kinds you could by from T&T. I was incredibly surprised and disappointed because a lot of the reviewers on Yelp said that they found the soup bland.
Overall, not much of a step up from the instant noodle packets you can buy from the store for $1. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"The food tonight was MEH and I just saw them turn customers away 20 minutes before it says they close. Terrible way to run an establishment."}
{"text":"Went for Ramen because of the reviews. Had the curry ramen added extra spice cause I like it hot. Loved it. I want to go back and try the udon cause it's another of my favourites. Will be back."}
{"text":"Watch out Shiki Menya! Menyatai just pressed the 'start' button for a game of Street Fighter 2 with the famous 'Here comes a new challenger!' heading across the screen. That's how I felt about this place after finishing my bowl of ramen.

I ordered the extra BBQ pork on spicy tonkatsu broth with extra noodles. Turned out that I didn't need to pay the extra $2 for noodles because the regular size offers a big portion already. Egg noodles were al dente which was expected. The pork was roasted but tasty. The broth was really good as it was spicy but not overwhelming, and it wasn't salty. I would have liked it more if it was creamier like Marutama's in Vancouver. There were also a half-boiled egg, sprouts, seaweed, corn, and other vegetables in the soup.

While I prefer the charbroiled pork in Shiki Menya, I like Menyatai slightly more only because I find the broth to be less salty. You can't go wrong with going to either of these places. I'm just glad Calgary has at least 2 ramen places that I like."}
{"text":"I've visited a couple of times and tried some noodle soups and sides. Nothing is very special or surprising but it does taste like traditional Japanese foods. and price is really reasonable. I have to compare this store to other Japanese ramen style restaurants and, this place will probably be 2nd or 3rd in Calgary even this place has way more options to pick from. Staffs are friendly and fast service. we'll go back"}
{"text":"I was looking for a lunch spot away from the downtown core of calgary so opted for a leisurely walk to the Kensington part of town for a weekday thursday.

Lunch crowd was in full effect around noon so if you are a single person you can opt to be seated right away at the counter area if not you maybe waiting a bit for a table.

Tried their sesame spinach salad, spicy miso ramen, and their black sesame ice cream cake. Spinach salad was served as a cold dish, a tad salty but good nonetheless, i just mixed it in with my miso ramen to get my vegetable fill for the day. With the spicy miso ramen it just had the right kick of spiciness, I know everyone's spiciness level varies greatly but I thought it was good for what I had in mind. You get a decent portion of ramen, half an egg, mix of scallions and other greens, and one piece of grilled pork in the ramen. I'm not much of a needing a protein person but you may want to opt to pay for and request an additional piece of pork if your the more hearty eater. Black sesame ice cream cake was good but personally didn't wow my tastebuds or anything. Service was courteous and helpful. The waitstaff offered me a apron to wear, in order to protect the white shirt i was wearing at lunch."}
{"text":"I've been dreaming about a hot bowl of delicious ramen for soooooooo long. Seriously, why does Calgary have so many legit ramen places? I call bull. Oh well, just gives me more reason to visit/move here.  I decided to try Menyatai Japanese Ramen for the first time and arrived on a late Friday afternoon. Holy crap, the place was packed and it was well past the lunch rush. Clearly, they know what they're doing. The interior is very Japanese - modern, bright white walls and oozes of friendliness. Even though it was packed, the mood was very serene and enjoyable.

- Seaweed salad ($4.50) -while I waited patiently for my  ramen, I ordered a seaweed salad. It was light, crunchy and refreshing. A nice contrast to the ramen actually.
- Spicy tonkatsu ramen ($12.95) - a rich, flavourful pork broth that made you want to lick the bowl clean. I couldn't stop myself from devouring the whole thing. Ahhhhhh, ramen cravings satisfied. 
This bowl consisted of bean sprouts, a soft boiled egg (done absolutely right, so soft and yolky), green onion, black mushroom, sliced pork, corn and dried seaweed. Let's talk about that sliced pork - holy crap, I wanted more. It was grilled/charred beforehand and wow, was it ever delicious. Melt in your mouth, just the right amount of fat to accompany it. Too bad it was only one slice...

Menyatai is legit. Japanese speaking staff that are super friendly and provide great service. Water was constantly filled. Take a seat at the ramen bar and take it all in. Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"I always have a go-to-bowl whenever I visit specific ramen places in Calgary. It's always going to be guaranteed good. For Menyatai, it is always the spicy egoma. TRY IT!"}
{"text":"The ramen is very good and it's in a good location. It's never swamped with people and we can usually always get a table.  We've tried most of the ramen and udon on the menu and we've enjoyed all of them."}
{"text":"Kensington location. 

Really enjoy the tonkotsu shoyu ramen. 

Can see them making it. 

Friendly staff. 

Clean."}
{"text":"Fairly small place.  Bright inside.  Parking nearby if lucky.  

Had the spicy tonkotsu ramen (with extra pork) and I enjoyed it.  :)  I liked the pork bone soup base,  the charred pork,  one paper of seaweed, and the traditional half a soft boiled egg.  The corn also added some sweetness.   Other things that were in the bowl,  'wood ear' mushroom,  pickled ginger slices....  And that's all I can remember.  Haha.  Overall,  all the ingredients I expect in ramen.  

What needs improvement?  Well I would like it to come out of the kitchen steaming hot.  I would also have liked the pork slices a bit more fatty and also freshly grilled.  

Soup was just the right amount of spicy for me.  For my friend who loooooves spicy food she said she wanted more kick.  

Quite a few selection of ramen."}
{"text":"Took my 9 year old son here and we started with seaweed salad and tempura shrimp. Both were fantastic!  I am happy to report that the broth is not too salty and very flavourful. Too many places use salt as a flavour which often ruins or over powers other flavours. My son loved the pork and we ordered extra slices. Noodles are tasty and not soft and mushy - slightly al dente and the soup is piping hot. Yummmmmy!!!  We will return whenever the mood strikes"}
{"text":"This place was decent. The food came out fast. Girls were friendly. Green tea was good. We were in and out in a normal amount of time which is always a plus.

Only 1 piece of pork though! WTF? Give out two pieces like everyone else. Also there is NO TOFU as an add on! So sad. Tofu is so yummy on ramen. I asked the girl if I could add some to my soup and she said no, so I was kind of bummed about that, but its not the end of the world. 

Tried the spicy miso ramen and some gyoza. The gyoza was pretty standard and the soup was about the same. I would say it was pretty good although I have had better. I don't know what it is about spicy miso that makes it so delicious, but it just tastes so dang good. I could eat it everyday. The price of the ramen isn't too bad either. But like I said this is definitely NOT the best ramen I've ever had in my life. It was decent.

The presentation is absolutely phenomenal. I love the seaweed standing on top of the soup. I also loved the wooden spoon that you use to eat the broth. As well as this the location and ambience of the place is very trendy and cute. The decor was really awesome in my opinion."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I met up with Gerard and it just so happens that he wanted to get together for dinner and I was finally available.  \"What are you feelin'? Where do you wanna go?\" we both ask each other and of course we both respond with an \"I'm up for anything\".  The struggle is real, I personally am pretty indecisive when it comes to places to dine at unless I know I'm dead set on a cuisine.  Ger recently moved in around the Kensington area and said something about hand made ramen - I haven't tried ramen since I moved to Calgary so we headed to Menyatai.

Menyatai is pretty easy to find, located on 12th street NW, it a turn before hitting the core Kensington.  There is a lot of street parking around.  When we entered, I noticed it was quite a small place, the place was full so we wrote our name down and waited a few minutes before we got seated.  Like mentioned above, I never had ramen in Calgary so this was new to me.  They've got other dishes besides ramen like udon, appetizers and mains but apparently known for ramen.

As per always, I go onto Yelp! to view photos and quickly read some reviews to help ease with my decision making process.  I read a lot of \"Get the extra BBQ pork\" so I went with the Curry Ramen with extra BBQ pork.  Ger went with the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen with extra BBQ pork as well.  There were mixed reviews about the curry but I enjoyed it. I really liked the Japanese curry flavored broth, it was really flavorful.  It came with bean sprouts, a soft boiled egg, some bamboo shoots, corn, dried seaweed, of course sliced pork and a heaping of green onions on top, I mixed everything together and had a taste of the alleged handmade noodles and they were delicious, perfectly al dente.  The pork slices were nice and tender to bite.  Ger really enjoyed his spicy tonkotsu ramen, which is pork bone broth.  He has a taste of mine and said he liked his better, I enjoyed his too and will probably order tonkotsu on my next visit.  The one issue I had was with the big wooden spoon, I felt it was awkward to drink soup with it but otherwise I really enjoyed my first ramen experience.  I would recommend trying Menyatai even though Ger said there's another ramen place nearby that is slightly better but was closed when we tried to get in.  Yum yum ramen!"}
{"text":"Great service! Servers were courteous and the food came super fast! The restaurant itself is really cute and clean. 

Their broths are absolutely incredible. We tried two other ramen places in town and this one blows them out of the water. It's neither pretentious not sloppy. They actually marinade, boil, and grill their pork, they don't just boil it, which makes it scrumptious."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this by saying if you're a vegetarian there are really only two things you could order if you want to avoid meat broth (they have no meatless broth options) and the one I had wasn't very good. My other friends got various ramen and 2/3 of them really enjoyed it. They have some untraditional toppings (like corn) that they do not list in the menu, which was off putting to my corn hating companion. My vegetable yakisoba tasted like soy sauce mostly and also didn't really have anything other than noodles and a sparse sprinkling of seaweed. I probably won't return, unless dragged here by my carnivorous friends."}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese udon. This quaint little joint gets busy on a Saturday night but it's worth it if you have to wait. It's flavorful and authentic tasting. There are lots of other tasty bites if you're not in the mood for ramen or udon. Seaweed salad was killer"}
{"text":"Average, the broth and noodle are decent, eggs are a little overcooked. I've had better with the same price"}
{"text":"Amazing ramen, very clean restaurant, great service and surprisingly cheap. It was busy but they have enough of a capacity to accommodate you without a reservation. The broth was tasty, the noodles were perfect but the egg was a little over cooked. Located in Kensington."}
{"text":"Relative to the Calgary-area, this is probably the best ramen you can get within city limits. Pretty cheap - like $11 a bowl. I think the broth is actually made from scratch - at least I wasn't overwhelmed by salt and msg like I am after eating many a bowl of pho. 

As a review below said - stick to the basics on hand because once you deviate from the noodles you get a lot of reheated appetizers and other variances in quality."}
{"text":"I love this place and I think it's one of the beat choices for ramen in town. I must say that Paul's review is spot on so I will try not to repeat too much. I am stuck somewhere between four and five stars because some of the dishes are absolutely amazing and some are OK. However, I appreciate the selection and the process so I'm going to end up at five. 

Please note that this really isn't a vegetarian friendly place as almost everything had pork in it, but I believe there are a couple of options. I don't know how good they would be though, as I have only tried the things with a pork base.

This is a cosy restaurant with not a ton of space, maybe 15 tables total. So just be warned you might have to wait or just take your food to go if you're going on busy night. There is a bar area but that is often full as well. 

I have been a few times and gotten curry ramen, tonkotsu, and the rice dish with pork (the name is escaping me). We have also ordered appetizers of tataki and dumplings. The tonkotsu is absolutely amazing as well as the tataki. Seriously, I can get that every time and be happy. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. The pork, for all of the dishes, is mouth watering, savory, and just falls apart as you're eating it. The other dishes vary in tastiness but it's hard to compare anything to the tonkotsu. 

They are so few pure ramen places in the city that I really think this place is gold. Maybe in Vancouver it would be closer to a four star establishment but I don't know, that really is the best pork bone broth I have had in a very long time. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried the shio ramen, with only salt in the broth. So simple but at the same time amazingly good... Seemed really healthy and was perfectly digestible. So great after a cold day! The service is excellent as well. Took also some sake (half a liter was actually a bit too much for 2 persons). And in total, was not expensive."}
{"text":"--- Food ---
First time trying the ramen here with my partner after reading good reviews. 
I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen while he ordered the Miso ramen. 
The soup base was tasty, ramen noodle texture was a little hard, the chashu pork belly was pretty good as well. The portion size is big - big bowl with tons of noodle. 

My partner and I preferred the ramen at Goro & Gun better. For their ramen noodle softer chewier texture and bigger tastier slice of chashu pork belly. We found the soup a bit bland and needed to sprinkle some shichimi (chilli pepper).

--- Atmosphere ---
The interior design looks really nice! Very modern with Japanese flair. 
The service is average, at times they seemed a little disorganized with the multiple tables they had to service. We were left without a menu for the first 5 minutes until I mentioned it to the waitress. They were friendly though. 

--- Summary ---
I would likely try other ramen shops before coming back to this one again. 
It was a pleasant experience overall and I would try their other ramen choices."}
{"text":"We went to Menyatai to try their ramen and we were a bit disappointed. Mainly because  the broth for all 3 of our ramen lack depth and flavour. The toppings were a bit on the minimal side, especially the meat. The serving portions are pretty generous which might be a positive or a negative depending if you enjoyed your ramen. As for us, it was not too bad, just mediocre.

It's a different story for their appetizers though. We ordered takoyaki, shrimp and pork dumplings(siomai) and tempura and they were all delish! Should have just ordered a double helping of those. But we were there for the ramen.

The service was superb, I would give them 5 stars if the ramen wasn't so lacking. Their servers are very friendly and the food came out quickly and consistently. You have to understand that Menyatai is super busy everytime(you can see the line up outside on weekends). So it's amazing that our drinks were all filled and our needs met through out the whole time. Also, the restaurant is clean and super cute! The ambiance is perfect for friends, family, and lunch dates.

Overall, I would recommend Menyatai for a good lunch date, quick bite, lunch break, and family lunch/brunch. And definitely recommend the appetizers more than the ramen."}
{"text":"4.5/5  for ramen in Calgary.... still not as good as I've had in Vancouver sadly.

I was out with some friends in the fun and cute Kensington area and after a few drinks we decided we needed to soak it up with some food. We ended up here and, as if the powers that be intervened to help prolong our evening, we were lucky enough to walk straight in and get a table for 6 around 8pm. 

For my first time at a new ramen place, I like to get something generic or simple to see if they have the basics down. I ordered a bowl of tonkotsu ramen which has a broth made from pork bones. It came with green onion, corn, seaweed, pork, half an egg, pickled ginger, black mushroom, and bean sprouts. The broth was fairly clean and slightly creamy, a nice change from the often rich and heavy pork broths that you can get. Still, it was rich enough to make it a hearty and filling dish. The pickled ginger also helped balance the dish with a touch of acidity. The broth was simple but had a nice depth of flavour and was well seasoned (not overly salty). The noodles were perfectly cooked with a bit of chew to them. Vegetables were also done well and the bean sprouts added a bit of crunch. The only complaint I have is that for 12.95 you only get one slice of pork.... not enough in my opinion. There are additional pork options but I thought it was a bit of a cash grab. 

The service was happy and efficient but not rushed. The restaurant was cozy, but I was a bit drunk so I didn't really pay attention to the decor or anything..... I DID concentrate a whole bunch on my tasty ramen when I wasn't hacking up lung from laughing and almost choking! 

All in all a keeper and I'll be back to try some of their other ramen offerings! Recommended if your looking for a good bowl of noodle soup to warm you up this winter! Happy slurping ^.^"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen and super quick service! I got to try the crispy shumai (shrimp dumplings) as they were sold out the last time I went and I can see why, they were super tasty. Our ramens came out almost immediately after our appie so we were really happy because we were getting pretty antsy and excited. 

For the portion size, you definitely get your money's worth and I usually bring home leftovers. The broth is not overly salted and you can tell the toppings are also of quality. I usually get the spicy miso ramen which isn't overly spicy in my opinion, but it does have slight kick which I think just makes it extra more flavourful. 

Kensington does have a lot of ramen spots, but I'd say this one is probably my favourite. Staff are super pleasant and attentive and it's really a cute place to check out."}
{"text":"I've been to Menyatai on two seperate occasions, I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and Black Sesame Ice Cream Cake once, and the Curry Udon and the Assorted Tempura the second time. The Spicy Miso Ramen was sufficiently spicy, the soup base was a bit strong and salty, the noodles were chewy but got progressively soggier before my meal was finished (10 mins to completely eat). The slice of pork was cooked/marinated very well, the texture was very good and very tasty. I also ordered the onigiri with my noodles, and it was a huge portion and really tasty. The service was excellent and prompt, the place was very clean and decorated in a cute way. My Curry Udon was good as well, the noodles were chewy (stayed chewy) but the carrot threads in the noodles seemed a little out of place, I took them out and finished my noodles. The soup base for the curry was not spicy at all, it seemed like they took regular curry for rice/dishes and just added water to it, it was not as good as I expected it to be. The tempura was very good, but a bit expensive for such a standard serving size. Overall Menyatai is a nice choice for quick Japanese noodles if you're in the area, because if you try to eat there when they open for the evening (4:30PM~) driving to the area and finding parking is frustrating!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in town. My favourite Ramen in the world comes from Santouka but, these guys come close. Go early and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Probably the Best ramen in calgary.

At this visit I had their curry ramen. The broth was flavourful and not too salty or overbearing, noodles were not overcooked, meat was flavourful and not overcooked. They had an interesting BBQ pork flavour that was different from the rest. Portion sizes are adequate and prices were fair. 

They have a large selection of different flavours of broth that can cater to a large selection of people. 

I Have been to Shikiji, muku, and goro +gun and would say that menyatai was the best bang for my buck in calgary. The place is pretty small so don't be surprised if it's hard to get a table during peak hours. :)"}
