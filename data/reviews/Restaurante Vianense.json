{"text":"Had eaten here many time before and food was good, returned tonight for dinner we ordered bife a casa medium rate, plate came with a mountain of fries, when we finally found the steak it was small and so overdone could not chew it. I've had better steak in a sandwich from coffee trucks. Service was terrible and food even worse. This place has turned into a dive."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, great food, great service, great price, good portions, great wine list(portuguese wines), it's a win, win combination, I've been there quite a few times and the food and service as 
been outstanding every time. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Parking is not easy but the food is good. I would have given ot  4 out of 5 but they didn't they didn't turn on the ac and people were sweating. Some were even fanning themselves. I hope the AC was broken for the not to be turned on."}
