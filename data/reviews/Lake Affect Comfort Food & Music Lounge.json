{"text":"I have always contended that Lake Affect has the best crab rolls in the city, bar none. I don't know what it is about the cooking process, but their Fiery Crab Rolls are just this perfect blend of crunch and melt-in-your-mouth flavour. That was the first dish I tried at Lake Affect, and it's what has kept me coming back.

The restaurant itself is located near the Port Credit Marina (right beside Snug Harbour), and offers a very spartan, simple menu which always tastes great. I usually go for either the fish and chips or a burger, and have never been disappointed. The service can be a bit slow (especially with larger groups), but the wait is usually worth it.

If I had any negative points at all, it's that there's no real non-smoking area on the patio (even if no one's lighting up, you can usually smell smoke from random people standing a short distance away at the nearby supply store), and you still get the same \"old man\" crowd that appears at night to watch the bands.

That said, there are few places better for great food in the village, and I recommend it."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is tucked away near the marina down in Port Credit. I would have never guessed it was there if it wasn't for my friend who's been there before.

Parking was found in the No Frills parking lot.. Shhhhhhh don't tell. lol 
And then we walked through a gate and what seemed like a deserted industrial boat holding area. And in the far corner I saw a patio. 

It was not busy inside as most people were sitting out on the patio. The weather was beautiful and the seagulls were flying about giving this lake side experience some authenticity. My only desire would be that this would overlook the lake but the view was slightly less than that. Parking lot on one side, staff break garbage area on the far end and then a row of beautiful sailboats waiting for the water. 

The menu is small but the food that we got was yummo!! 
We shared nachos (standard, nothing special) and battered haddock fish tacos (AMAZING!!) They had a good crunch and light on the deep fried greasy taste. Tasty guacamole and chipotle sauce partnered each bite deliciously. 

Washed down with a couple domestic beers and we were on our way.

The service a little slow but very friendly and if the sights would have been more desirable this would have been a really great place. But I do give it 3 stars because it has a patio and that's what I was looking for in the first place! :)"}

Lake Affect Patio Bar & Grill is located right by the lake sharing the same parking lot with Port Credit Marina. 

Lake Affect is more a neighbourhood meet up place. Here you will find some home made comfort food, some local talents performance, some local beers!

We came here on a Sunday for Weekend Brunch (11-3) and shared Sugar Dusted French Toast with Banana and Nutella ($13) and down it with a pint of Mad & Noisy's Hops & Bolts. 

Lake Affect's uses locally grown, free range, antibiotic and hormone free meats but our French Toast has not meat... Our French Toast is not bad but nothing too excited.. The exciting part maybe because I am drinking a hoppy beer?!

Service is on and off.. Our waitress was nice enough to warn us about that we might not enjoy our beer selection and offer us a sample. However, when we walked in we were kind of completely ignored till the staff realize we are not going to go anywhere...

Live Music entertaining by Up and Coming local sensation during the Junior Jam Session. Her whole family does have a blast. She is definitely much much better than a lot of Karaoke performances I sat through!

I might come back during summer and sit in the cottage style patio for a drink of a pint or two... and enjoy some lake affect pretending I am in cottage country!"}
