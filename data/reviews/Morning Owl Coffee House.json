{"text":"Awesome, local coffee shop. Really nice, laid back, knowledgeable baristas, that helped me decide on a drink. Great tasting coffee and treats. I didn't stay long, but I noticed board games for those who want to hang out. They carry some cool Ohio apparel and dog treats for patrons that brought their pooch. I absolutely plan on being a repeat customer. I didn't give 5 stars because I think they are still in the start-up phase, but once they get rolling I think this could be a great Munroe Falls staple."}

{"text":"Really nice little place! Came on a Sunday morning around 8:30am. Nice, quiet and the people serving the coffee were pretty cool. The breakfast pastries looked really good but I hadn't eaten any. Next time I stop in I might try them."}
{"text":"My first trip to Morning Owl was a pleasant surprise. Plenty of seating a good place for an afternoon coffee with friends. I had the Brazilian French press my favorite way to enjoy a cup of coffee. Was very good."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop. Great handmade pastries both sweet and savory, selection varies by day. Local and quality coffee, Numi organic teas, home made soup. Airy feeling, reasonable number of electric outlets, good natural light. 16 seats, max, counting the couch as 3. Mix of soft and wood seating. Pleasant staff. As I write this, small coffee is $2.50, medium  $2.75, and large  $3. Top quality, so you get what you pay for. Sure, a mc griddle and a large coffee can be gotten for  $2...but fast food chain ambiance and generic food aren't what cafes are about."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee bar!  It's outside of my neck of the woods but one of my friends was playing a gig there so I travelled down to visit.  Seems like a very comfortable place to chill with friends.  Good coffee though I'm no expert on coffee.  I had the morning Owl, which is a combo of white and dark chocolate with the house coffee in a French press- delicious.  There are lots of baked goods to try.  I had the apple pie which was delicious and generously portioned.  Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped by while passing through, great recommendations and service from the two lovely ladies behind the counter. Great atmosphere with loads of character. Local and import specialty beans and roasts. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I loved my first visit here. The barista was helpful because i couldn't decide what kind of coffee to get, so many local choices! I told him I liked dark coffee so he picked one for me, and it was so rich and delicious. I added a huge chocolate chip cookie to snack on while I sat and did some homework in the quaint, cozy atmosphere. I definitely plan to return, for both the nice work environment and with friends to chat over a delicious cup of coffee. I loved the owl decor everywhere, a place true to it's name. I also thought it was cool that they sell some Ohio merch and also had board games you could get out and play with friends. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy a quality mug of coffee, then stop by and pay them a visit. You have many choices of different styles of coffee all ground at the time of your order. Very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. Don't remember if they have wifi. Excellent pastries as well. Not your typical grab and dash shoppe which is a good thing."}
{"text":"This is a great new shop that nails it on both atmosphere and product! They have a great variety of beans from a range of local roasters to choose from. The baristas were knowledgable and helpful in selecting the right brew and Morning Owl offers every choice as a Pour Over or French Press. I had the India Monsoon Malabar and it was fantastic!   The shop is clean and cozy inside - perfect place to meet & relax for a while with some friends. They offer some mocha & latte type drinks but I didn't try them. This place definitely focuses on good coffee, so if sweet things are your thing you can check them out but are likely to be happier at a Starbucks.  But if you want a great cup of locally roasted Coffee you absolutely need to give this place a try! Will return regularly despite a longer drive!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at the Morning Owl. I had the butterfinger specialty drink today and it was fantastic! More of the coffee taste with a hint of butterfinger which I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Nice eclectic  little coffee shop .  Friendly  wonderful fresh food and desserts  to die for. Great entertainment  last night. Joe the owner  is so sweet and accommodating . . We'll  be  back very soon.."}
{"text":"Very cozy atmosphere and a lot of amazing coffee choices. Also everything they sell is from local companies which I love! Employees are very helpful and polite."}
{"text":"One visit and I think you'll find its hard not to really like this place. The coffee, and there is a great selection, is top quality and made with customer satisfaction in mind. They also have a nice little selection of pastries that all look very good - what I had was extremely good, so I HAD to get seconds. The interior just has a very comfortable feel to it with different seats and a couch for seating and relaxing. We really enjoyed our visit and look forward to coming back very soon. We were treated great, enjoyed the food and the ambiance, and really had a nice time here. Try something different and give them a try."}
{"text":"LOVE their coffee! It's not overly priced and I love their support of other local businesses! Nice family! They remember regulars and it makes you revisit! They are so sweet to my toddler and it keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Very neat little shop. Lots of choices and spacious place to eat your morning goodies and have your favorite drink. Very friendly service and helpful . Will be back for the European pastries"}
{"text":"Sweat pants-wearing, NASCAR-watching, BudLight-slurping humanoids aren't as easily converted to specialty coffee as hipsters and city folk. I'm not judging such fate as a ghastly act of mankind; it's just that in this neck of the woods, we have to take what we can get.   If I was to rate this based on the single pour-over I have tasted from here, it would be a solid five stars. I was highly pleased to find that they had Akron Coffee on bar because Akron Coffee is the new best coffee in the [Akron] area. But it was my first time to try it so I played it safe with a Yirgacheffe pour-over which was said to have a pleasant balance of strawberries, cocoa and cinnamon. And yes, it was wow, quite pleasant indeed. It was very sweet and as it cooled it became increasingly buttery. In fact, the last of it got entirely cold and at that point it became one of the most butteryest, most smoothest, most bestest coffees I've ever slorked. In contrast, I sampled a bit of Oak Grove coffee of forgotten origin brewed via airpot, which was not so pleasant.   They don't do espresso which is understandably a problem for some people. But for me, I find a bit of joy in seeing others as dedicated to high quality drip and filter coffee as I am myself. It's so much simpler that way and that's how these guys operate. A clean well designed coffee house with a simple menu is all anyone has ever needed. It's true. Less I better. Sometimes."}
{"text":"Nice place great to have in munroe falls I enjoyed  my coffee.  They take great care in preparing  each cup. The deserts look very good though I did not try one yet. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This high quality coffee shop is unconventionally amazing! They always have friendly baristas and an extraordinarily rich brew. While they do not serve conventional lattes, they offer your choice of 10-15 freshly delivered and ground roasts. They also offer specialty drinks - coffee brewed with chocolate, white chocolate, or peanut butter. Definitely my favorite in the area. Oh, and I can't forget to mention the fresh local pastries!"}
{"text":"I found this coffee shop after a morning drive from an early doctor's appointment.  GREAT FIND!  This coffee shop features local, Ohio brands and brews of coffee.  On top of that you can see and smell the beans to make your decision.  The best (and worst) part about it is trying to decide what exactly you want!  They have local dark roasts and even a few flavors of decaf.  It's actually a lot of fun!.  It doesn't end with coffee.  They have a wonderful assortment of pastries and sweets.  Around lunchtime their menu adds more choices from soups to sandwiches (I'm actually looking forward to trying their pulled pork the next time!).  After you order and depending on how busy the store is (we arrived when it was early so we were the only people in the store at the time) there is an assortment of antique style kitchen tables to sit at or even a couch set up like a living room which gives this wonderful little coffee shop a homely feel to it!  Overall, GREAT coffee shop with local brews and some nice choices for food.  You can even buy T-shirts with Ohio styled logos on them that you just have to look at for yourself!  The downside?  Well, you will have to bring at LEAST $20 or be prepared to spend a few bucks because you might want another pastry or buy a bag of that coffee you just tried.  You decide, it's worth it!  I am looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Cute place, quiet and good for studying. Good coffee selection with different local roasters featured. Unfortunately they don't do espresso so no lattes, etc. However, a good place for a great cup of coffee (pour over, French press, regular drop).  Staff is very kind and friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 star because I couldn't find anything to complain about. I liked the place... cozy and the coffee was good. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little cozy shop, it has a unique cottage-like feel yet offers a very spacious layout and down to Earth atmosphere. Although pour-over coffee in an incredibly beautiful hand made brass & porcelain strainer might be their main focus, they offer a good selection of Numi Teas. I tried the \"Dry Desert Lime\" & it is easily the first & only time this avid tea drinker has come across lime in any hot tea form.    My husband really enjoyed the freshly made pastries & sandwich he bought, not the  frozen pre-made crap you'd find at Starbucks. This small town shop is truly clean, unique & adorable- can't wait to go back & try their turkey sandwich!"}
{"text":"Just visited for my first time, which is odd since I live in the neighborhood directly behind the cafe, but I digress. The store has a great atmosphere and was warm and cozy when I walked in (it was 3 degrees outside!) thanks mostly to the fire in the fireplace. The lady behind the counter was very friendly, and gave me time to look over the menu since I hadn't visited before. I ordered a large dark chocolate mocha and a bowl of ham and rice soup. The soup was served nice and hot, and tasted fresh. It was really good! The coffee was also quite good, way better than what I normally get at other coffee places. The store was also very clean and had a nice selection of other items available for purchase, like mugs, shirts, etc.   Would definitely recommend, and I'll make it a point to become a regular!"}
{"text":"We love the friendly neighborhood atmosphere and array of coffee type beverages. Now they're serving soup for Fall which is fresh and homemade. Music offerings are sure to please and the owners make sure you feel comfortable. Take the time to stop by...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to find the time to check this local coffee and tea house out and on this gorgeous Spring day in Munroe Falls I was happy to see this local business packed with people sitting drinking coffee and eating pastries. they have soup and scones and muffins and ice cream  I was interested in the Green tea and a blueberry muffin.   Hey have tables to play games that they have . and a table and chairs outside as well.  I look forward to walking in Brust Park and walking over for a tea soon.   ps the blueberry muffin was so full of blueberries so good!"}
{"text":"This is a great shop with a wonderful atmosphere!   I had the French press and it was great.  Only negative is they have no espresso machine.  I hope they add in the future.  That's essential for a coffee shop.  They had live music on Thursday night.  The young guy was pretty awesome.  I also had a bear claw.  It was fresh and delicious.   Being that I seek out coffee shops wherever I travel I have been to a lot and I hope to go back here again soon.  Thank you to the gentleman barista that was very polite and more than helpful as well."}
