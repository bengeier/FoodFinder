{"text":"Since my last review, the place just got better and have maintained their level of customer service, freshness and taste. Perfecto !! :) Gotta try yourself to believe :)"}
{"text":"We were here on June 9th... their 10th day in business... and i can say we are definitely returning the next time we are in town.   We both ordered shwarma platters... were surprised to have a complementary pickle platter delivered to our table.  The pitas were fresh and warm (however, most were whole wheat - i suggest you tell them if you like whole wheat or not -- i don't).  the shwarma was fantastic - a perfect spice blend and clearly their own house blend, it was juicy and perfectly cooked with enough crispy bits.  the rice was perfect, and the side salad was supremely fresh.   the price was fantastic.... two full means, 2 drinks -- 18.97 before tax.  and the portions were excellent.  The restaurant was spotlessly clean - and the kitchen - which was visible from the counter was also spotless."}
{"text":"Me and my friend were here last week, and all I want to say is that the food was perfect, couldnt be better. I got the salmon shish kabob with mushed potatoes and my friend got cabbage rolls with a special souse. The food was so fresh and juicy that I thought it won't fill me, but the portions were great. The restaurant was very clean with an HD TV, and beautiful decorations. I'm planing to there with my family next time, I'm pretty sure they will enjoy it."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this restaurant and I was finally in the area so I decided to give it a try. I got the Chicken shawarma sandwich. 

The pita bread that they use for the sandwich is smaller than other places, but it is thicker. After I got my toppings in the sandwich they literally stuffed it with chicken - which is exactly what I wanted. Most places are a bit stingy when it comes to meat but I was pleasantly surprised that they didn't hold back. 

The employees were extremely kind and we had a conversation with them while our sandwich was being prepared. There is a small sit-down place inside but we took the sandwich to go.

Overall, I will definitely be stopping by here again and recommend this restaurant to friends because of the excellent service, price, and of course - food!"}
{"text":"Delicious. 

I ordered the shawarma salad.  The chicken was right of the spit,  hot,  moist,  and crispy. Salad was great as well. 

It's not the cheapest but that is a good thing,  when shawarma places have too low of prices they go for the volume customer,  which means you also never get freshly made meat.

I just wish the hot sauce was a bit hotter.

I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Amazing. What a hidden gem tucked in the corner of the plaza. 

Everything is so fresh. Chicken is nice and crispy and juicy  you can tell it doesn't sit there all day like other places. 

Make sure you try the hummus and babaganush. 

Friendly service too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Since yelp doesn't allow middling reviews I can't give this place the 3.5 rating I think it merits.

This is a small resto located in a plaza in Vaughan.  The plaza itself looks like a popular hang out for young men after hours judging from the groups loitering and socializing in the parking area after dark.  

We ordered the humus to start and the chicken breast and lamb kebabs for mains.

The humus is not lemony or garlicky but it comes with a drizzle of oil and maybe sumac?  It was a red powder that is a bit sour and sweet and adds a nice flavour to the dip.  Came with a couple of nice warm thick pitas for dipping.

The chicken breast was cooked perfectly so it was still juicy but tender which seems to be a challenge for most restos to get right.  The lamb was a disappointment as it was gristly and tough and had the same sumac flavour to it which was too strong and did not complement the meat IMHO.  Accompanying salad and rice was tasty.

The service was friendly and prompt.  Would drop by if in the hood again."}
{"text":"Last night my daughter and I went for shwarma, food wasn't bad but prices .......rip off. We paid $27 for 2 shwarma plates. And shwarma was good nothing special that I would go back for. Service was ok. She gave me the receipt but only credit card receipt, she didn't give me detailed receipt with items listed. I give it 3 stars for being too expensive and shwarma was nothing to write home about. Would I go back? Nope"}
{"text":"Eye shattering lime green walls, coupled with a TV that plays Spanish soap operas and Shakira music videos.

Seems to be a family-run business. The staff is very kind and respectful. The food is great, and at the end of it all, you get free candy from the bowl at the cheque-out desk.

4/5"}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarma ever! So fresh and delicious. Nice, friendly people who run the restaurant. Must visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, I'm sure a lot of you in Brampton have been to osmows, this is osmows on steroids"}
{"text":"Had the chicken breast sandwich and let's just say that it was the best sandwich I've ever had. The toppings they put in the sandwich were delicious and there were many to choose from. The chicken was marinated and tasty too. Highly recommend you come here!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better chicken shawarma's I've tried in Vaughan. I was skeptical on the type of wrap they used because it was smaller but the thickness made up for it. Overall the shawarma was great. Topping were fresh and the chicken was tasty. Only thing I didn't like to much was the amount of sauce that they included. A little to much. 

Either than that it was great!"}
{"text":"wowwwwwww. all I have to say is wow. I have lived in woodbridge for 16 years, and this is hands down the best shawarma that has ever come our way. My brother and I had this after a heavy gym session and we devoured it! I hope they stick to their roots because they will be seeing a lot more of me! The chicken shawarma sandwich is filling and delicious. The chicken is tender and juicy and theres more chicken than pita ( how it should be) Hits all the right spots ! A must have."}
{"text":"I was hungry and craving falafel, I quickly jumped on yelp and saw that this place had 5 stars. I made the trek over here and I have to say....it is worth every star. The falafel is crisp on the outside and nice and hot on the inside with nice flavouring. Nice mix of toppings to choose from and choice of white or whole wheat pita. The babaganoush(sp?) and the garlic sauce both contain mayo so not an option for vegans like myself. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Read all the reviews, and checked out all the pictures, so we decided to give it a try. As I walked in I thought the decor was plain, an very bright. I had ordered ahead of time. The service was very friendly always smiling and very polite. 

I got home and opened the container and the portions were huge, although I did find the rice a bit bland, the chicken was good, but didn't blow me away. 

It's not a bad place to go, but there are better in the area."}
{"text":"If you're craving shawarma, you have to check this place out! Their chicken shawarma has already been raved about, and rightfully so, juicy, tender, and spices are done just right. I also had the chance to try their lamb kebab and falafel, both of which were also really good, with the flavors and the way they were prepared as well. Makes me think their food is consistently well prepared. You do have the choice of going for a rice bowl if a pita is not your style, but the portion size I thought was more than ample for one person, whichever route you choose to go. The staff seemed really nice, servicing with a smile, although it seemed like it was family owned and run, which explains their friendly attitude. I am definitely making this my go to shawarma spot from now on!"}
