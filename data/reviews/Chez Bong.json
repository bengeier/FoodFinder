{"text":"Food: I've had better Korean food in MTL, worse? that I'm unsure. Despite the colorful presentation, everything was bland, except being salty. What about the typical Korean food aroma and the homey feel like it was mommy's food? euh... lacking? the banchan were NO good and never went to a place where only TWO banchan were offered... so un-Korean T.T

Service: Not very friendly, no smile, no thank you... O__o

Price: actually quite expensive when you think about all the other choices around~

Ambiance: For sure the location is huge success factor here, conveniently located in Chinatown and being the only Korean restaurant in the area... However because it's situated in a basement - no windows (kind of creepy), old cafeteria chairs... not my favorite place for sure~"}
{"text":"Pour le prix impossible de se plaindre. Le service est sympathique. Deux petites entrées et un bibimbap au porc pour 8$."}
{"text":"I went to this Korean restaurant with two friends a few days ago and we didn't remember any dishes we ordered. A restaurant without any memorable food..."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant twice while on business and believe me the second time was not out of choice. Both times I went, neither my friend nor I could finish our dishes because it was so bad. To be specific, we had seafood hot pot, soy bean soup and kimchi soup and they all tasted like water with some seasoning - not unlike what you'd expect a college freshman who's never cooked in his life to be able to whip up from reading a recipe.
Now, I'm Korean and I've had Korean food all my life so I don't agree with this other reviewer who feels this is good authentic Korean food. Maybe authentic enough, but really bad. If this restaurant has such a high rating, that's a sad statement about the state of Korean food in Montreal. I love Montreal, but if you want to try good Korean cuisine, you've really got to visit Toronto where there are two Korean towns."}
{"text":"Passing through town. Craving Korean. Read the reviews. If this is one of the better places in Montreal, I feel sorry for you Montreal. Yikes! I'm Korean and I travel alot. And have to say I was really disappointed. The broth for the soft tofu stew was flavorful but not spicy enough. Had bits of seafood and pork and minimal veggies. Not even a green onion. It was a very poor man's stew. Rice didn't have enough water when they prepared it and was under-cooked and left in the rice cooker to dry out even further. It was the kind of rice my father would say just rolls around in the mouth because it's too hard. Side dish of potato and kimchee was sad. Really? That's all? Was there for an early dinner and no one else was there. Young college age boy was serving and never came by to see if I needed a refill of the meager side dishes. Asked for some crushed red pepper to punch up the stew and the lady in the kitchen asked the server what I did with it. He told her in Korean I added it to the stew. Well duhhhh. What else would I have done with it? I may try the other Korean places next time I come through but I may just hold off on my craving until I get to New York next time. Sorry Montreal. This was a big failure in my book.

Too bad you can't do 1.5 star. The place was relatively clean."}
{"text":"Chez Bong has been around for 8yrs!!!

I've passed by so many times and never even gave it a second look. One night I stopped in front of the window to see what's up...

Eventhough it's a small restaurant, and a bit on the dingy side as are most Chinatown restaurants, it has quite an extensive menu... Like you would see in a small NYC joint or Vegas...

That's when I decided to try it out. Having tried out few Korean places in mtl, I was not expecting much. Korean food in mtl is sorely under represented...

But Bong turned out very well. You only get 3 side dishes here, a bit on the lesser side. Other places usually average 4-7 a couple of places in NYC give u up to 12. 

Although there's only 3, they are all exceptional, marinated potatoes with sesame oil, pickled dicon radish and Kim chee.

We had four dishes, pajeon, short ribs BBQ, beef broth soup and nakgi bokkeum.

By far the best dish in the house is pajeon (korean pancake)!!! crispy on the outside, I think it's the first time I've had crispy paed jun. Inside it's cooked through but soft, not pasty like you get sometimes, in some places, you know, you've had it before... This is the best pajeon I've ever had

The second best dish here is the beef broth soup, wow the broth is very very fragrant, this stuff has been brewed by someone's grandma with lots of time on her hands...The waitress told us it is broth is kept brewing all day until it is served... the flavor is all there, reminds me of Pho...

Korean beef broth soup is an acquired taste, I usually find it too bland, but this place makes it nice. You know the soup is good when you're happy just sipping the broth...oh yeah the soup had dumplings in it too if you were wondering, but really the broth shines.

The nakgi bokkeum (squid in spicy sauce) was disapointing, since it's actually one of my fav korean dish, i was hoping to find go to nakgi bokkeum in mtl, and not have to go to nyc for it. But sadly this one is just a little on the sweet side. And the squid was a bit tough...

The BBQ was good but average, frankly all bbq tastes the same, the ones that stand out are grilled on wood charcoal, which gives it a nice smokey flavor. Sadly this one wasn't grilled on charcoal...

other than that, it's hella cheap and definitely a good eat, and comforting. It's enough to hit the spot when i crave korean, now i don't have to go to nyc and LA for good korean. next up I will try the bibimbap and the jiggae"}
{"text":"Totale déception :(
N'y allez pas pour manger un bon bibimbap coréen, primo pas de choix de viande, 2ndo, pas de viande dans le bol, et tertio l'oeuf cuit par dessus, normalement il est cru non? Mais peut être qu'on n'a pas la même recette
Pour ce qui est du service, on vous rappelle qu'au Québec on parle français Au delà de ça la déco laisse à désirer et la propreté en va de même Pas eu envie de visiter les toilettes du coup.
Bref, si vous voulez manger du bon coréen c'est sur St Denis croisement Sherbrook that's it!"}
{"text":"We came to Montreal for a conference, ate at Chez Bong the first day and then went back the next because it was so much better than anything else we tried while we were there, in Chinatown and in the convention center district. Delicious Bibimbap. Cozy, with nice wood paneling on the walls. Very friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of the most authentic Korean-Chinese restaurants I have been to all my life. If you like Korean-Chinese food, this place is a must try...whether you live in Montreal or just passing by. My wife and I visited three times during our one week stay during the Jazz Festival and will definitely visit again next time we are here! 
The spicy noodle soup is the best ever for hangover~"}
{"text":"I would not go here

Ordered the soft tofu stew with seafood and found it horrendous. 

Kimchi chicken stirfry was expensive and ok

It just wasn't worth going to ."}
{"text":"Being a hard-core Korean, I needed a kimchi fix so I brought 5 colleagues of mine to the restaurant at the end of my conference. The place was dirty, and ill-managed. Perhaps that's because there were a lot of people there at the time and there weren't enough workers to handle the crowd. The food portions were very meager. It's also the first Korean restaurant that charged extra for a bowl of rice that always comes by default if you order soup. Four of my colleagues said the food was okay and one said it was terrible. I though it was decent. What really sucked was that when I asked to split the bill (for reimbursement purposes), the owner appeared very upset and frustrated. To his credit though, he did honor my request. Overall, I don't think the experience was pleasant enough to go back there agian."}
{"text":"The best Korean place i have found in Montreal so far.

Went there 2 times and it was delicious.  Staff is friendly and service is quick.  They have BBQ (but not all you can eat) and all kinds of Korean dish.  The Kimchi is very good.

Too bad, they don't have Hite beers...   Love that Korean beer.  The only thing missing to make it a 5."}
{"text":"Très bon bi bim Bap . Relevé juste à point . Vraiment pas cher . L'ambiance est très chaleureuse . Les serveuses sont très sympathique . J'enlève deux étoiles a cause de la difficulté de communiquer en français ( je connais plus ou moins l'anglais en plus ...) et les toilettes étaient plus ou moins propres"}
{"text":"Very warm and cozy ambiance. It feels like home when I first entered. The server was really nice and the food came pretty fast. The Jap Chae was the star of the three dishes i ordered. It was cooked perfectly and the flavor was superb. Will go back anytime for that. The bibimbap and stir fried pork and kimchi were excellent as well, but lacked the impact that the jap chae gave to me."}
{"text":"Not the finest Korean food I've ever had but certainly quite good! Homemade and down to earth. More like something you would get t a friend's house.  Other reviewers seem unnecessarily critical. Sure, it's not dinner at the Ritz but it's still pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent korean restaurant. I've been here for lunch a couple of times and always leave satisfied. I really like their kalbi dish as it comes on a hot sizzling platter with a bowl of rice and also like to have their spicey calamari dish. They usually give you a soup that's included at lunch. The service is a bit on the slow side especially if you hit this place up on a Thursday/Friday and I've asked for an extra helping of kimchi once (usually the free side dishes) and they charged me for it without notifying me...So I'm giving this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food for the price. 
You either get marinated meat that is really tasty and perfectly cooked, or a stone bowl with sizzling stuff that is a bit spicy and delicious, or a soup that is literally bowling and looked great. 
That restaurant located in a basement offers a great surprise. The bulgogi are simply fantastic. I always end up having that mixed bowl with the egg. And it is good. 
You see, that's what I look for in a restaurant. Authentic food, awesome taste, cheap prices, discoveries. 
Definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"Popped here to this quaint little basement restaurant. Service was a bit of a miss - the waiter kinda felt like he was busying all over and not that attentive and really rushed our order, wanting to swipe the menus back off our hands. Foodwise, was so so, the BBQ beef was quite tasty, the other hot and spicy tofu soup was rather bland and an instant noodle could've been more flavoursome.

The atmosphere is reasonable with the aforementioned wood panels and it would be good to come with friends. Portions were kinda small too and the sides of kimchi etc were put out for all of us to share - we felt cheated out of more here.

Service charge of 15% was automatically added to the bill and appears to be calculated on the post tax amount. Not sure if this is right or custom but there we go. We won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Though I've only been here a handful of times, my friends are seasoned veterans, so I'm extracting a bit from their numerous experiences here to add to this review. 

For a Wednesday night, Chez Bong was still pretty lively. When we arrived, there was no lineup, but there were only two free tables. The interior is cosy, and the decorations are very typical Korean restaurant. One of the key features is the TV on the wall playing Korean music videos. The washrooms could use a bit of work; apparently, the girls' is much better than the guys'.

We ordered japchae (13, I think?) and bulgogi (23), intending to share both plates among the two of us. The potato entree was finished quickly, and we were told that refills are $2, so we ordered another plate. I wasn't a huge fan of the kimchi, but it's never appealed to me in general, so I can't comment much on that. The bulgogi came within 15 minutes, but the japchae took about 30. Service was a bit slow in general, but the owner took off the price of the extra potatoes when we went to pay, and we didn't really mind in the first place. 

Definitely a restaurant that keeps us coming back - in the end, the food is still satisfying and filling."}
{"text":"Chez Bong est la première place où j'ai essayé un bibimpap et depuis, je n'ai jamais été déçue. Une bonne petite place à essayer quand on ne veut pas payer trop cher, mais qu'on veut de la qualité. Le service est impeccable et le personnel sympatique. J'avais également essayé le Jap Chae qui sont des nouilles avec du porc et des légumes. Un bon plat, mais leur spécialité est plus le bibimpap."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best bibimbat, don't look no further you've found the place. In a simple restaurant were service is quick you can taste good Korean food.

The prices are good, and the mood relax.


Ne chercher pas le meilleur bibimbat en ville : vous le trouverez dans ce resto.

Le service est rapide et bon et l'atmosphère relaxe à un prix raisonnable."}
{"text":"Chez Bong is probably the best Korean Restaurant in Montreal in my opinion.  It's always fairly busy inside and they always have K Pop littered on the TV's for your enjoyment.  The service is pretty good and the food is authentic down to the chef and owner who's usually in the back swamped with orders.  It's easy to get a table and your food usually comes out pretty quickly.

I've had a few things here including the bibimbap, soy bean soup, seafood soup, korean bbq dishes and even the soju.  Everything also always comes with a nice selection of side dishes and sometimes they give you free soup as well.  The food is very tasty and on par with some of the best places in Toronto.  I would say the portions are a little smaller than I would like, but the quality definitely makes up for it.

I really enjoy this place and would definitely be back when I'm in the Chinatown area.  It's located downstairs beside the jewelry store, so it's a bit hard to find.  A great find if you're in the Montreal Chinatown area looking for some Korean food!"}
{"text":"I love Chez Bong. At first I thought it was a smoke shop, but it turns out its an underground Korean eatery that serves up some tasty Korean food.

Its on the pricy side, but the quality is consistent and based on how many Koreans eat there, I'd say it's pretty authentic"}
{"text":"Really good bibimpbap probably the best I have tried so far!! Also the tteokbokki is really delicious, very good customer service."}
{"text":"The food here was very good, and I would certainly go back.  I tried the korean-style pancake appetizer, which was delicious, and the bibimbap which didn't disappoint either.

Service was fast; great for a work-week lunch."}
{"text":"Im Korean but i think it is not good Korea food...
Taste is not good especially yukgaejang...
When I ordered the dishes I couldn't endure about the taste an visual....
If someone ask me how chez bong is, i ll not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Un repas vraiment satisfaisant dans ce lieu tranquille du centre-ville. 
On se croirait dans un appartement, invités chez une nouvelle connaissance ou un peu comme dans un resto clandestin. 
La clientèle semble majoritairement asiatique, ce qui est toujours un bon signe. 
Les plats sont parfaits pour ceux qui aiment la convivialité du partage. 
Tout est frais et délicieusement apprêté par une charmante dame. Les portions sont généreuses et le prix abordable.

C'est une bonne entrée en matière pour ceux qui veulent connaître la cuisine coréenne avec les classiques accessibles. 
Une destination idéale hors des sentiers battus pour un repas réconfortant sans prétention."}
{"text":"I LOVE Korean food and this is definitely among my top 3 favorite Korean restaurants in the city.

First of all, the atmosphere is great: it is usually very quiet, most of the time there are only a handful of other customers in the restaurant. So you can relax and take your time eating while having conversations where you don't have to scream to hear each other. The music varies between classical and k-pop depending on the visit, both not very loud.

Secondly, they have the best pajeon in the city. BY FAR. I have to take that every time I visit, even if I'm not that hungry. The portion is huge, the pieces are nicely cut so you can eat them in one bite and don't have to tear all the green onion out, and the ratio of flour vs ingredients is just right. The dough is very chewy, which is not the case in most pajeons I've tasted in Montreal, even though that's part of the definition of a pajeon.

Other items I often take are the soups: kimchi or sundubu jiggae. Very flavourful and the right amount of spicy. The jajjangmein is also very tasty, and only 9$. I would suggest not mixing all the sauce in the noodles at once, because it might be too salty for some. The newly added fried chicken is also among the best I've tasted in town, both the original and the sweet and spicy ones. They tend to have a bit more grease, so that the chicken is not dry at all. The only thing I would not advise is the Gam Ja Tang: it may look good, but there's not enough saltiness or richness at all and the potato chunks are huge, so that the flavour can't get in.

All in all, this restaurant is among the most underrated ones in Montreal, which might be a good thing for regulars since it's always so calm, but it's just so good I had to share :)"}
{"text":"Very basic Korean food but nonetheless excellent. I went there for Bulgogi, pancakes, BBQ and of course the sides dishes. But not worries, you will have plenty of other choices. Moreover, the restaurant feels very familial, very simple and the service was very friendly. Note that I went there on a late weekend afternoon and did not wait long at all. 

I never felt like writing such a straightforward review before and it makes sense to do so for such a simply good spot such as Bong. Perhaps one of the best Korean spots in Montreal after all."}
{"text":"This place has a soft spot in my heart because it was the first Korean restaurant experience I ever had in Montreal. Though it's not completely authentic (My Korean friend told me it wasn't) it's worth trying. I always order their jap chae, kimchi jigae, bibimbap or the meat dishes. The service is always good, the waitresses/waiter are friendly. The decor feels very homey with everything wooden even the walls. It's more expensive than the other restaurants in Chinatown, but not by much. I usually go here to eat when I am in Chinatown, so definitely stop by this place if you don't feel like eating Vietnamese/Chinese food."}
{"text":"PROS:
1. The food is authentic Korean. They provide complimentary banchan (side dishes) whereas 5000 ans does not. I always get one of their stews (totally subjective preference) which never disappoint. If you're a newb to Korean food, I'd suggest the Gamjatang (which everyone usually likes), seafood pancake, Jjajangmyun, bibimbap, or BBQ which are all usual crowd pleasers.

2. The service is by Koreans so you know the food should have that certain taste which I personally find is sometimes lacking with non-Korean owned restos like Bulgogi House. 

3. The decor inside is typical of a small Korean resto with bamboo all over the walls and wood tables. 

OVERALL:
-Great place for Korean downtown at cheap prices.
-I would recommend this place for Korean over 5000 ans or Atti. 
-I give it an A-OK because compared to restos in Korea, I've definitely had better and wait to see a Korean restaurant raise the bar in MTL.

NOTE*: They have a new location on Stanley which I recently visited. Menu choices were very disappointing and I would NOT recommend that particular Chez Bong."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean restaurants that I have eaten in for a long time.  Great food and great service.  Wish that I could return tomorrow."}
{"text":"just discoved this place, maybe because it is a bit hidden since it is not on the main street. 

one of my friend who lived in korea for over 10 years told me that this place offers the most authentic korean dishes. I tasted the jajanmyun (not sure i spell it right...) and it was really tasty. The sauce was thick and dark, just like in the korean dramas, and tasted okay. The bibimbap had a weird taste though... but i like the fact that the bol was not in rock like most korean restaurant so that my rice didnt burn at the bottom, i dont like my rice crispy

The japchae was really flavourful and chewy, the best ive tried so far.

The pork bones soup with rice (i forgot the name of the dish) looks good but tastes bad... it hurts me to leave a bad comment but the broth tasted like water mixed with red pepper flakes and the meat was dry (felt like frozen meat) and didn't come off easily off the bones like it should. 

The place is quiet and theres not a lot of people during lunch. 

One con is that they don't offer as much side dish as the other restaurant. They only gave cubed kimchi and the yellow raddish. 

The place is not bad, so I'll probably come again. They have some korean dishes in theur menu that I have not seen in other restaurants"}
{"text":"Chez Bong, an awesomely small, intimate KBBQ (Korean BBQ) makes me happy. We arrived a little late (1 PM) for our reservation but the place was close to empty, and essentially ours. Wood walls and Korean pop music greeted us.

We ordered KBBQ (prices were average), and selected our meats, then two portable BBQ grills were brought out. Our server (Davina) got us an assortment of marinated meats (chicken, beef, and pork), cooking them on the grills, periodically flipping each morsel over. Onions and pepper slices were placed directly on the grill for us too. The bulgogi was good, not too sweet; everything was delicious. This is leisurely cooking for sure, not crazy-fast.

Wish they had a greater variety of banchan - we received three plates: greens, slaw, and kimchi. Bowls of a slightly-spicy, tangy soup, as well as lettuce, were also brought out. Take-out is offered but we cleaned our plates. Friendly Mrs. Bong Lim Lee, the owner, processed our credit cards.

Chez Bong was a welcome reprieve from a rainy morning. (Heck, we smelled like BBQ when we left. Yum.) Recommended."}
{"text":"Its downstairs so look for the sign

Decent Korean food

I had the Dolsot Bibimbap and Gun Man Doo (fried dumplings)

It was good and a small selection of traditional sides

Hey its just fast food!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! We usually use yelp to find a good place to eat when traveling, but last night we were hungry and didn't have Internet access so we just walked to Chinatown and chose this place at random. It was a very smart choice. The service was excellent, food was delicious, and the price was right.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for an early lunch on a Wed from the convention center. Service was fast, attentive, and friendly. The cook came out to say hello, also, and that made us feel really special. I had been craving stonepot bibimbap, and this hit the spot perfectly (esp for $8.99). I just wish i could come back here and sample more of their offering. My friends enjoyed their bulgogi and green onion/shrimp pancakes. Serving sizes were perfect for no leftovers, and three side dishes were offered."}
{"text":"Not even close to Korean food.  Just because they have Koreans working does not mean its authentic food.  Not enough side dishes. Food was ok. But I guess for Montreal it's fine"}
{"text":"In love with the traditional Korean family dishes at Chez Bong. They taste best in Montreal, especially their Jajangmyeon."}
{"text":"This is the first korean restaurant I've ever tried. In my  opinion, they make the best bibimbap in town. The other dishes are also really good, I've never been deceived coming here. This is the absolute korean restaurant I would recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best korean restaurant I've ever been. Everything is good and they make the best bibimbap in town. This is my go-to place everytime!"}
{"text":"Got their soon tofu and found their cuisine to be quite traditional. The place was quiet and the food was good. Something I missed would be the sweet potato appetizers you sometimes get as a side dish. Overall I would recommend."}
{"text":"Great place, really fast service and always good!
I've been to this korean restaurant a couple of times now and it is aways tasty and lots of flavors! 
The first time I went I wasn't sure about the place because it was in a basement and outside wasn't the prettiest. But once you're inside, you forget about it all. They usually don't do reservation but they told us when to come so we don't have to wait. That was really nice of them, since we were 8.

It's decent price and great portions. Can't say anything wrong about them."}
{"text":"I don't usually post reviews, in fact, I have never posted a review even for any famous four star restaurants. This little place is a hidden gem!  I came here from NYC during my trip to Montreal and I am a Korean, so I am very much spoiled and picky when it comes to dining-outs, especially for Korean or Korean-Chinese food.  I dined here THREE times out of 7 days of my stay in Montreal because the food is unreal!  Firstly, I had Jaengban Chajang Myun (noodle) and Gochu Jabchae, which was heavenly.  On my second visit, I had Chajang Myun/Chambong combo. The Chambong here is probably the best Chambong I ever had in my life!!! The noodle was nicely tangy and the soup was rich and spicy without MSG!!  All the seafood toppings were so fresh!! The most wonderful thing about food here is it's just like home cooking. Unlike the overly Americanized/sweetened New York city's Asian food, they make authentic Korean-Chinese food, just right.  On my third visit today, I ordered Chambong Bab (rice) and Gungjung Dduckboki.  So excited about another best culinary experience!  Will definitely come here again on my next visit in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"My family was looking for a restaurant that served Korean style Chinese when we saw this place listed on Yelp. The restaurant was very close to our restaurant. We came for an early dinner on a Sunday, and the restaurant was practically deserted - which was fine by me. We ordered a dinner combo including black bean noodles, spicy seafood noodles, and sweet and sour pork. In addition, we ordered a fried rice. The food took a little while to be served - maybe 20-25 minutes? We waited quite a while after the pork was brought to us for any of the other dishes to be served. I thought the food was actually pretty decent - a lot better than placed I'd been back home. The seafood noodles, however, didn't taste like the Korean spicy seafood noodles I had always had, I think they used anchovy broth instead of the more usual chicken broth. It was also not very spicy and did not have the salty content that the noodles normally do - but the dish itself didn't taste bad. I really enjoyed the sweet and sour pork - it was probably my favorite out of all the dishes. I would probably come back for another visit if I were in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to chez bong on MANY occasions and it never failed to impress me. The pancake is really good, the beef is to die for and the kimchi entree is really nice!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and it was pretty good. The bulgogi was a little seared which meant it tasted a little bit more like metal that I would have liked. Prices were OK but then even rice was an unexpected add on. Plus we sat right next to a TV blaring k-pop videos the whole time. Overall I wanted to like this place more than I ended up liking it."}
{"text":"When I first arrived in Montreal back in 2014, I was craving for homemade Korean meals. After going through a lot of disappointing Korean restaurants, I finally stumbled upon Chez Bong. 

I was hesitant to try this place as it was in the middle of Chinatown, and I was hoping for a good, traditional Korean meal. This was the first Korean restaurant I liked in Montreal.

So far, I've tried their soft tofu soup (a bit under seasoned), bibimbap, and their jjajangmyeon (Korean-Chinese dish, black bean noodles). Although their soft tofu soup can use more love, their jjajangmyeon is really what won me over. Overall, a solid choice for Korean food in this area!"}
{"text":"Just got back from a glorious lunch at Chez Bong full of sticky, sweet and spicy, peanut-crusted Korean fried chicken and everybody needs to know about it. I'm going to say best fried chicken I've had outside of Nashville, call me crazy. The fried chicken comes in servings for 2, but we had a bunch leftover so I think you could share between 3. We did half regular and have sweet and spicy, loved being able to go back and forth with some banchan in between and taste the flavours in the sauce and the batter, and in whatever that black dipping sauce was (fermented black bean?)

We also shared a kimchi jjigae spicy stew with pork belly, because it was cold and rainy outside (endlessly) and it was the perfect thing. Everything was light and fresh and not over greasy. It was quiet for a Tuesday lunch, classical music playing as we sat alone in the heritage building that houses this unpretentious spot and the staff were warm and friendly and there were tons of other things on the menu I wanted to try. Can't wait to go back. Go support these folks when near Concordia if you like Korean food, or comfort food, or food generally!"}
{"text":"Service good , prepared authentic Korean food with extras . Recommended for a neat dining experience"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Korean food, so when I was walking around Chinatown, couldn't make up my mind what to have and saw this place, my eyes lit up and I went in right away. What a mistake...to begin with, the kimchi was way over fermented, so it was super sour, lacked the aromas that a decent kimchi would have and had the wrong texture. The stir fried dish that I ordered did not taste like a stir fry dish, more like boiled then mixed with the Korean pepper sauce, the flavours weren't mingling like they're supposed to, at all. I reckon that unlike T.o, there aren't many great Korean places in Montreal, but at least some are decent. Not this place though."}
{"text":"It was acceptable. Service was a-ok, taste was a-ok, price was a-ok. I would give it a 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Online said they were opened but went there and it was closed."}
{"text":"Amazing! I had a veggie and caalmari dish and my dining partner had a hot stone bowl filled with rice, veggies and meat. SO delicious and very budget friendly."}
{"text":"When it comes to Korean food, I'm really not hard to please, so I throw 5 stars at them if they meet the major points: food, service, atmosphere.

I was with a group of 8, some of which were Korean food virgins.  Everyone was really happy with their meals.  I ordered the japchae (which was exciting because it isn't always served as a main dish) and while it was a little saucier than some I've had, it was still tasty as heck.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share and they were all very good.  The seafood pancakes were off the hizzay.

The waiting staff were very friendly - our waitress was patient with me when I attempted to order in Korean :) We over-ordered bottles of soju, so I was pleasantly surprised they took one back.  Some places wouldn't do that, I'm sure. 

And the atmosphere was very clean and tidy.  You gotta love the screen of k-pop videos too.  Great dinner conversation piece :)"}
{"text":"It was a long drive from niagara falls to montreal and my sister had to have soju, lol. It was very cozy little place however food was just okay.  We were exhausted and starving from the drive. We enjoyed company of each other but there was a couple of loud young drunks disturbing peace. My mom ordered Jambong, which was quite good. My sister ordered spicy pork stir fry completely soaked in OIL. And i had Sundubu soup, which was not bad. There is potential to be better place as i see it, if they can take constructed criticism."}
{"text":"Two words, Kim Chee. Two more words, Korean BBQ. My husband having lived in Korea for a number of years, nearly fell out his chair when he tried the kim chee. It's the real deal, not the half-marinated napa cabbage they call kim chee in the U.S. My friend that was with us had been craving the self-cook Korean BBQ since the one in her town had closed a few years back. The restaurant is on the outskirts of the Chinese Quarter on a lower level from the street and a bit easy to overlook if you're not looking for it. The interior is unassuming, typical Chinese Quarter decor. There are two BBQ tables and the rest are standard dining table. The service is competent and efficient. The food is very good. We received 3 banchan of pickled julienne radish, kim chee, and a savory marinated potato. We ordered 2 additional dishes of kim chee, it was that good. We even purchased some kim chee to go!

The prices were really good compared to Korean restaurants in the U.S. We will definitely come back to Chez Bong the next time we visit Montreal."}
{"text":"If you are looking for simole cute little place with Korean food, you have just found it. Bibimbap is delicious (you can add or excnage shrimps or tofu for porc or chicken and without egg +tofu it is a great vegan option). Try the tempura vegetables as well, they are listed as appetizer, but are enoigh for a whole meal.
Beer (Tsing Tao or Asahi) is for 6.50 & the have wine and sake as well.
The staff was super sweet & smiling the whole time. I would be happy to come here soon again!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty authentic Korean restaurant, cozy and traditional Korean family decor, cozy ambiance. Just the table was low and the chair was too high which wasn't too comfy.They only offered two banchan, sweet potato and kimchi, both are beyond average. I ordered tofu seafood stew, hot and spicy, tastes pretty good, but the shrimp inside seems to be preserved in refrigerator for a long time...and the other one was stir fried rice cake which had a sweet and spicy taste, and the rice cake was all tender and chewy, good! Just it had some vegetables that don't usually go with rice cake like green pepper, which was a little weird. Moreover, the rice cake was written in the appetizer area but it's more expensive than a main dish...and they don't have too many choices on the menu"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere for a basement restaurant, and not at all what I expected. Ordered their bibimbap and it was absolutely wonderful. A bottle of Soju was the perfect side. 

Very friendly service and great prices are sure to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal last summer, me and a buddy of mine came across this almost tucked away jewel of a spot. I remember it was hot that day; their air conditioner was so refreshing as were the ice cold Tsingtao beers we started off with.

Me being a grass fed animal, I ordered a Tofu and veggie Dolsot Bibimbap which was simply amazing. The kitchen had no problem modifying my order with Tofu. To sum it all up, it was prepared to perfection.

Staff and atmosphere was very nice. The place was clean and the service was fleet. I would highly recommend this spot to anybody looking for a Korean restaurant in the Chinatown area."}
{"text":"korean style chinese restaurant. I was looking for this kind of korean style chinese restaurant and it perfectly lived up to my expectation. Jjajangmyun and tangsuyuk was really good!"}
{"text":"J'ai pris un soontofu et mon ami un jajiamien pas mal , l'accueil est chaleureux mais dommage l'endroit est vieux"}
{"text":"I'll give four stars for this restaurent. 

The service is slow but they make it good. I work right next to this place. I came often with my boss for a dinner. 

If you know Korea's food then you know how they make it. We tried lot of dishes. Special the boneless chicken. Really good. Also the fried chicken with peanut sauce. Or half peanut half spicy."}
{"text":"Me and two of my friends came to eat here on a Thursday night. Service was quick and professional. The staff was really nice, and were smiling and kind! I love the condiments especially the potatoes. The prices are affordable. We had ordered the regular sizzling beef bulgogi, served with rice on the side. I love when it came sizzling hot to my table, but I believe the beef was already overcooked. Unfortunately, it was very tough to eat. 
I would come back, but maybe just to try out the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"the food is alright. I have kimchi stew, nothing special. I prefer Mon Ami over this"}
{"text":"Great little spot with delicious food and friendly service. Although their sundubu is not as spicy as I'm used to, their potato salad served as banchan is delicious. This is a perfect spot to have a lunch with colleagues or friends. Definitely will be back there again!"}
{"text":"If this place could have a location where I live I would be there every day. I have never had korean food that was this good. We kinda ordered a lot of food but it was so good. My stomach is growling currently thinking about the delicious prawns we had. It's a tad hard to find they have a small space but find it and go!!"}
{"text":"It's a big place where you could come in with a group and the ambiance is comfortable and quiet, but the decoration and maintainance needs some work... I've only tried one plate, the black bean noodles and it was good, I noticed the menu had photos in it so you could actually \"see\" what you order, but didn't see any description in English or french, which would have been nice. Overall a good place to enjoy good korean Chinese food."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a little restaurant that's kind of hidden but you can't miss the banner outside. It's kind of underground so be careful going down the steps (especially in the winter). The inside gives you the classic homey, family-owned restaurant vibe. 

FOOD: I really liked their bulgogi bibimbap. It had just the right amount of seasoning and the portion size was bigger than I expected! Very tasty. The glass noodle dish was decent as well. Their little appetizers consist of kimchi and potatoes although I wasn't a big fan of their kimchi... 

PRICE: Pretty good price for a Korean restaurant. From what I remember, I'd say the meals were around 11-15$. 

SERVICE: Their service was very good. The staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Korean food, and have it a lot. Here, I gave it an average rating. The staff is friendly, and the space is pretty nice. Food is okay, because we had better ones. The seafood sun tofu soup barely has any seafood, seriously. The flavor is fine, but it's almost just plain tofu soup. Same for the seafood pancake - very little seafood. But I have to say, the pancake is very well cooked - soft inside and crunchy outside. I think it would be better just to be a little more generous with the ingredients, even if that has to drive the price up a little bit."}
{"text":"Very good quality and taste! Stopped here for dinner on a Sunday night. Ordered the Jap Chae, Dumpling Appetizer and Bulgogi ti share between my husband and I. The traditional side dishes were more then enough to fill-us-up, the jap chae was just right, the bulgogi was the most succulent, tender and easy to eat beef I've had in a Korean restaurant in a LONG time... Well done! We tipped this family heavily for the excellent service!"}
