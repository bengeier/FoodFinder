{"text":"I just moved into my new apartment in the area and called for a take out order. The place had received good reviews so I thought \"Why not?\" I was hung up on twice before I could even get my order out. We were finally able to place an order and told 5-10 minutes. We live 15 minutes from this restaurant and we left immediately after placing the order. Ten minutes later, my phone rings and it is the man who took our order telling me that he was closed and would not wait for us to get there to pick up our food because he had told us 5-10 minutes. If you are going to order from here, please make sure you stick to their timelines. And if you do go to pick it up and make it there in time, it is very hard to find."}
{"text":"Try the crab Rangoon, it's fantastic also if you spend 25 you can get a free order of sweet and sour chicken, best Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered from here because Uncle Chen, our go-to takeout place down the road, was closed.   I ordered the General Tso tofu, a favorite dish of mine, and hubby ordered the beef Mei Fun noodles. We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.  The food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.  So, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great. If you're looking for a quick fix to your Chinese food craving, this is a good place to order from, although I'll be going back to Uncle Chen before I try China Sea again."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I almost did not place an order - but very glad I gave China Sea a chance though! As it was Christmas night, there were limited options for delivery in our neighborhood. We called China Sea and unlike what some folks experienced the woman who took our order was friendly and polite- even wishing me a Merry Christmas. Delivery was promised in 45 min and arrived right on time. Our order was pretty basic: chicken fried rice, pork lo mein and some egg rolls.  Food arrived hot and was very tasty. Not greasy or too salty at all.  For the price, the portions are very generous.  Definitely would order from China Sea again."}
{"text":"i love china seas we order a lot love their sweet and sour chicen and their General Tso chicken they will mke it to your wants i cant eat spicy food but my son loves it so they will adjust it to your liking eggroll  are good woman that anwered the phone was very nice my food always arrives hot  love you china seas!"}
{"text":"For your run-of-the-mill Chinese place, China Sea does pretty well for itself. The food is good, and the people are very nice. The prices are reasonable, and I like that if you order over a certain amount, you can get something free with a coupon (listed on their site). They always say 45 min for delivery, but I've never had to wait more than 25-30 min."}
{"text":"In regards to Chinese delivery, China Sea is the best option around. We have yet to have a bad experience with them. The food is pretty good, and much better than House of Lee! My husband loves China Sea, whereas I would rather order pizza :)"}
{"text":"Whether you live in Ben Avon Heights, Brighton Heights - or anywhere in between - I urge you to try China Sea.  It is quite simply the best local Chinese delivery.  The people on the phone are helpful and friendly.  The delivery is always quoted at 45 minutes, yet the food always arrives earlier and is always unbelievably hot and fresh.  Some favorites of ours are the Kung Pao shrimp, pork lo mein and hot and sour soup.  I don't mean to compare China Sea to the higher end Chinese restaurants in our area.  It is not Sesame Inn or China Palace; it is not a \"date night out\" sort of place. It most definitely is a cozy, inexpensive, good quality \"stay in and relax\" go to.  Hope this helps!  Enjoy!  ps A few final thoughts while we were going back for seconds; they only use all white meat chicken in their dishes. pps Always look at their online coupons, you will get something free!"}
{"text":"The shrimp fried rice was orange and only had some onion pieces in it and some carrots and peas that were burnt in it.  There were no eggs or sprouts or anything I would expect in fried rice and there was a random piece of pork in it so I threw it out.  My shrimp egg roll was good though.  It had large deveined shrimp and I was happy about that.  That's why I gave it two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Delivery is slow and not even close to the best Chinese in the area.  No matter if it's rice or noodles or chicken or pork, everything tastes off--like it's been overcooked in mop-bucket-water.  Try House of Lee instead."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick dinner and not wanting to go out you turn to the menus you accumulate.  Some are good, some not so, but lucky for us China Sea was a good choice.    The menu is your typical Chinese fare that you would expect from any other place.  Ordering was fairly easy over the phone.  Even though I did forget to order an item.  When I called back it was no biggie to them, they just added the item.    When the food arrived it was piping hot and smelled very good.  I had my old reliable, General Tso's, which was leaning more onto the spicy side, which I like.  Also had an order of the fried wontons.  Both were cooked amazingly and made my belly happy.  The helpings seem bigger than other places, so much so that I had enough left over for another meal.  Delivery was quick and painless.  If you pay by card they will bring the slip to you to sign.  I encourage tipping."}
{"text":"Good standard American Chinese food. Easy to order over the phone, and they are happy to take credit cards over the phone, though there is a $10 minimum to use a card. There General Tsos is good, crispy, and not too sweet. Good fried rice and egg rolls, too. There only thing I've had that I wasn't crazy about were the crab Rangoon, but the fried wontons make a solid stand in. It's not gourmet by any means, and I preferred the food when I worked in the area and could dine in...delivery is never my favorite as it just never stays totally crispy. But, it's a great price, usually quick, and pretty good food, so I'll continue to order from there."}
{"text":"The pros: You get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent, this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS.  They have coupons on their website that you can use whenever.    The cons: The woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. You try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time.  My pork dumplings were \"fried\" only on one side and were raw in the middle.  Everything was pretty darn salty. Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty.  Leftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough!   If you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?"}
