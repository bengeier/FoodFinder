{"text":"Been here a few times. Always had the fish soup noodles. The food is very average. The service is quick. Noodles comes with a after drink and the price is not too bad. There is lot more to eat except noodles."}
{"text":"This used to be my fave casual noodle place.  But since the master if the best hk style milk tea left,  she was replaced by a lady with a big attitude, which is all about the business and nothing about the customers. The \"tea\" she makes can be characterize by an unmixed combo of water and milk, with barely any taste of tea, light years away from the previous thumbs-up tea.  Food is the same for now,  but don't know for how's much longer that would home out.  Seems like it has undergone a subtle change of management.  Hainan Chivken Rice is ALWAYS out. Noodles, minestrone and pork chop rice continue to be good. But this place has lost its soul."}
{"text":"Another hot pot restaurant opened replacing the previous Hong Kong Style Cafe Delicious Seafood and Steak http://www.yelp.ca/biz/delicious-seafood-and-steak-markham ?! But prefect for the cold winter months!  The must order item at Chung Hing is of course anything that uses fish soup as soup base!  Fishy, Sweet and Creamy Fish Soup that suppose to be good or your health without any MSG.   The combination bowl of goodness that you can pick the carb, protein and soup base for $7.99 that includes a drink. Or if you are really hungry, all you can eat hot pot for $17.99 that you can upgrade your soup base to fish soup for $2 extra!   Pro Tip: For drink, I strongly recommend ordering the HK Style Milk Tea. The lady that making the drink here had won the 2014 International Kam Cha Hong Kong Milk Tea Competition for Toronto pandoraangeliquelee.word... . The milk tea here is so smooth and delicious. A gentler version than Marathon Cafe."}
{"text":"I came here with the girlfriend for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  I Ordered a Soup Noodle with fish broth (very flavourful).  She ordered the Hainanese Chicken on rice, we also ordered the Garlic Butter Abalone appetizer, and shredded chicken with jellyfish appetizer.  $4.99 for one abalone, and it was delicious, almost wish I had ordered another one.  The shredded chicken with jellyfish was avg, I wouldn't say it tasted bad, but it's not overwhelming that I'd brag about it, however I would order it again.  Everything was pretty good overall, but service I'd say was excellent, maybe because the owner was there, but staff was very willing to assist, and had a good attitude.  3.5 for the food, plus .5 for the service"}
