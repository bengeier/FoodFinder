{"text":"I am a Huge fan of chopped and was so excited to try this restaurant! I do believe that it will improve with time and fine tuning, if Scott Conant  takes reviews and criticism, in the same spirit he dishes it out on TV! Our waitress was enthusiastic but woefully inexperienced. It doesn't help that she takes the orders but doesn't deliver anything.  Our appetizers were so oily, we would have sent them back, but she never returned to ask and we were too hungry to wait.  The spinach pizza would have been great if the entire crust wasn't soaked in oil! The Octopus and rapini was soaked in oil as well. I didn't received the parmigiano cheese  nor lemon for my water,  that I asked for several times!   My husband's main course was the Lamb Shank. The lamb itself was cooked well But the couscous it was served with floated in the gravy that was too soupy and Tasted too strongly of black olive. The saving grace was my pasta entre, the pacceri  (pasta tubes with lamb ragu)! Tasted exactly like my Mother's homemade sauce and the pasta was light and pillowy! I will return for this alone.  The final insult was the bar order. The JWB scotch on the rocks my husband ordered was not even an ounce. He ordered the next one straight up and poored it over the same ice, finally a full shot! However when received the bill he was charged and additional $3 over the in the rocks price! WTH? The waitress could not explain the descrepency and said she must have entered it wrong, but did not correct it.  For now I would recommend you head 2 blocks down to North Italia, also homemade, better value and service!"}
{"text":"I'm sure there will be a lot of 5 stars because Scott Conant was there. I went thinking this will be a great experience and love watching chopped. Unfortunately this experience was not good at all. We did the tasting menu. First off, it's a great amount of food and gives you a variety of items. The first few courses were decent. Raw tuna on undressed butter lettuce was weird, polenta was amazing, octopus was above average, kale salad was good, 2 bread dishes were ok. Left you with the  ok what's next feeling. Disaster hit when our pastas arrived. Both pastas were well undercooked. Squid ink pasta was edible but had a raw pasta taste and texture. Pomodoro was inedible. Im shocked it was even served. How did the chef plating it not notice the texture?? We obviously didn't eat that course and we then waited over a half hour for our main. That's after we had already been there for 2 hours. Asked for dessert to go because simply, after 3 hours, we wanted to go.   Tables are very close together. On two occasions I witnessed people having to help move their table so  someone could get out from the bench seat. Now to the worst part.... the icing on the cake was our server. When we first arrived, it took 15 mins for him to great us. He walked up and said do you know what you want? We quickly ordered and barely saw him. Other servers/food runners were very attentive. He dropped our bill off and walked away before I could tell him there was a comp from the casino. We had to explain it 3 times, which took another 20 minutes. Two tables next to us had comps and they didn't have issues. He finally returned and barked \"you're good, it's taken care of\" and walked off. No copy of the bill no thank you. Nothing."}
{"text":"Food and service are just so so given all the hypes prior to Masso Osteria opening inside Red Rock Casino Resort.  It replaced the previous Salute Restaurant.  Prices are not too overly expensive but seems high.   We ordered the creamy polenta and grilled octopus for appetizers and lamb shank as main dish.  They did a better job with the small plates.  We had to send the lamb shank back because the cous cous was so awfully salty.  The kitchen replaced the cous cous but did not reheat the lamb shank.  Not sure if this was an oversight or the way chef wants the lamb shank to be eaten.  The radicchio and pea vines combo were also very tough and not tender at all.  The manager dropped by and asked about the cous cous but didn't apologize.   We probably will give it another try given the restaurant is newly open and probably still working out its kinks, and furthermore Red Rock Casino Resort is one of our favorite destination."}
{"text":"WHAT AN AMAZING PLACE!!!  My son was diagnosed with severe seafood allergies and it's so hard for us to go to restaurants.  He can't eat seafood (fin and shell) and can't smell fish which affects his lungs.    We had a reservation at 5:30pm on the soft opening.  As soon as we came in, they sat us at our table and our waiter automatically asked who had the seafood allergy.  He then explained the menu and showed us which dishes was safe for my son to have.  There were 7 in our party and we had an amazing time.  From the cocktails, to appetizers, main course, side dishes, and desserts, we all enjoyed every dish we tasted.  Our girls devoured the cheesecake dessert.  We had staffs that always checked on us and made sure we were okay.  We can't wait to come back for more and knowing that they took good care of my son and for once, he didn't feel left out and was very happy with his dish.  I wish there's more restaurants that are allergy friendly like Masso Osteria......."}
{"text":"I lived in Italy for years, I know good, bad & Great  Italian food. This  place was mediocre at best. Service was just ok. Food was not bad but Not good either, & I will say Extremely overpriced!!$15.00 for a Tomato Salad for real?  It's lettuce, basil, & small amount of burrata cheese (Basically a soft/creamy mozzarella) & some dressing, shouldn't be more than 11 or $12.00. Who does this guy think he is??  Don't even get me started on the pasta prices OMG!!! Tagliatelle with a bolognese & fonduta $23.00 for a pasta dish with sauce & melted cheese  I don't care of the pasta is \"house made\" um that's how it SUPPOSE to prepared in an AUTHENTICO RISTORANTE ITALIANO\" unless you are  \"Pizzeria Pastaria\"--- A cheap chain restaurant in Italy.  I am sooooooo sick of these pseudo-celebrityChefs who have egos larger than their bank accounts that real the need to rip their patrons off.  I have no problem paying for a great meal and exceptional service (like Lotus of Siam \"amazing food good service or Echo & Rig phenomenal service good food)  I do however have a problem with places like this that feel the need to overcharge for mediocre food.  If your rent is so high in the Red Rock open up a ristorante in a local shopping center & price accordingly.   Like my Italian friends always say \"you want good Italian food cook at home\""}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place. Excellent.. no absolutely fabulous services all through.. from the front hostess to servers.. everyone is #1. The food is great.. the seating is awesome.  We particularly liked this place as we had a particularly bad experience at another restaurant - Bottiglia in Green Valley Ranch.  Do not go to Bottiglia, especially if you have the wrong skin color.  Go to Masso Osteria... you will have a great experience."}
{"text":"Had a really nice meal out on their front patio while visiting with an old friend there in town.  We split a few appetizers, then each had our own meal.  The house-made Stromboli starter was filled with salami and mozzarella and served with three dipping sauces (the best of which was the garlic, followed by the pesto).  It was more of a round (loaf) shaped bread than your typical oblong style...but the filling to bread ratio was just about right.  The zucchini fritti dish was made up of thinly sliced zucchini lightly battered and fried, then served with a spicy sauce (similar to a bloomin' onion sauce).  The delicate wafers still had some \"meat\" to them and the batter made for just a hint of crispness.  It paired really well with the spicy sauce.  For my main meal I ordered their signature pasta dish, the pasta al pomodoro.  It was served with a thick (al dente) style spaghetti and a sauce similar to a vodka sauce but with slightly more tomato incorporated.  It was a really hearty plate, served a la carte.  Between the lovely weather that evening and a pretty solid meal...we both had a great time.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Seated promptly. Ordered the Focaccia bread for starters and it was just OK. Ordered a bottle of wine which was good. Both my wife and I ordered the  Veal Milanese which turned out to be way overcooked. It was dry and almost burnt. Our waiter sent the manager over who promptly took it back to the kitchen and reordered it. The second time around it was good but not terrific. I've had much better. We passed on the dessert. We used to frequent the place when it was called Terra Rosa. We are locals. We tried it when it was called Salute and it was terrible. Obviously others thought the same way and it closed.   End of the day....it was just OK...most likely we won't be going back. There are too many other Italian restaurants in the area that are much better - like Mastrionni's."}
{"text":"Chef Scott is simply genius. Every bite was perfect. Every dish was a piece of art. Branzino melt in your mouth. Little addition of tomato sauce makes a huge difference.  Clams casino perfect. Beef tartar with little hint of parmesan.. wow  Tiramisu,  unusual and simply delicious.  Our waiter Edward made the whole experience even better. Highly recommend him Overall, the best dinner me and my husband had in months."}
{"text":"It took 45-60 minutes to receive the food so that was a big Debbie downer. I also made the mistake of ordering just the kale salad assuming it was entree style but it wasn't, it was definitely a side salad for $15 so when our waitress said that's it? I should have listened. The cheesecake and recco garlic bread were worth every penny but I'm not leaving full because of the salad which is disappointing. Love the chef though and hope to return when I feel like big spending again."}
{"text":"We just might have a new favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas. Masso Osteria was simply fantastic. Everything from the bread to the dessert was first class.   We started with the house made focaccia, which comes with a garlic parmesan spread. I could've killed about 4 loaves of that by myself. Next, we had the zucchini fritti with Calabrian peppers. The zucchini was sliced thin and the peppers added a really nice kick. For my entree, I had the tagliatelle with bolognese and fonduta. Without a doubt, one of the best pasta dishes and maybe one of the best entrees I've ever had. It was just that good. For dessert we tried the pear crostata with créme fraîche gelato. That was the perfect light dessert after the heavy pasta dish.   I cannot say enough good things about this place. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"We went there last night.  After explaining to our waiter about how we would like our food prepared, (such as no extra pepper on anything during the cooking process, because we have dietary concerns) he asked us if we would like any wine or other alcoholic drink.  When we told him we do not drink alcohol he asked, \"why\"?  That's right.  \"Why\"?  While I will never apologize for not ordering any liquor, I told him point blank that I do not drink because I simply do not enjoy the taste of alcohol.  Plain and simple.  So right off the bat we got off to a bad start. The tomato salad was fresh and very good but it arrived along with the beet salad which I assumed was to be served warm or hot since it is listed on the menu under \"wood fired sides\".  It arrived cold. Why it is listed under this category I haven't a clue.  The beets had a combo of arugula and red onions on top that were so salty that I just removed the entire amount on put it on an empty bread plate.  The beets tasted just fine but they were supposed to come with pistachios.  My idea of pistachios is that you can see visible amounts of pistachio pieces. Instead , I took out my magnifying glass and saw tiny, tiny dots of pistachios (pistachios is plural so I will guess they used at least two pistachios to make this dish) that I assume were crushed by the tires of a 747 and then handed over to a chef's helper where he counted out the amount of granules he would put on each beet.  Before our main course came out the waiter starts to clear away the table and removes the yogurt for the beets even though we aren't done eating the beets as well as the bread plates.  I told the waiter that I was considering getting more bread so he said he would bring us more.  This is the free bread that the restaurant doles out only if you ask for it.  We may have exceeded our allotment of free bread.  The waiter brought us more bread and more bread plates and said that he just got this out of the oven.  It must have been an \"easy-bake\" oven because the bread was as cold as the first batch he brought.  My wife's main course of grilled salmon was very ordinary accompanied by  rubbery mushrooms.  I got the paccheri pasta dish that was perfectly al dente but as you got down to the bottom got saltier and saltier.  Apparently the chef may have over compensated the lack of pepper with adding more salt. Finally, we got our check and paid the waiter with points we accumulated from the slot club.  When he brought us our receipt he reminded us that the total of points used...\"DID NOT INCLUDE THE TIP\".  Thank you Mr. waiter.  Not only did he correctly guess that I was born yesterday but that I had never eaten out in a restaurant before.  Aside from all the unintended insults hurled our way I still tipped the waiter 20%."}
{"text":"Awesome 2nd chance. Thank you to the staff and Rudy for a fantastic experience and the food was excellent too!"}
{"text":"I took my hot African queen here fo a special balentines dinna! This food was du BOMB !!! I gots me da $120 steak and it was so good I wanted to order another one. The manager Ashley came over and was Suppa friendly and made us feel very welcomed. If you wanna be suppa fly and a p I m p like me take yo hottie to dis place"}
{"text":"We originally had a negative experience here, but we contacted the organization through their website, and they were very attentive and apologetic about our issues and invited us back to make it up to us.  The food was amazing and the service was excellent.  Definitely happy to give a place a second chance, and it was well worth returning for the experience and the food."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.   Went with my boyfriend the other night.  Aside from the good happy hour,  this place is overpriced and underwhelming.   Limited menu;  we had a pasta dish that was way too al dente,  (also small portion for $22??) fish was slightly undercooked.   This is a local casino yet the restaurant is charging strip prices.   If you want to charge Strip prices then move to the strip.   Save your money.   It's not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Not gluten free friendly.. very restrictive menu not allot of choices.. why  they choose a corn base with brown rice pasta for us gluten free people is ugly it falls apart not good at all.. needles to say we will not be coming back not even a gluten free pizza crust. mom had the antipasto salad which was tasty. The Recco style garlic bread my guest enjoyed."}
{"text":"We stay at Red Rock a lot and were looking forward to trying the new Italian restaurant that just opened. Being a big foodie and food network fan, we were delighted to try Scott Conant's new restaurant. Started with the clams casino, really really tasty you have to try if your a clam fan.  We also started with the focaccia bread and polenta.  The bread was good so was the polenta but it seemed more like cheese soup then polenta. I told them they need to call it a dip rather then polenta, it did not have the corn flavor you taste with polenta.  The main dishes we had were the Tagliatelle Bolognese, a very good Ragu!! The gnocchi was excellent, it was a little dense but oh so tasty!!!  For dessert we had heaven on a spoon, OMG the Salted Caramel Budino was one of the best desserts we have ever had!!! Very light and good to share, love the crunchy gianduja crumble.  Can't wait to eat there again. Very good service to boot and a beautiful interior"}
{"text":"We ate at Chef Conant's Mosso Osteria for the first time last night. Here's three take aways:  1. Same delicious food from Chef Conant at more affordable prices. A+ 2. The breads, pastas, and desserts are all made in house.  3. We had a wonderful meal made even better by passionate and enthusiastic team members  We had the Recco Style Garlic Bread to start. One team member in an Italian accent enthusiastically explained that the cheese in the garlic bread is imported from Italy and comes from the milk of cattle after having walked a great distance in the alpine mountains yielding cheese that is very creamy with high fat and acidity. It felt like a scene from the TV show Portlandia, but in an exciting way it added so much meaning to the dish which was absolutely delicious. The bread was the consistency of Indian Naan and had the aforementioned imported cheese tucked between it's layers and topped with fried garlic shavings. This is a must try. The best.   Second to come out was Zucchini Fritti. Very thinly sliced zucchini is battered, fried till crispy, and served like chips. Tossed with mint and chilies, this dish was light and flavorful. Amazing. Also a must try.   Chef Conant's Signature dish is \"Spaghetti\" crafted with a technique to elevate 4 very simple ingredients (tomatoes, garlic, red chili flakes, fresh basil) into a flavor dense and ultra creamy sauce. Our server recommended the Pasta al Pormodoro saying it's the same recipe just called by a different name. After trying it, I do believe the pasta is different and I didn't get any heat from red chili, But if I hadn't had the original to compare it to I wouldn't have known the difference. Still a world class pasta. I will order this over and over again.   Vegetarians, order all the dishes I just mentioned. You will not be disappointed.   My husband ordered the Tagliatelle with bolognese & fonduta which he was really happy with. He says he will come back for more.   The table next to us ordered the Wood Roasted Chicken. They liked it a lot and said the secret to the flavor was a dry rub.   We had a great experience at Masso with great food and great service. It's so nice to have world class restaurants such as this off the strip and easily available to Las Vegas locals."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Service and organization NOT good at all!   The servers and managers did not care that you were there. I called 2 weeks after it opened to make a reservation and stated it was 2 Birthdays and one anniversary.  I also mentioned to the hostess also upon arrival about this.  We had 2 different waiters without telling us. They forgot about these celebrations, no acknowledgment at all.    I got the impression that this place was very swanky and they only cared about who was seated inside the restaurant not on the patio.  We are locals and I would not recommend this restaurant at all!!!"}
{"text":"Very good service. Started with rosemary focaccia and octopus. Octopus was delicious, their house made focaccia did not have much rosemary flavor.  Entree - Sea bass is excellent, lamb shank not as good, but replaced it with squid ink pasta which was great, although pasta could have been cooked a bit longer. I love pasta al dente , but this pasta  needed a bit more cooking. Over all I did enjoy it, will come back to try other food here, hopefully it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Ate here with wife and kids on 3/3/18 (Saturday).   Ambiance: 4 stars; Very nice space - well lit but a little loud as the tables are tight together.   Service: 5 stars; Staff is very attentive and friendly.  Constantly clearing used dishes and refilling drinks. They automatically bring you extra silverware when you order appetizers which is a welcome touch so you don't have to constantly be asking.   Wine list: 5 stars; Wide range of selections by the glass and reasonably priced for a casino restaurant. They have a \"sommelier selection\" section which allows you to sample a more-expensive wine at an affordable price (I'm assuming it's a Coravin system).   Starters: 5 stars; Ordered the garlic bread, focaccia, polenta and meatballs. The bread is fantastic - well-seasoned and fresh. There is no free bread here but that doesn't bother me - I'll pay for bread this good especially when you get three different dipping sauces on the side (caponata, kale pesto and olive oil with garlic and Parmesan.  All were delicious.) The polenta is so creamy and is infused with a wonderful bacony-smokiness. Meatballs are sausage-style which I really enjoy but is not the wife's favorite. Either way they were very tender and flavorful.   Entrees/sides: 4 stars; I ordered the squid ink rigatoni, wife ordered the tagliatelle with meat sauce and kids each ordered a pizza. Rigatoni lacked seasoning and overall flavor. Usually squid ink noodles have that ocean brininess that enhances the seafood flavor - these noodles had none of that which is a little odd as the server did confirm that all pasta noodles are made in-house.  There is a good amount of lump crab in the dish and the fried Anaheim chilies are a nice touch but it was just lacking something.  I felt the same way about the tagliatelle - again the house-made noodles are good (aren't they always?) but the dish was just lacking salt and overall flavor.  The pizzas, however, were both delicious - crisp crust edges, excellent quality toppings and very flavorful.  The pizza with the poached egg on top is not to be missed!  Also ordered the brussels sprouts on the side along with the marble potatoes.  Sprouts were very good - nice and tender but not soggy with fried shallots on top.  Kids loved the potatoes - they're smashed and then fried which makes for a nice textural contrast between a crispy outside and creamy inside.  Desserts: 5 stars; Wife and I shared the caramel budino - again not to be missed with a perfect balance of sweet and salty.  I could have eaten five more of these (and I was full from the meal).  Intangibles: Chef Conant was in the kitchen and also walking around the dining room checking in with the diners.  It's nice to see him giving personal attention to a new restaurant in the suburbs.  OVERALL: 4.5 STARS; a very good value based on food quality (our bill was $200 before tip ($160 food + $40 beverages).  Portions are just the right size.  I really hope this restaurant is successful as it would show that the Las Vegas valley is growing up to the point that a nationally-recognized chef feels comfortable opening a location off of the strip."}
{"text":"Celebrity Chef Scott Conant  Had to check it out and so glad we did. They have a garlic cheesy bread, Recco, they say its like an italian quesadilla. My son couldnt get enough of it.   Tartare of Beef was amazing. I dont like beef but wow i absolutely loved this!!!  Creamy polenta was recommended and thought it was a bit too creamy for me, my son loved it so that says alot. Wood Roasted octopus was definitely different. Not bad, but maybe not something i would order again.  Pasta al pomodoro, a staple item, 5 stars!! It was light, full of flavor and a simple dish made to perfection. Squid ink rigatoni definite must try especially for those seafood lovera out there.    Fish...i found my new favorite fish dish Roasted Sea Bream. So delicious, i didnt share haha!   Service was top notch. GM Rudy was so friendly and welcoming. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It's so refreshing to have the super friendly atmosphere with great food . Michael at the wine bar gave amazing suggestions and it didn't break the bank. Having the chef walk around threw out the night was a great touch. Looking forward to going back and having the squid again"}
{"text":"Very cute and clean place. I like the oldies playlist while we are and that our table was overlooking the fountain. The food was good but the service was phenomenal! Lauren (Lady Gaga!) was so friendly and helpful and made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Stellar evening from start to finish as we celebrated my girlfriend's birthday. Ambience - intimate, quiet, and inviting. Our waiter Tyler was super attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, how things were cooked and prepared. Asked if we had any food allergies. Noted that we didn't care for a lot of grease, mayo, and butter. Food was catered to our palletes. Water glasses were never empty. We opted for the \"5 - course tasting menu.\" If you're looking to have options and variety, I would recommend it, for $65 per person, it surpassed my expectations. Food was light with robust flavors. Another plus that this restaurant was nowhere near The Strip. This is a new local spot for us. Thank you Chef Scott Conant for making our evening a memorable one!"}
{"text":"Slightly disappointed. 3 wines on their wine list were not available the evening we went in for dinner. The food we ordered was just o.k. The Ceasar salad to start we can't even give it that. Our server was the best part of our experience. We had expected much more."}
{"text":"Masso Osteria located in the Red Rock Hotel & Casino in the Heart Of Summerlin. (Previous Location of Salute)  FYI : Chefs Menu Available for $65 a person   I give Masso Osteria 3 1/2 Stars    The food was good nothing overly spectacular.  there were a couple of things that stood out for us than others.  The pasta we ordered was by far my favorite . (Tagliatelle) I also ordered the lamb which was not bad at all fell right off the bone , I enjoyed the tenderness of the meat however I didn't necessarily care for the flavor of the juice surrounding the cus cus it came with.   The Short Rib gnocchi was great and the salmon was delicious.   The garlic bread was just ok it wasn't too rich but more just a little dry like it needed marinara or some type of sauce to eat with with out getting tired of eating it.   The main issue that i have and I'm not sure if it has to do with the Venue itself because I experienced the same issue with the service when the last company occupied the space. Even if the servers are on their job it always seems like they take an overwhelmingly long amount of time to bring drinks from the bar , check to the table etc. on multiple occasions at this venue I've notice the servers having maybe more of a work load than they can take on and if that's not the case the drinks at the bar are not or have not been a priority. I hate to complain I really hate to . But management needs to get this issue dialed in . This location is too convenient for me not to come back ! 15 mins with an empty beer is just way too long and every time my drink was empty it took 15 mins and an apology no exaggeration. Attention Management let's resolve this issue so i can come and spend more money with you guys ! By the time desert came my espresso was gone. (I like to eat my dessert with a nice espresso to top it off) . I understand the objective of trying to give a 5 Star fine dining experience however this place is either understaffed or the servers are not able to be attentive enough in order to provide the service a 5 Star establishment requires . I will definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"So, all the hype about Scott's new place, big fan, we had to go, Easter Sunday...the bar is adorable, the bartenders are super cutting edge with amazing new drinks! The limoncello martini was bomb!!! The happy hour cab was very smooth!! The dinner however.... I hate to say I was so disappointed! The atmosphere was awesome!!! Super chill and cute and just lovely decor! The food was not so great, everything lacked flavor, even the Margherita Pizza! How can you go wrong with pizza? The $65 veal chop had a side of raw dandelion greens that were inedible! The homemade Gnodi was something I could pick up at Trader Joe's, not something at a new Italian restaurant. I had sea bass that was rubbed in tomato and it was not anything to write home about, totally lacked flavor! The pricing was pretty high and the food certainly didn't match! I was expecting fresh, yummy, exciting and totally wont be going back! North Italy was what I was expecting.... this was so not what I would pair with Scott Conant! Bummed!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant.  We visit Red Rock quite frequently and were excited for this restaurant to open. The staff is friendly but food was disappointing.  The most in-expensive bottle of Pinot noir was $150! The sea bass had a red sauce on it ( very strange), and you have to pay for bread.  The Caesar salad was salty.  The spaghetti was the best part of the dinner.  I think we'll  stick with T-Bones."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.  First they gave us the wrong cocktails before dinner then our salads showed up 10 mins apart then they totally forgot our celebration request even after reminding them 3 times!  Then the server just disappeared and another guy showed up???    All in all the service was terrible and I give the food a B-.  Won't go back..."}
{"text":"The best food from the garlic bread, amazing meatballs, salad, chicken, pasta and dessert. We will return."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Chef Scott Conant on the Food Network. He constantly demonstrates that he knows his stuff...which is why we decided to try this place.  Conant does show that he can be a bit of a prick on Chopped, which may be why his waitstaff try too hard. Their trying too hard results in this place being frenetic and frenzied....to the point of overkill.  We had 5:00 reservations and showed up at 4:45. The hostess told us that we would be seated at 5:00. Wife decided to use the restroom, so I walked out with her, she did her thing, we walked back in at 4:55. Everybody else who had showed up early were now seated. Not a lot of people, but they sat us in almost in the center of the restaurant. We should have asked for a better table, but we had a direct view of the kitchen which was pretty cool.  The waitstaff are friendly...and, there are so many of them. We had our waiter, multiple servers, the guy who popped out with the pepper grinder a minute before we needed him...we asked him to come back, which he never did. Two random dudes, one with a sportscoat, jeans and tennies and another with a pompadour that would have made James Brown jealous.    We had someone stop by our table about every 4 or 5 minutes. Too many. Too much. Too often.   The food was GREAT.  (I have to add that even with all of the staff, food took a while to get to us.)  Appetizers Creamy Polenta. Seriously amazing Classic Meatball - fair Antipasto Salad - Awesome. Dressed perfectly  Dinner Wife - Cedar Roasted Sea Bass. WIfe is still talking about this. That good. Me - Tagliatelle. Some of the best Pasta I've ever had.  ...and a couple glasses of wine. Their wine selection is top notch.  We'll be back...we'll wait for them to thin out the zoo first."}
{"text":"My family was so excited to try this beautiful new restaurant.  My husband, kids and I came tonight around 7 for dinner. We were sat at a round table closest to the casino hostess entrance. The waiter came over and he said can i take your order. I ordered a pizza for my kids with just cheeses. He said to me like I was so dumb. \"You mean the margaritae pizza?\"  I said well I don't want basil or tomatoes on it. He's like\"well that's what that is. The basil is in the sauce. \". He said it so extremely rude. I was so taken a back by his rude attitude. I have never been here before. I don't know the menu. Just thought he was a jerk to me and will never return here again because of the way he talk to me. Not impressed.  Will go somewhere else next time just because of the rude waiter. Just his tone was so rude. Never been treated so rudely before by a waiter"}
{"text":"Summerlinians across the land are going to be forever grateful for the newly opened Masso at Red Rock Hotel & Casino! Not only can they now gossip about the newest celebrity chef cooking down the street from their abode but the food and service at Masso will live up to their \"oh my gawd, let me tell you about the fabulous dinner I had\" tales at the water cooler on Monday.  There are only a handful of dining establishments that do \"Italian proper\" in Las Vegas and I can proudly say Chef Scott delivers here.  Our meal started with being sat in the corner which normally I would be offended since my name isn't Baby, but the venue was absolutely packed so I was just stoked to get a seat.  Normally I would be very weary of a brand new restaurant being so full with eager customers as we had a movie to catch in 90 minutes, but the service and food timing was perfect so we didn't have to rush on any of the  courses.  Our server was incredibly knowledgeable regarding the menu and offered fantastic suggestions. We started with the Tuna Crudo, the Kale Salad, the Polenta and the Octopus.  All four were strong offerings and I would order each again.  The Tuna has a good dose of heat. The Kale was seasoned to perfection. The Polenta....ah mi amor. I would write a book on that if I could but it would mostly be made up of drool and caloric dirty thoughts. The octopus was incredibly tender and spot on.  For entrees we ordered the massive veal parmigiana to share and our guest ordered the regular veal chop.  The veal parmigiana had a great presentation as they paired the giant Barney Rubble type chop with a cute arugula salad that paired well. Each crunchy bite combined with the healthy dollops of burrata created a velvety pleasure that one should not live without.    Word of mouth alone does not do this meal justice. You have to try it for yourself as you would be doing your stomach a disservice by not imbibing on the cocktails (and reasonably priced wine list) and tickling your gastronomy bones as you inhale the perfectly cooked veal parmigiana.  Great job from top to bottom. Can't wait to come back and bring my tooth brush so I can brush my teeth with the polenta 'cause it's that damn good."}
{"text":"Its a wonder why chef Scott is not an Iron Chef. His food is super tasty. Everything from his signature pasta to the veal parm. Words can't express how great this restaurant is. The average rating does not do this restaurant justice. Its a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and the service is spot on.  I had the pasta and our friend had the veal. He found it ok and very pricey   My pasta was good with a little kick."}
{"text":"This newly opened restaurant serves great fare and is quite the gem for the Redrocks Casino. We were especially impressed with our server, Luis. He was courteous, friendly, efficient, paid attention to detail and contributed to a most wonderful meal experience. I would recommend you ask for him, however, please don't on the night we return, he's ours. ;-)"}
{"text":"Went to check this place out after all the hype had died down. Overall, all the food was good, and the ambiance was relaxing.  We had the chefs tasting menu, and it was fun as well giving us a wide sampling of what acclaimed chef Scott had to offer. Our server was exciting and engaging with conversations about various topics. The only hiccup was my wife, and I had drink issues. First, my wife's drink glass was dirty and had lip marks from inadequate washing/polishing. My drink also came out with a bug in it. Now they did promptly replace the drinks, but this might show an inattention to detail.  We found this surprising with such a big name behind the restaurant. I also was hoping that they would have comped the drinks, but that did not happen. A couple of Franklins later, we left, uncertain if we will return."}
{"text":"Great meal! Our sever Lauren was spectacular and the food was outstanding. The wine selection was large and quite delicious."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Italian restaurant in Vegas!!! The creamy polenta was AMAZING!!! Not to mention the staff and quality of service I received. I literally felt like I was in a family oriented environment! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"They still have a lot of  kinks to work out. We waited FOREVER once we ordered a bottle of wine, seeing the waiter pass by several times. Then we waited FOREVER for the food.  I had the gnocchi and it was just \"ok.\" Another person in our party had the chicken and it was lukewarm at best, although tasty. And the third person had the meatball appetizer and she said the three meatballs had no flavor. The wait staff was apologetic and attentive and the manager did give us desserts \"on the house\" for our excessive wait time, which was a nice gesture.  One pet peeve of mine is that this place charges for bread. And $4 for four tiny pieces of focaccia bread  that were over salted was disappointing. In an Italian restaurant that just shouldn't be!!  If the food was amazing, we might be tempted to try this restaurant again, but honestly it was just so-so."}
{"text":"I been to several of these celebrity chef's restaurants. A friend heard about Masso on a commercial and she was excited to go.  Unfortunately the experience was not what we expected. We ordered garlic bread but it tasted like salt. We returned it twice.  The put salty cheese in the middle and it was like a stuffed pizza.  You couldn't even taste any garlic.  There should have called salty cheese pizza bread,no sauce.  Then they gave use 4 little pieces  of hard bread in a box. And a little olive with a lot of parsley.  We both order fish, which was bland.  One fish platter came in a metal serving plate.  It was self serve and I burnt my arm twice trying to get the fish on my plate.  Although the service was ok I would never go back again."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for Al Freso dining weather to visit Masso. The outdoor patio has the same great atmosphere when it was Salute. The  backgound  music of modern and old standards worked well with the fountains and waterfalls. They also retained the same comfortable chairs.  Our server Jason was friendly and efficient. He checked on our satisfaction throughout and water glasses were refilled by an associate.   Dinner consisted of  Wood Roasted Prawns Wood Roasted Chicken Wood Roasted Sea Bream Side order of Fingerling Potatoes  The Prawns appetizer consisted of 3 large pieces over a bed of cous cous and calabrian chili butter. This was an ample portion. The prawns were juicy and the tails were removed in the kitchen. The cous cous was melt in your mouth.  The 2 large chicken breasts were cooked to perfection, tender and juicy with lemon, served with roasted carrots and onions.  The 2 filets of sea bream, served on a bed of greens with lemon. The fish was light and flaky.  A side order of fingerling potatoes with skins on had a touch of garlic. The portion was large enough to take some home along with some chicken.   No room for desert, but there is always next time."}
{"text":"Great Food and excellent service.  Music was much too loud for me. A bit pricey but that was expected."}
{"text":"Went opening night and didn't get a seat but made a reservation for Sunday.  The polenta was the best I've ever had. Ordered potato gnocchi and it was delicious. Chef Scott was there and it was an fabulous experience, he was very humble and made time to talk to everyone.  Great night!"}
{"text":"Opening Night was amazing! My husband & I got to enjoy our Valentines Day dinner at Masso tonight. We had the most superb service & excellent food! From the silverware swaps to the explanation of the menu to the ambiance & presentation/quality of the food, it was a 5 star experience as you would expect! Scott, the chef (chopped tv star), also came out to meet everyone & was very friendly! Our server was Australian & very knowledgeable about the chef's dishes as he had worked with him for many years. He was attentive & friendly & made sure we loved everything!   We shared the Focaccia with 4 dipping sauces, clams casino w/bone marrow, beets w/ pistachio/mint/yougurt, polenta w/bacon/truffles, cedar roasted seabass w/tomato sauce & homemade pasta pomodoro    They were all fabulous dishes & the pasta was highly recommended by the server & we could tell why! The Seabass was so creamy & delicious!   Can't wait to go back to try the chef's choice menu option when it is available!"}
{"text":"We went here for my dad's 80 bday.  We were regulars at Salute (which was the prior italian eatery.  The chef here must have a great sense of humor.  The Tagliatelle was the worst I've ever had.  The Seabass was incredibly taste, which is hard to do with a seabags.  It was cooked on a plank. The rest of the food with the exception of the polenta (was very good) was bland and just simply not up to par.  we will not be going there again.  It's a total FAIL!"}
{"text":"Reminded me of a strip restaurant.  Service seemed to be standoffish unless they expected you to buy the house.  Wasn't too crowded but still \"a wait.\" Food is abut $3-4 too expensive, as are drinks. But as all the Conant restaurants I've been to, the food is great.  We had the cheese gnodi, the infamous spaghetti, the brussel sprouts, and the focaccia bread.  Bread was not free which is always disappointing, but for $4 I was surprised to come out of the purchase saying the bread was worth the purchase.  It came with three dipping sauces of pesto, parmesan oil, and eggplant. Very nice starter.  The brussel sprouts were pretty pour.  Too thick and undercooked.  The pastas were both quite good in preparation and taste.  Spaghetti was as good as you'll get at Scarpetta.  The gnodi was a beautiful plate with oozing cheese when you cut through it.  Very good dish and filling for sure.  The meal was good but not sure it's cracked the top 5 Italian in Vegas."}
{"text":"Heard about Scott Conant's new Italian place that just opened inside red rock casino, so went by last Saturday to check it out with a friend. We didn't have a reservation and found out it'd take an hour to get a table, but there's one high top table that's open by the bar (these tables are on first come first serve basis). We started with drinks (I like it!). I had a bourbon based cocktail called lalna, while my friend had a summerlin spritz.  We then moved on to appetizers by ordering the creamy polenta with bacon on the side (my friend doesn't eat bacon) and the wood roasted octopus. The octopus was tender and quite tasty. The polenta was very creamy and had good flavor, but felt more like a side dish to me. For entrees, I ordered the lamb shank and my friend ordered the grilled salmon. Overall, all the dishes we ordered tasted good, but had no wow factors. Very average and not any better than most Italian restaurants. Considering the price point, I'm a little bit disappointed.   Service was not great. We didn't have our water refilled at all during our entire dinner. Our server was friendly and stopped by right after the dishes came out to ask how they were, but then didn't do anything else?! I was tempted to walk down to the water station and just took a pitcher myself. My friend finally had to flag some other server walking by, so we could get some more water. I get that they're busy, but we were there for a while, so I don't understand how difficult it was to pay better attention to your assigned tables.   Anyway, been there done that. It's a pass for me."}
{"text":"Updated review: So I left a review and they told me to email them so I did and they said please tell us what was wrong with your meal in the email. I already did tell you what was wrong here. I dont need to email it to you when it clearly says here how bad the meal was. A real manager would have said please come in and we will give you a $25 gift card to rectify how bad your experience was. Place had no clue what they're doing.   I was so excited to come here because I am a huge Scott fan and I am a Chef myself. So me and my GF came here. Sat down and we ordered the garlic bread with the cheese appetizer and it wasnt anything great. We ordered 2 drinks, my GF got some whiskey drink and i got a Masso Mojito, her drink was ok, my drink literally tasted like mouth wash and it had no alcohol in it at all. So we ordered the Beef tartare and the Polento with bacon, truffle and mushrooms. Honestly the Beef Tartare was was amazing 10 out of 10. The polento came out and my girlfriend thought it was vomit, it was super waterly and had no flavor. There was absolutely no truffle in there at all. We told the waitress and she said let me get you another one, the second one was worse than the first one, no flavor and no truffle. For an entree she got the gnocchi and i got the squid ink pasta. Her gnocchi was overcooked and had no salt on it, flavorless and the clams were so fishy it was making her gag. My blackink pasta was one of the worst bowls of pastas I've ever had. Also there was a group of 4 women next to us and they were screaming and cursing loud as hell. Obviously they don't goto nice restaurants very often because they had no manners and the waitress did nothing about it. Im sorry chef Scott but this was very disappointing. I dont understand why people go so crazy over a restaurant because a famous chef has made the menu. He isn't even there to run the kitchen and obviously the Chef there and the line there can't execute how the dishes were supposed to taste like. I would deft like to try again maybe in a frw months."}
{"text":"Amazing Amazing This quality food for this price point is absolutely incredible.. Ok must have  Meatball  the best I have ever had Garlic bread is excellent  Pasta ALL homemade  Creamy polenta  Please have the salted Carmel dessert .. Very good wine list the general manger was new he was very helpfully. To Top of dinner the Chef Emily came to the table . With a collie flower  Creation that was incredible. Again this place is very affordable this is absolutely a must. Thinking about going back there tonight and I'm not kidding"}
{"text":"This place is located in a residential section of las Vegas in the city of Summerlin.  Unlike the other celebrity chefs that have their restaurants in a high busy traffic area of the Blvd that simply relies on tourism,  this place relies on word of mouth,  quality,  humanity and everything that great chefs believes and endorse.  I guess you can attribute many of these logical qualities based on the chefs personal family heritage.  If you are looking for a great Gem that serves all natural foods that comes from hard working farmers in our great nation and not some laboratories designed by Monsanv, this is your place.  I lost mother to pancreatic cancer and I will never settle for mediocrity.  Thanks to Scott and his great staff for meeting our expectations."}
{"text":"We went on Valentine's Day for the soft opening. They seemed to still be working out the kinks with the service and timing of the food. The taste of the food and the presentation more than made up for the service. I can't wait to go back and have the pasta pomodoro again. Best pasta I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware. Just went in for happy hour (which is just drinks right now). The menu offered wine, beer and a daily cocktail. The bartender said the wines were merlot and pinot grigio, the beer was a lager, and \"we have a nice peach martini.\" We ordered the martinis and when the bill came they were full price. When we asked why they weren't the happy hour price she said it was because the daily cocktail was a lemon drop. And here's where my jaw dropped. You know you implied the peach martini was the daily cocktail. I still tipped because I'm not a complete jerk, but this is NOT the impression you want to make as a new place. We're still sad that Salute closed...was hoping you'd be a new favorite."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here since it opened recently. I have tried chef Conant's restaurants in the Cosmo and was exited he opened a place off of the strip. Located in Red Rock Casino Masso Osteria is easily accessible and you don't even have to enter the casino. A perfect night we opted for a table outside. Know for his pasta dishes we split the two of them to start the meal and then had some main courses and dessert. - Potato Gnocchi served with clams(out of shell) guanciale and tomato. Gnocchi were perfect, light pillows of dough. I would have enjoyed them more with another sauce. The clams were still gritty and that made this dish not so appealing. - Paccheri Large tube like pasta with a neapolitan meat ragu & caciocavollo cheese. This was the right dish to order. Ragu had perfect amount of tender meat and tomato sauce with a generous amount of the cheese. I am definitely going back for this dish!! -wood roasted chicken. This was another dish that had potential but just May have been executed wrong. Expecting the skin to be crispy we were disappointed that it came out chewy in texture. Flavors were good and the mixed vegetables were a nice side but the skin should have had that crispness from the wood fired oven -The D.O.C.G pizette was topped with fonduta, truffles & poached egg. Thin and crispy, the dough was perfect and a poached egg on pizza, yes I was all in on this one. Very rich flavor, almost like a buttery taste, I enjoyed this pizza. - Salted Caramel Budino. A custard like dish with a hazelnut crumble and fresh whipped cream with one of the best salted caramels I have tasted. This dessert was an excellent way to end the meal I will definitely be back and will concentrate primarily on the pasta courses."}
{"text":"We went Friday night for dinner at 8pm a group of seven. We were seated at 815p and at 830p we got up and left.  No one had come to our table except one waiter who took one persons drink order and left.   We were pretty ticked off but as we left the restaurant a manager came running after us apologizing and really begging us to come back and give them a chance. I honestly was very impressed by this and we decided we would.   She got us a really nice and friendly waitress and they brought us out some appetizers on the house and bought our first round of drinks.   The positives were the place has a great feel and looks amazing. Manager was very attentive and we appreciated the efforts she made to get us back.   Food was actually very good but portion sizes were small for the prices. I understand we are in Summerlin but I would suggest lowering prices or increasing the portion sizes. We really liked the beet side, garlic bread  and gnocchi. The sea bass was also very good.   I think there is a lot of promise here but service kinks need to be worked out it seemed confused and we noticed others having some service issues. I guess this is too be expected when a place is new but the owner has multiple restaurants so this really should not be an issue.   I have it a three star rating just based on service issues and value for what you pay. I think they will have to step up their game to compete in the Summerlin food scene as there are so many great places within 10 minutes of this restaurant.   We really wanted to like it a lot more and we will probably go back at some point but I think we will let them work out the issues."}
{"text":"The food is excellent the service not so much whatsoever.  The manager looked like she was 15yrs old! (not very professional when approached) I may or may not return. I should have listened to an acquaintance who said that the service was not stellar. Hopefully someone from their establishment will take these reviews seriously. In Las Vegas it's not just about fine cuisine.  It's about great service as well."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this experience, and my disappointment was stimulated early as I checked into my reservation 5 min early.  The hostess was terrible.  Allowed me to sit for 20 min and actually sat another party that came in after my party.  'She forgot\"  FAIL.  Once seated, the server did a great job and was attentive.   The octopus appetizer was nice, but not spectacular.   Our party was torn with their selections 30% felt the dish was good, but 70% felt it wasn't worth the price and was similar to Olive Garden.  I was a regular ar Salute and miss the menu, managers and wait staff.  Overall I will not return and will ensure my sales team are not allowed to entertain here.   They are a long way to go to greatness."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new place to discover and try out and cane across this new Italian restaurant in Summerlin at the Red Rock Hotel and Casino Resort.  First impression was amazing.  We're supposed to only stay for an hour ended up having a 3 hour dinner because we ended up trying the Chef's tasting menu.  We feel that this was all worth it.  Everything came out delicious and had a bottle of wine to pair it up with.  We will definitely be back again for more.  Thank you for opening so close to my home in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"It's good but not that good that they're charging way toooo much for a small portion of food . This is a local restaurant at a local resort and casino . We won't be back"}
{"text":"A little pricey for what you get portion wise but I had some of the best pasta I've had in a long time here. The wait staff was super friendly and accommodating. Of all the restaurants at Red Rock Resort, I would recommend this one first. I had the Tagliatelle, tomato salad and focaccia appetizer. The salad was a tad disappointing but everything else made up for it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service is outstanding. Lots of appetizers and shareable dishes. Only here 3 nights and we are going back before we leave! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Reservation at 6:45 pm. We arrived around 6:30 and checked in. We went to the bar for a drink which was fine. Around 6:50 pm, the bartender over heard our conversation and went to the host to ask why we hadn't been seated. He came back and said we would be seated soon. During all of this time, there had been at least four open two tops available, amongst other table options. Far from a full house. About 15 minutes later, I went to the host stand to ask again, and were seated around 7:05 pm. Right when we sat down, we were provided water and looked over the menu. About 10 minutes had gone by, and the waiter briefly stopped by and said he would come back. We waited a few more minutes and decided to leave. Fully understanding that the place was new, but it wasn't busy enough to be sat late for the reservation or to be ignored at the table. Didn't try one bite of food, but we won't be back. Service gets people coming back, and the staff didn't do their job."}
{"text":"The place is horrible! They charged our party of 7 a $25.00 fee to serve the graduation cake that we brought to the restaurant. I complained to management and am still waiting to hear from them. I won't hold my breath!! For this poor and terrible service that they did not provide well, I'm giving them a poorly deserved 1 star rating. Sad."}
{"text":"Having been open a couple of months, I decided it was time to give Masso a try.  The restaurant by Scott Conant took the place of Salute at Red Rock.  I went on a \"Senor Wednesday\" night when dinner is half price when you pay with points.  I had a reservation and was promptly greeted.  After a couple was seated, the woman took me to the patio area and I sat at a two top along the glass with a view of the small pond and mini waterfalls at the front of Red Rock Casino.  It was a lovely evening.  I noticed that they had installed mister fans for the warmer days coming and there were heaters for the cold ones that are leaving us.  I was soon approached by my server, Annemarie, and she took my iced tea order.  She also brought me a box of complimentary bread with an oil, garlic, and broccoli rabe mixture for use on the bread or for dipping the bread.  Annemarie was helpful in letting me know what dishes were suitable for a solo diner.  I ordered the creamy polenta (Polenta Boscaiol) for a starter and the whole sea bream for my main course.  The polenta was amazing!  Perfectly done and just the right amount for me.  It could also be shared by two.  Then came the sea bream which was very large.  Two filets on a bed of lemon, caper, olive oil, and kale.  There was a considerable amount of garlic also something I liked a lot. I generally don't order fish but I am not a salmon eater for the most part and the sea bream was just right.  Besides, I didn't want a veal chop that is large enough to kill someone if you hit them with it.  The dinner was served at a leisurely pace.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass several times.  It then came time for dessert.  There were two things on the menu that I wanted to try and I went with the pear crostata with crème fraiche ice cream.  It was very good and a good ending to the meal.  Masso was quite crowded when I left after 7 but there were always tables available on the patio.  I'll be back especially on those special Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Im beyond appalled at the reviews.... if you look at them, it's their soft opening.... meaning they are opening their doors to work out kinks before they open.  The food was amazing and the service was great!  As expected, it's not going to be perfect the first night, but it doesn't take away from the fact that tables around us were smiling after every bite! People need to relax and stop thinking the world revolves around them."}
{"text":"I ate there a few days ago.  The food is good but all the portions are very small. The appetizers are only good for about 3-4 bites, it is not for sharing.  I had the polenta Boscaiola it is about 1/3 cup, very small portion of cornmeal for $18.  I also had the roasted Octopus, it is 3 leg pieces about 4 inches long for $21.  The sea bass looks about 4-5 ounces and its $31.  2 glass of wine, $25, with the tax and tip is $125.  It is not a place for the hearty eaters.  I eat out most of the time and think it is very pricy for the size."}
{"text":"Scott rocks at Red Rock!  Glad to be able to fly in for second night of their opening weekend.  We enjoyed everything. Love the DOCG pizza. And love the stuffed peppers (his grandma's recipe.)  Got so full from some complimentary apps we did not have room for what we ordered. Glad we had a fridge back at our strip hotel for our leftovers.  And went to Scarpetta for another meal the next night too.  A+++"}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations. From the moment we walked in, greeted by two delightful hostesses.. ambiance is warm and welcoming. The menu selections and portions are perfect, priced well.   Great cocktails and wine list.  We had Scott's famous polenta.. I could take a bath in that. Tagliattle bolanase..caesars salad.. Gnocci..  focciacia...  we cleaned our plates.. the attention from the server and management was really nice. One  server in paticular, Anna Marie is a treasure. If someone could be cloned and put in every restaurant , they'd never go out of business. She alone is a good reason to return, which we will. We're locals and dine out often. Masso Osteria is a real treat. Thank you Mr. Conant for opening up in here.  deb.swan"}
{"text":"We had dinner on the patio the other night and it was delicious! Salad, pizza, and good wine, plus the service was awesome!  Ann Marie was delightful, efficient, and so much fun, we truly felt like we were one of the family. From the hostess, to the sommelier to the picturesque location....Masso Osteria can't be beat! One of our new faves."}
{"text":"Dinner with wife.  It's difficult to find Italian food with its own unique taste.  Quite often the food is simply taste \"good\" or \"bad.\"   Masso's breaks that barrier,  we tried three items on the menus and we're absolutely satisfied with the recipe!!   A little pricey but worth it, if your treating your spouse.  Besides inexpensive tends to translate to \"just ok.\""}
{"text":"The restaurant is very attractive and interestingly laid out. The selection of red wines by the glass was uninspiring. We had the wood roasted clams, wood roasted octopus, and the lamb shank. All the dishes were served luke warm. The clams were completely buried by the dry breadcrumb mixture. The octopus was tender and tasty but a minuscule portion for the price. There was hardly any meat on the lamb shank and what there was of it was hardly the tender, falling off the bone meat one would expect. My friend knocked over a glass of wine and wasn't offered a refill. The bartender told us that he was unsure of the restaurant policy in this regard because they had been open just a few weeks! We won't be going back."}
{"text":"First off, WOW! Second, finally good Italian Food at Red Rock! This place is amazing! If you are a fan of Chopped and of Scott's other restaurants, you will not be disappointed! Food is flavorful and very fresh tasting! High quality ingredients make for great food! Service is fantastic! The margarita pizza is amazing, the meatballs are good and the garlic bread is to die for! Scott is friendly and made his way around to all of the tables! I wish Scott much success here!"}
{"text":"This is a place you must try! Great food and service.  Such a step up, few steps up, from the last Italian restaurant that was here! Worth the drive to Red Rock!"}
{"text":"Oh. We were so disappointed. I watch the developer of this restaurant all the time in chopped and we could not wait to try Masso's out. Five of us ordered pasta. We could see immediately upon plate arrival that the pasta had little to no sauce. I'm only writing this because I wish for this restaurant to do well. Perhaps the chef will see he's not putting out food to support Scott Conant's wonderful reputation."}
{"text":"We started with some appetizers.  The Recco style 'garlic bread' , which is actually a toasted cheese quesadilla. It was ok if you don't want actual bread. The 2nd choice were the meatballs. Bland and frankly they tasted a little weird. Our last appetizer was the zucchini fritti. It was crispy, some had a light batter coating and all were salty.  For dinner we chose the veal parmesan which was a very big cut of bone in veal. It was bland and somewhat mushy inside. We also had  Ricotta stuffed pasta primavera. It was not good. The only vegetables in it were peas and a few slices of onion. Our service started out ok. As the food came out and the restaurant became busier our server disappeared. The back waiter continually asked if he could clear our plates - It was a tad annoying. The best thing about the place were the cocktails. If you want good Italian I'd say look elsewhere."}
{"text":"TLDR: Two stars for the excellent service provided by our server and food. Lower overall rating due to the way my restaurant reservation was mishandled and due to the unsatisfactory response from the restaurant Management when I brought it to their attention.  We made a reservation for 07:00pm and requested a booth for a party of 4. The reason for requesting a booth was, we have a child in our party and our child is still jet-lagged as we have travelled from East coast and tends to lie down at this hour (10:00pm EST). We showed up on time, and when I said we have a reservation for 07:00pm, the hostess stand looked surprised. They said, let me show you a table and let us know if you like it. They showed us a 16 capacity (8 on each side) tall stool-top seating area which was not acceptable to us. Reading other reviews I have now learnt that they offer this seating to those *without* reservation. They then asked us to wait until they could get us a booth. They said wait for 10 minutes at the other end of the restaurant. At 07:15pm, they didn't have a booth and they showed us seating with 4 chairs which we couldn't take for the reason mentioned above. While standing near the 4 chair area, I noticed an empty half booth half chair seating right across and asked to be seated there instead. The hostess said it was reserved for a 09:00pm reservation. At this point I said to her, we also have a reservation and we are here, why can't you give it to us? And why isn't anything reserved for us in a similar fashion.  I spoke to the manager and she was unapologetic. She essentially said the reservations are just \"luck of draw\". She said, restaurant honored our reservation by offering us the tall stool-tops. She even said \"some kids do like to seat on the stool tops!\". I asked her why can't they give us that half chair - half booth. Manager said they will need those beginning at 09:00pm. I asked why at 09:00pm and she relayed the same information that there was a reservation for it. And I said to her - \"exactly my point\". We also have a reservation. For us it was the \"luck of draw\" and for the 09:00pm party you are holding the seats since 07:00pm.  We got seated at 07:30pm at a different half chair half booth combination. The food and the service offered by the servers was excellent. Manager on the other had no sympathy and admitted no fault."}
{"text":"Sea bream cooked perfectly again.  We had asked for less lemon on the fish and it was a great call.  The veggie beneath was fish was very bitter and could've been because of the batch.    For sides, we ordered the carrots.  It was beautifully cut and cooked with light char on the outside.  A bit on the sugary side.  The mushrooms with it was delightfully tender.  Please don't leave without ordering a plate of Pasta Pomodoro to share.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner here about a month ago with two friends. We did the family-style prix fixe and it was amazing. So. Much. Food. Appetizer course was our favorite. Thanks for the great memory!"}
{"text":"OVER THE TOP AMAZING. I planned dinner here for my boyfriend's birthday. We celebrated with another couple and had an incredible experience. From the amazing wine selection to the tender Octopus to the Gluten Free pasta option-everything just kept getting better. Edward was our waiter and the whole table agreed that he was the best we have ever had. Not only was he attentive, but he knew the menu inside and out. We trusted him with the selections and he did not steer us wrong.The 32 OZ BISTECCA FLORENTINE was just as tasty as described. Overall, I would highly recommend, SPRINT to this restaurant....and request Edward if you want a five star experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurants ever! Completely stunning menu with extremely fresh ingredients and very creative chef behind the scenes! Servers were extremely nice and efficient. They have the whole try-it menu for only 65 that includes dessert!! Our server with a bow-tie was the best, and the girl who was helping, was mind blowing: she knew the menu like she created it!! And the first ever server who asked us if we have any allergies she should have known!! Such a lovely experience, don't miss!"}
{"text":"Good above average Italian food.  Nice Pasta Pomodoro. A bit pretentious in a Food Network kind of way.  They used the word convivial to describe the restaurant's  atmosphere.  Who uses that word other than at a spelling bee?  I had to look it up.  To use it in a sentence: If convivial was the goal when they planned the restaurant, they missed the mark the day I was there.    I like Red Rock's casino, so having a good restaurant to use with my comps is a nice addition.  So many restaurants at Red Rock have come and gone."}
{"text":"Lucky People  Dinner last night at Masso celebrating my friend girls birthday was casual and peaceful. The portions were generous and the house made pastas were delicious.   I look forward to returning in the near future once the restaurant volume is more manageable.  WHAT WE ATE:  Recco Style Garlic Bread $11 House Made Foccacia $4 House-Made Stromboli $8  Zucchini Fritti $13 Wood Roasted Prawns $22 - Great appetizer! The cous cous was satisfying.  Pasta Al Amadoro $21 - The portion was generous and I enjoyed this light vegetarian friendly tomato based dish! Squid Ink Rigatoni $28 - Surprisingly delicious! I was a bit apprehensive about the overly fishy taste but it was perfect!   Little Gem Caesar $14 - Excellent Margherita $10 - 2/5  Masso Mojitos $12 - By far one of the best Mojitos I've consumed. The lime bitters was a great addition to the cocktail!"}
{"text":"The waitress was pleasant. Very helpful. The kitchen service was very very slow. Took an hour to get our salad. Salad was good. Took another half hour to get entrees. The waitress assured me the gnocchi was not spicy. I couldn't eat it so my husband who ordered his fish had to trade with me. Very disappointing. Fish was ok. When I told the waitress about not eating my meal, she wasn't concerned.  To top it all off, when my daughter made the reservation she told them it was our Anniversary. When we got the bill, there was a hand written Happy Anniversary on it.  So don't expect anything.  We probably won't go back. There are other restaurants that are much better."}
{"text":"Celebrated my daughter's birthday last night at Masso. The service was fantastic the food on the other hand was extremely salty! We chose to get the tasting menu as of course to get a taste of several different recipes. We did order the beef tartare which was delicious but after that we did not finish anything, it was a shame too because the Sea Bass once's I rinsed it with water was delicious so wanted to eat the crispy kale I just couldn't do it. Our waitress was phenomenal and so was the rest of the staff that came and filled our water, took our plates, and switched out our silverware and tablesetting for each course. I had to laugh because tonight Scott.... you would have been chopped!!! The staff is fantastic the cooks on the other hand need a little more training. I was disappointed after looking so forward to it."}
{"text":"Was not at all impressed.High prices and small portions.As soon as all the food network groupies disappear and this place is left to the locals it will fail miserably.When in Rome do as the Roman's do but more importly when in Rome serve what the xxxxxxx Roman's want.O/U 18 months,Im on the under."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner for Valentine's Day. This is their soft opening. We had a 6:30 reservation and waited 15 mins for our table at the bar. My cocktail was the lamara pesca which tasted like San pelligrino. We had Zucchini frittes and beef tartare to start. We tried the squid ink rigatoni and the pecherri pasta. We had the salted caramel budino for dessert. There was quite a wait for the food but like I said this was a soft opening so I would come back to try more on the menu. Our server was friendly. I'd like to come back for the tasting menu and more desserts. It's just not one of my favorites I've tried in the"}
{"text":"Undercooked pasta. Overpriced ambiance. Unfriendly staff attempting a traditional Osteria. After leaving this place, my Italian is hurting. I petition to bring back Salute. At least they weren't trying to fake a new heritage."}
{"text":"We came on the second day after they opened. The restaurant is beautiful and immediately brings you into a fine dining, upscale headspace. We sat at the bar because we love sitting at the bar and our bartender/waiter was very accommodating and friendly. We were surprised when we actually saw Scott (the owner) in apron walking around and making sure the restaurant was performing to expectations. Awesome! We got the focaccia with three types of spreads. Amazing! We also ordered the lamb shank and the squid ink pasta. Both were delicious but our fav was the lamb shank which literally fell off the bone - no knife required. The flavor was there and the addition of the couscous was great. Wine bottle prices are very reasonable. We bought a bottle for around $48. Will be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, excellent food, and beautiful cocktails. Extensive selection of wines from different Italian regions, which pair nicely with the 'family style' menu. Sat at the bar and enjoyed some clams casino, steak tartare (best I've had), followed by the steak di manzo and the squid ink rigatoni. Then the bartender Mike G dropped the most amazing salted caramel budino on us for desert. Wow! Get in and get some!!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, great menu, great food, and spectacular staff a Plus five Star. Mike G. the bartender there spectacular new everything on the menu walked us through gave us a great experience. Anytime at the red rock we will be eating there!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our wedding anniversary and we just decided to sit at the bar. The cocktails were so good. The bartenders (I believe Michael was one of them) were awesome! Not only did they make great cocktails but they gave us good recommendations on food. We had tagatelle, sea bream, stuffed peppers and roasted asparagus. My husband is not a big fan of kale but it came with the sea bream and he ate every bite. Pasta was cooked perfect and the stuffed peppers were amazing. We cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Masso Osteria. We have been seeing several commercials for this place all over so we decided it was our time to try it. I am a big fan of Chef Scott and was looking forward to dining here. We had made reservations and requested a high top table. The High top was sat in the bar area which was an excellent area and we could see the whole restaurant. It also seemed quieter than the busy low section. We were sat right away and our drink order was taken. Our waitress Kaccee was an excellent host for our first time here and did a great job with recommendations and guiding us through the menu. She explained and we did not take warning that many of the dishes were meant to be shared. (That is your warning). She definitely knew the menu. They have great beer and wine selections and our water glass was always full. We caught part of the happy hour which has great beer and wine options.  Food, we decided on appetizer of Recco Style Garlic Bread. Picture a Quesadilla with bread. Thin buttery bread with  Stracchino cheese. A great substitute for Mozzarella cheese. The bread was cut into six triangles and was gooey and melty as you pulled it away from the plate. I think I may have found a new cheese. As for taste, crisp bread, buttery and garlic rich. As an appetizer it was filling , but we reserved some for a midnight snack. We also ordered the Tuna Crudo for an additional app. Located in the salad section of the menu, but for us it ate as more of an appetizer. nice fresh pink tuna on a bed of lettuce with lemon and pickled fresno chilis with breaded-crumbled jalapenos. We ate them as sort of a lettuce wrap for a spicy, sour and crispy one or two bite finger salad. There were many other things that looked and sounded amazing as we saw them go by our table. I can't wait to try more menu items.  Main course. Josie had the Paccheri. A more supple Penne style pasta, with a Neopolitain ragu. This was quite meaty and had that pinkish hue that may come from cooking in a red wine. The bite I had was a meat filled bite and cheesy. It did not have the normal Tomato taste or after taste of say a bolognese would have. Very good and my first time having that type of Ragu sauce. I had fish. My choice was the Sea Bream. If you are saying,what is that. So was I . I am glad I ventured into the unknown and ordered this amazing fish dish. So this is a white fish and I will not say its like a halibut because it is not. It is also not Bass. What is though is very good. This comes with two big pieces that fill this big pan. I could tell this is normally a quite plump fish as i came out with two pieces laid on a crisp bed of kale with capers and a roasted lemon for seasoning. A succulent, white and flaky fish that just melted in your mouth. The skin was buttery and crispy and when you add the perfectly cooked Kale underneath that also added a crispness to each flavorful bite. I took the first bite and was amazed, but then added the roasted lemon for a slight tartness that just added to how delightful this fish was. Order it but don;t add a side dish unless sharing. We had the fingerling potatoes with fresh grated mozzarella on top. they were very good but I paid more attention to my fish. We took a to go plate because there was so much food for just us two. Plus we needed dessert.  Dessert.....I had a Banana Bread with Vanilla Ice cream on top. A dense desert that definitely topped off my meal in an excellent way and made me quite full. Josie had a Tiramisu. Well, their deconstructed version. this version has the cookie on the bottom with drops of Mascarpone cheese around the edges with a dollop of Vanilla and chocolate ice cream.There were these little dots of coffee  that help get that Tiramisu flavor you are used to and an added Toffee drizzle. I will add photos later.  Thank you for Dining at Masso Osteria. If you couldn't tell I will be going back. again our server Kaccee was amazing and very helpful. From what i could tell all the staff have a great knowledge of what Chef Scott has put together. I can highly recommend going here. It is busy so make reservations. Go please and have a great meal. Value for amount of food was pretty good. If you go with a group will probably be better so you can share the various dishes."}
{"text":"Best new Italian spot in Vegas! The recco style garlic bread is a must to start. The pasta al pomodoro is made from scratch and dressed in one of the best sauces I've ever tasted, and if you like seafood and spice, definitely get the squid ink rigatoni you'll be glad you did. Thank you @culture_hour! #scottconant #massoosteria #sprezzatura #foodie #foodporn #food #foodstagram #lasvegas #redrockcasino #masso #foodielife"}
{"text":"I love the decor and the food here. Bartender Rahim is awesome!!! He made sure we always had drinks and made us feel like VIPs! He had excellent recommendations and made delicious yet strong drinks! Spicy rigatoni, their tiramisu and their bread pudding are all delicious!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Masso, we walked in on a Friday night with no reservations and the girls working at the door, weren't attentive at all and we missed a table because of that and had to leave.  The 2nd time at Masso, we walked in on a Sunday at 5pm, when they open and we took a table at the bar area. We were greeted by the very best waitress, Lauren who was very attentive and she suggested menu items as well as wine. She was absolutely the best waitress we've ever had! We took her suggestions and they were amazing. The food was so delicious. From the Stromboli to the pasta ragu to the octopus. Although pricey, the food was amazing! And the service impeccable! Thank Lauren for making our experience a great one!"}
{"text":"The place is packed! Only reservation we could get was at 8:30, but we went earlier to check in and they were able to accommodate us at 7:00. My husband and I shared the tasting menu. OMG! One excellent dish after another: from the polenta to the tuna salad; from the sea bass to the out of this world salted caramel pudding. Enjoyed every bite of it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Love their pomodoro pasta. Great ambiance and wonderful menu.  Great service."}
{"text":"This is definitely our new local spot for Italian.   Exposed brick walls meet modern white marble with an open kitchen that's vibrant and at the center of is all. The bar is bright with high top communal tables and blends seamlessly into an outdoor space. The patio is cooled by misters and accented with bright greens and turquoise giving it a Miami vibe.  My girlfriend took me last night for my birthday. We nestled into a dark brown tufted booth tucked into a dark back corner. The perfect vantage point for taking in a long meal.  The service was on point in every way. 100%   We took our waiter's suggestion and tried the tasting menu. Five courses each with several small plates, it was amazing. Highlights were the oil poached octopus, gnocchi with clams (already de-shelled which was nice), the crispy chicken, and a surprise grapefruit sorbet. It was such a feast we came come with so much leftovers. Yay!   Five courses for $65/pp. can't beat it.   Chef Scott happened to be in town. He seemed really engaging with all the staff and patrons. He took time to chat & take pics with so many folks including us. He even came back to serve us dessert complete with birthday candles.  (We weren't fans of his before, but we are now.)  Looking forward to going back to try happy hour & more of the menu."}
{"text":"The only reason why I am giving one star is because the only good/easy thing about this place was making a reservation which I made thru open table. My husband and I are huge fans of Scott Conant and we were so excited to try this place. I read some of the reviews before making the reservation and I was a bit skeptical but we decided to give it a try! Our reservation was @ 8pm on a Monday night to celebrate our anniversary. The restaurant was not even busy. We arrived thru the patio entrance, and we were greeted by a nice young lady. Shortly after, we were seated in a very awkwardly shaped 4 top in a walkway next to a server who was polishing his glassware. We didn't say anything about the awkward table as she gave us the menus and walked away. I literally felt like I had to shout for my husband to hear me. About 10 minutes later a gentleman came up and I suppose he was our server. He never introduced himself, and he didn't bother asking if this was our first time dining here? He simply asked would you like flat or sparkling water? Once he came back to pour the water, we didn't see him for another 10 minutes. No acknowledgement, no explanation of the menu, not even a wine menu was offered. The extra place settings on our huge table were not even removed. It looked like we were still waiting on half of our dinner party. When the server came back, (I would give a name if he ever offered one) he asked what would we like to drink? How about introducing yourself, asking if we are celebrating something?  Right then and there My husband and I got up and we went next door to Yard House. Luckily our server Kayla was wonderful and we were able to still enjoy our night. What a disappointment this place was, we were really looking forward to enjoying our anniversary and trying some delicious food. If you ever decide to try this place out, hopefully you have a much better experience and if not, there are plenty of other great options around there with much better service."}
{"text":"OMG.....Scott Conant took a photo with me, I watched him cook in their amazing open kitchen!!!!! This is by far the my new favorite Italian restaurant.  They just opened in Red Rock Casino and I will be here every chance I get!!!  My date and I were guided to Chef Scott's tasting menu and it did not disappoint let me just say, you need to try the Recco, Pomodoro, and save room for Tiramisu Affogado!!!"}
{"text":"ANOTHER amazing visit to Red Rock's Masso Osteria.   Me and my friend had the best Easter dinner ever!  Recco, Polenta, Tagliatelle, Tiramisu, Basil Chocolate Mousse Cake...and the best Illy Latte EVER made by Sophia!   See photos!!!!!  This place is always consistent and the staff seems so happy to be there!   Can't wait to go back and try their happy hour!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this to showcase the high level of service we received from Lauren. She provided friendly, efficient service, along with some recommendations which really were great! The patio seating was perfect and I highly recommend the Tagliatelle. The Recco garlic bread was a bit of a miss where some parts were cheesy and others a bit dry and at $11, a bit pricey. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"It hurts my heart to write this review because we wanted to love this place so much!!!  BUT, not even the spice of starvation could make this meal better.  It is by far the worst meal we have ever had in the five years we have lived in Vegas.   The staff was super kind and working hard despite how busy the restaurant was.  If this restaurant is open for more than a year I will be shocked.  The pastas are thick and heavy, dressed in flavorless watery sauces that need salt amongst much more and served luke warm.  The beet salad also has no dressing so you literally are eating beat and arugula with a few pistachios chopped and sprinkled on.  The goat cheese to beet ratio is like 1 to 100.  The polenta is served like a watery soup IT however did have some interesting flavor profiles if you could get past the fact you were drinking it.  The cocktail I ordered was awful so I figured a simple gin and tonic couldn't be messed up.  I was wrong the tonic was so flat I couldn't drink it either."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Scott C new restaurant and it was 5 star all the way from the service to the food and the thrill is seeing Chef in the kitchen and on the line making sure everything is perfect. Everything was perfectly seasoned and delicious the attention to detail is great and shows in the end product. This will definitely be my new neighborhood Italian place."}
{"text":"Love what they have done with the place. It's a big improvement. The food was amazing. I started with the wood roasted octopus and it was cooked perfect with a great smoke flavor. For my main I had the cedar roasted whole sea bass. It was flaky and moist cooked perfectly. My servers were great also very good service.  It was also nice to have Ashley one of the managers stop at our table to ask how our night was going and how everything was. I will definitely be coming here a lot."}
{"text":"Located in the Red Rock Casino. A great place with wonderful ambiance. The food was absolutely amazing. The garlic bread \"quesadilla\" was so addicting as the waiter had suggested. The rest of the food was very delicious. Must go!"}
{"text":"My mom and I had dinner here recently and enjoyed it.  We had a reservation but had to wait a few minutes for a table.  Not too long though.  Our waiter came by quickly and took our drink orders.  Mom had the mojito.  She really liked it.  I had the L'AMARA PESCA - Campari, white peach & passion fruit puree, thyme, Prosecco.  It was very refreshing and light.  We started with the RECCO STYLE GARLIC BREAD - wood fired with stracchino.  This was so good.  Almost like a quesadilla with thin layers of bread between lots of cheese and garlic.  I would go back just for this.  Mom had the VEAL CHOP \"PARMIGIANA - dandelion greens, pickled onions, tomatoes & burrata.  She enjoyed it but the serving was way too big.  And really $65!?  That is ridiculous when everything else on the menu is in the $30s.  I had the BONELESS VEAL CHOP MILANESE with arugula salad.  This was very tasty and I loved the arugula salad but it was $62.  Again too much.  Not sure why their veal dishes are a good $20-25 over everything else.  They need to fix that.  Maybe serve smaller portions as they are too big anyway.  For dessert, mom had a scoop of cherry gelato.  It had a nice cherry flavor.  I had the STICKY TOFFEE BANANA PUDDING with cookie crunch & coffee cardamom gelato.  The pudding was really good, almost like a bread pudding.  Not a strong banana flavor though.  More just a nice vanilla flavor.  So a few missteps on the food but otherwise nice."}
{"text":"Probably among the best deals in town right now is the tasters menu at Masso. For $65 per person you get multiple courses, tons of food and a great sampling of what they offer.  Two bread courses, two salads, two appetizers, two entrees and dessert.  The highlights were the tuna carpaccio, grilled octopus and flat bread. The polenta was so creamy, the best I've had in Vegas. Branzino was also good. Everybody thoroughly enjoyed this meal.  I hope they keep that tasters menu."}
{"text":"Overall,no we wouldn't come back. It was ok.To start we had the zucchini app,too spicy.The squid ink pasta had too much going on with the sauce,the pasta itself was bland not fresh.The lamb shank was fair.Tiramisu was disappointing,served with a ice cream (gelato?) then they poured a sauce over it that made it mushy.Staff was great,prompt,& friendly."}
{"text":"We splurged on the chef's tasting menu... It was totally worth it!  One of the best meals we have had in a very long time!  Everything we had was wonderful, but the pasta course especially stood out.    We were big fans of Salute, the restaurant that was in this space previously, so our expectations were very high.  Needless to say Masso more than fit the bill!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Masso was ok.  The music was too loud though.  My biggest complaint was my veal chop.  I couldn't eat most of it because I had the wonderful polenta and was full after that.  So I took the rest of my veal chop home.  The next day, I thought I'd have a delicious leftover.  Surprise, surprise...it was mostly fast.  I was so disappointed, especially since it cost $65."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with the meal we had here. My hope is that it does not go the direction of the other two Italian restaurants that occupied the space previously. Both of those started out great and then really waned as far as meal quality goes. Being that Chef Conant is a celebrity name I am hoping he keeps a close eye on it. Between the three of us we had the Caesar Salad, Tuna Crudo, Squid Ink Pasta, Whole Roasted Sea Bass ,Tagliatelle Bolognese and Marscapone Cheesecake. Everything was excellent with an emphasis on that squid ink dish...just delicious. I will definitely return.....and keep a watch on the consistency ."}
{"text":"On the 27th I decided to celebrate my birthday at Masso Osteria. 3 of us choose to do the Social Hour and ordered Salumi & Formaggi, Short Rib Polpette, Mortadella & Burrata Focaccia, Balsamic Glazed Pork Ribs and from the Dinner menu Wood Roasted Octopus. The food is trendy and the service (Ashley) excellent. We then ordered my all time favorite dessert Tiramisu and I've never had one I didn't like until this one hence the 4 stars. It was presented with 2 scoops of flavorless gelato on a thin bed of genoise dusted with cocoa powder. Not a single bite tasted like Tiramisu and I really didn't want a dish of ice cream which is what I got so I didn't eat it after the initial tasting. The place has a good vibe. The music was great and all of the TVs were tuned to the Food Network which I found amusing. Chef Scott was not there but we were told he would be there tonight and tomorrow night if you're going there just to see him."}
{"text":"The people that work there are some of the friendliest people at a restaurant, that I've seen in a long time.  Some very good dishes.   A very good restaurant inside the Red Rock Hotel,  in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was incredible slow. Cramped half booth.  Polenta was really really good. Entrees were okay. Lamb was super salty. Pasta tenderness was good but the flavor was just lacking or uninspired.   Server took about 4 trips somehow wrap up our two leftover items. Service picked up when they realized we weren't staying for dessert.   Place is middling at best. The service kills it even if the polenta was top notch.   Bottom line - id get the polenta to go. Wouldn't dine in again. Wouldn't recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Hands down to my favorite celebrity chef Scott Conant. What can I say,  atmosphere,  service, tasty food. You don't have to go to the busy Blvd, this is the place for amazing food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Food was average at best. Portions were incredibly small, prices were extremely too high. The waitress whose name I forgot was from Buffalo New York. She is the reason I am giving two stars she alone was worth two stars. She was very knowledgeable and tried very hard. She had everything locked down and excellent customer service. As for the rest the menu was way too small choices were limited at best if that place wants to survive it's going to need to add a lot more dishes. I understand you're paying for the chefs name. ButI've had better food at local restaurants in the area such as amore taste of Chicago, Mastro's, Maggiano's, Hell even Lucille's barbecue was better than that. $11 for garlic bread which was borderline stale flour tortillas with cheese butter and garlic. The clams casino we're all breadcrumb no clam nothing else. The meatballs were good I enjoyed. And the squid died rigatoni call Amari and crab dish was so petite that as I was eating it I saw desert come out that was bigger than my entrée. However tasty lacking in a lot of things. I wouldn't go back for free"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. Service was great. Very friendly. Restaurant is beautiful. Specifically the patio. Food had it's issues. Polenta appetizer was the best thing we had. Garlic cheese bread was more like a quesadilla. Did not work for me by itself but i used the polenta as a dipping sauce which actually worked well. Pasta was good but very salty."}
{"text":"Good restaurant, even better service. Ask for Luis. He's one of the best waiters I've had the pleasure to be served by. The pasta is amazing, fresh and perfectly 'al dente'. The meatball appetizer is excellent."}
{"text":"What an experience! The decor is amazing, elegant and inviting. The wine list showcases a diverse selection of regional Italian wines from all across Italy. The food is top notch, portions are generous and the pasta is divine. Service is warm, knowledgeable and memorable. Priced at $65 per person the 6 course family style tasting menu is a tremendous value and a fantastic culinary experience. Great job Masso Osteria!!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is amazing. Among siblings, I'm the only one not keen to Italian food. But when my daughter took me to this place, Masso Osteria,  wow, amazingly great Italian food. Now I'm craving for Italian food as long as it's Masso Osteria."}
{"text":"Masso is one of my new favorites! Chef Scott and his team are incredible!  When I heard Masso was coming the Red Rock, I was extremely excited as one of Chef Scott's other recusants here in Vegas is my favorite! So of course I had high hopes and exceptions..... happy to say that our experience here was just as fabulous and did not disappoint. Not to mention we got to see Chef Scott as he was at the restaurant for the opening. So cool!   Masso is located inside of Red Rock Casino.There are plenty of parking options including valet, self parking garage and surface parking offered by the casino.  I made a reservation earlier in the month when they began taking them, upon arriving to the restaurant the atmosphere was very nice, the decor is very welcoming, warm and enjoyable. We arrived right about 7p and the host staff was very friendly and kind and we were promptly seated at our table. Once at our table we met our server, who was very attentive and on top of his game! In speaking with him and getting to know him, he moved out here to Vegas from Phoenix to assist with the opening of this restaurant. Great service and staff always on top of anything we needed and a keen attention to detail.   We started with a bottle of the Slingshot cabernet ($50), which was a nice selection and enjoyable wine. For our food selections we wanted to try everything, but we just cant do that in one night! So here is what we tried....   Recco Style Garlic Bread ($11) which is two pieces of wood fired flat bread with garlic and stracchino cheese melted in between.    Wood Roasted Prawns ($22) prawns are roasted with a calabrian chili butter and served over cous cous.  Pasta al Pomodor ($21) deliciously cooked pasta with a signature tomato sauce and fresh basil. (OMG you have to get this! Simply perfection!)  Cedar Roasted Whole Sea Bass ($31) perfectly roasted sea bass served with grilled vegetables.  Mascarpone Cheesecake ($11) served with huckleberry compote and a crumble.  What a treat to have such an amazing culinary experience so close to home. I highly recommend Masso! Can't wait to go back....."}
{"text":"The two stars was for the friendly service. Now let's get serious. Why would the Red Rock put a celebrity chef restaurant with ridiculous high prices, small portions, and a limited menu in a local venue? This place should be on the strip where people are accustom to being over charged for the \"The Celebrity chef experience\". As we arrived as a party for 4, friends of ours was leaving (party of 5) and warned us the food was average at best and the place was a rip off.   Knowing this location has previously failed, why would Red Rock put something that caters to locals? That being said if you plan on trying this place. Don't bring your appetite but bring plenty of money."}
{"text":"Late Valentine's dinner at Masso's Scott Conant's new amazing restaurant. Recommend the $65 tasting menu. You get to taste the best of his menu for a fraction of the full price. 5  Stars    this is a big hit. Got plenty of leftovers to take home, but still can't wait to go back and have some more. The service was outstanding. Our servers were great. Caesar's is a stand out server. His knowledge about both food and wine was impressive. The pasta dishes were very Al Dente aka undercooked, but nothing I could not handle. I kind of eat the sauce and leave most of the pasta anyway. I'm sure that will fix that quickly. Glad to have this new option at one of my favorite local casinos."}
