{"text":"I LOVE the Perk! They have delicious and reasonably priced meals.. and their SNACK BAR-- oh the cookies, granola bars, muffins, cakes.. my mouth drools over their selection!  I usually get overwhelmed and buy too much, stuffing a loaf (or 4) in my purse for later. This is not a specialty coffee shop so if you're into judging the balance on your palate of 2 ounce espresso shots, I would not recommend the this cafe ;) But if you love people watching, yummy food, friendly staff, earl grey lattes and free WIFI- check this joint OUT!"}
{"text":"Nice coffee, huge food (especially the chocolate cake), interesting selection. Nice enough space, always busy.  NO more wi-fi. Limits the frequency with which I'll visit."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! The ladies at the counter are always friendly. The coffee is always fresh.  Nice change from Starbucks!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and come to purple perk often....almost daily. I support it and would like to see it succeed.  However, today is probably one of the most terrible experiences I've ever had at a food establishment.  It's in regards to customer feedback.  I was in line at the purple perk and I overheard a guest ask for gluten free. The girl behind was very apologetic and said she's sorry. Ok...they left....I saw the owner so I mentioned the situation to him and said it might be a good idea to have a couple options. Again, a valid point and giving feedback because I assumed he would actually care about his customers requests or concerns.  He said absolutely no way. And then proceeded to tell me he calls them \"glutards\".  I said I have friends who are gluten free and I took extreme offense to his callous response.   He said a lot of places don't have gluten free. You know what!? So what if they do!? You don't have to respond to a regular patron or any customer for that matter in the way you did sir!   Any well run business with great leadership would take that feedback, thank the customer and perhaps try to better their business.  I wonder if he treats his patrons that way how does he treat his staff.  It's a very unfortunate experience and has now cost the perk even more lost revenue because every single friend of mine now knows and we will not be taking our business there anymore."}
{"text":"Decent little coffee shop. Food tastes good BUT I had cold soup and a hair in my rice Krispy square. I may go back but I will stick to brewed or steamed beverages."}
{"text":"The Purple Perk is a great location if you want to catch up with friends or if you want to take your date out for an after dinner coffee.   The drinks and food are good, but quite pricey. The staff is good, but kind of.... \"spacey\".   I would have given this place a higher review if it was easier to find a table. The place is definitely for hipsters who take their laptop with them and stay for hours, drinking only 1 coffee. The patio in the summer is cute but again, hard to find a place to sit down.   I think Calgary needs more places like Purple Perk and Higher Ground, they are always popular and will remain so."}
{"text":"Needs a good cleaning.  I do quite like the look of a number of the food items at the purple perk, but I've had a difficult time allowing myself to order any of them. For one simple reason.  I worked in a coffee shop previously and I find the purple perk's pastry case to be down right disgusting. If you look at the glass and the space between the shelves and the glass there is enough food in there to feed an army...of ants, fruit flies, whatever other gross creatures likely want to get in and feast. If this was the coffee shop I worked in previously, we would have shut ourselves down just to do a deep clean for a few days before serving any of this to the public. You can see numerous times that cake icing or cheese or whatever has been scraped along the underside of the shelves and then not cleaned up. It is left there to mold and rot and be gross. Just waiting for another slice of cake to get scraped along it and take the old gross rotting food with it. YUUUUUUK. Please clean your pastry case! I don't even want to know what else is gross and just isn't out in the open for people to see."}
{"text":"Really good coffee, but the staff couldn't care less about customers. Service is minimal, food is ok. Go there with low expectations"}
{"text":"I entered this establishment for the first time not too long ago, I turned around and left without ordering  The only reason I left is they had a shelf of beans for sale in bags from Fratello Coffee Roasters. FRATELLO IS NOT THE PROBLEM, FRATELLO COFFEE IS AMONG THE BEST ON THE PLANET. Joel May from Fratello is a world class Barista Champion. The problem is that the shelf was labelled Cup of Excellence Coffee and not one bean was a COE coffee. They were selling it at 17.95 for 8oz and any consumer could buy this coffee direct from Fratello at $30 for a two pound bag. RIP OFF and false advertising, this is an instant deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"Great frappuccino & awesome breakfast menu! I find the service is hit & miss-some of the employees are very friendly while there are a couple who have repeatedly come across rude & snotty. I agree with previous posts about people without coffee or food just sitting at the tables to take advantage of the free wifi for hours so I usually just get my food & coffee to go. Overall though it is a nice alternative to the usual Timmies or Starbucks."}
{"text":"As a native Calgarian who now lives in Vancouver, I always make sure the Perk is included in my trips home. The espresso rivals the best of Vancouver's beans, and the generous portions for each of the bakery items always ensure a satisfying treat.  Atmosphere wise, I think it's the best you can get in the neighborhood. Standing at a contrast to the more affluent clientele, I like that a range of artists, students, elders, families, and entrepreneurs all set up camp here. Bring a book, paper, journal, or friend; and enjoy the afternoon here.  The outdoor setup is the perfect place to people watch!"}
{"text":"Coffee tastes like cardboard. Overworked individuals who unfortunately devote their time to a well located venue with no care for the bean. My macchiato took two seconds to make and just as much time to throw out.  In winter the windows frost over and the owner tends to kill the heat. I've seen it several times and it blows my mind!  If it wasn't for the location, this place would have closed awhile back. Hopefully, with some new competition in the area, it'll for The Purple Perk to up their game. They're just riding on location coattails right now."}
{"text":"I reluctantly give the Purple Perk three stars rather then four. On a few occasions something has been off. One time I ordered decaf coffee in the evening. When I asked for a refund because it was cold, I was told that it was because it had been brewed and sat around for many hours; not what I want to hear. So I recommend you order your coffee freshly brewed. The chocolate cake comes in huge slices and will satisfy a craving and then some.. - but, ask if it is fresh. They have some good desserts, snacks and meal items. It is a busy, buzzing place. I go occasionally."}
{"text":"My favorite local spot to study, drink coffee and relax. Friendly customer service and delicious food. Support your local coffee shop!"}
{"text":"I love the Purple Perk - the coffee and food are great, there is free wifi and it is a welcoming, unique, and buzzing place.  I always come here to study.  The only thing that annoys me is that they don't clear people's food dishes away in a timely manner... I'll come and sit at a table for 2 hours which the previous customer's plate is still on, and it won't be gone by the time i've left.  I know its a busy place, but I think the staff need to make clearing and cleaning tables more of a priority.  But like I said, the place awesome.  The starbucks across the street is never half as busy, and for good reason.  Yay Purple Perk!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice coffee and friendly staff. It's the perfect independent coffee place that has everything you would need. I would love to bring my book and chill out for a few hours except that the indoor space isn't the most cozy. If they had a few more comfortable tables and chairs then it would make the world of a difference. Otherwise, picking up to go? Excellent."}
{"text":"A great place to get some work done over a coffee and a slice of pie. I spend a lot of there because it has free wifi and big tables. It can get very busy and loud around brunch time but that's all part of the charm. Its the neighbourhood coffee shop  and draws an eclectic cross-section of Calgarian society.   There are plenty of vegetarian options but the food isnt the draw, its fairly basic comfort food.  Savory dished i have tried: The vegetarian lasagne is a good size and fairly good value. The veggie wrap is disappointing - there are very few veggies, mostly just vermicelli noodles.   Brunch: is solid but it gets busy so come early.   Pie: a revolving door of great pie, not great if you are trying to loose weight!   Ideal working those working at a shop days with excellent pie!"}
{"text":"I spent a couple of hours reading my book and people watching. The chicken pot pie was incredible and I always enjoy their coffee. I think those having issues with the free wifi will find that it is now a shaw wifi hotspot. Works for me! I enjoy the cozy atmosphere and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Home fries are drowned in BBQ sauce.  I know Calgary is a barbecue and beef city, but surely not many people want their brunch drowned in BBQ sauce.  The Benny hollandaise and veggies were good.  But the portabello Benny does not come with a muffin and the menu does not state this fact."}
{"text":"We planned to visit a few downtown coffee shops and take a break from S-bux. Finally, today we had the opportunity to get The Purple Perk experience.  Which was meh.  Service was nice and friendly, but coffee tasted below average. Tables were hard to come by, especially outside. There were quite a few hipster types drifting in and out. Lighting is kind of dim inside.   Overall - average."}
{"text":"Even though I am giving Purple Perk two stars, I have been here many times and mostly due to convenience.  I have stopped by to grab a coffee, eat lunch, enjoy desert, and meet up with friends and I'll have to say that every time I visit the service is what I would call \"meh\".  Usually the staff seem distant and move at a very slow pace, so it's a good thing the food is yummy here or I probably wouldn't stop by much more.  The lunch options are all quite good and filling and the sweets are quite divine, so that is a plus for this place.  The coffee is standard, but I haven't tried a latte or anything yet so I can't comment on the quality of those.   Another reviewer mentioned that the wifi is shut off when the place is busy, which I have encountered and can be frustrating when you head to this cafe with some work or studying to do.  Also if you ask the staff about it, they usually shrug it off and that's that.  So, definitely think about that when you are considering stopping by here with your laptop... bring a book instead.    It's not like I won't be by here again for food and coffee, but I know there are better cafes in the city to visit if you have a chance.  Also, it can be difficult to get a table, so choose your visit time wisely."}
{"text":"I just want to start by saying that Purple Perk doesn't have free wifi. When I was there last week (late October 2013) there was a sign on the door saying that they no longer have it.   I'm not in the income bracket to get daily lattes, but always wondered why people frequented starbucks when there's a mom and pop shop right across the street. Now I know.  The coffee is worse than Starbucks! Seriously! They've burned my espresso every single time. I've had three lattes here and they were all just atrocious. When I told the barista she said \"that's what coffee tastes like\".   Thought I'd give them a second chance for the food. Got veggie chili with a side salad. Way overpriced, cold, and bland. It was clearly a couple cans of diced tomatoes and that bean mix you get from superstore. The salad wasn't even dressed. The portion was a snack size at best and was accompanied by hot sauce from a cook who said \"here, you're gonna need this\".   The place is dirty and full of oil and gas wives who bitch about their first world problems. If I wanted to be surrounded by dirty dishes and self entitled trophy wives while drinking shitty coffee, I'd take the short walk to Roxboro and invite myself into someone's home.   Dear god. No thanks."}
{"text":"The food here has no quality control. On SEVEN different occasions in the last three years I have been served food with mold on it! This includes food from the kitchen. In the front of the cafe is a food display that I have seen infested with fruit flies more then once. And I mean infested. Swarms of fruit flies crawling out of cobblers or what ever month old \"treat\" they are trying to sell. Service is insanely slow, even if it's dead. Owner is a total creep and and comes off as a jerk. This is the worst cafés I have ever been to."}
{"text":"I dream about Purple Perk's Huevos Rancheros and their hash browns with secret sauce. Hipsters abound and people watching at it's best. A true neighbourhood fave place for all times of the day .....or night."}
{"text":"Expect to be surprised about how good the food is at this coffee shop. At first glance The Purple Perk looks like any other coffee shop until you try one of their massive deserts or delicious meals (and the coffee isn't bad either). The staff is friendly if sometimes a little absent and the only reservation I have is that it can sometimes be a bit difficult to find a table. This is due to the fact that free wireless is available and the place is often loaded with the laptops of trendy business-types or art students."}
{"text":"The eggs Benny is not good, hollandaise sauce has a weird tangy taste. The eggs were way over cooked and asked to be made really soft."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place to grab a tea or a coffee and a snack with friends, or maybe do some studying (which thankfully I'm about 18 years too old for). I've only been here later in the evening on Sunday nights or weekend days. The service is always friendly  and they have a mix of food options from mac and cheese (interesting flavour kick) to sammies (beef wrap is good as is the chicken wrap) and sweets.  While I've never swooned over anything I've had, I've never been left disappointed either.  They also do office catering (Including my office) and they do a good job of that. Lots of neat wraps and other yummy salads to choose from. Cool flavour combos etc.  The Perk is solid. It might not wow you but I don't think that's what they are trying to do."}
{"text":"I really want to support local businesses, and have been here numerous times, but the Purple Perk is consistently plagued by loud music, cramped seating and slow service. The coffee is good, the food is good, though neither stand-out from other coffee shops. The staff are friendly and work hard, but service can take a long time, even when it's not especially busy. Trying to find a path from the counter to a table (if one is available, that is!) is like finding one's way through a maze, as the tables are all set very close together. A simple fix would be to get rid of the sign by the front display case, and to replace some four-seat tables with two-seat tables to open up a bit more space. And turning down the music would improve the store's ambiance -- if it's busy enough for patrons' conversation to drown out the music, there's no need to crank the music up!"}
{"text":"There is something about hanging out on the sidewalk in mission that gives one exposure to the vast ranges in lifestyles of Calgarians. From the patio, to the North I can see Master's Gallery. Directly south is Mercanto. And yet, the street with everyone to young professionals with dogs the size of my big toe to strange down-on-their luck people. The dichotomy characterizes the area so well.  I had a Vietnamese coffee which they surprising served cold. The coffee was fine, but I don't think I would drink it cold again. Cold didn't feel right to me.  All in all it's a decent coffee shop. I would like to try the food next time. 8/30"}
{"text":"Purple Perk has the best coffee in town. In addition to the carbo snacks most coffee shops have (except PPs are fresh made on the premises) their is a full kitchen for very good week priced good.  My favourite!"}
{"text":"Any time I go to the Purple Perk I always ask myself the same question, \"Doesn't anyone in this city work?\"  No matter what time of day you go, this play is always packed. Not bad for a coffee shop that opened about four years ago.  It wasn't always this popular, I remember going when it first opened and I would have the whole thing to myself.  But because it is so popular, it has become the perfect example of table-hogging.  It is a great place to do networking and get some work done, but because it is so small, people tend to hold on to tables for way too long.  Some people are respectful enough to share their tables with you, but that's always the case.   The Purple Perk has actually decided to turn off their wifi during the middle of the day.  That way, those aspiring writers who waste their time on Facebook don't feel inclined to hand around all day.   And in case you've never tried it, the Perk is also the home of the $8.95 cup of coffee.  Calm down, it is just a clever name.  With the coffee, you also get a 2 eggs, 2pcs of bacon, hasbrowns and toast.   Not a bad deal, especially in Mission"}
{"text":"Coffee is pretty good. The 8.95 breakfast special is really good though, deal wise and for the hashbrowns that are too damn tasty to neglect. Are those done with Bullseye BBQ sauce? Or is that endorsing  the wrong brand? Perhaps its a presidents choice version...Blue menu bbq, or is it from costco...simply sauce? Im getting off track, fact is, the food and bev. is good but its so packed, thats stupid when Iook at the design of this place I see an overly huge serving counter that takes up 3 times the amount of space it should and the same amount of room as the seating area. Id go more often if I could sit."}
{"text":"I discovered this place via Yelp, and it turned out to hold the most decadent treats of my stay in Calgary. In looking at the case in the front of the place, I spied the butter tarts. And if that wasn't enough for an afternoon snack, I paired it with a mocha shake. A combo that was a bit much for my stomach. But oh so good for the soul. (If only they had a smaller version of the shake, that would work better for me.) I was rather surprised at the balance of sweet to savory flavors the tart had; as for the shake, I felt it could have been thicker and perhaps not quite as sweet. This spot also appears to be a good joint for a nice lunch, from the other selections I saw in the case as well as a glance at the menu. As for hanging out for the wifi, you'll find you have to jockey for the few areas that have access to power outlets (or come with fully charged laptops/mobile devices); logging onto the free wifi's a little bit more tricky than it perhaps should be, but I did eventually get online. Cool to see folks braving the remnants of the summer storm that tore through earlier that day, by drying off some of the outside seating at the front of the cafe and not minding the wind. So at some point, I'm hoping to make another visit, and try more cool eats at The Purple Perk."}
{"text":"Got take out lunch last week, was not impressed. The wrap comes with some overly oily plain potato chips, so I asked for a substitute salad instead. I was charged $2.50 extra, but didn't know how little the substitute salad is! It's tiny! Finished the countable pieces of lettuce in a couple of bites. This lunch was definitely not worth $12. Why do we have to pay more to eat healthy?  The wrap was only ok. Ingredients were fresh but there were only 5 pieces of chicken in my chicken perk wrap. Not happy."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the atmosphere here.  Super cozy and the brownies are delish! Price is a bit high but it's well worth it! Whenever I am back in town, my best friend and I always come here for a latte and brownie to catch up."}
{"text":"Absolutely a place to people watch!  Love coming here for coffee and meetings.  This place is always packed during the summer.  I wish the place is a big bigger!  Massive cheesecake!  You definitely need to share it!  I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The Purple Perk is a trendy coffee joint downtown Calgary that attracts the likes of families, singles and couples.  They've got an impressive selection of food (everything from the biggest slice of chocolate cake I've ever seen - to mac n' cheese) and the atmosphere is welcoming.  They offer free wifi for customers and pretty much every person that's in there has got a laptop on hand.  The service leaves a bit to be desired however. It's slow and inefficient - so clients who are used to coming here are exceptionally patient, whereas newcomers can be seen rolling their eyes and grumbling profanities under their breath.  A great location and a great ambiance, but the service sets it back a couple stars."}
{"text":"The Purple Perk sits somewhere around the average mark for me. Nothing really screams out at me saying this is the place to be or is outstanding in any way.   I've ducked in here a few times for supper, a cake and a Sunday morning coffee on different occasions.   Food was good yet nothing that stood out from other menus I've seen. Cake was ok but had that overly sweet, overly processed flavour to it. And my Sunday morning coffee... Lets just say you don't stuff up someone's first coffee of the day. Anything pre caffeine on a Sunday I have little tolerance for. Taking my order for a coffee, then promptly forgetting about my order and deciding to count tips for a bit, then walk off and have a chat with other staff and then make two other coffees for customers who came in AFTER me all while I was still standing at the takeaway counter waiting.   Not impressed to say the least. If the staff were a bit more switched on surely they would take notice of someone quite obviously waiting for a drink.   Will happily explore the Mission area for better coffee places, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Sweating to the Oldies  I work out of coffee shops and I am becoming familiar with what is good and what is bad. I decided to try Purple Perk for the first time which is strange since I have been to so many in the city.  Food - It was very good. I had an Huevos Rancheros wrap that was very tasty and enjoyed it quite a bit. It had a rich cheese sauce that added lots of zest/flavor to it. My GF had a raspberry scone that was super yummy.    Cleanliness - It was quite dirty and I'm curious how often that it is thoroughly cleaned. The display case (as noted by a prevous reviewer) is dirty with crumbs/spills. A little nervous that the same critters that nibble on the old leftovers are not too far away in the cafe :S. The bathroom was missing paper towel and had to move over to the other bathroom (with wet hands) to get more. Nothing like an Xlerator to fix that potential problem to reoccur.   Comfort - I like the tables lining the back of the cafe. Comfy seats to work from with readily available plug-ins for my computer. However, it was quite hot in the cafe and it looks like they use nature as climate control in the cafe (aka. occasional cool breeze). It became too stuffy and hot after awhile and so I had to leave to another cafe. Before leaving, I did have to map out my get-a-away through the maze of tables/chairs/bystanders waiting in line for ordering. A little bit of a cluster-fuck.   Ambiance - It was very casual and relaxing atmosphere which made it feel easy to work in. However, the surrounding music did not match the character of the place. The music was much older then most of the clientele/decor. The music was more suited for a 50's/60's diner which it really didn't identify as. I had to plug my ears with music that I thought more suited the place.    Onto to the next cafe..."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say I've lived in the area for 4 years and today was the first time I stopped in. What a quaint little shop with a surprisingly big menu. I had no idea they served food here, well besides the usual coffee shop fare. I tried the cup of coffee breakfast item and it was great, eggs, bacon, stunning multigrain toast and what they call hashbrowns but were unidentifiable as food. The hashbrowns are the only reason they're not getting 5 stars today. I've never had barbeque sauce in my potatoes before and actually didn't mind it but after trying three bites, they were so hard and dried out that I concluded the sauce was an attempt to soften them.  It didn't work and they definitely shouldn't have been served. Everything else was wonderful though, make sure you are prepared for a wait as the usual doofuses working on their screenplays take up the majority of the tables whilst not purchasing anything."}
{"text":"Food and service are hit and miss. I'd avoid the wraps and pre-made items, 9 times out of 10 they're not great (Soggy, Overcooked, undercooked) Food from the kitchen though is pretty good, decent sized portions and prices for a coffee shop. Desert and baked goods are also AWESOME, the Cakes are huge and so damn amazing, I can't get enough of the Cheesecake!  Service is hit and miss, sometimes the staff are rude, sometimes they're super nice, just depends on the day really I guess.  Great atmosphere for work or just a place to meet up with a few friends over a pretty good cup of coffee. Beware of the laptop users hogging bigger tables for themselves (like me), the free and relatively quick Wi-Fi brings them in en-masse."}
{"text":"Coffee, solid, food good value, service-the team looks like they need another coffee!  I can only image how challenging it is working in a cafe, being welcoming is not easy, however it is part of the gig.  Had to clear my own table and watched others as well, the location will always make it busy."}
{"text":"We order a latte and a lavender latte and both were some of the better coffee drinks I've had. The staff was nice, moved the line along swiftly and we had our drinks in no time. We didn't stick around long but there were a far share of people seated mostly working. There is no question I'd get another latte from this location."}
{"text":"Nice place to go to meet some friends for coffee.  Always jugs of water available and ample seating.  The coffee is okay.  I'm unimpressed with the menu but I am fairly picky."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. Looks run down and the drinks/food are very average.  Also, the place has the feel of a diner, not a coffee shop, and has a weird vibe in general."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the massive chocolate cake. It's dry and can't be saved by th layers of icing.  I had the chicken fettuccine and it was also sub par. Bland sauce and flavourless chicken. Large portion size though."}
{"text":"Came here on the recent summer visit to Calgary.  Was here for lunch with friends.  Their coffee is GREAT, they definitely know how to work an espresso machine around here!        For Food, I Ordered a Spaghetti Bolognese.  My friends ordered other items. All their meals had been served while I waited for my Spaghetti.  Then, they had finished eating all their lunches.  My Spaghetti still had not been served yet.  I was aware that service times Canada are slower than in California, but it was comparatively an extremely long wait for a spaghetti.  My friend's then completed their meal so I requested the Spaghetti to-go. The women behind the counter wasn't exactly friendly.  Anyway, finally after a long wait, I get my Spaghetti in a to-go container.  After a short hop back to my friend's residence, I finally ate the Spaghetti. WOW!  It was an incredible Spaghetti, the noodles cooked al Dente.  Meat sauce was not too salty or too much tomatoes.  Garlic Bread toasted to perfection with just the right amount of garlic.  It really was a Spaghetti dish to rival any Italian restaurant. Unfortunately, the wait time for the dish was unacceptably long.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Had heard so much about a place - what that does is create an expectation and when it (the place) falls short of lofty expectations - it's disappointing to the point where this visit will be the first and the last one for sure.  Ordered Cake, Hot Chocolate ($3.90) and small Latte ($3.90) the slice of chocolate cake ($7.95 for a slice)  is definitely a store cake and saw preparing them hot chocolate with Nesquik Chocolate Syrup and jug of chocolate milk that one buys from superstore.  This is not one expects when we pay premium monies for just mass production products. Cake is made to mimic Cheesecake Factory (USA) style - it definitely matches it in price but absolute sub par quality.  In addition to quality, the cake fridge has tons of cake creams shaved enough to feed army of ants and not so welcome guests for leftover food causing mold.  Good thing about cafe is its location - that's about it!  No stars for ambience, cleanliness, quality or price point but five stars for location."}
{"text":"Cute little place with a surprising amount of seating. Patio in summer out front. Good product - strong, smooth coffee. Staff guessed that the beans were Colombian when I asked. Overall the staff were disconnected and not overly friendly. Place could use a good cleaning and seeing fruit flies around the cream station next to the dirty dishes station - not so great. But for take out, overall 3 stars as I really liked my wet capp. Great location for people watching on 4th. Free wi-fi of course. Lots of baked goods, wraps and supposedly very popular for their breakfasts. They close at 10pm on weeknights, 11pm on weekends."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and good value. Service is dodgy. Great art on the walls and they play excellent music."}
{"text":"Purple Perk is a great little local coffee joint always buzzing with energy. The coffee served is always fresh and strong. Of course, they've got a good selection of teas for tea-lovers as well.   I like the variety of seating that's available at Purple Perk. They've got elevated seating that's conducive to people watching and confers a bit of privacy. The low table seating is accessible for those not able to walk-up to the other seats.  The Perk has a good selection of savoury and sweet foods you can enjoy, excellent if you plan to hunker down for a while in the store or if you're simple just peckish. The free wifi that is available in the store will keep you productive! I really also appreciate the fact that the staff don't seem to mind if you stay awhile! I always feel comfortable in the store and have never felt like I've overstayed my welcome :)  I wish they had more Purple Perks in the city."}
{"text":"The Perk is a friendly somewhat funky coffee, breakfast, lunch, and supper spot that will accommodate the appetites of varied guests quite well. Although the menu and its items have changed names and style somewhat, the all-day breakfasts are very good. I usually get the 'famous cup of coffee' for breaky, but the omelettes are also large and look great.  The portobello burger, spinach lasagna, and reuben are also very good (they could be more generous with the corned beef), leading me to believe that all the menu items are also scrumptious. The cherry and other pies are filled with fruit, and although the crust tends to be thick and not very flaky, the filling is worth it. I bought a whole cherry pie for take-out one day, and carried it home in their quality enamel pie-dish: such an honour system is rare these days, and after eating it at home over the course of several days, I returned the plate as if it was 50 years ago when such things were commonplace. For those of us who like to rub shoulders with friends and new acquaintances alike, it's one place to be for a great visit.  Check it out for yourself, okay?  And see if you find it equally homey."}
{"text":"Across the street from Starbucks ... how does one choose?  (Is Purple Perk local? Family run? do they give back to the community?) . I have no idea.  I guess I should know.  I feel like I should use the local coffee shop ... however, I really do like the consistency of Starbucks.  I've been to Purple Perk many times in the past 10 or more years.  I find the line up ... a bit crooked ... a bit long ... and a bit cumbersome.  On a warm day in fall and spring - sitting on the West Facing street patio is awesome."}
{"text":"I just wanted to update the new employees.. Very Nice! I haven't been sassed in months! thanks guys your awesome! AND they turn off the wi-fi during peak times so there is actually somewhere to sit! Suck on that you wi-fi stealing, table hogging cheapskates!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe on 4th street. Great food and coffee. And don't be scared if there's a line the staff are very good at being quick making the food and drinks."}
{"text":"Go for the chocolate cake about a foot high! Play 70's and 80's music. Coffee is very good."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times and have decided I will never go back.   The drinks are never hot enough.  Tables never cleared off.    I want stainless steel cutlery, not plastic for the price.  They were out of cutlery last night and when I asked for a spoon they said they were all dirty - SO wash one! The girl behind the counter chatted to her customer friend for a long time before she acknowledged me.  This place lacks proper management.   And the glass door to the bathroom makes one feel like it's a see- through door - especially at night!"}
{"text":"We went here on a saturday to catch up and celebrate with a couple of good friends who bore great news that they're expecting. Good things happen to those who strive with hope and dilligence  This cafe has a cozy feel too it that is quite welcoming. Great place to come to on a night that you want to be out to socialize with a small group (perhaps a date?)but want to avoid the rauccous crowds parading around the mission and 17th ave area. I also loved the subtle Max Romeo tunes that played in the background.  I had their lemon merengue pie accompanied by an Americano. The pie was excellent but the Americano kept me up all night :( .I stayed up all night watching Scent of a Woman. You win again, caffeine."}
{"text":"Lots of people and lots of productive energy: The Purple Perk is a great spot for a public meet up, be it social or business. There's half-booth seating along the back that makes for a comfy spot to sit while you get a bit of reading or lap-topping done or while you wait for a guest.  Check out Reuben Tuesdays. I'm not sure if they only have reuben sandwiches on Tuesday's or if they're on special, but either way, they're rather delicious. With sandwiches coming in at the $10 - $12 dollar range it's not really a cheap place to eat for what you seem to get. As of right now, I don't think I'd actively seek The Purple Perk out as a place to go eat, but I definitely wouldn't hesitate to order some lunch if I was feeling hungry and was meeting up for a coffee. Likewise, I don't think I'd actively seek out a \"to-go\" coffee at The Purple Perk, but it's a great spot to meet up with someone over a cup of joe.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If a coffee isn't sold and food isn't purchased... would anyone care?  TWO stars... that's all I can give.  Sound HARSH? Really?  If you look at Yelp's definition of each Star, I think some people might rethink their rating.  5 Stars - Wooho! As good as it gets! 4 Stars - Yay! I'm a fan. 3 Stars - A-OK. 2 Stars - Meh. I've experienced better 1 Star   - Eek! Methinks not.  The coffee at the Purple Perk - awesome! 4 Stars :) The lattes - yup, they're awesome too! 4 Stars :) The food - never had a bad snack/meal yet! 4 Stars :)  How about the location? Love it. 4 Stars :) Outside seating - perfect on a hot summer's day or night! 4 Stars :)  Size of coffee shop - yup - that's great too! about the size of two or three Starbucks combined. 4 Stars :)  So what's not to like? Well - what's the one thing I've yet to mention?  People...  There are staff... and there are patrons. Let's begin with the staff.  I actually think the staff are okay. 3 Stars. They do their job and I've always received exactly what I ordered. Feeling - satisfied.   Let me ask this... With the quality of food and drink, the location and flair like that of the Purple Perk - are you looking for a A-OK or \"satisfied\" experience? Or a GREAT experience?   Please don't misunderstand me, the staff are nice people - I've never been treated rude or with disrespect by anyone. I'm just saying I've \"experienced\" better. Some coffee shops ask for my name, make my coffee just for me, and call me by name when it's ready. The WiFi is available too... but that's another conversation.  My biggest frustration - space. Not because their isn't any... rather because it's all taken up by individual people who hold a table for four... for themselves... and their 1 coffee/tea and their computer. I've seen many times where I'll be early for a meeting - say 20 minutes - meet up with a friend, colleague or client... and then at the end of our meeting (an hour or so later) the solo acts are still there at their table for 4. And... not a single coffee or speck of food ordered.   No doubt the Purple Perk is a busy place - with a location like theirs, what coffee shop wouldn't be. With busy, comes sales. When sales are good - sales bring profit. Enough profit to cover get your WiFi fixed? ;-)  I don't know if the Purple Perk truly has WiFi or not - I can see the  network but I can never seem to get on and the one time I did get on - I got a popup that said someone would like to join my network or something weird like that - I quickly shut things down.  My point is this. I love the food, I love their coffee... but I would'd rather avoid going there as they seem to cater to those who aren't there at all... the people who don't buy anything and sit at a table of four... all by themselves  If I DO go there - it's out of convenience, not loyalty. It's because the person I'm intending to meet set up the location...   Let me ask this - if the Purple Perk was your coffee shop, would you want LOYAL customers or convenient based customers? Loyal customers or Satisfied customers?  What's the difference you might ask? Well let me put it to you this way... let's say you're married... do you want a satisfied spouse or a LOYAL spouse ;-)  I'm a loyal customer at may places... because the experience I receive is 4-5 stars from top to bottom, for the product or service, and most importantly by the PEOPLE that both patron and work there."}
{"text":"I think this place has some of the best brunch in town. My favorite part of this place is I can bring my dog in the summer, sit out front, and enjoy the street life with coffee and food. Anywhere I can bring my dog I will love!   The food is SO good. The coffee is great. The vibe is always bumping.  Decor is a bit messy and dated, but you'll be too over stimulated to even notice. Make sure you plan to wait for a table and your food, it's almost always busy!"}
{"text":"TO everyone who has ever studied in a coffee shop: I would caution you to ever got to Purple Perk on 4th Street. This morning my friend and I went there to get some breakfast, coffee, and study. we went in just after 9:00 am and at 11:30 (after each spending about $15) the owner (middle aged man) came up to our table and said \"There are people waiting for this table, This is not a place to camp out all day. we sat there for a second like what the fuck are you talking about?\" to which he replied, \"you have to go, you have ten minutes\" ... So I we sat there for a second like are you serious? and then I went over to him at the counter and said \"Just to let you know, I come here quite often to eat dinner and lunch, and I will never be back, that is ridiculous\" his response to that: gave me two thumbs up and said \"That's what I want to hear\" some things you should note are: there were other people who had been sitting at their tables for just as long as we had. we were sitting there, silently, doing work, not disturbing any one. I don't understand anyone who runs a business this way, so I am telling you: don't go there. It's over priced and the owner is a dick bag. apparently it is the new kind of coffee shop where people sitting on laptops working and paying for food are not allowed.  PS Starbucks is right across the street, and cheaper."}
{"text":"I've visited the Purple Perk a few times, and have always enjoyed their homemade sandwiches and goodies. On this visit, we enjoyed the warm hummus dip with tortilla chips. The Chicken Caesar wrap needed work though. Did not taste of Caesar salad at all. In any event, this is a nice place to sit outside along 4th Street and watch the world go by."}
{"text":"Also tried the Reuben. It was very good! $11 with salad and was made from scratch. Delicately grilled and a great sauce!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times, all with different people and all at different times of the day and enjoyed each visit. I've never had an issue with service or with quality of the coffee/tea/whichever.   Mainly: I like that I'm not sitting in Starbucks or Second Cup, and instead supporting a local business.  I was there yesterday and it was quite warm outside (28C) and they didn't have any air conditioning on... or windows open. It was a bit of a sweat-fest, but I just got a cold drink and stripped down to my skivvies, so problem solved."}
{"text":"What makes me a fan? Their hot chocolate! it's my favourite in the city... (I believe they make it with chocolate milk and that's probably why it tastes so good) yum! :P"}
{"text":"Happiness is when I can station myself on outdoor seating, nibble away at a baked goodie (most likely a sweet berry square) whilst enjoying the sunshine a lovely day. Purple Perk allows me to do just this. Located in the Mission district along 4th Street, the cafe gets constant traffic and is thus usually bustling. They offer coffee drinks, baked treats, omlettes, salads, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, chilli, and the list goes on!  Another perk (hehe) is that they are open quite late, allowing you to take your time with your food and/or bevvy while getting work done, catching up with a pal, or subtly people-watching. I personally enjoy hanging out in a happenin' locale such as the Perk where there is muted chatter and noises, along with music of the just-right volume.  I'll have to try the coffee next time, but the tasty desserts are great for sharing... Or polishing off by one's self."}
{"text":"Omg, I can't believe the rating for this place is only 3 stars. Well, it's a 5 star in my book. Goes every week, close to work. Great food, priced alright, slightly higher than I'd like it to be, but considering how delicious most things are, I'll happily fork over the money. Fave, chicken perk wrap, tuna artichoke sandwich, curry lentil soup, and WHITE CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY SCONE is the best scone I've ever had. Not so good, gumbo soup, really salty, muffins, a bit oily and kind of big. brewed coffee, so over-priced at 3.5$ for a medium, when I can get organic coffee at Eurphoria across from my house for 2$. But still, one of the best cafes in downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"I've passed this place a few times and it was always crowded. I went in today and saw they had a breakfast menu. (I thought it was stuff like muffins and pre-made items...I was wrong! I ordered the Eggs Benedict! Hands down the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had...seriously! The Eggs were cooked perfect as well as the ham. The hollandaise sauce was superb and the hash browns were cooked in BBQ sauce which was new for me and now a new favorite! It was only $10.99 and it was a huge portion. I really recommend this place to anyone who likes great food. What a surprise!! I ate at 10:30 this am and it's now 7:30 pm and I'm still full. Trust me on the Eggs Benedict! Best EVER! They have a lot of other full breakfast items and I can't wait to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 2.5 stars. It's nice, BUT... I went in during a summer evening. Reasonably quiet. Ordered a small decaff. It was....adequate, if a  smidge on the pricy side.  Personally I am not concerned if the staff are like zombies, as long as they don't toss ones credit card back to you, If they look you in the eye, say please and thankyou, then all is well.  An upside is that one tends to find lots of eye candy opposite sex wise. So, if you want to talk to a Ryan Reynold's lookalike or a Doll faced girl, there's your place!  The downside, and the thing that knocks it's half star off (if I could give 2.5 stars) is the lack of air conditioning. And effective window shades to keep the sun from knocking your head off or blinding you as it sets in the summer. I am not sure if they have AC or not. If they have, then the bizarre 'lets keep the front door open and let all the heat in/cold out' in a vain attempt to cool the place is just silly.   Close the door, turn on the AC, voila, a comfy 19c in the heights of summer. Noone likes sticky thighs syndrome on vinyl seats. I also agree with turning off the wifi during peak periods, this is a coffee shop people, not a library."}
{"text":"Possibly the best eggs Benny I've ever had. Well worth the wait at noon. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but I am a fan! Made the mistake of going there for a late breakfast on the long weekend. It was standing room only! We eventually grabbed a table, just before our food came.  The food was beautiful, and very reasonable. I had the Greek omelette. It was very fresh and the eggs were so fluffy. My bf had \"the big cup of coffee\" (bacon, eggs, toast and hash browns, comes with coffee), and he only finished 2/3's of it.  I found the coffee to be quite bitter, but I'll try a cappuccino, or latte next time. The desserts looked fabulous. Meeting a colleague here tomorrow, so will try the cheesecake!   I do like the self-serve atmosphere. Very casual. All in, our breakfast came to $21, which was amazing for what we got. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"The Purple Perk is one of my favourite coffee shops in Calgary. The atmosphere is awesome and the coffee is very good. They're quite often busy, but not so much that I've ever had to wait overly long, and have always managed to find a table when I needed one.  One thing I need to do is try the breakfasts someday - the omelette looks and smells phenomenal (not that I'm looking at or smelling other peoples' meals... ... *shifty eyes*)  Definitely a must try if you're in the area. I just wish it were open later - sometimes one needs a coffee past 10pm!"}
{"text":"Purple Perk sits in the heart of 4th Street, beside Mercato's and across the street from a Starbucks. With so many eats around, you'd never look twice at Purple Perk unless a friend recommended it.   That's how I discovered Purple Perk. Their food is mediocre for average $10 a plate. The place is often packed because of it's prime location. I see a lot of people sitting at tables for hours reading or working on their laptops. Purple Perk also doesn't seem to mind outside food since I frequently see a woman eating her own food brought in Tupperwares.   If you're in the area, you may notice Purple Perk. But you won't miss out if you walk by it. There's no shortage of better good nearby, but feel free to stay if you need to freeload."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the perk, they have hands down the best london fog in the city. Their baked goods are hit and miss in my experience, I have had a full on stale lemon square (like shattered and crumbled hard) but I have also had amazing cheese cake or a GIGANTIC slice of chocolate cake that was a delight!  I have had a meal here once or twice, and the food is surprisingly good beyond what I would expect from a coffee shop. Decent breakfast on weekends, but only worth it if you happen to catch a lull and get a table in the place.  I definitely avoid the place during peak hours though, since they seem to get crowded fast, and there never seems to be any management or someone on staff with the stones to tell that guy lurking by himself at the biggest table to pack up his lap top and go to make room for the 18 people waiting around for a table... The staff are hit and miss- always friendly for sure, but sometimes I wonder if they are just new, or don't know how to manage a rush of customers.  I really want to give this place 4 or even 5 stars, but lately I just can't... the last few times there have been stacks of dirty dishes (like, a whole day's worth! not just a few) piling up and flies circling them at the back. Flies? in November? Service is adequate, but doesn't excel.  They still make the best London Fog i can find, but more often than not I find myself wandering to another shop, unless it is late at night and I know the perk will be more or less empty...   I will still choose the perk over the chain store across the street, but I know and remember when they were so much better than lately, and I hope they realize it's time to pull up their socks a bit. Maybe pay just a little more to attain staff who know what they are doing, or who will stick around longer so that it doesn't seem like everyone in the place is on their first day..."}
{"text":"Only the location on 4th AND \"it's not Starbucks\" is what most likely keeps the Purple \"perking\".  Service and the care factor was not very high here on 02/19th at about 09:45am."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for some coffee and grab a bite to eat. They have baked sweets and also wraps and sandwiches. Something to note, there are no servers here... you need to get up, place your order and pay at the till.  Unfortunately, not all the staff are friendly... there is a guy (didn't grab his name) who didn't appear to be a happy person and completely ignored me when I approached him to ask for ketchup. I had to go around the counter and ask a girl who told me ketchup, napkins, etc, were available at a little hidden table at the back. Again, no servers here, you need to get up and grab them from there."}
{"text":"After meeting up with a friend for lunch one day in Mission and slowly meandering my way back to my truck...The Purple Perk came into view and I decided to grab a coffee.  I loved the cozy ambiance that was clearly noticeable the moment I walked through the door and while it was busy I only waited a few minutes to place & pick up my coffee order.   I was delighted to see all the lovely food offerings available but since I was still rather full from lunch I stuck with my usual cappuccino (to go).  The staff were prompt and friendly and as such I am putting this cafe on my radar to hit up the next time I am in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"After responding to the call of absolutely huge and scrumptious looking deserts, I am afraid I don't have very nice things to say about this establishment.  The cashier girl was uninspired, the food took 45 minutes to get to the table and when it did, I had to send it back to get it reheated.  The carpet looks like it just spent time at a movie theatre, and there were flies.  I am new to this obviously popular local hangout, and whenever I have passed by, it is full and animated.  Perhaps I need to return and just order a dessert and coffee?  My confusion to its popularity however has just been resolved from reading other yelper reviews; FREE WIRELESS... Duh!  I will give it two stars however, just to give Purple Perks the benefit of the doubt.  Note to self: Self... update this establishment's review in near future."}
{"text":"I haven't experienced any of the service issues others have had here.  I've simply enjoyed good coffee, decent food, ample available seating (at 4p on a weekday, though it did get a lot busier into the evening), free wifi, and plentiful people-watching (this is a popular spot, and I've seldom seen more pretty people in one cafe at any one time).  All-in-all, it's definitely a place I'll be coming back to.  The only things I'll knock it for are being a little bit grubby (in particular, the coffee condiment counter was nasty the time I was there), and for not stocking any artificial sweeteners other than Sweet 'n Low (this is a pet peeve of mine)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times were very different. The first night was a Friday evening after dinner, we ventured over for some tea and dessert, the place was relatively quiet and nice. We had some of the chocolate cake and it was really yummy. After a nice lunch yesterday, I returned for the second time and it was PACKED! Luckily we were able to score the last table, but the place was FULL of hipsters who gave me the side eye when I attempted to squeeze myself between their pushed out chairs to get to my table. Our cherry pie was average at best, and cold in the middle even though we asked them to warm it up. I did, however, have the best London Fog I've ever tasted. From now on, I think I'll avoid the Sunday crowd and just pop in for late night bevvies."}
{"text":"I've had a couple of visits to The Purple Perk now. Both visits were on a weekend, both times it's been pretty busy, yet with a lineup that moves decently fast.   During my first visit, I ordered a large Americano to go. It was ready for me to pick up before I had even paid (the girl at the register forgot to ring it in. \"That was really honest of you!\" was her answer).  My next visit I when for a small Americano and a ginger cream cookie. I ended up with a medium Americano. Hey, I'm not complaining! Just that my impression of the staff so far is that they're a little scattered, but still friendly and nice. That ginger cream cookie on the other hand... there's nothing scattered about it, except maybe the crumbs as you're eating it. Two gigantic gingerbread cookies with icing in the middle. That cookie means business! I could only finish a third of it. It took me two days to nibble my way through the rest of it.  Word on the street is that Purple Perk shuts off its wifi when it gets too busy. It's almost the standard flippant remark whenever I happen to mention it. Not sure if there's any relevance to that or not... maybe it's just a sketchy connection? I dunno, there were ppl there on their laptops on my second visit."}
{"text":"A could be nice place, ruined by its customers and location.  Coffee is quite good, cookies are yummy, but you can't really enjoy these inside.  Place is crumpled, and every tiny table for four is occupied by a random gentlebum - checking out an old newspaper, or staring into nowhere with a sense of being lost in the Universe. Forever. And when a bum is missing, the table would be cautiously squatted by a pair of eyeglasses, or a notebook, or something as valuable to remind that its owner is wandering around and may be back.  You may try to pop out and sit outside... if not for these garbage bins. See, Purple Perk is situated just at the entrance of a service alley, hosting garbage bins for a few condos and couple more restaurants. In a word, stinky.  So I'm almost sorry for them friendly girls working inside, and the actually good coffee and cookies, but unfortunately Purple Perk is only useful as a grab'n'go location, not a shop per se."}
{"text":"It's okay not my favourite spot food at front like Mac and cheese and lasagna looks dry and they heat in microwave yuck. Having raspberry and white chocolate scone it is good, but coffee not the greatest"}
{"text":"Maybe it's all the P's in the name but every time I come here I am sup-p-p-per p-p-p-productive! They have good coffee, good food (that come in giant portions I might add), and lots of seating with outlets all along the benches. The pricing is a little more expensive than your average coffee shop but it's understandable since there are people like me who just squat there for hours. They don't seem to mind how long you stay. I haven't tried a ton of their food but most of the baked goods I've tried are great and so are their chips (which are homemade). I love that this place is a cool mix between a diner and a café. The WiFi is also consistent (even better than using Shaw Open), which cannot be said for most 'WiFi' cafés. Whether you want to get some work done or you want to catch up with friends, you should plop your pants down at Purple Perk!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but I have never had that \"OMG, this is awesome!!\" moment in the 4 times I've been there.  Yay: *food and dessert selection is yummy *free wi-fi *independently owned  Blah: *tables are hard to get *service often takes a while  *honestly, not a fan of the coffee *lighting is weird (can't relax & can't work well)  I will come back if I need to be in Mission to meet up with someone, but only because I'd rather support a local business than the Starbucks across the road."}
{"text":"Heard that the chocolate cake's good. So finally went to pick it up after work couple days ago.  I ordered an iced mocha and a piece of chocolate cake. The iced mocha was not good, and the chocolate cake was DRY, very disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Perk is only partially about a great cup of coffee. WIth free wi-fi and staff that doesn't mind how long you stay, The Perk is all about getting your work done and making connections.   The Coffee: Good. A medium Americano rings in at $2.52 so it is right around average in price.   The Food: Sometimes amazing, sometimes bland. The daily soup is usually pretty delicious, but some of the meals lack flavour. Having said this, they might know and just don't care, because there are always at least three bottles of hot sauce out. The desserts are exactly what you want, I'd travel from any corner of the city for a Perk lemon square.  The atmosphere: You can go and get work done. You can go and make some pretty sweet connections if you are in the marketing/design/web/journalism space. You can laugh with friends. Just...don't look at the bench seat too closely, it is getting kind of rough.  My one bad experience: I order a Chicken Perk wrap one time and it only had cabbage inside. It was a Saturday - to be honest, the kid in the kitchen was probably hung over, it was somewhat endearing. They immediately made me another one."}
{"text":"Warm food and free wifi -- both are crucial on a cold, winter's eve for a Calgary traveler. The Purple Perk offers both!  While visiting YEG for a work trip, I happened to be in the neighborhood and looking for somewhere to get some computing done, while having a decent meal. The glow of the lights drew me in and once I saw jambalaya on the menu, I was enticed to stay.  \"Jambalaya in Calgary, 'eh?\" is what I heard in my mind. But Purple Perk's version is good! Having been to New Orleans, I wouldn't say it's the most authentic version, but it was warm, everything in the bowl was cooked and the jalapeno corn bread added some extra pizzaz.  With the location and the wifi, the joint was packed! But it seems like people come and go frequently, so finding a table wasn't too bad. And I was only there for about 45 minutes, leaving the space for someone else to take.   A nice coffee shop with a full menu isn't always the easiest to find. The Purple Perk more than served its purpose."}
{"text":"Haha, man, everytime I go on one of these review maniac writing things (like I write 3 in a row, and I'm taxed), I realize how overly pedestrian my taste is. I go to the same places as the rest of you yuppies. That includes the Purple Perk which is the place every young chick with a fancy tattoo or an elderly couple coasting in from a fun scooter ride go for a cup of ho-hum coffee, and below average service.  As far as cafes go, it's a decent place. Lots of space, free wi-fi, decent menu, and a good custard flan. But as far as the excellent cafe scene in Calgary goes, Purple Perk is below average. If you're on 4th St., you do have limited options, as I think there is just a Starbucks, Good Earth (or Second Cup), and that terribly overpriced Italian bistro that I can never remember the name of.  Go here if you need something silly that you can only buy on 4th St., like organic bath salts or laser eye surgery. Or if you live here, I guess.  Oh yeah, and I just want to add that Gabe A. is right. I never use free wifi, and I actually don't see it as a plus. I know you kids that work in cafes like it, but I don't."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a cup of coffee when you're strolling around on 4 St on a Sunday afternoon. A big draw seems to be the free Wi-Fi (which I will likely never in my life get around to using), though it does have blackout periods. There were quite a few people studying, so the tables were hard to get at, and with the nice weather, it was best to forget trying for their outdoor seating.  Food-wise, it was unexceptional. The latte was serviceable, and fell far short of P&S's, though their strawberry cheesecake was moist and delicious. A good independently owned business to support if you're in the area, but not a place I would go out of my way to."}
{"text":"Great coffee and baked goods here! I have never stayed for lunch or breakfast but what i have seen while getting coffee always looks great."}
{"text":"A great place to hang out for a cup of java.  They have a decent selection of hot foods and desserts too.  Their cheesecake is amazing.  I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm an on-again/off-again fan. The coffee is better than the place across the street. Treats are delicious (and very bad for me - lol) Lunch and sandwiches are terrific.  Free wifi and a great vibe make this place a go-to coffee shop in the area. Not as much character as it used to have.  The staff/service are average and often distracted. Most of all, the place needs a serious reno. Banquets need re-upholstering. It's just so popular that everything is worn out. A good problem to have but one that needs to be addressed asap!!!"}
{"text":"Purple Perk is, first of all, adorable. A cute, classic \"diner\"-style little coffeeshop (wow, that's a lotta adjectives!).  I like the coffee and the food is pretty good. I first had breakfast here a REALLY long time ago (hardly remember, except that I liked it) but I have had the baking more recently. It is somewhat unique, tasty, and usually large portions!  In my opinion, Purple Perk is well worth dropping by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I have been coming to purple perk for years.  I used to work on my leases for property managing outside on the patio and now I work on my contracts for my fast growing commercial cleaning business.  It's so great not being here for a while and the girls knew that I liked a different sweet sauce with my always yummy Thai beef wrap.  It's great to come into a super clean coffee place with nice familiar faces and great food. Keep it up and see you soon !"}
{"text":"To start they had no issue with our dog hanging outside the outdoor seating.  That's a plus.  My wife had the Greek for me omelette.  The spinach was clearly from a can.  Points lost for ingredient selection.  The eggs Benedict I had came with an aftertaste of cooking oil(not butter).  For the $30 breakfast I expected better.  It will be awhile before we return."}
