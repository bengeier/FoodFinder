{"text":"I wasn't expecting much, I'm not the kind of person who expects the world from a tiny Chinese place with a name like 'Oh Yummy', but what I got was far from even 'Oh Cafeteria'.

We ordered delivery, two kinds of lo mein, peanut chicken, and orange beef. It did arrive fairly quickly, so at least nobody slaved over our meal.

The lo meins weren't even that- they were unseasoned spaghetti with flavorless meat mixed in. No veggies, just green onion that completely overpowered it and made the entire dish taste like nothing but onion and possibly some ginger. The portion was big, but I at least expected some kind of seasoning on the noodles or some cabbage. Something to give it a little flavor.

The peanut chicken was bland, just a vaguely peanutty mess with a miserable sticky sauce. This was the first box I opened, and I immediately realized lunch wasn't going to be a fun time when I came face to face with it.

The orange beef was stunningly bad as well. At first glance and taste it seemed okay, pretty generic and overly sweet but not anything horrible. However, once we started to eat it we realized the beef was tough as shoelaces and the coating- I hesitate to call it breading or sauce- dissolved into a thick pasty glue that immediately stuck to my teeth and took a good minute of licking to remove.

Another note, and this isn't really bad so much as weird, is that the delivery woman came up to our back porch and knocked rather than the front door. I'm not really sure why she did, but we almost didn't hear her at all. Maybe we would have been better off that way. Again, not really a complaint, just a strange thing that added to the sad experience.

I'm a good deal pickier than the rest of my family so they managed to finish their meals, but all of their reasons for doing so were said through clenched teeth, and by the end of it they were all complaining just as much as I had. 

On the plus side, the soda was cold."}
{"text":"Ordered in from this little quaint Chinese restaurant expecting it to be terrible due to it's appearance.. But as they say , don't judge a book by it's cover (cliché much?). Very generous portions, food is exactly what you want it to be on a 'who cares about my diet.. Get me greasy food now!' kind of day, and prices are decent.

Also I must say, awesome owners!"}
{"text":"La soupe hot and sour est vraiment la meilleure que j'aie mangé. Le chef est venu nous parler pour s'assurer que tout était va notre goût ce qui était le cas. Le buf au brocoli plat assez traditionnel était très bon aussi. Le look de l'endroit est ordinaire mais le repas vaut la peine. Je recommande!"}
