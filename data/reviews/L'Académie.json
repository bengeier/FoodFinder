{"text":"Bland food, blasé waiter (who forgot half our order).
Went twice for group events... would never go back."}
{"text":"Not a bad BYOB. We ended up there on a busy Saturday night, but we were seated within five minutes for a group of ten. Service was slow at parts. The bread was good though (fresh and still warm). I ordered a Filet mignon, and it was delicious (nice and tender with great flavors). Pricing is a little high for small portions though (I would have expected slightly more sides with the beef. Overall, food is good, service is slow, price is a little high. Not a bad place to start off an evening with friends."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time at this nice bring your own bottle place.  There is a provincial liquor store across the street and we chose a Mouton Rothchild white and a 2004 Chateau Labegorce Margaux red.

To start, we had escargot, fried calamari and mussels.  Soup du jour was a veggie puree.  Two had beef and I chose duck.  Red meat was tender but breast was a bit tough."}
{"text":"crazy lines but decent food, not much for vegetarians though"}
{"text":"Visited L'Acadamie with my mother recently since I had been here once before and remembered it was a BYOB. The restaurant can be deceiving from the outside but there are three stories and it can handle a lot of people. We went somewhat early on a Friday night and it was packed already. Since there are three floors the noise level got to be a bit much but it wasn't the reason why I would only give this place two stars. 

I ordered the mussels Marinier and my mother ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola. The meal was pretty good, food wise but the service was terrible. There was one guy who gave us water and bread, another guy that opened our bottle of wine and then a third who was our actual waiter. Not once after receiving our food did our waiter return to check on our food or ask us if we needed anything but he had to pass our table multiple times in order to bring out food to other tables, clear things, etc. so it wasn't like we were in the back of the restaurant and he had forgotten about us--it just showed he didn't care. 

Since we were planning on having a leisurely dinner anyways we didn't realize how late it was and how long we had been sitting there after finishing our food until all the wine was gone and we had run out of things to say. In total, we were there for 1 1/2 hours! It took us nearly 10 minutes to try and get our waiter's attention just to get the cheque! And when we did he started to clear our dishes and took away my mom's pasta dish which was more than half uneaten without asking if she wanted it wrapped up--we thought it was very rude of him to assume that an uneaten plate of food was to be tossed in the dumpster. He also did not ask if we wanted dessert or coffee/tea which meant he made less on the tip. Overall, terrible service from our waiter (Adil) and since we had to fight tooth and nail to get his attention, my mom thought he deserved no tip at all. He never once checked up on us, asked if we needed anything, nor did he generally show that he was working for his pay. This is the first time we haven't left a tip but he deserved it."}
{"text":"Great meal with very good service. The waiter was very helpful and gave many suggestions for our trip. It is BYOB and the liquor store across the street was very convenient. Nice atmosphere and good experience."}
{"text":"Went here with my co-workers.  Excellent food.  We bought wine across the street at the SAQ and took it to dinner.  No corkage fees, must be a Montreal thing.  I've been twice now and have had consistently good meals of mussels and duck."}
{"text":"Pros:
-BYOB = save lots of money especially in a big group
-Complimentary bread was good, better than most others
-Relatively cheap prices compared to other fancy restaurants: most entrees were under $30 and appetizers under $10 each.

Cons:
-You get what you pay for, food was sub par: I ordered a medium-rare fillet mignon and it was tough as nails. My friend ordered a medium regular steak and it was actually more tender than mine. 

-Portions were meager, expect to go home with half a stomach full of bread.

-Other friend ordered frog legs and it was not marinated at all so it was bland even after numerous dippings in sauce, I know because I also tried a piece, so did half the table. It was so bad that she could not finish half the dish and after we complained to the waitress, she waived the entree off her bill.

-Very noisy atmosphere for a fancy restaurant, probably due to the 3 storey design."}
{"text":"We went t St-Denis location yesterday for our anniversary.
I took a soup and Roquefort mussels, my husband took smoked salmon and spaghetti bolognese. 

In the beginning it was good, the starters arrived fast and they were quite good. 
However, after they took our plates away we waited for about 1h (!!) for the main course. It looked like everyone around us who arrived 0-30 minutes later than us was served much earlier than we were. Being still hungry we even ate all the bread while waiting. Not my preferred source of calories, to be honest.

When the main courses finally arrived, we received no apology or anything like that from the waiter. She acted like nothing happened at all. 

On the bright side, mussels were really tasteful, big and meaty, and the sauce was delicious. I wish I didn't have to eat that much bread waiting for them. In the end I couldn't finish my meal because of that. 
I would note that they could have put more fries on the side. The quantity was fine with me, but for someone with bigger appetite or someone who didn't take an appetizer it might have not been enough.

My husband was not as lucky, his spaghetti were very mediocre, the sauce tasted more like stuff from a can. He merely finished a half of it.
And oh, food presentation was also very poor.

We left without coffee or dessert because after 2h+ meal we weren't sure how long it would take them to serve dessert and we didn't want to miss our train.

All in all, I wouldn't go back to the same location, but I would give it another try in T-Can location that's closer to my home to see if the experience will be different. 
The mussels were indeed great, the atmosphere was nice and casual, and the bill ($40) was  reasonable for what we got."}
{"text":"Normally this place was OK. But we went there recently and the service and food were both Disgusting.  

Our server was an Asian guy who told us the calamari was only \"pretty good\" but better than the muscles. 

That was the vibe to start our night: a server who didn't even like the food. So we ordered with that great attitude as our starting point.

We got snails, calamari, and the cannelloni.

Snails were good.

Calamari was rubbery.

Cannelloni (after waiting very long time and offered more bread to compensate) tasted microwaved, rubbery. 

The server then got mad at us for complaining, saying that him and the staff tasted the food and it was fine.  (btw, we NEVER usually complain.. takes a lot for us to complain).   

When he brought the bill, he said that next time he would charge us for food we return.

There won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Walking up St-Denis one night looking for a place to eat we passed restaurant after restaurant, hemming and hawing about what to choose, and finally we spotted L'Academie and remembered it as being on a list of recommendations and so we dove right in.

It was fantastic, a great save for Montreal after several mediocre dining experiences.  The food was excellent, just outstanding, and the atmosphere was very comfortable on the third level, in a nice quiet area.

I'd love to go back."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feeling about l'Academie.  I've eaten here on four different occasions, and every time it's been a completely different experience.  Everything from the food to the service to the entire restaurant atmosphere can vary greatly.  

The last time I was there the service was impeccable.  Despite it being a busy Friday night, we were seated swiftly in a quiet area.  The waiter quickly brought us water, opened our bottle of wine, and poured us glasses.  I had several questions concerning the menu (high cholesterol makes one ask about the butter and cream content of dishes - sometimes something that looks like it won't be cream heavy is...) that were answered with expertise.  When our waiter didn't know, he promised to go and ask the chef; he returned within 3 minutes with a detailed answer.  

I decided to go with the tuna steak with coriander-lime vinaigrette; I had ordered this dish on a previous occasion and had been much impressed that they had cooked it per my request.  Unfortunately, I don't think the dish I was served on this second occasion had anything in common with the first.  I asked for my tuna to be cooked rare, almost blue.  I order tuna at restaurants because I find that the slight searing beautifully complements that raw interior; it's like sushi but better.  Unfortunately, the steak of tuna that was brought was cooked all the way through, to an extent that it was almost chewy and tough.  It was like tuna out of a can, but worse.  

My companion ordered a filet mignon cooked rare; alas, his dish was similar to mine.  The sauces were very nice, but the fact that the meat was so overcooked destroyed the whole dish.  I hate to be left wanting when I'm paying $25 for a dish, yet that is what happened.

However, on the other hand, I have had some very good meals here.  The first time around, the tuna was cooked to perfection, as was my friend's steak.  The gnocchi with blue cheese is a delightful dish; I would probably order it every time, if I did not have that slight aversion to cream.  The rest of the pastas are fairly standard, nothing incredible, but a decent meal for a decent price.  I've only had Moules et Frites once, but it was incredible.  I polished off every last morsel in the largest bowl of mussels that I've ever tackled.  The veal is again a hit and miss dish; I've seen people rave about it, and I've seen  left on the plate.  

In conclusion, this restaurant gets three stars because of its high variability.  I've had a meal here that I would give five stars, but another that I would give one.  My suggestion is to stick with the pasta and the Moules et Frites; they're a little bit cheaper, come in generous portions, and tend not to disappoint."}
{"text":"We ended up at L'academie kind of randomly, and while the food was alright it wasn't really memorable either.

We did a fondue Parmesan to start, which was apparently a fancy fried cheese stick, then a pasta and tuna dish for mains. Both were good, but very straightforward preparations with nothing really standing out. On a street packed with such excellent restaurants, I think it's tough to recommend this one."}
{"text":"This was a nightmare ! Accused to be a thief in a restaurant for not leaving traditional 15% tip for services I was totally dissatisfied with !?

I went for dinner on a Monday. We were so hungry we would have eaten even on the side walk. We brought our favorite wine and with a super good mood we stepped in L'Academie St Denis.

We ordered one of the specials (mussels) and duck (which is actually one of their top offers). The service was incredibly slow! I had to ask 2 times to have my bottle of wince opened. In the end another waiter showed up to fill with water and, after he did his job, he returned to open the bottle. As it was a white wine I asked for a cooler with it, which came after another good waiting time (we were half way through our bottle). We ordered out choices and he didn't mentioned to us that the special comes with a soup or a salad. I had to call him again to tell him what I just found out from the next table and order the soup. It looks like eating in a place where tabled are jammed pack one next to the other is a good thing after all. 

The food was ready in a decent time (or maybe it was just the wine to make the wait look short). The soup was good, mussels were very good (but I noticed they reduced the portions comparing with before), the duck was average with canned-like sauce.

So much sauce, so much grease ... I asked for more bread. It seemed to us we could have jumped naked on a table not to catch the attention of our waiter. Another waiter came with the bread.

We were so not happy with the service. Everything I asked was like a battle: had to literally wave to catch his attention, every time he came with something he was throwing them on the table. He looked like if I were to bother him more he would spit on food before bringing in.
Anyway, we made it through and we asked for the bill right away, no desert as we had too much (too much of a bad service).

So now the nightmare part! We decided to leave him exactly 10% of the price before taxes. This would have been an alarm bell to struggle to provide a better service next time. It seems like he didn't need any bell. He didn't pick the paper slip from the table but he put his finger on it to point to the tip! And then he explained me what the price is, where the taxes are, where the total is and where the tip line is. I told him I knew all that and that is all for his services. 

He  actually had the guts to bargain with me: \"What, that's it!? For the whole night!? You asked me to bring you that, open you that, more that...and that's it!?\" So I told him \"You know, guess what? Now that you mentioned it ....\" and I took the slip back from him to adjust the tip. He literally pulled out the paper slip from my hand and started to scream (yes to scream): \"You know how this is called? This is stealing!\" I said \"That's it! I want to talk with you manager!\" Of course he left and never called the manager but just continue with the other tables. I asked another 2 waiters until the manager actually was told to come at out table. I asked him to bring back my slip where I adjusted the tip to zero. I explained him the situation and left the decision to him.

Accused to be a thief in a restaurant for not leaving traditional 15% tip for services I was totally dissatisfied with!?"}
{"text":"Un des restaurants que j'aime beaucoup à Montréal. Oui, le service est lent, mais le choix de nourriture est varié et j'ai rarement été déçu par les différents plats que j'y ai essayés. Un bon endroit pour des groupes, autant que pour un tête à tête ou une soirée avec la famille ou des amis."}
{"text":"Plutot decevant comme experience. A plusieurs reprises, nous avons du demander pour du services. Malgres que courtois, les serveurs nous servaient des excuses bidons pour expliquer le delais. Il semblerait qu'un steak bien cuit a besoin d'Une demi-heure, voir plus... Pourtant, les patates etaient encore dures. Le steak, lui, etait carbonise, alors que le fois meduim-saignant etait bien cuit... A croire que leur evaluation est un peu biaisee. Apportez quelques bouteilles pour profiter du temps d'attente."}
{"text":"L'Académie est connu pour ses pâtes. J'ai eu la chance d'y manger une fois en groupe. La présence de 8 assaisonnements différents pour les moules marinières m'a inspiré et j'ai ainsi pris des moules plutôt que des pâtes. Quelle déception de voir arriver les moules froides. Mon évaluation aurait une étoile supplémentaire si le plat avait été servi chaud et une autre étoile si l'endroit était à la fois plus lumineux et moins étriqué."}
{"text":"I am so surprised at all the negative reviews. This is a place we have been known to queue up in the snow to eat at. It is always on our itinerary when we visit Montreal. A trip up there without dining at L'academie would feel incomplete. I have never had a bad meal here. I usually get one or another variety of the moules et frites. I'm a big fan of the curry ones but most of the ones I've tried have been fab. The penne a' la vodka is delicious too as are the grilled langoustines. The restaurant is BYOB and there's an SAQ conveniently right across the street. I much prefer to come here during lunch. It's a little cheaper, you avoid the crazy dinner queue, and it's less manic. Plus I love to sit by an open window on a sunny afternoon and enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I will continue coming here every time I come to Montreal. I have had consistently good service and food quality, the place is always lively but not overcrowded, and it's in a great location. 

Come on a Sunday-Wednesday night as the pasta and mussel dishes are half off those nights! It's an amazing deal and the BYOB policy saves a bunch of money as well, plus the SAQ is right across the street. 

Have fun and bring lots of wine!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here today!!  We had an awesome seat right by the windows, which were wide open because of the beautiful weather today!  The garlic snails were yummy and the mussels and fries were to die for!  We ordered the baumande and Provençal, both were cooked to perfection!  The price is also easy on your wallet (can't beat $14 mussels and fries).  The restaurant does not serve alcohol but it allows BYOB, so our meal went well with our white wine!  Ambiance is excellent and service is unbeatable!  Our server, Anthony, is very kind, attentive and helpful!

Highly recommend and would definitely return!  :)"}
{"text":"Beau restaurant avec de la nourriture délicieuse et abordable! Personnel très gentil. Par contre, quand j'y suis allée, il y avait une réservation de plus de 80 personnes pour une initiation d'université et non seulement c'était très bruyant (même si la réservation était sur l'autre étage) et le service était lent. Je recommande tout de même, j'ai pris des pâtes au saumon qui étaient délicieuses et c'est un \"apportez votre vin\"."}
{"text":"I was 2 years ago that I had been here. The lasagna was so yummy that I cannot forget."}
{"text":"Not the best pasta dishes but it's good for the price you pay. I think they have a special on some days of the week, so people love that. Its also a byow so if you're looking for a filling meal paired with a bottle of wine, it's perfect."}
{"text":"J'avais entendu parler de l'Académie, en bien et en mal. Une amie a proposé ce restaurant pour une soirée d'amies d'Université, pourquoi pas ! Nous pouvions apporter notre vin (important pour un budget serré)

Points + : La place est joliment située au coin de duluth, le 2e donne une vue magnifique sur la rue st-denis, le restaurant est propre, les employés sont gentils et prompt à répondre aux demandes. 

points - : Le prix des assiettes compense pour l'alcool ... Plusieurs d'entre nous avons pris des moules (recommandées par le serveur). 2 d'entre nous , dont moi, avons eu une intoxication alimentaire ce soir-la... et une autre fille a croqué du sable a plusieurs reprises... moyen. Aussi, ils ne prennent pas la carte de débit ? Quel restaurant franchisé d'envergure ne prend pas la carte ? Nous devons retirer d'un guichet ATM ( avec frais, bien sur ! )

Je suis vraiment mitigée, un restaurant offrant des moules et ne sachant pas les faire de la bonne façon ne mérite pas que j'y retourne, pourtant, je serais prête a essayer les pâtes si j'avais a y retourner.

déception !"}
{"text":"A great apportez-votre-vin pre-going out dinner spot. The food can be hit or miss. The moule are usually my option of choice.  Try to arrive early, as they don't take reservations. With a large group, you can spend a long time hanging around, drinking your own wines and get the bill just in time for the clubs down the street to open up. Classic french cuisine at cheaper than expected prices."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant to go to in a group! It is BYOB which is great, so you can share a bottle with your friends or to yourself. The portions are very big and you get more than what you pay for. The food is decent, but it's not the best. Since the portions are very big, you can take the rest of your meal back home. The mussels and fries are pretty good."}
{"text":"Charming place, great menu, nice to BYOW. The escargots are a favorite starter, and their main courses are prepared with care and always delicious. And the prices are surprisingly reasonable, even with the crummy exchange rates for USD. I try to go for dinner here at least once when I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best place we dined in while inontreal. Also a good people watcher place. Good service and fine food.  Definitely the place to see and be seen. Uber urbane"}
{"text":"I spent one long afternoon for lunch here. The place was empy and airy, bright considering it was grey and wet outside. Such a pleasant place to sit and watch Montreal stroll easily in the rain. I ordered caesar salad, it was nothing special. Definitely in the lower range of my caesar rating. The linguini dish that came later was not a disappointment, but just OK. 
I started to wander why there were always crowds in front of this restaurant before dinner? The food was nothing to brag about. It must be the space and the BYOB, with SAC right next door and all."}
{"text":"I suppose it's a good place if you like bringing your own booze, otherwise they pressure you to order lots of food and the food is not really the showcase. I had the pasta and the price was right, but there are just better options."}
{"text":"Oh, how I miss you, L'acadamie!  I love your mussels and the BYOB option, and I've shared some good meals with good friends at your tables.  The wait, however, is killer... although usually quite worth it."}
{"text":"I'm rating this on behalf of my friends and I, because a lot of what they ordered during our latest visit helped with the overall rating.

BYOB/AVV is the popular thing to do, and it's convenient that there's a nearby store to pick up a bottle.  It's always busy and loud around dinner time so avoid coming here if you want to have a quiet dinner.  No doubt, the goings on at other tables could stimulate conversation at your own table.

If you like seafood, the mussels are a must.  This is where my friend's dishes come in to play.  Each of them ordered a different mussel dish and were surprised at how many mussels they received on their plate and how delicious their plates' respective sauces were.  I've always ordered a pasta dish and have never been disappointed with my choices.

Service has always been pretty good every time.  The wait staff is generally attentive (and they don't look that bad either).  The chairs are quite comfy even though seating is a bit tight.  Prices were pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service.  It's BYO and there's a liquor store right next door, so while you wait to be seated, which can take upwards of an hour, you can peruse the wine selection, which while not huge is good enough for the untrained palate.  
The second we were taken to our table, the waitress took our wine, opened and iced it.  I was impressed by their attention to detail when they weren't getting tipped for the alcohol purchase nor charged a corking fee.  America take a hint! 
The pasta was great, as were the mussels.  I remember their gnocchi being fantastic as well.  I tried their dessert, but don't remember what I went with but that it was good.  The food was awesome, and it definitely didn't break the bank.  The same meal in the same restaurant across the border would cost significantly more.  Worth the trip and the wait!"}
{"text":"I have almost nothing good to say about this place. Other than you can bring your own wine and that they didn't make me pay for the food I sent back, I don't have anything positive to say. The food was horrible and if you are gluten free, I would stay away. Yes there are a few gf items like pasta but none of their sauces are gf! So what are you supposed to eat??? dry pasta. I ordered the chicken masala, without the sauce obviously and it was so dry. The server and manager tried to tell me it was dry because there was no sauce. BS! The chicken was dry because it was overcooked! My friend ordered the same think, with sauce, and her chicken was also not edible because it was so overcooked. I can't believe they tried to blame dry chicken on no sauce! My husband ordered the mussels with lemon, it was basically mussels in water with lemon slices. Even though they were cooked properly, he said they didn't taste good, they had no flavor. Most of our group left disappointing and with half full plates because the food was gross. I will never be back here and would never recommend it."}
{"text":"we tried the fettuccine Primavera and the risotto with duck.

The fettucini was very bland.  Neither of us could work up any enthusiasm for it.

The Risotto did not have a single piece of duck in it.  I asked the waiter about this and he brought me another. It was excellent.  We should have sent back the Primavera.  

So they can get things right if they try.  
But that should be their job, not ours."}
{"text":"Situé à quelques patés de maison de mon appart (pendant mon Erasmus), c'est un MUST DO de Saint-Denis, je vois pas mal de commentaires négatifs et bien moi, je n'ai jamais été déçu. L'académie, c'est un restaurant où les serveurs sont en phase d'apprentissage, d'où le nom je pense. 

On peut y apporter sa propre bouteille de vin (contre un droit de bouchon) et on y trouve différentes sortes de pâtes et de moules (?). Le cadre est classe et sympa et accessible à de grand groupe. Idéal pour aller manger avant une bonne grosse soirée.

Moi j'aime bien :D"}
{"text":"Cuisine inégale, rapport qualité prix médiocre."}
{"text":"Just so we're clear, we came on a Sunday for 3 dinner reasons. 1st: For a family, they have a kid friendly menu. 2nd: I had been to l'acadamie in Gatineau for lunch on business and thought it the best/nicest BYOB restaurant I had been to next to Portofino, which is great, but neither cheap nor kid friendly, 3rd: I thought it good value, and had heard they had legendary Carrot Cake, which I love, in the Montreal locations. 

We had planned on going to the one in Brossard, but couldn't actually find it. (Apparently it is in the Champlain Mall, which was closed) Since committed, we settled on St. Denis for its hood vibe/funkiness. Place was packed to the rafters,so we waited. Wife and daughters dropped a small fortune at Lush while I waited, which is the mixed curse and blessing of being in a funky neighbourhood. A little annoying was we could see 5 tables for 4 with only 2 people at them. So the shopping at Lush killed the value proposition. 

When we did get a table, we were packed in between huge groups, and the waitress clearly had her hands full and she told us as much when she stopped by our table. 

The Busgirl came by and introduced herself, served some bread. opened our wine, and said she would take our drink order until the waitress was free, then to her credit came back 3min later to say she just got promoted to waitress. She was friendly and courteous, though clearly strung out. 

We ordered Calamari and Eggplant Parmesan. The Calamari and aioli served with it were inoffensive, but a little greasy,  bland and went unfinished. The Eggplant tasted excellent, but was lukewarm at best, cold by the end of it, but we did finish it. 

Kids had $5 pasta of their choice; value prop way back up.  We ordered Penne de Triesti and Mussels Madagascar. By the time they came, wife was no longer hungry, just as well, pasta was also lukewarm, but mussels were good, fries are great. meals were $12.95 and $13.95 respectively, which if they were warm, would have been more than worth it.  

All in all, the vibrant location, with a SAQ Liquor store across the street that was STILL open at 9:00 on a Sunday night, is great. The food and service are when not slammed I'm going to assume is good, but hardly great. I still think the value high, the only outlier to that being the Cake, at $7.00 a slice. Kids and I would go back in a heartbeat ... wife... probably not!"}
{"text":"The quintessential French restaurant. If you want to give an out-of-towner a speedy does of French-style cuisine, you can't go wrong with L'Academie. It skirts the line between a high-quality bistro and a cheap BYOW restaurant; just a few blocks from Prince Arthur and ten times the quality of any of the tourist traps there.

I have never had to wait long to seat a modestly-sized party; the waiters are harried and busy but generally leave you alone to drink the wine you bring from the SAQ across the street. The food is hit-or-miss; nothing horrible, and nothing exceptional (except the mussels which are to die for). When eating with guests, I recommend one of you order the frog's legs (just to give that French twist) but order some mussels for your guests. The pasta is okay, nothing good. The desserts are nice.

If I'm hard up for a place to take friends and I'm looking for a nice place to settle into a wine-induced stupor, I'll always pick L'Academie."}
{"text":"Overrated, not worth the lineup, yet I still like going there occasionally. Why? It's quick, convenient, a good place for groups, and, most importantly, it's BYO.  Call it fast food bistro food. I'd say avoid the upscale stuff on the menu (not worth it) and stick to the pasta or the mussels.  Personally, I always eat the mussels which are pretty good, if not spectacular (although I avoid them during the warmer months when you tend to get the fat mushy kinds that have the consistency of glue). One of the challenges of the place is to slow down the too fast service which generally tries to clear you out of there as soon as possible to make way for the hordes lined up outside waiting to get in. Bring lots of bottles of wine and keep drinking them so they can't get rid of you."}
{"text":"BYOB.  Expensive.  Bad food.  Bad service.  Great atmosphere.  Good location.

I'm sorta sad this place didn't burn down when the restaurant next door burnt down.  It is a shame because that next door restaurant was better in every single way except atmosphere."}
{"text":"It saddens me that this place has such subpar reviews. This was the first restaurant my friends and I landed in after getting sadly rejected by another restaurant down the street. We had just driven for a few hours and just wanted to eat. First of all, this place is three stories. Holy crap. But not only is it three stories, the service was SPECTACULAR for us. We ordered the food and it came out in less than half an hour. We had escargot, mussels in some sort of sauce with cognac I think??, duck in raspberry sauce, and seared tuna. I honestly cannot speak more highly of the food.

The duck in raspberry sauce was genius. Never would I ever have thought of something so clever. The mussels in the cognac broth was also really different but such a creative way of cooking mussels. 

I think my favorite part of the meal was when we asked for the dessert menu and the waiter just walked out with an entire tray of desserts. That was pretty sick. We ended up not ordering dessert, but the overal dining experience was fine. 

Honestly, I really don't understand why this place has such poor reviews on Yelp. It's a really solid find, and even though we went on a busy Friday night, we were still able to get seated in a packed restaurant and we got food within a reasonable, actually quick, amount of fine. 

tldr; great place, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone as a solid dinner option in Montreal"}
{"text":"Food was extremely under whelming. I ordered gnocchi dish and it was so poorly made.. So dry, hard, and starchy. And my friend ordered a sausage tomato pasta dish.. It looked so home made.. Don't waste your money.. Didn't do justice, I took a few bites and asked for the check"}
{"text":"Bon, mais rien d'exceptionnel. Sauf la soupe d'entrée, un régal (la même que celle que fait ma mamie !!)
Pour le reste, les plats ne sont pas à la hauteur des prix affichés... (dans la partie haute des $$)"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service is so-so. It is a so-called fast / semi fine dining. What can you expect from a bring-your-own-wine place?"}
{"text":"A good BYOB if you're a big group. The restaurant is so massive that they can sit pretty well any size group anytime. Also, they don't ask you leave after you're done, so you can keep on drinking.

By no means is this a bad place, I just tend to gravitate towards places with really amazing food. L'academie is reasonable food and a reasonable price, not some place I'd go if I'm looking for a special night out."}
{"text":"Ok I would probably give this a 1 star based on food alone. They used to have an amazing gnocci but now have removed it from the menu (why???) so I got the fettuccine alfredo which was....... not good. honestly felt sick after eating it. Just not flavourful at all. So food is not so good, but where this place makes up for it is the experience, when you go with friends with one bottle of wine each really nothing beats that. It's better to go Sunday-Wednesday nights though as the pasta prices are nearly half off!!! It's crazy actually to think that they try to charge $17 for that awful fettuccine alfredo on weekends... absurd."}
{"text":"The space is huge and many tables are right by the window overlooking the street. We had escargot, mussels and a rose pasta and everything was delicious! Can't beat a BYOV either."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets pretty decent ratings from me for its ability to accommodate so many patrons, very decent food and providing all this for reasonable pricing.

Despite the restaurant itself having a pretty modern and hip decor where they could easily follow other restaurants in the trend of charging higher for style instead of substance, they have had enough restraint to keep the prices decent.

The BYO aspect also make it decent as you can easily provide as much liquor as you want for your meal without getting charged a restaurant markup for your wine.

The food they serve is a fusion of Italian and French and while no dish really stood out as being truly innovative for fusion, their dishes are tasty enough to warrant repeated visits.

They are most famous for their Moule Frites which a few friends who were with me decided to order and were more than happy with.

I ended up getting the special Chicken Supreme which had a pretty comical name in my opinion but turned out to be quite delicious.

It was a chicken stuffed with canneberge, caramelized apple sauce and pears.

The desserts were all very delicious with Tiramisu being the fan favorite at our table.

Service was attentive and efficient, with finished plates always being cleaned up within minutes of completion.  This might have something to do with the long lines that this place can see, although at no point during the meal did we feel rushed."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars right down the middle. They never accomplished a top performance. But they are consistently good enough. 

For the money and considering its a bring your own wine, L'Academie gets a C grade! Why eat at home when you can go out for a minimal cost?"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but there was an enormous problem. Both my girlfriend and I , who ate there for our fourth anniversary dinner, had the absolute worst food poisoning of our lives after the meal. And we know exactly what it was-we split an order of the fried calamari. It was the only thing we shared all night and it was delicious, but six hours later it hit us and we were in for about 16 hours of nearly non-stop vomitting and other unpleasantness (which was made much worse by the fact that we had to take the train home that day). In fact I just woke up after passing out immediately on arrival and sleeping for 15 hours. Absolutely ruined the second half of our vacation."}
{"text":"Friends had a dinner for all their wedding guests from out-of-town here a few years back.  Great experience, and the BYO aspect made it not such a killing when the check came nay hours later.

Warranted a return visit on a recent trip up with a friend - and happy to say that, while I missed the atmosphere of a bunch of people coming together to share in our friends' happiness, even just a simple dinner for 2 completely satisfied.

the soupe aux poireaux took me back to my teenage days in Wallonie.  The moules as well.  Service was bang on, and the line up was long but we were sat relatively quickly."}
{"text":"Bring your own wine and hang out in a trendy location in the plateau! The veal scallopini is good. as well as the lobster bisque! The lines are long but if you go on a nice summer evening it's not such a bother as it's a busy fun street with lots to look at!  Good for the younger crowd who don't mind hanging around waiting."}
{"text":"Ate here last Friday night along with my girlfriend when visiting Montreal. It was a recommended resturant from a local that I work with. It did not dissapoint. 

Showed up at around 8:30 pm with no reservation. Was givne a table about 3 minutes later... 

This resturant allows you to bring your own wine, I did not know that.. I got up and went over quickly to the liquor store directly across the street, and got a nice bottle of California red. Don't show up without a bottle to this place.. it's goes great with the food!

The bread they serve complimentary was delicious! I had more than my fair share. 


We both opeted for the set menu that included soup and a coffee/tea at the end. We also had a couple of tapas - the calamari which was served chilled, and another which I can't remember, but it was also excellent. (not listed online)

The soup we had was a lime and watercrest based soup, and it was very good. 

I had the 1/2 rack of ribs and beef dish with frites.. The ribs were excellent, the beef was okay.. The fries were perfect. 

My girlfriend had the salmon dish - it was excellent. 

Portions here are very large, atypical of a French resturant or one that you find in Montreal. 

Our waiter even offered to give us cappacinos even though it was not included. We ate a ton of food, and the bill was about $70 before tip..

This place will be repeated when we return next time to Montreal."}
{"text":"This is my favourite middle class restaurant. Every time I come here I always receive quality service and excellent gourmet cuisine. They hosted an event for the McGill Management International Case Competition and the attendees loved the cuisine! The best part is you may bring your own bottle (BYOB) and they provide the glasses and ice."}
{"text":"I second most of the other reviews- great, affordable food (especially the mussels au poivre with frites), comfortable modern atmosphere.  Service, like everywhere else in Montreal, can be iffy at times but I've never had any real issues.  There's a SAQ liquor store next door for BYO wine- saves a ton of $!  Great people watching in the summer when all the giant windows are open- I remember getting a third floor view of the jovial aftermath of a France World Cup win (crowds flooded the streets honking horns and waving flags so they had to block off St. Denis)."}
{"text":"We were a big party of 15 and were seated at two tables on the third floor on a Friday night. The decor is nice with rustic exposed brick walls and large windows overlooking a busy street. It's a very big restaurant with vibrant atmosphere. 

I was quite surprised with the restaurant's BYOB policy. A big plus. Our Montreal hosts brought very good wine. The bread and butter they serve at L'academie is amazing. 

I ordered mussels and fries Provençal and was very happy with my dinner. It was delicious. My husband had halibut and was not happy, the fish was dry and tasteless.

We shared a Creme Brulee, which was pretty good.

Overall, I would say this is a very good restaurant for large crowds with a decent choice of entrees."}
{"text":"L'academie is overrated. This establishment is popular because of its relatively reasonable prices and bring-your-own-wine option. However, the positives end there. The food is mediocre and uninspired. But above all, the service is poor. It seems that the servers have too many tables to attend to, and are harried and rushed as a result. Once, we asked the server for pepper flakes and she said \"they're right there,\" gesturing to a service table. So we were supposed to reach over and take them? We were stunned. The waitress was unfriendly throughout our meal besides being very brusque. Would never return."}
{"text":"My friends took me to L'academie last night for my birthday ! We all love L'academie the food is always delicious and the ambiance very pleasant plus its BYOW! Everything was fine until the so called manager of the place interacted with us in the rudest and most inappropriate way! We did mention to him that we had not appreciate the way he had talked to us but he did not even hint a pinch of remorse. Quite frankly  a fake apology would have done it for me but i guess he judged that we were not even worth that. So clearly i don't recommend this place. I will stick to the one on crescent!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. FETTUCCINI CON RUCOLA (wild mushrooms, arugula & goat cheese) was terrible which was sinful as those ingredients should have been a slam dunk. Pasta isn't fresh despite what their signs say, only SOME of the pastas they offer are fresh. In this case it was dried pasta purchased elsewhere that is served. ROQUEFORT mussels were fine, the sauce itself is just cheese and cream so clearly delicious.Saving grace is that it is BYOB but from where we sat we could see a small, more family style looking BYO just across the street. We'll probably end up there next time."}
{"text":"Great spot because prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly, it's big so you're likely to get a seat, you can people-watch like crazy (inside or outside through the big windows), and there are lots of food choices.  I had mussels and frites, a salad to start, and split a dessert with my daughter. The bill for the two of us came to just over $50.  

I wasn't familiar with the BYOB concept but found it refreshing when the waiter offered to wait if I wanted to run across the street to buy a bottle of wine.  Casual place, lots of energy, great for a group, but fun for two as well.  I saw a couple having a more romantic (quiet) meal at the back of the second floor in a corner table, so there's something for everyone.

A fun neighborhood, so definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Can you believe L'académie has an astounding 9 locations in Montreal and the surrounding area? That blows my mind. I've only ever been to the one on Crescent so this was a first trying their St. Denis location.

Went with the fam jam as I would never have picked this myself. Honestly, I didn't even realize we had stepped foot into L'académie until it was too late. At least it's BYOB so grab a bottle of wine from the SAQ across the street and enjoy the nice breeze coming through the sliding windows.

Front part of the menu is starters and pasta. At least the pastas are cheap here ($12.95) from Sunday to Wednesday evenings and lunch time everyday. Gotta get people in somehow right?

There's also mussels & fries, poutines and chicken. Mussels and fries are on special for $13.95. Table d'hôte if you want a starter (soup or salad) and drink (tea or coffee). Back part is broken into veal, land, sea and desserts. Lastly, a separate dessert menu in case their massive portions weren't enough for you.

- Deinhard - my uncle grabbed this from the SAQ and it was really delicious. Light, crisp white wine that didn't break the bank. That's a win in my books.
- Buns - obviously, these are just filler but went well with dipping in the soup.
- Leek and potato soup - the potato and leek soup came with the table d'hôte. Not bad actually.

- Lasagna pasticciata ($12.95)
- Tortellini rose ($12.95)
- Provencal mussels and fries ($13.95)
- Linguini con gambrel ($16.00 table d'hôte)
- Veal scallopini with wild mushrooms ($16.00 table d'hôte)

Let's just say this was my only dud during my trip of amazing eats in town. I'd only come here if you want to take advantage of the BYOB but why would you do that when there's so many other BYOB's in town with amazing food?"}
{"text":"Ended up here after Tasso's was closed(Sunday). Fantastic ambiance- three stories high with a great patio and open window concept. Bring your won wine and no corkage fee makes this a plus as wel (SAQ right across the street is very convinient.)l. The food was decent but the experience was great. Really romantic and the window view gives you a great setting. . Definitely worth going to if you're new to Montreal or just trying to do something different."}
{"text":"Good place. BYOB. Pricey food. Awesome atmosphere.

I think essentially it provided a great backdrop for the bachelorette dinner I attended, not so much for the food but for the zen and modern decorations. And also the bring your own wine thing... Helps with an SAQ next door. The experience was fun but mainly because of my group, not so much the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"Loved this place. It is in a great location, is family oriented yet classy, and has three floors of seating so getting a table is not an issue. It is fancy yet personable. They also feature a BYOB with no corking fee! Almost every table I passed had a bottle of wine and there is also a liquor store right next to the restaurant you can purchase wine from. I got the dijonaise mussels with fries and my fiancé got the penne romanoff. We both loved our meals the mussels were a very unique choice and some of the best mussels I've had. My fiancé loved her penne romanoff and said it was one of the best vodka sauces she'd ever had. Our waitress was very nice and personable. Although we do not speak French, she catered to everything we needed!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we gave this place a chance. Myself and three others were on our way to another restaurant down the street when walked past this place and decided to give it a try instead.
It's a huge place and we walked right in and were given a window table on the second floor overlooking St Denis.

On the night that we went a lobster special was on offer. $26 for a full lobster with sides. An amazing dish. I had the spaghetti carbonara which was delicious and completely satisfying. 

 Another great feature is bring-your-own-wine. (with no corking fee) Luckily there is an SAQ right across the street, and we grabbed a bottle and a few cold beers."}
{"text":"L'academie is well..... L'academie. You don't go there for the fantastic food (let's be honest, it's not all that great) or the service (it took our waitress 3 tries to get our bill right which in the end was still wrong). But you go there for the cheap dishes and BYOW."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Came here on a saturday night and there was a wait. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait long for our table as there was an upstairs seating area. We saw that everyone brought their own wine and figured it was BYOB. We grabbed a bottle of wine across the street at Saqs to complete the meal. Service was extremely slow but I think it's a general Montreal thing because everywhere we went, service was SLOW. Anyway, we ordered the rack of lamb and the mussels. The mussels were amazing and were devoured in seconds. The wine butter broth was delicious. The lamb was cooked perfectly (medium rare) but the raspberry sauce wasn't flavorful enough. The food was mediocre but nothing special. But the byob and mussels are enough reason to come back here."}
{"text":"I finally got around to eating at L'Académie this Friday. The restaurant gives off this air of Zen grandeur and European opulence at the same time while serving a fusion of Italian and French fusion cuisine. What it is really is a lot of pretentiousness and posturing, form over function, appeal over taste.

To begin with I couldn't believe the menu or more to the point how 30 years ago it was. What self-respecting fine dining institution with any sense of modernity still serves Coquille St-Jacques, Escargot with garlic butter and Parmesan Fondue as entrée? Really? In 2008? Tortellini Cardinal is not fine dining it's now been reduced to cafeteria food. All good plates when well prepared, but preparations that are passé and no longer original.

I started with the Insalata Italiana or Italian Salad.
Lovely greens, very fresh and some cherry tomatoes that tasted just awful and sticks of Parmesan Regiano with a nice Balsamic vinaigrette. Most restaurants drown their salads in vinaigrette, L'Académie seems to fear this very same thing by not putting enough dressing on the salad and the salad tasted dry.

Then as my Primo Piatto, or Plat de Resistance
I went for the Filet Mignon with a Port reduction. I'm just a sucker for steak. It was served with potatoes that had been fried whole and some veggies. The only thing that was remotely good was the Port reduction. Ok maybe the corn cob which tasted a bit funny because it was obviously not from Québec soil.

The Broccoli bouquet was undercooked and completely tastless. The carrot was also seriously undercooked. There's a difference between Al Dente and undercooked; a chef should know such a simple difference.

The Potatoes... how can a chef screw up a staple like potatoes? We all eat potatoes, we can expect better than fried whole potatoes that have absolutely no seasoning or taste, are dry and crunchy; just so wrong.

Last but no least on the hit list, the Filet Mignon. Now correct me if I'm wrong because I'm no steak expert but I eat enough steak in steakhouses and consider myself a bit of a connoisseur, but Filet Mignon shouldn't be marbled with fat and nerving right? Well I had to chainsaw this Filet Mignon and after three bites I was done.

That was it. Three bites of my steak and one half of a potato and I couldn't eat anymore. I was beyond disappointed. I knew I wasn't stepping into a high end restaurant, but it does hold up a promise of fine dining. This was ridiculous, flavourless and pretty much revolting.

Desert... there was no desert;
I couldn't take any more disappointment this evening. Why is it restaurants or chefs can't prepare simple things like a steak? This is Montreal, a world renowned steak town and this supposedly fine dinning restaurant can't prepare a decent steak? When I try out new restaurants I go for the simple items on the menu, because that's the true test of a chef. If I go to an Italian restaurant and I order the ever classic and simple Alfredo and I can taste that it comes from a starch filled envelope, when it's quite possibly the easiest sauce to prepare, I will never set foot in that restaurant again; as I will do with L'Académie.

A generous 1 outta 5."}
{"text":"This place is consistently wonderful. I want to give it 4.5 stars because the last time I went, we waited for a while to get a seat. Although a native, this place opened just before I left for LA so I didn't get a chance to eat here often but I do go whenever I am back in town. Anyone who knows Montreal knows that it is definitely a foodie town...Montreal palates have been spoiled so that many restaurants in other cities which may satisfy pedestrian tastes, do nothing for a more practiced tongue. This modern Italian restaurant (with French flourishes) uses the freshest ingredients and constantly modifies their menu as it is connected with a culinary institute...the students come here to practice how to run a real restaurant. I'm salivating just thinking about this place...hmm...time to book a ticket back home.

*Don't forget to bring your own wine or if you forget, there is an SAQ (government liquor store) right next door. They do not serve alcohol...i don't believe they are licensed for that."}
{"text":"The italien cuisine provided by this restaurant is quite good. I went there because of an activity of school. I ordered a pasta with tomatoes, spinach and shrimps. It tasted good."}
{"text":"This place on St-Denis can get pretty busy with tourists and older crowd visiting Montreal. I have been to this restaurant few times before with an older family member who loves it. The service is good but the food is just okay. Their pasta dishes seems to me better than the meat dishes, but that's just my opinion. It's a BYOB restaurant which I'm a fan of because you can bring your favorite wine or two. Overall, it's a good choice to bring your parents or an older aunt, they'll probably love it."}
{"text":"I made a recent trip to Montreal and tried L'academie with a group of McGill law students. The restaurant is three floors and very clean and spacious. The menu is alright, it's extensive and offers everything from veal to pasta to seafood. I ordered the grilled chicken with pink peppercorn cream sauce and it came with veggies and potatoes. Honestly, I didn't find the food to be great- the grilled chicken tasted like it was bought from the grocery store and the veggies didn't seem that fresh. The main selling point for this place is its BYOB policy, which is good because patrons can save money on drinks. A group of 5 finished 3 bottles of wine, hah. There are a lot of good restaurants in Montreal and since the food here is nothing to write home about, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant for mussels in 8 different styles. You can BYOB and enjoy sitting on the window corner deck."}
{"text":"I would've liked this place much more if they didn't force us to eat more food than we actually wanted.

Let me start by saying I appreciate the fact they're BYOB with NO corking fee (which is unusual in the good 'ol U S of A). There is an SAS right across the street, so you really don't need to be ordering a bottle off their menu. I also appreciate that it's massive: three floors all with huge windows facing Rue St-Denis. Bottom floor keeps the windows open when the weather is nice, while upper floors keep the windows shut (but I'm pretty sure they can open). Service was cut & dry. Sometimes it's refreshing to have a server spend as little time possible at the table so we can enjoy our drinks (although a check-back after the main dish came out would've been nice). 

The menu is nothing to brag about. There's a lot of options if you're a seafood or meat fan, but only one or two for vegetarians. We (initially) got the arugula parmesan salad to start and the pasta with tomato sauce / red peppers. The pasta was really tasty actually, and we definitely enjoyed it. The salad... was exactly what we expected. But then we were told we HAD to order either two main plates, or two appetizers and one main plate. I have *never* heard of a restaurant that requires their patrons to order a minimum amount of food (excluding table service at a fancy club or something). Just because we were two people means we have to eat more? What if we don't want to? What if one is watching their weight? What if one is allergic to nearly everything except one item on the menu? Do they not want more profit? Why would they [potentially] lose a customer because they aren't ordering more food than desired?

These are the real questions of the universe. Had we not already opened the bottle of wine when sitting down, we would've easily walked out of the place."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I used to go there everytime I had  friends visiting Montreal. This restaurant is loud and very busy, which is great for impressing them :).

The food is very good. I think it is relatively cheap for what you get."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday for a friend's birthday supper. She had made reservations 2-3 weeks in advance for a group of 25 for 9pm. She was given a long speech about having everyone there on time otherwise her reservation would be given away. All 25 of us showed up by 8:50, but the hostess refused to seat us and she made a big stink about us blocking the entrance way (which, mind you, is really small). So she shooed some of us outside, and was quite rude and hostile. The birthday girl requested to speak to the manager because this was just ridiculous; the manager didn't seem too bothered for being a hypocrite and had us wait until about 9:20 to be seated. Their justification was that she had made the reservation for 22 people, not 25 and it was so much harder to find an extra table to accommodate the extra guests. 

Finally being seated, our orders were only taken at about 9:50; we were given bread to munch on, but in contrary to other reviews, it was cold and a little stale. Our waiter and waitress were nice, which was probably the only reason why I'm giving this an extra star. I ordered the Italian salad and fried calamari as my entree. We only ended up being served at after 11, and unfortunately for one of our party members, he was only served going on 11:30 because of an apparent order mix-up; he was compensated with a free dessert only after having pressed the waitress for one. Prices are high for the quality of food; it wasn't terrible, but it doesn't stand out in my mind as amazing. For dessert, my boyfriend Danny and I shared creme brulée, which was pretty good, but again not OMG amazing. 

Not too long after finishing our meal and enjoying the rest of our alcohol, a manager (I'm assuming) came around, and without any tact or manners, said he was closing the doors in 5 minutes and we had to get out. Quite frankly, the experience left something to be desired. I will not be coming back here because they seem to lack the basics of customer service, and the food isn't anything to write home about."}
