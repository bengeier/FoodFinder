{"text":"DELICIOUS! The girl who took my order wasn't very pleasant. This is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. She had an attitude. Wouldn't look at me when she handed me my change and was just overall rude. The cooks were on point tho. I will go here again but not this location which SUCKS bc it's 2 minutes from my house..."}
{"text":"I ordered a carne asada burrito and it was garbage! The carne asada tasted bad, thin and hard, just bad quality. Roberto's is not that great but it's better than this place"}
{"text":"Awesome I only do the lunch special always, cause the deal is great, one time the rice was kind of nasty tasting, but I gave it another try. And ever since then I am In love. I still want to try other things but I love tacos, (no cilantro) I grew up in Mexico and these are great tacos"}
{"text":"Good place for Mexican food. And it's very affordable. Roberto's is shit next to this place. Their salsas are actually salsa, not water down crap lol try it and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Hands down, some of the most legit \"quick\" Mexican food around! We frequent this place, & have tried just about everything...nothing has disappointed! The tamales are absolutely amazing, clearly handmade & authentic! Burritos are delicious & huge! Rolled tacos are a regular order! And finish it all off with ice cold horchata! Definitely never disappointed here!"}
{"text":"If you want best bang for you money and good Mexican foods, go somewhere else. First time ordering carne asada fries here and was very disappointed. They gave me half of what other shops are giving in their orders and charged the same price as other places around town. Wouldn't come back here again"}
{"text":"I went there today with my boyfriend and had the worse experience ever . Not only am I now at the hospital in labor early but I never got to eat my Tacos nor did he. 22 dollars to waste .  The lady there (older lady with gray and black hair) claimed to be the owner argued with me me over wanting more hot sauce for our tacos ( mind you they have an open salsa bar ) but apparently they clean up early before they close at 1 am so they didn't have it available . She was wanting to charge me extra and only wanted to give us 3 sauces for 8 tacos ! Mind you we ordered two plates and each plate 4 tacos a plate .. So how in the world did she come up with three sauces for two plates totaling 8 tacos ??? And we ordered a quesadilla . After asking again to please get more she refused and said no and then she proceeded to say said well no because it costs me money to give you more  ( again they have available an open salsa bar ) .. Her whole attitude and rude comment cost me to ask for my money back and she refuses .. She doesn't even offer to give more sauces or apologizes  . ( which the majority of businesses will do their best to accommodate customer and make them happy) My boyfriend then steps in and she still refuses giving him the same attitude ( now I'm crying , pregnant hormones ) and my boyfriend manages to get the sauces after telling her how many tacos we ordered and how he is in the restaurant business and never would he allow such behavior at his restaurant ) and she rudely said this is the only time I'm doing this because it costs me money and it's extra ( again I'm stating they offer an open salsa bar , yet it costs her money) most places after customer is upset they comply or offer something to compensate the situation at hand ! How rude is that ! He leaves upset and I pack up our food while he waits in car mind you I'm crying my eyeballs out and this lady just looks at me with a nasty face and doesn't Even apologize or see if I am okay ( I was somewhat going into hyperventilation mode over all this drama) .. Regardless I leave and never did eat the tacos nor the quesadilla and now my water broke .. Probably over me getting upset with this evil lady . I will NEVER go back here for their horrible customer service ! That lady was rude and those other employees in the back didn't even try and help the situation . Worst customer service I have ever experienced ever !!!!! Honestly I am just upset over her rude attitude and her sense of reasoning behind the three sauces and not even being kind about it upset me , I'm all about customer service . I got so upset over her rude behavior It possibly cost me to go into labor between her being rude and then being super hungry and not being able to eat there because of her cold behavior . This is such horrible service I can't even tell u how horrible she was . Not once did she apologize or try to make it right and even when she did give the sauces she did it with the worst attitude .. It gave me the chills . I hope the real owners of this place fix this issue because it will cost them business not only that it gives them a bad name . Ppl like that shouldn't be in a customer service environment if they can't be amiable and helpful . I don't know what her problem was but handling the issue that way was wrong ."}
{"text":"Right down the street from me, luuucky! Huge selection and variety of items I have never ate before, like Huaraches. Bit more upscale casual grinds than Roberto's and the prices are a little higher, but well worth it. Keeping my take-out menu nearby!"}
{"text":"Great place and crave their food!  Tacos are my favorite food and their tacos and salsa have real Mexican flavor.  Prices are good and the place is much cleaner than most taco places in LV."}
{"text":"Came to this place after long trying to decide where to go eat. This place was across the restaurant that I initially was heading over to. Being not so busy decided to eat here. Not to shabby. Food is OK, no complaints. Family was ok...their food could be a tiny bit better quality."}
{"text":"Always good food! I heard about this place by my co-worker. She goes here a lot and I had to try it for my self. Now I come here often. Good menu! Authentic taste!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying this place since it opened....sadly I was not pleased. The lady at the cashier was so nice but that's about all I have to say for nice things. The tamale was small, and just eh tasting. Tacos were alright. The enchilada....was not an enchilada at all. No meat, flat, and almost like a quesadilla with enchilada sauce on it. Honestly, Frank and Phina's Caucina and Roberto's has bigger, real portions and prices are good!"}
{"text":"This place rules. I'm guilty of settling for Taco Bell for lunch before, but one time the line for the drive thru was nuts while the one for Tacos La Mexicana, which is right across the way,  was barren. I decided to stop betraying my heritage and give their drive thru a try, even though I knew it would take a little longer considering I was buying real food. The wait wasn't too much longer though: I got my food in minutes, it beat the crap out of Taco Bell, and I've been going here ever since. I loved everything I've had so far, the people are always nice and very accomodating, and the cost won't kill your wallet."}
{"text":"I came across this taco shop on Yelp and went because it was rated 4 out of 5 stars and was the closest taco shop to my new house. Didn't read up much on the reviews first, just trusted the star rating and knew I was going to eventually end up trying it sooner than later just to find out since it was so close to my casa.  I should start by saying I'm from San Diego where taco shops are galore and we are super spoiled apparently.   I would honestly give this taco shop a one if it wasn't for the great customer service. The girl at the front was very nice and helpful. The food on the other hand was a big letdown :( We ordered a carne asada burrito, child verde burrito, some fries, 3 rolled tacos and some churros.   -Never in my life have I seen a carne asada burrito that came with rice and beans. It was so weird. No guacamole, literally carne asada, beans, rice, onions and cilantro. It was the tiniest $6 burrito I've ever seen.  -Chile Verde burrito was carnitas meat, no sign of chile verde and again rice, beans, onions and cilantro. A bit bigger than the carne, but still not  great for he price your paying. Tasted bland. -Rolled tacos definitely looked decent but it was he tiniest 3 rolled tacos I've ever seen. They were mini rolled tacos for sure. My son liked them enough, but kept saying they were spicy( he can handle some spice for sure) ? -Fries were fries, small portion in a big box, but pretty hard to mess up. Grease was obviously old. Fries were darker then they should be. Nothing special. -The cajeta churros- great. The one thing in our order we were actually happy with. If I ever went back from some odd reason, probably the only thing I would order again.  Btw- every burrito comes with beans and rice. They charge extra for more salsa $1 for two (crazy), combos are around $9, but upside- the place was clean and the girl at the front was nice."}
{"text":"I've been to there other location and there food is good I decided to go to this one since it's closer to me and there Carne Asada fries are 10000000 times better than robertos the ones they put like a guacamole sauce one it wich isn't spicy and has an amazing flavor definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Looking for a reasonably priced, fast and exceptional Mexican spot? This place is it! Roberto's has nothing on this place. Cleanliness and appearance alone beats them. Friendly workers and it also has a drive thru for the lazy pajama cravings;) Definitely my new spot for super burritos!"}
{"text":"DO NOT call in your order!  They'll add in things you didn't order and charge you!  When I called back to question them, they didn't even offer a refund!  I'm SOOOOOOOO tired of businesses that don't care about customer service ... and this is defintely one of them!  STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"This is a very good Mexican eatery, not fancy, but really tasty and authentic. This is one of my go to taco stands on the west side."}
{"text":"Great Mexican Restaurant. Prices are Great!!! Love the Mesh Special and the owners are very nice. 5 star review"}
{"text":"i love this place. I usually do to taco el gordo for lengua tacos but i found this little gem. I love their lengua tacos & nachos it delicious. And i would rather go here then to Robert's even though it a little far for me."}
{"text":"The people there are so friendly. They were talking to us like we were regulars. And plus the food is authentic Mexican cuisine. I enjoyed the fact that they are open later than most places."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best nachos ever!it was so good and I loved coming here pregnant. It definitely hit the spot. A cool thing about the employees, the had a drifter come in and they fed him and let him come out of the cold. I asked if he would come sit with us and we talked and laughed. This place was great. The employees are a blessing so please go there and eat and bless them."}
{"text":"This used to be the best mexican food in town. Roberto sold the place and the quality and service has taken a nose dive. Don't bother anymore. They get orders wrong and then practically force you into taking what they've made anyway. I'm so bummed Roberto isn't there anymore. Especially since this place is about 3 minutes from my house."}
{"text":"Al pastor tacos were delicious! We also had the rolled chicken tacos - very fresh flavor. The rice In the combo plate was really flavorful - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely on of my favorite Places to get Mexican food in Las Vegas. I get a California burrito with chicken and potatoes... It's amazing and I crave it all the time! Even though I live in green valley I drive down here just for some La Mexicana!"}
{"text":"Went here again, and the food was still good in respect to taste, portion, and seasoning. Ordered a supreme burrito.  What changed that I disliked was that the sauces and jalepenos weren't readily available on that one middle table against the wall, and when I asked for jalepenos, they took it out of the freezer in the back of the kitchen and handed it to me directly.  The big deal about the jalepenos is that they are less spicy this way. In fact, boiling them makes them spicier. This might not be as big to other people, but when I order spicy food, especially if it's Mexican food, I expect a lot of spiciness."}
{"text":"Wow, so I came here for the first time with my boyfriend and it was the worst customer service I've had. We came up to the counter and we already knew what we wanted my guy started of by ordering but the lady taking the orders was super rude and impatient she kept raising her voice when asking what type of meat he wanted on his food. I cut that lady off and just walked out before I said something rude. So disrespectful I wasn't gonna let her have my money if she didn't want to serve us. I'd fire her honestly. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"love it! delicious!!!!!!!  if you are looking for excellent mexican food, this is the place to come..."}
{"text":"In my opinion, La Mexicana is the BEST mom and pop style mexican joint in town. I stumbled upon this place by accident years ago. I dont come as much as I should, but if im near by, I WILL stop in. Tacos are good and chimichanga is best in town. Every other item ive had is fantastic. Carne Asada plate is also good.   Unfortunately, this place had a major renovation a year or two ago. They repainted the walls, and took down all these cool things off the wall. Rumor has it that ownership changed? Since they did that, i feel like food has gone down from what it was, but food is still the best in town. This place was the best mexican food ive ever had 2007-2011ish. Since, not as good but worth the visit."}
{"text":"Overly Priced! Roach coach food at restaurant prices!  Chorizo burrito and a cheese quesadilla... $11  Faustos or Don tor taco are better and cheaper!  Use to be good but something changed.."}
{"text":"Really tasty Mexican... Love the chorizo breakfast burrito and 4 taco lunch special with rice and beans. I like carnitas, cabeza, and carne asada."}
{"text":"If you are looking for awesome, affordable, authentic Mexican food, you've come to the right place! Always fresh food, friendly staff, good central location. It's not a sit down restaurant, but the food is well worth the eating on plastics."}
{"text":"I went to this location today and order chilaquiles verdes. Overpriced. The chilaquiles were too watery, no onions, the rice tasted not fresh I do not recommend this place to anyone at all.  Hoy fui a esta locacion y ordene chilaquiles verdes. Cara la orden, los chilaquiles nadaban en agua y no traian cebolla, el sabor insipido y el arroz sabia como recalendado de otro dia, solo los frijoles sabian aceptables.   Le comente a la chica que tambien pregunte si los va a querer uno con pollo o sin pollo y no nomas los sirvan con pollo para cobrar mas. Yo no como pollo pero aun asi los pague y toda la tarde me he sentido mal del estomago.  I would have not care for the price if the taste would have been better. No me hubiera importado pagar mas pero que el sabor hubiera sido mas autentico.  Es calidad y servico lo que cuenta para que un cliente sigua regresando.  It is quality and service what counts for a customer to keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Their carnitas tacos are wonderful. I've tried many items on the menu and the only disappointment was the huevos rancheros. The chiliquilles are so good and you cannot beat the lunch special. Love it here. Families, friendly staff and great food. Prices so reasonable. You'll love it. Not high on ambience but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Authentic Mexican food for sure. Plus, I love that they have a drive-thru at the Durango location. My husband loves the Alambres and I usually order their tortas or tacos. They are pretty consistent with their food and service."}
{"text":"I really hate leaving a negative review, especially since the food arrived warm, but just had two breakfast burritos delivered and had to throw one away. There is nothing worse than biting into something that includes a half cup full of cilantro.l which I can't eat in large doses. No where in the description does it say cilantro. It does say pico de gallo which I realize has cilantro in it and I can handle it in those low dosages but this was full on smack filled with the horrible stuff. If the description stated it I would have known to ask for it left off. Almost impossible picking the crud out since there was so much of it. Easier to throw it away. I know this review is highly subjective because many people love cilantro. Unfortunately I'm not one of them and rely on the literal descriptions of the food before making an order. Can't say I'd order from here again."}
{"text":"I really don't get the negative reviews, this place is outstanding. Very reasonable prices and everything I have ever ordered has been excellent. To be honest there are lots of decent taco places in the area but I would rate this one slightly higher than the others. My wife loves going here also.  As for best dishes, anything involving their pastor is amazing."}
{"text":"The wait is long, but the food is good. This place has become an alternative to Robertos for me. Food is fresher and very warm and friendly service. I always order the Chorizo Sopes. Very good for drive thru Mexican and not too greasy."}
{"text":"We went to Desert Breeze Park, afterwards we were hungry so we walked across the street and saw  \"Tacos La Mexicana\", it's very clean, great ambiance, extensive menu, very reasonably priced! I ordered the Chile Relleno burrito, my wife got the Carne Asada Quesadilla, my daughter the beef and bean burrito. My Chile Relleno burrito was to die for, the flavor was off the charts, the pepper perfect, the cheese inside the pepper plentiful and melted to perfection, the rice, beans, and shredded beef were perfectly balanced as to not over power the Relleno pepper. My wife loves Quesadillas, she swore it was the best one she ever had! My daughter is a finicky, picky eater, she ate the whole burrito....woofed it down! Tacos La Mexicana will now be in our top five list of eateries that we frequent on a weekly basis. The service was four star as well. Thank you guys we LOVE your eatery!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! The food was fresh and made to order!!The customer service is great love the cook and the cashier!!! Hands down five  The family and I agreed this is the spot"}
{"text":"Yes. Delicious. I had street tacos and a tamale with chips and salsa. They have a salsa bar so you can eat as much as you want.  The tacos were delicious and the tamale was one of the best I have had. This is authentic Mexican food, and I recommend it to anyone. The staff was very courteous. I will eat here again!"}
{"text":"It's all about the meats and here they cook it and season it just right, not to mention the salsa bar is fantastic. It's not only spicy but it's a flavorful spicy. Anyway the food is made to order and the prices are great. As long as they keep up the freshness this place is a legit option for authentic Mexican food. Thumbs up. The cabeza and chicharron rocks too."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It is small inside. I ordered for take out. The prices are fair. I ordered the chile rellano plate, 3 tamales, an order of chips and beans. The chile rellano was delicious. Huge portion, could only eat half. My husband enjoyed the pork tamales. My favorite was the chips. Honestly the best chips I have had in Las Vegas. They were hot, crispy and perfectly seasoned.  The service was great.  I will come back to try more of the good food."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and was a total let down. The asada meat in our tacos and burritos was mostly just pieces of fat so I ended up picking out most of it. My husband and I both felt sick after eating. The only plus was I did receive good service."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican Restaurant I've been to in my life. Everything that was served to me was microwaved. This place should be casted onto \"Kitchen Nightmare\"for how bad their food is."}
{"text":"I ordered asada tacos and asada burrito. EVery bite I took I bit into grisel. It was horrible. Was hard to believe I was even east beef. More like human or a rat or something. Food was tasteless and I drove 25 miles for no reason.. disguting I will never go back,"}
{"text":"Delicious! I could these tacos everyday. I've been coming here for years and the food is always great. Fresh food, friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant to eat at if your craving good Mexican food the atmosphere is really good they have alot of pictures of classic boxing fights from recent years I thought that was cool. Anyhow the customer service is good the prices are pretty reasonable and the food is delicious I got an order of fries two Carne asada burritos and it was delicious and they filled me up these burritos weren't your small type of burritos that you get at taco bell or any other place like that they were huge filled with alot of meat and cheese and will fill you up overall I really like this place and I see myself coming back here again maybe trying something else off of the menu."}
{"text":"I just left this place today 12/19/15 with the worst experience ever at this restaurant. First off I've been coming for the last three years and it was one of the best and my favorites. But as I continue to to come I become more and more dissatisfied and today topped it off. Lately the cleanliness of this place has been going down the drain, dirty kitchen floors salsa bar is not up to healthy standards anymore etc. One of my favorite dishes was the menudo, it used to be the best in town even better than the one at the lindo and bonito michoacan and more authentic also. But today when I bough my usual large size order that usually costs about 8 bucks. I noticed that they dis not put enough meat, there is a reason why I order a large portion, so I took it back, and I was served a new one. Well I don't know if it had been sitting for a long time but it tasted liked old wet rag!!! Keep in mind that I always ask if they still have menudo left as it is popular dish a and has to be eaten within a certain time. The cashier today said they did have menudo, well she forgot to mention hat it was more ready to be tossed out. To all the Poole I've recommended this place to, do not eat here, quality and cleanliness is no longer served at Tacos La Mexicana!"}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in my life and expensive to boot! Brought our carne asada tacos home and there were little chunks of bone in almost all of them!!! The chicken rolled tacos were undercooked and soggy. The chicken enchiladas were blah. I have no idea how this place has 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Pros: drive thru, inexpensive, quick, food is good for what you pay for, Coke products, and friendly people.   I really wanted elotes. This was close to my house and was thrilled when I saw a drive thru and didn't have to haul my baby in with me. The corn was $3, not the best I ever had, but really good!   I recommend it. :)"}
{"text":"Solid family-run Mexican joint- props for the diverse menu (check out the new additions section) and the drive-thru. Service was also polite, and there are both hot and mild versions of red and green salsa available.  Hard shell chicken tacos are  a touch overpriced at $2.25, considering they don't have much in them but they're generous with the cheese. Happy to see the California burrito on their menu, served with carne asada, as it should be- hefty size, not much in the way of fries/potatoes but good overall flavor.  They have a special section of the menu for skillet-type meals that feed two for a good price, and come with a stack of tortillas. Several tortas on the menu, including a mega and a pambazo."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time.  This is my favorite taco shop in Vegas. The inside is small and cozy but it's worth it for the food. The prices are ok. I like the tacos the most but the carne asada fries are excellent and the portion size it two meals worth of food."}
{"text":"Wow!  I ordered in and had it delivered, I am amazed at how good the food was.  We love Mexican food and have tried every place in town.  From now on, we're going here.  My daughter ordered a bean and cheese burrito and loved it.  I know, boring right!?  We also ordered the asada chimichanga, chicken rolled tacos, tamales and a churro.  All was excellent.  I wish I would have taken photos.  Also, their sauces are amazing!  100% satisfied."}
{"text":"Good service i like the food very similar to the real mexican food, im happy to find this place because the tacos are good whenyou are looking for a tacos"}
{"text":"Got their chicken tacos combo. Amazing and the price is great! Their chicken is cooked too perfection. Found my new go to taco spot! Thanks:)"}
{"text":"Decently priced Mexican food. The carnitas torta is amazing!  Kinda far from my house though. Tried the torta at Roberto's and it's just not the same...at all. Oh well, the drive is worth it!"}
{"text":"Worst mexican food that I've ever tasted.  The guacamole was runy like baby food and the quesadilla was greasy and nasty.  When I went back to return it, the girl look dumfounded and said \"this is a quesidilla its what you ordered.\"  She didn't ask if she could make it right and get me something else or asked me if I would like a refund.  Do not go here for the cheap knock off mexican food... Taco bell is even more mexican than them, and thats sad!"}
{"text":"Just got here from San Diego and was looking for a good taco shop like back home. We stumbled upon this one because it has a drive thru and they are pleasantly quick with preparing your food. We are happy with the presentation and the portions. We scarfed down the rolled tacos that are pretty large and very crunchy  but here is the pic of the enchilada combo ps their horchata is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Food was so so. I wanted to try them vs Roberto's but the food wasn't seasoned well and i didn't much care for the chicken rolled tacos. The carna asada taco was ok. Im from cali so i know good Mexican food and this isn't it."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time today, ordered 6 tacos strictly said NO onions multiple times (allergic) but wanted cilantro & they put onions on it. They let me go back and get new set of tacos, only to find out that there was just meat with no cilantro this time after I repeated my order TWICE and came back there twice. How can you get the order mixed up after messing up the first time. I called to tell them the problem and all the lady said \"I don't know what to tell you, you can come back again if you want. Sorry\" with an attitude, so I just hung up. Horrible."}
{"text":"Just ordered food delivered from here. I've never been in or ordered before. Dinner for 3 and 2 kids. Everyone is very happy. Best mex I've had in the last year. Spices are on point. Everything tastes fresh. You can tell someone really put thought into thrier recipies. Unlike some of the local competition, this is definately not the cheapest ingrediants you can find, throw in a box, dump sauce on it and call it mexican food. I'm impressed, and I'm not easy to impress! I'll be hard pressed to try a different  Mexican restuarant at this point. Yum!"}
{"text":"For a taco shop, this seems about an authentic as it gets.  The quality of the ingredients seems to be a step up from your standard *bertos fare.  I have had both the chorizo breakfast burrito and the carne asada burrito and they were both fantastic.  I look forward to trying the more unique items on the menu.  On top of great food, you can expect service with a smile and self-serve hot carrots and peppers while you wait.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Cold, pre frozen food fried..then served room temp. Last 2 visits then cashier got the order wrong with the take out. Dining room was in complete disarray and filthy.  The health department should visit places like this on a regular basis, otherwise they would be closed for business. Skip this place and go to macayos..much better quality food, service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"So there food is really good.... I wish I can go back and order from them but I can't since I can't stop thinking about the hair I've seen in my food TWICE. If you don't mind hair in your food than go for it!!"}
{"text":"Quite dissapointed their burrito was understuffed and other items seemed smaller than normal, the salsa was watered down and lacked and flavor, and prices originally shown on a posted menu have gone way up. The food itself was ok but overall felt very unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I don't usually review joints like these, but I had to. You would think that when you walk into this place it would be similar to Roberto's or other small Mexican joints, but it's different in it's own ways. I usually go with the rolled tacos or the hard tacos. One thing I noticed is that the shredded chicken has more flavor to it compared to other places. Also, it's never dry and never drenched in oil. Their sauces are all very flavorful. There is a hot side and mild side on the sauce cart. I always go with the hot green sauce. It's my favorite. I can also appreciate that this place has a drive thru because I definitely have my days where I'm lazy, hungry and don't want to get out of my car. It's located right next to cj's frozen custard which is also awesome lol."}
{"text":"I'm picky about fast food Mexican place. I tried this place for a second time today and just like my first time it did NOT disappoint me! This is all homemade type dishes. The service is amaaaazing and they just gained a frequent customer."}
{"text":"We got tacos de pastores, California burrito and burritos!  It's delicious and the meats r tender.  The place is clean and the workers are friendly.   I would def come back here."}
{"text":"Real happy with this place... In fact, it may be my go-to spot for quick Mexican fare in this area. I like the quality, portion sizes and prices. I also like the variety which beats your typical enchiladas, tacos and burritos. We tried the gringa which was quite tasty and the carne asado nachos which went over very well. I wasn't crazy about the California burrito which came highly recommended, but it may be your cup of tea. I'm a fan of more meat, less other stuff in my burritos of course..."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I stopped here for some late night munchies after partying on Halloween night. This place is about 2 miles from the house, and I have seen it before but never stopped in. They have a drive-thru, which I pulled into. Be careful, it is a bit narrow and you have to turn to get into it. Then when you exit, you go downhill so go slow.  We ordered a carne asada burrito, 2 asada sopes, and 2 al pastor tacos. The sopes are large, not the small ones I am used to from other places. To give you an idea, each one needed it's own styrofoam clamshell container. They come with lettuce, tomato and cheese on top of your choice of meat. The asada was gristly. I was slightly annoyed that I had to pick out the fatty meat chunks from my food. The al pastor was delicious though. We got the tacos sans onions and cilantro, so we really got to taste the flavor of the delicious pastor. They did not skimp on the meat either, each taco was literally stuffed to the max. They also provided some delicious house made salsa that was not too mild, not too spicy, but justttt right. I noticed they have elotes so I will for sure be back to try these."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the customer service was amazing! I went through the drive-thru and they got my order wrong. I went in expecting a reluctant employee to remake my burrito. Instead, I encountered an employee who was extremely apologetic and very eager to remake my order and get it right. Any place with customer service as good and pleasant as this deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years even when there was a previous owner.. and the food has always been great! It's hard to find a traditional Mexican yummy spot! But this place always hits the spot! Best flour tortillas too!"}
{"text":"Wow. How lucky it is that I've found this place. I hate to cook so I always eat out, and by always, I mean two meals a day. I've been going around different restaurants for months that fit my budget and I would pay around $10 ~ $15 for a decent meal at a decent restaurant. Then I came here. I ordered a lunch special for $6.43. I expected a paltry amount but no, I was quite full and the food was delicious! And the food wasn't watered-down Americanized food; it was genuine Mexican food. Since then, I've been coming here EVERYDAY (literally). I don't know how they are able run their business, serving such high quality food while charging so little. I almost fear that they might go out of business. I feel obligated to leave this five-star review because I want them to have a lot of customers. I absolutely love the place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had the urge for tacos but wanted too try something different then my normal spot. So thought too myself is there better time too check out Tacos La Mexicana! I remember back when it use too be japanese restaurant and always been curious too check it out. I heard lot of positive reviews for it. My first impression walked in was floor space itself nothing changed and there still bamboo plants that use for decoration. Really that when the similarity ends. Inside they changed the color, added big sombrero on the wall, the menu has a nice diversity (but not too big), and drinks have your horchata, mexican soda (love that old school soda in glass bottle) and old school coke glass bottle. Small place laid back atmosphere plus if on the go they even have drive thru window.  I always been fan of authentic tacos none of this american fast food tacos. Between taco trucks and authentic places like Tacos La Mexicana nice option. Lengua guy through and through. No exception got two lengua and two carne asadas tacos. I had too get some refried beans just cause. It like having peanuts and beer. One compliments the other. Both tacos were awesome! I like the portion size of meat they give you per tacos. Both cooked perfect, nice moist, hot, tasty, and hit it with one of five different salsas. Delicious! I almost got in all five. The salsa verde, salsa roja, and regular salsa. You can tell they were freshly made each day. Although the way they ice it down had its own personality. I think the fact that they have FIVE different salsa all daily fresh made, along with your pickled jalapenos/carrots. By far best salsa bar or station had in town yet! The refried beans were pretty tasty too. I just came Big fab of Tacos La Mexicana.  The lunch specials talk about STEAL of deal. Four tacos any choice PLUS you get rice and beans plus drink. It not that much more for dinner but ordering tacos at dinner that all you get. So lunch better bargain but still lunch of dinner great value great food. Plus five different salsas not as though same tacos every time. I know Tacos La Mexicana is place that plan on stopping by more often."}
{"text":"Decent tacos and super cheap too, especially if you come during lunch (before 3 pm) for their lunch special where you get 4 tacos, rice, beans and drink for $5.99. If you come after 3 pm, you pay the same price and just don't get a drink. They also have several other specials on the menu and the same policy applies.   The chorizo is my favorite so far. The tacos seemed smaller than other places but the meats are tasty although sometimes slightly greasy. The horchata tasted watered down so just opt for a soda."}
{"text":"So yummy!  One of my favorite places to get delicious street tacos!!  Service takes a while, but it's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"This used to be a five star restaurant but since Robert sold it, I've found it's not as good. My in laws used to bring food from here and it was top notch a couple years ago.   Went two days ago and the food was really lacking flavor. The asada taco was very bland and didn't seem grilled. Super disappointed. Then again considering how cheap this is you can't complain much.  We walked out with two orders of rolled tacos, the asada tacos, a quesadilla, two ice creams and it came to only 17. Crazy. I don't know how they make a profit at that price.   The quesadilla was huge and my toddler couldn't finish it.   The rolled tacos were very crisp, but the guac sauce on top was bland.   Service was quick and friendly. We chatted t up a bit. Maybe it was an off day so we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is going to be our new go to spot for mexican food. Its a brand new hidden treasure two blocks away from our house.  Roberto's is crap food and very expensive. They nickle and dime you so I really wanted to find a new mexican place that taste authentic. especially since our favorite restaurant chappala's closed last year.  Walking in the place was packed, no where to sit.. which in my eyes is a very good sign. there arent a lot of places to sit, maybe 5 tables but every chair was taken and people were chowing down.  Once we started looking at the menu a gentlemen walked out from behind the counter and handed us a menu. He mentioned we could always call ahead and then go through their drive thru for pick up. Wait, drive thru!? Thats a star in itself because theres somedays I just want my mexican food but dont want to get out of my pjs or put any makeup on.   I noticed they are significantly lower than other places around here which is great. Here are the prices of some of the items we ordered. 4 rolled tacos (chicken) combinations plate (included guac, lettuce, sour cream and cheese) 6.95. Chicken hard tacos (fully loaded!! and huge! Completely worth it) 1.99. Small horchata 1.50. Pork tamale 1.99 Cheese quesadilla (made with the mexican cheese and super huge!) Asada burrito (beans, rice, cheese, onions, and meat) 4.99.  All of the above were delicious. I think the tamale could have had a bit more flavor but   I may just be spoiled from having cook them myself all the time.  Everything was in great portion. We have leftovers actually. Half the quesadilla, two chicken tacos and two rolled tacos, rice and beans. It came to 17 but next time im sure we will spend less.. our eyes were bigger than our stomach.    The customer service was great and everyone was friendly and welcoming. they had no problem explaining what was in every burrito or mentioning what their biggest items sold are.  They had a salsa bar with lots of items and their salsa was delicious and fresh.  I really liked that they didnt charge to use our debit card, like robertos does.  would have taken more pictures of the food, but we inhaled it but i take that as a positive note :)"}
{"text":"Lunch special isn't so \"special\" no mo'. It's $7.49, and the tacos are smaller than I remember. The tortillas were much greasier than I remember. Also, the proteins are grislier/fattier and more burnt than I remember. The salsas are still homemade and chilled, but they don't pack as much flavor or heat as I remember. (This is beginning to sound like a sad school reunion.)  The beans on my tostada ($2.75) were lukewarm at best. I ate them anyway.  Every bite of anything you eat here is just better at Taco Y Taco on the other side of town.  I will not be eating at Tacos La Mexicana no mo'.   Surprisingly, this place was full of customers."}
{"text":"The lunch special love is gone. It's now $7.49 and greasier than you remember. I choose to bring my taco binges to Taco Y Taco. For now."}
{"text":"Everything about them is excellent, friendly service,good lunch specials,beans&chips, way better compared to all these other little restaurants. also have a really good salsa bar too and drive thru open till 1am!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. I have had better. I ordered 2 asada tacos and 2 al pastor. Both kind of lacking in flavor. The tortillas were good and great customer service ."}
{"text":"Love it! It's great to grab a bite for lunch. Love all the different salsas! Prices are reasonable -  TV is too loud most of the time, but I can overlook that I guess.  Just is hard to even have a conversation at the table. All in all - Great place!!!! I think I'll go there for lunch today!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! I got a delicious combination plate. Everything was amazing so good, don't be afraid to try this place if you're not into spicy food, nothing was spicy if you want to add hot sauce you can I guess but this was delicious and perfect!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst chile relleno ever. You can tell it was microwaved because of how soggy and greasy."}
{"text":"Coming from Calfornia this is the Best Mexican food restaurant that we found out here in las vegas so far! The food was fast, home made and tasted great! We will definitely  be coming back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great food and great employees, they always have a smile on there face and I've never had any problems with there food!! I highly recommend the el pastore tacos"}
{"text":"I love the carne asada huaraches they are the best!!! It's a gigantic tortilla filled with black beans topped with meat,cheese, onion  and salsa verde. They take a long time But its worth it. The service is always good."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the original Tacos La Mexicana on Decatur and Twain for some time. So, I'm thrilled that they brought all that taco goodness closer to my neck of the woods with their second location near Durango and Spring Mountain. The carnitas tacos are just as good as the ones at the original spot. The quality and flavor of the asada are better than almost any taco shop on the west side of town and the al pastor wasn't bad either. Tacos are pretty cheap at $1.39 each. The chicken tamale ($1.75) was pretty good, but the carnitas is what you should load up on."}
{"text":"The whole time I waited for this food I was looking at Taco Bell and was like should have gone with what you know. The amount of American cheese used is gross, also, American cheese for Mexican food, that is so gross, my quesadilla was greasy and soggy, my burrito was sub par. It was a breakfast burrito, and the amount of plastic cheese made we toss it half way. This was an underwhelming experience and would not recommend to anyone I like talking too. Service was cold. I'm sorry I'm inconveniencing you by paying you money. Maybe you should choose a different career path"}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles.  Great tasting tacos! Great service.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Hubby was starving so we wanted something quick. Planned on Roberto's but decided to try this place after reading some of the reviews. We got Nachos and they were very good.. their chips are perfect and the toppings/sauces were very fresh. The service was also very good. The girl who took our order and gave us our food was SO sweet. Next time we'll get the Chicken Nachos or maybe ask for combo meat.  4 stars because service and food were both very good, especially for it just being a drive thru."}
{"text":"I've finally found a legit Mexican restaurant in Vegas plus it's fast food & has a drive-thru window! Food is delish! I always order the carne asada taco combo lunch special, even during nonlunch hours. They make the exception & always provide speedy service. Great prices & food! Wayyyyy better than Roberto's."}
{"text":"My family and I came here last week while we were in Vegas because we were looking for some authentic Mexican food like we have here. We drove by this place and decided to give it a try. For a family of 6, this was a great deal! We tried a little of everything and my teenagers plowed through their assortment of tortas, tripas and lengua tacos, and taquitos. The kids even went back for more, which was fine with us because the prices were very reasonable and the food was great. Add in a friendly staff and super quick service with our experience, which is why I would highly recommend this place if you need some great food away from the chaos of the strip."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty chicken nachos!  Beats Roberto's by a landslide.  Glad I found this quick lil yummy Mexican place nearby.  Thanks fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"Note: I'm an east coaster. I'm no taco pro. But these guys are awesome and the $5.99 lunch special is rad. 4 'cos (carnitas, pastor, pollo, chorizo), rice, beans, soda, bawse. The rice is bleh (but who needs it) and the pollo taco is bleh (isn't every?), but every other 'co was legit. 3-4 bites each in corn tortillas, they were sized perfectly.  The salsa's are solid, too. Reading previous reviews, I knew to ask for them at the window but didn't expect four different kinds to be tossed in the bag. Each different in consistency and spice level, it was fun to mix and match.   This place crushes Roberto's (minus the breakfast burrito) and I can't wait to get back here (tomorrow). Bonus: it's right next to a taco bell (sorry TBell)."}
{"text":"I prefer this location over the one on Decatur although service and food is phenomenal at both. This place is a little hole in the wall kind of joint. They have a massive menu and it's so cheap and the portions are huge. They have the best Carne Asada fries ever. They are perfection. The chimichangas here are top notch. I love the California burrito. I usually take my orders to go but I have eaten at both locations and both are clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Best carnitas torta I've ever had in my life! It was a game changer. Fo real. The elote was so fresh, too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Use to live right down the street from this place and always have lunch . Sad that I moved far away but still would love to come back and eat they're amazing quesadilla with steak which you will not be able to finish it is way too big but the tortillas taste handmade and soft and they have a really good green salsa here you have to try! Would recommend this places HOrchata!"}
{"text":"Great service and fast you get that these days. The drive thru is quick and they have a nice light menu so you won't be struggling on reading the menu. The employees are very nice and they know menu really good. I will be back when ever I want authentic Mexican food"}
{"text":"We live about a half mile away. One day I bought the fish tacos and enjoyed them. Today ran over for lunch: the shrimp cocktail was big and tasty. Asado fries are full of tasty meat, good fries and jalapenos. I filled up on the fries and the fish tacos again. My tough reviewer husband wants to go back- this enough is a great comment!! Sweet staff, clean atmosphere, quick real food- we are so lucky to have such great hidden secrets near home!!"}
{"text":"Been looking for good mexican food in vegas and i think i found the spot! They have great customer service. Got their California burrito with AL pastor and pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Don't let the 4 versus 5 stars fool you, the food here is delicious, and everyone is warm and friendly, even to a very pale American girl who never had real Mexican food until she moved to Las Vegas  I judge Mexican food by the Carnitas, something I had for the first time about 4 years ago.  The carnitas here is delicious, but occasionally a bit too greasy.The carne asada has good flavor, also, and I enjoyed the pork tamale, huarache, and the rolled tacos.  The green salsa is absolutely too die for delicious.  I stop in once a week or more, and get treated like a welcome friend every time, and that keeps me coming back even more.  If you haven't tried it yet, stop in for lunch and try one of the lunch specials. You can even go through the drive-thru and take it with you!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for lunch, it was delicious. All five in my party enjoyed our meals. I got the 4 taco special plus horchata and loved it. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"If you ever wanted to know what a $4 bean & cheese burrito looked like... it's super small and extremely overpriced. Yelp listed it at $2.99, sadly I was wrong. Very disappointed. I could've went to Taco Bell and been just as satisfied."}
{"text":"I love this place I go once a week best tacos Carnitas in town and the salsa bar is awesome 5 or more types !"}
{"text":"Their lunch special is awesome,4 tacos plus rice, beans and a drink for $6. You can't beat it. They also offer other lunch specials, and I plan on trying them all. It's like a Robertos, almost. Loved it."}
{"text":"Their tacos are good but their carne Asada fries, to me, are exceptional. It was doused in jalapeños and I was not aware that was going to be on my food. Will I come back here? Maybe, maybe not.   Their drive thru is an inconvenience because it's so narrow, but the staff seemed friendly!"}
{"text":"Drive thru is very narrow and I drive a small car, cannot imagine what it would be like in a truck or suv. I ordered a carne asada burrito which was good and nice sized. Line was long for only one car in front of me but the food was very fresh and worth the wait. Reasonably priced. Authentic. I would come back, the woman was nice and helpful and patience as my friend and I had two seperate orders in the same car."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK in my book as far as mexican food goes here in Las Vegas.  It's located in a strip mall that is a little bit sketch and you have to politely wave away the Viejo in a cowboy hat who is selling oranges.  And for that Ilittle known fact I bumped up the authenticity!   The tacos are so cute and tiny.  Make sure you order at least 3! They have a great combo w/ rice and beans and I suggest you order the pastor, carnitas and asada tacos.  I am always looking for some bomb enchiladas and so I thought I'd try here.   These were not what I was expecting but they were tasty.  I thought the sauce was too tangy and tasted like the candy plum chili sauce we ate as kids called chamoy. Try the Jamica drink.  Its always my favorite thing to try when I frequent my Mexican eateries. The price is super affordable. $.99 a taco!"}
{"text":"Giving an extra star for the most friendly drive thru server! First time I went ordered a chimi which was decent, but nothing memorable.   Last visit ordered some tacos and burrito, both of which were bland and sloppy. Quality over quantity counts unless just having run a marathon."}
{"text":"I read a lot of positive reviews about this place and had to try it out for myself. I came and got a lunch special and I have been going back ever since. I'm tired of the Roberto commercials talking about real authentic Mexican food, Roberto's has nothing on Tacos la Mexicana."}
{"text":"I ordered the rolled tacos combination with beef, they were just ok.  The beans were really runny and did not have much flavor and the rice was pretty standard.  I will try again to see if this was just an off day.  The service was great though!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! I like it better than  Roberto's Got 4 astada Tacos, beans and lettuce with tomatoes.  I think they just threw the lettuce and tomatoes on my plate, because I was suppose to get rice (I love rice, any kind of rice)  She told me as soon as the rice is ready she will bring it to me.  I love the condiment table, ohhhhh the pickled jalapenos.  I really liked the tacos!  the beans.......Well they could have kept that.  The lettuce and tomatoes, not sure how all that was suppose to be tied in with the rest of the meal, but what ever.....My rice never came.   So I decided when I get off work, I will come back here so I can bring a plate home to my husband.  So  I just told the cashier, that I will pick up my rice when I get off work.    I go back after work.  They already knew what the deal is!  That's pretty good service.  I ordered the same thing for my husband that I go for myself for lunch.  Tthey also gave me a free soda for my troubles.   So when I got home, and opened his plate!  WTF, I didn't get chips!  And he didn't get lettuce and tomatoes!  The chips were so good!  And the rice was the BOMB.COM!  They gave me a pint  and I ate the whole thing!  Next time, they can keep the beans, give me chips and rice!"}
{"text":"Always consistently delicious! The place is clean and the salsas are tasty. Get the pambazo, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"The Parrillada are the best in town! It includes chicken, carne asada and shrimp. The portion of food  serves 2 to 3 people. Make sure that you ordered it with time, because it takes around 15 minutes to be ready."}
{"text":"The shrimp cocktail was the worst thing I have ever tasted. The ketchup was too much and the 6-7 shrimp that were included were too small. We ordered 2 shrimp cocktails and 1 drink and the bill was over $28.00. Definitely not worth it and will not be coming back. Also, the cashier was not friendly at all."}
{"text":"One day several months ago I was trying to find a good taco shop close to work. With the courtesy of Yelp, I found the Tacos La Mexicana restaurant, so my friends and I decided to give it a try. Here's what I thought:  THE DECOR (3 out of 5) Nothing too special here as you would expect from any other taco shop in a little strip center. There are a limited number of tables here, but it usually isn't too much of a problem finding a place to sit after you've placed your order. The good part is that they do keep the dining area clean, and they have a couple of flat screen TVs to watch to pass the time.  THE FOOD (4 out of 5) Now, the food is the best part. I usually order the 4 taco lunch special which includes 4 tacos, beans, rice and a drink. With the tacos you just need to let them know what kind of meat that you want from Al Pastor, Chorizo, Carnitas, etc. The tacos taste fresh and are definitely delicious. The little salsa bar that they have setup on a small table may be a little lacking but at least they have the usual suspects with a couple of different salsas, carrots, jalapeños, and radishes.  THE PRICE (5 out of 5) So, the lunch special that I usually get is just $5.99 plus tax! So you won't be breaking the bank when eating at this restaurant.   OVERALL (4 out of 5) So, if you're on the west side of town and feel a hankering for some good but cheap eats, you should definitely give Tacos La Mexicana a try!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place (both locations). I don't want to go on and on about every detail, but just trust that you will get great quality food for super cheap. The staff is also really kind and awesome. Burritos are the size of your face and churros are to DIE for."}
{"text":"Been there twice and both times it was excellent. Best chicken burrito I had in my hood. Open late too and I likess it."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and i'm usually always craving Carne Asada fries or a California burrito and this place and robertos is the only 2 place i'd actually come back too. The staffs here are super friendly and the food comes out pretty quick. I usually get carne asada fries here because they have a huge portion of it and it looks like a giant cake. I always get a horchata here because usually other places make it super watery or not flavorful and so far this place makes it perfect! They also have plenty of sauces to choose from but my only complaint is that they don't have a lot of firecrackers or any cucumbers but it's okay. I recommend checking this place out if you're in the area! There's a huge parking area as well and they also have a drive thru when you don't want to dine in!"}
{"text":"They change the owners a few months ago and now the portions are smaller the salsa containers are smaller and they even charge you for extra salsa the flavor has change l used to love this place not anymore l'm going to have to find a better place.!!!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place on Durango for a long time and finally decided to try it.  I hit the drive thru with one car in front of me.  I ordered the cheese enchilada combo and a large diet coke.  The car in front of me waited at the window for about 10 minutes before receiving their order of one to-go container.  I drove up and the gentleman at the window apologized for the wait and took my money.  I waited at least another 7 or 8 minutes for them to finally get my order.  I then had to ask for my drink and some hot sauce as none was offered.  Now I sit at my computer at work with my order......that is wrong!  They gave me chicken enchiladas instead of the cheese.  In fact there was almost no cheese anywhere on or in these enchiladas!  There was almost no sauce on them either.  They were practically dry!  Overall, a pretty bad experience from slow service to getting the wrong food that was not very good.  Next time, I will go to the usual Robertos."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food! Love this place. Check out the new lunch specials. I got a carne quesadilla, rice, beans and a drink for $6.50. Great deal! The California burrito is also delicious!"}
{"text":"Love their food! Beans are amazing!!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! What a great surprise! Best Mexican food in town. If you want a real homemade quick tasty meal, this is the place to go! I've eaten at a lot of Mexican restaurants in town and this is by far the best! Try it and see! Very affordable, excellent service and the food is soooo good! My husband is a Latino who is very picky with Mexican food and he LOVES this place! We actually crave the food here. Give it a try, you'll love it too!"}
{"text":"Yummmmy!!!!!!!!!  This place is amazing!!! Real authentic drive thru mexican food!!! Omg! the best.  I was a little sad at first cause their menu showed no vegetarian option so I asked for a specific burrito without meat, the worker then told me they do in fact have a delicious vegetarian burrito.  My suggestion to them would be to put it on the menu.   Other then that this place is my go to fast mexican food."}
{"text":"Having been a huge fan when Robert own this store, I went back in June and it was so disappointing. BUT I went this past weekend and it was fantastic. I had the chili verde platter & carne asada tacos. My dinning companions had the carne asada burritos & a combo platter with the chicken tamale, cheese enchilada & chile rellano - all for under 25.00 with drinks. I would for sure recommend the salsa verde as my personal favorite and the side of guacamole came with a spicy kick.  Now that I'm writing this, I want to hop in my car and have some gorditas (which we got to go for lunch the following day) a little pocket of goodness.   If you haven't been in 2013, go back. The counter is new, it's bright and colorful plus the woman at the counter was very helpful tho the tall dude looking over her shoulder was handsome but made me nervous for her. She did great even with his spying.   Good deal for fresh made mex."}
{"text":"The tacos AL Pastor  and de carnitas are awesome.  The enchiladas are good too. Their green salsa is tasty.  I liked the Horchata because it wasn't super sweet.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This is authentic and it is pretty decent for Gringos.  They have a great lunch special, four soft tacos with your choice of any meat, pork or chicken, served with rice and beans, and a medium drink for $6.99.  I got one for each of my home remodeling crew, who all happen to be from Mexico, and they all agreed \"it was authentic\".   They also feature a full menu of other authentic Mexican foods you won't find at a Taco Bell, Del Taco, or other Gringo places pretending to be Mexican.   I ate dinner there and ordered the four taco plate combo, with a Chile Relano entree. Filled me up and pleased my taste buds.  My helper had the four taco plate, and he pronounced it \"real Mexican\".   It gets 3 stars, and not 4, because it is a simple eatery with a drive through, not a place with atmosphere. Also, the salsa bar lacked raddishes, onions, cilentro, and other delights you find in an authentic Mexican place.  None the less, great place for lunch or quick dinner, and a great value for the quality."}
{"text":"We always see this lil restaurant when we pay a visit over to CJ's next door but I only remember it from the days of the original owners of BeeGees :(  Anyway, we were craving some Mexican food so we decided to give them a try. When we walked in, there weren't very many customers so we were kind of weary at this point about continuing with our little adventure, but we proceeded on and ordered our food.  I ordered a plate that had 1 tamale and 1 chile relleno w/ beans and rice. I'm not asking to blow me out of the water, but the flavor on my entire plate was non-existent :(  Honestly, I'm no health inspector but I am pretty sure that the hot sauce containers have to completely be in ice, not just the bottom portion of it... AND there has to be the usual sneeze guards or at least covers not just random containers on a table in front of the bathroom?  Staff was uber nice but-- I'm sorry, not returning."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a whole in the wall, true Mexican place, it is here. Tacos are under $2 and they are so delicious. I had taco al pastor and a sope & sope bread was not store bought. It was mmm mmm good."}
{"text":"We got the lunch specials and they were such a great deal!! I chose the carne asada fries, and my son went for the tacos.  The meat and everything that came with the fries was actually super delicious! I was very impressed with the quality and it also comes with a drink. I was craving guac all bad and got a little side and it was like 1.50 for a side, under 2.00 anyway. It was actually pretty decent.  The inside is clean and the cashier was actually nice!  Come for the lunch specials!!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh & oversized,I can hardly ever finish my meal & for the prices it's very well worth it.This place beats Robertos Tacos by a long shot & is actually more authentic.The Chimichangas are huge & deep fried.Highly recommend them"}
{"text":"This was my first time and will be my last time eating here. I ordered the 4 rolled tacos combination and my bf ordered the #1 combination. Nothing had any flavor. Salt was definitely needed. I'd go to Roberto's any day over this place, and Roberto's usually forgets something in our order. The only reason I gave 2 star is because the drive thru employee was nice."}
{"text":"I love this family owned restaurant.  They do have two locations but this is the best one.  Their food has a great authentic flavor. They have the best carnitas in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am confident in saying this is the best fast-food Mexican restaurant I've been to.  Good quality food Good amount of food Good prices.   Food is just a little of a wait, as they make it upon your ordering. Order at the counter and they'll bring it to your table with silverware too. Four different choices of salsas that are all more flavorful than other places I've tried. Especially enjoy the enchiladas (3 +rice &beans $8) and of course, carne asada fries (around $8). Blows Roberto's out of the water, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Yelp always leads me to interesting place. This is a total hole in the wall. It's filled with local families, so that's a good sign. Don't let the Boost Mobile and massage parlor scare you off. We ordered the taco special ($6) and it was great. I'm giving it 5 stars because its very delicious and the kind of place worth hunting for."}
{"text":"Carnitas tacos all the way!  If I didn't listen to my belly, I could easily kill 10 of these suckers. So I stopped at 6, and surprisingly, did not feel gross afterwards. That's a 5 stars review in my neck of the woods.   Don't be fooled by the exterior, the bars aren't meant to keep you out, it's to protect you when you're inside. I've never felt so safe, watching Telemundo music videos, eating tacos, and hanging out with my buds."}
{"text":"Honestly, such great food! Had the combo: chicken enchiladas, corn tamale, chili rellenos, beans...I literally licked the plate."}
{"text":"Tacos La Mexicana is the place to go for lunch. For only $5.99, you get four tacos, rice, refried beans, and a small drink. I usually get their chicken and pastor (pork) tacos. The chicken is not particularly seasoned and is more like pulled chicken. The pastor is not the best that I've ever tried, but it is definitely decent. The food in general is tasty, and the price is even better.  I also like their small salsa bar. The red salsas are all delicious, and my favorite salsa is the green one (without seeds). It is packed with flavor and is definitely their spiciest salsa.  Overall, the service, price, and food is great and a must-try!"}
{"text":"Had the Carne Tacos. It was pretty good. Their beef had some seasoning to it so it wasn't bland.  The service was nice and there's a self serve salsa table, which I love."}
{"text":"Place is delicious. Nice upgrade from your Roberto's and Taco Bell with out breaking the bank. They have great daily specials and food always is fresh. My new spot for Mexican then head over to CJ's next door for dessert. Yeahhhhh!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come in here and very welcome they are great they never mess up on my order and the food is absolutely amazing there is nothing like this in Las Vegas Roberto does not compare guaranteed. I'm a very health conscious person and this place is still great. I never feel guilty because of the quality! Try dining in!"}
{"text":"Came here to have some tacos for lunch because it was close to my work. Can't beat their lunch special which is 4 tacos, rice, beans and a drink for $7.99! I ordered the chorizo, asada, al pastor and carnitas. The chorizo, al pastor and carnitas were solid. They also have a salsa bar which is right up my alley. I'll definitely be back for lunch another time to try some of their other tacos."}
{"text":"Not very good anymore just flavorless and kinda gross I don't know what happened the torta was really bland and dry my rolled tacos were just not good :-( I use to really like this place"}
{"text":"Lord. Have. Mercy.   I got the carne asada fries without jalapeños and before I fully took a bite, I already knew it would be good. When I actually took the bite, it was just good, but delicious! I wholeheartedly believe that it's better than Roberto's!!   I had bought Buffalo sauce to add to it because I had tried it that way while at Papas and Beer in Ensenada and loved it. I didn't need it for the fries from here but I added a little and it only made it better!   Customer service was great, food was great, I definitely will return to this restaurant for their food."}
{"text":"Someone needs to taste the food before serving it because nothing had flavour. I was hoping from the reviews for those deep rich flavours synonymous with Mexican food but this just ended up with bland tasteless food."}
{"text":"When ever I crave Tacos and don't wanna go in the restaurant I just stop by here and drive through it lol. Staff are friendly and the Tacos? Tacos are bomb! Tacos are life! Lol my only concern is that the Elotes can be better. Just they're so hot and steaming that when they put the toppings on, everything melts off. They could just sit the Corn or chill it for a bit before placing toppings on. Other then that. Good place for quick Tacos!"}
{"text":"This particular location has changed owners about 4 times in the past year. They recently opened Tacos La mexicana and I really liked it. The portions and prices are pretty good. I tried the burrito with the flan and it was delicious. to give you a better idea of this place is like going to Robertos, but a bit more scale (not too much, just a bit) Tip: do not miss their lunch special, 2 tacos, rice & bean + soda for 6 bucks!!  Apparently they are well know for the huaraches! Gotta try them next time!"}
{"text":"This place has the original Mexican food!!!!  I love borittos my friend got the hard shell tacos with fries and we both loved it!!! The device was OK but the food was AMAZING!!!!  Prices are fair 8$ with fries and drink, u can't beat that.... I got my wife the vegan option to go and she enjoyed every bite!!  C U next time"}
{"text":"Me and a friend stopped by to pick up some dinner to go. The lady at the register, Diana, was so nice. She took time out of her day to describe some of the foods that we had questions about. Super nice staff, friendly and makes you feel like you are a part of the family. The food is so good and flavorful. Will keep going back again and again!!"}
{"text":"I needed a street taco fix so we drove cross town to and decided to share a 4-taco platter that included beans and Spanish rice.  My wife chose 2 with al pastor while I settled on a pastor and a chorizo.  All were authentic (that's good), but the chorizo made my taste buds do the Shimmy, Shimmy Shake."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the service I received tonight was the worst I have ever received . I decided to stop by and go through the drive thru when i was handing out my card she dropped it no problem I got out to grab it . When the food came she put too many boxes in the bag I could barely grab the handles . Then I when my drink came she didn't close he lid and it literally spilled all over my car door inside and out all over my legs and shirt . No sorry no nothing she closed the window right away and walked away . I work in. The industry and we have accident I understand but some napkins would be good . I might return but never through drive thru very careless service there  Also they need to do something about their containers since they put the hot food it gets the flavor styrofoam taste in it . Pretty gross .."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here 3 times in one week and they always hook it up on the salsa. Both piña and jicama are bomb as well. I usually get the taco combo."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner. Had four street tacos, Al Pastor. Although not \"shaved\" from meat on the spit, they were  as good if not better than Pepe's in Puerto Vallarta! They also have elote!!"}
{"text":"Better than Roberto's, also the only tamales in town I actually like. Wife loves the tacos al carbon. Prices are on point as well. The only reason this place isn't more popular is because of the akward drive thru, but less line to wait through for those who've discovered it :) It's funny to me that this is right next to Taco Bell. That's actually the reason we ended up trying it haha. Be back soon!"}
{"text":"1.69 for a nice shredded chicken taco is a nice price and tasted good  the food was ready pretty fast as well. Next time I will try the chicken burrito. Not to mention I go up and down Decatur in this area all the time so it is a easy stop"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  Hole in the wall kinda place, but nicer than Roberto's and the food is 100x better.  I get the 4 taco (carnitas) special with rice and beans for $6.49 a couple times a week!  Try it...you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I've seen some negative reviews for this store and for the life of me, I can't understand why.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  We use GrubHub to get delivery and have never had a problem.  Highly recommended, although we think the $5 delivery fee should be adjusted based on mileage from the store.  I am disabled and can't easity get to the store, which is literally down the street.  Perhaps they can make changes to this in the future, but it's still totally worth it in my opnion."}
{"text":"It's the first time I've seen pambazo on the menu. I saw on tv once and wanted to give it a try. My husband got a fish taco and shrimp tacos and the taco salad to share. My mom in law got the chile relleno. The pambazo was really good! I couldn't eat it like a regular sandwich so I had to use a knife and a fork. The bread was drenched in the sauce but still wasn't overly soggy. The tacos were ok. The chile relleno was super cheesy and great. I'm not sure if the taco salad was supposed to have dressing but I was too embarrassed to ask lol I just threw some salsa and sour cream on it and it was good. The service was good, the lady at the counter answered all our questions. Great Mexican food for a fair price :D"}
{"text":"This literally a hole in the wall restaurant, but good! I would pass by it all the time and see that it had a drive thru so I was like how good can this Mexican food be if it had a drive through? Well I was totally wrong it is deff a through me in for a loop. Only down fall is that the place was superrrr hot in there couldn't eat my food in peace because I was sweating .. but overall was pretty good decent food! If your on the go and want some Mexican food this deff is the place to go!"}
{"text":"A fine Mexican joint with good food, good prices, and a slightly hole in the wall interior. They use Mexican cheese instead of jack or mozarella which gives their quesadilla and beans with cheese a delicious, authentic flavor. Had some chorizo tacos and the meat was stellar.  Nice spice and the corn tortillas were cooked to perfection.  Highly recommend this place.   If you're used to eating at Roberto's you will find this place is leagues better and with lower prices to boot."}
{"text":"They location on spring mountain and Twain has the best carnitas in town,  they are greasy but that's what make them taste so good. They close at 8 pm but now have a taco cart in front of there location for great late night food.  They also have a great lunch special during the week with 4 tacos bean and rice with a drink for around six bucks. I have never had a bad meal from here."}
{"text":"This one is from a 100% Mexican. So I seen this place, and I thought I would give it a try. My honey order the carne asada tacos, and I order the carne asada burrito, the carne was dry, like it was cooked and set apart, they don't cook it right when you ordered, is cook before. I had the \"hot\" salsa, it was just water, the burrito was flavorless. Just stick to what you know. I wish I had gone to Taco Bell. Believe me, I'm not going back to this place."}
{"text":"Opening day free food! Thank you. Cheese quesadilla was excellent. Daughter enjoyed the french fries. Tried the red salsa and the brown salsa. The brown was pretty good and the red was excellent. Chips were okay, but I tend to like a thinner chip. Restaurant was bright and clean, service was fast and cheerful and the overall quality of food was great. I will go back."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. They add ingredients that aren't on the menu to ur food.  3rd time here and everytime worse. Go to reburtios , they don't add things that aren't on the menu ."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap and tasty - these are the three things I love the best about Tacos La Mexicana. The 5.99 lunch special includes 4 tacos, rice, beans and a drink. I will say, though, that all of the tacos are not created equal, and I seem to forget that every time. So, reminder to self: Your fave taco is the carnitas! Just get 4 of those next time.   Besides those three things, I also appreciate that the tacos taste fresh, are not greasy and have never left me with an uneasy feeling, as some tacos do. The tacos aren't huge, and the tortillas are not homemade, but I think both of these factors are overcome with a helping of the fresh salsas. I do miss the little salsa bar they have at the original location, but maybe they will bring that to this location soon.  Also, bonus drive thru. If you don't want to get out of your car, you don't have to!"}
{"text":"I have already been back because it is cheap, good, and I really wanted to try a tamale. The cashier recommended the chicken tamale, and let's just say I ended up ordering a second! The tamale was all of the comfort food goodness that I love in a well-executed tamale. And this time, we tried all three salsas. There may only be three, but as with most things in life: quality over quantity! And, the selection of red and green salsa is definitely quality. When you combine value with solid execution, you earn your stars!"}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying the food is amazing. Great variety of salsas and the food has a nice twist compared to a normal robertos . But ( there is always a but ) the service is awful . Very rarely do they get my order right and it always takes forever to receive your order. The thing that makes me the most upset about this place is that they are never open! There is a huge sign outside that says \" drive thru open until 1am\" . We go there multiple times a month after work at night around 11pm and they are never open . Sometimes the lights are on but they will tell us they are closed. If they are closing earlier they need to take the sign down . Very misleading and rude to customers."}
{"text":"Strike 1: burnt or old tasting oil the chips are fried in. Strike 2: guacamole is no guacamole. This is \"avocado-color inspired sauce\" sure, it was $0.75, but charge me double for some quality, not this garbage that tastes nothing like guacamole. Strike 3: no napkins.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"This place is my GO-TO for mexican food coming from a girl who grew up in So Cal her whole life. I still yet have to go to some other hyped up places, but the quality here is you'll get really good authentic stuff. My favorites are the tacos rancheros (al pastor) and rolled taquitos (chicken)."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Vegas! Always freshly prepared! They never disappoint! Carne asada fries are the best along with everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"What this place needs are better employees.  The food here is...  Okay.  It's not great.  The chips aren't that good but the quesadilla was alright.  The problem here is they screwed up my order and gave me incorrect menu items.  Also, they gave me MUCH TO MUCH guacamole for the amount of chips and charged me $2 for it rather than 50¢ like the menu stated.  The girl behind the counter didn't care when I brought it to her attention.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with tacos la Mexicana. I was initially excited when I walked in and learned they actually had a vegan option for me and the cook knew what vegan was. Normally most Mexican places have chicken powder or stock in their rice. And or pork fat in their beans so I can never eat them. This place offers both without animal products in them. So I ordered a vegan burrito to go adding guacamole. I paid and left after receiving my burrito. I get home and bite into and initially I was like hmm not bad but I don't taste guacamole and think maybe it's more in the middle so I open it up to see and there's no guacamole. I proceeded to call and they answer I tell the lady what's wrong and said no they put it in. Then says hold on to ask the cook and they said they put it in. I tell it's not and take a picture as proof. They offered to make another if I returned back. I inform them I do not live near by and she says oh ok sorry bye. I call back because I was in shock by the rudeness. So I tell them I will return because I wasn't happy.  She offered me a side of guacamole as an alternative and I tel I her I wanted it in my burrito like I ordered. And she says ok bye again. I'm baffled at this so I head back down there and hand them the burrito opened to show that the guacamole was missing. She turns around showing the cook and proceeded to make another. I tell them no I don't want another because first they were rude by hanging up on me. And second they were rude for saying I was lying about not having guacamole. And third because thy had a child around the age of ten or younger running around the kitchen. So I just ask for my money back and leave. If they would've handled it a lot more courteously things would've went fine but once you're rude all customer care goes out the window. Completely disappointed."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting, and our last. We had hard tacos, an enchilada, chips, and a burrito. Everything fried was super greasy and you could taste that the oil they used was super old. The enchilada was a soft taco with sauce on it. The burrito was bland and nothing special. Definitely not a second timer. I would have had better food at taco bell next door, and for cheaper."}
{"text":"This place was my favorite a couple of years ago and after moving back, it was one of the first places I went to eat at but the food is just not the same. I ordered some enchiladas and the chicken was super dry. I'm pretty sure the popped the enchiladas in the microwave before serving them, as an enchilada enthusiasts that made me so sad. My friend got some carne asada tacos and I stole a bite- they were okay, not the best I've had. You can tell how good a place is by tasting their basics- the rice and beans were not good. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Popped in for a couple breakfast burritos with the wifey this morning. Good sized burritos with plenty of eggs, taters & bacon inside. The tortillas were cooked perfectly, where they're slightly golden brown & crispy.  My only complaint was the burritos seemed a little dry... A lil' sour cream on the inside would compliment them nicely."}
{"text":"Popped in for a few tacos today... The carne asada was lacking in flavor, no marinade, and pretty bland. The carnitas were very good and I'd eat a dozen at one sitting :)"}
{"text":"I found this place on my travels and let me tell you that it's real Mexican food at a great price, the tacos were some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican flavor. Big selection of food. Sopes and chiles rellenos are a must. Gotta love this place."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! Love this place. Food is delicious, very clean place and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Good service, reasonable prices and delicious food I give this place 10-star's if I could. Although it would help if the place was bigger because when it gets busy people start complaining that there's not enough tables and they start trying to rush customers out. But other than that I recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was on a TACO Mission !!! And this place was the 3rd place I ended up at. IT SHOULD OF BEEN THE 1ST .!! The food is amazing. Don't be a fool stop by and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Worst service all we ordered was carne asada nachos and fries and it took them 30 minutes to prepare.  When we asked them how long will it take she looked at us like she didn't remember what we ordered.  Yeah I guess she forgot since it took so long.  Won't be coming back here a"}
{"text":"We seriously went to three other taco shops looking for AUTHENTIC STREET TACOS, I have known about Tacos La Mexicana for a while now, but never took them seriously because they are next to a frozen custard shop. But after frustration I said HEY let's try it. I looked up the reviews, which were great. This is legit the best Mexican Food we have had in Vegas so far. We just moved here from Sparks, and we're really missing our old food joints. The service was WONDERFUL! The food was so amazing g, my fiancé cleaned his plate. You feel like you are in your neighbors kitchen, very homey. The orange salsa was super good, and the Supreme Wet burrito was AMAZING! We will be back, and it's close to home!"}
{"text":"I've always loved coming to this place because it tastes more authentic than a lot of other Mexican joints. The hours it's open also helps for someone who works random times! Prices are great for the amount of food you get. Can't really miss out with this place!"}
{"text":"Carne asada nachos, hard shell tacos, mulitas, alambre la mexicana, and elotes! Everything was great! I had no idea what alambre la mexicana was, but we decided to try it based on the photo. Its sooo good! Smells great, and tastes amazing! You wrap it like a fajita.   Great local spot we found for Cinco de mayo!"}
{"text":"The food portions are generous but the food is somewhat bland. The person taking orders seemed impatient and unfriendly when taking our order despite the fact that there were no customers waiting on us. The prices were quite average in comparison to similar restaurants.   Do not order their guacamole. I ordered a really small portion and when I received the order, I thought there was a mistake since I got a salsa instead which was available in their complimentary salsa bar. The excuse I received when I called them out on it was that the one I received was different from their salsa bar. (Big Lie!)"}
{"text":"Tacos small but so tasty. I didn't like the red wet burrito and beans had a weird taste. Definitely would order tacos again but not the burrito I couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for lunch with my mom. It's near our restaurant so and my mom had been through the drive through a couple times.  Not to sure how I feel about this place. We sat inside for their lunch special. I had chicken tacos and corn. I notice that they don't serve seafood. I'm happy that they have chicken option since I don't eat meat. Crunchy taco was decent. I opted for all rice no beans.   I'm not a fan here but my mom is."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican food.  Way better than crappy Robertos. The lunch specials are really good deals. They went up on the prices though so that sucks. But I highly recommend if you want real Mexican food that will satisfy your taste buds"}
{"text":"Best mexican fast food in Vegas hands down!!!!!! Love the breakfast burritos, LOVE the beans, LOVE their burritos!!!"}
{"text":"This authentic taco shop is not to be missed. The grilled beef taco salad was delicious and a great value. The service was excellent by Diana.  She was happy and helpful. I really suggest you try this little gem in Las Vegas off Decatur."}
{"text":"Authentic mexican food. Get it made your way. Hard tacos & Calientê picante salsa. Smells sooo good and is located next to a Taco Bell lpl.  Very nice service. Made to order. Only $1.99 for hard tacos beef or chicken, and real shredded cheese. They werent tight on the salsa either. I had it to go they incl. limes napkins without me asking. Sooo yummy. Ill def. be back."}
