{"text":"'Forget about it' - I had a really disappointing experience here. Came here not too long ago and tried their 25$ set menu three course dinner special.   Three friends and I ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes. It came with soup and a tiramisu - you pretty much can't go wrong salmon and mashed potatoes but they did !   To start the soup came with a decent portion but tasted more so diluted than I would have liked. The salmon with mashed potatoes however was really weird - the presentation was super sloppy, basically just slapping everything together onto the plate and hoping that will do. The salmon was bland, the 'house sauce' was too sour but the mashed potatoes was extremely off.... I think they mixed in parsley and a few different types of herbs into it. The portion of the salmon was not consistent as well. Two of my friends got extremely large pieces but another friend and I got barely anything in which I felt really cheated on. Also nothing on that dish complimented each other, it was literally just slapped together or to fill the plate....  We were in a rush to head out and I didn't review the bill thoroughly enough but when the bill came it included 15% worth of tips already but I wasn't informed and gave double the tips. I mean the service was decent and attentive but really no amount of \"good service\" can make up for the horrible quality of food."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, service is good, price is reasonable. I would go again, but I would not order the Caprese salad. The tomatoes were not quite ripe and the cheese was too cold. Pizza was excellent"}
{"text":"Delicious food, filling but not too filling. Pleasant atmosphere, nicely garnished food. Really nice for a casual restaurant.  Nothing really bad to say about the place. My friends and I really enjoyed the food we ordered."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying the service was fantastic. I have never felt more waited on.  Asian wait staff at an Italian restaurant makes for an interesting ambiance. This along with the excellent Chianti forces me to give the two stars.   For the second time in 24 hours, my husband was again lured off the street with the promise of food and a good deal: $25 for a three course meal! YEE HAW as we say in the states.  The little pizza squares were obviously the Red Baron variety -- frozen you know and only served to make us feel like this was the beginning of something special,  some kind of gourmet offering, of which it was neither!  The first course was the salad, which was OK. They had pretty fresh greens here and the couple caramelized walnuts I found in there were a nice touch. The canned beets though ? Whew! I pushed those to the corner of my plate.  Next, came the pappardelle with asparagus, arugula (where was it?) and tomatoes in a saffron sauce. Even my non-foodie husband agreed, it tasted like Lipton's alfredo noodles. I imagined Robert Irvine discovering a vat of powdered mix  in the back! For shame! Still, when the waiter obliged me with an extra grate of parmesan cheese (he comes round Olive Garden style) and I added a few shakes of salt and pepper, it was not half bad.  The final course was tiramisu. This was definitely right out of box. No taste whatsoever.  So, Torontonians and tourists to Toronto, this is one meal you would like to say later to yourself \"Forget About It\", but am forced to recall because it was so remarkably well, unremarkable. It is presented as if ambrosia by a wait staff that is attentive. It's not their fault the owners are using Sysco in their pantries, probably thinking it's saving money."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food.  $25 for 3 courses is a good deal for the entertainment district.  Would definitely return if visiting the area.  We ordered the organic salad, stuffed chicken, salmon and oyster mushroom pasta with creme caramel for dessert.  Very classy place."}
{"text":"I ate here with my parents this Sunday early evening ~16:30, right after we were done seeing a show at the Princess of Wales Theater, not far away from this place. We picked the place out of the bunch since my parents are fussy eaters and international cuisine outside of Europe and NA is not for them.  The place is very nicely decorated, classy furniture and decor. When we got in, the place was quite empty, but soon began to fill up. Possibly by other patrons also leaving a show. Even with the place filling up fast, service was good. Food was slower to arrive towards the end because demand increased fast, but it was nothing to object about, as they handled the rush pretty well and delays were not bad.  They have a quite good and long wine list, mainly focusing on Italian wines. If you're looking for good wine, this place should have you covered. Unfortunately, I was driving, so I did not get a chance to sample anything from the list. If I knew there was good wine in the area I would not have ordered a glass from the theater during intermission. The theater wine was not very good. I recommend you come here for drinks before or after the show, if you're going to a show in the area.  Even with the subsequent rush, service was quite good. The servers were on point and courteous. They made sure all things we ordered were clear to us, including the extra charge that we got, because we ordered an extra basket of garlic bread. The first one was on the house (and a lot of people got it, so it may be a standard on some days), any extras are $4, which was fine by us since it was quite tasty. They even apologized profusely for the delay, which wasn't even all that bad, but it was nice of them to do so. They also anticipated our needs well and filled up our water glasses without us having to ask, which was nice.  We all ordered minestrone soup and my mother had chicken parmigiana. I had fettuccine alfredo. The food was all quite tasty and everyone enjoyed their dishes. The fettuccine alfredo was what you would expect given the decor and atmosphere, so quite good. Not necessarily traditional, if you're into that, but this is like most North American Italian restaurants, adapting to local tastes. If you're not picky about that, it is exactly what you would expect from a place like this. Food was well cooked, very tasty and the presentation was quite nice and appetizing as well.  The only reason this did not get 5 stars is that it does not overly impress. It is exactly what you would expect of a nice NA Italian restaurant. Food was good, service was good and they had good wine. There was nothing about it that stood out from the crowd, but if you're looking for a good Italian place in the entertainment district, this should serve you well."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. Extremely rude and confrontational waiter. Subpar food.   My group of 5 reserved a table in advance and when we arrived we were welcomed by a nice young lady. We sat down and had terribly slow service, and the restaurant was empty besides 3 occupied tables.   The food arrived and was not satisfying at all. We had to call the waiter 3 times before he would actually come over.   THE WORST SERVER IVE EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE-  middle aged gentleman with a bald head  We asked for separate checks and he said okay.   We all pay and leave ~10% tips. The service wasn't that great and they didn't deserve any more than that.    As we get to the door the bald waiter confronts us in a extremely rude tone and says \"Excuse me but we don't separate checks, you can't do this again- also you can't leave a 10% tip, some of you only left $4 dollars!!! **This isn't how things work around here!! Thanks.\" And he stormed off before I had the chance to respond to him and his ignorance.   He has been scamming costumes according to other Yelp reviews also. He must be a relative to the owner because there's no way he should be getting away with this inns propriety behaviour."}
{"text":"This restaurants is one of the best places to have pasta on king west. They have variety of pastas including spicy sausage linguini , penne with chicken, chicken Alfredo pasta. I would not recommend the veal scaloppini since the quality and taste was not that good. We tried different pasta dishes and all of them were amazing. The staff are very nice and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Bleh. I'm getting really sick of having subpar meals along this renowned \"entertainment district\" strip.   Forget About It is another average 2-3 star place in this long line of mostly disappointing eating establishments. It has the edge on many other nearby restaurants because at least it's cheap-ish here - three courses for $25.   The service is pleasant enough and the inside is darkly lit and relaxing with some nice comfortable booths for larger groups.  The food is fine, nothing spectacular, nothing bad. Was disappointed that my vegetarian angel hair pasta came with so few vegetables and was really just mounds of pasta with mostly sun dried tomatoes. Mushroom soup was a bit watery but tasty enough.  Really is one of those places where everything is \"just ok\" and nothing remarkable one way or the other."}
{"text":"I have dined here twice now and have found the food of good value and the service efficient and courteous. Both times we were off to a play and our timeliness was never in jeopardy.  The decor is a little odd because of the huge entry way that turns into a dance club later at night, but the ambiance is otherwise comfortable and quiet. To date, I have had the veal scallopini twice: slight hint of lemon and herbs, tender and flavourful. Although the presentation of the prosciutto and melon was somewhat hohum, the melon was firm without being underripe and the prosciutto was well-cured without being tough or stringy. We also had the straciatella soup, which came piping hot and delicately flavoured.  In all, we have not been disappointed with the food, service, or the value. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend while we were in a huge rush waiting for a show at the Princess of Wales (just like everyone else, hah. I see they are used to it).  Server was very helpful.  They brought out \"complimentary\" appetizers, which were pizza squares, and not that great, but our dinner (the seafood antipasto appetizer, and the pizza with scallops) was delicious! We had to eat it so fast that we nearly inhaled it, but the server was incredibly understanding with us trying to make our show, and wrapped up so quickly!  I would like to come back here when I have more time and actually savor the food, but it was very good, with great service (although I felt so sorry for the poor girl who had to stand in the freezing cold and try to get people to come in! I think that's ridiculous)."}
{"text":"Had a meal with my girlfriend. Tasty freebie of small square pizzas free glasses of water. The waiter was friendly and quite funny. Service great and good tasty food. Price average."}
{"text":"It's a classy and affordable joint right on King Street. I've passed by this place hundreds of times to/from work but never been inside until I went for a birthday dinner. It was a Saturday night during a cold snap so there were only 2 other tables - service was quick and service was friendly considering.   We were a table of 8 and most of us ordered the prix fixe menu: $25 for an app, entree, and dessert. Everyone enjoyed their meal and nobody was hungry. No complaints about any dishes, we ordered items inclusion lobster bisque, salmon, seafood linguini, seafood risotto, chocolate mousse cake, and lemon cake.  I was pleasantly surprised and I'd be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I shared a pizza and a pasta. Both were phenomenal and the price was amazing! Great value for such an awesome meal! Service was perfect. Music and ambiance was perfect as well. If I could afford to eat out all the time I would make this place a staple in my life"}
{"text":"We went here before a show and had an excellent meal. The service was great. I had tortellini in a cream sauce that was delicious and my partner had veal filets that were exquisite.  Price was very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Great spot, fantastic service, reasonable prices, and good food. 3 course dinner for $25 I had the organic garden salad, salmon, and creme caramel. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Much better than one would expect from the name. After a lot of walking around, we settled on this place solely for its convenience, but we enjoyed a surprisingly good meal as well. Though staff was pretty harried when we sat down, we got good service in short time. We ordered the prix-fixe and were served perfectly cooked meals, beautifully presented with interesting flavors.   Given the name and the location of this place, you'd be right to expect the worst. But the night we went in, we were delighted with a delicious, skillfully prepared meal at an amazing price."}
{"text":"We came here on Christmas Eve as it was one of the only restaurants open in the area. The service was mediocre the waiter, the food was average (I could've probably made a better chicken fusilli at home) and the drinks were terrible (I ordered a martini that tasted like rubbing alcohol and bleach and a Long Island that was no better) - save your $$."}
{"text":"From appetizer to dessert is superb , this restaurant you'll forget everything . Just forget about it. Luv luv luv....."}
{"text":"Trying to find somewhere to eat on a Saturday night in the Entertainment District was a challenge.  Two places we asked to seat our party of 8 was met with rejection.  Ultimately we came across Forget About It and saw their comfy interior dining room booths and their menu, we decided to give them a try.  The menu was pretty varied with pastas, salads, and some heartier meat choices.  I got the caprese salad and the porcini mushroom fettucine.  The bread at the beginning of the meal was nice but not super tasty.  Just carb filler.    The service when we were there was decent.  They filled water glasses often and took our dishes away soon after we finished.  My particular food choices were OK...not spectacular or special.  I don't even recall if they had any dinner specials of the night...I probably would've ordered if any were offered.  With so much fierce competition on that block on King Street, I can see how this place has up and down business.  I think in terms of Italian food, they do a decent job with prices that are about standard for the other joints along the street."}
{"text":"Tried their $25 3-course meal today. Soup was little bland and the entree came in small portions, but presentation was nice. Dessert was okay but nothing spectacular. Service was good for most parts. The atmosphere inside is classy. Decent place overall."}
{"text":"Shrimp Risotto was terrible...all I could taste was salt like I was eating a microwave dinner- it was definitely NOT fresh which you would expect at these prices. All the waiters but one treated you like you were at a food-truck. Their demeanour is like they don't care about you and they're just doing their job. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We had a pre-fixed menu on Canada's day which turns out to be good! Servers was very friendly! Hostess helped us find a perfect table where we can put our stroller next to it. It's spacious inside and great for families with young kids maybe not late at night because it becomes a lounge."}
{"text":"\"Forget about it\" really...if you would actually want to come here....I would suggest same as the name....they only thing that appealed to me was the $25, 3 course meal on King St. Like come on, how is that even possible...so live with the price, eat and leave...don't expect too much...in terms of the food and service.  We ended up ordering the 3-course meal and expectedly it was a disappointment.. I thought going for pasta would have been a safe choice but it was tasteless and bland..ordered the tomato soup and that wasn't good either...tasted like tomato paste mixed with water...   At the end, we recieved a chocolate cake slice, it was the best dish of the evening...the dessert...sighs...I really want to know how they survived on King St. For soo long with this quality of food when the neighbors saint tropez, Marcel didn't survive thru these tuf times....  All in all,  doesn't live up to any expectation...won't be back...."}
{"text":"Went this place on Saturday night.   It was busy, but a receptionist and waiters are nice and efficient.   A receptionist took us to a table as soon as we got there, and a waiter came to our table with menus quickly, brought food quickly and offered and brought cheese and pepper quickly.  He brought a bill quickly as soon as we asked it.  He also checked our table if everything is good or not several times without disturbing our conversation.  All food that we ordered was great.  Prices were just right.  We are a fan of this place.   Would like to go back there very soon."}
{"text":"Service was great. The food very authentic and fresh. A wonderful experience.  Thoroughly recommended."}
{"text":"Nothing special, but not a bad choice in the Entertainment District either - the $25 prix fix menu is not bad - you're not getting huge portions, but that's pretty much fine with me. Nice wine list with lots of options, friendly and prompt service, and all in all I was happy."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat while visiting Toronto with our 3 boys. If you've been on this part of King St you know the hosts are on the street and try to get you to come in. After walking for a while we gave in and were seated in what felt like a basement but was the main dining room. The large booth was comfy. Wasn't that packed and the ace was adequately staffed. Staff was attentive and our server was very nice. Food was VERY average. We had chicken pasta, salmon, linguine with porcini mushrooms, chix pawn and a cheese pizza. The cheese pizza was the highlight and my 14 year old said he loved the chicken parm which is never a good sign in my book. Just didn't seem home made, like it was all warmed up and as another reviewer mentioned like it was all off the Sysco truck. Not bad but don't expect anything special. Kids will like it. We were dying to know what the Italian party of 12 was saying next to us about the food!"}
{"text":"Service was ok but that was it. Stumbled in here because children screaming they were starving and not knowing the area went w the first place we saw that had something kids would eat.  Overpriced, subpar Italian food sums up this place perfectly. Food wasn't what we ordered but didn't want to wait for it to be made correctly. Minestrone soup had angel hair pasta in it and pizza was over cooked.  Not sure why people call it classy-- I certainly wouldn't."}
{"text":"Very tasty Italian fare with some kind of extra flavor in each item to make it special. Service was attentive. Would definately come here again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and their dinner specials are good deal! The service is great too, I received complimentary champagne. It's a nice spot for a dinner date. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, artistically presented. Warm,friendly, attentive staff. A relaxing atmosphere. All at a very reasonable price. Prefect way to relax after a busy day. A must stop in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We are never going back there again. It was an absolute nightmare all the mistakes the server kept making and when we finally got our meal it was cold and tasted disgusting. Because of all the delays when we finally left we were late arriving at the Royal Alexandra Theatre.  We paid in cash and left a note on the napkin asking the manager to fire the waiter."}
{"text":"Given that this is in the heart of the entertainment district, people come here before and after shows in the area. We had reservations for earlier in the evening, and the place was completely empty so we had our pick of the entire place. I don't recommend this place for those dressed casually as the place definitely projects class.  I'm afraid I can't say as much for the food on the other hand. Nothing really stands out here, everything is safe Italian \"inspired\" cuisine that's mildly seasoned, lacking the soul of traditional Italian. They try really hard to impress, and I give them an A for effort  but the food falls flat here.   Recommendations  - Browse the exceptional wine list - Tiramisu"}
{"text":"We were walking around looking at other places with over an hour wait. We stumbled upon the location and decided to give it a try. We were pleased to be seated right away. Very attentive staff and delicious food. The chicken futile was really good."}
{"text":"We arrived just after opening on a Tuesday night and we were the first patrons of the evening.  A nice gentleman ushered us in from the sidewalk and the waiter gave us a nice table by the window.  Service was fast and pleasant, and the food was delicious.  We both had Caesar salads; I had shrimp risotto and my boyfriend had the chicken parm.  We were both pleased and the prices were great.  My boyfriend was a huge fan of the garlic bread!  We were too full for dessert but may just have to return for dessert next time we are in town."}
{"text":"4.5 solidly.   I don't know why people would knock down forget about it. This was one of my go-to restaurants in 2012 (I must have gone in there a solid dozen times) and they treated us like kings at each turn.   Great for special occasions, accommodating of big parties and walk-ins on the most part, wonderful menu and wine selection, and super friendly service. Trust me, it's damn near risk free.   I RECOMMEND: The Veal Quattro Formaggio    This grilled veal tenderloin with a spinach and a four cheese sauce is divine, and while it's served with vegetables & potatoes, I always ask for a alfredo pasta substitution and they have always catered to my whims :)   EXTRA TIP: Head waiter gives great wine pairing suggestions"}
{"text":"Have been there quite a few times and will continue to go there quite a few times.  The waitstaff is respectful and courteous. If you have questions about the menu or about suggestions, they will answer you truthfully. If you talk to them, they will talk to you back! They are quite friendly and efficient (especially on nights when they're not swamped with guests) and are always willing to give a suggestion of where to go. Not to mention they are always well dressed.  The ambiance is beautiful. It is quite a formal restaurant, they have candles, table clothes and napkins so you know you're being taken care of, but if you want something a little bit more casual, you can always sit outside on their lovely patio (also table clothed) and enjoy the summer breeze.   The food is amazing. I have never ordered anything there I didn't like. Usually, if you're nice and they're not super swamped, they can custom make dishes, switch out sauces and pastas and add whatever you'd like. I usually get a seafood alfredo with linguini and it is DELICIOUS. Their soups are usually made the day of, very fresh and always delicious. Their cream of mushroom is my favourite because there's always chunks of mushroom in it. Their pizzas are made Italian style, with thin crusts and are always done to perfection.  For dessert, I recommend their tiramisu cake, soft and not too strong.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The name seriously says it all.  Don't listen to the pretty girl outside, this place is terrible.  The decor is nice, but the quality of the food doesn't match at all.  The waiter was miserable and poured half glasses of water.  Before our meal came out, we were given \"complimentary pizzas\" which were square inch pieces of stale bread smothered in what tasted like Ragu sauce.  I ordered the meat lasagne, which was drowning in tomato sauce and cheap mozzarella cheese. My boyfriend ordered the pasta with spicy sausage - the pasta was undercooked and the sausage was chewy.  Save your money and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 8:30pm on a Friday expecting the place to be busy. Upon arrival the restaurant was dead only 2 other tables. Maybe this should have been a red flag. The host greeted us and asked where we'd prefer to sit (we chose the booth). They have a price fixe menu it's $25 for 3 courses. I got the salad which was okay... it was just sliced tomatoes with cheese... i was expecting something a bit more exciting but for $25 i guess you get what you pay for. For my main course i got the chicken which was really lacking flavour and the portion was small. Then for desert i chose the lemon yogurt cake which i liked it was refreshing.  The service was great because there was only 2 other tables... this place is honestly mediocre nothing special at all. This area has many other restaurants, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of the city. The restaurant looked very outdated.  The cannoli was seem like it was made from frozen, lacked of flavour, with a mushy texture. The veal parmigiana was also horrendous. Soggy and not crispy at all. Only plus side was the free garlic bread."}
{"text":"It was an average meal, but there were some high points.  The atmosphere is extremely nice, and it was especially warm on such a cold winter day.  As well, food presentation was very different and visually pleasing.  I would try this place again some time in the future, but I'm not rushing back for another meal.  Not bad though."}
