{"text":"I love Japanese food and have been to many Japanese restaurants throughout the years.  This is the worst ever.

I went to this place because I was traveling and it's right next to the hotel.

Two of us sat down and ordered a beer and sashimi deluxe combo each.  For $21.95, the dish was a joke.  It comes with 2 pieces of salmon, 2 pieces of tuna, 2 pieces of tilapia.  The pieces were small and poorly cut.  The fish were irregular shaped and some pieces were still dangling together.  It also came with a tuna roll and a salmon roll, both were small and poorly cut.  

The quality of the fish was poor.  Well, not quite fish gone bad yet, but I had doubt about the sushi grade quality.

The worst part was the deceitful practice by the restaurant.   The menu stated the sashimi deluxe should also include Hamachi (yellow tail) and Saba (makerel). 
We flagged down the waiter (who was rarely seen even though we were the only table at dinner time that are not at the Habachi side.) to confront him about the missing pieces and he said they were out of Hamachi and will bring us some Makerel.

Really!  Mr. Waiter (an older asian guy, which I think is the owner) was hoping we wouldn't notice the missing pieces.

After 15 min, he brought out 2 tiny pieces of Makerel for me and my friend and warned us that it was kind of frozen.  Swallowing that left a bad bitter taste in my mouth literally.

We didn't feel bad to leave a little tip at this place.
Normally, no matter how bad the food is, I paid at least 15% tip because the waitstaff needs to make a living and good service deserved 20% or more.   But this guy, which I swear is the owner, already cheated us on the food, did not deserve a tip.

Believe the one star reviews.  Don't come here.  I'm sure we all want to give zero star if we could.

See my other review of Sake2me in Dallas.  $19.95 all you can eat and the quality is 1,000 times better and cheaper than this crappy place Kabuto.
I'll need to go to Sake2me this weekend and get a sushi fix."}
{"text":"Disappointed with our latest visit. The servers were way under staffed, didn't get many basic things such as water and order was not correct. Chef didn't say a word the entire meal and didn't have any sauces available.  The steak was cooked good the only redeeming part of the meal and this review. Was here celebrating a birthday and they did not celebrate as requested early in night. According to others in party bathrooms were not well kept, no paper towels or dryer. We've had good experiences in past, hope they pull it together."}
{"text":"all I can say is WOW. From the moment I walked into the front door and until I left Kabutos, I felt like I was a part of the kabuto family. The hostess made me feel like I was arriving for christmas dinner. The chef we had was named mardel and he was simply amazing. His show was incredible and can not really be put into words, From the flipping of the knives to the volcano eruption was an experience that I think every american family should go see for themselves. The service was impeccable and the food was the best japanese food I have ever had in my 43 years. My drink was never empty, I had every sauce that they had offered to me. My dinner plates and dining area was always clean and the server name we had was John. The managers Aaron and megan came by my table to be personable and ask how the service- food was. That is something that many restaurants on the weekend, when busy never do anymore. I am simply astonished about the experience that me and my family had at Kabuto. I recomend this restaurant to anyone and everyone with a family, business meeting, or just among friends."}
{"text":"Awesome place for some fun an dinner bring the family leave happy and full. Food is great service is good. Watch out for the onion vulcano."}
{"text":"It really depends on who you chef is, but every time we go in we have a great time!  Wife had the chicken and I had the filet, both were very good.  I've read some people say it not the best they have had, but I don't think Kabuto tries to be upper class.  This is a casual steak house, as long as you know that going in, I think you will really enjoy it.  Go with as many people as you can, the more you have, the more fun you will have!"}
{"text":"LONG LIVE THE MT. FUJI ROLL!!!!

The Mt. Fuji Roll is just amazing!...seriously. Eating it is utopia like. It's very unique. A large tuna roll breaded w/ fried Panko topped w/ Masago. WOWZER! These bad boys are huge. 

Since this tuna roll was so unique, unlike any ever experienced, we asked the sushi chef about it. He said not many people know how to make such a roll & it's much more popular on a California & Japanese menu. 

Needless to say, I met my friend here on a Tuesday. While passing thru on Friday, I was right back again getting the same exact thing. The lunch special is also a huge savings! Walked outta there w/ these two Mac Daddy rolls for HALF the price. Hell yeah. 

In short-----The Mt. Fuji Roll & Tuna Dynamite Roll are absolutely beyond belief -----phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"What a horrible night! We had 7:30 reservations, didn't get seated until 8:00. We finally were done with dinner at 10:15. The Server was horrible, simple tasks of taking our order, providing silverware, filling waters seemed to be very difficult. The \"chef\" came out and did a great job and cooked a very good meal. It was delicious! Asked for our bill, it was jacked up. It had an additional (6) meals on it... It took 3 different people, 3 try's at getting the bill correct. Dinner was a horrible disaster! I do not suggest anyone go here. If your craving Japanese food, go to yoshis or sushi star and save your self a ton of money and still eat great food!"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite of ours. While the location and atmosphere aren't the greatest, the food is always up-to-par. In true hokey American style, the chefs' cooking routines are standard and unoriginal, but always provide laughs for our kids. You will always leave full as they pile up the food when you have the hibachi-style meals. The sushi is okay. I'd give this place 3-stars as a rating if my kids didn't love it so much...but they do."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! Great service, great food, fun Hibachi chef, etc!!! Delicious! Fun for the kids, too! They loved the entertainment!"}
{"text":"Cook was great! Food was good. I would have given them more stars, but the wait staff was average. We ordered sushi and finally after we were half done with dinner and we had yet to get any sushi I inquired where it was. I was told the sushi chef was also too busy and was tending bar. They just decided to take it off our bill.. at least that was ok."}
{"text":"We will not return to this restaurant. 

We thought that going to this hibachi restaurant would be a change of pace from our normal fine dining selections for restaurant week in the Charlotte area. Boy were we correct! 

Like responsible and considerate people, we made reservations a few weeks in advance. Our error was assuming that having a reservation would entitle us to being seated in a reasonable amount of time. Our party of five was seated at 8:20 for our 7:30 reservation. We started seeing our food prepared at around 9:30. 
The chef for our table was talented and entertaining. He was the bright spot for our evening. 

The social media manager told my wife that the terrible wait was due to snow the previous weekend, and it being restaurant week. I'm sorry, but that is unacceptable. There are ways to professionally manage reservations, even for a busy restaurant. It is accomplished successfully every day at hundreds of other restaurants. The hostess's line \"we are clearing tables right now\" to our exasperated party when we asked how much longer we had to wait was quite aggravating after group after group were seated in front of us. 

The terrible service in the front of the restaurant far outpaced the passable fare. I blame myself for allowing Kabuto to treat me this way and dampen our evening."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice in the last 3 weeks. The first time the food was better than when we went yesterday. So I think it's safe to say they have consistency issues. Also, there was a bug in the menu. Ew! That should've been our cue. We prefer to sit at the bar than get a table since we don't need the \"show\". At the bar you can see all the sushi being prepared. After seeing this, I would NEVER in a MILLION years get the sushi here. The fish doesn't look fresh and I'm not even sure the case is refrigerated since everything looks so dry. We probably won't be back. There has to be a better hibachi place in the area."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR $, service was extremely slow and they charge $11 for a Tito's & soda (very weak). Kids were going crazy by the end of the meal and bill was wrong, ridiculous experience."}
{"text":"Every negative review appears to be accurate. We honestly wanted to just have a quick tableside Japanese dinner and figured all the reviews couldn't be as bad as this place actually is. This place is worse!! Soup was like a light dirty water, wife's salad had so much dressing it was like a soup. Service was non existent, we went the whole meal without the waters we asked for 3 times.. waiter was Mia the whole meal.. the order of the food was even screwed up. It took forever between courses, and portions were tiny.. the dinner ended by the \"chef\" putting 3 pieces of broccoli and 2 mushrooms on my plate after the whole meal was over.. meal was $100 for 2 of us with sake and wine.. big waste"}
{"text":"Very entertaining chefs! Clean place to eat and hot food cooked right in front of you! Good experience for kids!"}
{"text":"You know yes the miso soup was like water but ..... When with the place packed and having to wait a little longer than expected with our group of 10 that had a reservationn- i am still giving this place 4 stars. Staff was super nice. Always came up to check on us.  Hibatchi  server was great-focused the 3 kids we had celebrating birthdays. Sushi i had was very good. Everyone seemed happy who ordered Hitachi. Total bill was actually not too high for group of 10!"}
{"text":"Let me start by every time I go to kabutos I have a terrible experience. If I could rate nothing I would. For starter they are ALWAYS under staffed. My mother did not want to sit in the corner and I understand they wanted to squeeze families together because they are understaffed. But when the manager allowed us to sit where we wanted to. She come back out being sarcastic saying \"please let this family feel comfortable while you sit with them.\" At that moment we just got up and left. The manager is the worst of them all. The plates were dirty and trust and believe when you go they still will be dirty and it's just dirty in there. I've been to McDonald's with way lower prices and a cleaner dining area. Over priced for the service and the scene. There is no wonder why the lights are dim in there ! They try to hid the fact of how disgusting it is in there. Honestly not going to anymore. This is not the only location with the same problems."}
{"text":"GO ANYWHERE ELSE. The service was the worst I've ever had in my life, I've never felt the need to leave a bad review prior to this nightmare. Our waiter was friendly but brutally honest, telling us that the salad was terrible after none of us were able to eat ours. The cleanliness of the restaurant was appalling, the chefs left a mess everywhere and the grill was patched with dirty tin foil along the edges. Dirty plates and silverware stayed on the tables for over 40 minutes. The food was barely edible, however after the surrounding experiences, I was too horrified to actually eat any of it. I requested to speak to management, and everyone there claimed none were on site, on a Friday night. Terrible experience and the staff seemed unphased, not surprised with our unhappiness and lacked any desire to actually improve the situation. Please spare yourselves and your family and DO NOT come here."}
{"text":"Way too expensive. Service was fine. I agree with previous reviews that I would not eat sushi here, it doesn't appear clean/fresh. Hibachi experience was fun with the group we went with. The soup was good. The edamame was not. Will not return."}
{"text":"AWFUL PLACE !!!!!!! I feel bad giving 1 star but the fact we just spent $100 for food that was ice cold and poor quality! We ordered spring rolls twice each time came back with ice inside. My husband order shrimp and steak and it was disgusting. The steak looked like the kind you would have with your eggs in the morning, very thin and rubbery. I was so upset I went to talk to the manager to wait 10 minutes (place was not busy) yet I gave up because I realized the negativity wasn't worth the wait. Despite the awful food the server was great!'"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Nice change. But need to go with friends. Angry couple may show up or can't stop talking woman. That's coming from a woman."}
{"text":"I have no idea what is causing over an hour wait to have our food even start to be cooked. It could be because it's the day after Christmas, they could be under staffed or they could just be this bad. BUT what upsets me the most is we walked in and asked to sit at the bar for a quick meal. The older gentleman said \"no its quicker at the table. Come\" so we hesitantly followed him and sat. WE HAVE WAITED AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE CHEF EVER CAME TO OUR TABLE. I ordered sushi .. have yet to see my roll. My wife got habachi vegetables. Over an hour later and I am writing this review Hungry, irritated and 100% certain i will never return here again."}
{"text":"Standard hibachi fare. Much cleaner (maybe a little newer) than most Japanese steakhouses. Your clothes will still smell when you leave, but you will definitely have a full belly. I'd put this on the 'better end' of many I've tried."}
{"text":"Horrible service and food! Reservations were made for 12 people, restaurant was short staffed, manager came out to our table on the phone! Food was terrible! Pad thai tasted like plastic...no flavor.  Hibachi was OK, chef was great, but the food was sub par and the service was even worse! The calamari appetizer looked like frozen fish sticks! Everything about this place was horrendous! 1 star is for the chef, Fu!"}
{"text":"Please do not waste your time or money coming here!  Service is slow and amateur.  Most are young kids who are not trained as servers.  Took over thirty minutes before chef ever came out.  Kids were going crazy waiting.

Kobe at the next exit up is nicer and has better service."}
{"text":"... food was perfect ... wait staff was perfect zzz only issue is what they put on the grill the smell made me want to ........ you dont want to know.  They need to have better ventilation.  I dont want to discredit the place but my head is throbbing and my food tasted slightly like the smell.   I couldn't do it again seemed like everyone else loved it and the smell didn't bother them"}
{"text":"This restaurant was an epic failure from beginning to end. 

To start, we had a reservation for 7:45 to celebrate a friends birthday. Admittedly, we were a large crowd, but that's why we chose hibachi and made a reservation. They seated us promptly at 9:00 and made no apologies for making us wait over an hour. 

Once we were sat, we waited at the table for about another 20 minutes before anyone even came to take our order. At this point, we were all hungry, thirsty and hot. Those hibachi grills put off a lot of heat. We spoke with management a number of times and they seemed unconcerned that no one was taking care of us. I thought that would change when 4 people got up and left, but no. 

By this point, it's after 9:30. Remember, our reservation was for 7:45. We had no water, no drinks, no waiter/waitress and hadn't so much as put in our order. Eventually, someone woke up and took our order. 

The chefs were standard, but the food was not memorable. I was just so hungry I didn't care about the food at that point. 

After dinner, we were ready to leave, but needed to pay. After notifying several servers that we needed to pay - which seemed to come as a surprise to them that we needed our bills - they all teamed up to give us our checks. Which were wrong. I had to actually go into the kitchen to get a waiter to recalculate my bill and watch him swipe my card. I didn't trust that they could figure it out without direction. 

Overall, the biggest disappointment is that this was a night to celebrate my friends birthday that was marred by an incompetent wait and management staff. I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Flavorless rice, noodles were spaghetti noodles, and food was cooked in an odd order. Someone in our group had a food allergy and had to remind and watch everything the cook did although he was aware of the allergy. Drinks were strong but tiny for the price. Sushi was good but again very expensive. Waitress was very sweet and attentive but had no clue what sushi was and even though we pointed at what we wanted she still didn't put the order in correctly because she clearly didn't know what any of it was. Three of us paid over $120 and it was mediocre at best. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE KABUTO. Admittely, its pretty ratchet. None of the forks or cups match, but like its fine. The food is awesome. Shoutout to Fernando who is 10/10 the best hibachi chef at the restaurant. Also, the old asian man, Patrick, is the SWEETEST person ever. The manager Megan is very rude though. For saying the restaurant is all about customer service, she could stand to be a little nicer. Overall though you should definitely eat here, but make a reservation because it helps a lot."}
{"text":"Our First time to this restaurant and lets say our last.  The place was understaffed for sure.  We seat with another group of 4 and they left because it was taking So long.  Our soup was cold and also our crab Wonton raps.  We had to ask several times for drinks and one person of the group that left never got his drink. When the chief Came to the table the order was so messed up we had to explain to him again what we got.  Then after we got done the manager came and had to retake our order to bill us.  The manager would not take any money off the bill for our cold food and such a long wait.  Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE AT THIS LOCATION ! The worst place to eat ever! I have been coming to this location for years and it was great until this year! The last 4 times I visited we've had the same cook who cooks the food out of order, doesn't add oil to any of the food while cooking. The cook also poured a whole lot of garlic powder on the food but no soy sauce. The veggies were burnt to a crisp! The whole meal pissed me off!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal last night.  The coldest beer I have had in a long time.  Enjoyed the standard Japanese Steak House menu, but they offer a lot more than most.  Service was good and all the employees we dealt with were freindly and happy to be there."}
{"text":"This dinner has taken 2 hours to complete; our drinks and water took 20 minutes to get to us after we sat down and gave our order which is unacceptable; our food took an additional hour to be started and made; and we had been sitting around waiting for our check for another 25 minutes. Our server let our drinks get empty multiple times and the staff was nowhere to be found. The prices are outrageous. The food was absolutely delicious and the chefs put on a nice show or else this would be a one star review."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a review of the actual food, but I didn't get that far. I called in a to-go order at lunch time and was told that my food would be ready in 15 mins. I showed up 15-20 minutes later and there was no hostess in the front when I walked in. I waited for 5 minutes and then walked toward the back bar...I could hear people in the back but no one was coming out. I yelled back there....nothing. I could hear them talking so I know they could hear me. The restaurant was empty except for one table (which no one came out to check on the whole time I was there). After 15 minutes of waiting and no help, I walked out. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I cannot claim it is the best japanese steakhouse I have been too but we left full and well entertained. I didn't like how the chef we had only gave us a partial show while the chef serving the other tables did the full blown show. It was my husbands birthday and I guess I expected at least what the other chefs were doing. The beer selections were limited to Asian (Comparable to Budweiser) Nothing great. The price was a bit high but compared to other places like this average."}
{"text":"Our experience was less than desirable. We call to make a reservation and after waiting an hour, we were told that they would need to seat the party after us because we made a call advance instead a reservation. What is the difference and why weren't we told that. We finally sat down, the crab wontons were cold, the lemon in the tap water had blood on it, the napkin had hair on it (no lie) and my son had white stuff on the inside of his cup. We sent the wontons back and they came back with 3 instead of 4 like the menu stated. The sushi came and it took 15 mins to get chopsticks and soy sauce. On the upside, vong our chef was a delight and made the night enjoyable. I would not recommend this place if you want fast service and warm food. If I could, they would get a negative star."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my time here! I had sushi and everything was excellent. I haven't tried the hibachi yet, but I'm sure I will at some point, that is if I can tear myself away from the sushi. Waitress was very attentive and made sure we were well taken care of the entire time we were there. I'll definitely be back to visit again, and would recommend Kabuto to anyone. Oh, and the cheesecake was delicious, a very nice surprise!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always great.   The cooks are great, and they are very clear about your order, always making sure they get it right.    I'm even a 'pain in the butt' customer because I always ask for light butter and no onions.   They always oblige."}
{"text":"Decent food, but overall this spot is a little dated. It's exactly what you'd expect; large group seating around the hibachi grill, dark lighting, and all of the hibachi tricks. You eat your meal in phases (unless you have the will power to wait until the end and eat it all at once). Once you've been to one Japanese steak house, you've kind of seen them all. Nothing was unique at Kabuto, but the food wasn't bad either. The service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"This was strange. Didn't know it was here and I won't be back. It's hibachi wannabe. I wouldn't recommend. Not worth the money. I got one of their higher priced specials for $27.95 thinking it might be better but no. Wait staff is not experienced, young kids. Food was not good and they have no ice cream for desert. No green tea ice cream??  For the noodles the don't use the traditional they used cheap spaghetti which was so bizarre! The soup was brown water with stuff that sunk to the bottom?  The salad had wilted and rotten lettuce. There wasn't anything that was quality and they make this sauce they give you for the shrimp I have never seen in a hibachi place before.  They pour it out on an old plastic pitcher that they obviously don't clean. The sauce was dripping all over the side- disgusting!   Nothing had flavor even the fake fried rice was a weird color and was just rice no veggies or scallions. Water was even nasty tasting.  

Update within 30 minutes of eating I got very sick. Actually started feeling sick before I even left. Went in the bathroom the toilet seats were so old that the top surface was gone. How expensive are toilet seats?! The stall doors and goo and who knows what all over them, It was filthy!  Thank goodness I live close I ran home and was violently ill all night. These 5 star ratings must be owners, friends and employees cause this place doesn't deserve even one star. Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying this has been my favorite spot to attend on birthdays or any special occasion for my family. I went for lunch this past Sunday and horrible is an understatement. I went to the rude host/waiter and told them I didn't want a specific cook, but was told there was only 1 cook during lunch which exactly who we didn't want. I stayed to give the guy a chance but....shrimp was raw, rice was hard and wasn't seasoned, vegetables were burnt because the cook didn't use any oil or butter on anything. The whole meal was just horrible, and the rude host/waiter which I believe is the owner still expect me to pay for the meals. NOT. I will not be going back to this location ever again. Food is horrible and customer service is at an all time LOW!!! Not going to spend money where I'm not appreciated as a customer and receive horrible service!!!"}
{"text":"Just terrible. Noodles oily with garlic powder. Rice had no flavor. Two of us were done eating before others were even served. Gave us mushrooms last after we were all done. Ridiculous. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero point for this restaurant. If you don't want to waste your money, don't ever go there."}
{"text":"I created a Yelp account just to review this restaurant in hopes I can spare others from the horrible experience we had. But our experience was nothing new; based on the other reviews it is typical and the same issues have been going on for years. Ownership obviously does not care.  I wanted to contact them but the contact information is not listed on their website. What does that tell you? 

We had reservations at 6:30 for a party of 16 on a busy Saturday night. Our table was not ready until 7:30 but we were not in a hurry. Our waitress, who was very pleasant, had been working there for less than a week and it soon become obvious she was overwhelmed and in the weeds. Throughout our 3 1/2 hour experience she handled multiple tables on her own with zero help. This created a variety of problems. Our drinks were slow to arrive, or did not arrive at all. Several people in our party never got the drink they ordered and many of us had to share  drinks/water with someone else because we had nothing to drink, even after multiple requests. Two people in our party ordered sushi for dinner and it never came. We ordered other sushi appetizers and they never came (even though they tried to charge us for them). The soup bowls were never cleared. The salad bowls were never cleared. Other servers would walk by without glancing in our direction or ignoring our pleas for help. We brought a cake with us to celebrate a birthday but opted to take it home so we could get out of there. 

The food was OK; clear flavorless soup, bagged salad, and veggies and meats cooked in lots of oil/butter. But I don't come to these places for the food, I come for the experience. And our experience was terrible. The bathrooms were dirty, the surface areas were sticky and glassware/silverware was not clean. Run, don't walk, away from this place!!!"}
{"text":"I always love going here because you can get entertained and stuffed for the amount of money you spend. The hibachi is really good, especially if you like smothering it with shrimp sauce and rice. Fun times."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Took my girlfriend out for our 1 year anniversary and thought this place would be perfect. We were wrong, let's start with the 20 minute wait to just be seated then had to wait again for people to fill our table. When the food finally came out they got it wrong and we got a smaller portion of the item we payed for when it finnaly did come out. Then our server Macie messed up our order yet again by charging us for other people's drinks. Needless to say we will not be coming back"}
{"text":"The food was good but I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4 because of the entertainment factor.

At a Japanese steakhouse, I expect to be entertained by the chef but I heard more fun at other tables than ours.  He seemed like a young guy and maybe not as experienced but he knew how to cook just needs to work on the entertainment.

The Teriyaki Chicken (with mushrooms) was wonderful.  Broccoli would have been a nice addition to the veggies which only include zucchini and onions.  The meal was also served with both noodles and rice.

Oh yeah, the Raspberry sake martini was pretty tasty too.

A few nice touches were the free appetizers provided by the manager (Megan) I assume because we were part of a dinner group and she stopped by to tell us about the upcoming sushi making class and some changes to the menu.  That was very much appreciated!

I'll have to return to see if the entertainment factor improves."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today, shrimp is delicious! Prices are a bit high for lunch as they fill your plate with a ton of rice and garlic noodles $16. You can opt out of the sides as well for $9 they are so friendly too!"}
{"text":"Time for family holiday dinner 
You know the routine. You all sit at a big table around the center hot top
Every thing is cooked in front of you
Sliced small and served to your plate
I'm not a fan. No real service and boring predictable items 
The kids love it and that's why we go
Tonight the wine took forever and the cook had trouble with our orders 
Because of the family I'll have to go back but this is not my choice"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and I think yesterday was the last time. For the past year+ this place has been getting worse and worse! One waitress for 4 tables is a joke. Appetizer came out last. 20 min to get water. \"Medium\" steak was cooked for 10 minutes. New cooks need training. This place is caving and is NOT worth the time or money.  Go elsewhere or get Chinese next door at House of Taipei!"}
{"text":"This is hard for me because my love for this style of food started here years ago. By no means is this place the same as it was. Worst experiance ever at a place like this. Sanitation was at a 90 forgot my sushi for 40 min then it came out wrong. Left off all extra things me and my wife ordered as well as blew it off when i told them. If your going to spend 80 dollars a couple there are far better choices then this rip off. It also seems the portion of rice and noodles have shrunken by about half just felt cheated by the whole experience as well as age discriminated."}
{"text":"Ugh. Talk about disappointing. We were between this and Kobe. I can't guarantee Kobe is better but this was pretty rough. We got to our 6:15 reservation for 8 people early so we could get drinks first. Except the host was also the bartender. While we waited, we observed the almost empty sushi bar. Empty of people. Almost empty of old, previously frozen \"sushi\" fish. 

When we finally got our drinks, mixed drinks, they were more mixed then they were drinks. For $10 I expect them to go all out. Some fruit, juice and good liquor. Not pre mixed.  They were seriously in the glasses we have at home. NOT kidding. 

At out table. I asked the server about the Boneless spare ribs special. She openly admitted that she had no clue and she would never order them. She asked another server and she said she thinks they are good. People order them a lot and don't send them back?  Great. We asked for chopsticks and ordered our food. 

Drinks were empty. Chopsticks were so cheap they broke crooked and splintered our lips. Appetizers never came. Salads came well into out meal. The \"soup\" was just broth. No Miso. No mushroom. Just clear broth. The food itself was actually good. They only gave one sauce. We had to ask for a ginger sauce but it wasn't bad. Pretty salty but ok. The veggies only include zucchini and onion. The fried rice only included rice and egg. But it was all flavored well. It was hibachi.  Having Hibachi is a lot like sex. Even bad Hibachi is still Hibachi. What makes it good is the other stuff. The service. The drinks. The flair. There was no flair. None of the tables clapped or lagged for their chef. None of the chef's threw food for the guests to catch. Just meh. 

As someone who's worked for years in the restaurant industry, I could tell that they were cutting corners. That's fine if you are paying $10 per plate but for $25 per plate a cheap wine list, and $2.50 for a kids milk, it was sad. Even the forks at each seat were cheap. We almost turned around when we saw the sign on the door that said \"to conserve energy they were keeping the heat up\".  Oh well. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"We (a party of 12) had reservations for 5:30pm on a Saturday night. The waitress was prompt with taking our orders and refilling water glasses. Drinks (beers) from the bar took at least 10 mins to arrive. Each course came in good succession. The cook was lively and the food was tasty. We will return!"}
{"text":"Tried during restaurant week. Blandest food, although quality was pretty good. Service was really good. Got the extra star because of that."}
{"text":"This place should have a higher rating than it does. If the service was better then it probably would have 5 stars. That's our only complaint, is sometimes the service is slow. But the food outweighs that. A place that gives rice AND noodles, and cooks steak perfectly, is great in my book! One of our favorite restaurants for sure."}
{"text":"Decent place for a dining / entertainment evening.  Staff is friendly, food is standard table-top, flying shrimp and onion volcano \"Japanese\" fare.  Decent price point.  

BE CAREFUL regarding drinking and impaired driving.  This area off Exit 25 is REGULARLY PATROLLED by law enforcement. . .whom though very nice wil cuff & stuff you in suspected of DWI DUI."}
{"text":"We come here on a monthly basis but the last several times have been extremely irritating. Don't get me wrong, we keep coming back because the food is great, but I can't stand the fact that they try and cram more and more people around one cooking station. Years ago, one cooking station would seat 8 comfortably. As I'm writing this, I'm sitting with 8 adults and 3 children under the age of 7. It makes the entire experience unenjoyable. Currently considering Kobe as our new place...

*update* we have now been sitting at the table for an hour and no cook has arrived."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was atrocious. We waited for an hour to have our drink orders filled. Our reservations were at seven, it is now nine o'clock and we haven't gotten our dessert yet. It took an hour to get our drink orders. At our table, several customers had their orders forgotten. Chicken, steak, and salmon was left off of orders.  The food was delicious, and our chef very good. It just took him an hour to get to our table."}
{"text":"The food was very good and plentiful. I've yet to see a steakhouse where you get a veggies side with rice and lo mein noodles as well. Our chef was personable and fast. The problems we experienced were service telated. We ordered some sushi, but they told us the chef was behind and ultimately we never got our sushi.  I had ordered the 14ox sirloin. When the chef cooked it, he gave a serving to a guy who didn't order it, leaving me with only a 7oz portion. I assumed he'd grab another sirloin but he never did. I'd go back for the food but I would pay much closer attention to my order and the bill next time."}
{"text":"Very good. We have usually gone to the place in Cornelius but this place was much better. The only think I still do not like is the way they serve you spaghetti as noodles. I will-never understand that. How expensive can doodles be?  We had a nice young man who was out server and he was very pleasant.  . The food was very tasty and loved the yelp bonus"}
{"text":"Saw a banner saying they have a Sunday brunch, so figured why not.  party of 6 and we were the only ones in the restaurant.  after reading a few of the reviews, I was starting to feel a little hesitation.  I am very glad we decided to go.
I had the hibachi sirloin.  came with the usual- a nice hot soup and a nice bowl of chilled salad with ginger dressing.
We werent sure if the brunch was just table service or the entire show, but it was indeed the cooking show!  Our cook was a really friendly gentleman from Vietnam.  The kids were really entertained.  
Our server, \"Bear\", was right on top of everything.  Portions were great and we all left stuffed.  I recommend it!  
Out of the 6 of us, no complaints on the portions.  Scallops were cooked perfectly as was the shrimp."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my family for dinner. They were horribly understaffed and couldn't accommodate their customers, which they did not warn us about. Said the wait would be 20 mins. It was about 20-30 for a table - not far off from the estimate. However, once we sat down it took them about 20 mins to take our order, and over an hour before a chef came over. All in all it was TWO HOURS before our dinner started being cooked and was a THREE HOUR dinner total. Again, this would have been fine with warning or compensation, neither of which were offered. They didn't even comp our drinks (all non-alcoholic, so literally the least they could do to instill good will). In addition, since they were understaffed, they had no sushi or hot sake - again, no warning about this either. Everyone in the restaurant complained about the exceptionally poor service, still it was never addressed.

To top it all off, the hibachi dinner was extremely mediocre - definitely not worth all the trouble and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Bad service. SLOW.  The rice was horrible they took white rice put an egg in it and some soy and call it Japanese Fried Rice.  Never be back."}
