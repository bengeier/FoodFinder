{"text":"First experience.  My husband picked up food.  First thing I noticed was the long black hair in my burger.  What a waste of time and money.  My dinner is now in the trash.  My husband was braver then me and decided to taste the food.   He said the burger was disgusting, the jalapeno poppers were strange with cheddar cheese, and the mozzarella sticks were a step below the frozen no-name brand.  I wasn't missing out on anything except for maybe the stomach ache in his near future.  Lucky he only ventured to eat a bite of each!  Shame on you for serving such garbage!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour for breakfast and there were only 9 tables full. The smoke detector beeped the entire time. The should really consider hiring a good manager, a table waitress and loosing the order counter, it has the potential to go from fast food to a decent lil diner."}
{"text":"So I got the $9 Cobb salad. Poor ingredients for sure. Mushy veggies and over cooked eggs. Small portion as well. I got vinegar and oil for dressing. Once again the vinegar was substandard and the oil was a blend 5% olive oil and 95% soy no other options available. For the same price go up the street to Oregano's and get an epic salad and not this poor sad salad. You'll thank me later when your eating one of the best salads ever. This place is NOT four stars. Major misrepresentation."}
{"text":"So far I have been here twice and each time they exceeded expectations. 

Make sure you try their California Burger! Very fresh and goes well with their crispy fries."}
{"text":"Saw all the good reviews and had to give it a try. Sorry folks, not impressed. Ordered on Saturday am around 11:35. Counter girl didn't make me feel welcome, Next. Ordered double cheeseburger, fries and soda. They brought my food and I tried the fries which were warm, but soggy.  I put catsup on and my first bite was very bitter. Not sure if it was the catsup or the fryer oil on fries. Didn't like burger at all. One paddy was broke in half, kinda wierd. No flavor at all. For the money I spent, I should have gone to McDonalds and gotten the Grand Mac meal and received several dollars back. Plus a ice cream dessert. Very disappointed.
Kind of unsanitary with food on floor and by garbage containers and ice on floor by soda machine. Not safe at all. Manager needs to train staff that when they deliver food, and one, they need to pick up floor or comeback with something in their hands otherwise you're wasting a trip. Just another greeeasy spoon to me."}
{"text":"Was driving by and thought let's try something new. They have a huge digital menu that includes breakfast lunch and dinner. I tried the California burger single patty with Sweet potato fries. It only took about 5 minutes before my husband and I had our food. It taste great only problem was I said no bacon and it was still on my sandwich. Otherwise great service and good food. I will be back to try the Cinnamon French toast"}
{"text":"We love this place! I have no complaints whatsoever. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The food was great with big portions. They also have breakfast all day which is a big plus in my opinion. I would highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"great food! service is slow especially weekends.. wasn't to happy about paying extra for seasoning salt on my fries and tiny yellow peppers! but overall 7.5 out of 10 would be a 10 in exception to lil charges and slow service.... okay quick update I've been back a few times since the nickel n dimeing ordeal.
Ordered me uh 1st base  that comes with onions! I asked for grilled onions & to my surprise they said that'll be .50cent extra..ARE YOU KIDDING ME REALLY? FORGET ABOUT YOUR CLIENTELE ..got give it uh 6.5"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once and will not return.  Food was subpar at best; chicken strips/fried shrimp were overcooked, hamburger patty appeared to be of the frozen variety (I would expect with burger in your name that your patties would be fresh/homemade).

 They were out of corndogs and also bananas (for their advertised banana milkshake). I opted for the chocolate milkshake which ended up being a big mistake.  It looked disgusting and it tasted even worse."}
{"text":"We stopped by late on a weekday night and got breakfast. We were surprised how nice the atmosphere was the food was great. We went a second time on a Sunday during the day and had lunch. I couldn't eat it all and it was good. It is a great place to get breakfast, lunch or dinner and they have a very big menu. I would recommend."}
{"text":"We were just looking for a burger place when we saw the Sammy's burgers sign & decided to try it & O.M.G.!! we were so glad we did! The burgers are amazingly delicious. The fries were fresh & hot. The staff was so friendly & helpful. I live in south phoenix & was just on that side of town for a festival at the Goodyear ballpark, but i would definitively the 18 miles to eat here again. They also have breakfast, hot dogs & chkn strips. The man next to me had a chili dog & mam it looked  yummy. I wanted to take a bite, lol!! if you're in the area & haven't tried Sammy's burgers yet, you should, soon!"}
{"text":"For those from SoCal used to the \"around the corner,everything on the menu,greasy-spoon\" spot...this will take you home.You can get good quality food from burgers to wings pastrami sandwiches breakfast burritos...ect.All of which are good tasting.The surprise is probably the broasted chicken.Very good and worth the drive over if you live in the Avondale Goodyear Litchfield part of town."}
{"text":"I went here during a Lunch break on work... It's a family owned place I enjoyed the friendly conversation great customer service and the Food was great reminded me of the Food I use to have in Hawaii. I have been all over the world and tasted many different flavor profiles.... This was a great stop and i have been recommending it to all my Friends teriyaki burger was great.... Their steak sandwich is awesome and they have the Biggest wings I may have ever tried so I definitely recommend this if you want that good Mom n Pop kind of food much better then these Chain places hope this was helpful enjoy your food everyone."}
{"text":"Tuna melt not bad it was cold in the middle but tasty the burger was just average nothing special. But the fries were amazing. Big selection to chose from. Nice place clean and friendly check it out."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd attempt at Sammys \"Burgers\".
 Service is friendly. Over priced for a burgers thinner than a McDonald's hamburger. How can you call yourself a burger place and have a less than mediocre burger??? I order the \"curveball burger\" they curved me on meat. The tomato is cut thicker than my actual burger patty. Don't waste your money on a burger here. There's a jack n box across the street with a better, thicker burger at 1/2 the price, sadly"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The portions are so big and filling. So many great options on the menu, breakfast lunch and dinner. I always get a burger, and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good mom and pop restaurant, I've had the burgers which are good but I go primarily for breakfast. Let me start of by saying the breakfast is always consistent goodness, was a fan of hash browns until I had the home fries...FANTASTIC!  I really appreciate the GREAT customer service, and this is why I will keep returning again and again...I see you Sammy, strong work!"}
{"text":"Being originally from California and eating at local burger joints where they add shredded lettuce and thousand island dressing on your burger is a must- this place hits pretty close to home. We are regulars at Sammy's. I love the big classic burgers and fat French fries. We've ordered a few burgers here. Classic hamburger, cheeseburger, hatch burger and the mushroom burger. All are delicious! The establishment is always clean. They have juices and chocolate milks for the little ones which is a plus. I'm glad that I've found a family owned restaurant with a nice staff and good food. The owners are from California as well and very nice folks. Want a good burger just step into Sammy's. They also have a big breakfast menu and fish fry Friday! Enjoy!

**UPDATE** 
As much as I love Sammy's when you're charging your customers $2.99 for a 16oz chocolate milk for your kids- That's a little insane. Maybe $1.99 but $2.99 cmon. Also if someone would like to add \"onions,\" onions which go bad right? For $.50 extra, I don'k know that seems a a little too extra for onions. I don't mind paying $.50 extra for ranch but definitely not for onions. Lol. I hope they don't start raising their prices on petty things because folks with start to notice and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place for my burger fix. Glad to have this place near home and a place to take kids. All food has flavor and never disappointed when we est there. Employees always nice and service fast. You will not leave hungry. California double cheese w onion rings is my favorite."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast & lunch the next day. Decent menu for both meals. Burgers were juicy & well seasoned. Fish & Chips was delicious, chili cheese fries are legit. We'll be back to this place in the future. Five stars if they would fix up some of the dining booths, as they had holes in them."}
{"text":"Sammy's Burgers are delicious and a great addition to Goodyear! I've seen the place while driving by but never thought anything much because this specific location has been taken over by so many different businesses over the years I didn't want to get my heart set on the spot and then see it go. To hear that Sammy's has been here for three years brings comfort knowing they will be here to stay (fingers crossed). I decided to give it a try after reviewing all the great yelp reviews instead of just going to another fast food joint. I am so glad that I did. I had a hamburger with french fries and a drink. May I mention our order was pick up and still tasted great when we ate at home. The amount of French fries served was extremely generous. We had so much left over that we threw them in the oven the next day for dinner. The hamburger patty itself tasted grilled fresh and not a run of the mill kind which sets them apart. Definitely, on my list now for a good burger but, that's not all that's served here. They have a breakfast menu and Fish Friday's. I will be trying out more of what Sammy's has to offer."}
{"text":"Came here with my family you can tell it's a new place one customer had a messed up order but they fixed it right away. Our food came out semi fast and was good. The fries were decent and the burger was good. I wouldn't call it my favorite burger place but I do love how they give plenty of food choices and will come back to try the other kinds of food they have"}
{"text":"I love support local, independent places and I've had good experiences here before but the service was realllllly slow. With two small kids, this was really hard and we almost walked out. The chicken and waffles was good as was the omelette but the kids Mac n cheese was just Kraft and not worth the price or the wait. I'll come back but maybe not on a weekend morning for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wife and I had the all you can eat fish and it was very good. Will definitely be back to try more on the menu.

The all you can eat isn't a good deal unless you're going to eat a bunch. I ate 5 pieces of fish which cost $9.99 for the AYCE but it would have been a dollar cheaper if I would have ordered the 5 piece meal instead. My wife only ate 3 pieces which would have been $3 cheaper if she ordered the 3 piece meal. That is our fault for not figuring that out ahead of time. Would have also liked if the fries were all you can eat as well.

Regardless, food and service were good. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great menu ! This will be a regular..... Finally a good breakfast at reasonable prices. Not to mention a great burger and Friday's \"all you can eat fish\". Thank you for setting up shop in Goodyear. See you soon."}
{"text":"We've been waiting to try this new place. Walked in an was immediately feeling good vibes. Place was clean and somewhat busy. They had a huge menu that looked overwhelming...:)) Service was great with only 2 girls working, tables needed to be clean, but we could see that they knew and were trying to make their way to cleaning them as soon as they could. We ordered and didn't wait too long to get our food. I had the bacon cheeseburger with chili cheese fries, which were both tasteless. However, my husbands food was the best, fried chicken with coleslaw. Was so good I had to take one of his 4 pieces for myself. Definitely coming back for more of their fried chicken."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner when ordering I asked the guy at the counter what was on the teriyaki burger, I told him to remove the tomato and onion. Once we received our food my burger had mushrooms. I went to the counter and told the two girls the guy didn't mention it had mushrooms and the one girls response was \"sorry\" I looked at her puzzled and walked back to my seat. Discussing with husband how bad the service was and how we should handle it I went back up to the counter. The guy who i ordered with and the lady were there at that point, I told him he failed to mention the teriyaki burger had mushrooms and he apologized, I then at that point asked if they could remake my burger because I wouldn't eat it with mushrooms she looked at me and said yes.. I asked her if she was the manager and she said she was the owner.... I was amazed that the owner whom I spoke to at first didn't offer to fix a mistake on my food immediately.
Bad customer service and I won't be back"}
{"text":"I thought the food was really good and salad was fresh.  I ordered the 3 piece fish and the husband ordered the Denver Omelette.  He was not too impressed with the eggs.  The eggs were overcooked and the stuff inside was caramelized before being added to the omelette.  We stopped in about 9pm, so the breakfast cook had left earlier in the day...

Place was clean and waitress at the counter was very nice."}
{"text":"The quality of food was sub standard. Someone left the phone and i could see the staff not care about it. Worst experience, worst waiter services, bad food, no manner to talk to client. Manager is irresponsible. Bad experience."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is amazing, from friendly service to quality of food. We live in Glendale but were in the area so we decided to stop by. Food was just hands down great; my wife had Hatch green chile burger and my son had Gluten Free burger, (yes they even have GF buns) I ordered double cheese burger with green chile and sweet potato fries. All of us loved our burgers. Even though they open few weeks ago this place is booming. Not surprised, give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"AMAZING BURGERS great customer service. Love he family dinner feel, food was great seasoning wise and hot. 

For sure coming back!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!! Their staff and cooks do not follow the health code!

My father went in to try this place out, ordered, and saw the cook scratching his face and then proceeded to scratch his private area. Are you kidding me? How disgusting! The manager in charge refused to believe her own employee was doing that. Thank God we got our refund, definitely not recommending anyone here unless you want to get sick. If you care about your family do not go here, you're in for a disgusting scene within the kitchen."}
{"text":"Awesome food. It reminds of the burgers spots from East LA. I love the pastrami and the philly steak is out of this world."}
{"text":"We live in the area and were reluctant to try it but, our neighbors said they'd been there 4-5 times already.  We also noticed there's a good bit of traffic at this place & it just opened 5 weeks ago, so we took a rare leap of faith weren't disappointed. The decor is like a true neighborhood restaurant. It was a Sunday during late brunch and the place was buzzing. Cheyenne was AMAZING!!! She provided outstanding service from beginning to end in a time where customer service is a lost art form. The food portions were huge and tasty. I've now tried the ginormous 4 egg build you own omelette twice and I'm a fan. The broiler chicken and waffles a home run. My biggest gripe is that I can eat more things because everything is great. This isn't a place to calorie count and it's very family oriented. All food is hot, fresh and made to order. If you're in the area don't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place is basically Burger King with a different name. Food was ok. Service was terrible. Not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Omg this was great.  We are transplants from California and really missed this type of food.  My husband had the western breakfast bowl. It had eggs, potatoes, bacon,cheese and gravy.  It was so good we could not stop eating it.  I had the California burger which was perfect and exactly what I order when ever i get to a burger place like this. It had lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, avocado and thousand island dressing. It was perfect! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Worst burger I have ever had. First I repeated my order was to go, and was also asked \" this is to go right\"... I ordered a simple cheeseburger, fry and drink. While I waited for my order the lady brings out a cheeseburger and asked if I had ordered one. I replied \"yes to go\". Then seconds later my order was called which was dumped into a to go container. Meat was dry, 1000 island was soaked in as if nothing put on, didn't have tomato or pickle. To top it off the bun was 2 bottoms. Not worth it won't be back."}
{"text":"Sammys is a great place to eat friendly staff great food. They also have a fantastic breakfast this morning I had ham and eggs so much food would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I come here often. Sure I read the reviews and maybe a very few selected will think I'm crazy for trying this, but I'm glad I did. It is DELICIOUS every time. I have never had an issue. I would recommend it. If it is not your taste there is no need to bad mouth the place. Especially behind a keyboard. Great job Sammy's."}
{"text":"In an effort to try a new local spot, my son and I tried Sammy's Burger. I ordered an egg scramble bowl and he ordered a chicken fried steak, we shared a side biscuit/gravy. All was great. Large portions served. Ordered at the counter, staff was nice and bright/smiling. She assisted us with ordering as it was our first time. As we waited for our food at a table there were plenty of apparent \"regulars\" as we observed her laughing and \"haven't seen you in a while\" conversations. My teenage son actually commented on how nice everyone seemed. It was on a Saturday morning around 9AM. The crowd was constant but not overcrowded and certainly no complaints. We are eager to try more items on the menu - one being their version of chicken and waffles - and bring the rest of our family to try/weigh in. Will update review once more has been tried."}
{"text":"Sammy's has excellent all you can eat fried cod on Fridays. Seriously best we've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place twice, first for breakfast, ok not stellar.  French toast tasted like it had been marinated in some type of sugar.  WAY too much!!  Biscuits & gravy made with a powder & frozen biscuits??? Rest was ok. 
Asked about fish fry & burgers.  Were told they were good.  Asked if fresh or frozen patties.  Were told fresh.
Came back to try the burgers.  Totally frozen patties.  What?  Same waitress asked how we liked them, worst burgers ever.  Why name it Sammy's Burgers if your going to buy small thin pathetic frozen patties. Why lie?  Not coming back, no one is cooking anything at this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some breakfast and it was Nice Big portions really fresh and good Chorizo omelette was delicious you gotta get it with green child and bell peppers and pancakes nice and fluffy just how I like them hash browns crispy and so was the bacon too. Awesome place KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the pastrami burger. It was a frozen hamburger patty.  Very little pastrami. The bun was twice as big as the patty pastrami was even less.  Burger had no flavor no salt no pepper couldn't taste any any flavor. 
When it was the Burger Joint they used FRESH ground BEEF. 
Had breakfast there yesterday. The biscuit was frozen the gravy was from powder and doctored. Home fries were nasty. The omelette was huge and was great. 
Overall tried twice won't go back."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place,
Was in the area, on our way home. Wanted to stop for lunch before wife had to work. Yelped the area for a burger joint and Sammy's comes up. I ordered the pastrami burger, wife had her cheeseburger. We also shared a strawberry shake. 
First of all I have to say the shake was awesome. Probably the best part of the meal. The pastrami burger was OK. The reason why it was just OK. It was my first Pastrami burger. Wasn't sure how thus was going to be? Next time I will try the green chili burger. Wife thought her cheeseburger was really good. Fries came out super hot and crispy. Have no complaints for this establishment. If in the area again, we will have to stop by again.
Service was super fast, and the workers were really nice. GREAT PLACE!"}
{"text":"If you like broasted chicken, this place is outstanding. So happy that I live nearby!"}
{"text":"It was okay. Burger was bland, bun wasn't soft. Definitely now the best burger I ever had. Overpriced for sure. I think I prefer In n out over this place."}
{"text":"One if the best burgers within 10 mile radius you gotta try this place excellent so at least yourself a favor and give him a try"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I have had a good chili cheeseburger. I have finally found one west of the Mississippi. 
The staff very friendly and fast service. Love it will be back
You need to check out Sammy's"}
{"text":"Place okay just a Lil buger joint ordered the bacon burger wasn't out of this world good, but a Lil over priced for a what they offer but customer service was good and place was clean"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a great burger place that's open late.  We stumbled across Sammy's today and have found much more than a great burger place!   They have a wide ranging menu which includes breakfast all day, burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, chicken, fish, and more.  The staff is very attentive and the place is very clean.

We ordered the country breakfast bowl and the tuna salad to eat there.  We took home burgers and fries for the hungry crew that didn't go with us.   The portion size on the breakfast bowl and the tuna salad was huge.  We both barely could eat half and brought the rest home.  

I've got nothing bad to say at all about this little hidden gem.   I can't wait to go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Nice mom and pop burger joint in Goodyear. Stopped by with the family and had a good experience. The staff (young lady behind counter) was very helpful and explained menu to us. She even provided recommended items which was very helpful. The inside of the restaurant was comfortable and had a couple of televisions. Nice decor that I provided a picture of. For the food, my wife and I tried the burger with thousand island (forgot the name) and it was tasty. Wished for a little more sauce but that's being picky. The fries were awesome. Did have to drop .50 for ranch which did seem a little high but it was good. Lastly, daughter knocked out the banana shake and we both enjoyed it :). Overall, a good mom and pop spot that I hope lasts in Goodyear."}
{"text":"I love eating breakfast lunch and dinner here. Their food is so delicious. The staff is very friendly. Except sometimes if you get breakfast they don't bring you syrup. They tell you to walk over across the dining room and get it yourself. Mustard too!"}
{"text":"I LOVED THIS PLACE! I got the California burger and it was a good size. The staff is friendly and the place is really clean. The price is great for the quality. I highly recommend this place to go eat. It's small and very relaxed. Great for lunch or dinner. It was my first time and I will be going back for sure !"}
{"text":"The place is pretty good had a First Base and a Second Base combo Special! Nice place to eat at very good service they care about what they do. The lady at the front explained almost every burger to me which was nice. Can't wait to try something else like there breakfast."}
{"text":"Very greasy food, fries tastes gross and my fish was marinated in grease. No thank you. ..."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best burgers ever. I got the California burger (I think that's the name) and it was perfectly cooked and yummy! The fires and onion rings were fabulous too. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The best breakfast burritos!!!! I love this place they are do fast and the food is always so fresh. My parents come from California and they always want to eat their breakfast burritos. I had other food their it was great!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Positives:
This is a nice mom and pop burger joint in Goodyear.  My family enjoys going here. It's nice and clean on the inside and plenty of seating.  The only reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because I'm comparing to other burger places such as paradise valley burger and rocket burger, which are both amazing. I try to compare apples to apples. 

I would suggest ordering double pattys on your burger.  I don't get the sauce since I don't care for thousand island dressing.  They give you tons of fresh frys and they are yummy!! Try their banana shake. 

Negatives:
I don't really have anything negative to say.. Nice place I hope Goodyear keeps it.  I'd double the meat if you like a thicker burger."}
{"text":"Burgers done right! We were looking for a casual restaurant and thanks to yelp! we found this gem. Three of us, three different burgers. Friends had a California burger and bacon cheeseburger. I had the hatch burger. Delicious! Cooked to perfection and a side of fries made the meal. Fresh brewed unsweetened iced tea -seriously, needed extra ice, it was that fresh. Friendly staff, quick service and reasonable prices. This East Valley gal will be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and every time the food quick, correct and always tasty. Combined with the outstanding customer service and friendly staff, it's a place I'll continue to eat."}
{"text":"Not much here to brag about. The burger meat was bland not even S/P. Bun was stale fell apart similar to frozen or old buns. For $9 I wont return."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times and it never disappoints. It reminds me of one of my favorite burger spots back in Anaheim, CA where we would watch Angel games.  The pastrami burger and chicken strips are bomb as well as their fries. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We love this place! We're from California and are used to cali style burgers, this place sure does cali style right! The breakfast is delicious all the time and the French toast is our favorite!"}
{"text":"Best philly in town!!! Will be coming back for more and friendliest staff! Great prices."}
{"text":"If I can give zero stars I would! So to start the girls running the registers were unwelcoming. I ordered the shrimp platter that is shown on the menu. Clearly it's a picture of butterfly breaded shrimp. I asked clearly if the jumbo shrimp that I ordered was that shown on the picture which she stated \"yes\" immediately. Assuming she knows what is shown the menu of their own job. But when I received it, the shrimp was battered shrimp! Not butterfly shrimp! So I decided to go ahead and try it. First bite was the worst decision I've ever made in my life. 1) the shrimp had the poop in it still (not cleaned) 2) it tasted weird, not like shrimp would taste like). I immediately spit what was left of the bite and told them to change it to just a salad, since it left a bad taste in my mouth. Which the cashier was bothered to do. To top it off, I started getting stomach pain and a sick feeling 30mins later! Thank goodness I did not eat what could have being food poisoning!"}
{"text":"Nice local place with a large variety of menu choices.  Family owned with a friendly staff.  The fish and chips is excellent, and the burgers are very good.  The chicken strips are ok, but be aware they're really heavily breaded.  One of the few places in the area with really good fried zucchini.  They also serve breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Got a turkey burger and it was so tasty. Delicious! Fries were super fresh. The size of the burgers are great too. Really you won't regret it. Definitely recommend Sammy's. They know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Right from the beginning I got a bad taste in my mouth. Waited at the front counter (I was the only person in there besides 2 parties already seated) for a few minutes until someone decides to come out and help me. I ordered ahead mind you, and my total was $21. A California burger, small sweet potatoes fries and a double bacon cheese burger entree. The burger was average and the fries was undercooked. Do no recommend this place at all. Not worth the money or the below average service."}
{"text":"Where they go wrong is calling it a burger place. It is more of a diner with above average burgers. I can tell that someone put their love into this place and had dreams of being a hit burger place. It was good for \"I am starving and need food right now and I don't care what it is\" moment but honestly next time I will go to Red Robin."}
{"text":"Great little place to eat!! Ate burger and fries and they were so good and fresh! My husband even messed up my order and I realized it after I bit into the burger already. We asked if there was anyway to get a new burger and the made me a brand new one. That's customer service!! Definitely come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is really good and the price is spot on. Would differntly recommend to everyone to Try it once."}
{"text":"Gross.  

I feel bad for people who think this is good food.  I get that Goodyear has almost no option for good food that is quick service but it doesn't mean that us Goodyear residents need to settle for this crap.  

Fries were so bland and the oil it was fried in was obviously very old!  I tasted the oil more than the fries.  

The burgers were incredibly thin and obviously not fresh.  Not even sure it was beef... it was grayish looking.  The only saving grace was the toppings... I took my burger off and ended up eating a sandwich with cheese, avocado, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  That was pretty good actually!  

It's sad that the only decent thing was their toppings.

The atmosphere was weird... it was a very poor attempt at trying to have funny signs on the wall (which were almost all about a happy wife means a happy life).  The menu was hard to read and had way too many options.  I'm guessing they sell more non-burger items than actual burgers.  Maybe they should.change the name to something like \"Sammy's Random Menu of Food N Shit\"."}
{"text":"Great food , great service!!!
The burgers are awesome plus
You gotta try the chili cheese fries and milkshakes ..."}
{"text":"Went in for the fish fry was excellent quality. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Will defiantly return there is lots on the menu I want to try."}
{"text":"I come here once a week for lunch and get the usual: bacon cheeseburger and fries. I usually take it to go. Fast service too.

It is better than fast food for sure. 

I really like this place and the girls working in front are always really sweet."}
{"text":"I waited to get at least a few visits in before writing my review: They have been consistently awesome each visit. The burgers are always cooked right, the service is always great and the place is always clean. The \"Touchdown\" is my go-to burger. It's HUGE and is just enough to fill up this 245 pounds of manliness! I'm so blessed to live right around the corner from this gem. Five out of five stars!"}
{"text":"Nice relaxing place to enjoy lunch, pleasent order taker. 

Burger was very good, i got a regular order of fries that was overflowing in my take out bag (no complaints here). Someone else recommended the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich whick I am going to try next visit.

They have several tv sets on for patrons to watch, very clean pleasent place to eat.

There are also patio style tables outside, if you want to sit outside.

I've been recommending Sammy's Burgers to others."}
{"text":"We tried it out tonight and were pleasantly surprised.  The service was slow but I'm not surprised as they newly opened and are probably working out some kinks.

Burgers and fries were excellent!  Even the salad was delicious and I wasn't expecting much...but the lettuce was very crisp and fresh and the toppings (chef) were abundant!

The only thing that wasn't great were the onion rings.  Good flavor but not crispy at all.

Homemade thousand island or 'special sauce' was delicious!

Nice find!"}
{"text":"Sammy reminds me of home. Growing up we visited a small local burger shop that was soooo good! Fresh ingredients thick cut fries and shakes. I have found a little piece of home in sammys. Great burgers great fries and lots of options"}
{"text":"Had the bacon and egg breakfast. Everything was good except I had untoasted Sourdough bread,very little margarine . Like a blop on each piece.  Friendly service. Will try a burger next time!"}
{"text":"This was my first and last time at Sammy's Burgers.

I was excited to see that they were offering loco moco, but my excitement turned to disappointment when they brought me an incredibly undercooked egg.

I asked them if they could finish cooking it and they just stared at me with a puzzled look.

I won't set foot in any restaurant that doesn't know how to cook an egg.

This is one of the basics and if they are ignorant of the basics, then I can't trust that anything they cook won't make me sick.

To make the experience worse, the service was slow and we were not given utensils.

Before any of this was rectified some crazy idiot with a gun sat down next to us, so we decided to pack up our food and leave.

I would avoid this business until their cooks go get some proper training."}
{"text":"Nothing special and it's hot in there. Food reminded me of generic fast food burgers, not a lot of flavor and greasy. It was so hot in there we ended up getting our food to go. If you own a restaurant/store in the Phoenix area during summer, spend the money to run your air."}
{"text":"Stopping at Walgreen's on the corner, we noticed this restaurant in a small strip mall close by.  We decided to give it a try, as we are big fans of the HAMBURGER.   When we walked in we were immediately welcomed.  You order from a counter and they bring your meal to your table when ready.  My husband and I both had the chili burger and were glad we did.  It was juicy, large and delicious.  The fries were so fresh, crispy and hot...straight out of the deep fryer.  Yum, yum.  We will definitely return...thank you for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Tried breakfast and I give it a 10. Quaint little place, and reasonable priced. Didn't expect the portions of food we were served. They also serve lunch and dinner with lots of options. I will definitely try lunch and their dinners in the near future. You got to check this place out, you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! The burgers and fries are very good. Love the mom & pop feel of the place. My family loves eating here."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. I would definitely come here, again. Hubby ordered the all-you-can-eat Friday fish fry, but the portions are big, so he could have easily gotten the 4-piece for less money. The fish was good, though, too. The menu is big, which is the only real drawback. People seem overwhelmed when trying to decide what to order. I think this place would really take off with a more simplified menu. Otherwise, it was delicious, the staff were friendly, and the prices were good. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, recommended highly from family. Had lunch, the cluba and a dbl cheeseburger and it was so delicious! The fries were awesome. My daughter loves the wings. Came for breakfast today and had the belgian waffle, eggs and sausage. Everything was amazing. Will definitely be back!  The staff is really friendly too!!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. The California cheese burgers are the best. We went all the way from Phoenix to eat burgers at Sammy's great place to throw party for friends"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Sammy Burger because it was the closest thing to my home town food until today. I have spent lots of money here and I go in here multiple times a week to order more than $60 dollars in food. I went in today to order my usual breakfast order that would have probably been over 60 dollars and the waitress/owner tried to charge me $0.50 for extra seasoning on my steak and told me that seasoning was very expensive. I was a very valuable customer and loyal to their restaurant almost all of the employees knew me by name and order. I felt disrespected and cheated by the owner when she tried to charge her customer for a little extra seasoning on a steak that most of the time is bland. If they had put enough seasoning on the steak all the time then I would not have had to ask for extra. I would never eat here again because I do not agree with cheating your customers or creating new charges without it being stated on the menu or ever being charged before. I hope this review is helpful and I hope you decide not to invest in their business since they don't care about their customers. 1 star because I had to."}
{"text":"Came around 11am..it was good to have breakfast and burgers on the same menu. Everything was ok, minus the fact they can't temp the burgers... i.e. (med rare, well.ect.) they say you get what you get"}
{"text":"Classic burger joint feel with a great value for meals. You get alot of burger/crispy fries and huge drink. If you looking for something for lunch or afternoon bite to eat give this place a try switch it up from the usual fast food."}
{"text":"First of all I was very excited to try this place out , the food was great BUT the customer service was terrible . The food came to us cold and the fries seemed like they were left overnight . They warmed it up for us in the microbe and made it even worse . They got my order wrong twice . I wouldn't come back . I'm utterly disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"I had to change my review because I went back a few times and I think that it was just an off day when I wrote my first review.... the food is great and the customer service has gone way up!! Great job! Great prices for large portions! My favorite local place!"}
{"text":"Took my wife out to eat here this evening. Food was good steak had some Gristle and fat. The highlight of the establishment was the service and the cheeseburger. Will return again and try the chicken next time. The restaurant was clean and had a pretty homey feel to it"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for breakfast lunch and dinner. And I've loved all of it 
My daughter loves it here. Only draw back is the chocolate milk is almost $3 for a bottle that you buy for $1.69 at most gas stations 

Love me some burgers California style"}
{"text":"Okay this spot is super LEGIT!! Dare I say... even, too legit to quit??!! :D

Drove by wanting to pick something up to eat from QuikTrip when this place caught my eye. Felt adventurous and decided why not. Needless to say it was a great decision. The menu selection seemed like it was put together by the hands of God. I mean seriously... no matter what you're craving, they got it!

I ate the Slam Dunk Burger with some sweet potato fries to go with it. Buddy had the French Dip sandwich and both were deeeeeeelicious. The burgers there was by far the best you can get anywhere in that side of town I guarantee it.

Exceptional food, fast and friendly staff, awesome menu selection, and cheap prices... This place has the perfect combination that makes this a weekly visit!!!"}
{"text":"First thing you notice when you walk in is a heavy grease smell must be poor ventilation in their kitchen. We ate  on the tables they had outside so that rectified that problem. Had the burgers which were above average. We had no idea what a single double triple  or home run burger was as it was shown on the board , turned out the burger I wanted with tomatoes onion and lettuce was a home run .Will try it another time but if the smell is still there  that will discourage us from returning a third time as our clothes smelled of grease as we got into the car."}
{"text":"Yumm.  Great burgers.  They taste as good as it smells.  Huge portions.  Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is good! Its clean and friendly. We had the Hatch Burger, chicken tenderd and a mushroom cheeseburger. It was all very good. We also had the fried zucchini and fries! They arebthe best I've had so far! We will be back I cant wait to try their breakfast and shakes"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there a few weeks ago. I had the country breakfast bowl. Awesome and they gave me a lot of food. I had to take some home. I don't remember what my wife had but she said it was just average. That happens at every restaurant. I say try it. I think you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Been waiting for a really good burger spot to come to Goodyear for a long time now.  
Very good burger.  Shredded lettuce which is a must.  Well seasoned burger.  May be homemade thousand island.  Very good. Fries crispy. Service good   Clean.   If you like 'Mom n Pop' burger places you will love this one!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great burger! My husband had the fish and it was excellent. Portions are generous! We look forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I like that they have breakfast, lunch and dinner options. The food is delicious and the staff are very friendly. It's one of our favorite places for a burger."}
{"text":"Great selections on the menu,  we tried the chicken and waffles,  teriyaki burger,  pastrami burger,  and sweet potato fries.  Everything was great,  can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  Their service is awesome,  ask for Johnathan"}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles and LOVE a local burger joint called Troys. 
Sammy's burgers is hands down great! Reminds me of home. Staff great and friendly! Burgers charbroiled and juicy. Chili cheese fry heaven!"}
{"text":"Came here on Presidents' Day lunch hours. It wasn't too busy when I came and and placed an order. It picked up just before I finished my burger. The service was good. The layout of he place was much better than the previous burger restaurant it once was. This time it's done more with painted on brick look and looks much cleaner. I grabbed a cheeseburger and a chocolate milk. Weird combo but that was the current crave. The burger was good. It wasn't bad and tasteless but it wasn't amazing. It definitely hit the spot! They had quite a menu option and I would like to come back and try out something else. The definite plus is that they have all day breakfast. That's a win!"}
{"text":"My go to place for omelettes and Shakes. I wish they would call it Sammy's diner because you can get anything there."}
{"text":"Amazing! Go here! We have been several times and everytime we have had the best service and great food. Kuddos to Vanessa and Rigo who are the friendliest, most well trained young adults I have seen in a long time.  These 2 were truly fantastic and they ARE the reason we have come back again and again.  Rigo makes the best shakes,  I think we'd cry if he ever left.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"\"Life is too short to miss out on beautiful things like a double cheeseburger.\" ? Channing Tatum

Dang, that char on that burger is no joke.  My friend's double bacon cheeseburger put my hatch chile burger to shame but it's all good.  The hatch chile burger had good flavor, a nice char, and came wrapped up like a newborn baby.  I hate it when I get a burger with no wrapper and the juice slides all over the place.  The fries came unsalted which I actually appreciate.  Crispy on the outside, fluffy and creamy on the inside.  It was the perfect fry.

If this place wasn't so far, I can see myself eating here more often.  It's a modest sized place with lots of booths and tables for you to sit at.  The staff is friendly and the menu is huge!  Stop into Sammy's if you're in the area.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer and i absolutely love their burgers. However, the guy who takes orders is very rude and unprofessional. This is the second time he's taken my order and is very rude. I came in two weeks ago and he completely messed up my order so when i came back today i mentioned it to him and all he said was \"bummer.\" It's very annoying knowing that i paid for my food to only not get what i ordered and i at least expected a \"I'm sorry\" considering i come here often."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good little local burger place and we weren't disappointed. The chili cheese fries and burger were excellent and we also tried the hatch burger and rings. Everything was on par. Will be returning to try breakfast."}
