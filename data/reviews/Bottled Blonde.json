{"text":"Lets just say i am a very easy going & understanding person & it takes a lot to annoy me. Probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a place like this. I was visiting AZ last weekend, friends suggested I go here since its a new place in old town. Got there around 8.30 and after 25 mins of looking for table we found one. It took another 20 for someone to take our order (we ordered food & drinks). As we waited for our food  the rude bouncers came and asked us to get up and move to the next table, we did, then a few minutes later, they told us they needed the chairs we were sitting on, and they took those as well. At this point our table had been pushed completely In front of a hugeee fan, & we had no chairs. While standing around like fools & telling the bouncer had food coming,the bouncer said he would get us chairs & turn the fan off- it never happened. The next part is what ticked me off- the server brought our food and placed it right in front of the fan, allowing dirt & dust To be blown on it, not to mention the cheese on my pizza coagulated within seconds. 10 mins after the food was just laying around . At this point I refused to eat the food & continued to finish my drink & asked for the bill to pay for my drinks. This is quite funny, I get the bill and they had charged me for my the food as well. Not one apology, not one 'let me see if I can find a table'. The server was nice enough to bring us 2 free beers which I didn't even touch because I was soo annoyed. But overall it was an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Not my type of place at all. We went on a Saturday night around 9:30. It became super crowded and super loud. I get it, clubs are both of those things, but it gets old when it's excessive and you're bumped into every five seconds and can't hear your friends. Plus, whenever a bottle service table was about to be occupied, the bouncers cleared a path around the table about five feet wide, which was a bit dramatic and led to even more crowding for everyone else. Finally, the waitresses' outfits...really?"}
{"text":"The games in the back add a lil something chill. And feeling like ur not out the club trying to have a smoke is chill."}
{"text":"Came in twice on saint patties day and no service twice trying to get drinks this place kinda sucks"}
{"text":"Holy drunkeness...  Let's just say if youre looking for a boppin place on a random Thursday night, this would be it. It's hard to rate a bar for a particular night or two just because it depends on the crowd...but there's a few things you can note:  *It gets SUPER crowded, scope out a table on the outskirts and you'll be happy you did *People unfortunetely believe that they can smoke wherever, whenever...as close as burning my friend's arm. (The bar did do a good job of clearing this kid out). *Youll be waiting at the bar for quite a bit to get drinks *Music's solid though, at least for the night we were there and we were able to get one of the \"outside\" tables which was awesome."}
{"text":"Does happy hour end at 6pm or does it end at 7pm?! I don't know and neither do the servers. Be prepared to get screwed. Have fun"}
{"text":"I can't speak to issues dealing with drunken lost credit cards, but I can say that this is one of the best local spots there in the Scottsdale area. The bar service was excellent; the hostesses were polite and welcoming, and the crowd was fun."}
{"text":"I'm writing a review because my bartender Christine made the experience here amazing. She was extremely attentive, sweet, and quick despite it being crazy packed. This is the only place I drank all weekend that gave me a water without me having to ask and I didn't have to beg for more. She was so appreciative of her customers and thankful for any amount of tip.  I can't speak to the friendliness of the bouncers because we arrived early before a line even started so there wasn't an issue, however all the staff inside the building was very nice. The security guards were just doing their jobs and overall were very considerate when walking through crowds and were apologetic when they had to get by. With such a crazy atmosphere I was expecting rude staff and to be ignored but I was so impressed with the people I interacted with."}
{"text":"Fun place to grab some drinks! We came in a little early right before it started going crazy for the night during our Spring Training trip. Some Jack Daniels promo girls rode in on a fire truck and were giving out free shots from a fire extinguisher which was pretty awesome. My only gripe about the place was that it got way too crowded really fast; they definitely weren't doing a good job at the front door. It became impossible to get a drink and got so packed that people started getting pushy. Other than that, definitely a cool spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Love the patio, atmosphere, and overall feel of this bar; great place for day drinking! I personally didn't try any of the food but the friends I was there with did and really enjoyed everything they ordered. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Long wait in line for the smallest dance floor. Security is rude. Used to be a place to go. When they don't continuously let ppl in, giving them space to move, its a good place to go."}
{"text":"don't support this place! dont support any restaurant owned by les corieri !!! hes a known racist and homophobe who will not serve blacks, jews, mexicans, poor, gays, or men with wedding rings at his chicago location.....  his pr person uzra zo claims this is for safety....this place allows you to carry in a concealed handgun but will reject you at the door if your gay......"}
{"text":"Worst place ever!! Stuck up staff! Poor service! Be ready to pay bank for water down shots?!?! This place sucks!"}
{"text":"Interesting place to have a drink, lots of TV there, and variety of wine. It's a nice place for relax and fun with friends."}
{"text":"The service is so horrible the bar tenders are ridiculous. They are so rude and stated they don't care who comes here! They said they are to good for Scottsdale!?!?"}
{"text":"Worst bar in Scottsdale bartenders are so rude. I hope their business go downhill. I will never go back to this bar again."}
{"text":"Another great Scottsdale weekend in the books! Not going to lie I was a little bummed to show up and see HiFi closed for remodeling but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I reached out Dan from HiFi (Great guy with New York style) and not only did he take a break from his busy schedule to meet me while at lunch, he put me in touch with AJ and Chase at Bottle Blonde. I purchased bottle service (The only way you should enjoy Scottsdale) the entire weekend  in a couple of different sections. Sara, our server, was amazing! Timely checks in, great conversation and all round positive vibe. This last thing might set them over the top but the security was on point! In a place this big with the amount of people they host you have to have great security team that's on the same page. Major shout out to AJ, Carl, Kenny and there are 2 others that unfortunately I don't remember their name but their service was greatly appreciated! In all, thank you Bottle Blonde and the entire EEG team for a great weekend!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience with a short hispanic front door bouncer named Matthew.  We frequent old town a bit and we were at district and decided to stop by bottled blonde.  We have visited this location a few times prior to this experience so the situation that took place was quite appalling.  Matthew stated my wife is not the person on her ID.  So we presented a credit card with her name on it.  What more proof do you need?   Well, there are plenty of other bars that would be happy to take our money so we were going to go to El Hefe instead, No BS at that spot.  However, Matthew did not want to give my wife back her ID.  This is where I got irritated you wasted my time for 10 minutes already, now you're trying to waste another 5 min?  Well I wanted to call the police and get this squared away, we have proof this is her identification and Matthew is clearly an idiot that needs more training.  Then some very tall gargantuan meat head looking fellow starts yelling at the top of his lungs saying we should not be swearing.  Guy, this isnt church, I will say whatever the hell I want especially because your keeping us here wasting our time.  Sigh.  Matthew ended up giving us back the ID before the police were called and this whole situation could have been avoided if he gave us back the ID.  But now im stuck writing this essay telling you about my shitty experience at this location.  I would not recommend going to this location."}
{"text":"Went to the OSU Michigan block party.  Had a reservation.  Get there at 8, as instructed, only to find out that they took too many reservations and we were across the street in a IOWA bar. Then we couldn't get in til 9, so we waited around for an hour only to be put at table with our backs to the projection screen and facing no tv's!   Most unorganized event ever."}
{"text":"Security Guard didn't want to let me in just because I look young. Even after I showed them my drivers licence. Then one of them came over and said I need a second form of ID with the other one. I took me  Then they asked me What year I graduated high school? I said I think it was two years ago. And the guy said \"I think\" doesn't work here. He asked the exact year and I said I couldn't remember. He was like people usually remember the year. I said I have long-term memory problems sometimes. 10 minutes after they finally let me in."}
{"text":"I had my bachelorette party here and was shocked by how unprofessional and rude the staff was. The bouncers and security guards were particularly disgraceful. They were extremely rude and demeaning to me and my friends. If it wasn't for the happy occasion we were celebrating, I would have left immediately and demanded our money back for the table and bottle service we purchased. These people really need a reality check on how to treat paying customers. I would not recommend Bottled Blonde to ANYONE looking to purchase a table and have a good time."}
{"text":"If I can go back in time and write this about a year ago I would but I have been busy, I just want everyone to know I had a horrible experience. If I can give it a zero I would.    About a year ago I had arrive at a good time to watch a fight on UFC, (6:00 pm) We had planed to stay there all night if it weren't for that horrible time I had.             Anyway my night started off like this, it was all four of us. During the night we order pizza and beer and stuff during the fight. Everyone was helping us left and right but did not spot out the waitress all night, i guess she was serving as well. Before the fight ended the bouncer had told us to leave the table, I told him that the fight was not even over and that I still had food on the table. He did not care at all, he told us that the table was reception for some one else..... I was like you should of told us that a long time ago instead of me ordering this food now I'm not going to eat it standing ..... He did not seem to care, as soon as the fight was over the guys took everything, including my beer that was not even finished.. I told the waiter right away what had happen.. She replace my beer right away.... At this moment i was already frustrated and annoyed and angry... Such and      embarrassment...  .. The fight had ended and i was just standing enjoying my beer, when it was time to check out I decided to not give any tips, WHY ..... they took my food, they kicked us out of the table, and left us standing like dogs in the corner. So my friend left her 2 dollars, I was like they don't even deserve a firkin penny! The waiter came back and asked me as there anything wrong with my service? I said yes so I explain everything to her it seem like she  did not care. She said that was not part of her service.  She said well I don't want your 2 dollars.She threw them on the table where I was leaning against.. After 30 Min's I decided to leave and never go back to that bar in my life... its been a year..."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy having a cold drink in a big patio. Great music and nice setup. Pet friendly."}
{"text":"Met friends for happy hour drinks. Walk in ask to be seated and Security guy to busy on phone says go outside and get the girl thats her job.  That should have been my first clue.  They seated us, finally after 20 minutes our waitress came to our table took our drink order another 20 minutes and she returned.  We ask what food she recommended since it was our first time(will be my last) she grabbed the menu from my hand and said  im new and dont really know the menu.  We ordered another 20 minutes went by got our appetizers and had to ask for another drink. She never came back we had to ask to get her she was in corner on her iphone.we then place a food order my food came in less than 10 minutes however 2 of my friend tyook another 35 minutes (for a salad) then waitress came back to say she forgot to put the order in.  Fast forward we were not even finished with our meal and the security came to our table and said that we had to get up because it was a certain time and the table needed to be removed due to fire standards we were in the middle of eating.  we had a party of 8 people spent well over $1000.  The manager came over was beyond rude didnt even offer us another table. I will be contacting the owner and will deal with it.  The old thing great about this place was the live music.  everything else was terrible, food service etc"}
{"text":"They really need to clean house. Because all of the staff are rude af. We had a group of 6 & we stood in line for an hour & finally got to front. We told the door guy there is six of us & we were being shoved from behind & we looked back & the door guy just told us we couldn't get in. They are big Trump Supports because on their IG page they were having a trump support party. & we are all minorities so hello connect the dots. They are rude af their security staff are white haters. I will never go back."}
{"text":"The Food was really bad and the services was worst either, the place was a mess, beer is spills all over and no one cares to put a wet floor sign and pinball machine was broken, I will never go back to that place, it's ran by dumb ass that don't want to keep business."}
{"text":"Love this place! First time I've been here and I can't believe i didn't come here sooner. This is the place to be."}
{"text":"Came down for spring training first weekend in March and let me just say this, the staff at the bottled blonde were first rate from security to the bathroom attendant.  Food was amazing and drinks were easy to get. If you're in Scottsdale AZ you have to go!!!"}
{"text":"We came here to watch UFC fights last night and we literally got kicked out of our table because we weren't ordering food anymore. 4 of us were there 3 hours, order 2 pizzas and an appetizer. I had three premium draft beers, my husband had a vodka drink and the other couple we were with had 5 premium draft beers between the two of them. So it's not like we didn't order our fair share of food and drinks while we were there. We were just at the point we were slowing down.   We had a girl come to our table and tell us if we weren't ordering food we had to close out and give the table up. As we were leaving I overheard the managers looking over the table chart and said \"if people aren't ordering, the tables need to be turned over.\"    I give one star because they have a good beer selection but their practices are totally unethical. Won't ever go there again."}
{"text":"A great place for brews, drinks & pizza. Beautiful young blonde bartenders & waitresses. Near Arizona St University. In Scottsdale, Old Town, great neighborhood with lots of bars & restaurants, & guys with large golf carts that will ride you around town. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went to Bottled blonde on a Saturday and I must say I was blown away with a great time!! The music was on point the media on the TVs added to the over all atmosphere!! I am excited to return to Arizona with my friends so they can get a taste of the Bottled Blonde!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to other's bad experiences here, but it was a happening spot for a Tuesday night.  The staff were nice and prompt and I liked the place. Hopefully the management read the other reviews and plenty of people disagree."}
{"text":"I've been to better... I've been to worse. Music was good. We got bottle service so by definition the drinks were very expensive. Servers did a great job. Especially eliminating the leaching girls who are just trying to snag a free drink.  The crowd was somewhat mixed but I suppose you get that at any club wherever you go. Fun night out."}
{"text":"Do not go to this bar. bartenders try to add extra money to your total on your tabs. Happened to me. Total girl friendly, They rather keep a girl in the bar that pays for nothing and kick the guys out who pay the bill. They own Hi-Fi so don't go their either. Food sucks and is over priced!!"}
{"text":"My group of girls and 1 guy were all wearing sneakers and they refused entrance to the one man of color for wearing sneakers... to be clear, all girls were also wearing sneakers as were the white frat boys in front of us.  I'd recommend of the many other bars on this street instead! District across the street is awesome"}
{"text":"I don't care if you're partying there, work there, or even own the place. If you push me & don't even say sorry or excuse me..i'm going to say you should  do some kind of gesture you need to get through instead of pushing through people & if you want to kick me out I could care less. Employees need to learn manners or not be so biased as who they choose to be nice too. Also, I asked a security guard if I could use the restroom and I would leave something behind so he would know I came back & he said no. That's fine..but then I see multiple people being let in after that. Overall 0/10 experience."}
{"text":"Mistakenly came here for a second time, on my birthday, no clue why. The doormen asked my wife where we were prior and she named a bar that recently closed and they refused her entry saying she was too drunk. What a joke. The bar we were at was only open for four days and she couldn't recall the new bar's name so she stated the previous name and they deny entry for THAT? Never again. Avoiding at all costs. Spare yourself."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game and stay for the party till the wee hours. Never get sick of this place.   Great bar staff and surprisingly great food. Not your typical freezer-burnt bar food!"}
{"text":"I can't even say anything about the food because I couldn't even get in the place. Pizza + beer + TVs for games + a bar...sounds and looks like a sports bar to me.  It was a Sunday and this area of Scottsdale was booming with football fans. All I wanted to do is get some pizza and beer before a show at Livewire next door. I never made it in, though--I got stopped at the front for wearing Jordan shoes. Even though girls there were wearing basic sandals and guys wearing what I could describe as flat skate shoes. Okay, so I guess this place is a club.  Next time I will wear a suit with coat-tails, top hat, and a monical.  Wait, no I won't because I won't ever try to get in this place again."}
{"text":"Great vibes. This is the place to be on a Friday night, Saturday or Sunday during the day, the music is always amazing, the people are so fun. I have the best memories spent here at Bottled. It's the number one spot on the block, my friends and I can spend hours on hours here. The bouncers are always friendly, and the bartenders make the drinks with an extra splash of alcohol, I love it."}
{"text":"Security guards are straight assholes and don't know how to do their jobs, payed a ridiculous amount of money for a table and waited about 15 or 20 minutes for a security guard to finally let me in after trying to get his attention for quite sometime. Maybe it was my bad for thinking that if I'm spending over a grand at some place for a nights fun that they'd treat me with some sort of respect? but clearly as I said before security doesn't seem to know how to do their job. Never will I go there again let alone rent a table. If you plan on going out go down the street to the Mint or something at least they don't act like their shit doesn't stink."}
{"text":"Wouldn't come back here. Really unprofessional staff. Was treated rudely on several occasions by their waitresses. Spoke to the manager about it and he brushed it off and kept going about his business as if I was pestering his busy schedule. All in all there are plenty other bars I can go to in Old Town. This one is not for me."}
{"text":"Let's just say we spoke more often with the security guard next to the table than the waitress who came around once every hour. Food was ok, but having to get up and get your own drinks for the table kind of defeats the purpose."}
{"text":"Went here for a bachelor party there was maybe 15 of us paid for bottle service but they wouldn't let me in???? What???? Tells me to get out of line I try to talk to the manager and tell him I have a table in there he simply says SO... Go get back at the END of line??? I finally get ahold of the fellas at the table already they LET me in finally.. Heres the kicker! Two of my friends get into an argument security comes over and completely over react I'm thrown off stage land on my back we get into a brawl WITH security my boy eye gets swollen shut because he got a punch in on one of them we all get kicked out.. some of us put in cuffs my flight is in three hours.. It was a mess.... bottled blonde was the worst"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a good review but when you turn away a $250 pair of Jordan's but let in a $30 pair of new balances I can't help but bring that up. That's absolutely ridiculous and I will be sure to give this place a terrible review and never recommend it to any fiends."}
{"text":"Up until several months ago, this used to be a great place with friendly bartenders and one of the few places in Scottsdale you could mingle in.  Now, they blast hip-hop as if trying to sound a desperate siren to attract people away from its competition across the street and next door.  Most of the bartenders look harried and miserable.  Good luck getting a drink in a reasonable amount of time.  Despite living in the neighborhood and frequenting this place for more than a year, the bouncer I'm most familiar with would not let me in the front ropes on a weekend night.  Guess customer loyalty means nothing to the owners.  This on top of the fact that I likely saved their asses from a lawsuit when a girl fell down hitting her head and neck, barely remaining conscious, while I intervened to ensure the manager and any bystanders did not move her until the ambulance arrived.  I don't recall getting any thank you for that either.  Guess helping to protect their business means nothing to them too.  The bottom line is that Bottled Blonde is Broken."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Sunday and it was a great experience, with good, attentive service. I got the margarita pizza and a mimosa. The prices were not astronomical. There weren't rowdy people getting drunk like some of the other bars in old town during this time of the day, 2 pm. The servers were kind and my food and drink came out quickly. It was a beautiful day to sit on the patio and the music was not too loud to where I could still have a conversation with friends."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer even on a Sunday wow was this place the place to be its been a while since ive been out on a sunday and i had a great sunday funday thanks to this place the pizza was not bad either"}
{"text":"The bartenders were so rude. My phone fell out of my purse and every of the bartenders said \"oh well it was wasnt turned into me\" without being willing to check with a manger. It was only when i told the bouncer that i couldn't get on my flight tomorrow that it \"magically\" reappeared. I guess thanks to the bouncers, but not friendly or helpful staff"}
{"text":"I came here on Memorial Day and it was packed. Bottled Blond was bustling and seemed more like nightlife type of establishment rather than a pizza bar.   As for the bar, the service was not very attentive and the alcohol selection was standard. I wasn't able to try any of the pizza but I heard from a local that it wasn't that great.   I don't really have anything spectacular to say about this place. It was about as interesting as, the name suggests, a dumb blonde."}
{"text":"Same old Old Town story. Although I have to say the service was not bad for us. We ended up staying at that bar the whole night when we usually hop around. It got crowded but not to the point, I couldn't breathe like some other bars nearby."}
{"text":"Trevor is an interesting one, but I'm in love with him so it's kind of a weird thing. Although every time we ordered drinks he rolled his eyes which was unwelcoming. Anyways, decent environment, fun, but it's expensive like every other bar out here."}
{"text":"If you come from a city of more than 2 million don't waste your time here... Or at any club in this area. Everything is s glorified sports bar. It pretentious without cause or reason. BIG FAT BOO TO THIS DUMP"}
{"text":"WOW.  Finally somewhere that still has good customer service!   I came here last weekend and it was definitely a packed house. I made my way to the bar and the bar tender who was making other drinks looked at me and kindly let me know he would be right with me! I was impressed.   Almost every bar tender you approach these days ( yes in the Scottsdale area) just looks right through you and gets around to you when he feels like it. No greeting or nothing.   Anyways the bartender made it back to me and he made some great beer suggestions and also answered my food related questions. He made a great pizza recommendation and also let me know of the other great foods they had. Let me know that his name was Sean and if my group and I needed anything else, just to let him know!  Overall it was just nice to go somewhere where the service staff was just flat out nice and helpful. It is rare these days to see customer service shining through when an establishment is really busy and packed full of thirsty people. I will definitely  be coming back here and i hope Sean is working again!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite spots in Oldtown but sadly on this trip I walked in and sat down but no one ever came over to ask if I wanted anything to drink.   So after about 15-20 minutes, I left.  It wasn't busy but I hope this was just a bad night since I have had outstanding wait staff/bartenders in the past."}
{"text":"One of the worst bars I have ever been to. Every single person that works here is super rude, especially the general manager. I would gladly go anywhere else but here, dont even bother."}
{"text":"We had a bottle service girl named Sarah-probably the most unprofessional encounter that I've ever experienced at a bar/club. I understand having a drink with a client, but multiple from every bottle is a bit much. Especially since she was spilling drinks on some of the customers she was hosting, it was a bit sloppy.  The music was great and the decor was on point and I would have given them five stars, but the unprofessionalism the bottle service girl showed was just unreal."}
{"text":"OH-IO - STATE BAR on Saturdays during the season. So, if you BLEED scarlet and grey like me, youll LOVE to come check this place out. Also the food is pretty darn good. They get a little uppety on weekend nights, but thats Old Town."}
{"text":"Pizza place? I'm from Chicago... fughetabaddit.. but to chill and grab a drink.. SOLID.. cool staff, cute bartendresses... Surrounded by more great bars incase you get the urge to roll.."}
{"text":"It is another Old Town bar with douchy bouncers at the door and scantily clad bar gals (not sure they deserve the title bartender because they are paid to look cute and be young, not be mixologists).  They don't really have that great of a beer selection, which I would expect from a place with the name Bottled Blonde. The DJ has been quite fabulous the few times I have been here (nice remix of older songs mixed in with the hip and new).   I don't think I would ever eat here, unless I was inebriated and my taste buds were impaired.  But in comparison to other bars in the 'vortex of the Old Town Bermuda triangle' I recommend it."}
{"text":"Alright, so I've successfully came here both for the nightlife AND the Ohio-backer bar experience. I will attempt to review them separately.  Here is the short version for the nightlife version of the bar. Aesthetically nice. Very expensive drinks. Shit layout. Bouncers will knock you over like a linebacker if they need by to make way for bottle service, to silence a fight, or go get a girls number he's been eyeballing all night. Little to no place to sit or stand unless you have a table.  Here is the short version for the Ohio-backer version of the bar. Same expensive drinks. Nice HD TVs of the game EVERYWHERE. Shit-tons of Ohio Buckeye peeps. Absolutely nowhere to sit or stand unless you got there 3 hours before the game or reserved a table.  Long version for both the above. At night there are a ton of people packed in this place. Which is nice - nobody wants to be in an empty club on Friday or Saturday night. However, it is a legit, straight-up struggle to get anywhere in here... sober or drunk. The place is kind of separated into two bars - one bar kind of outside and the other is inside and lines the dance floor. To go between the two you have to wiggle through a door that is lined and packed with people. To go to the bathroom you at the very least have to struggle through the dance floor, if not through the door and the dance floor.   The music was good. I like to dance so I was happy to stay on the dance floor and avoid the door. However, I didn't start there and the few times I tried to \"walk a lap\" or go round up a lost friend it was pretty much, as we called it in the military \"nut to butt formation.\" The line around the place moved slow and so you were forced to hump the person in front of you and be humped by whoever was behind you. As you can imagine as the night goes on... and the alcohol has been flowing this can be interesting to give and receive. I don't really have a personal bubble (see previous comment about the military) so that didn't really bother me but I'd guess people that have a personal space bubble or claustrophobia might not like this. Oh, and if you don't like drinks spilled on you or knocked out of your hand while walking through, this also might nit be like you. In fact, now that I think about it... it was kind of running a gauntlet with 50 other people where everyone tries to knock you over or knock crap out of your hand as you pass.  This includes the bouncer at the door who feels the need to break up a fight with the other 18 bouncers at the rear of the bar... only he gets the magical authority to hit you like you are a tackle dummy on the ASU practice field. No apologies. Just wear your drink you lil bitch... and enjoy it.  That is a literal true story, BTW.  I have no idea how many times I saw, had friends, or experienced getting hit with drinks in my hand. It was like, cool, I got my drink... and someone would get a signal that they were required to barge down the aisle so that when you turned around they'd hit your drink. Again, no apologies. I also was standing by a table and some guy full force ran and tripped over a step (the tables are elevated) and seriously punched the drink out of my girlfriends hand and let the drink... and glass... rain down on the crowd like some rap video \"making it rain.\"  Again, no apologies... much less a \"oh shit, I spilled your drink... I'll buy you a new one.\" Good thing my girlfriend is a sport and I'm not a douche and I didn't knock him out.  In any case, it kind of reminds me of a frat party that is trying to be high-class. The place is nice but it turns into a disaster as the night goes on. People seem to have checked their manners at the door.  The other side of this place is that they are an Ohio State Buckeyes backer bar. Like, all the alumni go there... banner hanging outside and everything. Merchandise is sold at the door. This is supposedly one of the bigger Ohio backer bars in Phoenix. And if you don't know, there are a lot of us Buckeyes here in the valley... and yes, they are all there packed in when the Bucks play. But man, it is the same problem as the night story - no room and expensive. With games lasting 3 hours, who wants to stand there? Purely insane people and people with tables, that's who. No thanks for me. I love partying with my fellow Bucks but I like to have an inkling of comfort in doing it. So I went across the street to District and enjoyed the game there... and when Blonde did the songs and chants... I just did it from across the street. I wasn't the only Buck to do the same.  So what is the conclusion on all this? If you want to party... like you're in a frat and on a budget go to Giligins. If you want higher class then go to the District or Hi-Fi. Higher yet, then maybe Mint, Maya, or Cake? If you want to go to a backer bar then I find Buffalo Wild Wings on Gilbert/ Warner to be awesome as it has tables, prizes, and you will still have the same crazy Buckeye atmosphere."}
{"text":"Worst place i have ever been food and drinks  Nasty servers and horrible food! GOOD LUCK"}
{"text":"The waitress was on point for how busy it was on a Friday night! However, the wings made my date and I sick! And as neat as the atmosphere there is, it looks like a mixture of every other bar in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went here on NYE, was not initially planning on it, but ended up here instead of next door. Vinny is always telling me I need to hit up these places, so we did.  Obviously, it being NYE I was expecting It to get packed, It was crowded, but not stifling so 90% of my time there, except up until about 11:45, I think they let a few too many people in, the floor by the far back bar area was WAY too crowded, I mean, completely. You couldn't even MOVE anywhere. People were trying to get to the bar, but it was just a bit too cramped. It was like trying to part the red sea at 12:30 when my friend and myself were attempting to leave.  Prior to that though, it was enjoyable. My 10$ jack and coke was a bit overpriced for what it was, the bar tender stacked it so full with ice, that I think it was gone in about 5 sips....a tad bit of a letdown for 10$ ha ha. However, I danced for a good two hours, have a blister on my toe from my heels, and had a nice time up until the complete sardine packing near the midnight countdown.  Did not try any of the food though, being that it was party night. The building is pretty cool. I enjoy the indoor\outdoor vibe. Although, I'm not sure how that fares when it is 115degrees outside, they better have a darn good AC system. (; Plenty of TVs around for (I'm assuming) game nights and such. That night The bar-tender was fast and pleasant. Obviously did not strike up a conversation with him, but he noticed me and got my order quickly. The music selection was danceable and fun. Only 1 or 2 songs I couldn't stand (by personal preference, of course), otherwise it was all good in the hood for me that night. Made my NYE fun, especially on a ridiculously cold and rainy night!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great drinks. Dj and dance music. Defiantly recommend this place !!! Take a golf cart for tips. Way better than a taxi. And cheaper !"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night with a group of girls. Let me preface this review by saying I was completely sober and didn't have a single drink the entire night. For whatever reason, the bouncers decided 10pm on a crowded Saturday night was a good time to move tables and booths across the packed bar. The bouncers were extremely aggressive and exceptionally rude and disrespectful. Instead of creating a pathway to move things, the bouncers literally just ran into people and pushed them out of the way. They ran into our group without warning, causing us to stumble forward and almost fall. The second time, we were all standing in a circle talking, when a 250+ pound bouncer moving a table backed into me, a 110 pound woman, back to back, and almost completely knocked me down. I stuck my arm and elbow out to redirect my weight so that he wouldn't knock me over and step on me and he aggressively yelled at me, directly in my face, \"WHY WOULD YOU ELBOW ME WHEN I'M SAYING EXCUSE ME\" and then proceeded to call me a \"FUCKING BITCH\" and shake his head at me. It was extremely loud and the bouncer was yelling in the opposite direction, so I couldn't hear him, and like I said, we were back to back, so I couldn't see him either. I'm not going to just let someone push me down onto the floor and injure me. This is both unlawful and unsafe. I understand that there are going to be a lot of drunk people in a bar like this, and the bouncers need to be assertive, but they do not have to be physically and verbally aggressive. You cannot just push and yell at patrons. Move the tables and booths at a less crowded time or create a path."}
{"text":"My friends and I used to frequent this bar until they stopped letting in my friend every time we came, because the color of her skin. The bouncer never gave her a chance. The disrespect and rudeness is something that I could never fathom as a human being and to see it in person hurts my heart. I can honestly say that from this point forward I would GLADLY go to ANY other establishment than this. And you should strongly consider the same."}
{"text":"As a gay man, this bar was so sub par. The music was wonderful. But the service was lackluster at best. The girl bartenders were very pretty, but their attitude left a sour taste in my mouth. The drinks are weak and over priced. At least compared to the bars I frequent. Why is a double served in a rocks glass? And the girl that was bartending was rude and acted like I was bothering her by ordering a drink. All in all you can get better service and better drinks elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit Bottled Blonde after some good reviews from acquaintances. Unfortunately, they are racist pigs there. A great friend of mine, perhaps the most handsome and well dressed among us, was turned away from entry  because of his \"white basketball shoes\", but most likely because he is black and not female. I then watched many white men get in with very similar white shoes get in without a hitch. When approached, the bouncer said \"I don't own the club, I wish it was different, but I just follow the rules.\" Glad your \"rules\" are racist. NEVER give them business!!!"}
{"text":"Been awhile, but made it back for happy hour and finally tried the pizza. The $6 pies are the best deal and it is a full meal. The chicken parm pizza (only august) was quite good, although it needed some more bread crumbs tossed on the pizza like advertised. Happy hour also had $3 domestic beers. Not sure if they use wood fired oven, but doubt it since it took more than 90 seconds to arrive. Bartenders were quite attractive and friendly, but somebody should tell us about the \"technology fee. It was just 45 cents, but still have no idea why that is present (prop 205 probably."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick 30 mins before we had to head somewhere else. Super packed on Saturday with a huge line. Definitely easier to get in with a group of all girls. A plus for having a small bar immediately when you walk in to grab a drink at. Bottled Blonde is huge so pick a spot and hang out."}
{"text":"This place is NOT for someone looking to dance in old town. Just hang out with friends and chill.  I came on a Sunday night after leaving Maya which got packed pretty fast. So we hopped on over here to see what this place was all about. Which was, not much.  It was easy and quick getting in. Once in, there's a couple of large bars. Around them is seating: couches, bar stools, etc. In the back there is a long fire pit which was convenient and nice on a cold night.  Near the bathrooms are games you can play, which is cute. The bathrooms were clean and the lighting was great, bright enough to fix makeup and check yourself.   The bartenders seemed overworked since everyone here seems to conjugate around the bar itself. I think they need more bartenders.   Overall, it wasn't very exciting. I think I'll take friends here that don't like clubbing or dancing and just want to \"chill out\" with a beer or something."}
{"text":"Ehhh. Nothing too exciting here.  $15 for a well cocktail & bottle of bud light. Very crowded on a Sunday afternoon so people must enjoy getting ripped off ?   It's a bar that I will not remember to come back to, nothing stuck out that made it different .  Also noticed bouncers being choosey on letting certain folk in.. On a Sunday afternoon?! I didn't have any issues.. But I know  for a fact, the Mint group does this on purpose to keep a \"image\" ... Heard same owners as Mint ?  Not quite sure. Nothing worse than a egoistic door guy- get real dudes!"}
{"text":"Has the cozy bar atmosphere that Old Town was lacking. The bartending staff are all very friendly & very easy on the eyes...especially Jillian!!!! Strike up a convo with her, because she's probably the sweetest bartender you'll ever meet."}
{"text":"Wanted to give a shout out to the staff and to Charlie...they are always accommodating and make you feel welcome. The food and vibe are good. Go there mainly for game watches. Thanks for making BB a fun stop for the Buckeyes in the Fall. Keep up the good work Charlie!"}
{"text":"I flew to AZ the other night from California and am visiting Scottsdale for the first time to celebrate the Fourth of July. My friends and I decided to try this place out last night and we had a blast! Great music, great atmosphere, and great bartenders. My favorite place we've gone to so far!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who almost as rule gets bottle service. I'm obviously not on that level. But I'm happy to tag along if that's your jam. And frankly, if you're coming here with a group, that's probably your best bet. Not that expensive and ensures you'll have a nice space, easy access to drinks all night, and no dickery from bouncers.   Also do your best to get a table outside.   Music was good, place was bumpin, and everyone was attractive. I think that's all you can really ask for out of a bar/club."}
{"text":"Horrible! Come here if you like cramped dance floors and shitty service."}
{"text":"0000000 stars! Worst experience  ever and the \"manager\" Drake did not care to make things right. I called after the whole ordeal to request a refund for the beers they had served us and didn't allow us to drink. He just hung up on me...twice.  We were discriminated and accused of something we didn't do in the women's bathroom when all we did was go search for my sister's phone. They will not be in business for long!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It is always hype every day of the week and the music is always good. I love that I can come here after work in jeans, or when I'm dressed up for a night on the town. They also have great food to help you out while drinking at a decent price - the pizza fries are delish! Always a good time!"}
{"text":"Thank you Raquel and Emily for being so awesome!  Terrific service and great pizza recommendation.  We had so much fun!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Ohio State atmosphere for college football! Go Bucks! Staff is great, beer cold, food good."}
{"text":"This was my favorite bar in old town! Then I went today and the bartender decided that she wanted to shame me in front of all the other bartenders! I work for rideshare share companies and whenever anyone asks me where to go in Scottsdale I Always say bottled blonde! Then today the bartender decided because my card was cracked and taped together that she would show three other bartenders my card and laugh! Damn she could have gotten a really nice tip! After 8k+ trips I'll never recommend that place again as long as people like her work there!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  After drinking for two hours at HiFi, we ordered the same exact round of drinks across the street at Bottled Blonde.  The round more than DOUBLED in cost.  Our $14 shots were $35.  The bartender called us liars when we brought it up.  He said \"I work over at HiFi sometimes and we charge more than that\" then he walked away from us.  We hunted down the manager, who was far more polite and he explained they had a formula for their pricing based on the bottle price (which was $70 at total wine).  So our two shots cost the same as a bottle.  The manager brought us a different shot to make up for the bartender's bad service.  Unfortunately, I will not go back."}
{"text":"It's really hard to give this place any more than a 3 star rating... primarily because there is nothing unique about it.  Just like every other bar on this block,  the staff is a group of extremely young girls working the bar wearing almost nothing... combined with puffed-up dudes.  That being said, we've been there a few times now and the staff was helpful and nice.  That is one thing I they do better than some of the other bars... the bartenders don't think their \"too cool\" for their customers.   A few other things to note:   1.  They do have games to play if you feel like doing something besides standing around and drinking.   2.  Decent music  3.  Their pizza looks really good... (Haven't tried it yet) 4.  Blonde Manhattan... very tasty!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time at bottled blonde with my friends. What really bothered me was after purchasing a table and spending a good amount of money, the bottle server had the audacity to come back and ask why we did not give her a 20% tip. I have been in the service industry for ten years and would never have the nerve to do such a thing (believe me, I've wanted to many times). We left her 17% and that was only because we were pouring most of the drinks ourselves. I hope this is not a common thing at your establishment."}
{"text":"The music was great but the customer service sucked!!! Went there with a few friends Sunday evening. We were having an awesome time until one of us had a disagreement with one of the waitresses, Lydia. She said my friend pushed her but she pushed my friend and then had her ejected from the club. This meant that we all had to leave. My friend did nothing. She was not being disruptive nor disorderly, she was just having fun as we all were. I hesitate to bring up the race card but I think it fits this situation. Saw security handling another situation prior to this but the people involved were not black. They didn't get removed from the club...  It is really unfortunate that things transpired as they did, my friend that was ejected actually recommended the club. Needless to say after this incident neither she nor the rest of us will be inclined to visit this establishment again. And yes...we are spreading the word."}
{"text":"The blatant racism at this establishment will not be tolerated. The fact that Bottled Blonde would employ racist and blatantly intolerant employees is deployable. I am shocked and dismayed. I hope that this establishment will see the error of their ways and employ different personnel in the future."}
{"text":"Every single day this place is packed. It doesn't matter if it's a weekday, every time I go to OT, Bottled Blond is always going off. The food there is really good bar food. Love it, go."}
{"text":"You MUST try the buratta and the grapefruit beer... To DIE!! Super fun day drinking spot or place to play a few games! They also have a cute photo booth that emails you the pix for FREE!!"}
{"text":"Wow..... I honestly don't know how to say this...... Bottled Blonde may be the worst place to go when you're in old town. I agree with Sara. The security was awful, they wouldn't let us stand anywhere. It was almost as if they were trying to make  people so uncomfortable they would leave which exactly what we did. My advice if you're visiting old town, DO NOT GO TO Bottled Blonde!!"}
{"text":"When you mix hot bartenders, massive TV screens, and good music, you really can't go wrong with the vibe. I hear they serve food but I don't come here for that. My cohorts say the pizza is good, but hey bar food is not my forte as a foodie. Hence, one star short because I have not eaten here.  I highly recommend if you are in the Ohio camp because this place is nuts on Saturday for the games. Everyone is having fun and the energy will make you break out in the school anthem! And there's bound to be some shot special being induced from a play or touchdown. Score!!! Sundays another good time to stop back for football, beers and more testosterone. Being a wingman makes me subject to this often and well, I'm a team player. The layout is perfect for playing hide and seek if you need to escape pesky inebriated men. As with any bar and being a woman I have to note that the bathroom is tucked in the back with limited stalls. I personally think it's a tactic for window shopping the patrons.   If you come to wreak havoc when the sunsets, the music will tempt you to take those sexy stilettos out until you burned enough calories to call it a night. Take pictures because even the best filters will never capture the kind of fun you are having."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. Well, that's if NO service counts as service?Been here twice, and it was horrible both times. This is coming from someone that works in the industry and is understanding of poor service at times... but NO service? Maybe going to the bar would've been a better option because we couldn't get a server to a table if our lives depended on it. I don't know if they're understaffed, or what the deal is. We left and ate elsewhere."}
{"text":"Chef Travis has done an excellent job with the food!  This is no ordinary bar food!  True cuisine!  We shared the chicken panini sandwich and the meatball sandwich, because we couldn't make up our minds. Both were excellent!  Thinking the pizza is probably awesome too!  Glad we stopped and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad once you're inside, but the security staff definitely needs to get straightened out. I was wearing black dress boots purchased from H&M and the short, bearded bouncer with black hair told me I can't come in because the \"dress code\" says no work boots. Meanwhile the dress code also says no athletic sneakers but he's letting in everyone wearing Nikes (and apparently flip flops/tank tops/bathing suits are ok too but not my H&M boots).  Seems like they want to interpret my clothing the way they want so they can let in who they want.  I also questioned why my boots are considered work boots by him and he screamed \"Get the f*&% out of here, its my f*&^ing door so leave\".  Great way to treat locals.  I asked to see a manager, and he said no.  I asked for the manager's business card, he also said no.  I then asked the other door bouncer to speak to the manager, and all he did was bring out the \"head\" bouncer.    I seriously don't know what kind of power trip these guys are on, its sad to see them act like they own the place and discriminate at the door.  I used to spend a lot of money here but not anymore."}
{"text":"love this place. was there last weekend visiting my friend...got so tanked. supper hot girls and affordability priced drinks. by far my favorite bar in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Security was overly aggressive. I went to the bathroom by myself and when I came out of the stall there were two security men standing there and grabbed me and threw me out of the bar and told me to get into a taxi. When I asked if I could go grab my purse and phone that I left at our table with my friends they refused to go get it or let me get it. They kept telling me to get in the taxi and wouldn't go get my friends for me. I finally made a big scene and was able to get my friends attention and they brought me my phone and purse.  They wouldn't tell me why I was getting kicked out and were very aggressive with me. I was very uncomfortable and sketched out by the whole situation. Don't EVER take a girl away from her friends and try to put her in a \"taxi\" without her things. They could have handled this way better. I will never go back here."}
{"text":"Your typical Scottsdale douchbag hangout, with the staff to match...bartenders are really proud of their crap drinks that they mix"}
{"text":"The Bottle Blonde participates in covert racism. They don't allow you in if you're wearing Jordans (mainly Black males) so this place gets a negative review from me. If you aren't going to allow tennis shoes, then ban all of them, not just the ones that Black males wear. I agree with other users-avoid this bar!"}
{"text":"Bottled Blonde has the longest line in the Entertainment District at all times. The first time I went to Scottsdale, I didn't get a chance to go inside because the line was basically not moving. I finally got inside Bottled Blonde this weekend, but it will likely be my last. After I had finished using the bathroom and went to look for my friends, I came to find that one of my friends had been kicked out for no apparent reason?! She wasn't acting out of line or even looked blatantly drunk. The bouncer gave no explanation to why she had to leave after we asked what she had done. It was totally unjust that she was singled out that way. Since we weren't about getting into a dispute with the bouncer, we left Bottled Blonde and didn't press further. WTF though?! I have never experienced anything like this anywhere."}
{"text":"Super fun, great environment! Had the meet lovers pizza and the broccolini! Just got off the plane, great place to unwind before the madness!"}
{"text":"We met some friends who live in Scottsdale for drinks and dinner one night.  They suggested it was a great place to chill and dine.  Cool place overall and different in a good way.  Had a guy playing top hits on his guitar and singing.  As the night went on, the crowd definitely grew.  Next thing we know we are surrounded by 10 bouncers, arms folded and  the head muscle just says \"you need to move now!\"  We were like \"WTF\".  We could not tell what we had done or why we were being told to leave.  So being we were in Scottsdale and wanted more information we decided we needed to speak the language...which ended up helping and the ring of muscles demeanor changed.   Us- \"Yo Bro, why we gotta go Bro, you know\".   Muscles- \"Yo Bro's, you got to go Bro's\" Us- \"Bro, Yo, say it ain't so Bro\" Muscles- \"Bro, you got to go Bro\" Us- \"Bro, on the down low, why so, Bro\" Muscles- \"Bro, me and the Bro's got to flex and move yo table bro\" Us- \"Bro, you means we need to move because you and yo bro's need to re-arrange the tables because it turns into a club that we never realized bro\" Muscles- \"Bro, I don't know what you meant yo, but you bro's got to go\" We sauntered out chest bumping our new friends and giving mad knuckles.  Quickly found our old table was sold to 2 typical D-bags trying to impress the ladies.    It was a mesmerizing conversation and fascinating the level of detail we derived from just a couple \"bro's\". We quickly found out the meatheads literally transform the place into a full on club in about 15 minutes and we had been sitting at one of the prime spots.  We ended up staying and dancing a little bit and the waitress got us all drinks for our dealings with the resident Neanderthals.  I'd recommend this place to anyone.  If you want to catch a dinner and plan to go dancing later, this is your place."}
{"text":"Cool bar in the nightlife district of Scottsdale!  We stopped in for a little day drinking and enjoyed the people watching.  Great patio space and nice selection of beer.  We didn't order food, but from what we saw come out we didn't think we missed anything special.  I can only imagine the craziness that must ensue on weekend nights...beware!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome anyone below who complains obviously were causing issues and or highly intoxicated.  Everyone has a good time at Bottled Blonde.  The staff and dj owners are amazing and will be back every weekend for damn sure!!!"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot ot has reasonable priced drinks, tons of tvs, lots of seating, good music, good vibes, good looking crowds, and just all around a cool place to hit up."}
{"text":"The server servers was mean and rude with us just because we were drinking some beers, while the group beside us was bigger and drinking a lot of bottles of other alcoholic drinks. Probably because of the tip I think so. She asked us to move away of that place but believe me, you would feel more comfortable if the hulk ask you to leave while he is having a bad day.  This girl was just the worst sever I have ever seen in my whole life.  If you want to have a great time at downtown Scottsdale you have plenty of great options, and Bottled Blonde is not even close to be a good one"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday, not such a busy night.  I was ignored by two bartenders when I ordered a cranberry juice.  I finally got another employees attention and asked where my drink was for the third time.  I was giving a dirty look and the blonde bartender looked at me and said what the \"F\" does it look like I'm doing back here. I spoke to the manager on duty \"Dakota\" he asked if he can offer me anything. No thanks! Give your bartenders lessons on taking orders."}
{"text":"I used to be ok with this place but the blatant racism in admitting people of color has turned me off. Not a fan, plenty of other bars in oldtown to get your drink on without supporting the bigots that run this bar"}
{"text":"The U.  Its bananas.  Anything less is ridiculous great drinks great service all around great place."}
{"text":"I love you BB! I don't listen to the children cry all over the page. You're perfectly fun and casual. I feel I owe you rent for all the time I spend under your roof!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for lunch and they have amazing pizza! I was suprised as I am a pizza purist from Chicago. Great sauce. If you try to go here on the weekend, you're going to wait in line unless you know someone at the door or have a table. Always packed on Friday and Saturday night. Great DJs and overall vibe. The crowd can be overwhelming and a bit annoying to navigate through. Definite recommendation"}
{"text":"Terrible bar,  they lied to you about how they do things and what goes on. I spoke with the manager and he told me \"fuck you\". I've never been so insulted in all my life. I think I deserve better than this place."}
{"text":"Built/run by meathead tools, FOR meathead tools.   When a giant street brawl broke out across the street (involving it seemed their own employees), naturally the whole bar pulled out their phones to Snapchat the scene.   Like some sort of meathead secret service, the bouncers came out of the woodworks to force everyone to put their phones away immediately. Strange request that people wouldn't be allowed to have their phones out at a patio bar in the middle of the day, but I complied because I don't care much for drama. I guess they were just trying to protect their employees and bar from internet embarrassment.   Nevertheless, I was promptly surrounded by multiple thug-like Bottled Blonde bouncers who forced me to leave. I had had about 3 sips of one beer at this point, and had politely complied with their ridiculous rules...At first they wouldn't let me get my credit card from the bar, until I threatened to call the police.   Video to follow for your enjoyment :)"}
{"text":"Much like its sister bars, Hi Fi and Mint, Bottled Blonde does a nice job of combining an expansive outdoor patio with a more intimate restaurant setting inside. The outdoor bar is the clear focal point to this new Scottsdale hotspot that took the place of Axis/Radius. You'll find many places to sit including low tables with comfortable patio couches. A great choice for happy hour or weekend day drinks.  Their namesake house beer was this first I tried and could have guessed it was the delicious 5% Golden Blonde Ale from San Tan Brewery! Our server Katelyn, recommended the Magic Hat #9, which is a 5.1% pale-ish ale with a touch of apricot, maybe? It was pretty good and I was pleased to see some local beers including Four Peaks and Papago.   I ordered the Tartufo fries with a killer garlic Aioli sauce. The pepperoni pizza was also quite good and not your typical bar food. It's enough to split with a friend if you're also sharing an appetizer.   With TV's all around, I can easily see this place becoming just as popular as its neighbor bars. I really dig the sleek modern look, nice staff, and overall vibe. It's worth checking out nearly any time of day. Good work, Bottled Blonde."}
{"text":"The worst place ever! The DJ is horrible and plays the worst music! We asked for several music requests for our friends birthday and he refused to play them! I am not sure what is so difficult to play some 50 cent music! It was our friends bachelorette party and we asked for 2 songs and he said yes and never played them! What a awful ending to our evening !"}
{"text":"Terrible. If I could give a negative star I would. I'm a local and have been there many times. They yelled at us to get out of the way so bottled service could go by but there was absolutely no room to move back so the fat bouncer with the beard, yelled and pushed my friend (a female 5'3 compared to a bouncer 6'2 and over 200lbs) and then on the way back he purposely walked passed us and again told us to move again there was no room to move so he pushed and forced my friend to leave. As I was walking by trying to catch them he walked by and  pushed me so I pushed back and as I was walking out he pushed me out saying since I pushed him I had to leave and I said okay but I have other friends in there that need to know and he said oh well and pushed me out. Very unprofessional and uncalled for. No need for the harassment for no reason. Worst experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"By far one of the best clubs I been too. The music was perfect and so was the environment. If you guys are ever in Scottsdale definitely check out bottled blonde."}
{"text":"good service, cool place, great music the moscow mules were inconsistent though."}
{"text":"Their security wouldn't let me in because I looked like someone they kicked out that night even though I haven't walked into the club all night, this place is just asking for bribes...  I will never come back here so many other options that are so much more fun like Hifi Intl of Majerles"}
{"text":"Came in with my girlfriend to get a table by the bar with the expectation of a couple more friends joining us. Waitress who seats us says we can either have waiter service or just order from the bar. When we went to the bar to order, bartender says it's ridiculous for us to come up to order and that we are suppose to have waiter service. Same waitress comes back and acts beyond bitchy (having an attitude, forgot 4 different things we asked for or ordered and slamming stuff down on the table). After we had enough of that bullshit, we asked for the manager. Manager ( who we eventually found out wasn't the actual restaurant manager) acted like he didn't give two shits about our experience BUT got another waitress to serve us who was great!   Food was great, second waitress was awesome and bartenders were great! But sorry sweetheart. If you don't want to serve us or have an attitude, find a new job or go home for the night. Don't take it out on the customers. Two stars since food was good and eventually the REAL manager took the time to fix the situation."}
{"text":"Best nightlife spot in the valley hands down. it gets crowded, it gets loud, and its always a blast. Great staff, great drinks, and if you're hear before it gets crazy try the Burrata."}
{"text":"I came here twice to watch a Seahawks game after the Scottsdale Seahawks group moved here when American Junkie closed and was disappointed both times. The first time wasn't horrible but the food wasn't great and servers made me feel like I was inconveniencing them every time I asked for another drink or anything at all. Top that off with food that took forever to show up, it shouldn't take that long to throw some cheese on a plate with some toast (I had the burrata) and sauce, and it wasn't even good it was bland.  The second time I came was a disaster. The guy who was serving us was just a rude dick the entire time and was too busy chit chatting with co-workers and watching the games himself to take care of us. This was an early game so I ordered the eggs benedict, while it wasn't bad the fact that it sat for several minutes on the bar while out server was too busy to be bothered to do his job chit chatted away and stared at his female co-workers. Finally one of the women behind the bar saw this and brought us our food.  At the end when I got my bill it noticed extra charges for stuff I never even asked for such as bacon which did show up on my plate but I never asked for it and just assumed it came with breakfast...I know crazy logic jump on my part. There was some other charge as well for something I didn't even get. I just remember this was $3 extra in charges on a $20 bill and while $3 isn't an issue the point was I shouldn't be charged for it. I pointed it out to the server and he went away in huff to look at it. He comes back 5 minutes later and says in a fantastically condescending tone \"So you're arguing over three dollars?\" At which point I tell him yes I am and I never ordered that stuff. He leaves in a huff again and comes back and just drops the revised bill and walks off. I wonder if he got upset about there not being $3 for a tip on there for him.  This place was dropped by the Scottsdale Seahawks group after that game because I wasn't the only one with these issues.  This place is on the fast track to being yet another in the long line of failed bars in old town. Save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always a shit show, but a semi good time. Douchebag/ bro central. You have to be a regular or in the industry to get decent service.   if you're looking to people watch, get ignored by the servers and bartenders, with NSSST NSSST NSSST blasting in your ear... this is the right place for you!  Take it for what it is. Bro Bar in old town. Gotta show up a lil intoxicated or you'll want to cut your wrist."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, Security workers are  racist there.   I wont  recommended it to none white people"}
{"text":"The bouncers and security at this place are like prison guards.....not even sure it is legal how I saw them treat people.  Stay away from this place....."}
{"text":"Bottled blonde is the place to be for craft beer good food and atmosphere. Out of all the places in oldtown it's my favorite place to go. Not too loud so you can't hear yourself think."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place but this year it's gone downhill. Tonight I sit at home waiting for my friends because I got MY REAL ID taken. Yes. That's right MY REAL ID. My address is \"1\" which I get questioned for all the time but the guy didn't even bother to scan it or anything. The thing that made me the most mad was THE THREE GIRLS IN FRONT OF ME DIDNT GIVE ANY FORM OF ID SECURITY JUST LET THE GIRLS IN. I didn't even put up a fight not worth it. Just bummed I have to get an Arizona ID now probably. I've heard a lot of complaints the past few months I'm pretty sure security is getting to big of heads. They are the judgiest bar I have gone to and I've worked on three bars on mill and have been to Scottsdale plenty of times. As I waited for my uber I saw the guy ask some people for money to get in and others not- and another probably 8 girls didn't get asked for their ID. The security guard literally just did what he wanted and now a TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD is sitting at home while a probably 18 year old is now at the bar. Just so you know the security guard is the white one, kid of brownish blonde hair you'll know exactly who he is trust me his personality sticks out like a sore thumb and not in a good way. I heard lots of people around me talking about him."}
{"text":"Bottled Blonde is a cool spot when it's not 100+ degrees outside and packed to the brim overflowing with sweaty drunken scottsdale d-bags rubbing themselves all over you and bumping into you non-stop ;)   It seems to be a more popular spot for the amateur crowd that's a little younger than me or for the older scottsdale 30k millionaire playboys that want to try to impress the 20 something's that moved here from remote parts of the US ;)    It's a cool vibe at the right time ... Come early because the lines here can be looooong on the weekends and probably aren't worth the wait to be honest.  I like the indoor/outdoor feel and the DJ here is usually pretty good, so the tunes keep this place poppin' till close...   Most of the bartenders/servers here are mediocre ... I am rating this place 3 stars because of my boy Luke C who tends bar here; he and chello would be the only two I would trust to make me drinks here.  Thank you Luke - amazing bartender & all around awesome dude!    I pretty much come here to say what's up to Luke and hope that no one gets sick or starts a fight around me lol which is happening everywhere in here ... So I usually post-up by the bar near where Luke is stationed.  I would recommend it if you want to get hammered out of your mind, act like an ass, and enjoy lots of drunkards stepping on your shoes!"}
{"text":"Always good times at Bottled Blonde! A very diverse crowd, with normal Scottsdale drink prices (meaning: pricey drinks), lots of beautiful people, and its mostly a patio area lined with VIP/Bottle Service areas. Type of music: Top 40 with a heavy EDM influence (which is my personal favorite).  Tourist/Visitors: This is an excellent place to start your night, or during Sunday Funday, come during the afternoon.   After hours spot: Go get some hookah down the street at I-MADs. That will really cool down your fun night in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Was in the area and came in with few friends. I ordered the Spaghetti and prefer Angel Hair but they didn't have so I settled for the thinnest Spaghetti they had. The food came out pretty quickly. The thin Spaghetti they gave me was close to Angel Hair so I was happy with that. However, I think they overdue on the pepper they put in so it took away the other flavors. Same happened on my friend's pasta too."}
{"text":"Best place to go if you just want to have a chill and hang with friends and not get all dressed up! I need to visit their happy hour!"}
{"text":"We had a great night celebrating my sisters graduation...until the bill came. We booked a reservation for a table confirmed at $300. A cocktail waitress named Erica who wasn't even our server all night...presented the bill..which was the correct amount and I tipped 20% on 300. She demanded that I tip her on a $600 table....ummm what?? I said very calmly I am sorry but you are mistaken we booked this table at $300 as the bill clearly states. She grabbed my credit card and ID out of my hands and said I am photo copying your ID and CC so we can run this with 20% on $600. I said unfortunately that is against the law Erica...but go ahead and try. Long story short I called the manager and explained what went down... he was mortified. It is absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced by this cocktail waitress. She is a liability to this bar as we had a great time up until she came along. Unfortunately this place will not see myself or family's business again until she is no longer an employee."}
{"text":"What a great group of people, I had a blast at this place....it is amazing how time fly when you are having fun....REALLY!!!!!!!!! Everyone was great the staff was very appeasing, the security is on point at every point...very professional and friendly....No Macho Bulls$#% just a great security team..  Thanks guys for a great time."}
{"text":"It saddens me to have to write this review. However, this is one of the few times I can truly say I felt racism. As a mm educated black female in Scottsdale I surprisingly haven't felt much racism but today at this establishment it came to fruition. The bouncer (he was very tall, large and had a beard) kicked me out and said I backed into a table. Now, granted I had already been drinking but no I did not  back into anything. And my Friends ALL backed me up. It is rare that my friends will not call me out for being drunk and acting dumb, but for once they al clearly saw that I was not acting in any way other than standing there waiting for everyone else to get in. I'm sorry but I will not tolerate this type of discrimination. And I will say this is not the first time I've had a run in with this racist bouncer. Bottled blonde just lost all of our business. Shame."}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza and pasta. Highly recommend an afternoon of playing and good food. Servers are fun and attentive. Parking easy and on the street. Nice little zone got fun and frolicking."}
{"text":"Decided to meet some friends here on a Sunday afternoon for a few drinks and we found a spot at the bar to order some drinks and decided to split a pizza. We had good service at the bar and the pizza was great! I will certainly be back to have more pizza!!!   We ended up having to leave because our friend who was in camo swim trunks wasn't allowed in (they said he wasn't allowed to have camo on or swim trunks). My boyfriend who was with me had camo shorts on and there were several people in swim trunks (as we were leaving two guys had SHORT bright neon swim trunks on getting in). Doesn't make sense at all so that was a bit of a turn off. If you are going to have a dress code please make it consistant....especially during the day on Sat or Sun when people are leaving the pool at Maya or the W."}
{"text":"I come here every weekend and spend hundreds of dollars. I've even gotten bottle service. I love bottled blonde I send a lot of people here but after last night I will be staying away for a really long time.  When I was at el hefe last night I went to wash my hands and was pushed out of the way by a very drunk girl. I told her to watch herself and to stop being a bitch because I needed to wash my hands. After that my friends and I left and went to bottled blonde. We had a fun time spent about $80 and we were dancing and hanging out.  We had to pee so we went into the bathroom. The girl that was at hefe was also in the bathroom and told security that I was threatening her at bottled (dude I already forgot about you and whatever happened) my friend told me to stay in the bathroom and not freak out and to wait for her to come out. I am pulling up my fucking skirt and security grabs me and holds me against them. I was still not fully dressed. I felt violated and harassed. I have a bunch of bruises and a weird blister on my finger from them punching me. I've never been so upset and felt so violated after what happened. I will be sending no one here any longer and I'm so sad about what happened. I've known bottled to have very racist security as well so be careful if you're not white coming in here. Attached are two photos of my arm with bruising and scratches. My other arm won't show bruising because of my tattoos."}
{"text":"I wish Bottled Blonde had two different review pages--one for late nights and the other for daytime. This review is for the latter.  Came here Friday around 5:30 for happy hour. There was live music (a guy singing and playing acoustic guitar), basketball on the TV and good food! Pizza was not the type of fare I expected here, but it was actually really well done. Daytime atmosphere was great..and the bartenders were sweethearts!"}
{"text":"Bottled Blonde is suffering from a major #identitycrisis. I like the outdoor beer garden, but the \"theme\" is so unconsistent it is uncomfortable. It is also overpriced and the people who work here are not that nice or hot #justsaying #gotohefe.  Extra star because I do have fond memories here and it is an Old Town staple circa 2014."}
{"text":"Fun place. We rented it out for a corp event. We really liked it. I'm gluten free and the staff made sure they took great care of me. So happy i let them know. I was going to go without, but one of the waitstaff asked me about eating and I told her I had an allergy so she grabbed the Chef. He came right out and took care of everything. This is a place you should stop in."}
{"text":"Decided to go there for Sunday funday. We started off with the \"tower of mimosa\". Few friends joined us later on and we ended up spending most of our noon-early evening there. Decided to check out bars across the street, had few more drinks here and there, but we decided to come back to Blonde, because they had some decent music playing. After spending lots of time there earlier in the day, they're telling us we can't come back in, because one of our companions has \"Jordan's\" on. It's funny, how it didn't bother nobody, when he had them on few hours ago when he was spending all the money for drinks. Mimosas are good, dj seems to be ok too, place is full of douchelords and sissy girls, but once you ignore all that you can have good time with your friends."}
{"text":"Bottled used to be one or my favorite spots to go out with ALL my friends in Scottsdale (Days and nights--every weekend!). The bouncer said that I was no longer ever allowed in because I was too intoxicated the weekend prior AND tried to knock his cell phone out of his hand. I was greeted with hostility and disrespect for actions I never did.   Needless to say, I do not think the bouncers should have a final say on whether or not I'm not allowed in and spend money with you guys.  Unless this matter is resolved, Bottled Blondes will be missing our business, not just mine. No more tables, no more invites from out of state guest, no more good clean fun in an establishment I stood by for the last 7 years. I would like nothing more than to get this resolved in an ethical and professional manner. Feel free to contact me so we can get this fixed the right way."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere large place with great patio theme .Drinks over priced and marginal service except at happy hour. Parking is limited unless  you use city lot two blocks away. Dress up trendy bar. In there heart of Old Town nightclub area better than most of the competition.Fine for happy hour but weekend nights it is a younger crowd in their 20tys."}
{"text":"So apparently on Sunday where its a pool environment, If your black you can't wear sneakers inside a sports bar. At 4:30 pm.  Not club hours. But plenty of white men are inside with sneakers. Even tho a basketball game is on. I guess only if ur a black athlete and they make money off of you, you still can patronize."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. This place is an absolute wreck. Overpriced drinks, Food is decent at best, the waitresses & waiters are just hot messes. I don't know if they're told to dress like they do, but the girls at hooters wear more clothes than these girls do. Seating is a joke, the noise inside is horrible, you can't even hear the people at your table. We actually got our food to go after sitting there for an hour because we couldn't take it anymore. So many better bars in the area to check out instead. Save yourself the hassle!"}
{"text":"Best deep dish pizza. Staff was super nice and good beer selection. Nice place to watch a game and hang out with friends if u actually wanna be able to talk and hear them!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and when it's a bar. Definitely better as a bar, the food is good but not amaze-balls. Better at night though the place was packed and a good crowd. Dancers on bar, DJ, looooots of people. Good time!"}
{"text":"Alright, this is the last time I will update this review, and it's back to a zero star.  After an evening of booze I left my card at the bar.  I called the next day for over an hour with no answer.  Once the bar finally opened I went to the hostess and had her check for my card....nothing there is what she told me.  I went home baffled because I knew I had left it there.  Over the next week and a half, I tried calling numerous times (leaving messages because no one ever answered the phone) and even sent the manager an email; no response.  I finally was finally able to reach someone on the phone and low and behold....they have my credit card.    These people do not know how to run a business and the front girls are either complete airheads or just don't care about inconveniencing their patrons."}
{"text":"It's was an awesome night.  Nice people.  Very friendly team.  The drinks and the bar area was very clean and organized  Decently recommend to come again for any party celebrate..."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, good atmosphere, clueless bartenders. Every time we come here though we have to get the staff to stop talking to each other for a new pour."}
{"text":"Sat down around 9:30 at a table in the back. We hunt down a waitress after sitting by the bar for 15 mins. We order 3 drinks, a pizza and a calamari. She brings us our drinks after another 15 mins, granted they were busy. After a few sips, the doouchebag army of bouncers comes 1 by 1 to each table telling everyone they have to get up because they are getting rid of the tables and chairs to make room for more people to be able to chill and drink. Then they come to us and tell us to get up, i tell them we just ordered food, guy says fine u still gotta get up and we will place u at the next table. The roided up doouchehoves a table in front of a giant 7 foot diamater fan that was blowing super hard. I wish i took a picture to show, but it was ridiculous.  so we got up and refused to sit down 2 feet in front of this tornado. So we get up, some random guy drops off the pizza and calamari at the table and we arent even sitting there. Waitress comes by and we tell her this is BS we already tried cancelling the order, we were forced to get up. Then she brings us our bill and it has the food on there. What kind of service is this? She brought us 2 free beers to make up for the rude treatment we got from the dbag army, not being able to eat our food....but she still expected us to pay for the food. At that moment i got really mad and i said, no way we are paying for thus, left $15 for the 2 drinks and we left. Horrible customer service, dont serve food somewhere with idiot bouncers if u cant treat customers with a little respect."}
{"text":"We were here for 3 hours. And bought out last round of drinks.. several hundred in we were told to leave our table so they could use it for a \"dance floor\". Seriously??? Why didn't you tell us that before we bought our last round??? Free money  and when we asked why we needed to give up our table we are asked to leave???  Really. We are grown people never asked to leave a bar... disgraceful. 8 security guards to the 4 of us???  Keep our money we have iit to spend and we will happily spend it somewhere else... never here again... disgusting.  Get your shi* together."}
{"text":"Everything was great until I got pickpocketed by some pros who pretended to be those drunk groups trying to get you to dance with their friend. Later found out it wasn't just me; another girl got her wallet stolen as well. They racked up thousands within thirty minutes. Bottled blond staff was indifferent. Boo"}
{"text":"Bartenders were amazing and fast. I had a great time besides the shit talking girl working at the front door. I would go back any day she is not working."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar... Service well below average. Great food, good drinks, just not very fast considering we were sitting in front of the bartender. Maybe just an off night...."}
{"text":"Normally I have a pretty good time at bottled as we always end up getting table. I have never had a problem until the last time I went about 2 months ago. I went to sign for my portion of the bill (to pay for the table) and someone ended up writing in a $60 tip after the fact! I disputed it with them and was brushed off to my credit card company. I disputed it with my credit card company and they ended up sending me the receipt that showed a tip written in when I didn't write one. So I'm out an extra $60 for someone that works there being greedy. Don't trust them to be honest and double check what you're being charged for and take a picture!!"}
{"text":"Music on point. Chicken, fries, and pizza on point. Dj and music on point. Enough tvs to watch the warriors win... this place is amazing!!! Only minus one star for waiting for service."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great drinks huge TV's ....my son says cute waitresses.  great food! Love it"}
{"text":"RACIST!!!! This place tagged my sister and I, while sitting at the bar waiting for our drinks, as being sloppy and spilling beer in their bathroom. My sister and I had walked in straight from another bar and hadn't even ordered a drink. Yet, when they saw us sitting at the bar and beer spilled in their bathroom, they automatically assumed it was us(the brown ones).  There was a multitude of people who it could've been, but NAH, they went straight for us. They approached us at the at the bar, when we were still waiting for our first drink, and accused us of spilling beer in their bathroom. We simply explained that it wasn't us and they could check their cameras because we hadn't even ordered a drink yet. Not even 10 minutes later, as soon as we had gotten our drinks(two beers), security came to escort us out. For what reason? We have no idea. We asked them time and time again, and all they said is we \"had to leave\".  So, fuck them and their bullshit establishment, I left. My sister stayed back to get her reimbursement on the drinks we had just ordered while the bullshit racist security, stared at me across the way. They refused to refund her card for the amount and eventually told her they had escorted us out for \"the way you ordered beers\". This place is a fucking joke, and if you enjoy it, Well, you're a joke as well. I can honestly say I'm disappointed in the people I came here with that stayed, after we were humiliated in such a way."}
{"text":"If I could make a review of none I would. We came to this right after a concert that was held at live wire.  We got one drink which was way overly priced.  I get it only young people who have their tuition paid by parents would go here, but we gave it a try and after standing in one spot and sipping on our drink we got escorted out. No explanation...nothing...when we asked for an explanation the guy just flashed the flashlight in our eyes and said good night...really?  It was just plain rude... Wow...there were three of us and one of us had zero to drink...I think we were escorted out due to the fact that we did not meet their age requirements I guess...if that was the case why were we let in the first place?  Why cause a huge scene that was not necessary?? And on top of it rude and un called for?  We were just looking for a spot after the concert to hang for a bit as I know there was other bars around,  but I guess this was not the spot.   I am really disappointed in the way the staff handled this and having people feel like they were profiled.  I guess if you don't fit the profile you get booted and that is what happened...I thought business was about money and tips from a customer but I guess they are above that.  We will spend our money elsewhere which is what we did..."}
{"text":"It's 100 degrees and the front guy doesn't let you in. Are you serious? We live in the desert"}
{"text":"$12 well drinks. Elbow to elbow. So loud you cannot carry on a conversation. If you're looking to be drowned out, grind on somebody and get spilled on: look no further! A wild Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a completely reasonable and rational person. It takes a lot to make me upset. I've worked as a server and a bartender in the past. This behavior is ridiculous and uncalled for.   This was what happened:  It was about 8:30 on Saturday. This was our first stop and the first drink I ordered. We had NOT pre drank. My buddy had purchased a round and the mixed drink he got was beyond weak for $8.   Then when I asked for a vodka sprite I watched the female bartender put barely a splash of vodka in my drink. The amount was def less than the standard amount. I politely asked her to add more vodka. She accused me of being wasted and told me she was going to charge me $16 dollars for a double if I wanted more vodka added. Her exact words were \"maybe you can't taste the vodka because you are so drunk!\" I clearly wasn't drunk or even buzzed at ALL. I kindly explained to her this was the first drink I ordered. She didn't apologize and caused such a scene that a person standing standing next to me who wasn't even with our group even said something. I couldn't believe she had that audacity to be so rude.   If I could do it over again I would have talked to a manager right at that moment.   It would have been different if I was drunk or was being rude, but I was being very sober, kind, and very reasonable."}
{"text":"People who hate cigarette smoke BEWARE!!! Riley provided our group playing Jenga AMAZING service for how busy it was! However, they consider the patio area to be \"outside\" so they let EVERYONE SMOKE. I personally CANNOT stand cigarettes and it makes for a very hostile environment when every Scottsdale Doucher is just walking around blowing cigarette smoke into everyone's faces. Never seen so many rude/obnoxious people who had ABSOLUTELY NO REGARD FOR WHERE there cigarette smoke went. I personally will not be coming back until they    change their smoking policy. I walked out of there smelling like I smoke two packs a day. Please change this rule about letting everyone smoke on the patio. They are the minority, not the majorly. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Came for a little New Year's Eve day celebration with a couple friends, not from the area. Bianca was awesome! Super helpful and sweet. Wish we had more servers like her in San Fransisco!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on Saturday to watch the final four games. The sound was played for the games which was a plus and a blonde bartender named Ashley told me they are a big sports bar for all major sporting events. She was so friendly and made the BEST margaritas. By the end of the day I came up with a nickname for her, Assley, cause her you know what was out of this world! Definitely going back soon!! Thanks Bottled blonde for a great time!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! So different from typical old town scene and they have games and giant jenga!!! Food is good with the pepperoni pizza being a little spicy but I like spicy so .  So many beers on tap!! Happy hour ends at 6!!"}
{"text":"This post is completely in regards to after work/HH 430-530 PM on a Thursday. Not the *night scene*:  Awesome HH! Got a glass of wine for $6 -- pinot noir, really good, on the menu for $10 a glass, so good deal. The pizzas are also all $6, we got the carnivore one, SO good (see pic). Person size, my boyfriend and I split it, although I could have eaten my own.  Not very many people here at this time even though there was NFL football starting. I'm sure it got more crowded after we left at 545."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time coming out to this bar and I had a good time for the most part. A lot of fun people passing good vibes, the music was good too! But the service sucked. The girls make the drinks very weak and seem to only pick and choose who they want to serve. If u stand at the bar for an hour they wouldn't even notice ur still waiting for  a drink. It's ridiculous... and very lame . It's a good place to vibe to, but hard to get served.    * go to Three wise men , the girls are all attentive on a busy night and u get served"}
{"text":"Great environment from the aesthetic to the staff itself. Always bring my friends here when they visit because it truly is one of the gems in Scottsdale. Make sure you try the garlic knots, they're a crowd fave!"}
{"text":"Called on a Thursday to make reservations for a group on a Saturday night. I was told I was all set and we'd have a table ready for us at 9pm that Saturday night. My girls and I show up at 9pm on the dot, and the hostess tells me that I don't have a reservation. She tells me reservations are only for people with \"bottle service\" and spending a minimum of $200. WTF? So WHY was I allowed to make a reservation in the first place?? The dense girl's response, \"I don't know.\" Obviously.  This is Scottsdale Arizona people. This is not Hollywood or Vegas. Get over yourselves! I was then painfully run into by some drunk dude and a drunk girl covered in glitter and possibly a bikini. Which means they are clearly over serving their patrons. :) We were outta there!  And in response to the comment left below from I am assuming a manager, it doesn't change the fact that you do not allow customers to sit down and enjoy themselves at a table without paying your establishment a minimum of $200. That is absurd. You advertise as a comfy, calm pizzeria type place, when really you are just typical Scottsdale. Over-hyped, over-sexed, over-priced and you value yourselves much higher than you deserve. Drink quality, food quality, and obvious customer service do NOT match your prices."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner there, got charged 50$ and then a separate 39$ when I had only done one of those charges.   Security kicked my out of a booth to let their friends sit there even though I was having a meal and drinks.   Needless to say, I'm out 39$ that I never even spent and will never be going back."}
{"text":"Great (newer) watering hole for Old Town Scottsdale!   Went this past Saturday night and yes, there was a line. But my group didn't wait which was all right w/me. Packed bodies made the place smell a little like hot roast beef, but whatever.  Drink prices were pretty much on par w/any venue in OT (higher).  I'd like to check this place out during the day, sober and try their actual food. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Absolute joke of an establishment. Wasn't permitted access to the bar after purchasing bottle service because I was wearing \"gym shorts\" short, bald security guard made sure his establishment was free from gym shorts on a 90° st Patrick's day night. Won't ever spend a dime here"}
{"text":"This is a racist fcukin bar!!! Me and my lady were on vacay and heard this place has nice food so we went there around 1am and these racist mo foz told me I could only get in if I was wearing skinny jeans which my pants wasn't nut huggers nor were they baggy. I was black trying to get in a white bar on the late night and they needed a reason to turn us away... #eZ"}
{"text":"we were in the area and saw the Chicago flags so we stopped in. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful and our bartender recommended pizza so we tried it. I got a double pepperoni and my boss got another pizza and some dry rub wings. The wings were very good!! Seasoned well and meaty! My pizza was so good! The crust was thin and flaky and the cheese was so good!! I was not expecting them to have good food so I was pleasantly surprised with the food!! I would come again for sure to get the pizza!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the place you want to go if you're into the club scene. My friends and I went here for a short time while we were exploring the area. If you don't buy bottles, you probably won't get great service here. We had showed up fairly early and taken a table with no problem, but as it got later, the bouncers were trying to find ways to get a member of our group kicked out so we would leave.   I get it, they're a business, but would have preferred them just to ask us to give up the table as opposed to being jerks and trying to get one of us kicked out.   3 stars overall as I didn't have a great experience, but if you're ready to drop cash for bottle service, you will likely have a good time here."}
{"text":"Once again my friends wanted to come here to my dismay. They don't let us in because someone is wearing \"high top\" sneakers. No dress code anywhere but they always want to turn people away because of random selections of clothing."}
{"text":"Happy hour. Live music, Cold beer. Very crowded. A mix of young and old, fugly and pretty.  Something for everyone. They have nice lounge seating and the decor is nice. I would recommend this place if you want to de-stress after work with your friends. Met a lot of people there that came quite a ways to be there. Pizza looked good. I didn't have any, my buddies reported it was better than expected. Plus, they are open earlier than some of the bars, so start here, finish down the block. And do not say I didn't warn you about the PO-PO. Take a cab when drinking on Whiskey Row."}
{"text":"We were a group of men/women, many visiting from overseas. Many of the men were dancing together on the dance floor, as is custom in many countries. The very \"ALL-WHITE BUBBA Bouncer\"s took issue with this and escorted all of us out. It is sad that the cultural acceptance and diversity is very lacking in this establishment. We felt very discriminated against. Note to self; if you aren't a Bubba, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst place I have been to in my entire life, and I've been to some real shit hole establishments.  Don't believe me? Don't really care....try it for yourself, and I guarantee you'll be disappointed; Im willing to put money on that!  Want more info hit me up....not scared to get real descriptive with it because it was atrocious from the door.  This place can't do much worse than its existing dismal reviews.... so my shitty review seems to coincide with the existing mass opinion that you will absolutely be wasting every penny spent here.  Don't do it...they don't deserve you're hard earned money and their pretentious attitude will leave you wishing you had just stayed home"}
{"text":"For food... Had the calamari, no good.  Tried the pizza, not great either. Not optimistic about other dishes.  For nightlife, what can I say. It's extremely fun but I think because it's new and in a fantastic location, and everyone gets tables there. But I can't see it lasting too long, there's nothing special about it. Feels like HiFi #2."}
{"text":"Just taking a moment to mention how much I enjoyed this place when it first opened... and now it's gotten even better. The food is awesome! Love the new additions especially the personal pizzas. I think because the atmosphere is so open and fun to watch sports at, the food is really underestimated. I've enjoyed going to other sports bars here in town, but this one is top of my list.  I would come early, best seats are at the bar looking over the patio at the action, but they fill up fast."}
{"text":"One of my fave bars in old town! Although getting a drink can take awhile which is to be expected, I always have a great time there!"}
{"text":"Dear Bottled Blonde, To whom it may concerns I would like to inform you of what's going on your Establishment. Today at 3:45 on 4/24 We just got done with brunch and wanted to continue the party so decided to come to your establishment. We're all familiar with Bottled Blond because there is one in Chicago where we are all visiting from. As we begin to enter, half of us walk in and when it comes to our friend Lexi, they say I'm sorry we have a dress code and there is a rule of no eccentric hair. We were not upset abut the rule since many bars in Chicago also have dress codes however imagine our surprise when we can visibly see a women with blue mermaid hair. So we say ok and walk across the street to The District we and obviously very upset about the situation we then see a man walk across the street with Leopard print hair and he walks right into your bar. I do not want place judgement on anyone working at your bar unlike then judgement that was placed on our friend but it's concerning to me that both of the patrons that were allowed to enter with \"eccentric hair\" we're both white and our friend is black. This does not sit well with any of us. It sends a very bad message that you can't enforce this rule if your going to let certain race in with eccentric hair and not the other! This may not have been the case however it is hard for us to wrap our minds around the facts and not come to the conclusion that race was the deciding factor. We are all industry, all sober and not allowing our entire party to enter over a rule that was clearly not being followed for everyone is baffling and very off putting. If I could I would attaching both photos of the women and their \"eccentric\" hair styles. Needless to say we will not be returning to your establishment in Arizona or back in Chicago as we wouldn't want to offend any other patrons with our eccentric hair or support a business that treats customers (only black ones of course) in an extremely inappropriate manner."}
{"text":"Wouldn't let my husband in because he was wearing Jordan's... what kind of stupid rule is that? Not to mention the security guard was super rude to my husband. Acting super arrogant and treating my husband like a dumba**."}
{"text":"Didn't go for Dinner but service was responsive and prices were reasonable. Beware, even on a Tuesday, this place turns into a dance club. People watching is epic and you get to meet some pretty interesting folks. Coming from Seattle, I have to say that everyone here is nicer. Maybe it's this establishment, maybe its the city or state... Had a great time."}
{"text":"Marissa was awesome!!! Came for a bachelorette party and she made sure we had a great time!!! Thank you Marissa! And Bottled Blonde!"}
{"text":"A few buddies and I flew in from around the country for a bachelor party. A couple of Latin friends weren't allowed entry for dress code purposes. When we asked them to specify, they said No athletic shoes. We then pointed out that other people were wearing athletic shoes. They then specified \"no Jordans\".   Seems like an arbitrary rule designed to keep out brown folks. Racism doesn't sit well with us. We don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was so trashy. Everyone was wasted and falling over. On top of that an employee pushed me as she was walking by. Disgusting lame place. Do not go."}
{"text":"This place is much larger than I expected and is a nice venue for meetings, mixers or medium to large groups. The pizza was good and the servers were prompt. Only issue is they need to show their gals how to pour a headless beer. I'm not a cheapskate but I didn't pay full price to get 1/2 a beer. Aside from that, parking is a bit congested but that's pretty much everywhere you go in old Town Scottsdale minus the summer months."}
{"text":"I've come here several times usually for brunch. I enjoy sitting on the patio especially during football season. There are tv screens where you can watch the games. I have had breakfast there which was yummy but I definitely would like to go back to try their pizza. I saw several people order the pizza while I was there and it looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Bottled Blonde is great for a few drinks, I really like their Moscow Mule selections. The pizza is really tasty and my boyfriend raves about their burgers!  I like the laid-back atmosphere and the staff was great both times I've visited. I would definitely recommend folks check it out."}
{"text":"Went here because there was a 10% off coupon on my ticket to Livewire (next door). The menu shows they have happy hour pizza and drinks. However, even though we were there in time for both specials the very rude bartender told us because it was final four this weekend that there were no specials so they could make more money. Pretty sure it's illegal to price gouge in AZ. I should have left when she said that. Our meal was mediocre at best.  We ordered a margarita pizza and a mushroom pizza. Both good both not something I would make the trip back for.  The ceasar salad was anything but. We still haven't figured out what the taste was. The croutons on the salad were fluffy bread burnt on a grill. Weird! When the bill came I almost fell over at the price for my Jameson and Ginger.  I'm from So Cal and am used to LA prices but this was seriously inane.  $10.19 for a high ball that tasted like there was maybe 2 drops of whiskey.  My bill even shows that I was charged 3% for what I'm assuming is a fee for using a debit card. This restaurant did have a nice atmosphere but that's about all it had going for it."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be giving the location that once inhabited the cesspool that was Axis/Radius (don't know if I spelled it right, and don't care) 4 stars, but times they are a changing...  I came here on a not-so-busy Thursday for HH, which is probably why my experience was a little more positive than others who've reviewed the place.   I liked the atmosphere. There's quite a bit of seating, and I like they large bar right in the center. Service was fine as well.  I came with a friend and we split an order of truffle fries & a pizza (honestly, I can't remember which one, but it was a veggie one since she's a vegetarian). They were both yummy! Pizzas are half off during HH (they're the only food deal that's offered during HH).   I also had a couple beers. I can't remember what the deals are during HH, but they do have drink specials. Bottled Blonde has a pretty good selection of brews, but for a place that actually promotes itself as a Beer Garden, I was expecting a little bit more. I can't think of anything they had that you normally couldn't find at a place that has craft beer on tap.   Overall though, I think this is a good, casual place for HH. I'm used to places offering more food deals during this time, but the pizza I had was delicious, and I can see why they really promote them.   It sound like this is a MUCH different place on a Friday or Saturday night (or Sunday Funday, perhaps), but for weekday HH, I like Bottled Blonde."}
{"text":"Left the deep eddies launch party, not drunk, and had some douche bag stop me as the sober driver and tell me I needed to leave. I grabbed my party of 5 and left. All I have to say, as a bar manager in old town, is give me a break. Learn how to do your job. My business is lost after that, and I will go out of my way to make sure that I spread the \"good word\" about their awesome actions. Thanks bottled blonde. You are dead to me and about 20 others that witnessed this."}
{"text":"The bar is pretty big, separated into different areas. The crowd is pretty young, but it's a good place to enjoy a quieter night from the typical Old Town scene."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check the place out. Really liked the look of the bar. The menu was ok. Nothing too extraordinary on it. 12 bucks for a small pizza. The pizza was good though. The waitress was very nice, but hovered over our table excessively. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back again, I would say the overall experience was average.  ."}
{"text":"Came here during MDW. It was crazy packed with good drinks and good looking people to match. The only con is that you can't wait in the hallway for the bathroom. Aside from that, I'd go here again!"}
{"text":"Watched the OSU vs IU here. A fun place to watch the game. Mostly OSU fans, but several other BIG showed up to watch the best team in the land!!"}
{"text":"If you come to bottled ask for Rachel at the bar. Not only is she gorgeous and sweetheart, but she makes killer shots!"}
{"text":"Need new non-racist security! Many guys going in with shorts and tennis shoes and I got in just fine but when my boyfriend showed his I.d. to go in, he was told he was not allowed inside because he was wearing sweat pants. He was wearing Nike pants with a nice shirt- we saw people going in before and after him with casual clothes. We were extremely disappointed at the racism."}
{"text":"Highly not recommend to come in to this place! Everyone should watch out for the giant fat security guy who got a big beard on his face! I should 've read the reviews before getting inside this place. Don't even bother to read the good reviews! Just like other guys said the security guard need to treat everyone the same. After I bought one drink and went to the bathroom, I realized the security guy followed me and watching me til I am done peeing. I were not even drunk at that time. He pointed at me and escorted me to the outside. In my whole life, I never got kicked out like this before without any explanations or something! I felt down and sad afterward then I went home! I were a happy guy and enjoyed my time off with friends and this big dude just observed me in the bathroom and kicked me out. This is freaking creepy as hell! I felt discriminated as a minority! I would never come back to this club ever again. If there a 0 star, I would be more than happy to give them 0 star! Goodbye and Never again!!! Please don't come to this club! The District right across the street is more fun and respectful! Make your money and time worthy!! :)"}
{"text":"Here for a night out with friends...dancing, laughing, and drinking...next thing you know, we are booted from our table because someone bought something called bottle service and \"bought our table\". I call that rude and we weren't asked nicely to leave. Poor way to do business if you ask me...all customers count if you are in the service industry!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome craft beer selection and a plethora of drinks to choose from... And wait for it... The food is amazing! And no I don't mean amazing for bar food. They genuinely have good food. I would recommend the meat lovers pizza sub bbq sauce for red sauce or the chicken panini. You can't go wrong with either and I personally enjoy a four peaks brewery kilt lifter."}
{"text":"Awsome burgers, and the staff is really friendly.  Managers moved our table because VIP wanted our table but the manager comped our next round of drinks."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Decent selection of beer, don't order mixed drinks they are watered down.  Food was good, but nothing special. I ordered pizza, the prosciutto was saltier than it should have been. It took away from the actual cheese and dough.  Service was decent, checked in on us frequently and got our drinks out promptly."}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with Bottled Blonde. This place gets EXTREMELY packed on the weekends, so if you can tolerate being bumped into incessantly and having your body pressed against strangers throughout the night, you might enjoy it. The bouncers are unfriendly and rude to say the least, with the exception of one or two. I comprehend that aggression is part of your job description, but lighten up a little, will you? I will say one thing though. The music is definitely happening, and when I'm feeling a little buzz, I thoroughly enjoy shaking my tail feather. However, if you're sober, this place can be a nightmare, so walk in at your own risk. Overall, I can tolerate this place in doses. This club attracts your standard Scottsdale crowd, so if you're all about that life, this is the club you should go to."}
{"text":"Okay...here's the deal with Bottled Blonde- this is like an awesome bar for your early 20's. However for my halfway to thirty (okay fine, a little closer than halfway) self, I've just well...outgrown it. I would prefer a more mellow place that's not as crowded and loud (god, I can't believe I just said that!). BUT here's how I would party here going forward:  Rather than waiting until 10 or 11 at night, I suggest you roll in after work and grab some pizza, drink and stick around for when it starts getting clubby. By then, you'll have a good buzz going.   I know what you're thinking, \"Why the harsh two star rating when you've admitted that this place just wasn't your style?\" Here it goes: what really bugged me was that someone shoved my friend out of the way while we were there. I turned around to see what bitch pulled that move and to my extreme horror saw that she was sporting the red hot shorts uniform. IT WAS AN EMPLOYEE!!! WHAT? How rude is that? I mean, I get it, my friend was D-RUNK and probably in her way but still. I would have complained to a manager but seriously it takes a hundred years to flag down a bartender, I can only imagine how much longer it would be to find a manager."}
{"text":"Partying at the Bottled Blonde made me feel young again.  Writing about it right now? Nothing makes me feel older.  Turning onto East Indian Plaza, I thought we'd stumbled onto the Las Vegas Strip as opposed to a downtown block in one of the top retirement cities in the country. It was - as the kids would say these days - lit.  (Spoiler alert: more embarrassing millennial lingo to follow.)   Maybe I just don't get out much anymore, but the people-watching here was the real-life equivalent to scrolling through the Explore page on Instagram. Not sure what I mean? Is that because your page is full of cute puppies and Bible quotes? Because most dudes here, their pages are definitely semi-naked IG models and dank memes. But let's be honest, it's mostly the IG models. The ones with the tight dresses, and high heels, and butt cleavage, boob cleavage, cleavage cleavage, and daddy issues, and guys from Dubai sliding into their DMs. In a nutshell, that's the clientele at Bottled Blonde - done-up party girls craving attention and a bunch of bros definitely giving it to them.  I report all of this from the safety of a roped-off VIP, where a group of us had bottle service, couches, space to dance, our own scantily clad waitress, and all the energy drinks our hyper-beating hearts desired. Basically, not like those other bro guys I mentioned at all.  But once we ventured past the ropes, the Bottled Blonde was essentially bedlam. Watching girls taking Snapchat videos while twerking on one another is amusing enough from the sidelines, but walking straight through a sea of that shit is a bit too real. There's a back wall by the bathrooms that might as well be bleachers full of sweaty bodies pouring out onto the dance floor. Should I have been a patron at this bar solely in the general standing room only area vs. our VIP table, I admit I may not have lasted very long here.  But instead, I had a blast. Sure, in hindsight, it's easy to be judgmental and dismissive and above it all. But in the moment, I embraced the cheesiness wholeheartedly and very drunkenly. That counts for something.  Bottled Blonde bills itself as a pizzeria-slash-beer garden. I didn't see any of that. I saw an indoor-outdoor, industrial club disguised as a bar and grill. The TVs were a steady stream of neon logos and blacklit bikini girls, and the music, a mix of EDM and the worst guest verses from otherwise half-decent, hip-hop songs. But with a bunch of Rockstar and vodkas in my system, I wasn't really sweating it.   Well, that and the dry desert heat helped. Great for perspiration control."}
{"text":"They REALLY need new staff. I went in with a couple of friends to get drinks a few times, the hosts that were at the front were kinda snotty and stuck up, the guys at the bar didnt look like they were even interested in serving drinks to us or others. We decided to order food, and they werent too bad but like i said before they really need new staff! The waitress that took care of us didnt bother to check up on us, she was snotty and acted cocky. I asked to speak to the manager, she said she would surely get him. We waited 2 hours! No manager, and no waitress!! Really?! I called later that day after we finished and a young lady answered and i asked to speak to a manager she asked what it was regarding, i told her a complaint and 2 minutes after she hung up. Come on.. so now ill just write a review on here. This place has decent food, but the staff there is what will be the death of them."}
{"text":"Just a heads up... This is NOT a typical beer garden scene, at least not after 8pm. The wife and I made our way here to grab a bite because we saw photos from a previous Yelp review that made it look like a chill, indoor/outdoor spot with some decent food options... Instead, we walking into a full blown lounge/club environment with a limited menu. We figured we would bear through things and ordered some meatballs (3/5) and garlic knots (2/5).   The four-star rating is based on them as a club, the servers and bar tenders were efficient, and friendly. Drinks were delivered quickly and service was very attentive. Security was very prevalent and actually very friendly compared to \"bouncers\" and \"security\" staff of similar establishments. My wife and I held a few fun conversations with them while enjoying our people-watching.  When my guy friends come to town and want to hit the town, Bottled Blonde will be one of our first or last stops."}
{"text":"Brought a group of dudes to Bottled Blonde on a slow Wednesday night and one of the group was given a hard time for wearing a tank top, he had no problem purchasing a shirt so they would let him in and as we were letting Zane head of security know he instantly raised his voice, started acting irate, and was a complete hot head. He let him buy a shirt and go in no problem  but it was kind of embarrassing  to be treated like that in front of a bunch of people... Been working with a lot of bars for a long time and have never been treated so poor especially when I just hand delivered customers. Zane is obviously unhappy and maybe he needs some training. Best of luck."}
{"text":"We enjoy going to Bottled Blonde to watch OSU games. It's fun and very spirited. I do wish it didn't have such a \"Scottsdale\" vibe, but that's probably too much to ask in the middle of Scottsdale. Always a great crowd for watching OSU games."}
{"text":"AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! Huge Shout Out to Frank!!  My friend left her purse (with cell phone, wallet, keys). After a week, she kept calling to try and track it down. Numerous people said they didn't find it. Finally, Frank was able to get a number off of her phone and call me to see if I knew her. Nice people do still exist! Thank you so much, Frank!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service and very rude employees. We went last night for dinner, and 3 male employees walked right by me and wouldnt even look at me or say hi, nothing. So very very rude. The service was really really awful too. We had to ask for everything about 4 times, at least. It took almost an hour for us to get silverware. This place is a joke. They do not  Have their shit together at ALL. And 1 of the bartenders had a pair of shorts on that were going all the way up her coochie, and her ass cheeks were hanging out, literally. It was really really disgusting. We will  definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Crazy thick with bros. Bros waiting in line, bros wearing sunglasses, bros eating things they ordered, bros talking to other bros about being bros. Place is straight BLOWING UP with ironic neon-frame sunglasses and v-neck tank tops. One bro drank a Corona, maxed out his xp and leveled up to Brobarian right before my eyes.  Wait staff was all hot chicks, none super interested in serving a group of 40-ish dudes. Can't say I blame them, but we bailed without even buying anything. This was the Sunday before St. Paddy's so they probably didn't miss the business. If you need a safe place to talk with your bros about that hag you nailed last night, this is it. Bring your neon shades."}
{"text":"Bartenders barley put any alcohol in my mixed drink. And the night life isn't so great here"}
{"text":"If you're anything like me, this is a great place to stand in a corner and inconspicuously look at all the eye candies on a weekend night. Then, after a couple drinks and a self-realization that the women here are out of my league and the guys in almost every physical way are better, I go home and eat tacos."}
{"text":"We gave this place a shot on Friday night. My roommate had really liked day drinking here, so why not?  We stand in line to get in. The first 3 of us are good to go. Then the \"bouncer\" refuses to let my boyfriend in. Why? Because he's wearing sneakers. Roommate's boyfriend got in wearing sneakers, no problemo. \"Oh, but his have his jeans over his tongues.\"  \"Ohhh-kay, I'll put my jeans over my tongues.\"  \"No man, you can't do that.\"  What the heck?   Roommate returns at this point with a friend that works inside, who waves the bouncer off and lets my boyfriend in.  Roommate and boyfriend pick a spot at the bar, get their drinks. I stand at the same exact spot and get told not once, but FOUR times by different staff that I need to move; first to the right, then back to the left, and repeat. Apparently you are in the way of the super special flowers that are the staff no matter where you stand.  $15 plus tip for a bottle of Coors Light and a Long Island (made with bottom shelf, plastic bottle liquor).   No dance floor. Constant \"bottle service parades\" of 5-6 people with strobe light wands got old real fast.  And then for the piece de resistance, we watched them  let in a bunch of guys wearing shorts, t-shirts and slip-on Toms type shoes..  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Fun place to go and watch the game but that's about it . Food and service are great but if you're looking for like more of a club scene , this isn't the place . Also the food comes out pretty fast and they have a lot of choices on the menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the inside outside concept of bottled blonde. You can have a chiller night and be outaide or be in the mayhem and dance by the bar.. on ocassiin there are go go dancera and the frequent crazy scottsdalean. But i have never had a bad night here"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here!! Please!!!! There are so many other great bars in Old Town, this one has become rundown and the staff is absolutely terrible.  This used to be my favorite bar, as my husband plays professional baseball and we would all get tables here... tonight I took my friend for 21st birthday, and one of the bouncers proceeded to tell me I was a \"cleat chaser\" and a \"typical Scottsdale blonde\", what that means I do not know and that if we didn't have a table we weren't welcome in the bar, as they \"weren't letting people in\".... but proceeded to let countless others in. I'm sorry  I guess the money we/teammates and friends have dropped in the place isn't good enough.  All I can say is, they really lost ALOT and I mean ALOT of business tonight by disrespecting me the way they did..... You will have a great time at the other many other bars in the area! Don't waste your time or money here. The new little guidos they have working the door, will wind up closing the place down. If you're from out of town or even around the area, do your research."}
{"text":"Woah! Did I just enter prison?!   First time visiting this bar/night club. I've heard lots about this place and finally thought we would give it a go since we had friends in from out of town & we were celebrating a birthday.   The crowd was chill.   Music choice good.   Bouncers/security aggressive and the worst I've ever seen. Nothing like getting yelled at fresh out of the ladies bathroom \"GET ON THE WALL\" um I had to look around  are these guys actually talking to guests Iike this?!   I get it. It's busy but that is extremely uncalled for and not classy. You're a bouncer not a police officer and no one was causing trouble. We were going pee!"}
{"text":"Terrible staff. Food was horrifying. I would not recommend for either drinks or food. I'm disgusted by the way the place smells and the staff was incredibly unprofessional.  I overheard extremely offensive slurs coming them. I would give ZERO STARS if I could."}
{"text":"One star only because I can't enter zero. This place sucks. The bartenders look bored and miserable. It's also all dudes. Maybe I wasn't the right gender? Sat at the bar for 5 mins and no one even made eye contact with me. Super lame."}
{"text":"If I could give this review negative stars, I would. I've been several times and its always a mediocre experience, but this past visit this weekend was enough to make me never attend again.   The bartenders were attentive and helpful, but the behavior and attitudes from security cancels that out. I understand the stress the bouncers may be under, but maybe the bartenders and cocktail waitresses shouldn't over-serve the customers. In the time that we were there, more than three people were escorted out and were covered in vomit. It was so disgusting and the place smelled horrendous. Security was constantly yelling at us that we were not allowed to stand anywhere and one of the bouncers purposely shoved me while I was walking to the bar and yelled \"YOU NEED TO KEEP WALKING!\" which was grand since I was trying to navigate my way through the overly crowded bar.  It's unfortunate that the staff is so disgruntled, but it's not fair for them to treat the patrons that are behaving and trying to have a good time and not get obnoxiously drunk in such a hostile manner."}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars i would.... they told my friend that he couldn't get in with J's on.... i watched them let men and women with flip flops and dirty sneakers on. I asked the other bouncer what the dress code was and he said no basketball shoes.... i proceeded to watch people walk in with all basketball shoes on. I won't say who's what color because I'm sure we all know. This establishment doesn't deserve my money and I won't refer any of my out of town friends or locals to go here either. What a shame. Smh."}
{"text":"Bottled Blonde is by far the best place in old town to grab a bite to eat and watch a game! The place is loaded with big screen, fun games, and the best pizza!"}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS AFTER GOING HERE!!! Apparently the bartenders just put whatever they feel like giving themselves after you leave!! From former reviews and my experience it is clear that Bottled Blonde has NO ETHICAL STANDARDS and DO NOT care about your business! I will not be returning and I will pass the word along."}
{"text":"Bad service and awful bouncers. The games are fun but let's be honest, not worth it. You won't see me again. Go somewhere else. Need something else convincing? Just look at the rating. Changing my review to two stars so people don't think I'm just upset. Let's be honest, many people get bad service and instantly the place instantly becomes one star to them. I'm not that guy."}
{"text":"Everything is a little pricier in Old Town, but that doesn't mean you can't ball on a budget. Go and get a Bud Light bucket and some apps and you'll be good to go.   Plus, there's a giant blonde lady on a bottle on the ivy wall. There's a solid chance you'll get caught staring at it throughout the night. On the weekend, this place is packed.   You'll find a very eclectic group of people here, including, but not limited to: the guy who wears a basketball jersey out to the bar so you can see his tats and muscles, the guys who look like they just got out of a business meeting but that doesn't stop them from being obnoxious and getting bottle service for themselves, the girls who just want to dance, the girl who only came to drink the business guys' bottle service vodka, a Pitbull lookalike, and me...because I'd be there again."}
{"text":"Went here for the Michigan-Ohio State game last weekend.   I've been here before during the night way too many people which is good thing for business bad thing for folks who prefer less crowded bars.  But they went ALL OUT for the game being from Columbus and the Buckeye fan that I am I appreciated it. Apparently this is a Buckeye bar which I know now and will definitely be back for some games next year.  They had the whole street blocked off with a band and the game on what seemed like 4556465 tv's along with a big screen above the stage showing the game it was really really good time.   Crazy that this was 9am and it was crowded full of Buckeye fans with some unfortunate Michigan fans here and there that somehow made it out unscathed that would NOT have happened in Columbus lol   But enough about the Buckeyes...   The bar itself is pretty big they had a few bars set-up outside if you been to the Ghost Ball or the other block parties they have down there between Bottled Blonde and Maya you'll already know how it's set-up.  Haven't tried their food yet but walking to the restroom look at others food it looked really good. I'll have to check it out during the day for happy hour or something.   Definitely a nice place but if you don't like big crowds stay away on Friday and Saturday nights.   Oh and one more thing folks seem to overlook in all their reviews Bottled Blonde has FREE WIFI haha"}
{"text":"A few of my friends and I were on a trip and decided to stop at Bottled Blonde for a few drinks (during the day). Since we were visitors of the area, the bartenders were so friendly and easy going to chat with! Not only did they give us exceptional service, but invited us back to the bar later that night. Unfortunately, my friends and I didn't make it out that night, but the bartender, Jillian, was the one who went out of her way to make us feel welcome and invite us back!   Great drinks, good prices, inviting & fun environment."}
{"text":"Went for Ohio State game on Saturday and loved this place.  Great layout and open floor plan. Really fun for the game - jello shots on every score, and Cincinnati chili and buckeye balls for food.  The service was excellent, especially given the crowd. I would totally go back."}
{"text":"Yesterday around 3 PM, a group of my friends and I headed to Bottled Blonde AZ. A friend who is a woman of color approached security first, showed her ID, and then stepped in the door and to the side to wait for us. I was next in line, and by the time I could say a word to the bouncer he had turned around and was demanding that she leave, saying that she was \"over-intoxicated\" because she did not go straight into the bar once she entered. We all explained that she was simply waiting for us, but he continued to berate her and tell her she was not permitted. We of course all left at that time.  Shortly after, I called in to explain the incident to management. We identified the security guard in question, and I was told by the manager that he would review the security tapes and get back to me. I asked how long this would take, and he immediately got defensive, telling me that they were very busy and he didn't know. I asked if he saw issues such as this as unimportant, and he hung up on me. Another friend soon called in to ask about the incident, only to be told that there were no security guards fitting that description (even though he had just identified him when speaking with me), and again hung up on us. I also called the District Manager afterwards, but have yet to hear back. While all of us thought this was a racist act, I was hoping for another explanation. After a quick search on Facebook, Yelp, and Google however, I found that racism is clearly a persistent problem Bottled Blonde AZ.  The excerpts in the photo are only a portion of the complaints. Any responsible business owner would immediately respond to these comments, and do what they can to correct the situation, but Bottled Blonde has not responded to a single one. This proves that they are complicit and even condoning this bigoted behavior. It is absolutely disgusting that a popular local business can continue to operate on such discriminatory policies. I don't normally get political or opinionated on social media, but when a thriving business is so clearly in the wrong, it would be irresponsible to stay silent. I hope that enough attention can be brought to this issue for a change to be made."}
{"text":"Our beach cruisers got stolen right in front of \"security\". Two bikes taken while the security guards said \"yeah they looked like hoodrats\", yet didn't do anything to stop them. Great job, ya'll."}
{"text":"A fucking hell hole. Disgusting old men and seemingly classless people. Music is so loud you can talk to the person next to you, and the servers are completely indifferent to your existence. The best thing about this place is that they didn't charge a cover, so my friends and I could happily leave after fifteen minutes of attempting to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Came here for a bowl game.. security was so rude and pushed everyone around all night. They were insistent that everyone was such a bother with an overcapacity bar. Horrible service and security. Not a great bar for the price."}
{"text":"Get some heat lamps for outside!  It's freezing out there.  Also, maybe knock a wall down or expand the patio.  Crowded in here.  People kept bumping into me.  Not fun."}
{"text":"The setup is like the other spots around the town with a few twists.  One they have two bars to go to in case it gets real busy which it looks like it does and second the whiskey selection.  May not seem like a lot there but what they have is really good like Macallan, Blue Label, Louis 13.  Cool spot, I am sure the weekends it gets really busy and will be a lot of fun.  The staff was quick to serve us and everyone that walked by kept checking on us.  Will be coming back on the weekend to experience it in full."}
{"text":"Not happy about my few experiences at this bar. This place gets way too crowded at night, they need to cut off how many people they allow into the bar. It is like being packed inside a sardine can, I have been injured by heels multiple times and I cannot even count how many drinks have been spilled on me due to the mass amount to people inside trying to move about. The only reason I even stepped foot in this place again was because I had a few drinks beforehand, so I did not think much of it. Lastly, I have permanent hearing loss in one ear due to this place, the music was insanely loud, and I am not just being wussy, I can handle loud noise. Every minute or so the DJ would play this obnoxious horn sound that was 2 times louder than the music. Needless to say, will not be returning here. You do not need to deafen your customers!"}
{"text":"Super fun spot great music and lots of energy if you're visiting and want to have fun!!!"}
{"text":"We came here yesterday for Sunday Funday with a group of about 11 friends.  All we wanted to do was enjoy our afternoon, watch the games, and grab some food/drinks.  We sat in a couch area to your right as you walk in....a server came up pretty quickly, but had a horrible attitude.  She was super irritated right off the bat.  She asked how many there was going to be in our group and if we were wanting separate checks.  When we answered yes, her irritation level skyrocketed.  I asked her to just let me know whatever it is she wanted us to do in order to make the process easier, but she just kind of rolled her eyes and never even answered me.  As this was all happening....another member of my group had asked an employee to change one of the tv's that no one was watching (because there were no seats on that side of the bar) to a specific game....and she was told that they couldn't.  After them not being able to change the game (we weren't asking for sound, just for picture...and weren't interrupting anyone else's game) along with the attitude from the server (who I later found out her name was Libby).....we got up to leave.  As we were heading out the door, the bouncer and hostess asked why we were leaving.....in which the bouncer replies that there's no problem in changing the channel.  I still didn't want to go back in, because the server, Libby, was not someone I wanted to give my business to if she wasn't willing to even help us out.  You should never act that way towards your guests....especially when there are so many other options for us....and the competition has even better specials (and food/drink in general).  We weren't being rude or obnoxious.....it was still pretty early, we were trying to help her.  I decided to go back in with the rest of my group and luckily we got a different server...Bui...and she was awesome.  She was nice, helpful, did separate checks for us without an irritated roll of the eyes or comment.....an overall great server with a smile.  I watched Libby continue to serve her other tables, and she never smiled.  Not the type of person I want to have helping me out.  Had a great time there, because of the group I was with, but aside from the bouncer and Bui (who were awesome) the service and food totally lack.  I won't be back there by choice."}
{"text":"Lol at all the bad reviews this place is a great atmosphere with gorgeous people- yes they don't want dudes who look like inmates in there .. the decor is awesome and the girls well it's Scottsdale there  who ever owns this place and the one in Chicago We'll done"}
{"text":"I've never written a Yelp review, but this place was terrible! The most racist place I've ever been in my life. They purposely bumped into and escorted me out each time I've been there (twice!). Each time the same bouncer gave me a dirty look as I entered and left: once when I was escorting my friend to her uber and next when I was just mildly dancing with some friends. DO NOT GIVE THESE GUYS YOUR BUSINESS. He even said, \"You better get out of my F***ing face!\" as I was walking between him and my friend when he was literally pushing her to the exit. These guys are incredibly terrible, while I gave them business. I've never experienced such cruelty in my life."}
{"text":"This is what you will experience here.  I was visiting some friends in Scottsdale from out of town and after a day of business I attended Bottled Blonde on July 9th 2016. It was a little after midnight and the establishment was extremely overcrowded by the time I got there. I went to purchase some beers at the front entrance and accidentally (because of overcrowding) ended up slightly outside the front door. I was than confronted by the front door bouncer who assault and battered me by grabbing my hand and my personal beers that I just purchased for me and my friend. An altercation occurred and about 5 bouncers took me down to the ground. While I was on the ground they kicked me in my head, ribs, stomach, kidneys, they jumped me like I was a gang member (I am a Tennis Professional). They proceeded to handcuff me and laid me down on my stomach, \"Hog tie\" style. I begged them not to break my shoulder, which one of the bouncers stated, \"I'll break whatever I want\". They physically broke my left foot with their hands. I got a bad concussion, rib contusions and a broken left foot. I ended up suing them in Federal Court for injuring and almost killing me. I missed work and lost out on numerous business opportunities as a result. The city of Scottsdale retaliated (because I also sued them) and filed bogus misdemeanor criminal charges against me in state court. Apparently they tried to file felony charges against me, but the felony charges wouldn't stick, so they settled on misdemeanors. As I've been doing my research I've come to find out that this is standard procedure for not only bottled blonde who injures it's patrons, but police departments and cities like the city of Scottsdale who condone the violence of security guards and collude with local businesses such as bottled blonde in an attempt to stifle anyone who dares to stand up for themselves. I was injured. I lost work. I can't sleep well to this day. And instead of taking responsibility for their actions, they are lying and trying to paint ME to be the bad guy! They are attempting to bare false witness against me as I write this review.  Anyone who was there that night please message me, I have some questions for you. Anyone who had a bad, racist experience there, message me. I need to talk to you."}
{"text":"I'm mad rn cause the security told I could not go in because of my jeans, because the dress code, I'm not coming back that sucks."}
{"text":"My friend ordered bottle service here for his birthday.  I'm not sure how much he spent on it, but I felt that it wasn't worth it.  The place was soooo crowded that it was difficult for them to find us our own designated space.  And even when we did get a tiny alcove, it was super cramped and our group couldn't really stand together and hang out.  On top of that, the bar is an \"outdoor\" bar so there were smokers galore blowing smoke in our faces :( bleccchhhh.  We requested to move to a different spot because of the smokers, and I will give credit to the bar bc they were happy to oblige.  EXCEPT when we moved, our new spot had even MORE smokers!  After choking on that rotten air for about 30 min I was done and ready to head home."}
{"text":"Wow!  I wasn't let in because I was wearing the wrong kind of shoes. They said my nikes were too nice. What crap.  Won't ever go to that place again. One star is too generous."}
{"text":"We went here with some friends and had  lot of fun, but we have a lot of fun where ever we go. The guy to girl ratio is totally in favor for the girls.  We got bottle service and our table was close to the outside of the club facing the sidewalk. It was fun to people watch at the very least. They really don't try to keep the area you have clear, which is kind of ridiculous since you're paying for the table and the service isn't great. They bring by flashing lights when you get a new bottle then put a lock on top of it, so you can't pour your own drinks. I have clue how much drinks are or how much the bottles were, but overall, the club is nice and has a small dance area. They have  attendants in the bathroom, but that doesn't mean they're clean. They're pretty gross, actually. Maybe I'm too old for the clubs. haha"}
{"text":"They deserve zero stars. Horribly run establishment with even worse security. Never again."}
{"text":"This place was a lot different than what I expected it to be.  I expected a lot of fists flailing and d's running around trying to grind their overly cologne'd stink up on the ladies in bandage dresses.  Luckily, it was not that.    I felt like this place had more of a feel of like, a more upscale/hip Majerle's.  Huge TV's, hot chicks working the bar and overpriced drinks.  A captain and coke and a greyhound were $19.  Did someone say, \"$9 beer night\"?! :-p  Overall the atmosphere is actually pretty cool - they have a giant moving cut out, pinup girl that hangs over the bar.  Talk about something to catch your eye.  We went fairly early so it was only around 8-9PM...the later the night got the more drunken guys fled the bar.  Dude's next to us dumped/broke their drinks all over the place, guys determined to play the skiball with my friend and I just trying to suck at the game without any assistance.  But hey, it's a bar can't expect anything less right? ;)  The outside is actually a really cool set up and the multiple bars are a great touch.  It's a great spot to check out I'd definitely recommend popping in while you're out :)"}
{"text":"Let me first start with I NEVER have an opinion on racial stereotyping. BUT, I'm Only giving one star because I HAVE to. Came to Arizona with 5 people, went to this bar with 4 other friends, I had a dress on, my husband had flip flops and 3 others ALL had sneakers on. They ONLY stopped the one black dude with dreads and said he wasn't allowed in due to standards, although the two before him had on very similar shoes. Coming from the Bay Area, I'm blind to color, but it's clear that this place was NOT. Very unfortunate to experience while bouncers from near by places validated our concern."}
{"text":"I went here with friends late Saturday afternoon. It was a nice calm crowd with fair amounts of seating and good music. I got the truftor fries with the garlic aioli and they were so good we got a second order!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at this bar. Our waitress Bianca, did a phenomenal  job! Food, drinks, and service was great! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I had some of the best service I've had any where. Every one of the staff went out of their way to make me happy, and they did so with a smile. I will be sure to stop in every time I'm in town. Thanks AJ and crew."}
{"text":"Michelle M, Ginger O, Amanda B and I walked over here in search of sustenance. We had all just consumed copious amounts of whiskey at the Cocktail Society (I'm assuming they did, anyway, because I did). We needed to eat!  Bottled Blonde was the opposite of what I'd call \"my kind of place.\"  It was, in fact, NOT that.    Waitresses in skimpy clothing, check.  Music played just a smidge too loud, check.  Margarita pizza with rubbery cheese, cardboard-flavored crust and bland sauce, check!  The service was fine. The tables were clean.   I won't be back here, but there was nothing wrong with it.   Meh."}
{"text":"Eh. Nothing bad to say nothing good. Service, was very average, drinks were average, and the bar was packed. No where to sit, no where to stand, but other than that it's fun to check out. Just buy a few drinks somewhere else because of the high prices."}
{"text":"I left my CC inside and asked to come back in after i left to close it and they said come back tomorrow. I'm leaving on a plane 7 am and they are not open.. rude as hell"}
