{"text":"The space is operational. That declaration says a great deal. Not many 'deli's' are able to be declared operational. The Family that runs/owns the place are first and foremost intelligent, and as such have shaped their business to reflect a niche within the community. Sam's is many things -- a sports bar (well done renovation!), a pool hall, a place designed to cater to a variety of desires and demand (IE that a large, casual group may require), a Sunday brunch location (excellent one, given the cost), a one-on-one meeting place... they really understand community. Although the design of the place may appear 'chain-business', that is far from the actual case. Rather, the appearance of Sam's indicates the dynamic range of what type of 'business demands' the owners are prepared to respond to. Instead of pulling the 'niche' marketing interior design, Sam's has evolved (as any community business will) to accommodate multiple business scenarios. To sound a touch academic, Sam's is a fine illustration of why R Buckminster Fuller stated that humans expressed their best potential because, as a species, they were the ultimate (metazoic) generalists (see: Critical Path)      This business will not specify its abilities -- it doesn't need to. They are sincere with what they will do. Their brunch is more than fine. Top-attention paid by whosoever is working. Their beer selection is an expression of what the community drinks -- ditto their range of spirits and wines. Many food items indicate what locals demand, and some menu items indicate what the family has pride in. For example, their Borscht is in the running for the best borscht you can order in Calgary. It is specific to the culture and geography, yet I would put it up against any other borscht in town (outside of making it from scratch).      The people involved in the business deserve full stars. So much patience, sincerity and local accommodation. I cannot describe in a short review how these people really are the foundations and the capstone of their business. If you want to experience what Hillhurst-Sunnside is like, check out Sam's quite a few times. No visit will be like the other, yet you will notice a 'sameness' (community) running through each event. Trust me. Good times. Good neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had in Calgary.  The patio was full, but only a few tables on the inside.  We sat at a dirty table for 20min before anyone even acknowledged us or cleaned the table.  The draft tasted skunky, like the lines had not been cleaned in a very long time.  After we got our nasty beer we then waited an additional 20 minutes without anyone coming by to take our order.  Thinking the service might be better inside, we moved from the patio.  After our order was finally taken, we were then not attended to again until our food came.  The waitress, Karoly, brought us the wrong food and then was snotty with us for wanting what we had ordered.  The food had also clearly been sitting under the lamp for quite some time, as the fries were lukewarm and the lettuce on the burgers wilted.  The waitress was rude, slow, and talked on her cell phone more than addressing customers.  The manager ended up comping 2 of our meals after we complained about the terrible lack of service we had recieved, but it wasn't enough to make me ever go back."}
{"text":"This place was kind of charming when it was a dive-ish bar that had cheap bottles and a colourful and very diverse crowd.  Then they renovated.  It looks like any dull uninspired sports bar. Usual pub food. Flat screen tvs along the wall. Rectangular bar in the center. Pool tables to one side. Dance floor on the other. Patio out front between the establishment, a sidewalk, and angled parking. But no need to fear, the same diverse crowd is still here.   Oh, and $6.50 stellas. Meh.   Barkeeps are interesting and fun but nothing really special."}
{"text":"I'm headed to Phoenix this weekend so I'm spending this week getting together with as many peeps as possible before I jet.  Last night I met up with a couple of friends at Sam's. I had never been and although apparently it used to be quite the dive, they've done a good job of modernizing it. It's got a contemporary feel to it now (with black and silver being the primary colours of decor) and the staff is super friendly.  Plus, I was perusing their menu and their Sunday Brunch (Sundays from 10am-2pm - all you can eat for $14.99) has quite the assortment!  And speaking of assortment, their regular menu also has quite the variety. Everything from your standard bar snacks such as poutine, potato skins and calamari, to restaurant grub such as hummus, piadinas and lasagna. Plus for those of you who don't have to watch your waist line (I curse you), definitely try their deep fried cheesecake. It looked amazing (that's right - for me it's a 'look but don't touch' kinda thang).  Overall, a great pub to have in town.  If you weren't a fan because of their old-skool digs, then definitely give them another shot. Everyone deserves a second chance, don't they?!?!?!"}
{"text":"A great local watering hole. I have found myself down here for many occasions, mostly Sunday brunch and lazy afternoon patio sesh.   Their weekend brunch is awesome! Tons of selection and always fresh. And I've yet to see it crazy busy, so you are able to show up whenever and will get a seat and service.   They have a large open patio with comfy chairs and couches and plenty of sun! Great for people watching or just kicking back and enjoy a drink or two."}
{"text":"I find myself having to visit Sam's in Kensington for meetings for volunteer orgs. I've never had the chance to try their menus but people in my table don't seem to have any complaints.  Their beers selection and price is average. I've ordered a few pints here and have little to no complaints.  Average pretty much describes the place. It has a sports bar feel but they do have an open mic night on occasion. They do have a nice outside patio where you can watch some interesting people walk by, or stupid people drive against the one way street, impatiently stalking passerby in hopes of landing a parking spot. Park farther and walk FOOS!!"}
{"text":"Sam's Bar & Grill is an oft overlooked pub-style restaurant in Kensington.  Located next to Molly Malone's, it has developed somewhat of a reputation for being a dive.  Recent attempts to change this include new staff and a newly renovated decor.  Enjoy the formal introduction?  Truth is, Sam's was my local watering hole for just over 3 years after first moving to Calgary.  The location is huge, which is great for big groups and on busy nights.  Unfortunately it's also the downfall, as 30 people in a location this big tends to look sparse.  The food is reasonably priced and consistently good.  I mentioned the renovation in my introduction.  The reno was massive, both structurally and aesthetically, so if you haven't visited it since the reno I would strongly recommend taking another look.  The decor is much nicer - classier - and there have been some improvements in the type of customer frequenting the bar.  One more great advantage of Sam's is the lack of violence.  Having spent several (SEVERAL) nights in Kensington across multiple bars, things can get out of hand very quickly.  Sam's is fortunate in that they don't have doormen, and ultimately don't need it.  All said, Sam's is a great place to share some drinks and foods with a few friends, or many.  Note: Delivery is provided via Waiters En Route (http://www.waitersenroute.ca/web/index.php)."}
{"text":"After wandering around the Salsa Festival for a couple hours, the kidlets were ready for a rest and possibly something better to eat than chips & salsa and the snacks we had packed.   Suffice to say we were disappointed to find out very few places with outdoor patios would allow kids in (even if they were a restaurant) for something to eat.  Fortunately Sam's took our kids in with open arms and gave us outstanding customer service.  The kids shared an order of chicken fingers & fries.  We had wings.  Just enough to get us through another hour or so until it was time to leave.  The chicken fingers were huge and the fries very tasty.  The wings were a decent size and also quite delicious.  The waitress was there whenever we needed her and very friendly.    We were so grateful to find somewhere that catered to families so the kids could take a break.  The Salsa Festival had so many things for kids to do but they didn't take into consideration places for kids to sit and rest, or have snacks.  At least Sam's did.  We will be back to Sam's...they've won us over with good food and good service!  Plus I've heard the brunches here are very good :)"}
{"text":"Good prices on food and drink, but not great food. Had fish & chips and perogies, all terribly overcooked. Friendly service, but unsteady...probably could use more staff."}
