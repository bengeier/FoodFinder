{"text":"Fabulous little lunch stop! Loved my sandwich! I am sad I just found out about it! I could have been going here all last year!"}
{"text":"The owner of this business is a total asswhole. Terrible service and terrible food. The cheese tastes like shit. The prices are ridiculous and the food isn't worth it at all. All in all I would say don't go there you'd be better off going to little ceasars."}
{"text":"Got a pulled pork sandwich today. Service was fast, the guy was very friendly, and the food is super yummy! I was happy with the price for my meal. I would recommend this restaurant."}
