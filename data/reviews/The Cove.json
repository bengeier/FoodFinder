{"text":"It's OK but is not good compared to local fish and chip joints or local bar/restaurants. The food is mediocre but the price sure is right."}
{"text":"l was worry at first because it's located in a very old strip mall, but as soon as l walked in, the worry disappeared. super friendly owner and staffs, pretty good fish and chips, awesome seafood chowder, love the price"}
{"text":"Good priced food. Terrific service. Stay away from the bar area as a couple of the older patrons tend to urinate themselves every so often. This establishment would be more prosperous with a different clientele."}
{"text":"The Cove has fantastic traditional fish n' chips. I especially love the crab cakes..    The service and atmosphere is great. My only wish is that we didn't live so far from it or else we'd be there more often."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place through Kijiji.    Why would I look for a restaurant at Kijiji? Because I did not, as the ad for this restaurant on Kijiji included keywords completely unrelated to this place and mucking up the search for things I'm looking for.  Really hate ads trying to get hits by using unrelated keywords at the bottom.  I hope this place smarts up on how they advertise."}
