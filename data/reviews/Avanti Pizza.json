{"text":"I tried Avanti Pizza for the first time, and i was amazed how good the pizza's were.  Of all the years I've been eating Pizza from (Pizza hut, Domino's, Papa John's) this is the place i prefer coming back for more.  You can tell that is freshly made which makes the food even better.  The thin crust pizza is what i like best, less breading but more toppings compared to other pizza joints that after a few bites you're already full.  If you haven't tried this place yet call in for carry out or for delivery.  I think they have this promotion  right now that is a buy one get one free witch is a good deal for a good pizza, why not get two for the price of one...Price is little high but its worth it. i give this place 10/10. Great atmosphere, great staff, and good food!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza ever! Just moved here and there are so many places to choose from. We tried this place because they have Chicago pizza and my husband grew up in Chicago. The owner came out and introduced himself and said we will love this pizza, and we did! I can't wait to go back!  You will love this place! Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Good flavor and GREAT service! I wish the crust was crispy and veggies cooked more under cheese. Next time I order I will request well done pizza. May be the only factor. Plus it was almost close so perhaps it was lightly cooked for that purpose. I will go bak!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good.  Better than the vast majority of pizza in Vegas.  Lunch special is off the hizzy.  Under 6 bucks for a personal pizza and a 22oz bottled drink.  Plus, I saw another sign that said \"get $3 off any regular pizza if you check in on Yelp.\"  So, you know, I'll be taking advantage of that in the near future.    Hit the spot.  Nothing bad to say about this take-out pizza joint."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza at Avanti.  I have had this before when family members ordered it and it is possibly the best in Las Vegas.  Carry out or delivery only but if they had destiny inside we might never leave.  Can't wait to get this one home!!  :)"}
{"text":"I live close by so I thought Id try it. I got a personal pizza and it was a great thin crust. Since they claim to be Chicago style pizza tried it again with some friends from Chicago and ordered a deep dish. Very dissapointed. Very bready and really not worth the price. More like a loaf if bread with toppings. They are good for regular pizza but thier Chicago disappoints and is def not wirth the extra cost."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Great timing! Great food! Hot and fresh! I definitely recommend everyone contacting these guys!"}
{"text":"This pizza is all the way on point!  Make sure to call in early so your wait time is minimal. I had the meat lovers and I was very much satisfied!"}
{"text":"First time in. Ordered online and food was ready on time. Very friendly owners. Had the pastas which were  large portions for the price. Food was very good. will definitely order again from here."}
{"text":"Not sure what the food tastes like as I waited for over a hour for the pizza I ordered and the delivery guy gave it to someone else at the hotel we were staying at. Not good."}
{"text":"So glad we found Avanti Pizza.  We had our pizza delivered and our delivery person Thomas arrived right on time with a piping hot pizza.   Ordered the Chicago Style Deep Dish with Pepperoni and it tasted so good!!  Finally found our pizza go to place.  Thank you Avanti!"}
{"text":"Deep Dish Pizza is tasty.  Just way too much!   Delivery was very fast.  And pizza was stalking hot! mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the Vegas area. The sauce, crust and toppings were amazing on the Chicago style deep dish and the calzone was off the hook as well. The owner is right in the back making these pizzas and loves talking with the customers. Wonderful customer service and you can order off Eat24, it's super simple. If you want great pizza check them out."}
{"text":"I was searching for lunch with a friend and we noticed this place close by work. At the last second we turned into the parking lot to check it out.  I was excited to try something new until I walk in and realize it is not a sit down restaurant.  We ordered anyway and decided to take the food back to the office.  They have a great priced lunch special menu that we ordered from.  I got the half sandwich with fries and a drink. My food was just OK and they do not have fountain drinks. The lunch special was the perfect amount of food for me though. The customer service was great! Too bad the food wasn't. Maybe next time I'll try the pizza."}
{"text":"We love their double decker pizza! They are always spot on when they give the pick up time. 3rd time back and no complaints. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"***HORRIBLE SERVICE*** ***DO NOT EAT HERE*** we got a call from the pizza place at 8:15pm, when I answered no one said anything. I said hello 3 times and no one said anything. I hung up & then someone rings my door bell 4 times while my kids are in their rooms. I could understand maybe 2, but 4 times?? My husband answers the door & the guys says, \"What? Are you sleeping? You must not want your food.\" I then told him I answered the call but no one said anything so I hung up. He began to ARGUE with me saying he wasn't going to give us our food. When he finally did give our food, he kept his rude attitude & gave me a \"thumbs up\" like he could care less what I had to say. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! WISH I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO!!! Don't worry dude, we wont order from you guys again."}
{"text":"Had the deep dish and thin crust pizza and both I recommend. I personally loved the deep dish,sauce and cheese was a perfect mix and you can tell sauce is homemade. Definitely your neighborhood pizza joint and when I'm in the neighborhood I will be coming back for some more."}
{"text":"Lunch special prices are great, but the food was just so so to me. I got the half meatball sub special. It came with just meatball marinara on bread, no cheese. I didn't know cheese was extra. The bread was soft and a little soggy by the time I got back to the office literally 5 minutes away. The meatballs didn't taste too good, they kind of fell apart as I picked them up. The fries were good but nothing spectacular. I also ordered the mozzarella stick appetizers, which are usually good anywhere. These were good, but again, nothing special. Basically the same kind you can get at Arby's. Also, there are no tables for indoor sitting, just a couple of benches along the window and wall like you would find at pizza hut. So unless you are planning on taking the food to go, it's a good point to know. Even though the prices were good, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Fiance had the lasagnua said it was awesome Plus garlic bread is way better now good job guys"}
{"text":"Fantastic thin crust.  For sure my top 5 ever.  Being a Chicago native, I'm a pizza snob and very picky.  Always hard to find great pizza out west.    The owner Angelo is very personable and knows his stuff.   Good customer service in this take-out pizza parlor.   Highly recommended.    Can't wait to try the stuffed/deep dish."}
{"text":"Toppings, Toppings, Toppings!  If you enjoy a mischevious amount of toppings on your pie.  This is the place.  And a pie is what you'll get.  I'm serious. After eating here you'll start start referring to toppings as fillings.  Avanti has become my splurge place.  If I'm craving something completely decadent, this is where I go.   Still, as far as taste goes that really depends on who's in the kitchen.  I wouldn't call it hit, or miss, but there is probably a 20% differential regarding flavor.  Yet, it evens out, because the better cooks are indifferent older men who come off as being slightly creepy/malicious.  It's almost worth taking a small hit in taste in order to not have to deal with their cold stares."}
{"text":"Their pizza should be renamed to the \"cheese bread pie\" as it was literally the most dense bready crust ive ever had in a pizza, almost like a lasagna, but as a pizza. Now this might sound good, but the pizza crust had a distinctly frozen premade pizza crust flavor that was almost identical to red baron or tombstone frozen pies, chewiest pizza ever. I wanted to like this, as they took over Rosati's which I love, but this does not compare, at all."}
{"text":"Wanted Pizza and wings so we ordered through Yelp (which was so easy!) It arrived pretty quickly and was good. The only downside was everything seemed a little chewy but that won't stop us from ordering again."}
{"text":"Had the deep dish pizza and man oh man this will be our new pizza place. So good! Also got a tiramisu to try and BBQ beef sandwich. Also awesome. They opened in October so I'm only bummed that we didn't find out about this place earlier!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp sorting for distance from my house. I'm really happy I did. I ordered the large deep dish and it is huge. The best looking and tasting pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza and outstanding customer service.  Will be a place we come back to frequently when we visit."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! This place has the best Pizza, super quick and efficient. If your looking for great Chicago Pizza this is the place. First had it at my uncles house and have come back multiple times!"}
{"text":"Haven't had anything that wasn't amazing. Pizza, Subs and My favorite the  chicken parmesan sandwich. Nicest people. So happy they have come to my neighborhood"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza place in henderson and I'm so happy I found this place.  I've gotten the deep dish pepperoni and it was the perfect ratio of cheese, sauce and crust.  The lady who answers the phone and is at the front is so helpful and nice! Definitely my go to pizza place from now on"}
{"text":"First for the good. Best Cannoli I have had in a long time. I may come back just for that.   The pizza on the other hand was okay, but there are many better options in Vegas. I'm not sure if they just don't know what Chicago Deep Dish is or if this is just their take on it because it was more like thick crust pizza. Real Chicago Deep Dish has a buttery flaky crust with the cheese on the bottom, tomato sauce on the top.   it's not deplorable but it isn't Chicago Deep Dish either, so don't advertise it that way. I will be back for cannoli though."}
{"text":"Authentic Chicago flavor from fresh ingredients.  Angelo the owner says nothing is from the can and the taste proves it.  He hits it out of the park with his pizza.  The sauce is not salty or sugary.  Italian sausage is amazing.  I've had every big Chicago pizza and this is at the top.  My only concern is how close to my house this place is because I'm trying to diet."}
{"text":"The double-decker pizza is a bomb. You just gotta try it. The large one can feed a lot of people as they cut it in 2\" squares and it's easier to hold and eat. Didn't get to try anything else but we'll definitely go back. Taste is good and they put a lot of cheese."}
{"text":"I have found heaven. No more flying in deep dish pan pizza from Chi-town. This is the best pizza this side of the Mississippi River. The Lady at the cash register named Alexa deserves a raise! She was courteous, professional and made great suggestions. I will be here every payday..  One slice is so loaded with toppings and so much cheese that I can only eat one.  One pie Kimberly feed a family of five or six. Thank you Avanti Pizza as I will be back for more."}
{"text":"The Avanti Pizza is away from my home and usual area. I just visited this pizza restaurant accidentally. I was in the area with few more friend and we decided to eat there. As a customer, my first impression is that this is cozy and nice place, family owned. Clean, well furnished place. I ordered an appetizer Calamari Ring on a price of $6.95. Big full dish with hot rings tasty and well flavoured. The guys from my company highly appreciated the calamari too. My hubby ordered french fries for about $3.55. Well, the appetizers were tasty however pretty pricey.  We ordered a Chicago Deep Dish Cheese Pizza.  Mmmm yummy.  You can chose from a variety of extra toppings and the prices was more than $15. It tasted great hot and juicy, with fresh ingredients.Actually, the portions here are big, full dish. Very generous indeed.  I took a closer look at the menu and noticed that the variety of Sandwiches is more than great for a small restaurant. My attention was grabbed by Italian Beef and The Avanti Sandwich. But will try them some other time.  The owner explained that the delivery cost is $3 which is pretty affordable as a price. The time delivery varies.  And before to end my customer experience review, would like to mention the service that was not very fast but it is pretty friendly. Will I visit Avanti Pizza once again ? If I am in the area will do it for sure. I will love to taste the Fettuccini Alfredo and the Cannoli."}
{"text":"We decided to order from Avanti last Friday night. We placed our order for a meatball sandwich, a BBQ sandwich and garlic bread. It took well over an hour to arrive when the restaurant is only a mile away. More importantly, the food was disgusting. Both sandwiches came on untoasted soggy buns. The contents of those sandwiches tasted like they came to us straight from the freezer to the microwave. The meatball sub is only disgusting frozen meatball and sauce. Where's the cheese?? Not on this sandwich! The BBQ sub was sickeningly sweet. It was barely edible at all.   tl;dr Avid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Very good pizza highly recommended. I ordered a pizza to pick up at 5 o'clock I got there a little bit early and they had it ready for me.  Got home it was very good very delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza. It's new but their quality is exceptional. If you want a change from your typical pizza chain, try these guys. The difference is night and day. They do thin crust, REAL deep dish, beef sandwiches, salads and delicious desserts (and I'm sure more). They even have a double-decker pizza, which I highly recommend. This is one of the best pizza places around. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered the spaghetti and it was gross. The sauce wasn't tomatoey at all, it was dark brown and tasted burnt & flavorless. And I'm not sure what the \"Italian bread\" was supposed to be but it was just plain white bread with nothing on it."}
{"text":"What an awesome pizza place!  My  husband and I are so happy we found this place.  Their pizza is delicious.  Very generous toppings and cheese.    The owner is great also!  He gave us a free tiramisu when my coupon code didn't work.  Great customer service!  If you want great pizza, try this place.  We absolutely LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I am originally from New Jersey and while I am partial to the thinner crust pizzas, I do really enjoy deep dish as well. As my uncle would say, \"Hey! Good pizza is good pizza.\" Avanti's deep dish is really good pizza.   Excellent quality. Thank you to all those who commented on the sausage, it is the best I have ever had on any pizza. The cheese, sauce and pepperoni were dynamite as well.   It is kind of tucked away in the shopping plaza on Pecos and Wigwam, but well worth the visit. Very nice people at the counter.   It is only for to-go and delivery as they have no seating area."}
{"text":"Just ordered 2 pizzas off grub hub and our company enjoyed it and so did we. We will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a deep dish cheese pizza. We love  cheese, but it was like they gave us triple cheese, it was a LOT, had to take some off. The crust tasted like plain breadsticks."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from this restaurant and it won't be my last. I've been a single working professional for a long time, which means I have ordered a lot of pizza delivery! And this is the first time in a long time that the pizza arrived HOT! Not warm or lukewarm, but actually HOT!   I got the Chicago style.  Ok, so it wasn't true Chicago style like some other reviews have mentioned, but it was a really good pie! Nice sauce, fresh veggies, and a good amount of cheese. My only quibble is the crust might be a little too chewy, but other than that I was satisfied.   And usually when I order pizza, while my hunger may satiated; I usually hate myself for being too lazy/tired to cook and feel like I wasted money on something only a step above what's in the frozen food aisle. I would actually order this when I have guests over the age of 12. I can't say that about most pizza delivery."}
{"text":"Ordered from here the other night. The pizza was fresh and good. Had it ready for me right on time and the service was great. The person that helped me was super nice and gave me an extra dressing for our salad at no cost. Definitely will order again!"}
{"text":"Awesome tasty pizza ! Owner took my order / great customer service-  even when it's one of their very nice staff.   I now am hooked on thin crust - it's outstanding here.   They even \"hurried\"my delivery for me ..  it's my go to pizza place in Henderson.   Laurel B"}
{"text":"This pizza is the bomb! Loooove, this pizza! Omg, so fabulous, & I am hard on good eats! They also accommodate in health needs! Dairy intolerant, pizza is correct & tasty! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were binge watching Downton Abbey last night so we decided to order out for some pizza. We had never tried Avanti Pizza, so we ordered a small Deep Dish Chicago pie, half cheese, and half pepperoni, sausage and onion. 42 minutes later, the doorbell rang and a fresh, hot pizza was delivered (we live just under 2 miles from the place) The pizza looked great, smelled great, and had lots of cheese and toppings. I selected a slice with the toppings, and it was delicious! The crust was buttery and flakey, and thicker than a NY pie (which it should be). The sauce and cheese were excellent. The toppings were well distributed and were also excellent. We have lived in Vegas for 9 years (NY transplants) and this pie was one of the best pies we have eaten in Vegas (and didn't cost $35.00 like on the Strip). While it was not technically a Chicago deep dish pie (the cheese and toppings were on top of the sauce), we will certainly order from Avanti again. We will try some of the other interesting menu items next time. Next time you have a hankering for a good pizza, Avanti will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I ordered a large deep dish. Half pepperoni with black olives and the other half sausage with spinach. Very tasty. My family love the pizza. Delivery was about an hour as promised. Very happy all around. Will order a thin crust next."}
{"text":"Over the weekend I ordered from Avanti Pizza through Eat 24. It was just too hot to leave the house. Having food delivered before relaxing in the pool for the rest of the day seemed like a great idea.  Online I easily found the menu with item descriptions and pricing. I made my choices and placed the order with payment in just a few minutes. I was quoted 45-60 minutes for delivery. Our delivery driver arrived within that time frame and was friendly.  The Mexican Pizza really hit the spot for me. The toppings were generously loaded and the crust was able to stand up to the toppings. I liked that the pizza had a taco sauce base instead of marina. The Avanti Salad was a salad large enough for 3-4 people. The salad was made up of greens, not iceberg lettuce and I always love that. There were plenty of the listed toppings including tomatoes, pepperoncini, provolone, onion, and black olives. The House Italian dressing on the side was actually a dressing that Avanti made. I liked the flavor of the seasonings in the dressing."}
{"text":"So a few things I want to really say about what I admire in this restaurant. The calamari was delicious and perfectly crisp and the marinara dipping sauce was perfect. The garlic bread was good not great but deff worth adding to your meal though I wish they would add a tad more garlic to it. But on to the pizza this thing was literally the most spicy pizza I have ever eaten after about five slices I literally could not stomach another bite because my mouth was on fire! I ordered the sliced Italian beef pepperoni and jalapeños I expected some heat but I honestly could not believe how insanely spicy this pizza was it had a good flavor but with heat like that it was almost inedible. I'm positive I did not ask for spicy marinara or anything of that nature so I am unaware of why it was so hot but I would hope not all of their pizza is like that. As for now I will continue to go to sunset pizza where I can enjoy a whole meal without feeling like I'm sweating fire."}
{"text":"This is the real deal Chicago style deep dish pizza that I'm used to. It was very easy to order online it was ready when I got there they were friendly and courteous. I highly recommend trying them."}
{"text":"Ordered from here thru the eat app saw some chicken fingers they looked good so ordered them ,decent price 8.45 for 6 of them when I got my food I was kind of disappointed because no fries or any sides my personal opinion the meal was \"off\" then I went and checked how much fries were they were almost 4$ ....the chicken was great really great just would have been a better meal all together with a side ...still would eat here again"}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza is amazing. Really expensive, but you get what you pay for when it comes to pizza. A med deep dish can easily feed 3... the large is prob 5 ppl. My favorite local pizza place!"}
{"text":"Just tried them out on an impulse for wings and pizza. I was happy I did. Pizza quality was wonderful. Great crust and the sauce is a major \"going come back for more\" thing. The wings were cooked correctly. Crispy while dripping with hot sauce. The way they should be. The owner is a good guy and I will definitely, send him my business."}
{"text":"Great service and food. There was a mixup with my order (due to the service I ordered through) and they were very quick to fix as well as offer me a discount for my trouble. Deep dish pizza was killer and the hot tenders were a real surprise hit.   Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I've had pizza from Avanti a few times now. Both the thin crust and deep-dish are very good. Tonight, I decided to try some wings as well with my order from Bite Squad. I'm very picky about wings. I asked for them extra crispy and extra hot. I got them and they were fantastic. I'm from the east coast and one of my biggest issues with Vegas is that it's hard to find good wings, and even when I get good wings somewhere, they're inconsistent (I'll go again and they won't be as good). I can happily say, these were some of the best wings I've had in a long time. The sauce had a bit more of a hint of sweetness than tanginess, which was different but certainly not in a bad way, but they had a definite punch to them in terms of heat, the chicken was good quality, you could tell thye were cooked in clean oil, they were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, not \"watery\", the bones were white not purple/black when you got to them, also a sign of a good quality wing that was cooked properly and the sauce was thick and clung to the wings so you got the taste of it the whole way through. Outstanding. If they are this good every time I order them, you've a got a fan of your pizza AND wings for life."}
{"text":"Had the chicken parm last night for the first time after eating there 20+ times. It was \"THE BOMB\". Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The owners are my closet friends, when they wanted to open up a pizzeria, \" I was like yay!! That's awesome!!\"  I knew it was gonna be real good due to the fact that they had their own Italian restaurant in Chicago.  I'm from Chicago, born and raised. And nothing taste better than a Chicago pizza!!   They're pizzas are exactly like Chicago Style Pizza.  Delicious!!!!!   You won't be disappointed!!    They Rock!!!!!!!!!    So, come on down and get authentic Chicago pizza. I dare YOU!!"}
{"text":"It's okay. Tastes like take and bake from Papa Murphy's. They are very generous with toppings and delivery is relatively prompt."}
{"text":"Love these guys, love the double decker. Quality pie, nice staff, good prices. Come here, eat pizza, make friends."}
{"text":"This is my fourth time I've been to Avanti. It is the best. I have had been to all the pizzeria restaurants in Las Vegas throughout the years and love Avanti's pizza. Very friendly atmosphere. Great family owned restaurant. I give it the highest rating possible."}
{"text":"First time ordering tonight for delivery....food showed up hot like I was at the restaurant ...thin crust pizza very good could use more sauce .... Wings perfect with just the right amount of eat...overall I give it a 4 and will be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"My usual place was closed so I tried this 4+ place.  It arrived faster than time stated but food was cold.  It also looked and tasted like frozen pizza.  The crust was very thin and hard, hardly any sauce, and it is cut in these tiny little pieces.  I'm from NYC, never seen pizza cut like this.  I also lived in California and never seen that.   I ordered the meat pizza, 4 items, only found 3.  I guess it wasn't there night."}
