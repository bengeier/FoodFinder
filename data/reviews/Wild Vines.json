{"text":"Service was very good.  Food was less than stellar.  Unfortunately when you think flat bread, it's not a frozen type pita bread, missing the Alfredo Sauce and topped with a single piece of Portobello mushroom, cold onions and half an artichoke out of a jar. And surprising that two drinks, one appetizer and two small entrees was over $100.  Very disappointing.  The search for really good food continues in Anthem."}
{"text":"Love the beef skewers here and happy hour is great! Good overall experience!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Could use some help - but a decent place to grab a glass or two of wine and some apps. The server did not come around as often as we would have liked, but did apologize and tell us that the kitchen was overwhelmed and they plan on expanding it soon...? She did suggest an easy-drinking red wine that we loved (667 Pinot Noir). The hummus was delicious, the olive bruscetta a little too salty, even for olive bruscetta... I would go back and try again...a decent option for a night out if you want something in Anthem."}
{"text":"We went in. 3 servers and no one even greeted us. Finally one came up said she would bring us water and a menu. Never saw her again. We got up and left. Came to connelys and were taken care of right away. At wild vines they weren't even very busy. We live literally right inside the gates to the country club and will not go there again."}
{"text":"First time at Wild Vines! If you're looking for over priced, extremely small portion food with wilted lettuce then this place is for you! This place is definitely not for the hungry but more for the anorexics! How can you charge $14 dollars for three lousy dry spicy meatballs and call that an entrée! I can get a better meatball sandwich at subway than this lousy restaurant."}
{"text":"I really don't know where to begin to explain all the things wrong with my dinner experience at Wild Vines. I will list them for you:  1) no one greeted us when we walked in, ended up seating ourselves. Place was almost empty.  2) the place is a trying to be a wine bar in a strip mall, big mistake ..so it's more like a sports bar with one small tv, and loud locals picking their fantasy football drafts.. BUT they serve several choices of wine, sooooo I guess it's a wine bar??  3) the menu has the choice of an olive appetizer boasting 6 different types of olives. Very exciting!.. Except when it arrived it was a bowl full of Kalamata olives. They threw a little parsley on top. I guess to hide the fact that they didn't have the 5 other types?? I asked the server and she said it was because they had a big run on olives the previous night. (Wow!)  4) everyone on here raves about the jalapeño glazed chicken skewers. Well if you consider cubed chicken with red pepper and onion doused in sweet chill sauce good then give it a go. Awful! Order the asparagus fettuccine .. That was good. Although interesting to eat without the help of a spoon.  5) they didn't have the wine we ordered, funny that too was because they sold the last bottle the previous evening and they aren't carrying it anymore. (It must have been a busy Friday!)  Honestly the ONLY good thing about this place was the server \"Beth.\" She was very apologetic for everything and a great server. She really should find another place to work, it is sad that she has to be the one to face the music for what the cook and owners are doing or should I say not doing."}
{"text":"Great drinks, nice atmosphere, good service. Sadly, the food is not good here. My husband had the shrimp skewers, which were overpriced and very over-cooked. I had a flatbread \"pizza\" that was DROWNING in cheese. Go for the drinks, but go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Very expensive for a strip mall dining establishment. The $12.00 appetizers would be $8.00 most other places. If you have the patience to wait, and wait, and wait for your food and drinks, then go for it. We had to flag down the waitress to get silverware after our food was brought to the table and she never checked to see if we needed anything, including drinks. Then it took 2 tries to get the bill. Food was so so. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This was the most disturbing dining experience (attempted) my wife and I have ever encountered.  We had dined here twice before.  Once under the prior management and once under the new management.  The fist visit was great with excellent food and service. The second under new owner was a big change.  Food not quite the same quality, service lacking and they were out of some basic items. Understood it was new management and they may need some time to get up to speed so we decided to give it another try a month later.  Walked in on a Saturday at 7pm and noticed only two tables with customers and 4 people at the bar.  We sat down in the middle of the bar and watched as 4 server/bartenders spoke to people at the bar and prepared drinks.  We sat at the bar for over 10 minutes with not one bartender or server even acknowledging that we were there.  I mean not even looking at us as they walked by us behind the bar.  There were at least 3 servers behind this small bar, they were not busy and yet they could not find the time to say hello or ask what we wanted to drink.  We are the easiest people in the world to please, usually order our meal at the bar and always leave at least a 30% tip.  We really thought this was some kind of joke but after 10 minutes realized that they apparently just don't care.  We have never got up and walked out of a restaurant but we did on this evening and will never go back.  Ended up driving to Yard House and had an excellent meal with outstanding service as usual.  I have never written a review about a dining experience but this one so disturbed us that I signed up with yelp to let others know what a let down this place has become.  You would think in a small community like Anthem, customer service would"}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to Anthem...despite the 3 star rating we decided to try Wild Vines.  It was a busy place on a Saturday night. We were greeted by the bartender and told to choose a table.  Our server April (she was awesome) arrived within minutes. We both had wine flights (I had the Michael David, wonderful).  We ordered food, stuffed dates and flatbreads. The food was good, not exceptional, but then we have a professional chef in the family so we set the bar high:-).  Live entertainment, Josh West, along with his guitar playing Dad was very enjoyable, a talented duo!  All in all we had a great evening, right in our own \"backyard\". Highly recommend for casual evening or \"date night\"."}
{"text":"I was just there last Friday; heard they are under new ownership. Great tapas, decent wine. Just need to add one more waitress and bartender to the Friday night staff.   Oh, great music, too."}
{"text":"New resident to Anthem...very pleased to find this location.  Only there for happy hour...but great service.  The cheese selection and the crab cake has to be the best we have ever had!  Great place and we look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here for date nights because it's so close to home, we don't have to worry about the kids, and we feel like we're going to a fun \"grown up\" place to hang out and talk.  We've been here 3 times either on a Friday or Saturday night.  Even though the place was busy we were always greeted immediately with a friendly smile.  The service has always been wonderful and the drinks awesome.  We've tried the flat bread and it was delicious.  I'm looking forward to going back again and doing a GNO!"}
{"text":"I really like this place under the NEW management!!!!  The atmosphere is much more open and laid back. Im not sure if the clientele is the same or not, but if it is, they all left their sticks (that used to be implanted ) at home!!!  LOL.   But seriously, you will notice that everyone is having a great time. Whether it's a table for one or ten.  It is an ideal place for a date,  group, or all girls night."}
{"text":"I don't usually put in comments about places, but I had to let people know before they decided to go here on a weekend night thinking of having a casual wine/appetizer evening with their spouse ... think again!  I think there was only one waitress working the whole place.  We sat outside on the patio for about 20 minutes and she came out and said she would be with us shortly.  We waited another 35 minutes and she was no where near heading in our direction - so we left.  I can't tell you how their food/drinks were, because I didn't even get that far - if I have to wait an hour just to get a drink/water I can't imagine how long it would take to get our food!  Those of us crazies still living in Anthem know that there are very limited places to go, but if you ARE one of the few places people decide to come to, wouldn't you hire more staff to get the service up to par and make it a place people WANT to hang out at?  Needless to say, we won't EVER be going back there again - who has that kind of time to waste?  I'd rather drive down to Scottsdale and get served as soon as I get there than drive 5 minutes and wait an hour to get water!  Good Luck Wild Vines ... you'll be on the list of closed places in Anthem pretty soon ...."}
{"text":"The yelp menu says organic. IT IS NOT ORGANIC according to the staff. The Romain lettuce was tough and the salad dressing was exceedingly mild,  almost tasteless. I ordered the quinoa and veggies. The veggies were only carrot and celery and they were in long strips that were so tough I could not cut them. The sauce taste like it came out of a jar. They gave me my money back. My companion had the spicy meatballs. The noodles were under done. The beer and wine selection is outstanding. Service was very good and exceedingly knowledgeable, and then we couldn't get their attention for the rest of the evening."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved everything about this place. Great service, nice setting, fantastic food, and lots of wine choices."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what Anthem needs as an alternative to endless beer-pizza-wings joints on every corner. Nice, clean, quaint place with excellent wine list, great beer selection and now top shelf liquor. Food is a basic menu but nicely done and tasty. It's not the place for a full-blown five course meal, but the fare is certainly paired well with wine and you can get a great pasta dish, gourmet flatbreads, etc to fill up on.  My wife and I will hit this place on our way to a movie night or the theatre downtown. Prices are very fair - especially during happy hour. Then we sometimes hit it on the way back too. Or a great, classy place to sneak away from the rugrats for an hour without blowing fifty bucks. Management changed for the better about six months ago and the clientele is fun, hip and not snobby at all. Just an all around good neighborhood hangout place, maybe even worth a trip from outside Anthem."}
{"text":"The bartender chicks are always cool and welcome me with open arms, yes even by myself. It happens to be a great place to just hang out at the bar maybe have an appetizer. Oh and the food? Very good!! The wine selection? Even better."}
{"text":"Cant go lower than 1 star, I guess.  3 Bar well drinks = $30 plus tax.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp.  We were looking for something light to eat with wine. How lucky can you get? There is regular seating. Seating at the bar and outdoor setting.  The atmosphere is nice, giving a sense of class, but not overstated.  The staff greeted us and everybody who entered with a warm welcome.  The wine selection is a good mix of Arizona wines, as well as wines from around the world.  We went with a selection of Tapas.  All were excellent.  You can sample any of the wines that are already open, which helped us to make some good selections.  A great place to meet friends, have a special dinner out, or simply relax.  Noise level was low, which allowed for good conversation.    All-in-all a great experience"}
{"text":"We've gone here twice. We tried to give them a second shot after a less than exciting first visit. They were out of everything on their very tiny menu. We got two dishes that tasted like Lean Cuisine. Ugh. So the next time around I got a sandwich and my husband got the same pasta dish hoping for something better.  The food was plain and the noodles were again like a frozen dinner.  Better options for eats in this area than this place. I suppose if your thing is wine and beer, by all means indulge, but for something edible keep hunting."}
{"text":"This place was a complete disappointment.  My husband and I were excited to try a local place in Anthem, but the entire meal was a disappointment.  The caprese salad had block mozzarella rather than fresh mozzarella.  The crab cakes clearly came out of a box and were cooked there.  My husband ordered a steak medium and it showed up very well done. He sent it back and the 2nd steak was not seasoned nor were the sides.  They comped his meal and discounted the rest of the meal, but we will not return to give them a 2nd chance.  I'm not sure how they're surviving... Must be the drinks rather than the food."}
{"text":"05/15/2018 Now offering beef tacos. It's always good to offer something new!  Taco Tuesday are amazing. The patio is is cozy and covered from the hot Az sun.  Each table has a fire pit center for cold days.  Staff rocks. Pup friendly. It would be super awesome if they offered a pup menu as well"}
{"text":"I heard good things. I am a single lady in my early 50s. I LOVE wine! I called ahead and was told it was ladies night. I am new to Anthem and there are very few dining choices. I have a local favorite, but wanted to try something different. Just and FYI, I appreciate good service and am a big tipper. I walked in to Wild vines at around 5:30 PM on a Wednesday.  I was unimpressed with the atmosphere and design for a wine bar. It just looked like a bar to me. I was dining alone, There was one large group in the corner- maybe 5 ladies. NO ONE ELSE. I stood at the door for a minute, no one greeted me. One of the servers ( I guess ) told me I could sit anywhere I want. I picked a small table directly across from the bar ( that is all there is). The waitress asked me if I was alone and then practically threw 4 menus at me. Very little selection and somewhat expensive for the atmosphere.  I then sat there for 14 minutes and listened to the 2 girls behind the bar talk. No water, no wine, nothing. Talking and laughing and talking and laughing. Even when I stood up to leave and was going to tell someone, NOTHING. I actually had to interrupt the man who seemed to be working the other table to tell him I was leaving. While the girls were still talking and laughing behind the bar. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! I will Never go there again and would not recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have a lot of mixed feelings about leaving this review. I Love the ambiance and the staff are incredibly knowledgeable and sweet. I love the wine selection and Andrea Will make sure that you always get the wine that you love; however, the kitchen is terrible and the food overpriced!  We have been there several times to eat and it has ranged between palatable and awful. We went last night with another couple and not only did we wait well over two hours for our entrée, but when we all got our food we were  laughing and tasting each other's food because it was so unbelievably bad. There was a special menu for Valentine's Day that would've been overpriced for good food but was absolutely insulting based on the quality. The food had no flavor. It was not seasoned in anyway and tasted like it had been sitting out for days.  My friend had quinoa that tasted like sand and  my salmon was so dry I could barely swallow it.There was a lot of people coming in and out of the kitchen and they looked well staffed. Also, the place is very small so I don't know what was going wrong.  I drank so much wine waiting for my food that my bill was enormous! There was a couple sitting at a table nearby that we were talking to,that went through the same thing as we did. They waited an hour for their food, drank too much wine waiting and when they tasted the food (because they were starving) they just asked for boxes immediately and went and ordered a pizza! We left happy but it was only because of the company and FOH service. We have so few places to go in this part of town, especially with a good wine selection so we keep going back hoping that it's going to get better. I would definitely recommend trying it if you are a wine lover (or wine curious) and again, most of the staff is absolutely fantastic but do yourself a favor and eat somewhere before you go."}
{"text":"Everyone loves a good local bar and eatery that they feel comfortable going to either by yourself or with a group of friends...Wild Vines is just that.  Great food, wine list,  full bar and a staff that is always smiling and helpful not to mention the ambiance.  There are always fun events and happy hour specials along with a dj on some nights...I've never had a bad experience there yet!"}
{"text":"I have been to wild vines 3 times and I have to say I will only be back if I am with someone else who wants to go.  1st time - only went in with my husband for a glass of wine/desert on a date night.  Sat at the bar and it was good.  2nd time - went with a friend.  We were acknowledged when we walked in to sit wherever and then after almost 30 mins left because no one even came to our table to say they would be with us.  It was moderately full, nothing crazy.  We left and went somewhere else.  3rd time - went back with the same friend, we sat at the table, the waitress took our drink/food order...so far better than last time.  The waitress spent most of her time behind the bar talking to the bar regulars.  I watched another table come in and sit and was never waited on and left.  We wanted more drinks and all we could do is laugh because the waitress acted like she wanted us to leave instead of ordering more drinks!   On a positive note - there was live music and he was really good."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly servers, Andrea at the bar is just amazing! Glad to have a wine bar with great food so close to home, not many options in Anthem!"}
{"text":"Much improvement. Starting to feel more like a wine bar. Todd and Beth are great additions to the staff as well. Great food still and the rest is starting to come together nicely."}
{"text":"Amazing food service and atmosphere Food came out perfect we had the salmon Service was first rate They atmosphere is fun and classy"}
{"text":"Another disappointing place in Anthem.  We tried this for the first time on October 30th for my birthday.  When we walked in, no one was behind the bar and we had to wait about 5 minutes before the hostess/bartender/waitress came by to say she would be with us in a few minutes.  After a few minutes, she came and took our order.  My husband and I both ordered wine and thought we would try a couple of appetizers.  We ordered the bruschetta and the cheese plate and to be honest, I could have done a better job at home.  Will not be returning even though the wine was decent (hard to screw that up) and service was good after the first initial problem we had."}
{"text":"My friend & I happened upon Wild Vines by complete accident as our car navigator & phone weren't finding a local wine bar as fast as we were moving so we just finally pulled in & there it was. We had a long hot day in Phx & were heading north on I-17 but needed some refreshments & appetizers. Our server was excellent (also cute) & helped us find a nice house wine named One Hope (I think) we had the Happy Hr special Hummus & the cheese board. We're going to be back in Phx tomorrow & we've already decided we're going to try dinner. I hope we have the same server. I took her picture & wanted to post it but I'm new @ this so maybe I'll have to ask for help from my nephew Kyle."}
{"text":"We enjoy wild vines for a glass or two of wine and a light meal of appetizers. While the food options aren't extensive, they are always tasty and reasonably priced. The wine selections are pretty extensive, and it looks like there is a good choice for other beverages as well. The service is good and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We go monthly to this tapas wine bar for Lady's Night, Fellowship, & Live Music.  The Grilled Zucchini, Prosciutto Wrapped Asparagus, Stuffed Dates, Shrimp Tacos, and Humus & Tzatiki plate are all yummy and a good value. Wine is only $5. & the Halloween photo is the staff not us."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, drinks, and service was good. The food however was not so fabulous. My husband had a spicy chicken sandwich that was barely palatable as it tasted like someone dumped a bottle of maple syrup in it. I had the ahi tuna asian style sandwich which came on limp, falling apart bread. There was no flavor. The best part of both of our meals were the chips which I doubt were made in house. I will not be going back. Good if you want just a nice bar to drink but I would say go somewhere else for food."}
{"text":"Wow! This is  a $14 Ceaser salad. And it took 30min. On top of screwing up another order at our table and bringing out only two orders then the other two 10min latter. We won't be back. Just because there are not many options in the area doesn't mean you can be crappy."}
{"text":"Time for a MAJOR update to my previous review!!! NEW OWNER... And, boy have things changed... Let's start by when you first walk through the door, remember the tv sitcom CHEERS? Well, it's back! And it's here in Anthem at the Wild Vines...  The bartender Andrea is unlike anyone who you have ever met! She remembers your name, your story and what you drink! My husband and I sat in amazement watching her in action, and couldn't believe it! Along with her infectious personality she is brilliant in her knowledge of wines! And, that is another plus... If you like your wines or your a novice, here is where you become educated and taste what is out there! They actually have a \"wine flight\", on the menu where u can try five different wines, depending on your palate preference... And, Andrea helps u make that decision. Then there is the NEW MENU... I had the Caesar Salad, half shrimp half chicken on top.. Fantastic, before that I had the Tomato basil soup, beyond good.. Just the right amount of spice, I cherished every slurp... My husband had the chicken Alfredo, since it is one of his favorite go to dishes he is a good critic, and he said this was one of the best he has had in a very long time! And, last but NOT least a word about the owner..Deanna , I am sure I have her name wrong, but she is the reason the place , which was once a diamond in the rough, is going to succeed. She is ALWAYS there, interacting with the patrons , getting a read on what people like, their thoughts and will always listen to suggestions... She is smart!  There is live entertainment on the weekends...beautiful little patio with gas fire pits... It's just wonderful.. We will be one of the regulars at the place Where Everybody Knows Your Name!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  High priced like they think they are in scottsdale and when we went oven not working and out of Cesar dressing.  Wtf?"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé went for a date night and sat out side. It took a while for a server to come over to give us menus and take a drink order. It was a slow week night so there should be no reason to take the server long to come over. There were two other groups outside and three inside. Food was OK nothing to ew and ha over."}
{"text":"Came in a couple of times with my wife, wanting to have a local favorite bar in anthem, summer 2014. I can say after several uncomfortable experiences we won't be coming back. The chicken and salmon skewers as well as the vines burger was often overcooked, and at that, nothing to get excited about. The best part of the burger were the fries, which were more than likely store bought. The skewers sat in a warm goo that overpowers the chicken by being too sweet and tasting cheap. The wine was fair, they have a decent selection albeit a little overpriced.  The servers there were all over the place. Andrea, while nice enough, tried to be welcoming and polite, but was intrusive and shouted at us from across the bar. And Whitney, what a joke. She had a scowl on her face the whole time, gave our wallets more attention than us, and let our food sit in the back (there's a little window into the kitchen) until we asked if that was our food. Lastly, she would scold and bark at one the busboy, saying all manner of things that he was the reason she was behind on our orders... He was doing dishes and washing windows while she was on her phone. Lastly, for the \"Red Party\" they had, it seemed cheap, overstaffed, and the owners sat in the corner drinking and eating for a lot of the night. Lastly, we remember hearing two servers tall about food code violations and that they worried about an inspector coming in. That was why we didn't come back in the end. I will say that the male server (forgot his name, had a beard) was very friendly and got everything out to us on one of the busier nights. All in all, if you're in the mood to drink at a dirty bar (not for a date) and watch a poorly coordinated and clumsy staff give you a sub par meal, Wild Vines is the place to go."}
{"text":"We have been here an hour and got one person in our 4 person party served at a time.  4th meal never came until all 3 others in party were done eating.  They comp'ted  2 of the meals. One never arrived so not happy.  Should have not charged for any of the meals.  Owner told us it was a tapas bar.  Should not offer other food if can't deliver."}
{"text":"Scott, and Theresa the owners are fantastic! Great food, great beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"I guess I'll be the dissenter in the group in the sense that I liked Wild Vines better under the old management. I like the idea of a wine bar because it's not the same as going to a sports bar or a sit down restaurant. In my opinion, it should be a place you go with a small group of people (2-4) to have some wine and enjoy conversation with your friends.   Wild Vines is still small, well decorated, and boasts a nice menu, but it is also louder and has a different atmosphere now. I understand that's a personal preference, but now instead of going out to try a new wine, I'll probably stay home and uncork a bottle with my family instead.   On the bright side, I've never been disappointed with the food, and this most recent visit was no exception. The mini cheese plate ($5 during happy hour) was delicious!"}
{"text":"AMAZING service with the BEST meatballs I've ever had. Every time I'm in Anthem, you will see me here."}
{"text":"Such a fun environment! Great food! Great drinks. It's small but that's what makes it fun. You see familiar faces every time you go! Great music, especially when the guy/girl singing duo are there! The only thing that would make this place better is to have maybe a bit more staff so the bartenders can catch their breath. The entire staff has smiles on their faces and are very friendly! We love coming here and will recommend it to all of our friends!"}
{"text":"So, I've been to Wild Vines a few times and it's so nice to have place like this in Anthem. The owners are awesome and so friendly. I also like they seem to take the customers opinions seriously, they really want feedback to get it just right!  I love the chicken skewers, really really yummy. Sweet and spicy at the same time and not at all dried out, which is easy to do with chicken skewers. We also tried the bruschetta, which I wasn't a huge fan of, just kind of bland. They have a few different kinds and were out of the one I wanted to try (can't remember what it was). We also did the cheese plate which has thin sliced apples and spiced nuts (almonds, I think). It was good, and I'm hoping to see some new cheeses next time we go in. As for the beer and wine, good selection, reasonable prices. The happy hour is really nice. I LOVE the Orange Blossom beer they have and it's only 2.50 at happy hour which is great!  Overall, I do love this place and am super excited to have a nice wine bar close to home"}
{"text":"Not many options in Anthem, and this is definitely not a good one.  Service is sooooo slow, servers not attentive, clearly understaffed.  Some food tastes yummy, but definitely not worth the price for the overall experience.  I'd rather eat Sonic, it's next door."}
{"text":"Food and wine really great... Sadly the service was lacking. Hopefully it was just an off night."}
{"text":"This place was great! After a rough week for both my husband and I, we were really looking for a small quaint place to grad a drink and good eats :) I remembered seeing Wild Vines on the show Downsized and thought this was the time to finally try them out. I jumped on yelp to see what the locals were saying and overall they had a positive review...  Make no mistake...this place is SMALL...but it felt very quaint and everyone seemed to truly enjoy themselves. The service was slow in the beginning but get a little better as our evening progressed.   They have a small yet amazing selection of beers - we both ordered the Black Butte Porter - DELISH!  For food we took the advice of other Yelpers: we had the Beef Skewers and Macaroni and Cheese. The beef skewers were nothing short of tasty and they serve it with a warm baguette to dip in the sauce (which was some sort of mushroom wine reduction - amazing). I love macaroni and cheese so much it might as well be my middle name and Wild Vines did a nice rendition of it .  We both agreed that this might be a regular stop on our culinary adventures!"}
{"text":"I love this place, even having my office party here again. However the idea that they need to salt a grill cheese to make you buy more drinks is just cheap and I little underhanded.    They have a great bar menu, don't get me wrong. But salt? Really?"}
{"text":"Never will I go here again! Their service needs a lot of work before I even think about coming back. I also suggest them to fix their menu and be more clear about what they are serving! When I ask for a wine from the Happy Hour menu and you send me two wines to try, I expect them to both be from the HAPPY HOUR menu!!! Then, getting the bill at the end and seeing they charge more than $2 for one coke! It says nothing on the menu about the cokes being $2.25 per one little 8 oz of coke. Usually if its per coke, they give you only a can and don't charge $2.25!! Then when we ask about it when we get the bill, the waitress said \"wow\". Like we were being rude and she wouldn't even come back to our table. We were just seeing if it was a mistake! I've been in the restaurant business for over 9 years and I would NEVER speak to a customer like that!!!   Honestly, I am surprised they are still open in this recession! I will never go here again. I don't mind paying a little more for good food, great service, and a great atmosphere. When there is none of that, then whats the point of going??  This place cost us $70 plus tip for happy hour for three people PLUS getting the worst service I ever had in my life. What a rip off!!!"}
{"text":"Fun!! couple of easy points: Good wine fair prices.  - Ill will swear to you that you will never have better chicken skewers in your life!!  - We sat at the bar but even the servers were still checking on us, and the bartender was AMAzing.  Best place in anthem by far.Good cheese plate as well, although I feel like goat cheese should be on there too.  We liked it so much we are going to a wine bar now in Anthem,az for cinco de mayo!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Great staff. Cool vibe. Cocktails made with care and love. I watched one bartender hand stuff blue cheese into fresh olives for a martini. Drinks were consistently hand made and not 'speed poured'. They have a pretty decent wine list. The same bartender recommended a wonderful red blend... and she was right. Yum!"}
{"text":"From the owner to the whole staff it's a wonderful place food and drinks are great ! Great menu and a knowledgeable staff on many good wines ! This is a must try place !  Great tapas and main courses ! April , Andrea , Ron , Eric and Kevin rock !"}
{"text":"Lots of unknown wines.  No bottle beer. Limited food items.  Small but close to club"}
{"text":"At first glance I found it to be an interesting concept to combine a wine bar with a sports bar. Soon it became evident this was only a sports bar that wanted to expand its clientele base to include wine and food. Albeit, the wine selection good and the food recommended, we're hoping the new management fixes the inconsistent quality in the kitchen. The staff? We'll they're nothing short of awesome; which keeps us coming back for more!  In the end, all I can say is be sure you come with the expectation to enjoy some wine while sitting in a loud sports bar. Yes fun at times, but not what I think most wine lovers are seeking...a quieter setting enjoying personal conversation with their guest(s) and a good foodie experience. Wishing great success to Deandra and team!"}
{"text":"Good place to chill on a Friday night. It was unusually crowded and the vibe felt right. This place seems livelier and I hope it stays that way. The server was confused and got some things backwards but it was understandable. She explained that the setup behind the bar was off and they all would make it right. Didn't try the food this time but will do next time.   Enjoy the selection. Personally, I love their whites. Especially the Rieslings."}
{"text":"I love wine! And this place is great. The owners are super friendly, the wine is great (when is wine not great though?), and the food was a nice surprise. We had bruschetta that was so good we ordered another. The chicken skewers were really good too. Great place, definitely the best in Anthem. I will be back..."}
{"text":"Great Chicken Alfredo!  Food is very tasty!  Service is always good too."}
{"text":"Excelent place!! I stopped by with my hubby while on a road trip and were pleasantly surprised to find a tapas/wine bar in this area. Food was great and so was the service! If I ever drive through Anthem again, I will definitely do a pit stop at Wild Vines"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here with friends on a Friday night.  We were anticipating a fun evening out and a yummy meal.  Well, three of the four entrees came out at once and the server told us the other would be here shortly.  Well, fifteen minutes later and it still wasn't here, so we flagged down the server and she said there were problems in the kitchen.  She said they had sent one of the chefs home early (???? it's Friday night at 7:00 PM).  By this time, our three entrees were cold as ice as none of us had touched them as we were waiting for my boyfriend's Ahi tuna entree.  The server told us she would comp us another round of drinks - just what we needed on an empty stomach.  :-(  So, the three of us began eating our cold food.  After at least 30 minutes - it could have been longer - my boyfriend's ahi tuna  finally came out.  It was supposed to be grilled ahi, but had barely been run over a grill.  It wasn't even warm.  My boyfriend told the male server who brought it to the table (a different server than the female we'd had all night) that the ahi wasn't done.  It needed to be grilled more.  The waiter got snippy and said \"This is the way we do it at Wild Vines.\"  I looked at him and said, \"Are you really arguing with a customer?\"  This guy knew my boyfriend had already been waiting at least 30 minutes PAST the time our entrees had been served.  What a jerk.  He backed off and said he wasn't arguing - he offered to take it back to the kitchen to cook it more.  My boyfriend declined since we were all done with our cold food by this time.  Sometime during this time, an unkempt-looking man with a sleeveless T-shirt, discheveled hair, and a grungy-looking backpack which he slung on the bar arrived.  He didn't look clean at all and we came to understand that he was one of the \"chefs.\"  When our server learned from the male server that there were problems with the ahi, she came over and offered to comp us dessert.  We really didn't want dessert.  We just wanted to leave.  Unbelievably, we had now been there for well over an hour and the only thing they comped us were one round of drinks.  All of our cold meals were full price.  She did point out that she comped the ahi salad - at which point I busted up laughing since it wasn't touched and was sent back to the kitchen immediately.  Wild Vines has potential, for sure.  The cold food we ate would have probably been excellent had it been eaten hot.  What this place lacks most is experienced restaurant management.  If they're going to cater to the wine crowd, then they really need to do an overhaul in how to treat customers, how to expedite food properly, and most importantly, what to do when things turn into a cluster f*$#.  There were any number of ways they could have saved the night (and their reputation) if there had been anyone there who understood the value of the customer experience.  We ended up leaving and going over to Ocho (a Mexican restaurant) where we had excellent margaritas and my boyfriend got a wonderful quesadilla - as he was starving by this time."}
{"text":"Tasty food but small portions for the price and extremely under staffed. Food came out one piece at a time and initially with no silverware. Service structure and kitchen setup needs to be reevaluated."}
{"text":"Good spot for craft beer and wine."}
{"text":"What a nice change from the other restaurants in Anthem - much more upscale with great wine and beer selection and many food options.  Andrea is very welcoming.  Nice atmosphere and great background music."}
{"text":"Yum! I really enjoy the atmosphere! I had the shrimp ceaser salad! The flavors were delicious! We also had the bruschetta appetizer! Both items were delicious! I just wish their portions were bigger. ( hence the 4 stars) Our server was attentive & informative! My pet peeve is when you ask a server about an item and they don't know much about it! Our server answered all of our questions!"}
{"text":"A frequent stop when I'm visiting family. Small cozy atmosphere, very attentive service, a varied menu and of course, wine! My fav menu items:crab cakes, bruschetta,meatballs, kabobs,salmon. Try the flight of different wines to find your fav. Never a disappointment! Very consistent offerings.Always an enjoyable experience. A sophisticated atmosphere. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I went to Wild Vines with my girlfriends for drinks and dinner in celebration of a girl's night out. When we walked in, there was probably 10 customers and one bartender. We had been greeted by the bartender immediately and water and menus followed 20 Minutes later. We ordered a round of drinks, the cheese platter and hummus appetizer. All items were good, but from that point on the night went south . No one came back for a second round of drinks or anything else until a new server started about 30 minutes later.  We finally placed our dinner orders,  shrimp skewers , Ahi salads, flat bread , shrimp pasta and chicken kabobs. The Ahi salad was $18.00 and foul in every way; the smell , the wilted lettuce, canned Chinese rice noodle sticks and Kraft bottled dressing; the most disgusting salad I have ever tasted.  The shrimp kabobs never came, but some creamy shrimp with a wilted salad came. The flat bread pizza was just thrown on a plate and looked previously prepared. The chicken skewers never made it, one of my friends was so over the crappy service , she was about to go next door to sonic. The pasta; everything was edible but the shrimp.  When we sent everything back, the waiter made an excuse that everyone working today was new (including himself) and that they've had nothing but problems with the new chef. The bartender came by and took our plates to show the owner the food that came out, since she has had issues with the new chef as well and wanted him to see for himself. We ordered a grilled cheese and wedge salad to replace the Ahi salad and all I can say it was untouched as well.  After we asked to talk to the manager the waiter came back apologized and dropped a round of drinks from our bill to compensate. We weren't expecting more, but felt the owner should know how bad our experience was since it is his restaurant and you want repeat business. It seemed like the owner was hiding, avoiding to talk to us because he took forever to come to our table. The bartender came by and told us she was paying for our dinner on her dime because she felt so bad. We insisted that she bill us for something, so we can tip her, since the situation with the chef was out of her control. She took each of our cards to put $8.00 in so we can each tip at least $10.00 . The Owner finally came to our table and apologized and said that he suggested to pay for the bill (means the bartender lied to us) and appreciated our patience. He gave us is own story about coming in to the restaurant and explained the chain of events that happened that evening. Apparently he had to leave home sick to be come back to the restaurant to handle the upcoming problems. #1 : why would any of you show your dirty laundry and throw your own staff under the bus. #2 why would you be so carefree to not compassionately care about your food, your staff, your service. I've said enough and this review may seem already winded , but I'm curious to see just how long it will take for this business to shut down. I felt like I was being filmed on Kitchen Nightmares. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day with this one. I don't even want to see their kitchen, because I would probably throw up. Bummed that I have to give them one star."}
