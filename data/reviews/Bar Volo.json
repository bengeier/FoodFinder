{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to remove a star from my rating as we visited Volo again last Thursday, and the service was so different from what it was like in our previous visit. 
We headed back to Volo as they had a flyer up the last time saying that one of the Breweries was going to be there to showcase their beers, and there was going to be a BBQ as well. Upon arriving, there was absolutely nothing, and we asked one of the waiters, who didn't know what was going on, and then said the flyer must have been from last year with the wrong date (2010??!!) printed on it. 
In addition to that, it was impossible for them to manage to give us a second order of bread, as this time it was different bread and a much smaller portion of it (which you have to pay for, but we have no problem with), but after 30 minutes of waiting, the bread arrived dry, and the olive oil that is served with it, didnt even have any pepper/chili/anything it it, the way it usually does. In addition to that, our waitress did not understand that we ordered 2 of the same dishes, and not just one to be shared, so when our dinner came, and we asked for a second dish, it took over half and hour again to get this plate, during which of course everyone else in our group had finished eating. 
The wine glass had water in it, from being rinsed, which was not poured out before serving the glass and the wine, and it was just overall quite disappointing from the last time we went and loved it so much. 
The beer is however still great, but we just wish the service had not let us down so much."}
{"text":"Great selection of Canadian craft beers! The owners have great relationships with Ontario and Quebec brewers who often choose this venue to showcase their more \"experimental\" brews. A great place to check out for their Monday night draught features!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Perfect setting for awesome beer and chatting with friends. If you like cask beers, this is the place."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. This place is good for 2 people - max. 4. Beware: it is not a restaurant. It's more of a bar with food. There were no servers around the \"dining area\" and the person bringing food out from the kitchen told us to order from the bar. We ordered the charcuterie board and it was delicious - again, good for 2 people. This place is always busy so be prepared to wait for a table, but you can wait in the bar area and have a drink while you wait. They also have a great patio in the summer. One of the few places to drink and eat with a good atmosphere in the area it's in."}
{"text":"I've been to many bars in the city and I must say this is the best bar in the city. This bar is operated by a small family and their wait staff that absolutely love and appreciate beer. 

The beer selection is extensive. Although pricey, you can get your hands on pretty much any beer you would like to try. Although the menu has been cut down, I still think their burgers are great and they have an awesome pork/beef pot pie special on most days.

Highly recommend this place for a pint."}
{"text":"I had some beer and the Baller's board here. It was a bit on the salty side, but none the less very delicious. Also, it's a lot of food, good for sharing."}
{"text":"Maybe the best bar in Toronto.

The tap choices are seemingly limitless & the the bottles are too many to count. Mike was my bartender. He was very knowledgeable and extremely pleasant. 

The food is outstanding. I had the veal burger - it is definitely the best burger I've had in a long while. If you're in the mood for something a little different, then try the Caribou & Fig pate. It was one of the most unique dishes that I have ever tasted.

One thing to watch for - service is faster at the bar than if you get a table."}
{"text":"It was ok, a little pretentious. The food and beer were excellent however when you order you're asked to pay in advance or leave your card to start a tab. We opted to pay in advance. We ordered a charcuterie board, chorizo crostini and chorizo. The charcuterie board arrived first. After finishing finishing the board we realized the rest of the meal wasn't delivered. When we flagged down the waiter he tried to brush us off. Then we noticed another table had our number and were eating our food that we paid for. The waiter did apologize and said the kitchen was making our food right away. All we got was a bowl of chips as \"I'm sorry\". The meal that the other table ate for free should have been compted.  We would have stayed for more drinks but didn't like how the situation was handled. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers. Their food is standard pub fare. I don't go there for the food. Patio is nice in the summer though not very big. Overall a nice atmosphere to down an after work refreshment."}
{"text":"They are well known for their variety of their beers.  Small space, even for 2 people on a friday night we had to wait for 30-45 min for a table.  Great selection of cheese and charcuterie."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I like to go here because of the great beer selection, cool vibe and great menu.  We've been here multiple times but this last time was the worst experience, hence the poor review.  Not sure if there's been an owner or management change, but things are not as they were.

Bad feeling #1 - As we're waiting for our table, I ask to sample a beer before I order it and the bartender says he'll charge me 30 cents for that.  OK, never experienced that before.  It's not as if I wasn't going to order a pint afterwards.

We also notice they had a 'temporary menu'.  After asking what happened to their other menu options like pizza and pasta, the waitress tells us that they're trying to focus less on food and more on beer.  She said they had to make more room in the kitchen for casks, so they had to reduce their menu offerings.  Uh-oh, bad feeling #2. 

We place our order.  After 20 minutes of waiting, we ask the status of our order.  The guy who took our order looked dumbfounded and said he would check on it.  Never came back.  We wait another 10 mins while watching other people get their food who arrived after us.  Uh-oh, bad feeling #3.  The guy obviously forgot our order.  The waitress comes over and tells us that our order is being plated.  Another 5-10 minutes passes, still no food.  At this point, we realize that our order is not ready and no one has come over to apologize, update us or tell us anything!  We decide that being treated this way as patrons and waiting over 30 mins for food is unacceptable and we go to pay for our beers and leave.

Then the bartender comes out after us and starts yelling at us!!!  Yelling on the street to us.  His customers!!!  He failed to appropriately ask us what happened, said if he knew more he would've 'done something' for us, admitted that they forgot our order but he wouldn't let us speak.  He told us that we didn't understand the restaurant business and during this entire interaction he never apologized or even took a breath to calm down and refrain from yelling.  It was quite the scene.  I've never been treated so poorly as a customer.

This was a very unfortunate experience.  We loved going here and supporting this establishment.  

Whatever happened to the customer always being right?  
Next time, i'll pay more attention to my intuition and feelings.  They're always right."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers from A-Z. Cool crowd but make sure you come at the right time. The demographics are drastically different depending on the time. I haven't tried the food, but it looks great. I will definitely come back again. It is a gem in the neighborhood. 

The drawback is that there seems to be a lack of staff and service. The staff are nice if you find them though. Not a place to go if you want full service."}
{"text":"Yes to everything - this bar has it all. 

Bar Volo shows all the other bier poseurs how it's done. My number one place for craft beer and hip ambiance, bar none. (I'm a poet and I didn't even know it?)

Atmosphere:

Yonge Street. Slightly rustic grimy upscale hipster. All of the above. Bring a date, bring your friends. Bar seating, floor seating, window seating, patio. Only issues: 1) Volo isn't very big 2) it's a great bar and everyone knows it. Therefore: Come early or be disappointed. Hard to find seats here when you get into Happy Hour, especially for groups and if there is a special cask or beer party on that night? Good luck.

Food:
I hadn't been here in a while and lookit that, they updated their menu. Fine selection of platters for sharing, with all the fine things in life: pickles, olives, fine cheeses and breads, preserves, charcuterie, nuts. Our round-the-world all of the above platter was $18 but everything on it was great, unlike other establishments I have recently graced (ahem Bier Markt King). Good for sharing with two people, not more, as the samples came in twos. The prices are comparable to other upscale beer places and frankly, in this case you get what you pay for.

Beer:
A fantastic selection of Ontario craft beers and some others. Casks are always rotating so there's always something new to try. The best thing? Ordering flights, which I have only been able to do here and at the Beer Bistro on King. Three little cups of beer for the price of one, to maximize you adventure into the great beer frontier. Yum!

Service:
The servers also legitimately KNOW about beer (not just the bartender, shock!). They know the list on the blackboard and they know the difference between and pilsner and an ale, so when you ask for a flight and you say, Surprise me with a variety, you will legit GET a variety of beer. Plus when they lay them down in front of you, they will honest to goodness know all three or more of the beer by sight alone, sans labels. 

Location:
A five minute walk from Wellesly subway stop, you can definitely walk here in painful shoes if you so desire. Even a directionally challenged suburbanite can find it. But! A caveat! Volo is so hip it doesn't have a sign (psht signs are for box bars, didn't you know), so peel those eyeballs for ivy crawling up a wall on Yonge.
 
Overall:
I have said it already. If you haven't gone yet, leave now."}
{"text":"This is my favourite bar in the city. The craft beer selection is unmatched, the food is delicious, and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Go early to get a seat. Oh, and it's super loud."}
{"text":"With a long weekend back home in the States, I decided to head north to Toronto armed with a list of suggestions from the lovely Kat F.  Great selection of beers here, with all genres represented.  The taps are centered on microbrews, but the list of bottles offered a lot of favorites from around the world.  The food I saw going by looked pretty good; unfortunately the vegetable pasta I ordered was kind of bland.  It's a cozy little place filled with wooden benches and tables, but there's also a nice outdoor space which was just great on an early summer night."}
{"text":"Not a fan  of  the new self-serve. Table was dirty and I have to wait in line while my friend holds the table?  Not a great place to kick back and relax since you spend most of your time waiting in line to order every time you want another drink.  Had the pulled pork sandwich which was absolutely gross. It was one big lump of mush like a pate.  Only good thing was the beer. But even that seems to have diminished since they've made the changes. Very disappointed.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm a regular patron. If they still had their vegan board, I'd be there everyday (and for a while, I was). Sadly, it was retired, along with their amazing pulled pork sandwich, when the menu was significantly reduced. 

The amazing beer selection is obviously the major selling point. If you like microbrewery beer and want to continually try new selections, this is the place to go: ~30 on tap (6 cask), changing daily, and dozens (including rare selections) in bottle.  It's the perfect place to spend your Saturday or Sunday afternoon with a friend or two. My only real complaints is that it's too small to house all the people who want to be there! That, and their new patio set up of picnic table creates more seats, but makes sharing tables much less pleasant, since those seated in the middle continually have to ask those on the sides to get up when they need to get out. Which, let's be honest, is pretty often at a self-serve bar.

Tip: If you're a lady beer drinker, like I am, don't bother asking for recommendations: all the servers will recommend Dieu du Ciel's hibiscus beer (aka: the pink beer)."}
{"text":"A great place! Over 30 different beers on tap including their own cask options. \"boards\" are a great way to try all kinds of meats and pickled items. Larger meal options are also fantastic. Had the pulled pork and club and very pleased with both. Also highly recommend ending the meal with a bottle Stout for the table."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out, but I'm afraid my experience was ruined by our terrible server. We chatted with the neighboring table and they were getting terrible service as well.

Here's the rundown:
1. Gave us the beer list without the list inside, just a cover.
2. When my female friends asked if there were mixed drinks (fair question, even if its a beer bar, no?) He replies \"this is a beer bar\". Snarky.
3. Slowwwww service and hard to get his attention.
4. Gave us the wrong pizza, but it took so long we decided to let the mistake slide and just eat it. He comes over a few minutes later and exclaims 'Shit I gave them the wrong pizza' and runs away. Runs away, BUT doesn't get us the right pizza. We end up flagging him down and he asks 'Did you want me to get the right pizza?'. 

Needless to say, we leave after 1 beer. I may give it another try because the beer list was massive and the food was good, but quality establishments have a responsibility to keep quality staff."}
{"text":"I'm from Vancouver and the beer scene in Toronto is somewhat lacking in comparison. Luckily Bar Volo exists. Very good selection of Great Lakes area beers and breweries. The taps and casks are a good selection of mostly regional stuff. I was really happy with the beers I tried considering I chose blindly from the list on the wall. Some premium bottles look good but I will come back with a larger group since the rare bottles (which I am interested in) are expensive. I'd like to try some but it's best to try a handful and split the cost if you're interested in that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Fabulous spot on yonge street patio is covered if its raining cozy inside. Food was fresh however needs more waitstaff the bartender served us after a long wait. When our order was taken it was a long wait and things where forgotten but  when they did arrive calamari was fresh beer was good they have a large list of specialty beers and we discovered they have beer tastings mmm."}
{"text":"Huge selection of craft beer! The food was a little slow to come out, but it disappeared very soon once on the table! service was great. It was very busy and no space on the patio. Inside is nice too.

You can pay as you go or put everything on tap. You have to go to the bar to order and there was a long lineup soon enough. A mix of sit-down and bar (because the food is served).

Nonetheless, loved the food and drinks. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite bars in toronto. It's a great neighborhood spot with so many choices of beer. Food is great too!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I know this place is all about the beer, but I'm seriously a fan of the food. Everything I've tried has been delicious--the sandwiches, the pizzas, the pastas.  We've often had long waits for a table, but it's been well worth it.  Tasty food, lots of beer, friendly staff, and a cozy table on a cold night?  Yes, please."}
{"text":"Best selection of taps and bottled beer in the city, and it's no accident, Ralph works hard (against a certain unnamed liquor control board) to get us the best.

The atmosphere is cozy and organic, welcoming you with dimmed lights, brass accents and old woods.  The staff is incredible, and will always go out of their way to satisfy, even under the busiest conditions.  

There is a good variety of food for a beer-oriented pub and it is always well presented and tasty, but the real draw is the beer.  Close ties to local breweries mean the best selection of Ontario taps in the city, and with such superstars as Westveleteren ABT 12 and Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti gracing the bottle list this summer, there's no shortage of fine brews.  

Volo is pricey, but the selection of beer and wonderful genial atmosphere, makes it my favourite place in the city to sit and enjoy a pint. Ninkasi, the Sumerian goddess of beer, would be proud."}
{"text":"I really love the variety of beers they have - changing the featured beer every day. On four visits within à week I found different tap beer lists each time. The downside is, that there are sometimes very similar beers - for example there was no relly hoppy beer on when I last visited."}
{"text":"Best beer bar in town.  Local and imported craft beers as well as seasonal cask ales.

New menu in the past few months with great sandwiches.  In particular I recommend the sausage sandwich which is made from beautifully seasoned sliced and sauteed sausage mixed with onions, roasted red peppers, and what seems to be a home made dark mustard on the side. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best beer selection I've ever seen and great ambiance. I would come back to Toronto just to go to this place."}
{"text":"Probably the best bar in Toronto! 

This bar is for serious beer drinkers. They have great beer selection and awesome staff. Very nice patio with really cool vibe. You could tell from the photos wether you would like this place or not. Most people come here to enjoy a pint of fancy beer."}
{"text":"The bartenders/servers need to do a little homework on their glassware: 

Amsterdam Dodoens Pale 8.4% (a Belgian style IPA) was served in a standard white wine glass. Really?

Denisons Weissbier (a German Hefeweizen, a.k.a. white beer or wheat beer) was incorrectly served in an English pint glass instead of the correct weizen glass: a tall, narrow glass which accentuates the distinct haziness and thick head formation of this particular style.

King Pilsener (a Czech Pilsener), again, arrived in a generic English pint glass. A Pilsener should ideally be served in a tall thin fluted glass to show off the characteristically light, sparkling colour of this beer style. A narrow glass will also compensate for a less pronounced head (typical in Pilseners) --which tends to rapidly disappear when served in a much wider English style pint glass.

Achel 8 Blond (a Belgian Trappist strong ale) served with a tulip glass instead of the correctly paired goblet or chalice glass, which tends to emphasize the complex aromas inherent with Trappist ales. 

Great place otherwise. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to enjoy a wide variety of beers. A weekly updated beer menu. Very helpful and friendly staff. Hands down my favorite place in the city to enjoy a pint of whatever I happen to be craving at the time. The interior is cozy and interesting (check in the table drawers for messages left by past patrons). Rarely is it full to the point where you consider going elsewhere. For anyone looking to enjoy a few (great) beers with friends in a relaxed and comfortable environment, Cafe Volo is the best place in Toronto."}
{"text":"New emphasis is on craft beers + many many different bottled beers.
Limited but tasty menu of breads, cheese & meats. Pasta & Pizza.
Gets very busy in the early evening so prepare to share a table and enjoy their company."}
{"text":"Nice Patio, Great list of Beers, and fairly tasty food. Tonight I had the Bruchetta and the sampler plate (cheese, meats, etc) Tasty. Service was excellent and helpful in describing beer choices. One of the few nice locations on Yonge between Dundas and Bloor."}
{"text":"I've been to volo a few times now and have never loved it quite as much as I want to. Until now. 

My most recent visit was excellent. I'm a big ol' beer nerd and worked at another of the  Toronto beer restos for a couple years, so my expectations can be a bit high. On my previous visits I've been completely disappointed with the level of beer knowledge the staff were willing to share with me (they may know more than they let on, who knows?). 

My most recent visit, though, we had two fellas serving us and both were knowledgable and happy to talk beer. They were also friendly, attentive and playful, which is nice.

This visit was late on a Saturday afternoon, rather than during later, busier hours, so perhaps that accounts for the excellent service. Whatever the reason, I was delighted, and I can be a tough nut about service.

It goes without saying (or would, if I let it) that the draft beer selection is brilliant, especially the selection of cask ales. I gulped a black oak ten bitter years, which was golden and hoppy and made my whole mouth happy."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! Don't go here. Went with my girlfriend to grab some dinner the other night. When we arrived they only had patio seating available, it was chilly so we turned it down and decided to wait til something opened up inside. Bought 2 outrageously overpriced beers for $17 and waited about 20 minutes til we were seated at the smallest circular table in the restaurant, tucked away between the patio door and the wall. 15 minutes after being seated our waiter came over and FINALLY gave us menus; we sat for 15 minutes nursing our beers before being able to even glimpse at the menu. I had looked at the menu online before going and it was fairly extensive, the menu we received upon sitting gave a selection of only 7 cheese plates and 7 sandwiches, all $15 or more (and they were out of bison). 15 DOLLARS FOR A SANDWICH!!!! We placed our order, deciding to split a board and order a couple sandwiches. We sat and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. A HALF HOUR LATER, THE SERVER CAME OVER AND SAID \"WE SCREWED UP AND NEVER PUT YOUR ORDER IN, IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU?\" I glared at him and said \"Well we've been here starving for over an hour now, what can you do for us?\" THE WAITER SAID \"WELL THERE'S NOTHING I CAN REALLY DO FOR YOU ACTUALLY.\" COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!! AND NO ATTEMPT TO EVEN RELIEVE THE SITUATION!!!! We left in a rage and went to the W Burger Bar right down the street on College and had an extremely delicious and prompt meal (our appetizer came out minutes after placing our order).

LONG STORY SHORT: HORRIBLE, UNFRIENDLY STAFF, OVERPRICED FOOD, NOT NEARLY ENOUGH BAR OR SEATING SPACE. DON'T EAT HERE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favourite go-to beer watering hole in Toronto. I love the craft beer options going alphabetically and the option of having smaller pours than a pint.

I am disappointed that it closed... Maybe because I  loved it a lot that Birreria Volo can't compete for me (I also like boxed squareness of Bar Volo). I also really enjoyed that they had cask ale options. Hopefully they will open a new location soon.

However, I cannot trust them with keeping a tab. I had one poor experience where I was overcharged (I knew I had x number of half pints...not x+2). I could have argued with them however we were in a rush and I couldn't remember all the beers I had (it wasn't overcharged by much). I won't put a minus for this as it was one occurrence, but from now on, personally don't trust on putting a tab (especially for busy bars)."}
{"text":"Feel like a pirate aboard a mighty ship, stocked high with ales, lagers, and golden wheat brews listed on a chalkboard tally board along the wall. Grip the rustic wooden rails as you clamor towards the bar and plunk thyself upon a plank bench with your fellow mates aboard the Barvolo. Look up, rickety lamps sway as your pint glasses empty. Around the communal tables you garble over the raucous roar of strange jobbing pirates nibbling salted nuts and meats for the long journey. Tough beef jerky grips your molars coming off in strings. Mummified meat in mason jar vessels. No meals during off peak times - salt snacks only! 
Slake your thirst with local and foreign biers on tap or by the bottle. TIS but a few that can be acquired at ye olde LCBO shoppe. You relieve yourself past the kegs and barrels below deck in the dark underbelly of the vessel, only to reemerge in the galleys to swill more ale whilst the high seas thrash the room about in a spinning haze of merriment and then you realize. Pirates drink rum. :( 

Points off fer not havin the full menu for a Monday's eve. And no serving wenches."}
{"text":"This is my favourite and best place to get a beer in Toronto. They always have an excellent rotating selection of microbrews, including cask ales. The staff are very friendly and know their beer!

There is good people watching on Yonge St too.

I've had the food here and it's decent, but I really only come here for beer."}
{"text":"Great beer selection!  it's definitely a great place to go to... however...the lack of staff and the fact that  you have to go order at the bar is a hassle, especially when the place is packed (which is almost always).

I would give it 5 stars if they had staff and more space.  

Word has been spoken."}
{"text":"Just go there for the atmosphere and beers. The food is not good and the staff are not polite."}
{"text":"If you love beer, Volo is one of those places you wish there were more of in Toronto.  A new player in the market may perfect the model and score 5 stars. But, until that happens, Volo is still a solid choice.

The selection on the blackboard is a revolving door of somewhat-known and unknown local draughts and cask ales. There's always something good up there so ask the waiter what they recommend.

If you're looking for a wider selection, open the extensive beer menu and peruse through the hundreds of national and international bottles. My only recommendation is to jump out of your comfort zone and try something different!

I generally haven't eaten dinner at Volo and, if you're hungry, I suggest going for after-dinner drinks. The portions are usually pretty small and the kitchen must be tiny, as well, since if there's more than one table ordering food you can expect to wait 30-60 minutes for your meal. The food choices are unique and high quality (like the establishment, itself) so go ahead and order a few apps if you're nippish and plan to stay awhile.

Note 1: The patio makes up about 50% of Volo's capacity, so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table, especially in the winter.

Note 2: This is one of the few places in Toronto that accepts credit cards, but NOT Mastercard (both VISA and American Express are fine). I've never found out the reason..."}
{"text":"A very nice neighborhood bar on Yonge street. A very nice selection of beers, and a limited but tasty menu. Few of the waiters know and can explain the origin and taste of each beer which  I found fascinating. The kitchen is a bit slow.. so dont come if you are in a rush.. come to sit, meet locals, drink a good beer and eat some nice 'italian concept' food. i like the salad, vegi pizza and calamari... 

During the summer when the Patio is open... ensure this is where you sit..."}
{"text":"Barvolo is a small diamond in the rough. This unique bar restaurant is the ideal meeting place when you want a quick drink. Definitely ideal for those in their 20s or 30s. The bar features nearly 90 beers on tap-given we only tried two- they were still top-notch. The service was kind, quick as well. You order all food and drinks at the bar, so there really are no waiters for each table. Not a place if you want a hearty meal, though the club and blt are great for a quick lunch. Perfect for a nice beer and bite before a big night or a beautiful walk about town- gets BUSY after 6. Better environment to chat beforehand."}
{"text":"We wandered in having not been here since it was called the Brownstone. They have a large selection of craft brews. Some are quite expensive about $6.75 for the half pint. 

We ordered a starter of 3 dips and two bison burgers. 

You know when you have a bag of nachos and there's a bunch of broken chips in the bottom of the bag? Well, they gave those to us in a little bowl and the dips weren't much larger than a toonie. It was $10 and we felt very ripped off. 

Next came the bison burgers. They were greasy and undercooked. I've never had a greasy bison burger before. It's suppose to be a very lean meat. We sent one back that they took off our bill. The other bison burger didn't have a whole lot of flavor to it. The burgers were $15 and you only got a small coleslaw and 2 pickles with it. 

If you want to sample some new beers I would suggest that you check it out. If you want to have dinner go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Cozy, quaint bar with an extensive selection of beer. Great place for a first date. Credit card minimum is annoying."}
{"text":"The cheese and meat platter is incredible. Their mushroom pasta is a religious experience. I love the cozy vibe and a great place to have a drink on a date or with friends."}
{"text":"This place has been here a while and is a must visit before they close in September. It is fairly busy in the evenings so be prepared to wait ten minutes with a beer in hand for a spot. Amazing selection of beer and and great service as always from the staff. If you're hungry go for the food. Great Italian esque selections. If you're really hungry go for the baller board. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"After discovering Bar Volo a few years ago by fluke, it has, hands down, become one of my favourite neighbourhood spots in Toronto. Set within the Yonge and Wellsley area, Bar Volo is an outcast amongst the seedy stores that run along Yonge St. 

With their extensive beer menu, you'll be able to find something for all tastes although avoid an end-of-the-night run to Volo on weekends as they've usually tapped out of their popular beers. 

My fave local beer: Ontario's Denison Weissbier. It's a nice refreshing change from the local Mill St. Beers.

My fave imported beer: Belgium's St. Paul Triple Croc. At 7.6% alcohol and $20+ a bottle, this import makes for a good share. The swing top ceramic bottle is a cool bonus.

The Food: I've only eaten one meal at Volo before a concert at the neighbouring Massey Hall. Portions are small and food is a bit on the pricey side but tasty nonetheless. If I could do it again I'd buy more beer, spend less on the food and grab a slice of pizza around the corner.

Volo is great for a drink on a low-key night or perfect as part of a tour of of the few micro-breweries in the city. Go!"}
{"text":"Volo is a great bar! I have long discounted bars on yonge street south of bloor as too touristy (or possibly to seedy) but thanks to Volo I am a changed man.

As mentioned in other reviews, Volo has an extensive beer list but it also has an extensive list of whiskeys. Being a whiskey fan, I was very impressed with the list and there were a more than a few that I have never even heard of.

The food seemed ok. I split their 'assortito' plate of meats and cheese and it wasn't remarkable but wasn't bad either.

The service was also great (though perhaps because my friend was shamelessly flirting with her?) and our server made some great recommendations."}
{"text":"One of the nicer bars in this area, with a good selecting of draughts. I have been to their cask festival two years in a row and I enjoy their selection. The food menu has changed over the years (drastically) and now I find it somewhat pricey. But then this is not a generic watering hole and people seem willing to pay slightly higher prices just to be here. I am not fully convinced. :)"}
{"text":"I just like this place. A lot. 

The selection of craft beers is fantastic and the knowledgeable staff is even more fantastic. It's one of the very few places in the world that I have been to where the servers can explain the difference between hops and brewing styles. I appreciate that. 

The menu is not that extensive but it doesn't matter as I get the same thing every time -- the putanesca with added chicken. Can't find it the way they do anywhere else. The grilled calamari also gets the nod.

In the summer, the patio is perfect for people watching. In the winter, the inside of the place feels like a cozy chalet. Prices are very reasonable, but not cheap.

The only downside is that they only accept Visa and cash, not Mastercard."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's easily a top 3 bar in Toronto, and on any given day can be the best bar in the city.
The quality of the beer on the menu is second to none.  Other bars have more beer choice, but none can match Volo for quality.  The odd draught cider is also a nice surprise too.

One thing that has changed in recent months is the kitchen.  The food here has greatly improved.  The pulled pork and the club are the stand out sandwiches and the charcuterie is excellent.

The clientele is great, not hipster at all. Friendly, eccentric beer lovers.  And the staff are just the same.  The place itself is rustic, warm and welcoming with plethora of old wood.

If you are from out of town; go here, this is a Toronto gem. If you are a local, and you like beer; shame on you!  Get you a$$ to Volo!"}
{"text":"This place as a great beer selection but a little pricy. The food is more for snacking but also overpriced.  this place is tiny, and impossible to get a seat if the patio isn't open.  lastly, it's a self service kind of place so you have to go up the the incredibly cramped bar to get your drinks, and then carry them back which if you're on the patio is really annoying."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! 
The bartenders know their beers and are great with recommendations. The place is quaint and cozy. Its small though, so sometimes difficult to find a place to sit."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite place to go to for brunch on Sunday's specially in the patio in the summer.
The place it's very inviting and the menu is not confusion or too long like in some places that you have to go for days through the list until you just find something random to not let the waiter wait longer -sorry for the wait waiter- to get your order.
I usually have an orange juice and some organic beef burger and salad when I go. 
Recommended."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Barvolo. This is my go-to biweekly place. Pre or post their menu contains a wide array of options, after a couple of drinks you are left wondering what the others have to offer. Go up to the bartender and tell them precisely what you are looking for and you won't be disappointed. Yes one can get confused with the number of options present but if you don't try, you will never know.....Right?"}
{"text":"Wicked drink selection, cool aesthetic and friendly staff. Definitely a place to go if you're really into beer."}
{"text":"Wow what a selection of craft beer. Have only had the beers and the beer menu has got to be one of the best in the city by far. Really liked their in house nano brews and the owner Ralph is a nice guy to boot. Great atmosphere too. What more do you want in a watering hole? Worth the trip to Yonge St."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great beers and music. Funky atmosphere.  Patio is primo in the summertime."}
{"text":"I like this bar. A LOT.

It's small and cozy, with dim lighting. Great place for a date or catching up with an old friend.

The food is really, really good. I had the vegetable sandwich - served with DE-lish roasted potatoes and salad for $11. And I have to be honest - I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, but the food was seriously very good.

The staff are incredibly nice and knowledgable, which is a beautiful thing because the beer menu is extensive. Holy - I just realized I hadn't even mentioned the beer yet. So many options! I had a weissbier I'd never heard of but it hit the spot. This is a great place to try new beers and far less pretentious than Beer BIstro, and less douchy than Bier Markt."}
{"text":"I go to volo quite a bit and of course the beer and food is great but it should be mentioned that the staff are also very good. Ask them about what they think you'd like, they're surprisingly good at helping people choose what to order from their massive beer menu."}
{"text":"A very classy place just that it gets a lil crowded and doesn't have too much sitting space."}
{"text":"Very busy. It took a while to get a seat, but it was worth the wait. Very good selection of beers. The food was outstanding. Most delicious rabbit terrine I have had in a long time. The duck liver pate was also excellent."}
{"text":"My favorite beer bar in Toronto. A huge and quality rotating selection of local craft beers. Also great charcuterie boards. Try the Baller Board."}
{"text":"My crew was pretty rambunctious for this place but we managed to not get kicked out. By rambunctious, I mean switching tables, being loud, not knowing what to get with 20 minutes until the kitchen closed and I believe someone's order was, \"Whatever is your favourite. But wait- not any of that expensive sh*t\". We stumbled upon this place and boy, I bet they wish we hadn't. 

Anywho, the drink menu is extensive but I didn't tap into that. Instead I craved a Sprite and a margarita pizza at the end of the night. The pizza was delectable! It came on a flatbread-ish crust, was saucy and delicious with various cheeses (goat cheese!) and spices. There was also a miniature balsamic vinaigrette salad that was not advertised but a welcome addition. Who orders a Sprite at a bar? I have no explanation but it washed everything down nicely. 

Our server was excellent. Dreamy, knowlegable and most importantly on this occasion, tolerant. Everything went smoothly; the only kink was one bill for 10 people which is never too fun to deal with."}
{"text":"If you're trying to decide on a place to try out, look no further. Volo is my go-to bar when in Toronto. The bar is rustic and on the smaller side which lends to its charm and cozy atmosphere. There is an outdoor patio perfect for warmer nights. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about the booze selection. Make sure to bring cash or have visa, kind of annoying they don't accept Amex. 
Seating is limited, food is good and drinks are great."}
{"text":"The best selection of beer in Toronto, hands down. When you want nothing but beer, this is the place!! This is where I first tried Dieu du Ciel Rosée d'hibiscus and I was in love. They had it on tap for a while then it disappeared, as they normally change it up according to supply and season. This is THE place to try something new and exciting, support your local breweries and discover some from the old country. My go to bar when I'm downtown."}
{"text":"Cool, neat, original place with its own 'family-run' vibe, and kind of a beer geek hangout with unique events. Constantly trying out new ideas.

Agree about some irrational prices, the awkward layout with weird seating (Bar what Bar there's no bar to sit at LOL) and there have been some hit-and-miss meals and others that were great.

But Bar Volo is both an originator and a contributor to the scene in a lot of important ways. I'll stop there any time (just watching where I park.)"}
{"text":"A very charming, intimate and classy family owned restaurant. They have a large selection of draft beer (over 30 taps) in addition to their own beer. If you're not feeling beer, there's many great cocktails and bourbon options. They have a very spacious patio that is open and always busy during the summer. The service is very good; the staff are all very friendly and approachable. My only criticism is that you have to order and pay at the bar."}
{"text":"Volo still has the best and most interesting beer selection in the city... but it isn't what it used to be.

First the good...

With a great mix of international and local beers there is always something on the menu that I haven't tried before. It's got a neat vibe and has a great patio in the summer. I love coming here for a beer after work with friends or for a drink after dinner.

With the awesome part out of the way... 

The food selection has really gone downhill in the last couple of years.  They have made space for brewing equipment at the expense of having a real kitchen.  The result is that their delicious pastas and other dinner options have disappeared and have been replaced with cheese boards and sandwiches which feel like you are getting ripped off.  The servings are small verging on tiny.

I know a lot about beer, so maybe I am picky, but I used to feel like the staff here knew as much as I do. They could always make great recommendations for me. Now the staff is hit or miss.  Some are knowledgeable and some have no idea.  I recently had one of the servers recommend a sour beer to a friend who had asked for something \"normal\" and \"like a lager\".  I was not impressed.

This used to be a place where I could happily spend a whole night.  Now I am only interested in a drink or two before moving on for the evening."}
{"text":"I came here for a one-and-done per a recommendation from a friend. I really wish I had stayed. Bar Volo has that vibe of professionalism mixed with a easygoing nature that attracts clientele from all avenues. Walking confused into the this dark bar consisting of mainly wood and chalkboards, I was greeted with a smile and given proper direction and information to their drink menu, food, and serving style. It was quite pleasing.

I'm not a beer expert so I needed a recommendation to go along with the Cacciatore Sausage that caught my eye from their clipboard-menu. Without much thought the bartender recommended an IPA. This beer would \"cut the fattiness of the meat, but can still enjoy the flavor, and the hoppiness would bring out the spice.\" I went with that recommendation and ordered their Quebec IPA. I sat outside on the patio area, was served my beer and small plate, and dug right in.

Everything tasted just the way he explained. I loved it all, and I plowed through it. 

I wish I ordered a second app and pairing, but the tourist in me wanted to run along and see where else I can explore before my day ended. With their great menu, variety of beers, and knowledgeable staff, you really can't go wrong with this place. I look forward to checking this place out again... before they move."}
{"text":"Not the best first impression... But you sounded so good in your profile.

Volo has beer.
Lots and lots of beer.
Beer specials.
Beers on tap.
Bottled beer from everywhere.
Beer bottles for decor.
If you don't like beer then you really shouldn't be here.

I know this place is better for pints than food, but WTF.
How do you run out of pizza?
How do you run out of everything?

Olives, grilled vegetables, and little blocks of cheese do not go well with beer.  Bruschetta is also not that satisfying with beer.

The fact that I was STARVING probably dampened my experience.
*chucks olive back at Volo's face*

This place is a nice laid back hang out with chill rock tunes.
The staff knows a lot about beer... but aren't very friendly and they are the opposite of a pleasure to talk to. 
I enjoy Beer Bistro so much more, why can't you be more like Beer Bistro.

Also, you may want to dress down, instead of just any ol' t-shirt, bust out your rattiest t-shirt in the back of your closet.

I'm sure I'll be back, because of the cool patio and beer selection.
But I need some time to recover from my lame first experience.

Hi Volo; 
We can be friends (Maybe).
Send me a note on Facebook sometime.
I thought you'd be taller.
I'll get over it (Maybe)."}
{"text":"i love this place!!!  Beer selection is fantastic, helpful staff and yummy finger food for sharing (and some good sandwiches too!)!!  I bring my friends here all the time when someone suggests \"let's go for drinks!\".  I also really like the patio and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant - very rustic meets industrial kind of feel.  Gets quite loud when you go during the weekend - or maybe it's just me being loud and drinking away!

I highly recommend!  :)"}
{"text":"Very cool bar with an awesome patio!

They mostly serve microbrews here and their menu is comprehensive, although a little hard to see as the bar itself is quite dark. Good service from the bartender (you have to order from the bar, no waiter service) and they take cards for transactions over $10.

Not a bad place for a quick pint if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night with a couple friends after a long drive from the Detroit metro area. Definitely a nice way to spend our first evening in Toronto. 

How it works: You pick up the list at the entrance and mark with the pencil, what you want. Everything, including food, is ordered to the bar. You're given a number and take it back to your seat.

Ambiance: I loved it! Nice outdoor seating with enough artificial light combined with candles. Inside was darker but had a nice eclectic feel. Bench seating for some areas which I'm a big fan of. 

Food: Very good! We had the carpaccio and a couple crotinis - one with sardines and one that was simpler (apologies, don't remember). I think we were more a fan of the carpaccio (came with delicious capers)

Beer: a great selection! There are a lot of beers in bottles and quite a few on tap. A selection of Canadian and American microbrews. I had a tasty IPA. 

Price: As an out-of-towner, I'm not sure how expensive/inexpensive our visit was comparatively, but our meal cost $50 Canadian - 3 beers, 2 crostini orders, 1 carpaccio order. 

Enjoy Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I've been to Volo a couple of times with groups and have successfully scored long enough tables to accommodate our numbers.

They have a huge selection of beer - some listed on their chalkboard, some listed on the regular menu, and some listed on their discounted 'discontinued' menu.  The discontinued items are only available while quantities last, so take advantage of these great offers if you see anything you like.  The beer I tried to order was no longer available and our waiter was quick to suggest alternatives.  He also recommended beverages to others in my party based on what they were looking for.  He definitely proved he knows their product line very well.

Sadly, at the hour we arrived, the kitchen was already closed.  The best our waiter could do was offer us a side of olives, but they happen to be one of the few items on my 'Foods I Dislike' list.

Volo is a great place to relax with friends and have a drink (or many).  It's small and can get busy, so be prepared to wait or squeeze if you're in a large group.

The washroom situation is a little sketchy."}
{"text":"Was expecting better from this place given the rating and reviews on here, but was unfortunately quite disappointed.

The beer was good, I can say that much... nice selection and fresh options from Ontario and nearby breweries.   If you're looking for beer and you're in the area, I might actually recommend this place.

But my nice review ends there.   My wife and I were in the area and were interested in some nice pub food for dinner that wasn't from a chain restaurant (it was about 5pm on a Saturday) and walked by this place, looked busy (usually a good sign) and the Yelp reviews were right, so we went in.

We tried the house burger and the pulled pork sandwich, both came with chips (expected fries, should have read the menu better.. but relatively impossible with the lighting in there).   Both were quite tiny and the mix of flavors strange and overpowering... my burger was also undercooked, which led to an upset stomach for the rest of the night... fun!

My wife had a can of diet coke.. for $4.. thanks for that.   In total our bill for a pint of beer, the two sandwiches and the can of diet coke came to $48.  Not worth it at all! Especially given the upset stomachs we both had afterwards.

The atmosphere is very loud, with people yelling over each other by about 6pm, and very dimly lit (relative to other bars/pubs I've been to in the area).   Got a hipster vibe from the clientele in there at the time. (not a negative, just worth noting).  Not a nice place to stop in for a bite for dinner in my opinion.

The guys next to us were talking about how the place used to be a nice italian eatery a dozen or so years ago, but has reduced its focus to beer selection in recent years.

If you are looking for beer and a loud place to meet with a couple friends over a shared plate of charcuterie... then you might consider this place, just don't come for the food!   Unfortunately I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my second time in Volo, this time much earlier in the day (we arrived at around 4PM). In such an early our its a 'order at the bar' experience, but a very lovely one. The bartender did his best in matching us with the beer we'd enjoy, and the beers were indeed a success. The place has a great, not too loud, music which is great for ambiance and yet does not interfere with the talking. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite pub in the city. 

It serves mostly local beers, and by local I mean that little brewery just north of Toronto that no one else in the city serves, kind of local. All of it is listed on a chalk board. It really is a beer snob's dream.

They have a cozy little patio and the seating inside is mostly wooden benches. 

If you haven't checked it out, add it to you list. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"FatCat almost rear-end BMW today because very short mini skirt twisting FatCats eye balls away from road.  FatCat be very careful on roads from now on..  FatCat glad bar volo open patio.  FatCat now go to bar volo patio to enjoy scenery on Yonge street instead of driving around in his CatMobile.

Things FatCat like
 - Many beers new to FatCat on tap.  Very exciting for FatCat
 - Location + Nice big patio right on Yonge street
 - FatCat not try food at BarVolo.. so 5 star rating only for beer and atmosphere.

Things FatCat not like
 - Too small when patio not open in winter. FatCat go only in summer because of this. Place very popular..

This time of year always very dangerous for FatCat.  Other fat cats... also please drive carefully..  FatCat making pledge to not get hypnotized by short skirts anymore when driving..

SIDE STORY: FatCat finally get to bottom of Canada Goose issue..  (See FatCat review for Hemmingway for why FatCat concerned about Canada Goose)

This time FatCat suspicion is right.. This is very big cult.. and not just in Canada... Global.  But not worry too much..  Not dangerous cult.  

FatCat investigation find that people not buying jackets because of cold weather.  People buying jackets because jacket coming with big seal of approval. Cult members thinking \"I approve of you dressing like me because it make me feel better to be part of big crowd, even though part of me really hate you for having newer jacket with bigger seal.\"

FatCat not too concerned about Canada Goose cult.  Just make sure he not fall into trap himself..  FatCat good investigator.."}
{"text":"If you wear glasses without lenses, plaid shirts and have ever used the sentence \"you've probably never heard of it\"...this is your mecca.  Hipster douchbags rejoice, you have found your holy land!  If you just want a beer...a normal beer...don't even walk by this place or you will be intoxicated simply by the air of uptight pretense wafting out.  

I'm not saying the beer is bad, some of their crafts are actually quite nice...but the crowd and staff aren't worth it.  It's like being stuck at Fraser Crane's wine tastings."}
{"text":"Volo is the 'east end' as far as I am concerned. It's on the East side of Yonge Street, so I can't say I'm there much. But luckily I was taken there by a friend who lives even further east than Yonge! I got a flight of beers, which was amazing. The staff know their beer and the menu is kept up to date with seasonal selections all year round.  A large number of beers from Ontario and Quebec, which both produce some serious brews (in alcohol % and level of interest).  

The second time I was nearby, I dragged a group of out of towners in for a little mixing and mingling. The space is split up into the upstairs by the bar, tables with table service and the patio, weather permitting.  The barman was offering samples to my cider-drinking friends, but I knew what I wanted off the chalkboard menu.  

Volo also hosts Boutique beer nights, tutored tastings and music. Not much to improve, but make it patio weather every day!"}
{"text":"Excellent local craft selection. Plenty of cantillon in bottles! Great ambience. Outdoor patio is fantastic. Didn't try the food but it smells great. I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place has potential. Wasn't too impressed. This was definitely one restaurant where I don't agree with the Yelp rating. 

Tapas style restaurant with plenty of beer to choose from. You essentially have to choose a beer from a list on the wall and order at the bar. You also order your food at the bar which can be a nuisance.

They really need to expand. There's very minimal seating inside, with a communal patio outside. We went on a day that was thunder storming and instead of just not placing people outside like other courteous restaurants do, they seated us outside. And of course, 5 minutes later we were drenched. 

All in all, this place has huge potential. I'm sure the beers are great, and with an expansion and more seating inside, this place can do well."}
{"text":"Best beer spot in Toronto.  Plus local-ish food.  Small room so get here early or late.  Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Volo used to be my ultimate beer destination if I wanted to have one of my favourites or felt like trying something new. And don't get me wrong, they still do have one of the most extensive beer menus in town, covering the whole range from fruit flavoured kinds to stouts. 

However every time I go there it's never quite perfect. It's like they are on purpose trying to offset your blissful beer savouring session. It can be anything: a waiter who got up on the wrong side of the bed,  often non functioning urinals (I do hope the sign I saw the last time on the ladies' washroom saying \"Temporarily unisex. Sorry for the inconvenience\" was a joke by some prankster) and occasionally smelly washrooms, chronic shortage of menus, low stiff benches and high tables that never allow you lean back and relax properly, etc. And accepting only Visa or cash? I mean c'mon! Plus I don't find their food menu to be anything special and their bottled beer prices are about 30-35% higher than what they should be. 

All of this reminds me of what Dan's character in the movie \"Waiting...\" was preaching: The difference between ordinary and extraordinary, is that little extra. And this place certainly can be extraordinary with very little extra effort invested. Unfortunately whoever owns the places obviously doesn't care."}
{"text":"Love this place! From the casual atmosphere, to the beer, to the food. Service is warm and welcoming. Bonus points for having a nice, cozy patio too.

They've got a wide selection of beers on this giant chalkboard, each one corresponding to a letter in the alphabet. At the bar, they have a row of beer on tap labelled with each letter. Once you've decided on a beer, you can tell the bartender which \"letter\" you're ordering and they'll fill one up for you.

Here's a fun idea for a DIY beer sampler: Choose a word that has as many letters as there are people in your party. Now order a beer for each letter in the word and be surprised! Hopefully in a good way.

Bar Volo also has a great variety of small bites to go with your drinks. We opted for the Duck Liver Pate and the Charcuterie Board, which came with four types of regionally cured meats. Both of these dishes were fantastic; in taste, creativity and quality.

One of the highlights for us was actually the bread. It was so good that we finished the bread before the meat. FYI - They actually charge $5 for an extra basket of bread because a bakery in Toronto (forgot which one) exclusively ships to this restaurant, so they have a limited daily supply. We ordered it anyway because it just paired perfectly with the rest of the pate.

Whether you're an avid beer drinker or just thirsty and craving some good eats, Bar Volo will be right around the corner! Quite literally."}
{"text":"Though I'm not hugely into the beer/bar scene, I quite like Bar Volo. This place is unique, welcoming, modern, and cozy. You'll be amongst great people if you frequent this place. Of note, this bar does tend to be quite packed making casual drinks a bit difficult at times, but hey, that's a sign of a good hot spot, am I right? The beer and cider selections seem endless, with very knowledgeable staff. The beef carpaccio, of which I am a bit of a connoisseur, is also quite good, though strangely not offered with any sort of bread or crostini accompaniment."}
{"text":"- good selection of beer
- gotta order at the bar. no servers - which sucks
- very cramped place, and wish they'd turn the heat on (went on a sunday afternoon, and even with a decently full bar, it was freezing inside)"}
{"text":"The first time I ever visited Toronto, my interest in craft beer was just beginning to take hold. I did some asking around and heard that Volo was one of the places you just had to go if you wanted a bar that was positively mad about beer variety, with a great selection of beer from the USA, Canada and Europe. Having since moved to the city and ending up living only a few blocks from Volo, I can happily relate that this is absolutely accurate. The bottled beer list is broad and well-organized with something for everyone from West Coast hop lovers to Belgian enthusiasts. If you don't know where to start, the servers will be happy to give you some pointers. The taps offer even more variety on top of the bottled menu, and are often priced a bit better than some of the rarefied bottled items (especially on Mondays, when a pint off the tap list will run you $5.)

The true mark of a bar that wants to do right about beer, though, is Volo's commitment to local craft brewers. Ontario and Quebec-sourced small-batch and cask beers dominate the rotating tap list. Events like Cask Days, the IPA Challenge and the recently launched House Ales in-house brewing project carry the idea even further with their focus on local and locally collaborative beers of many styles.

They do a good job with their food menu, which features a number of traditional Italian items like tarrali (crisp pretzels,) arancini (rice balls,) cured meats, olives and a variety of pasta dishes. The \"boards\" and antipasti are a nice option if you're not feeling like a full meal but want something to nibble on with your drinks. There are also crisp-crusted pizzas (the Massino is my favourite), burgers (the Volo Burger is worth the extra dollar!) and a flipping good tuna melt to be found on the menu (ask for the hot peppers.) 

Though the space can get a bit cramped (especially in the wintertime when the patio is closed), it's got a nice ambiance (with brewery memorabilia hung all around) and the music isn't too loud but fits the social vibe of the place. Good to hang out with friends, perhaps not so good for an intimate dinner.

Volo is easily right at the top of the list for beer bars in Toronto along with Smokeless Joe's and the more upscale Beer Bistro. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love beer! And this place honours this wonderful beverage by offering a wide selection of beers from all over the world, with a heavy emphasis on Ontario craft beers.

Since we went on a Thursday night, their little patio just off Yonge was full, but not too full as to have us wait for a table. This place is fairly small so be prepared to wait on Friday, Saturday and Monday nights.

They have 15 beers on tap  that rotate on a regular basis, as well as an entire menu of bottled beers. The best way to try these fantastic brews is to order their craft beer trio sampler. For $6, you get three glasses of their different on-tap offerings. 

I asked our waiter, Justin, to bring me a random selection. Of the first three, the Muskoka Cream Ale stood out. A fantastic creamy tasting beer that goes down smooth. For round two, 3 more glasses, one of which was a wonderful Belgian Quadrupel.

The menu has a good selection for a late night snack.

Overall, this is a great place for beer lovers or to get your night started before heading out."}
{"text":"Great local. Really the only good local with a large selection of craft beer. The bf and I frequent often for a quick date night beverage. Never disappointed. Recently tried the Hisbiscus beer. Delish. I recommend the table by the window- people watching on Yonge is always a laugh."}
{"text":"Bar Volo (3.5 stars) - one of my top three Toronto beer pubs (Bar Hop #1). If you love craft beer (and charcuterie plates), this is the place for you. Best beer pub patio as well.

The Volo charcuterie plates are amazing, I absolutely love them. The perfect combination for craft beer. My favourite is the sausage plate - some of the best sausage I ever tried (and I'm German). In addition to your meat choices, you get cheese, bread, pickles and condiments. 

The beer selection is as good as any beer pub in Toronto, some would say the best. They brew their own beers, carry a large selection of limited run bottles and serve roughly 30 taps on a given day. Beer selections are heavily weighted toward Ontario & Quebec craft beers. 

I always feel like a kid in a candy store when reviewing the  Bar Volo beer menu displayed on the wall. If your there, look for me - I'm the guy standing in front of the menu with a big smile on my face.

So why a 3.5 star rating? Three things drive me absolutely crazy...

1) Bar service only. You have to go up to the bar and order every drink yourself. I absolutely detest this policy. Your having a great conversation with fellow beer drinkers and have to leave and stand in line for 10 minutes to get another beer. The more you drink, the greater annoyance this is. Needless to say, I get VERY annoyed!

2) Cash only - They have some specialty beers that can cost $20 - $40 / bottle. I often have to leave to find a Bank machine. This makes no sense to me.

3) No bar seating. I love sitting up at the bar discussing craft beers with the bartenders. It's where all the action should be in a craft beer pub.

Despite my pet peeves, I will always return when in the area for the diverse beer selection and sausage platter. 

BK"}
{"text":"you know when you want to give a good rating, but after thinking it through, the factors just don't really add up? that's Volo. i want to give it four stars, but it just doesn't add up: 

first the negatives:

- confusion upon entering. 'do we wait here? is someone going to seat us? hunh?'  

- we had to \"remind\" a server to bring us menus and he forgot to bring us the ice my friend asked for.

- the server corrected my pronunciation: \"bruschetta, vegetali sandwich with...,\" thereby making me into an ass for the second time that evening, and making my guest an ass too. i had ordered 'brewshedda' to appease my friend, who cringed at my version of 'bruschetta' when we were deciding what to order. i thought of the yelp thread on this very topic: http://www.yelp.ca/topic/toronto-pronouncing-foreign-food-words-in-english. and came to the conclusion, that you should go with the flow, thus the server shoulda just mirrored 'brewshedda'. 

- 'bruschetta' or 'brewshedda', it wasn't worth the syllables either way. the tomato-topping was over-compensated by garlic (and i do like my garlic). in retrospect, there really was no hope given the time of the year and tomato season. but the flatbread was no better. that is, its pale appearance, weak taste, and barely firm texture served only as a half-baked canvas. a slight brushing of oil before popping in the oven for 2 extra minutes might have saved it... during tomato season, duh. 

-  no one asked if i wanted another Williams cider

- it seemed like they were short-staffed. although, the older dude \"watching\" over the room probably could have solved a few service issues having to do with a full-house.

now, the positives:

- \"it's like Nova Scotia in here, in the good European way... not the trashy way,\" said my friend, visiting from Halifax. whatever, we both enjoyed the... erhm, \"European, Nova-Scotian\" ambiance.

- once we got the menus, both of us were really pleased with the offerings. noticing the sampler plates, we agreed they would be excellent for drinking nibblers. my friend announced she wanted to \"come again tomorrow!\", but i encouraged her to sample a bit more of what Toronto had to offer on her 3 day trip.

- my friend enjoyed the 'brewshedda', which is important to me because she's the guest here

- the vegetali sandwich meal was tasty and well-priced, including: toasted ciabatta with avocado, melted cheese, tomatoes; roasted red potatoes; and a salad. more than enough for a substantial dinner meal, heavy on the fat and carbs. For a couple extra bucks, I swapped the garden salad to a ceasar salad for my friend.

- chocolate beer! lots and lots of beer! but i don't drink beer. so, I appreciated that Volo had two ciders on tap. 

- service (apart from menu mishap) was knowledgeable, especially about the vast selection of beer. the bartender recommended a good \"hopsy\" beer for my friend. and our server was friendly.

after all of that, i will go back to Volo. I won't order the brewshedda, and I'll go with buds who like beer. I think just a few tweaks in service would boost my ranking of this place to a four or five star."}
{"text":"On a hot sunny day like today I happen to walk by this spot. Always meaning to try this spot due to the amazing beer list (rivals that of Beer Bistro) today seemed like a perfect day to kill some time and enjoy something to cool me down.
Initially the impression is that its very dark or maybe it was day time so they didn't have any lights on. 
There was only one bartender holding fort. I went straight for Orval as I have been meaning to try it for a while. It came to 12.50$ with taxes! pricey for a 330ml bottle if you ask me.  Orval was OK not amazing and was not served at the suggested temperature of 12-14C. 
I did go through the the food menu and its seems OK so I will try it out on the next trip.
Patio is tiny and is split into two areas sorta covered and open. 
I guess I will try their draught selection next time. 
3.5 Star overall."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the beer list at  Volo is extremely impressive. 
Lagers, ales, stouts, Ontario casks, porters - they have it all.

A friend and I met for a post-work drink and found the selection of beer to be overwhelming. Staff helped us narrow our choice down to the rosée d'hibiscus, from Montreal. Very light and fruity. We didn't try the food. 

Had perfect weather for sitting on the patio, which was quiet for a Tuesday night. Volo has a very relaxed atmosphere, right in the middle of Yonge St. chaos.

Will be back for $5 pint nights and the next tap rotation!"}
{"text":"$5 pints on Mondays! Who can argue with that? 

This place always has fantastic beer on tap and while it changes occasionally, a number of the beers have staying power (including my favourite, Denisons Wiessbier). 

The staff has a great handle on the beer and can always make substitutions based on what you're looking for. The times I've ordered wine, the staff were also incredibly helpful (but let's be honest, I mostly stick to their stellar selection of beer).

On top of the expert advice and the excellent beer selection, the food is tasty! I normally stick to their pizzas but the other items have also been great. The food is a little expensive for the portions (a little small) but the tastiness helps make up for it. 

The vibe is relaxed but nice. Not too loud. A great place for a cozy date or a long talk with an old friend when you've found yourself near the village or lost on Yonge St somewhere."}
{"text":"I`ve never felt under-dressed at a bar before but I did when i came here last week.

 I like Bar Volo because it has millions of craft beer! Millions. I do love all the variety. Also on Monday`s they used to have $5 pints for all their beers. Amazing! 

Decor and food seem a tad prentetious and it seems like a bar that the well-heeled people go after work for pints and flirting."}
{"text":"The beer selection here is definitely ideal that's worth four stars. Where it loses is for me is the cramped and narrow layout and how you have to push and shove to get to the bar to order ur drinks or atleast it Feels that wAy. They do have a great location right north of yonge and wellesly near subway which is great it just feels impossible to get a spot to sit on a busy night which is standard on Fridays, however with the amount of bars dT it was not long where we decided to take ourselves elsewhere. That being said it looks like a good watering hole with an exceptional selection of beers on tap  so we will return on a less busy night."}
{"text":"Came here on the last day and it was packed wall to wall. Has a great vibe and a unique list of drinks, each labelled with a letter from the alphabet. I was looking for something fruity and citrus-y and was recommended the letter P. The letter O was more up my alley, with a sour twist. Loved their outside patio."}
{"text":"One of my two favorite places downtown Toronto for a surefire treat for the pallet.  The house beers are solid and they always bring in the best of what is available.  I have had over a dozen positive experiences with beer and friends here.  They also get props for their work on Cask Days (not to be missed) and all their colabs thorough the year.  Best enjoyed on a sunny afternoon on the patio after work!"}
{"text":"Beer lover's paradise. Amazing ambience. Great staff. What's not to love?  Truly s hidden gem."}
{"text":"I just had THA BEST dinner at Bar Volo last night. Yes, charcuterie, cheese and kettle chips does count as dinner in my books.

Don't want to read the entire thing, here's the summary: NOM NOM NOM

I got to the bar around 7:45pm trying to discretely mask my shopping addiction by throwing my scarf on top of an HBC shopping bag (this is relevant to the review, I promise). I was greeted by a nice gentleman at the door, when I asked for a table for 2 he let me know that there was a wait as it was quite crowded (crowding bars is how we roll when it rains in TO). He showed me to the bar and I found a comfy little corner to put my stuff down (shopping bag, work bag, coat - am I the worst or what?). I was immediately approached by the bartender and I asked for a cider (gf over here) of course they had Spirit Tree on tap so I jumped at it! I kept to myself for a bit until the host found me and said he had a table literally 10 minutes after I got in :). He brought me to a table for 6 (3 chairs on one side, a bench on the other). There were 2 men sitting across from each other on one end, and the host tried to seat me in the middle. TRIED. The guys on the end said their bags were already sitting on the chair and they wouldn't move it. WHAT?! I've never encountered such unaccommodating people. The host and I were in shock, looking at each other dumbfounded. The guys wouldn't move their laptop bags to the floor so that they could seat an extra 2 people. The host dealt with it well, I probably wouldn't have taken it but we sat on the other end of the table with 2 empty seats between us for the guys' bags, meanwhile all our bags were on the floor, like normal people.

The point of this story is to show how great the staff was. Also, this is why I am not in the service business, I can't deal with people with such a brazen disregard for others.

Not only was the service incroyable, but the food was fantastic!! We were lazy and just ordered the charcuterie board and cheese board. Laziness paid off because it was fab.

Charcuterie: I am not going to be able to re-list all the meats but the beef carpaccio was insane. It was so fresh, soft, and delicious! Neither of us are big pate fans, but it was quite good!!!

Cheese Board: Loved it (it's difficult not to please me when handed a variety of cheeses) especially because it had this incredible aged cheddar, a personal fav. Also, it came with candied peanuts, granola and berries - like a built-in dessert!

Kettle Chips: There's plenty of bread on the boards but we ordered these to have for me (gluten free) in lieu of the bread. We both enjoyed them thoroughly!!

The bar-only service is a bit inconvenient but it's their thing and it works :) 

Will definitely be back, I can't believe it took me this long to get there!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Toronto. Awesome craft beer selection (including Dieu du Ciel from Montreal) and the staff are super helpful with recommendations and samples for you to try. I wish there was more seating room sometimes as it fills up on most nights, but that's just a testament to how good it is."}
{"text":"Will be very sad once this place moves away. Bar Volo was one of the gems of this neighbourhood. There is a huge selection of craft and loca brews. A great selection of ciders. And did I mention their pizzas are tasty too? Finally, the service here is excellent. The friendly barkeeps would answer any questions you have if you can't make up your mind in choosing a drink!"}
{"text":"Who knew that there could be a good bar ON Yonge street?!
I have wanted to try Volo for a long time because I love microbrews and I'm a huge fan of cask.

This place did not disappoint.  I have to admit with ness y. that the negatives ARE there- After I was done with my menu a guy from anoter table asked me if he could have it; upon walking in there was no host but that was fine because I never listen to the \"wait for your server\" sign and will usually walk into a bar and pick the seat I want.  hah.  

But once seated our waiter was attentive beyond belief.  Came by frequently just to chat and be a cool guy.

The beers are affordable.  I nice to come to a place where a pint incl tax and tip isn't equal to or greater than 10$

The wide selection of bottled beers are nice but I'm a biger fan of draught beer.  They have about 15 on tap- with 5ish rotating casks.

My only qualms are that I wish they had a larger selection of darker ales and stouts.  It was a bit of a struggle to find a draught beer that I adored that was on the dark-bitter side.  Definitely not the selection of a place like C'est what- but neither would I expect them to have that kind of selction considering the size of the place.

The general layout is nice and I can imagine some nice summer nights on that patio.  The resto seems to be sectioned off into 4 parts (front, back bar with couch, side, and patio).  And what is great about this place is there isn't a seat in the house that sucks- you know what I mean? When you walk into a bar and there are ovbious favourable seats that you want to get? Yeah, none of that- every spot is kickin.

Clean washrooms downstairs which is a plus

The food: I ordered chicken pizza of some sort.  I was very good but, in general, the food is in line with Yonge st- dt places- overpriced, good, but not a crazy good deal.  I personally would only come back here for the beer.

Lovely bar- definitely gonna be a regular at this place."}
{"text":"Didn't let me down! This place has been heavily reviewed, so I'll be brief.  Great beer selection, good food.  I had a ceasar salad which was well done.  My boyfriend had putanesca which was great!  I didn't even know they served food before I went here.  Ive actually passed it up because I thought they only had meager bar fair.  

And the beer selection is great!  Too many bars in Toronto with large beer selections really only have Belgians, but Volo has a great selection.  I love that they have local Ontario beers on tap, and lagers, stouts, and ales.  Also, they had a Milwaukee (my home town) microbrew available, which I had never seen in Toronto before.  

Will be returning! Potential five stars for me."}
{"text":"If you like trying different beers COME HERE.

I've been here on two separate occasions. Once in the afternoon for bites and a drink and the most recent time on a Friday night.

Now if you're going to come on a Friday night be prepared to wait for a table/be turned away at the door and told to come back in a little bit. The place isn't very big. Perhaps enough table seating for roughly 30 people and some standing room. My friend and I decided to go on a Friday night, we arrived around 8:15. Place was packed to capacity. Were told to come back in a bit. There's not much around Wellesley but we decided to tough it out for 20min or so and then try again. When we did we were allowed in.

They have a huge blackboard on one wall that has 26 beers (listed A-Z for easy recall when ordering at the bar), and smaller blackboards with other liquors and beers in bottles I believe (I was more focused on the 26 beers on tap). My friend and I are new beer lovers so we like asking bartenders for advice. The bartender was friendly and asked questions to determine what he thinks we would like and made a few suggestions. We had to wait probably 30-40min for a table but the place has a good vibe so it passed quick.

When we sat down we ordered right away. Mind you, for first time goers, you order your food at the bar and they give you a number to take back to your table. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my friend got one of their pizzas. My sandwich was okay. Too much bun. I ended up taking off the top half and just eating it like toast. I will say though that the pork itself was really good. Had and almost sweet taste to it which I liked which complimented the cole slaw that came on it as well. The sandwich looks small but it's pretty mighty and with already two beers down the hole I was pretty stuffed after. My friend enjoyed her pizza, I had a few bites and it was good! You could tell it was cooked in a quality pizza oven.

All in all I would definitely come back here to try more of their beers. I would rate the beer selection at a solid 10/10."}
{"text":"Matrix reference:
Picture Neo and Trinity in a white room. When asked what they want, he says \"Beer. Lots of beer.\" They are then brought to the front steps of Volo. 

And here I thought I had been to places with a great beer selection before! I loved my evening here from the overwhelming beer menu to their fantastic food! 

We were warned before ordering our dinner that it would take sometime as the kitchen was pretty busy, but the wait between our drinks arriving and the waitress coming back to get our food order seemed longer than the actual food prep time. It didn't really matter as we were not in a particular rush, (if we were, this might have been a 4 star review). But you could spend ages going through the beer menu (and the chalk board) with what you would like to sample, from $8 - $9 650ml bottles to $40 and over! I would never order a bottle for the price of over $15 or $20, but the higher prices does make me curious! 

It was a shame that a lot of their bottles were out of stock so I went with the waiter's recommendation of \"Tipperary\" a pale ale full of flavour! 
I recommend letting the staff know what type of beer you do enjoy and they will definitely recommend something that's right up your alley. 

Everything in the short menu seems simple, but you just get a feeling that they would make it so everything clicks and you end up with a tassty Italian dish! I got the \"volo burger\" and for $16 it was very nicely done, not an overdose of food like you would get at more mainstream joints. We ordered a cheese plate as well and I definitely recommend it for a great sharing start! I almost forgot the dessert too! No matter what, you should seriously consider indulging!!!! 

I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance and their wooden tables chairs and benches, surprisingly comfy! The staff were very friendly despite being busy and that always warrants extra star points from me! Volo is in such a great location as well that I will definitely be taking people there more often!

Note - they do not accept Mastercard, and I hear the female washroom has one stall without a door...or something like that."}
{"text":"great place. the food was great. The wine list could be better. Their kobe type burger was phenominal. Great location on Yonge and St Joseph. I liked their terrace too!"}
{"text":"Bestill my beer drinking heart - this place is amazing!  Everything about this place rocks.  If you do not know anything about Canadian place, this is a solid place to learn and discover something new.  I now fully respect Canadian beer.  The patio is awesome and I like their orderly system for ordering beers.  There are not waitresses or bar (in the traditional sense).  You wait in line at the counter and order there.  It works so well.  I would have been happy to have stayed here all night to discover Canada through beer.  They even had free wi-fi.  Winner winner, chicken dinner."}
{"text":"Came here on a date and the Yelp reviews do not lie.. This bar is pretty snazzy. It's funny how I've never noticed it before. I had heard of it, but despite walking by so frequently, never realized it was there!
So I'm not much of a beer drinker, my taste buds prefer the lighter/more mild brews, causing me to feel overwhelmed by the selection available.
It's a good thing there's some knowledgable bartenders, and patrons! A customer suggested a beer for me, which was actually the perfect selection.
The ladies washroom was out of order, so everyone was using the men's washroom. By the time we were ready to leave, it got quite messy in there.. Yuck haha.
The one thing I will mention is that it's a pretty small space and as popular as this bar is, it fills up fast. We went on a Sunday evening, and it wasn't packed, but busy. The warmer weather will mean more space with the open patio, but I'll wager it will be more full then too.
I can't comment on the food as we didn't order anything. But I'll be returning, so I'll update on that later. All in all, worth the hype."}
{"text":"I don't like disliking places in my neighbourhood- its like having an awful rivalry with a roommate or hating your moms recently moved in boyfriend who insists on redecorating everything in mauve and smells like Old Spice. 
This is how I feel in regards to Bar Volo.
I went when it was raining slightly. There were no seats inside, all outside discluded from the awning were soaked and none available under the umbrella so I requested that a table be wiped so we had a place to sit. I was handed a pile of disposable napkins. I get its self serve but I didn't know that bussing my own table was in the deal. 
Cheese plate - $20 from what I recall and pretty disappointing. The menu doesnt state which cheese's it includes, you get a random selection of three. Suspense and food in my opinion dont exactly pair well, but a little mystery never hurt anyone. The cheese was brought by a food runner, and left without an explanation of which was which. ok... 
The cheese was also served very cold. If two sections of the menu are dedicated to cheese one would expect they be served at room temperature. 
The preserve served with the cheese was uneatable. It was quite bitter and tasted like fruit rind, so I requested honey. No honey, so I order the Fig and mustard preserve with the advisory that it is rather sweet. Same bitter rind taste. I was aghast at how something as sweet and simple as figs and mustard could go so horribly wrong.  
I think its great that Volo uses Woodlots bread, but the bread I got with the cheese plate was stale to the point of the breads body being sharp texture wise. 

For the area if I wanted a cheese plate or cured meats go up to Terroni in Summerhill for cheaper cheese, a description of what you're eating, complementing preserves, jams etc, or even Sassafraz which has  similarly priced local cheese plate options. 
Cool you have province based beers and ciders, but being among of the obsolete, but growing restaurant population to serve these doesn't justify the insane 100 - 150% markup on some of the beverage options which can be found for cheaper elsewhere in the city and who have more FOH staff to employ.
All the breweries are within driving distance, and aren't being flown over on their own airplane seat and can be bought on site of the brewery for 40 - 75% cheaper."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit to Bar Volo. Extremely friendly and helpful staff guide you through their extensive and ever-changing beer menu. Lots of brand new seasonals and casks to try, with a great selection of food to pair. We had a few drinks, supported by their small charcuterie board--which certainly didn't end up being small. Great value here with an outstanding variety of unique jams, meats, cheese, and crustinis.  Unpretentious and inviting, Bar Volo is a great spot to try some new beers."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gone seriously downhill since its days as the romantic and charming \"Caffe Volo\".

Arrived Wednesday for afterwork drinks with a lady I've not seen in years. We were having a real heart-to-heart over wine. She bought the first bottle, and when it came to buy mine, I was astonished...$75 plus tax for a bottle??! For an Ontario wine. Are you kidding me? I asked her if she was kidding. Sadly she was not.

Seeing as it was my turn to get a bottle, I agreed to buy the cheapest (sorry, but not made of money here). Not only are the prices high, they did not have table service here. They had all of two bartenders working. I got attitude at the bar, to boot. \"I'd like to order your most economical bottle of wine,\" I said. He looked at me blankly, as if I was supposed to go thru the whole menu and find it myself. I ended up having to, the bartender was of no help. Sorry, $3 tip on a $50 bottle guys, with that kind of service.

Then to top it all off, as my and my friend were already into the second bottle, one of the staff interrupted us and said we would have to SHARE our small table with two other people because the bar was too crowded. Excuse me? We're not talking LONG tables here, this is a really intimate environment. After that kind of money for that kind of service, there was no way I was agreeing to that. Luckily, we were able to get ahold of a third friend who was coming to join us, and we firmly denied the staff member's request."}
{"text":"I'm sad. I chose this restaurant tonight because they *had* the best Pasta Carbonara I've ever had, and I was meaning to come back and try it again. I finally got the opportunity, and THEY CHANGED THE MENU

It's not the one you see online anymore, instead it's one side of appetizers and share plates, and other side of overpriced sandwiches and burgers ($16-20). Well, without much choice, we got the charcuterie plate ($16) and I got a Bison Burger ($16). 

The Charcuterie was okay, I wouldn't order this though. The meats were sparse and it was served with this hard hot pepper pretzel that didn't taste very good. It also came with olives and some special mustard, which was a waste as both my friend and I don't know either. 
Try for something else more unique on the menu. 

My bison burger was thick and juicy, and came with coleslaw. I would havemuch rather have had the pasta - we would have gone somewhere else!

The drinks are extensive, and if i wasn't driving, I would certainly come here again for drinks. But the food is nothing to call home about. I wish I knew, I would have gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"This bar had a great selection of excellent Ontario beer on tap. They use an alphabet system, so you just say the letter that matches the beer you want. Cash or Visa card only. I also tried the pulled pork, which was okay. The chips were too salty. Enjoy the beer and relaxed atmosphere of this place."}
{"text":"Wow. This was a cool place until we went to pay. Cash and visa only. And frankly, this wouldn't have been a big deal except for Tom our server. He became quite belligerent and wanted to educate me and my guests on the costs of other forms of payment for small businesses. In fact he became defensive right out the gate and then escalated this saying he doesn't care about upsetting patrons as there is an endless list of 19 year olds with cash. Sad how a waiter can destroy an otherwise wonderful evening when all he had to do was apologize for any inconvenience and direct us to an ATM."}
{"text":"Nice patio, good craft beer but go somewhere else if you are hungry... Small hamburger, a bit over priced"}
{"text":"Volo's beer selection and knowledge just keeps getting better! They're currently into sour beers, which are not easy to find. They now feature several of their own brews and are working with some other craft breweries on specialties and one-off creations. This is more than a pub; they are helping improve the local craft brewing industry. I'm looking forward to Cask Days!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant a few days ago, though I have been before. This restaurant is one of the top three places in Toronto to go, if not the top place in Toronto to go if you like beer. The serving staff is extremely knowledgeable about beer, they know big things like the difference between a larger and a pale ale, but they also know big things like A. Strong Ales. 

Furthermore as a member of BA, I was very impressed by the selection of beers. This selection is only going to get better as I have been told because they are going to be the only bar in Canada to serve Stone beers. For those who don't know, this is a major coupe in terms of beer. Stone is an excellent brewery which is fairly hard to get outside of the US, some of the beers you can't even get outside of California. 

The waiter we had was really excellent and went and managed to get us a cheese platter even though the kitchen was closed, which was really really appreciated after the third or fourth beer we had there. The ambiance was excellent as always. If you are a BA or RB'r (if you are, you know what I am talking about) , this is one of the places to check out, along with C'est What, and Mike Duggans new place on Victoria. Even you aren't any of the above, and would like to learn more about beer, this is a great place to go, and the serving staff takes the time to educate people who have a real interest in learning. 

All around it's a great place to go for beers regardless of your knowledge level."}
{"text":"Volo is one of the best beer-centric bars in the city. They do things that set them apart from the competition. 

This place is not only a craft beer mecca but also doubles as a brewpub. The folks at Volo brew their own beer under the monicker \"house ales.\" In addition to their own concoctions, they also have a large selection of draft beer (over 30 taps). What I like about their selection is that it is almost exclusively Canadian beers with the vast majority of beers on tap being from Ontario, it's always great when bars support local brewers. 

Despite much of their draft beer being local I did see some beers that I had not seen before. Volo tends to carry many one-offs from local brewers and on the occassion that I went even had some collablratove beers from local breweries. In addition to the extensive taps list they do have a pretty exotic selection of bottles, however these are a little too pricey for my liking so I tend to steer clear of them. 

The owners of Volo are also the brains behind the annual cask days festival, they have a yearly IPA challenge and often have special events such as tap takeovers. They certainly get bonus points for being one of the champions of craft beer in Toronto. 

The place itself is pretty intimate, and has a spacious streetside patio. There is no waiter service so one has to go to the bar to get drinks. The place is usually buzzing but the service doesn't seem to suffer, the bartenders are always willing to make suggestions and certainly know their products very well. They have a small uninspired food menu which is ok if you want a snack but you come here to drink not eat. 

They are located within walking distance of Wellesley station, very easy to get to by TTC. Overall this is a Toronto gem, and one of the top 3 places for craft beer in the city."}
{"text":"I love coming to bar volo. The beer selection is one of the best in Toronto. I am so so sad that they are closing."}
{"text":"A little bit the wrong direction to make me a regular,  but always up for an excuse to pop in and sample.  Does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Solid place tucked amongst the filth that is Yonge street. There is a cozy little patio that is nice, but we sat inside away from the street fumes. The interior is cozy in that woody way with chalkboard menus... About those chalkboard menus, there were so many beers written up there, that I just glanced at it and had to look away because my head hurt. 

Anyway, they have food that is very pickle-centric. If you like pickles, you'll love the big fat ones on a stick and pickled this and that. We shared the Baller plate that was a bunch of meats and cheeses, as well as a few odds and ends like a deep fried dumpling, and a salty piece of smoked fish. I am not that into cheeses and high sodium meals, so I would not order it again. There is nothing on the menu that is healthy, FYI. So if you are a picky healthy eater, eat at home before you come.

In terms of the drinks, there are many beers. I'm on a diet so I didn't have anything alcoholic.

Actually, my whole review is heavily influenced by the fact that I am watching my intake and trying to achieve a better body. So if you don't care about that kind of thing, come here and have a good time. Let loose, have some beer, and eat a pickle."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good beer, nice environment for a Friday night to someone new in town. It was a bit chilly in the place, and I just can't seem to get over the wood boards they serve everything on. Crumbs EVERYWHERE!"}
{"text":"I was with 2 coworkers in Toronto and one of them who used to live in the city recommended we stop in this place for a beer, because they have a great selection. He wasn't lying, because they have a display of all the beer bottles when you walk in & tons of good beer on tap. I could smell delicious Italian food as soon as we walked in and everything looked great, but we had already eaten so I can't review the food. However, to our surprise we happened to walk in on Cask Days '09, a Cask Ale festival going on that week. The waitress told us we could either sit down and she would get us Cask Ales from outside or we could drink out on the patio. We made our way outside and they had about a dozen different Cask Ales from all over Canada and some European ones. 

It was my first experience with cask ales but I really liked them. You can taste the beer more without all the carbonation and generally they are darker and more flavorful than most beers. I tried 3 pints of different types, and each were around $8 CAD on average, but well worth it. 

We met the owner outside, Ralph, he served us some of our ales, and the other bartenders/servers were nice. Ralph told us about how he goes about getting casks of ale from all over for these types of events and how he gets a lot of unique beers in general from local Canadian brewers and whatnot. He was real cool. I would love to come back here for a couple of beers on my next visit to Toronto"}
{"text":"Incredible variety in beer selection.  Enough said.  Seating a little limited, especially because the lineups at the bar become so long and bleed into the seating sections."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's bday, a party of 5. 

Tip:If you don't come early then it'll be hard to find a table to accommodate larger groups. 

Ambiance: cool, hipster bar aka it's lighten by candle light so you can't see anything without your phone. This bar is pretty lit with the tight crowds and loud music. 

Ordering process: watch your step since there's a small platform to go up before make your way through the crowded lounge area. It'll take some pushing shoving but eventually you'll make your way to the bar and order your tipple. They have an extensive drink menu That's handwritten on a huge blackboard by the entrance but God knows I couldn't see for my life. They also have a condensed drink menu at the bar but you know you'll be missing out on beer brands that you've never even knew you wanted to try. 

So once you've ordered they will give you a number that you can bring back to your table and they'll bring the food and drinks to you. 

Menu: lots of beers, beer cocktails, wine and cocktails to try. But do look at the price- my friend ordered a beer without checking the price and the bill was $35 for a big beer bottle that I've never even heard of but that definitely caught our attention lol!!
Their meat and cheeseboards were good too! But I would recommend yelpers to eat before going as there's not much variety for food and it's more for snacking. 

And did I mention, hipster restaurants are usually $$$

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Came here late at night for a drink and a bite to eat.

LARGE selection of beers. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but the staff is friendly and offers great suggestions based on your preferences. I got a watermelon beer that was perfect for the summer night. They have homemade kettle chips and in-house pickles that were delicious. I also got a rueben that wasn't a traditional reuben sandwich. It was bite-sized and open-faced. Nevertheles, it was really yummy."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night with my buddies.  This tiny place is pretty hip and has a nice intimate ambiance complete with candle light.  Perfect place to take a date or chill with friends.

When we arrived, there weren't any tables available, and so the host told us that we could go up to the bar and order food and drinks there and just chill until a table opened up.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table to open and then we were promptly seated.

The ordering system is unique here - you order food/drinks at the bar, pay, and then you get a flag with a number, which you place on your table, so that they can find you and give you your food.

I ordered a Beaus x Le Trou Du Diable...(Mango Saison) and a Pulled Pork Sandwich with Caesar Salad.  Tbh, I picked that beer because it was \"A\" and light - I'm no beer connoisseur, but it tasted pretty good.  The Pulled Pork Sandwich was good as well - they melt cheese into it (Y) - but the bread was a bit tough.  The Caesar Salad was okay - it was actually just kale with cheese and light caesar dressing.

This place was legit cool and unique.  They have a buttload of options with regards to beer - 26 letters of the alphabet + 6 numbers, and in terms of food - bar snacks, charcuterie boards, etc.  Definitely deserves a repeat visit with their expansive menu."}
{"text":"Casks!  Ever since discovering these in England10 years ago, I've become a fanatic.  So, when I walked in here and they had a nice selection of these on top of craft and house taps, I was impressed.  Small intimate place but tons of character and very friendly, knowledgeable barkeeps."}
{"text":"This place is like Biermarkt for those who know.

If you're drinking with amateurs that only know the main brands like Stella, Heineken, Budweiser, etc then this is not the place to go. However, if you are with a adventurous group who likes new beers to try, then you should definitely give this a shot. They usually have around 26 independent or craft brews on tap plus a handful of cask beers as well. I was particularly impressed with their house double india pale ale, cleverly titled \"Big Hoppa\". Really delicious and with 9.3% alcohol, packs quite a punch.

The food menu seems smaller than when I first came here, with most of the focus being on charcuterie and plates for sharing. Pulled pork sandwich was tasty though.

The only real downside is that it can take a while to get a table, and the only form of payment is cash or visa. Should you be willing to overlook those flaws, this place is a must visit for beer drinkers!"}
{"text":"I'd probably elevate this place to 5 stars if I drank beer. However, even as a non-beer drinker, I still enjoy going to Volo. They *do* offer some great wines and cider, so there's still something I can partake in. Volo's a great place to go with a friend or two (not really more than that, because  the tables are small and the place can get crowded), and catch up while grabbing a drink and splitting a charcuterie and/or cheese plate (the rest of the food can be a hit or miss). It gets a little bit noisy in there when it gets crowded, but when the weather's warm, Volo's patio is a great place to be."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to check out Bar Volo for a few years, but the timing never worked out. Finally, on this trip, we had the good fortune of visiting this place.

The good:
1) 30+ beers on tap with some of their own brews, including casks. SCORE!
2) Charcuterie plate and other food looked really good although we didn't try. We did look at the menu though, and the selection seemed perfect for the intended atmosphere.
3) Cash and Visa. Seems that they finally got their act together and accept Visa in addition to cash
4) Small place but has little nooks and crannies and benches to have quiet conversation.
5) Great rustic farmhouse decor, including chalkboards.

The bad: 
1) Staff are a bit off-putting
2) No bar seating!! I love sitting at the bar. This is disappointing.
3) The main dining area has awkward seating.
4) It's all self-serve, even the food. 

It's not a hipster place, the crowd didn't seem uppity, and the beer selection was wonderful. We tried some interesting brews that were endemic to Ontario - ones with which I was previously unfamiliar. I'd like to come back during the daytime for some tasting. Daytime drinking is the best!"}
{"text":"Massive selection of beers on tap. Good food and pleasant staff.   Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"What's up with the service?  I'm pretty sure our table should have given me the tip (and I did a seriously bang up job... We're talking 18% at least, and one of the girls at the table should have written her number on the receipt and said \"CALL ME :)\". The food was good, we got the Baller board which was awesome for a group of 6, and two pizzas which were tasty and filling. The beer selection is ginormous and the outdoor patio was fun, outdoors, and outdoors. But between this order at the bar thing, walking your own drinks over to the table (when you're texting friends, \"HELP ASAP\" from the bar while people are giving you cut eye behind you in line, you just want to nope the hell out).  I think I got my own water bottles from the bar at least three times, took our tables orders, and paying involved me grabbing everyone's cards while they huddled behind me at the bar to settle a bill for 6.  I saw no more than a few waitresses, maybe seriously short staffed for the July 4 long weekend. The restaurant is located in an awesome corner on Yonge and it's fun as hell. But service. Yeah.  Not thinking future dinner plans there next time for a big group."}
{"text":"Stepping in from the overload of Yonge street, Volo has a great cozy feel, the dimly lit, crisply written chalkboard menu, with cool, lights and a variety of seating and a raised area near the bar.  

It isn't suited well to peak periods where you're practically sitting on other guests and if later in the night where there's no table service you finding your way back to the bar is not particularly easy.  The patio is great which is surprising to me because I never thought I'd want to be on the tourist/crazy people highway of this street.  

I'm not a beer drinker either, but Volo does have some great bourbons.  However, the 
bartender is either an expert sometimes or someone who I think they just picked up off the street.  I had to point out every bottle one night and then it took them forever to pour a glass of water, blaming the tap.

Still gets 4 stars b/c I didn't have to take the streetcar to Queen West or Ossington to find a place like this."}
{"text":"BarVolo is one of the best bars in Toronto. From the choice of beers on tap and in bottles to the tapas style bistro food, your definitely going to enjoy this Yonge and Wellesley staple. Expect to wait for a table, but once you get seated inside at the tables to share with other guest, you'll love the vibe. With the A to Z beers on tap that are changed on a regular basis, you'll find something different that you won't find anywhere else. They carry several beers from the Shawinigan QC based Trou Du Diable which are always a hit in my books. You will also find various strong Belgian style beers that will give you the buzz that will only make you like this place even more. If you are looking for a bite with your beers, make sure to try the sandwiches or the charcuterie boards."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite bar in Toronto. Great atmosphere, and most importantly, an outstanding selection of beers from all over the world!

It gets busy on weekends, but during the summer time they're opening their patio, for outdoor service. 

Highly recommend Bar Volo!"}
{"text":"This place has an excellent drink menu and the atmosphere is great.  It's moving though and I look forward to the new location even more than the current."}
{"text":"Fantastic assortment of beer, but some marks are lost for a lack of Unibroue beers; regardless there are plenty of beers to keep me happy. Small food menu with some great options, however on the pricey side for what you get. Service is rather good, but after its gets busy harder to get your server's attention. Overall a great place to try different and unique beers in Toronto."}
{"text":"There's a reason why Bar Volo's still around today and I found that out recently!

The servers here are extremely knowledgeable about all things beer - I got a great recommendation (Chill Winston) which paired nicely with the charcuterie board. Super cozy ambiance - loved the exposed brick decor, the chalk board menus, and non-distracting music level. What a gem in this neighbourhood! Totally would frequent again.

Note: $10 minimum spend if ya wanna use yo credit card."}
{"text":"So many craft beer choices, FROM TAP! My go-to when I'm in the neighbourhood / perfect patio day. It is very loud and a crowded small place but has so much charm. It is unfortunate that it is closing in a couple of months."}
{"text":"I really like Volo. First reason is definitely the beer. They have the best selection of cask beers I have seen. There is always a new beer to try, and the staff always makes good recommendations based on what I like, so everything I try is good! I have been once for the Cask Days event and really enjoyed trying the different beers, talking to the staff about their origins, and the welcoming spirit. It almost felt like an outdoor festival in the small cozy space.

Second reason is the cozy atmosphere. In the winter, this is a nice warm spot to while away the hours, and in the summer, the patio is relaxed and comfortable.

Last but not least is the food. I have tried the pizzas, cheese plates and the cheese and meat plates. All were well presented, fresh and good accompaniments for the beer. 

Bar Volo is a unique little gem in Toronto. Now that the warm weather is coming/here, let's go have drinks on the patio!"}
{"text":"Very warm, welcoming atmosphere, attention to detail and nice lighting. Long communal wooden tables, nice menu, and great appetizers.  A nice place to come with a group of friends and share appetizers.  I'm not a beer fan, but for the atmosphere and the food I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Great beer bar. Lot's of unique beer on tap, 5 or 6 cask beer and a nice atmosphere make this a worthy stop.  This is great if you are staying in the area or even worth a taxi ride if you aren't!"}
{"text":"PART 3!!!!!!!
So after venturing to LIberty Village we made a safe decision to start making our way NORTH.....along Yonge St......BarVolo was the third venue of choice, and it made sense! after all is relatively new and its already got its share of reviews :) 

Just north of Wellesley, BarVolo is another hipster place with both spacious indoor and outdoor seating available.  However note to self! when we arrived the waiter advised us that they do \"communal first come-first serve seating\" so if you've got a large table, but small party, be certain there are chances you may be sharing tables with another small party of folks.  Also if you do happen to leave your seats unattended you'd have to leave your hat, or jacket there to ensure no one would take your seats........  Its a great idea, but can sometimes be a HIT or MISS depending on who you're sharing tables with lol.

Another drawback! you have to go up to the bar, to order and pay for your drink.... which I thought was a bit foolish! What's the point of having a wait staff?  This could be a potential detterance for those who just want to relax for drinks without having to wait in line worrying if someone took your seat, etc.  Overall the bar area got congested as time went one with people lining up for their drinks......but again it was prime time! so its something to expect. 

For beer lovers, BarVolo has an extensive list of beers all written up on its board. At times It can get confusing especially when you're contemplating on which beer to try listed from A-Z.  Their food looked awesome! and they have a small booth where the house dj spins some old skool tracks throughout the evening/night.....

AGAIN this place needs a second visit to determine if its worth visting a third time.
Part 3 FIN!................part 4 its north to Yonge and Eglinton!"}
{"text":"A great beer list (snacks) and breezy patio. Ordering at the bar is a bit tiresome, but otherwise a great spot to hit after work!"}
{"text":"In Esperanto, \"volo\" apparently means \"what one wishes or desires.\" This translation seems to be completely congruent with the beer selection of this bar, as there is literally hundreds of brews from which to choose. While I have to admit that barVolo arguably has the best selection of craft beers in the city (including yummy Dieu du Ciel), I can't quite decide if it's worth the price. 

The bar itself has a wonderful aesthetic, but it's gastropub ambiance literally gets lost in the noise of its post-work (4à7) crowd. When you're ready to go for a second round of drinks, you'll probably have to go and line up at the bar amongst many other people. If you look on the bright side of things, the queue is a blessing in disguise in that you can actually look through the entire menu of beers on the chalkboard and order accordingly. 

Even though barVolo rejects the idea of having conventional servers in its establishment (ie. you cannot order at your table), the bartenders tacitly absorb this service-centric role and maintain an extremely knowledgeable and kind demeanor. They are also keen on matching your tastebuds with the perfect beer if it's not too packed.

Logistically, I'd recommend going to barVolo pretty late (after 12am) to ensure you can get seats and drinks in a pretty quick manner. I'd also entirely avoid the food menu, as that is not their core competence."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

Looking for a place to chill for a bit before dinner we headed here after our room escape adventures at the Riddle Room which is next door.  At around 5:30pmish this place was already packed and we got the last table.

You order at the bar - no table service.  The menu is on the chalkboard on the wall - there are lots of interesting choices here for drinks/food, but depending on where you are sitting you might not be able to see it all unfortunately.  It's a long narrow place which I guess would be ok if there was table service but since you have to order everything at the bar I can see how it could get annoying when it's a full house.  

I'm glad I had the chance to check it out but I doubt I would come back specifically for this place.  I just don't want to be pushing my way to the bar to order anything."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a lot lately.... love craft beer, lots of variety, and endless choices to satisfy your beer tastebuds....

As long as you have a love for beer, you can't go wrong. With a giant chalkboard listing approx 30 kinds of beers that rotate on a regular basis, you're sure to find something you'll like... let me warn you however, don't expect a beer to be around the second time you go in... most likely - it will be rotated into something else.

I have to say... the beers are a bit pricey, especially if it comes in a 12 oz glass.... but they do have $5 deals on Mondays on selected beers so it is something that should be taken advantage of.
 
There is also an assortment of bottled beer in their fridges but those can get super pricey too.

As for food, there are meats and cheeses and light eats... last time I was there, I ordered the chacuterie plate, which came with an assortment of pate. ham, sausage and spreads... I was surprised that they even gave us thinly sliced fat!!!! I was shocked it didn't taste like \"fat\" and was a good item to have with the other condiments. 

The place can get packed and the tables are shared, but as long as you don't mind getting a little cozy, this is a great social spot."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is, but i really don't like barVolo. It's lovely on the outside, it's a great location, the beer selection is phenomenal but a) it's expensive and b) it's FULL of business clad 7pm beverage seeking young professionals. it gets ridiculously busy any time after 5:30 so you end up waiting half an hour to be able to share a table with some randoms. 

Food - pretty creative, also pretty delicious but small portions and again - $$$$.

I wouldn't come here out of my own will unless there was a space on the patio and it was a nice quiet Sunday afternoon!."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on a whim late at 1 am on a Tuesday night. I've heard of so many great things about this place, but as someone who's not much of a bar-guy, I never really made the opportunity to go. I'm glad I finally got to try this place, and it'll definitely be one of my go-to bars from now on.

It was quite crowded when I went in, but it wasn't crowded like a dive bar. Everyone was still seated, and the tables aren't uncomfortably close to each other. During their late-night service, you order your food and bar at the front (not sure if that's what you have to do for dinner), and I was surprised that despite the large number of people, we were still able to catch the bartender fairly quickly.

They have a massive selection of drinks - which is great - but it might be to the point where you can feel quite overwhelmed if you're not much of a drinker. Feel free to ask the bartender for recommendations, they all seemed quite friendly and willing to help.

The ambience of the bar was nice. It didn't feel pretentious at all, but it didn't seem grungy either. It was right in the middle where you could walk in with T-shirt and jeans, or a full on suit, and still fit in to the overall vibe. There wasn't much mingling happening though, so I'm not sure how conducive the place is to meet people, if that's what you're looking for.

The charcuteries were great. I wish I were able to take better pictures but there was a generous portion of food. They were also happy to give us extra bread, and served it to us freshly toasted.

I hope I'll have a chance to go back soon to try their dinner menu. Given that I was impressed by their late-night service, I'm sure I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here over a week ago most curious about the cask ales and to enjoy a date with someone I was very keen on. Since I am not familiar with beer, I asked the bartender for a recommendation on a cask ale. He read my mind and recommended a rather great tasting ale! My companion had a much decisive mind about the beer, and in the end, it's a beer bar, so no disappointment was registered on his face.

Since I had never been here before and I arrived earlier than him, I was able to observe the bar and staff and patrons. The servers are very friendly and helpful. It's a very cozy bar. There are approximately 8 tables inside - all resembling communal tables, yet, I strongly suspected the people sitting actually came together as a party. In the bar area, which is slightly raised, there is a disgustingly old coach, a small table, and a bar railing with 2 stools.  I was fortunate enough to grab the stools.

The place is fantastic for intimate conversation, furtive glances, seductive smiles and flirting. What can be more propitious for a potential romantic relationship? Ah yes, discovering your date possesses a black hole where the heart should be and a tongue designed for manipulation, leaving you feeling very badly about yourself. The joy of dating includes discovering not just people but also places. I am most certain I will return here, just as I am certain I never want to see him again."}
{"text":"This was on a list of craft beer destinations I researched before traveling here.  Yes, it can be a bit dark in there, but it wasn't too dark to see what you are eating and drinking.  Most of the seating is set up for communal seating, so you may end up sharing a table.

I am sooOOOooo glad we made it here.  They have a nice nano-scale brewery in house (look for \"house ale\" on the tap list).  The beer list is a great selection.  I admit I never made it to the bottles because they had 26 taps and 6 casks for you to build your own flights/tasters of.  The wait staff was attentive and very helpful.  The bartender was quick and knowledgeable.  I don't know why other bars don't write the tap number on your taster like they did, because I didn't have to worry about mixing up my tasters.  Great for those dipping a toe into craft beer or beer geeks.

Now we didn't have a lot of food as we had just come from dinner, but their bread pudding made with sourdough was ridiculously great.  It was apparently a way to cope with a bread order gone wrong, but it was phenomenal and really deserves to have a permanent home on the menu."}
{"text":"Good for beer but not for food.  They have a phenomenal selection of beer. Really can't complain about that.  The food on the other hand is over priced and nothing special.  On two different visits I've had the cheese plate, the burger, and the selection of dips. The quality of the food is mediocre at best.  The portion sizes are quite small.  The quality of the service is also nothing special.  The staff is fairly knowledgable but  lack enthusiasm.  The real kicker for me was the state of the bathroom.  The ladies bathroom was dank, dark and creepy.  It could use a thorough cleaning, a brighter light and an exorcism.  I recommend you take both a young and old priest with you if you dare to venture to the ladies bathroom."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times.

Decent food, big selection of beers. But while there's a big selection, it seems the number of different breweries is much less diverse. That said, it's not always easy to find a beer that (a) fits your style while (b) fitting your price range.

I dislike the setup, though. It's like a gastropub but with no servers, so I guess it's a bar. But at the same time it's not really a bar because it's mostly all sit down tables. So you're probably having conversations with your friends. Then having to go up and stand in line at the bar kind of ruins the experience for me. Not sure why a place with fairly expensive food can't afford servers. I've had good experience with the bartenders, though. They're friendly and attentive.

They have a min $10 policy for using cards which I'm not a fan of. What is this, a convenience store?  My friend asked me to put my next beer on her tab so she can use her card. They're already selling beer at almost quadruple its retail price, why do they add this inconvenience for their customers who only want one strong beer for the night?

I'm also not a fan of the centralized beer menu. If you're unlucky enough to have a seat that faces away from the giant chalkboard, then be prepared to stretch your neck. I've been to several gastropubs with big rotating beer menus before, and neither of them aren't so cheap they don't want to make new menus every time. Having menus is nice, cause then you have room to add little blurbs about all the beers like where it's from and its style.

And I'm not sure what's up with people bringing their newborns to this place."}
{"text":"Yonge is a good place to go if you want porn, stripper clothing, so-so Korean food, or bondage gear, but not so much if you are looking for a good bar. Volo is one of the newer places in the area that is trying to fix that. It's a very nice bar, one that seems completely out of place in the area. It strikes me as a more modest Beer Bistro. It has an excellent selection of beers, and seems to always have an interesting mix of things on tap. I rarely recognize anything on their drafts menu. Prices are reasonable. The place has a very casual vibe. They have a fairly large patio. Unfortunately, since it is right on Yonge, you often have to deal with construction, police cars, and other noise. (I guess there isn't much they can do about that.) To balance things out, Yonge is a fun street to people watch on. Unlike Beer Bistro, the food isn't that spectacular. They have a small menu, and so far every time I've gone they have run out of pizza. Seriously. I usually go for drinks, and not food, and in that regard you really can't lose here. If I could give this place 3.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Cool, laid-back vibe.  

Great bear - fantastic selection.  Food was delicious!

The service was nothing to write home about, but with good food, good drinks, good atmosphere, this can mostly be ignored.

The only think is - I wish there was more seating!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection. Loved the create-your-own-board concept...we ordered a variety of meats, cheese, pates and fun accoutrements like assorted pickled veg, condiments (eg rhubarb relish), olives, kettle chips. Now that's a plate of deliciousness right there! Loved it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a phenomenal selection of beers - sadly I understand it's moving soon to make way for condos, or something. Don't know the details though.

I only drank and didn't eat, so can't comment on the food - but the selection of beers and of whiskeys is excellent."}
{"text":"It sounds like most people go here for the beer, but as a non-beer drinker, I can only report on the wine. I thought going into this place as well that it was more of a wine bar. However, now I know it's got a good selection of both.

I really enjoyed by gamay (on the recommended list), however, I was a little put off by the prices of the recommended wines. Expect to pay between $11-$15 per glass, albeit a good one. Maybe I'm just used to paying European prices for wine, but it did seem on the expensive side.

Also, the location is a bit out of the way as well, and I'm not sure if I'd go back soon, living in the heart of the entertainment district myself."}
{"text":"Yep - found my spot in Toronto. I decided to explore and started wandering down the street from my hotel. I passed some interesting places (read: adult stores). Just went I thought I was going to turn back, I stumbled onto Bar Volo.

They have a huge selection. You can order by the letter - they have each beer listed on a large chalk board associated with the tap they are under. You order at the bar. 

They have some bar foods as well. I didn't partake but it looked good."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Toronto on our honeymoon, and I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that we spent a good five to six hours here enjoying the outdoor patio, beer, and food at barVolo.  If we had more time, I am sure we would have spent many more hours here!

barVolo has a fantastic selection of thirty or so craft beers featuring primarily local Ontario microbrews.  The bottle list features an excellent list of imports including some that are rarely found in Ontario.  They don't have wait staff so if you want to order anything, you have to order from the bar.  We didn't mind this.  If anything, it made the bar seem a tad more intimate.  And, it is when I was waiting in line to order that I found out that the owner of barVolo is a beer enthusiast and is training to become a sommelier.  No wonder why the beer and wine lists are so excellent!

I have a gluten allergy so unlike my husband who loves craft beers, I tend to judge places by their food.  We originally came to barVolo for lunch, and I absolutely loved their menu!  The food menu features to quality meat and cheese boards in addition to a number of Italian dishes like pastas, pizzas, and sandwiches.  I love meat and cheese boards, so my husband decided to create our own board composed of pickled fruits and vegetables, cheeses, pate, mustards and other condiments like bacon jam, bread, and potato chips.  It was possibly one of the best lunches I've ever had.

If you love craft beer like my husband, you must go to barVolo.  And, if meat and cheese boards are your thing, you will love the selection at barVolo!"}
{"text":"Bar Volo, not sure what to make of you.  You have so many delicious beers, but your service is so hit and miss, and your prices can be so irrational.  

Bar Volo gets credit for helping bring the craft beer scene to Toronto.  They do a great job bringing in amazing beers.  Their selection is truly outstanding. The have a nice mix of mostly Ontario and Quebecois craft beers, both on tap and in bottle.  Somewhere in the neighborhood of 25-30 taps, plus some additional beers on cask.

The seating inside is generally communal and often in short supply.  The patio has a nice supply of seating, but it could really use some heat lamps.  The ambience is generally nice, but the music is often played too loudly with low quality speakers, so it's just an overly loud, muddled background sound.

The staff is also shockingly hit and miss.  A few of them are great, but some of them are just super rude.  They never, ever offer any tastes when you're curious about something.  They generally are fairly knowledgeable, although a bit slammed.

They thing I don't understand is their slightly predatory pricing.  For example, they had a La Trou du Diable tasting, but the tastes were served at $10-$11 per 150-200 ml taste.  Just insanely crazy pricing.  They also have a \"happy hour\" on Monday in which all beers are $5, unless they have an asterisk.  Well, all but 3 or 4 of their 30 some beers seem to have an asterisk.  Kind of not cool"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best bars in the city. Delicious beers and an awesome atmosphere, offer a unique setting in Toronto's beer scene. Grab a table early though...it get's jam packed. 

As for the service.....yeah, there's a couple of duds working there who need to get off their beer connoisseur high horse. But as for the guys (typically) behind the bar, who are part of the family business, they're absolute gems and always provide excellent service.

Also a great place to take a date!"}
{"text":"alright. so, volo. 

food and drink= yum. great beer selection, obvs. i've only had the vegetali sandwich, but it was very flavourful with enough veggies packed in it to keep me full and the potatoes are roasted with some rosemary. 

but service? every server i've had here has been rude and being treated like an idiot for not magically knowing what random beers they happen to have is a bit of a negative for me.
 
the first time i came it took about 15 minutes for my table to receive their beers, and it was not busy at all. the server brought one of us the wrong drink and said 'well one of you can drink it, or i guess i could take it back...' wtf? 

they won't split bills.  when my table of seven struggled to organize paying our tab and needed to do two credit card transactions, they refused and gave us some crap about how expensive it is to process credit cards.  YOU RUN A RESTAURANT.  they also don't have debit, for the same reason. 

basically, if you are a snobby beer lover, you'll feel right at home. if you are a regular person who loves a good cask ale, you'll probably put up with the rude service. if you love whiskey (me) you'll go when your friends want you to."}
{"text":"CLOSED.

I can't believe I never reviewed Volo considering it was my most frequented watering hole.

Despite the crowds, excellent craft beer and they play a surprisingly good selection of hip-hop.  Went to their final night in operation (at this location) and pours were cheap, free glassware was given out and they sold the off-menu bottle stock.

They are moving to a new location nearby - which may mean more space and less lining up at the bar.  But this location was perfect - just within stumbling distance of my old place and right by Wellesley station.

Good night, sweet prince."}
{"text":"Good beer. What can I say?"}
{"text":"I really love Bar Volo and I'm so sad it's soon to be another victim of Toronto's condo-mania. It breathes much needed life into the cultural wasteland that is Yonge St between Bloor and College. I thought that with the opening of Wickson Social and Holy Chuck they could start filling in the gap, but alas it wasn't to be.

Bar Volo is the original craft beer place in the city. It has a large number of rotating draft beers, plenty of bottles and upmarket, gastro pub style food. Think chaucuterie plates, gourmet grilled cheeses, pork belly etc. 

The place is pretty cosy (read: small), particularly in winter when the patio is closed. It's dark inside and full of wood. It can also be pretty noisy when full, on Friday or Saturday nights. Thus I preference a midweek jaunt or Sunday afternoon patio sesh.

I've always had good experiences here. The staff are keen and very knowledgeable about their beer. They introduced me to Dieu Du Ciel Rosee d'Hibiscus and I'll never forget it. 

Get in before September when they close for good."}
{"text":"super cute bar in Toronto. you order everything at the bar, food included. the bartender I had was super nice and helpful and recommended beers to us."}
{"text":"This definitely is a \"go to\" joint,  or spot for the dizzying array of beers on tap.  I'll say,  hit it at the sweet spot HH, to try anything without a star next to the name on the board for a discount price.  

Peruse the board,  and look at the side board, as well.  Order by letter or number and they will \"beer you\" up tall and frosty. Even on a blustery, snowy night,  this place can get packed.  You will find your 4-top with your date,  easily become shared with another couple. So don't be alarmed about the communal service. (Bathrooms, on the other hand are downstairs and totally private) cheers to that!  I could have stayed a few hours tasting all kinds of IPA's or even ciders, if you're into that.  (They were so darn tasty and everyone was super nice and knowledgeable. Love that! )

While you enjoy your delightful after-work delight,  perhaps,  you will indulge in the charcuterie. Highly recommended,  a lardo- melt in your mouth fest, chef choices changes, so without getting too detailed,  there are thin sliced meats,  pickles,  mustard and wonderful crusty bread to soak it all up. NOTE: If you need cheese with your meat,  order the \"Baller\". 

I shall return to try more crafted delights!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers on tap! I had an excellent stout from Sawdust City Brewery that was out of this world!!! I wished I wasn't so out of practice so that I could explore more of the local or Canadian beers! My husband and I got the charcuterie plate and it was amazing!!!! The bologne, smoked ham, Iberia ham and prosciutto were delicious. The saluted and fermented shishito peppers were unexpected good and unique! Definitely some of the best that we have had from Seattle to Paris! The bread was amazing! The downside was lack of cheese (which they noted on the menu) on our plate selection. And the place is tiny, so come early to grab a seat!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of interesting where you order your own stuff at the front and the waiter simply leaves you with water. There's a lot of beer to choose from and some tapas. If you're looking for a full meal, this isn't the place to go. If you're looking for a place to drink and socialize with friends, I would recommend this place. I was most impressed that they didn't kick me and my friend out when we only ordered a drink and a tapa but stayed for a good few hours just talking. Props to them for that!"}
{"text":"For beer connoisseurs and fans of great local food, Bar Volo is an excellent place to relax, converse and enjoy. 

Family owned and operated, Bar Volo features great events specific to Ontario/Canadian breweries. 

Cozy space with a great patio, highly recommend the place whether it's after work or on a weekend to relax and watch Yonge Street zoom by.

Bar Volo is a favourite for discovering new beers, food and enjoying time with friends."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this is the perfect bar to visit if you want to sit on a nice patio and never actually drink anything.

Sure the place is trendy and has a large selection of beers on tap, but it's also small, packed to the gills with hipsters, and only has bar service.

That's right... bar service only for $8 hipster pints. Among their 'on tap' selection, they only have 1 lager and a slew of what can otherwise be described as mumbo jumbo mediocrity. 

What's worse is that the single bartender can easily spend upwards of 5 minutes describing beers to each customer ... thus delaying everything even further.

So if you like:
- Long Lines
- Waiting
- Crowded Places
- Mediocre Beer Selection
- Frequently having to walk to the bar again and again 

This is the place for you!
Line right up and get ready to wait!"}
{"text":"Definitely amazing spot for beer. Counter service only, they also have meat platters for you to snack on. Somewhat of a limited seating area so it isn't uncommon to wait for a table on weekends."}
{"text":"I like the beer selection they have, and the food was alright. 

But we waited over 2 hours from the time we entered until we got our food. Place is jam-packed and way too cramped to handle the amount of people that go there. Their staff were too few to efficiently serve everybody, as hard as they tried. 

Parking available in private garages nearby. Neighborhood is disgusting and filled with undesirables."}
{"text":"Amazing craft beer selection and the food is absolutely excellent. The bread and cheese plates are highly recommended as well as the green tomatoes."}
{"text":"Probably has the best beer selection in town. Most of the belgian favorites are in the beer book (my bias) they bring you on a regular basis (though they have been sold out of the westmalle triple more often than i would like). Better prices than ripoff beer markt.

One of their specialties is local ontario micro brews, particularly of the cask variety. Their draft list tends to be around a dozen or so beers, usually giving you the spectrum from IPA to stout. They also make pairing recommendations with the food (which is pretty good too)

Its a small place so depending on how big your group is, you may have to wait a bit for a table, especially around the dinner period. But nice ambience and with a good size patio in the summer."}
{"text":"As boutique beer places go, this place is in the top 5 in the city.

The selection of beers is extensive and the tap selection always features a generous selection of micro-brews and seasonal specials.  There is usually a cask ale of some kind going too.  The cask however is prone to running out quickly because they want to make sure it's always super fresh.

The also have a couple of \"festivals\" every year where they have the patrons sample 4 to 6 different cask ales to either guess which brewery they are from or rate them for quality to determine what cask will get more exposure.  The festivals sadly are short lived because the price to deliciousness ratio makes it an impossible place to avoid.

I've been a patron of Volo for about 6 years now and seen many servers come and go.  They always however seem to know their stuff and are always fast and friendly.  I started coming here for \"pint night\" when any pint was $4.  Eventually they have raised that price to $5 and no longer include every tap...  However, most of them are $5 on pint night so don't dismay!

The food selection is fresh and tasty with specials that have always been delicious.  The food is mid-scale priced Italian with appys from $6 to 14 and entrees from $8 to $25.  Specials are generally in the $14 to $24 range.

If I could really complain about anything it would be the food portion size and price.  But than again, I'm a completely shameless glutton so I'm willing to bet that most except for the ravenous or truly gluttonous like myself will find themselves completely satisfied.  Perhaps this is my starving-artist perspective... I was after all lured here by cheap micro-brews on Monday nights."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner/snack on a Friday summer night. They have a big selection of beers and also some staple bar rail drinks. The tapa style/shareable menu is small but all the items sounded delicious. My friend and I shared a charcuterie board and a sourdough pizzetta - thought we couldn't finish as neither was too hungry but we ended up devouring both items.

We sat by the window and watched passersby and the traffic on the busy Yonge Street. I would definitely come back here again for a chill night out - maybe check out the back patio, which looked like it had cute decor, next time."}
{"text":"I give Volo 5 stars with a caveat.... you have to love craft beer. If you dont like craft beer... or beer at all - dont go here.  Beer is what they do, its what they know, and they are (in my humble opinion) one of the best places in the city to go for craft beer.

Now with that out of the way, let me tell you about Volo.

The beer selection is incredible and it changes all the time. There is no set menu - rather all of their taps/casks are listed on chalkboards. Once they are out of something - they are out. 

Selection changes often but they run the gamut - Saisons, Belgiuns, Stouts, Pilsners, IPAs, double IPAs *yum*, Lagers, etc... something for everyone. And a decent mix of local and foreign.   They also have a small but decent selection of alcoholic cider (apple and pear) for the non-beer drinkers.  

The place is rather small - so you need to get there early to stake out a seat. Its a bit better in the spring/summer when the patio is open.  The people that come here REALLY really like their beer (and are incredibly knowledgeable). Its very common for someone at a neighboring table to ask your thoughts on your current pint and for groups of strangers to decide to push their tables together to form an impromptu tasting circle.

Table service is hit or miss since they did away with food a while back.  They have snacks (mandatory to serve some form of food in a drinking establishment) like marinated  olives, nuts and crackers, various flavours of gourmet potato chips, etc... Not the place to go for dinner. This is strictly to taste and experience beer

Growing up I was never a beer fan, found it tasteless and filling - until I was introduced to craft/micro brews.  There is a huge variety of flavours and styles. If you have ever been curious pop into Volo and start at the top of a chalkboard and work your way down... its an incredible experience!  Sante!"}
{"text":"Bar Volo has an extensive revolving selection of Ontario/ Canada craft brews, including a couple of casks. The patio fills up fast but the big windows open to allow fresh air into the smallish interior. The people watching is great from the patio or a table near the window. This is a great place to pass an evening with friends. 
The staff appeared to be well informed and was friendly. The setting was comfortable and the prices were comparable to other similar pubs. 
This is a must try location for visiting or local beer geeks."}
{"text":"Great little beer bar. Vey extensive beer list and a great food menu. On the day i was there they had some left over cask beer from a cask festival. I had a barleywine it was tasty but not as hoppy as a west coast barleywine so nit quoteu style.

For lunch I had a meat board which had plenty of meat and some awese pretzels. Will likely stop here again,"}
{"text":"Bar Volo is one of the neighbourhood treasures but not quite best kept secrets. The bar is typically packed from wall to wall but with over 26+ beers on tap it's absolutely worth the wait. 

Tip: there's a secret drawer in one of the tables which also has its own Tumblr account."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit here. It's a bit expensive for what it's wroth, but located right in the middle of Yonge St., what else would you expect?

Bar Volo seems to pride themselves in having ingredients that are all locally grown. And everything was pretty tasty. I absolutely love anything pickled and Bar Volo had wide variety of pickled veggies. You are also able to choose from cheeses and meats to create your own charcuterie. I ordered the duck liver patte, which came with bread from a local baker and pickled onions. I also ordered the pulled pork pork sandwich.  

They have tons of beer to order from as well. I really enjoyed the hard cider."}
{"text":"Volo was completely packed when we went on a Tuesday night, and we had to wait around half an hour to be seated. The bar is intimate, and the tables and seating areas are very tightly packed into the room. Still, if you love craft beer, this is the place to go. While I'm not a huge fan, it was still nice to try new ales. I had the Great Lakes Crazy Canuck, and enjoyed it. My date had the Belgian Tripel and I preferred the taste of this. Beware- it's pretty common for them to run out of many of the beers on the menu. But the good news it, their menu is huge. 

The servers are crazy busy, and we were expecting them to take our orders so we sat waiting for a while before approaching them, and discovering they had neglected to inform us we were to order at the bar. After waiting in line to be seated, we then had to wait in line once again at the bar to place orders. Unimpressed with the service- particularly the aussie/new zealand accents of the servers which neither my date or I could understand. The service was not at all friendly. 

As for the food, it mainly consists of snacks. We ordered the chips, and they were unremarkable.

The great thing about this bar is that it is ideal for a date, and for conversation. It's cozy, intimate setting make it very conducive to long conversations. We were there till closing time, and didn't at all notice how quiet it got towards the end. The prices are very reasonable overall, but the long wait times and poor service mean this bar is unappealing to me."}
{"text":"the food was *5 stars* delicious - my friend and i had the veal meatballs, bread with pork fat, prosciutto sandwich, and vegetarian sandwich.

i work in three restaurants so i give a 2 star rating with a heavy heart, because i know what it's like for the restaurants i work at to get bad reviews, but my experience was poor due to the customer service. the two bartenders seemed completely irritated when i asked which pop drinks they have, and when i asked if there's bread and olive oil, one of them practically rolled his eyes at me and said, \"well do you want to have a look at the menu?\" that's not a proper response; he should have explained the options by walking me through the menu, which would have taken 30 seconds, and i would've had a visual to go with the conversation. also, when the host walked by, my friend asked if they stocked rosé and again, she (again) sounded like he inconvenienced her by asking a simple question that requires few words and little time.

considering you have to order at the bar like a fast food restaurant, and that the menu isn't explained to you, the service has to be impeccable everywhere else. i tipped well, as i always do because i'm a server, but the service did not warrant an 18% tip.

the MOST pleasant and professional employee was MARGOT - she was warm, lovely, and made my guest and i feel welcome. i live in the area, and if i peek in while she's working, i'll come back and enjoy the food, which is - by far - the highlight of the night, compared to the employees there."}
{"text":"Un incontournable pour les amateurs de bière de passage à Toronto.  26 bières en fût quand j'y suis passé, dont 4 cask, plus 3 cidres!  Et cela, sans compter un généreuse sélection de bières en bouteille.  Le service est très compétent et professionnel: on comprend que les produits vendus sont testés!  Les prix oscillent entre 6,50$ et 8,75$ la pinte, ce qui est vraiment raisonnable, particulièrement pour Toronto!"}
{"text":"In all the years I've lived in Toronto, I've never been Bar Volo, a mecca for beer lovers.  I've obviously heard of it and knew it was on Yonge Street but I didn't know where.

After Gord and I had lunch, we walked the couple blocks to Bar Volo.  It's at Dundonald Street and I've probably walked by it a million times not realizing it was Bar Volo.

We sat on the patio (it's communal seating).

The way it works is you look at the list of available beer on the chalkboard and then go inside to tell them which letter you'd like.  They have a great selection of craft beer!  I had a couple \"C\" (Sidelaunch Mountain Lager).

At the end of September, they are closing down and moving to a new location so I'm glad I got to be there before the move."}
{"text":"Oh, bar volo. I was so stoked to try this place. I went on st Patrick's day and it was packed. The bartender was rude and refused to answer simple questions, like, what is the price of your cider (pretty sure there were only 2). The hostess wasn't very friendly,  but maybe she was stressed. We joined a table with some other people. 
I thought that was normal.  They did not.
I wasn't feeling the vibe of this place. There isn't a lot of seating. The bar is kind of up some stairs. 
The only person who looked like they were enjoying themselves was the deejay. 
We left shortly after. Bar volo did not leave me wanting to return.
I'd say give Urban House a go if you're in the area and looking for a beer."}
{"text":"Great selection, great staff, REALLY great beer. $5 Pints on monday nights are a real steal. The only thing i wish were nicer here are the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Awesome bar that specializes in make your own boards and snacks! I love that option because every charcuterie or cheese shop we go to, the selections are per-determined. This way we split it up into three courses with three accompanying beers/ciders. Prices are what the expect for a hipster central vibe like Bar Volo but not overwhelming. We had I believe 9 different items in total and ciders and beers to go with and bill was about $100 Canadian which is affordable for how great of a time we had. Be warned, place is tiny and the outdoor patio seating area gets packed quick. We came around 5pm right before the dinner crowd that swarmed in around 6pm. I wish I had a place like this in my neighborhood in NY. Great service at the bar which is where you order both your drinks and food but they bring the food to your table."}
{"text":"An excellent and low-key place to have a pint!  Beer selection is extensive, and equal to places (read: Bier Markt) that are 10x the size of this little gem of a bar.  Staff are attentive & friendly, and most importantly well versed in the menu - their servers seem to consist exclusively of beer afficionados.  Ideal for a chillin' night with a few friends."}
{"text":"had a very nice first date here. I remember the light being really nice. the noise level was just enough - you'd lean together to talk when it's busy, then lean back. comfortable. the beer range is huge (and tasty. I'd be comfortable choosing at random). the servers were knowledgeable. the place felt sturdy and clean. 

one note - order beer by the letter it's listed under, not it's name. 
food was okay as I recall, but I had one random dish and wasn't there for that so who cares."}
{"text":"Love the vibe and furniture. But hate how insanely hot it is. I went here on a date. The date flopped but the restaurant was a keeper. Loved the drink selections. Hated that they did not have airconditioning. It was HOT! But I would still return. Oh, and the waiter was hot. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go for a casual drink with friends or to go for a first date!

I've had several separate first dates here and the low-key atmosphere definitely helps get past the awkward first meeting. Most people are super surprised to see such a great bar on Yonge st these days, so it's a real stand out place if you're a fan of places like Bellwoods Brewery. As with Bellwoods, BarVolo brews a lot of their own beers and has an ever-changing menu which is both a good and bad thing. I've had a couple great beers here that I haven't been able to find again because they're always updating the beer list. Sometimes, it's hard to find a beer you like that suits your budget because there are so many options. I'm no beer aficionado but everything I've had there is pretty decent, and the servers are very knowledgeable and can recommend a good drink for you depending on your tastes.

The food is pretty good and it's fun to share the little plates with a date or friends. The charcuterie is decent and is always changing too, depending on what's fresh and available. It's kind of a small place with communal tables as well as small private tables. In the summer, there's more seating on the patio which can alleviate wait times, but in the winter, I've had to wait up to 30 minutes to get seated. But the wait time is usually quite quick -- quicker than you expect. There's also a more casual \"mingling\" area on the upper level by the bar where you can stand while you drink and wait for a table to become available, so it never seems like too long a wait, and the servers are quite good about notifying you in a timely manner.

Really love this place, love that it's away from the predictable areas like Parkdale or Queen west. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about what Ralph has done for the beer scene in Toronto. Cask days, bottle selection, beer pairings, support for craft brewers, casks on tap, and nano brewing. It's one of the places I miss most as I no longer live in Ontario. Still, I manage to get back here at least a few times every time I'm back in town and I'm never disappointed. Keep doing what you're doing."}
{"text":"\"Look! There are sooo many guys in there!\" cooed a pair of ladies evidently out on the prowl as we parked our bikes out front. While this is generally true on most nights, there is much more than a full house of men behind the doors and fenced off sidewalk patio of Volo. The humongous beer selection, extremely knowledgeable and friendly staff, tasty food, great decor, large group and date friendly seating arrangements, and prime Yonge Street people watching location are all very good reasons to go in for a pint or five.

Don't hesitate to ask your server for suggestions or a small sample of a beer that you'd like to try (as long as it's on draft or cask) before you commit to a whole pint. They're incredibly patient and passionate about their beer."}
{"text":"fantastic beer. i had 5 or 6 pints over 6 hours, all different, and all very tasty. i strongly recommend the barley wine -- it's not the best barley wine i've ever had, but it was very good, and how many places have barley wine on tap?

and so cozy! a nice little fire going. i wish the heat reached where we were sitting by the patio door, which was a little cool due to a faint draft.

our server was this english guy, very cute, but a little clueless. he didn't seem very sure of himself. at one point, he listed 4 beers to choose from and my friend said \"i'll take the 2nd one\" and he replied \"oh, i don't remember which one that was. hmm.. let me list them again.\" 

there were many such moments. luckily they were all delivered with good cheer.

finally, one very strange thing: they didn't have french fries on their menu. that seems extremely odd for a pub. on the plus side, the chef offered to make a side of sliced potatoes for us -- nice, but they were far too spicy!

so, a little rough around the edges, but the core is right.

have you ordered the barley wine yet?"}
{"text":"Great little brasserie for my first beer in Toronto. Lucky enough to have my friend live nearby and we met up with him after work. 

Fun ambiance, and the after work crowd was very loud. It was crowded, but amiable instead of pushing people out of our way. It's a shame it was  bit too cold to sit outside. The tin roof, wooden bar and tables, and Edison style light-bulbs do excite the latent hipster within myself.

Amazing selection of local-ish beers. I was a bit disappointed they were served in wine glasses... you're paying the same price for less beer. 

Service was friendly and professional, although the bartender gave me \"the stare\" when I asked for a glass of red wine for my girlfriend. Yes, I know this establishment is known for beer, and yes, my girlfriend has a gluten sensitivity. Sorry... #sarcasm.

Would I come back? You bet, and I would make sure to order some food next time too!"}
{"text":"Can I say beer selection? Wait... I know I'm severely north of the Mason Dixon line, but can I say Bourbon!? Mix these two things with a knowledgeable staff and thus is a place that can't be beat. Top that with, quote me now, I believe I received a smile from every staff member that waked by my table. (Starting with Paulina) I will be back definitely"}
{"text":"We finally got to visit this place during an unexpected jaunt downtown for a pan am games at Ryerson. Nice walk from Yonge and Carleton. 
Anyways, loved the ambience. The patio was quite busy so we settled for a table just below the bar. 
Ordering was a little bit confusing so I helter skeltered the whole act of choosing a beer and opted for 1 of the 2 wine options. Whatever. At the point in time, I just needed some alcohol!! Sorry!

We ordered a the pre-set charcuterie board and a pizza. The meats were fantastic along with the most delicious pickle I've ever had. :)  pizza had a great crust. 

Service was quick and friendly. Wish we didn't have to go to the bar to order food but still a great spot and would go back if ever in the area."}
{"text":"If there was any hidden gem I'd recommend to Torontonian beer lovers, this would be it! Tons of local craft brews, a cozy bar feel, and really down to earth bartenders - it's a place that I'll come back to every trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been to Volo a few times as it's not too far from work. They have a medium sized patio for summer days and a cozy interior with great decor which is quite perfect for winter snuggly days.

If you are into craft beers then you will likely love it here. They have a large menu which changes on a weekly or sometimes even daily basis.

I am sometimes quite miffed by the prices. The other day I paid $9 for a cider and it came out in a smaller 300mL sized glass. For $9 I was expecting a pint! Beer does seem a bit better priced though. Their wine selection is reasonable but I think they could beef it up a bit.

Nice looking food menu as well but I've never tried anything.

Service here somewhat stresses me out. Lots of confusion each time. Yesterday, for example, we arrived promptly at 5pm and the patio was nearly empty. Rather than escorting us out to the patio, the hostess asked us to \"wait\" in the doorway while she \"found\" us a table. We were left standing there 5 minutes and asked by two other staff whether we had been helped already or not. Getting the bill and paying always seems to be a gongshow here too."}
{"text":"I might be a little too harsh on the rating of this place, but I have come to a decision that 4 and 5 stars are reserved for places that I have to go back to rather than continue on my restauranting tour of Toronto. I really like this place overall and would go back if the opportunity presented itself, but the location is a little out of the way for me with the Beer Bistro being a lot closer for comparable choices.

I went here on a Friday night to check out the many positive reviews of this place and peruse their 'extensive' beer list. I will confirm there are plenty of beer choices, and I had the opportunity to explore many of the different beers they offer.

I had a beer called Ephemere (an apple wheat beer), which has become one of my all time favourite beers. There were a handful of other beers I tried which were mostly good, and some not so good.

Our server was helpful in recommending some beers to choose, and the patio is a nice place to sit. Be careful of that summer 5pm sun because it can make the patio hot! This place is also a little smaller than I anticipated, with only about maybe 10 tables inside.

The only bad thing I can say about this place is their washrooms. You have to go to the basement and on the way down there is a distinct smell the moment you hit the stairs and in the bathroom. I wouldn't say that the bathrooms are disgusting because they do look like they are cleaned, but the source of this smell needs to be found."}
{"text":"I love beer. Apparently I always love the beer that Volo has just run out of. Every single time. This isn't so cute after the 5th time. In my opinion, the food is overrated, but if you want to sit down anywhere but in the tiny bar section, you have to order food - even if the restaurant is empty. Thank god Volo has a good beer selection because it certainly doesn't win any points in customer service or stellar food."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and great beer selection. We had their sandwiches which were amazing. Unfortunately a bit small and somewhat pricy. Still a very nice place!"}
{"text":"We went to Bar Volo on a sunny and hot Sunday to sit on the patio and enjoy some beer. Bar Volo has a great selection of beer on tap and some ciders as well. 

The food is also delicious. We ordered the veal meatballs, which were tender, juicy and extremely flavourful. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the portion. The bartender suggested we order the rustic bread to soak up the remaining sauce. The bread was crusty on the inside and came with some nice olive oil/pepper flakes to dip it in. 

We also had the BKT sandwich. It had bacon, tomato and was topped with kale caesar salad. This was a really satisfying sandwich with some surprising flavours (I think there was a tapenade on it as well).  

The one thing I will say is it's sometimes slow waiting in line at the bar to order. Otherwise, Bar Volo is a great place hang out with friends for the afternoon."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: The best beer bar in town. Period. I've tried everything else (C'est What, Beer Station, Victory Cafe, Beer Bistro, Bier Markt, Monk's Table, Sin and Redemption, Village Idiot, Rhino, et cetera.).

I love beer. A lot. And this is a beer lover's paradise! I've been coming here with friends for over 5 years on a near weekly basis (it's the only thing that makes Mondays great - $5 pint nights!) and it just keeps on getting better and better (and this is in spite of Ontario's fascist liquor laws and ridiculously restrictive business practices). 

Their selection, as other Yelpers have clearly written about, is immense, but what keeps me coming back is the frequent rotation on tap, their staff's knowledge of all beer-related paraphernalia and the ridiculously nerdy beer convos you can have with them on a slow night!

Best of all are their events they hold to bring in draft and cask beers from all over Canada, the US and Europe - that as mentioned above, couldn't ordinarily be served (legally). 

Last night night I attended their Dieu Du Ciel (Montreal) event where they had 20 of their beers on tap and were open till 4AM. The place was packed and the line-up was long, so when I got to the front I ordered 2 beers (the Peche Mortel - of course - and tried their Saison w/ Japanese Peppers - a nice amount of spice!). My friends tried the India Cream Ale and the Japanese Sour Plum.

They recently revamped their menu into more charcuterie plates and smaller dishes that I can't comment too much on since I usually stick to a liquid diet. In the past, I've often found their food somewhat underwhelming and overpriced; however, I think the proper mindset is to order a beer and then ask what items on their menu would pair well with it. :)"}
{"text":"Bar Volo is a relatively new destination for beer enthusiasts. They have one of the most extensive selections of micro/nano brews that I've seen. They have more than a 100 Belgian, Quebecois, and American craft beer bottles, about a dozen on tap, and a couple of house ales. The house ale recommended to us by the waiter was incredibly tasty, complex, and fragrant. Consider Radishe du Cheval when you're there. The atmosphere is intimate, dark, and a little on the stuffy side in my opinion. I find the patio to be far more laid-back. What I like about this place is their selection of unique appetizers. I was very impressed by the charcuterie platter. Five different cured meats (I believe they were porchetta, boar prosciutto, calabrese, and caribou), olives, pickles, mustard, and  pretzels arranged on a wooden board. With all of that said, this place has yet to stand the test of time, as most great bars should."}
{"text":"Great venue for beer. Very hipster and they serve good but pricey food. Watch out for the crowds, go early to get a seat outside. There's a large selection of beers that are mostly local. Would come early, say 5 or 6 pm to secure a table. After that it can be a 30 minute wait, if not longer. Important: no service. You need to order everything at the bar, including food."}
{"text":"Went to Volo with the hubby last Thursday and I loved it!
The have hundreds of beers including local Ontario Craft beers and fancy imports. The service was impeccable and the staff was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their beers.

The was food was incredible. I started with the Pane appetizer; artesian bread with olive oil. I know it doesn't should like much but it was awesome. 

Next I have the Pollo sandwich, which was tender chicken breast, boston lettuce, double smoked bacon, smoked cheddar and caesar mayo.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A lot of people have recommended this place and a friend finally dragged me here the other day. The place is very small and they have a lovely patio but again, it was really small. We were lucky enough to snag a seat just as someone else was leaving as you seat yourself at this place. You also have to go up to the bar and order yourself. 

If you're into craft beer you would love this place, the selection is amazing! There's a huge blackboard with all of the different beers and some quick stats on each one. We started a tab and started experimenting (ahem drinking). I loved loved loved this delicious rose hibiscus beer from Belgian so much that my friend looked into it and found out where else we could get it :) 

It was such a great place to chill and relax for a casual drink with friends and explore some new beers. Only problem was the patio was really small and there were all these plants on top of the patio that kept shedding. Literally, it was raining little green things the entire time and it got all over our hair and drinks. It was funny at first but then got annoying, maybe it was really windy that day and its normally fine. 

Overall, barVolo was nice - there really wasn't much else immediately nearby so I would probably swing by again if I don't plan on heading up to Yorkville. For anyone who loves beer - you would probably appreciate this place a lot more than me as I'm still getting into the whole craft beer thing."}
{"text":"My fav bar in the city!

Been here MANY times and have never once been disappointed.  The beer list is always changing and there are just so many options for craft beer lovers.

The food is also amazing with tons of charcuterie items to choose from.

It's a small bar so if you end up on a busy night you may have to wait awhile for a table.  Luckily there is a bit of free space near the bar so you can hang out there as well."}
{"text":"Nice place overall. Loud, with young people,and I would say a good place to have a few beers/drinks. A lot of them to select! the catalog was overwhelming.

we also had a pork pie (well, as a greek, I have to say that this was a slice of a regular greek pie), the veal meatballs and a spicy sausage. all of them were good (especially the tomato sauce from the meatballs).

very friendly stuff."}
{"text":"I almost think I am at an UYE during my visit at Volo on a Saturday evening!!

Patio.......nice Patio overlooking Yonge Street..... I ran in and grab a seat with a nice view and then I realized I know those yelpers sitting at the table right next to me... \"Hi there!\"

Good Selections of Beers on draft with their distance from Volo noted on the chalkboard. I love choices and I hate choices... I just randomly picked something by the number.......

My Yelp Drinking Buddy finally waltzing in, taking his sweet time.... after placing his drinks...(I am sure he too just pick something that sounded good by random) another Yelper walked........... 

Now I believe Volo's Patio is the spot to be hang and to be seen by Yelp community!

Food looks and smells deliciously, but it seemed like it took forever to arrive........ thanks again for Eric M and Mike S for letting me taking photos of their food.......... now if I can have a taste of them it would have been awesome!! :P"}
{"text":"Great bar with a great selection of beers! I just wish it was bigger as it is quite difficult to get a table or sometimes even to get a drink on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Beer 5/5: great selection, easy map.

Service 5/5: helpful staff, friendly

Location 5/5: central street. Downtown. Street parking. 

Price 4/5: fair for such huge selection

Will BE BACK."}
{"text":"A great place for brews and bites, Bar Volo offers up great fare in a down-to-earth yet hip environment.

My friend and I came here for dinner last night and in addition to our brews, ordered shares of the pickles, the rustic bread, the ricotta, and the boquerones. Everything was delectable, but my favorite by far were the boquerones, which reminded me of Spain.

I was not a fan of the set-up, though. One must order at the bar, and seat oneself at a communal table. The bar, in the back and narrow and generally small, can get crowded and awkward. Also, if you plan to order more than one round, you either have to pay as you go or start a tab, which means leaving your card at the bar."}
{"text":"I've been to Bar Volo a few times and never really had a bad time. The patio is a great spot to relax and unwind with friends while enjoying a bite to eat or the many beers on tap.

In the past I've had the formaggio board, which included three artisanal cheeses from Quebec and were absolutely fantastic. Tonight, I kept it simple and went with the margherita pizza and house salad. The pizza was great, which I felt was made in large part because of the high-quality cheese that was used to make it. The salad however lacked any real punch to it. The greens were fresh, but for whatever reason the vinaigrette was flavourless. It's unfortunate because I felt like it had the chance to be a great way to finish off the meal. 

I also found it quite odd that for an establishment that has Italian items throughout a majority of the menu, they didn't have any espresso or cappuccino available as a drink following our meal. It left me a bit disappointed and if there was a 3.5 star I'd be inclined to give it on this review, but I'll leave it at a 4 because I'm in a good mood.....and it has nothing to do with the pints of Beau's!"}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing. The selection of beers, whiskey, cheeses, nuts, jam, everything is great!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite bars. Great microbrew beer selection. Great decor. This is the place you come to if you want to taste some good beers."}
{"text":"A really nice atmosphere and great tap list!

Seriously, this place was top notch. Great prices and great service. I love the decor and seating. The bathrooms were also clean and very nice. It was small, but I prefer that overall in a craft beer bar! Definitely go!"}
{"text":"Oh, elusive Volo.  First time we were an hour early -- ok, that's my fault for not double checking the time.  Second time, you were opening a half hour late.  We came back later that day and found out the late opening was due to new staff being trained.  Our luck was not improving as we sat patiently with empty beer glasses and waited longingly for our cheese plate.

Third time proved to be the charm tho.  The schedule was cleared, the patio was rocking and I got to chat with a nice waiter about certain hard to find Canadian beers that proved to be liquid gold to this New Englander.

It took some determination but it was worth it.  A fine beer bar.  The chalkboard draught list is usually a sure sign of a respectable place and Volo is no exception to that rule."}
{"text":"Everything you read in the other reviews is correct:

Smallish place, kinda hard to find (no sign but come on - you have an address above), yes the run out of some beers sometimes, have to go to bar to order everything, only cash or Visa (weird), little pricy, bla, bla, bla...

I'd love to find a place like this in Dallas, where the hipsters don't make the place unapproachable.  Daily beer menu that changes, home brews, absolutely great menu for what it is (the venison sausage and chicken liver pate - excellent).

Friday night - got in about 5:30 - got a seat outside.  read the paper and people watched.  Quite content.

Funny how most out-of-towners love this place, while the locals only see the negatives..."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is not a eating place and there is no pretention that it is.  This is a very focused drinking pub at its best - crazy selection of craft beers and wide selection of cured meat, cheese, and picked veggies.  It was pricy but it was great.  The line is annoying so you have to come in early.  I liked their pork pate as well as cheese, high quality but lack in quantity.  But that is ok, they are meant to be just beer snack, not dinner.  I will come again."}
{"text":"I love this little hipster haven. The place is almost ALWAYS packed and it's annoying that you have to go to the bar to order everything (food and drinks), but not sad. The bartenders will point you in the right direction if you're overwhelmed by the selection and I have yet to try a beer that wasn't distinctive and tasty. 

But the real reason I love Bar Volo is their charcuterie board. On my last visit we ordered a Big Boi platter because I couldn't decide if I wanted meat or cheese or pickles (seriously, it's like asking me to pick my favorite kid).   But holy jeez! I was just expecting some meat, cheese, pickles, and condiments. We got all of that, but we also got: a mini pesto pizza AND a skillet of cheese covered meatballs AND these fried pork fat things that can only be described as decadent. Yes, it was $40 but we (two of us) left fully satisfied. And what I really love is that the next time I go, and I can't make up my mind, I can order the same platter and probably have a completely different selection! LOVE."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday, right when it opened - we were the first ones there.  The decor is rustic and charming, super hipster.   They had their patio open as well, but no heaters, so it was a bit cold.  

You have to go up to the bar to order, which was interesting, not a big deal.    They have a TON of lovely beer selections, and some nice non-alcoholic ciders to choose from as well.  I tried a cranberry apple cider and it was super tasty.   The menu has many DIY charcuterie board options, as well as a flat $40 or $65 for a sampling of lots of things.   We were going to try the $65, but were recommended to go for the $40 for 2 people.  Glad we did, it was large and was the perfect amount for two. 

There was duck gizzard pate, cheeses, pickled veggies and eggs, salamis, capocollo, olives, marmalade, sun dried tomatoes, mustard, fennel sauasage, a slice of quiche pizza, and pears, nuts and other delightful goodies.    There was also peanut butter bacon fudge for dessert.   

The tastes were delightful, and the options were endless.   What a great place!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beer.  Intimate setting inside and a great patio when its warmer out.  They usually play some pretty good 90s hip hop too."}
{"text":"Very decent craft beer bar with wide selection of beers 

My favourite was the Kentucky Baster Bourbon Barrel Aged Beer ~ feels like an old world red wine  soul in a beer body. A note of black plum  and layers of depth.  

And the other one is much lighter and Golden ~ I believe it was Q: Dieu du ciel sth sth ~ love the light sprit but with a sense Chardonnay in it. 

Just come here and see for yourself ! 

Also ordered the pomplette ( Italian meat ball) finger licking delicious! Used all the bread and tomato sauce"}
{"text":"Vraiment une belle découverte. Assiettes réconfortantes et sélection de bières impressionnante. Excellent service. Une chaude recommandation."}
