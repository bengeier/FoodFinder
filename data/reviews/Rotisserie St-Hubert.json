{"text":"You never go wrong with St-Hubert.  Golden orange brown rotisserie chicken that is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, consistently, every time and today, there was no exception to that tradition! 

This kiosk is located at the upper food court, pre-security departures level, at the Montreal International Airport.  Add to the great chicken the usual menu favorites: traditional non creamy coleslaw, gravy bbq sauce, Apple pie & the trimmings and you're back to a flash of childhood comfort right at the terminal before taking the plane; bon voyage! #yummy"}
{"text":"So overpriced. The quality of the food is lower than at other St-Hubert restaurants but the price is way higher... airports. Go figure! 

I got a chicken wrap combo with a drink - I thought the drink would be included but it wasn't. A small fountain drink cost me $3.49 + tax! Of course I would have said no if I knew it was extra. $17.50 for what usually costs me around $12...

The fries were cold and the \"creamy coleslaw\" was not creamy at all. I threw out most of it but the chicken wrap was good. I'll check-in then go find a restaurant inside the terminal next time!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't too bad of an option for a stop while at the Montréal Airport. The fare is way overpriced, so I ordered a kids meal. My dish consisted of some pretty sweet animal-shaped chicken nuggs, french fries, juice and a squeezy apple sauce. I think the squeezy apple sauce was my favorite part of the meal. I don't really recommend trying this restaurant out but, if you must eat here the food really isn't too horrible. My boyfriend ordered the other kids meal (again, the food is super overpriced) and he received a rotisserie chicken, in place of the nuggs that I received, along with the other extras that came with my meal. His meal looked a bit tastier so maybe order the rotisserie chicken meal rather than the fried meal."}
{"text":"Ils n'ont pas les items qu'ils affichent dont le wrap au poulet. Propreté inquiétante. La personne au comptoir ne parle presque pas français. La nourriture est servie en 2 minutes a peine tiède. A éviter comme restaurant."}
{"text":"So I ended up spending 3 extra hours in the airport I ended up needing to eat.

I ordered a chicken poutine... I received a 1/4 chicken dinner and just took it because at that point I had, had a fairly rough day and just needed sustenance. The food court seating was packed so I ended up eating my meal on a bench. Overall the food was good but the circumstances and service were less than desirable"}
{"text":"Sadly leaving Montreal heading back home to Vancouver... I saw.... in the airport.... a St. Hubert BBQ. (Rotisserie my ass bill 101)

Anyway, I ordered a meal, and it was the same exact perfect salty chicken, fries and coleslaw that forms 26% of my DNA having grown up in Montreal. But the part that made me smile is that they give you a wee tub, and you go to the hot BBQ sauce dispenser and fill it. Oh and I filled it... then I dumped it on my chicken and then floated the fries in it.... then went back for more from the dispenser.

I won't lie... the thought crossed my mind to just put my mouth under the nozzle. But just for a second. 

Oh how I miss thee St. Hubert.... Swiss Chalet out here in BC just doesn't measure up...."}
{"text":"Realistically, this is a generous 3 stars, considering the competition at the airport. Want a reliably decent meal quickly and that wont break the bank, considering the prices of most airport restaurants? They have you covered. 

They are located in front of security, just on the other side of Air Canada check in. 

I'll take off a half star because it is inconvenient if you are on the wrong side of security and half star for prices.  But if you haven't crossed security, stop here with your loved ones before your trip.  There are lots of cafeteria style seats, and people gaze endlessly as you kill some time before going through security. 

We were served immediately both times I came here. The portions were filling and i recommend the fried chicken poutine."}
