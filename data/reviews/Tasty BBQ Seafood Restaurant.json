{"text":"Food was pretty good
Price was reasonable
But,  dishes were a bit small
Would I go back... probably yes, but will not go out of way to go there... only if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I wanted to get take out but the 2 waitress standing in front of me completely ignored me. One looked at me and went off to serve tables. Typical rude canto people. A group of 3 came in and the other waitress went to greet them..really?? I had to approach her and ask her for a manu while she walks away with the other customer and she ignores me. I ended up asking the cashier for a menu. They were so rude I just went to the restaurant next door. 

I've been here before with a group of friends and the same thing happened. We were all seated and the waitress gave a group of five 1 menu...I wanted a noodle soup that was available all day but it was on the lunch menu. The waitress didnt even bother listening. She just kept saying the lunch chef left....really??? then what does it say on your menu??? Frustrating rude people."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant tonight and we ordered the \"double lobsters combo for four\". 
The lobster dish looked good and the size is good enough for four people. However, some of the lobster tasted not fresh at all. We talked to the manger of the restaurant regarding our concern, he said one of the lobster called \"water lobster\" (????which tasted very different from the regular one. We could not accept the explanation as we never heard about that and not dare to eat it again.
Later, the manger offered us a 10% discount off on the whole bill (around $7) which we did not accept. He finally exchanged a \"normal\" tasting lobster with the \"water lobster\"
I am not going this place again as  I felt the manager was making fool of us by giving out such an explanation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time today, just went in on a whim cause we were starving. We ordered the fried chilli prawns, sweet and sour pork, and fried rice noodles and beef in soy sauce. The prawns were delicious, the serving size was huge! I've never gotten so many prawns for $8 in my life. The sweet and sour pork was one of the best I've ever had, the pork was cooked perfectly and the sauce was not overly sweet. The noodles and beef were okay, the beef was cooked perfectly, but there just wasn't much flavour overall. 

The service was very slow but we figured for the price and the tasty food it was worth the wait. Our bill came out to $22.90 for the 3 dishes which is insane. The waitress told is it was cash only, so my bf ran to the bank to quickly draw some cash, and we happily put down a $5 tip because we were so pleased and stuffed from the food. 

This is where things went downhill. We waited literally 20 minutes with our cash on the table as the waitress repeatedly walked past our table without attending to us (I was going to ask for change because I left $30, and I wanted $5 back). She  stood next to us and collected dishes in a bin for a while, deliberately with her back to us. We eventually got fed up with being ignored so I took back my $10 and we left $23 exactly and started walking.

As we got to the door we were stopped by our waitress, she showed us our bill, and she asked us 'where is your tip?'. I couldn't believe what I just heard. I explained to her that we had been waiting for 20 minutes with our tip on the table as she walked passed us multiple times and ignored us, and this is why we decided to not tip. She looked at us in confusion and asked us again to tip her, at which point we just said we're sorry but you should really attend to your customers more and we left. 

As good and cheap as the food was, I won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good. We went there for dinner. It was oily and very little flavor. We ordered a total of 8 dishes. The ginger onion lobster didn't have the wok taste to it and was missing a lot of flavor. It was also too wet. The Peking duck was the best dish we ordered, but even that was mediocre. Duck was pretty oily and the wrap wasn't that great. The accompaniments were lacking as well. 

However, the reason for the 1 star rating was for 2 reasons: 

1: we go our table after waiting for half hour and there were no chairs. The table was completely not ready and the workers were scurrying around trying to find us 5 chairs. Didn't apologize or anything. 

2: the fact that they were stacking chairs (at around 8pm) and they fell over onto our table. If my father didn't go to the men's room he would have been severely injured. I'm talking about 15 chairs not just 4 or 5. They asked if anyone was injured a bunch of times, but felt like it was so we wouldn't sue or complain more so than out of concern. We asked for the bill and didn't make a big deal out of it. If this happened at a Caucasian restaurant we would have gotten a free meal or a discount, but of course nothing was done. I didn't want to leave a tip, but my father insisted. 

Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Like any other typical chinese cafe/restaurant, it's busy, cheap and provides lots of choices.

What used to be Grass Mountain Villa Restaurant who was dim sum serving by day and gourmet chinese feast by night, has been transformed into a more simple and faster chinese cafe restaurant. 

They have many focuses ranging from bbq meats, fresh seafood, baked rice/spaghetti dishes and breakfast style meals. Each meal typically comes with a drinks, especially during the lunch specials. They have combos to choose from which can consist of a bowl of noodle soup, egg sandwich and a drink for a cheap as $5.

The service is fair. Just don't expect fine service as you would at a Milestones or Moxies. It's simply a typically hong kong style eatery where you get fast service and fast meals for cheap prices. You're literally in and out within 30 mins.

The restaurant is clean however it did just open several months ago so give it time and it'll get grungy. 

The plaza is pretty competitive with Pho Vietnamese Delight, Congee Delight, and the new AYCE japanese restaurant (name cannot recall). Since the inception of Tasty BBQ Seafood Restaurant, they have already bumped off Fantaxia, who is now the new AYCE japanese restaurant. Lets see who else the can compete with.

The parking is not good at all with a No Frills at the same location. So you'll need to be ready to park far. My suggestion is to just park by the Pizza Hut and walk.

Anyways, overall if you want a quick and decently priced meal, then check out this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went at odd hours like past 4pm.  There is no afternoon tea menu (not like the previous menu selection was my fave).

We ordered roast bird, chicken pot rice, and wonton noodles.

Their roast birds (????are good as always (Toronto standard).  The chicken rice pot is decent.  It has fried rice with Chinese sausages.  The heat in clay pot makes the rice crispy.  Chicken is so-so.

Service is decent.  Ambience is clean.

Overall will come back for roast birds and it's proxy location to no frills."}
{"text":"This is a Cantonese seafood place with big round tables and large menu. They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner options.

I came here during lunch time but ordered a (dinner) lobster combo for (intended for 4 people). The combo comes with lobster (you get to choose which sauce), either chicken or cha siu, either spare ribs or sweet/sour pork and a plate of vegetables/mushrooms.

Everything tasted really fresh. The lobster was great... This combo came with 2 lobsters which was more than enough for 3 people and I'd imagine would be a good portion for 4. Sweet and sour pork was crunchy, unlike some places that serve it soggy.

We did have to order steam rice separately as it's not part of the combo, but it was only 4.5 for 3 bowls. The price for the combo was reasonable too, given the amount of food. We took a lot of the food home as we were not able to finish.

I came here based on a friend's recommendation and I'm happy to find a good restaurant in this area. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very bad service. The food I ordered never came when my partners already finished their meal. When I told the cashier about it, she took it off the bill without saying anything. Please save your money and time, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Saturday. The place wasn't too busy. We ordered 5 breakfast combos for 5 people but the portions were HUGE! The noodle soups were quite tasty and came with a drink. I think one bowl could have fed 2 people so just be wary of portion sizes when ordering. The ham, egg and toast plate was reasonably sized. Would come back again because it is just so affordable!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of selections. But very good price and reasonable food quality. I love the combo because it come with hong kong tea."}
{"text":"Interesting. This place used to be Grass Mountain Villa - a dim sum joint tucked away in the plaza at Finch & Don Mills. I guess they had a reno recently, and have since opened up as an HK cafe of sorts, but is lacking the usually Western options that you would find in a HK cafe. My go to option, baked spaghetti, doesn't exist on their menu, but things like soft shell crab fried rice is there. So confusing.

I will say that they have a decent cheap breakfast menu, with options going anywhere from $5 to $8 that includes a drink. I stopped by the other day and had spam with eggs and toast for $5 which was nothing spectacular, but it hit the spot. I'd be interested in trying their lunch menu, so I'll for sure stop by another day.

The place is nice and clean though, the renos certainly made it look a lot nicer. Strange, there was no BBQ hanging anywhere in the windows, maybe it was just the day I was there?"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there tonight... terrible service. We ordered six dishes and there was a long wait between the dishes. When the last dish was finally brought to the table, they gave us the bill and immediately followed with the complementary dessert. We hadn't even finished with dinner and the wait staff started clearing our table. When we said we weren't finished, they replied that we had been there too long and they had people waiting. We told them that they were rude and the waitress pretended she spoke no English. We complained to the owner and he also just shrugged. Don't bother eating here. We won't be coming back and we are making sure anyone else we know isn't going to bother either!  Skip this spot, there are so many other Chinese restaurants that value customer service!"}
{"text":"I've got to say that this is the oddest name for a restaurant. I would not be a fan of BBQ Seafood... Maybe it's just a case of lost in translation.

The restaurant was pretty busy when we went in on a Sunday night, but it quickly died down after people ate. The restaurant got progressively emptier, and we were one of only 3 tables left at only 8:30pm. Not a good sign when even the staff start to head out before the restaurant closes.

The food was mediocre at best, but there were a couple dishes that were okay. The service wasn't that great either, with servers not communicating with each other regarding dishes that came to the table. We didn't get enough chicken and the bill came to us twice (and they even expected us to pay the second time).

Not a place I would probably visit again..."}
{"text":"Need to update review since I feel that the food and service has improved since last time. Also I'm giving them four stars since I think they have pretty decent HK style breakfast. 

They have everything you want in terms of HK style breakfast for a great price. I ordered sausage and egg vermicelli and it comes with a drink. Of course I ordered my fav HK style milk tea  and it was excellent which is not easy to make. So they got an extra star from me. The sandwich and pork chops were pretty good too. The bread was nicely toasted and the pork chop crispy. These places are hard to find nowadays. We had dinner here before and their dishes are okay, crab, lobster pretty standard but the four people meal sets are very economical. 

Service seems better I've had a few good waitresses so it's a hit or miss thing. The restaurant is newly renovated, but the washrooms a bit dirty. So if you want decent Chinese food for a good price give this place a try. As others have mentioned CASH only!!!"}
{"text":"Where Grass Mountain used to be, now there is a new Chinese restaurant of HK cafe style.  Typical menu...lots of congee, noodle, and rice dishes as well as regular stuff featuring Cantonese seafood.  Banquet dinner for 4 or 6 or more looks quite good and reasonably priced.

A good addition to the area."}
{"text":"I came here under the impression that they served a great peking duck dinner, but it was only mediocre. We then ordered 4 other dishes, all of which were disappointing. 

1) Using the leftover peking duck, we ordered the bitter melon dish and it was extremely greasy. The pieces of duck were lacking meat and the cooking method made the sauce overly thick and sticky.

2) The fried tofu, shrimp, and pepper dish was just straight up MSG. Not really sure what I was eating because everything tasted the same - overpoweringly salty. 

3) The bokchoi and mushroom dish was considerably the \"best\" one but the sauce was still too thick. It felt pretty gross eating mouthfuls of sauce that were fully absorbed by the veggies.

4) The broccoli, fried tofu, snow peas dish was just.. extra. Honestly didn't taste much different from the above dishes because they used the same thickened sauce. 

5) The sauce for the sweet and sour pork was surprisingly not too sticky. The downfall for this dish was in the quality of the meat itself - most pieces were just fat and there was a lack of actual pork.

Overall, I was highly unimpressed with this restaurant and will not be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a solid 3 1/2 stars. Standard Chinese cuisine, I think the bbq meats are pretty well done and are a notch better than most places. Best dish was the duck.. crispy skin with moist fall off the bone meat. Very tender and delicious. The other dishes are average. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We (NYCBC ESC) come here every week after church. Service is decent. The food/dishes are not bad. I'd say the prices are agreeable especially if you're a student or on a budget. The circle tables are good for groups :) their lunch specials are great! Don't know why the ratings are so low. Never had a substantial problem in our regular visits (minor blips here and there), the staff know us so they always accommodate for us. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome  food they don't  speak English  well or at all. Gen tao chicken and salmon terriaki are my fav"}
{"text":"Tasty BBQ is solidly a hair above average. From time to time, they lack consistency, but it's not a significant deficiency. On this one occasion, the lobster dish was extremely salty. 

As an average restaurant with good pricing, this place makes for a casual meal with family and friends."}
{"text":"I come here in the afternoons for their set meals, so don't quote me for any dinner details (after 6pm).

I love coming here for their afternoon tea sets, because they come with HK-style drinks and are quite affordable. You'll agree once you see how many plates are placed on the table - you will feel bad for the dishwasher. I usually order from their {All Day Combo} or {Combo} menu because it's available all day (before 6pm). From their Combo menu, all their items come with hearty toast & eggs, and that's where you'll find the value of coming here.

{Lunch Specials} is a typical HK-style menu - lots of HK staples - you can't go wrong with it and the portions are filling. I think their food is consistent.

Service, however, is very inconsistent, (I've had some substandard experiences here myself), but I'm quite forgiving because I've seen those servers there all day, everyday. It's practically their home. So I don't blame 'em. I really don't expect compassionate service here, just the good food. Prices have been raised by ~dollar from before, but it's still good enough to get me coming back.

Special Mention: Chinese BBQ!!!
This is really worth mentioning because they make their own barbequed goods. They don't have it on display. Refer to their {Barbecued} menu. A whole BBQ pork is $10. When I first ate their Cha Siu in-house, my first bite was o_o unexpectedly delicious! I think it's cuz I wasn't expecting BBQ made from them. It's sweet marinade, very tender & juicy; once I tried it, I couldn't stop eating it! It was a good balance of meat and fat. I'm sure if you verbally request what cuts you want, they'll get it for you. So the next time your parents or grandparents request for some Chinese BBQ last minute, be sure to give this place a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now.  This time being my last.  Things had to asked for multiple times before we could get anything.  Wasn't brought utensils, was ignored the first time then asked for it 3 times with 3 different servers.  Asked for take out box they went away and never came back, had to be asked several times before getting the box. They didn't look happy to serve us and were only nice to customers who looked like regulars.  Never coming here again. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ duck with noodle, great value for the large plate of duck you get, available after 11am."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner Sunday evening at 5ish and it was almost a full house by 6ish with a crowd lining outside. We ordered the set combo for $68.99 and it comes with soup. I knew it was gonna be a good meal when I had the soup because it was so sweet, tasty, and flavourful. It was tried bak choy soup. The combo also comes with 3lb lobster cooked anyway you want. We choose the maggie style. The lobster was so fresh and the flavour is on point. Like it was so good and flavourful to the point I was eating the shells. Then there was a choice between chicken and bbq pork. Apparently the bbq pork is famous here so we chose that. Man, the sauce. So so so good. You can eat alot of rice with that sauce. It tastes just like the ones in Hong Kong with the perfect amount of sweetness. The pork had a good balance between fatty parts and lean meat. You can request for leaner pork but its gonna be tougher to chew. Then you can choose between sweet and sour pork or some sort od pork chop. We chose sweet and sour pork. I normally dont like sweet and sour pork cuz u never know if youre gonna bite into a piece of fatty pork or not. But all pieces were lean meat and the outer layer was so crisly. Last but not least there was a vegetarian dish with freshly fried tofu mushroom and veggies also very good. At the end we got a hot red bean dessert soup soo good. Rarely do you get all dishes you like in the combo. So ill definitely becoming back.

Lets do a little math here. So the combo was 68.99. 1lb of lobster is 20.85 there. 3lbs would be 60 ish dollars. So basically we got the other 3 dishes for 8 bucks. They sell the bbq pork for 10.50 and sweet and sour pork for 8.99. So basically they gave you like 90 isv dollar worth of food. So worth it. And also very good. Price means nothing if the food isnt great.

Service is alright. Not exactly the cleanist with the most trendy interior. You do smell like oil after dinner because od their poor ventilation."}
{"text":"The food here looks and tastes great. They have a soup special which comes in a huge bowl and imo is worth the price! They also bring lemon tea or milk tea with it for 70c more. Both of which taste pretty good.
And the food came relatively quickly. 
The bathrooms are clean and look pretty nice. 

I don't suggest coming here, unless you are going with a Chinese speaker. Since it seems that the staff is mostly all Chinese speaking with little English. The servers made 2 mistakes but they were minor.  
The place is also very loud, so it depends on how you like your eating environment. 

However if you do know someone that knows Chinese, I would suggest giving this place a try."}
{"text":"The food is very good and the service from the waitresses are also respectable.   However the manager is a DICK.  He's rude and really condescending.   What an ass!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and the waitresses seemed confused with the orders. During my stay, I noticed they were serving the wrong orders to the wrong tables as well... Maybe they need to be a little more organized? Also could not use Visa card to pay the bill, so that was another downside. In terms of food and drinks, everything was average."}
{"text":"Don't really understand why people complain about the service. I have been here for a good 10-12 times for both lunches and dinners in the last few months. The service is decent every time for a busy Chinese restaurant. Some waitresses are even quite friendly and warn you on certain dish selections based on their size and other preferences you tell them. Remember this is not a restaurant inside a 5 star hotel so please have the proper expectation especially on how cheap and good their food are.

This has turned into our favorite spot for family dinners. Food has been very good every time we have been here. Their complimentary soup during dinner times have been excellent every time too. The only downside is cash only! Even though we live in Markham, we will be coming back often for sure."}
{"text":"Food is tasty and flavourful while maintaining a economical price! Great for lunches and afternoon tea snacks!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 3 tables for a 10 course meal. Somehow they made a mistake with someone else's reservation and said we cancelled 'cause the weather was bad...so by the time everyone was there, the food wasn't ready. Luckily the wait for food wasn't too long but the fact that they made a mistake like that is unprofessional. 

For a 10 course meal, it lasted 4 hours. I was there around 12pm and didn't leave until around 4pm...never mind about dinner I was still so full. 

Service and food was good. My only complaint was that majority of the food was  cold. Some were hot, some were half warm/half cold...

I'll come back again though, maybe for breakfast and hopefully their food isn't cold."}
{"text":"The food served before 5:30pm is similar to Leslie Cafe (HK Cafe Style) except the prices are much cheaper than Leslie Cafe. After 5:30pm, food served is similar to congee delight (a few stores to the left). Dinner prices are average and the food is still pretty good.

I recommend coming here before 5:30pm for their amazing prices/food."}
{"text":"This is a typical hk style fast food chain in Toronto, I believe it is the 3rd location after the ?? at Hwy 7 and Chalmers and ?? at 16th opposite of T and The supermarket.  Ordered a duck eggs with slender meat congee but it was really rich and thick, it needs to be watered down.  I also ordered a pineapple bun with slice of butter, but the order came as ???, which was really disappointing.  I asked the server that I this was a wrong order, the server left it on my table, making even more infuriating.  I talked to the man who seems to be the manager or owner, and he quickly took it away and double checked the order.  

The pineapple bun came but no signs of the slice of butter, it was margarine.  The bun was hot, but not as I expected.  Next time I will be less adventurous at this location and order my usual side eggs and breat with beef and macaroni in soup."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Food was 2.5/5 AT BEST. But the service was absolutely GARBAGE. We were a group of 5 and came into an EMPTY restaurant, but was asked to move to a smaller table twice. But what was worse was before we were even done with desserts, they basically told us we need your table 3x - when HALF OF THE RESTAURANT WAS STILL EMPTY. At this point, we got a bit irritated and the manager proceeded to say \"if you aren't happy, don't eat here.\" 

If the food was actually amazing and the line up was long, we wouldn't have mind it as much, but for such mediocre food, I'd say you can probably eat much better bbq and seafood elsewhere."}
{"text":"My family LOVES coming here for their Lobster dinner combo. 

For about $68 you get 2 lobsters, 2 meat dishes, 1 vegetable dish, along with complimentary soup and dessert. The combo is good for 4-6 people depending on how much you eat. For my family, we will usually have to take home some of the meats and veggies as the 4 of us can't finish everything. 

We usually get the lobsters cooked in green onions and ginger and it was so amazing that there's none left to pack up to take home. For the other dishes we like getting the cold salty chicken (+3 extra), pork chop, and mixed vegetables. All of them have large portions and pretty great tasting too! 

The place usually gets pretty busy during weekend dinner time, but it seems they do take reservations. There are many tables that can comfortably fit 6-12 people, so large parties are definitely welcome. 

In terms service the servers are quite efficient at bringing in the food and cleaning up the dirty dishes, and are quite friendly too. It's like your average Chinese restaurant where you can call up anyone to take your orders. 

Would definitely come back again for their hard to resist Lobster Meal!"}
{"text":"Very great place to go with your family for some yummy Chinese dishes. We ordered two combos and it was enough food to make us all full and to take some home as well! Good price for the food quality. The soup that came with our meal was NOT the typical MSG soup that every restaurant gives. It was actually really good and did not leave my mouth dry. We came on a friday night and it was packed! Make sure to RSVP on fridays and weekends. Staff was very attentive and always came to check up on us and to chat with us. Interiors of the place is very bright and golden. Although some people may not like the loud chatter, I feel like this is what makes it family friendly."}
{"text":"I come here for dinner. It's a standard Chinese dim sum dinner place. Food is really good but place looks disorganized. I come here often."}
{"text":"Food was good, however it is clearly understaffed and lacks process/organization amongst the staff.  Some members lacked any sort of soft skills or manners when asked a question.  The food is redeeming it's grades, could easily be much higher should the staff not be so terribly hard to get a hold of and not one moment say we don't take credit, then justify it by saying no credit during busy hrs, then saying oh just pay up front.  Inconsistencies all around from. Back to back visit from service front."}
{"text":"Went with a friend and they were quite friendly.  The menu is you traditional HK style cafe and is well priced.  I had the baked ox tongue with spaghetti in tomato sauce.  It was delicious and helped to fulfill my craving!  My friend had vermicelli soup with pork and preserved vegetables and eggs on toast.  Service was prompt and waitresses chatty (maybe it's because we had babies with us).  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I give this place a four star. The food and the pricing is terrific. I was actually surprised by the customer service. It was unlike any other Chinese restaurant. It was actually very good.
Reason why it lost a star was because they ONLY except cash!!! There are no signs indicating this on the way in & they don't tell you unit the bill arrives.
They do not accept debit or credit card, once again no signage of this. I question how long this restaurant will be around, due to the fact this sounds like they are up to something with a CASH ONLY establishment.
So go in and enjoy the excellent food while the restaurant is still around."}
{"text":"3 things I like and don't like

1. Price: Quite possibly the best bang for your buck Chinese food in North York. You can get anything from eggplant with rice to ho fun noodles for a low price ($8-$10) and the portions are massive, especially for noodle dishes.

2. Variety: Not only can you get staple lunch and dinner dishes, there's also a breakfast menu and tea menu. In addition to all of those, there's also the whole BBQ section and feasts for large groups. You can come here for a relaxing cup of tea, a quick and filling lunch, or a large group gathering.

3. Service: The most disappointing thing about this restaurant. Been here several times and each time it takes at least 5 minutes to get a table, even when the restaurant is not even close to full capacity. Even when you do manage to be seated, they at times ask you to move to a different table a few minutes later for no particular reason at all."}
{"text":"Late Sunday night dinner after the softball game. First time here at Tasty BBQ, this place seemed really busy - must be a local family restaurant. The menu has all the Chinese dishes you can imagine, also affordable prices, and quick service.

Started off with a round of refreshing Tsingtao (light Asian beer!), we paired it with the following comfort food:

1. Signature roasted duck - tasty and juicy meat, also comes with light vinaigrette sauce
2. Lightly battered fish with creamy corn sauce - very crispy fish, must order again or any similar dishes!
3. Seasonal beans with minced pork bits - decent, but I have had better
4. Soft shell crab fried rice - wish there were more soft shell crabs, this one was not worth $9.50
5. Scrambled eggs and beef rice noodles - noodles were a bit bland - it needs more sauce. Rawr.

Dishes were hit and miss. Service during this time didn't seem to be as bad as what other Yelpers were experiencing. Maybe because we were served by the restaurant manager (an older gentleman).

2.5 stars for now."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was terrible. We went on Friday at around 6 pm. The place was only half seated. It took them 3 minutes to give us menu and 10 minutes for someone to come to take our orders. I had to literally raise my voice to get noticed. Ridiculous . 
We ordered lobster combo for 4 for $65. Food was quite tasty and portion was large. Hope they have better service cuz I would like to visit more often."}
{"text":"Was in the area so decided to give this place a try. The staff are all super clumsy and they don't watch their surroundings. One almost bumped into me but that's besides the point. Ordered the BBQ duck noodle, BBQ pork with rice, deep fried chicken wings, Portuguese chicken baked rice, and milk tea. 

The chicken wings were absolutely terrible, tasted like they haven't changed their frying oil in ages. The BBQ pork was below average and I'm pretty sure it wasn't fresh. The BBQ duck on the other hand was the only thing that passed. Portuguese chicken baked rice was nothing special. Milk tea was like any other hk cafe. 

When asking for an extra plate she somehow managed to knock some of our things on the table down. One of my pet peeves is clumsiness and I can't handle having a chance of even getting food or a drink accidentally poured on me. Not coming back and not recommended."}
{"text":"This restaurant is exactly like what you would expect from a HK cafe, but it also has traditional Cantonese dishes. I ordered my favourite - spaghetti bolognese! It was filling, but didn't taste special. Overall, this place is decent for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place is a 2.5 star. This place has the worst service. Chinese places usually do have poor service but this place is so bad. Servers are rude and never smile. They are very slow and takes a while before you can order or get your bill. The prices here are pretty decent tho and food is not bad. The hk milk tea is hot enough and has strong enough tea taste. This is my third time, only reason I come here because its decent price and its close to where i live. They have breakfast specials and afternoon specials. Come here for the cheap food and dont expect anything else."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant every once in a while. Each time I come back the food quality gets worse. The servers are very unprofessional, handing out plates as if we are at a poker table. Servers are completely unaware of where customers are sitting and bumped into me at least 3 times when I was there. So when the food has arrived you can count on the banging of loud plates to ring through your ears while eating here. Food quality was mediocre if not below average. I would pick a different place to eat if you are going for Peking duck or lobster dinner."}
{"text":"A bit surprised as to the low rating for this place. The service was a bit slow yes, and perhaps people are turned off by the restaurant only takes cash? That aside, I found the actual food surprisingly impressive. 

We ordered several balanced dishes: Bok Choy with Steamed Fish, Salt and Pepper Fried Pork, Sweet and Sour Pork, Softshell Crab Fried Rice, and Fried Duck. The fish was fresh and  the bok choy was cooked just right (not under/over-cooked). The Fried pork was nice and crispy, without being excessively oily. The S & S pork was pretty standard, but wasn't overly fatty, like a lot of other Chinese restos. The star of the dinner though, and what this place is apparently most known for, was the softshell crab fried rice - loved the seasoning, and how the crispy crab really livened up the dish. 

I would try this place again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Tasty BBQ Seafood Restaurant's menu does looks really familiar especially if you been to Ocean Seafood Restaurant and Hai Tung Cafe. Apparently they are sister's companies!

Come before 5:30 pm if you want to take advantage of the Hong Kong Style Cafe offerings. The price is amazing! All Day Combo is ridiculously priced from $1.79 to $3.99. You can get a bowl of soup noodle and drink for that price!

????($5.99) Fried Rice Noodle with Beef and Soy Sauce
????????+???+??($6.99) Noodle Combos At Your Choice

Not really amazing but decent.

Service was A-OK. 

Cash only.

Parking could be a nightmare even during a weekday afternoon."}
{"text":"Frustratingly bad service. My standards are already very low for service, as long as two things are met: Somebody exists so that I can get my order down and get it right, which you can do in even the most . 

They somehow screw it up at least one of the two every time. Food isn't bad when you do get it, but be prepared to have a lot of patience for them until then."}
{"text":"The food here is too inconsistent and the servers are really pushy about getting you to upgrade dishes. Also they are rarely there after getting your order and don't clear the tables."}
{"text":"This is the 5th time coming here. We were interested in trying their Peking duck but the first four times they always said they \"ran out\" when we came for dinner around 6-7pm. This time, they had Peking duck. However, we waited 40 minutes for our food to come. The Peking duck seemed less than a full duck? For a table of 5, they gave us only 8 wraps. All the Peking duck dishes came on white plates with seran wrap and the food was cold. Can't give them more than 1 star for food and service. Also the room with the table they sat us in on the second floor smelled like chemicals/paint. Wouldn't come back!"}
{"text":"Best hk cafe food in North York. .. I think :D try the baked meat sauce macaroni during afternoon tea hours, reaaally good. Their fried rice is very soft and fresh. I love their chili oil, its really spicy.

UPDATE: Walked out after 40 minutes today after being blatantly ignored by 2 waitresses and manager. Free soup and tea though. They all acknowledge you when u put your hand up. You put hand down then they go on about their business. Or they say wait a second and not come back. :( heartbroken this happened to my fav hk resto"}
