{"text":"Probably the best Asian Food I've had in Pittsburgh.  My wife and I went there for dinner and the service was great.  I tried the wonton soup and the broth actually had flavor.  My wife had Honey Walnut Chicken and I had the hot plate beef; both were flavorful and extremely well presented.  We had a new server and it was evident that she was well-trained on the menu items.  The menu is pretty interesting and includes traditional fare.  As I understand it, the Sushi Chef is one of the owners and their sushi is pretty good.  We don't do sushi but a couple people who eat it have told me theirs is great also.  You won't get Sweet and sour chicken or pork here but you will get great food and service."}
{"text":"This place is so great! We had the spring rolls...delicious. Hot and sour soup...good. Three S Shrimp...great. Shrimp fried rice...awesome. Fresh food. Cooked to order. Nice service. Good atmosphere. New favorite Chinese food restaurant without question or competition."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the freshness of the food. You could taste the freshness of the fish, very high-quality.  I have the salmon my wife had the mackerel both were cooked just right in the rice pilaf side dish was a favorite of hers.  Sure it was a little bit pricey, but this is a good destination for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Food was good, no question bout that.  Cup was dirty.  Never came to refill my water."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Chinese restaurant that I have been to in Pittsburgh.  The menu selection is huge and I really enjoyed how they had it broken down between traditional and Americanized Chinese dishes.  I ordered the orange chicken as that is my staple at a Chinese restaurant and it was the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Went to eat there 2 days ago. Had a fantastic meal. Learned a lot about celebratory traditions in China done during the Chinese New Year from the staff. Food and service were both excellent. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 or 5 times for lunch and dinner. Very good food every time. Do not come here expecting Gen Tso Chicken or Sweet and Sour Pork. This is not your run of the mill Chinese restaurant. The food is incredible and unique. Highly recommend.  Service has improved dramatically since its opening. I took clients there last Friday. Our meal was perfect."}
{"text":"Amazing! Authentic! The best asain food in pittsburgh. The hot sauce dish is deliciously flavorful and actually spicy, unlike other places, if you order spicy it actually is and also not overpowering of the other flavors. The sushi is also amazing, fresh, and delicious. The homemade noodles are to die for...I can't eat lots me in or noodle soups anywhere else now. The staff are also friendly and patient with people new to authentic seszchuan food - you can trust their recommendations if you aren't sure what to choose. Overall, I would give this place a 10 out of 5 if I could!!"}
{"text":"First time there on a Friday night and will go back. We thought the food was great tasting and will return. We had the Broccoli Classic and Shrimp/scallop Classic.  Large portions of food and good tasting.  Not crowded that night and service was quick. Reasonably priced for the large portions."}
{"text":"As a Chinese I think Jade offers quite authentic Chinese food. It replaces Sichuan Gourmet as my No.1 choice in Chinese restaurant list. Reduce one star because the dishes are a little salty to me. Great place! I definitely recommend my friends to try!"}
{"text":"Love Jade! The fried rice is amazing as well as dishes like Mongolian chicken and tangerine orange style beef. Great Shanghai spring rolls and potstickers for apps.  Been here many, many times and every meal has been fantastic!  Great atmosphere and nice bar as well!  It's a must try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Our local go to for Asian food.  Great sushi, stir fry and decent dumplings.  Friendly staff and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Pros: Nice atmosphere. It's definitely one of the fancier Sichuan restaurant in Pittsburgh. Food is great. There are lots of Asian faces, so you can tell that they serve authentic Sichuan food (if you order from the Chinese menu).   Cons: A little bit pricey, comparing to other Sichuan restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Flavor was good on all dishes. They had a home made hot oil sauce that was awsome.Portions were huge on main dishes and enough to share. My only complaint is that it was very dark in there."}
{"text":"Liking this place more and more every time I go.  Dan Dan noodles,  soup dumplings, and sushi were all very good.  The small plates are reasonably prices and big enough to share.  They have good lunch and happy hour specials.  Really want to work my way through the Chinese menu as there are many items you just cannot find in the South Hills.  I'm sure their Chinese/American menu would also suit the less adventurous crowd."}
{"text":"Great service with recommendations from our server to the manager stopping by and talking to us about popular menu items.    The food was delicious.  Had a specialty sushi roll, Spicy Kani roll.  Nota fan of spicy food but this roll was not spicy.  We also shared the garlic basil chicken.  Very good. I would recommend this place and we will return.  I like that their menu includes a traditional Chinese dish option.   Something different that isn't offered at many other places.    Decor, atmosphere were all very nice."}
{"text":"Loved it! Didn't know it was there and noticed when parking. Lots of gluten free options. Best lo mein around!  The homemade dumplings were also deelish!! Great service too!"}
{"text":"worst taste ever. never order the green peper?never ever?the grill is so bad?some of them are covered with all salt, some with all red pepper without anything else."}
{"text":"The dumplings were amazing, but nothing else I ordered seemed too special. The food was fine, I just expected more for the price and after having the stellar dumplings as an appetizer. The service is what I found lacking. For some reason, the hostess took our main course order, which is fine, but my order was incorrect. (I ordered an entree and was brought out a 1/2 cup bowl of soup) No big deal, I was fine to wait another 10 minutes for my food, but I was shocked that not one of the 4 people that interacted with me about the mishap ever offered any sort of apology (Not the waitress, the hostess, the food busser, or the other person that came out from the kitchen to double check that they got it right the second time, in fact I kinda felt like they tried to convince me that I messed up and I DID actually order a teeny bowl of soup for my entree.) Usually when an order gets screwed up, a good restaurant wont charge you for that item, or they will take one of your drinks off the bill. Not only did that not happen, I wasn't even given a simple apology, so I think they need to work on their customer service standards. Oh, and also, we overheard one waitress say to another \"Im gonna kill someone\" as she was walking away from another table. I understand working in the service industry can make you want to kill people, but really, save that talk for the kitchen."}
{"text":"Let me first say I haven't had the opportunity to dine at the restaurant yet but we've ordered delivery twice and have been thrilled with every entre√© and with delivery times (during dinner and lunch).  Lo Mein and Pad Thai pulled noodles were tasty and the Gong Bao with Tofu was excellent and very spicy!  Portions are nice and big, you can share and have enough for leftovers.  Looking forward to actually eating at the restaurant soon, will post proper review then."}
{"text":"Chinese food, service and environment worth the 5 star. And, you need to pay a 5 star price for these, too."}
{"text":"In love with this place!  One of my favorite Mt. Lebanon eating spots if you're looking for something a little classy.  If you're looking for a great place where you'll 100% be satisfied come here!  You can't beat the reasonable prices and delicious food."}
{"text":"I lived in Columbus, Ohio. Recently I paid a visit to Pitts, and my friend highly recommended this restaurant  to me, so i was really looking forward to go there. On Friday, we drove to Mt. Lebanon Washington Rd and arrived around 5 o'clock when i was pretty hungry at that moment. The environment and decoration there is pretty nice and clean. My friend said the beef noodle soup is her favorite. Then we ordered the noodle soup, sushi, tofu and \"Basil and garlic style Chicken\"(my favorite dish there). I stayed in China for a year before because of my business. I have to say Jade Grille has the real Chinese food and closet Chinese taste compare to other unprofessional Chinese restaurants. The materials they utilized are super fresh, you can tell from the salmon in the sushi. All in all, i was impressed by the food and the nice service!  Definitely will recommend to all the skeptical foodie and hope you will enjoy eating there as i do :)"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time last night. The food was excellent.  The smoked tea duck might be the best duck I've had in a restaurant.  My wife got the tangerine orange steak and that was delicious as well.  Their cocktail list is original.  The service was very good. The setting was nice, lively but not too loud.  We'll definitely be going back. The quality of food, drink, and experience for the price was impressive."}
{"text":"This place is top quality the whole way. We have tried many items from each menu category and it just keeps getting better. Dine in or take out by far the best Asian in the south hills. The steamed dumplings are ABSOLUTELY amazing. Braised chicken noodle soup rocks too. My fav is the chicken pad Thai. Go there, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best Chinese restaurant in the South Hills. Authentic and an eclectic menu. I've eaten here 5 times, and the clientele is shifting.  Today large numbers of Chinese guests and no nonAsians. Not surprising since the cook is from Chendu (near Sichuan) and he seems imprevious to requests. Every time that I have visited with guests, we asked the dishes to be less \"hot\" ie decrease the numbers of red hot peppers and as far as I can tell, the dishes remained \"hot\" and the number of red peppers seemed excessive given our reguest.   The prices are relatively high compared to Red Tea House and Sesame Inn. That said, I love Sichuan food and \"hot\" dishes. Simple Chinese dishes are great including steamed pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, the small soups (eg seafood corn chowder)  and large bowls of noodle soup. And I recommend these dishes for nonAsians - they are delicious and low-priced.  The hand-pulled noodle dishes are exceptional and compare favorably with Everyday Noodles in Squirrel Hill. The wok dishes are the delicious highlight of the restaurant.  I will expand on my review once I have sampled more of them. Service is outstanding."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is in a different league than most Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh and venture to say in the US.  Nice atmosphere, clean, ambiance but most importantly excellent food especially if you like regional Chinese spicy cuisines.  Try the Sichuan wonton, masterpiece, or the handmade dumplings from appetizers.  The ChongQuing spicy chicken is fried with red hot peppers, not dry, juicy and tasty.  My favorite chicken dish is the country style (Hunan)?with jalape√±os, celery if  you like spicy. Overall, excellent Chinese either authentic or Chinese American."}
{"text":"Being a Chinese I want to say this is the most authentic Chinese food I found in Pittsburgh. Their Chef are from Sichuan. They don't cook with those market salty and sweet soy sauces like many the other Chinese restaurants do. All the flavors are natural, house made; ingredients are perfect. Even though they are a little pricely, their food, service and place worth the value you pay. Don't miss their BBQ choices. Ask for the Chinese menu or ask the chef to cook in real Chinese style... you will have the food exactly taste like what you will have in China."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice and the staff are friendly and efficient.  The menu can feel overwhelming but the staff is happy to walk you through, explain the dishes and make recommendations after hearing what YOU like .  Plus, they have some really creative cocktails at the bar--the Basil Pear Martini is lively and lovely--thanks to Christina for her recommendation on that!   Their \"authentic\" food  (which the server always recommends...TAKE THEIR ADVICE!) is absolutely incredible--it has spoiled me for Chinese  food (aka American Chinese) at other places.  They have a great variety of sushi.  I am blown away by their softshell crab roll!  Everything we have tasted has been excellent and we look forward to eating and drinking many more of their fine creations in the future!"}
{"text":"Food is very delicious general tso chicken and chicken lo mein omg yummy  but delivery driver is awful especially to disabled i am a little hard of hearing and the delivery guy yelled at me  over no tip very rude called and reported him , manager was very nice about it i recommend the food but don't get delivery pick it up in person"}
{"text":"I had the basil garlic chicken with white rice and egg drop soup. It was some of the best American style Chinese food I've had in a very long time. It had fresh ingredients and the place was clean."}
{"text":"The service was very good: attentive, efficient & friendly. We really enjoyed our dinners. Dau had chicken lo mein; good noodles with big chunks of tender chicken that was perfectly sauced. Hubby and u split a roll and some pad Thai. I liked the roll; the pad Thai was ok. I loved the seviche the best; quite inventive and nicely spiced."}
{"text":"We ordered from Jade for delivery. I was excited to try it based on all the feedback. We ordered through Yelp with an estimated 45-60 minute wait, which was fine. After an hour and a half, I called and was told our food was out for delivery with no ETA. We didn't get our food until 2 hours later. Needless to say the steamed dumplings and crab rangoons were cold and soggy. The sushi was great, except for the fact we had already eaten assuming the delivery was never going to arrive.   The only reason I am not giving 1 star is that I believe the food would have been good had we gotten it in a timely fashion. We will definitely never be ordering delivery from Jade again."}
{"text":"Jade grille is one of the nicest restaurants in Pittsburgh. Food was great but service was even better. Our waitress Keiko was absolutely fantastic. Everyone else there was very friendly, including Bob, who took time to introduce himself. The curry chicken was one of the best I've ever had.   If you're looking for a night out and don't want to break the bank go check them out."}
{"text":"Fantastic Chinese food and large portions!  The best Chinese food in Pittsburgh!  Garlic Cucumber and calamari for appetizers are my favorite.  Jade Grille Fried Rice and Seafood Eggplant are EXCELLENT!  Comfortable bar area for before or after your meal!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, authentic and American chineanse cuisine. Friendly staff, nice environment."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat their servers are amazing and the food is just out of this world I deafly give it a five star rating just because they deserve it"}
{"text":"I appreciate authentic Chinese cuisine. This evening we got the Long green pepper beef. It was Excellent, Excellent and Excellent! Very flavorful and tender beef. It brings back memories of when I had something similar to this but with Chinese white bread. (Please serve the rolled white bread with this I would love that.) Thanks for the delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best Asian food around. My husband and I lived in China for awhile and this is the first and only place in the Burgh that is genuine. Try the Chili Hot Pot with a Tofu if you like spice. Yum! We are now averaging coming here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi spot! Definitely recommend stopping in to give it a try (especially with the $10 for $20 deal - that originally lured us in, but I'm glad it did)! It's in a good area, decent parking, and shops surrounding/connected. Fun outside of restaurant.  We started off with crab rangoons. They had enough filling, were crispy, and awesome duck sauce.  I ordered the Saigon sunset - really awesome cocktail!! I took a picture of the cocktail menu just so I could recreate that deliciousness at home. If you like cinnamon & tequila - order this and thank me later.  I ordered the lobster tempura roll (only $10), which was simple but delicious. It came with purple rice which added a very subtle sweetness but enhanced the roll in itself.  My friend ordered the volcano roll. That was a lot more of different flavors in a bite, but still yummy - he is more adventurous in the sushi department than myself.  They had Mochi ice cream on the menu, which made us smile, but the waitress said how she loved Mochi and she wasn't a fan of theirs so we opted to head next door to a homemade ice cream shop.  Will definitely be back when in the mood for some sushi!"}
{"text":"First impression is the place is not packed.  Saw 3 wait staffs serving about 4 to 5 tables.  Great menu for HOT Chinese food. Didn't serve great portions to the choice of Sichuan style dry pot that we ordered. In fact there were 5 times more other stuff than chunks of chicken, which serves as the meat element of the main dish.  Size and stomach-stuffing ability is generally not great, excluding sushi, which is sadly about the same everywhere. Sushi was decent, but not as excellent as the price tag would justify, at least for some of the selections. Overall selection of food category is great, very comprehensive. Food is on average 3.5 out of 5 authentic to the corresponding Chinese provincial styles, which is already somewhat of a rare bird in the Pittsburgh area.  In conclusion, try it out for yourself to see if the price+atmosphere justifies the satisfaction. Approximate spending per capita is 30 for first-timers.   PS, parking is a huge hassle."}
{"text":"Very courteous staff and very flavorful food.  Best Asian fare I've had in the area to date."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to go, after the word had spread among all my friends that there was a new Chinese restaurant opened. It was very clean, nice decor, Good service. Well most importantly, we were happy about the Sichuan cuisine there."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here it's just an all around wonderful experience. From the great staff to the relaxed ambiance to the delicious food, there is really nothing bad I can say about Jade Grille. I would highly recommend the hot sauce chicken, handmade dumplings and the string bean dish. They also have some unique cocktails you can't find anywhere else, try the basil berry martini or the samurai! Jade Grille is definitely one of my new favorites in the south hills."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese food in the area. Every time we come the service is excellent and the food, while on the pricier side for Chinese, is absolutely delicious and fresh. The vegetarian hot and sour soup is probably the best I've ever had. I've stuck typically to the Americanized Chinese part of the menu including the jade grille special, chicken and broccoli, and sesame chicken. All of it was excellent and there is always plenty left over to take home."}
{"text":"Poor service worse waitress ever she doesn't know nothing about the restaurant / manager was no interesting of what we ask / I will never come back"}
{"text":"Handed pulled noodles in the suburbs!  I actually prefer them to everyday noodles in squirrel hill.  Very child friendly, also!  Grab a seat near the bank vault.  Our servers have always been very friendly and helpful.  This is our new go-to Chinese restaurant.  I only wish they delivered to Upper St Clair!"}
{"text":"Food was hit and miss.  Sushi was very good.  Crab soup was ok.  Edemamme was, well hard to screw that up.  The Hot Sauce dish was the issue with our meal.  First, I have to say that it was a huge portion.  Enough for three people to share.  The main problem was the flavor and ungodly amour of oil(see picture). Was very salty and had some spice and that was about the entire flavor profile of the dish.  The service was good.  Not too friendly, but prompt and to the point.  Based on the sushi, I would try again."}
{"text":"Have gotten delivery and dined in. All staff including the delivery drivers have been more than polite and courteous. Food has always been fresh and cooked well."}
{"text":"I am Malaysian Chinese and constantly searching for home food comforts. If you want authentic high quality Chinese food in Upscale decor, this is the place to wine and dine. They even have a separate authentic and American Chinese menu in english to suit all taste buds. They also have unpublished Chinese specials only upon request and sometimes its written in Chinese on the board. The servers  has always been attentive and pleasant. The Handmade steam dumpling is to die for and my favourite. The Lamb soup especially in colder weather hits all the spots. Seafood Tofu Claypot is all fresh and in very generous. The duck is well flavoured and a good alternative to the boring chicken, beef, pork you can find anywhere. The sushi is also very good and generous with their portions and the expensive ingredients. I have eaten in Jade Grille 5 times now and love it. If only my husband can take spicy food, I would love to try the rich variety of spicy food in their menu."}
{"text":"I've never went here but I order delivery all the time. So I'm just speaking about the food, portions and price. And all three I think are great. Portions are always big and I have never had a bad meal from them and I'm delivery. Not eat in. I continue to order out, maybe one day I'll eat it. I would recommend this place 100% good quality food."}
{"text":"Sushi/salmon & eel best I ever had. Gogo shrimp delightful with a nice bite Top shelf cocktails,great service from our server/bartender Christina. We'll definitely be back. Don't overlook this place!"}
{"text":"We have ordered pickup and delivery here multiple times over the last few months since we moved closer to the area. The food is always really good, plenty of left overs, never a long wait time. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So there's the good and the bad !  The restaurant - looks chic. The bar area is real nice , the restaurant is huge . The drinks- a lot of beers on offer ! Thumbs up to that! The food- the roasted crispy duck - excellent and the sweet sauce that came with it was fantastic . I generally NEVER ever have anything that is even bit sweet for appetizers or Entrees. Somehow felt like giving the sauce a try with the duck and wow! Perfect combination of sweet and savory ! The woks come with white or brown rice - a $3 upcharge to get fried rice . Really? Such a small portion and it was not rice and egg - real bad . The garlic basil chicken though nice had big chunks of garlic that look like water chestnut !  So there goes the good and the bad :)"}
{"text":"Our family's favorite spot for Chinese food in the Pgh area.  Favorites include the crispy mala tofu, Chinese long peppers with beef or pork, and the handmade soup dumplings and pot stickers.  Definitely gravitate toward the authentic Chinese menu.  Service is always friendly and efficient.  Steer clear of the sushi--husband was reminded why he only eats sushi at Japanese places after reading a review and trying the sushi here.  Nothing horrible, just not the greatest.  Stick with the Chinese menu, which is terrific."}
{"text":"After a few takeout orders and one dine-in experience, Jade Grille has become one of my and my husband's favorite restaurants for Chinese food. They also have sushi, but we love the Chinese food so much, we've never tried the sushi. One of my favorite things about Jade Grille is that they have an  authentic menu and an American menu. We've tried from both menus and nothing has ever failed us. When ordering takeout, I usually just order straight from the Yelp app which is super convenient. However, the space in the restaurant is actually quite nice for dining in, which isn't typically true for most authentic Chinese restaurants. I highly recommend Jade Grille for authentic Chinese food in the south hills!"}
{"text":"I ordered eggplant with garlic sauce and shrimp with a side of fried rice...It was an ok meal however, I ordered through eat24 and it took an hour and 40 mins for delivery so by the time I received it, I wasnt hungry. The rice was slightly overcooked and the eggplant was very mushy. The best part of the order was the shrimp and sauce. I will probably eat in next time and not order eggplant."}
{"text":"I've never used YELP for food delivery but I was visiting at a nearby hotel, starving and craved Chinese food.  I brought up my YELP and found Jade Grille to my completely gratitude as it was great comfort food delivered to my hotel room.    Plan accordingly as it said my take out would take 45-60 min and it did.  For some reason my room # didn't show-up when I did my order so the driver was great to call to confirm.  They did forget to give me eating utensils and napkins!  (thank goodness hotel gave me those when I went downstairs).  As for the food, very good!  I wanted carbs so the Japchae was great!  And I started with the sui mai dumplings - those were delicious.  You'll see that the prices were a bit pricey but they didn't charge for delivery and the online ordering was a breeze using YELP.  I'm really glad I discovered this feature in YELP!  Found me a great place to eat again when I'm back!"}
{"text":"This place has great noodles and dumplings. That's the good part. Pretty much everything else I've ordered here has been disappointing. I just had the very large assorted sashimi. About half the fish tasted off. If you find yourself here, stick to the noodles."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at this place. I ordered the spicy tofu pot and it was definitely on the spicy side. I like spicy, but the waitress warned me that it is very spicy for even people that like spicy. She was right, it was even when she tapered down the spice to a six. It was still delicious and very flavorful.  It cleared my nasal passages for sure!   The service was friendly and they validated our parking."}
{"text":"Very good quality American Chinese, Authentic Chinese Food and Sushi. Everything I've tried here over the numerous times has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, friendly employees.  Huge menu of both chinese and sushi items. Yes it's expensive, but at least the quality is good.   The yelp deal made it worth it."}
{"text":"Park in the garage and walk the block...will save you a headache!  There are a variety of goodies on this menu that will satisfy your appetite.   I am a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Eat here.  The steamed dumplings (xiaolongbao) are just as good as ones I've had in Shanghai. I could eat these all day (and might)."}
{"text":"Very good and friendly service. Sushi and main meals were excellent, very clean place. We'll be back."}
{"text":"A friend came to visit from out of town and we decided to explore Washington Rd. together. Jade Grille was a place I had been wanting to try, especially because I was intrigued by the idea of eating more traditional, authentic Chinese cuisine. My friend wanted sushi, and so we felt this was the best of both worlds because we could try a little of everything.  We first ordered a small plate of the Handmade Steamed Dumplings, which were just a little bit bigger then a silver dollar. The six dumplings arrived nestled in a steam basket, and we enjoyed the presentation. They were delicious, but as a first taste, I didn't find them terribly exotic, just solidly good.  The second item we ordered was the Sashimi Ceviche, at my insistence, since I'd heard great things about it. This dish blew our tastebuds out of the water, and my mouth is salivating just thinking about it again. It's built like a salad, with large chunks of raw tuna, salmon and yellowtail tossed with chopped red onions, sweet jalapenos, cilantro and chunks of cherry tomatoes in a lime juice and ponzu soy sauce dressing. Ponzu is a citrus-based sauce made with rice wine, rice vinegar, bonito fish flakes, and seaweed, and then I suspect Jade Grille tosses in a bit of soy sauce to make it richer. The ceviche was bright and fresh. The sashimi pieces were buttery and we ended up pouring the remainder of the dressing on our plates to soak up as much of the flavors as possible.  For our third course we had decided to split the Spicy Chili Pot with Chicken, a \"traditional Chinese herb and spices sauce with black mushrooms, bamboo, celery, bell pepper, onion and Sichuan peppercorns.\" It was a smart decision on our part, because the serving that arrived with a side of white rice fed both of us with enough leftover for another lunch and dinner. Our first bite made our eyes bug out slightly, because the dish was *genuinely* hot! The vegetables were crunchy and the flavor was rich and very well-made. We both like spicy foods, so it was a good heat that made us happy.  Lastly, we ordered three sushi rolls - an eel avocado roll, a spicy tuna roll and one of their specialty rolls, the Samurai Roll. First off, let me say that just like the ceviche, all three rolls were very high quality. They were slightly cooler than room temperature and very fresh and for someone who suffers with grocery store sushi far too often, it was a delight to experience the real deal. We found that the best roll was actually the spicy tuna, mainly in terms of flavor. The samurai roll was delicious but very mild, almost to the point of blandness, and needed to be dipped in soy sauce to get the full flavor impact. But the texture was great and the black tobiko, which are egg roe, created a lovely sensation when they bumped across our tongues.  All in all, this was a spectacular dinner. We almost rolled home we were so full, and everything was very well made, well presented, and of a high quality. I nabbed a menu on my way out of the door, because what really surprised me about this high-end Chinese restaurant is that they deliver!"}
{"text":"The dry chili pot was excellent.  Different type of food than most Chinese restaurants in the area.  Stopped in for lunch and was really surprised by the food."}
{"text":"I've given Jade Grille a couple more chances to improve my estimation of them, but they disappointed every time.  The service was okay, but the food is bland and completely unremarkable."}
{"text":"Went to Jade grill on New Year's Eve, the food was great.  Being from Mt Lebo I can't believe I don't come here more often. Also, this place has the best bar in Mt Lebo.  Trust me worth the visit."}
{"text":"It just happened to be a coincidence that the section of the street that this restaurant is on was closed this past Saturday due to a street party.  It was hard to get to the restaurant but I had parked on a block behind Washington.    We were greeted and seated very quickly and we had to go over the menu a few times because there were a lot of choices to make between appetizers, sushi, noodles, hot pots etc.  The menu has a really nice variety of Asian dishes and it was hard to choose from them but we did eventually make our choice.    They had a good choice of beers on tap and even had a variety of special sake.  We had started with the garlic and basil deep fried wings and the steamed dumplings which didn't take that long to come out.  The wings were cooked properly, through and through.  The sauce and spice were very good.  I can't say I've had wings like this before, saucy yet crunchy but the sauce along with the basil was such a unique taste.    The steamed dumplings were as expected but the meat had a very good taste.  Again, perfectly cooked... chewy outside and not soggy at all.  The appetizers were wonderful.  Our server had asked us if we wanted the sushi ahead of the pots and I had said yes.    I had ordered 2 rolls... a twin dragon roll and a crazy gaga roll.  If I recall correctly the twin dragon had both lobster and shrimp and the gaga was a spicy tuna with salmon and jalepeno on top.  The quality of the rolls, fish and construction was great.  As far as rolls go these were both well done.    Lastly we had ordered two hot pots.  The menu is full of a variety of hot pots (a dozen or more) some of which have a choice of which meat you would like from chicken, beef, seafood or veal.  I had ordered the hot sauce beef and my wife had ordered the Hawaii Five 0 which is a mixed seafood pot.  Each pot gave us a choice of rice (white, brown and another I can't remember).    TIP:  Each pot is enough to feed 2 to 3 people but each is only served with a single serving rice.  The pots are absolutely huge. If I had known how large the serving was I would have just ordered one to share instead of two.  Great if you want to take it out afterwards.  The food at Jade Grille was superb.  I've had my fair share of Asian food from many Asian restaurants and I have to say this place served a good variety of tasty food.    Overall the experience was top notch.  The server was very helpful and attentive.  The ambiance was good with the nice soft lighting, good tunes and great food.    I would definitely return to the Jade Grille the next time we return to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I have never been to the actual restaurant, but Jade Grille is my go-to place for consistently great food and delivery.  Never ever have had a problem.  Would like a miso soup option, solely because my 11 year old son loves miso.  But we can live without it.  Again, consistently great food, broad spectrum of authentic Chinese and Chinese-American options, some sushi.... fast delivery. Jade Grille is our family standard when we crave Asian and don't want to leave the house."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had dinner in the restaurant twice, ordered delivery once (not my choice), and all of these experiences with the food was not satisfactory. The fried items were burnt, the satay items were dry without sauces to assist. Even worse... the everyday Crab Rangoon app... how hard is this... was fishy and came with no sauce."}
{"text":"This place is worth the drive from the city. Parking can be an issue on 19 because there are a fair amount of shops on the street near the restaurant.  The food was great. Service was friendly and fast.   They have a bar but it was more a family style restaurant that it was a bar.   The vault private room is a neat bonus for a private party.  Worth a visit. FYI they also have a menu in ??"}
{"text":"I really like this place!  I've only been here twice, but each time was very good.  We were greeted and seated quickly.  The servers were very good.  FOOD:  The menu is quite vast.  There are interesting starters, \"American Style\" Asian food, and \"Authentic Chinese\" dishes.  This is not your cookie-cutter Chinese menu.  I can recommend the Vegetarian Hot and Sour Soup, the Red Curry dish, and the Beef and Asparagus dish.  The Tangerine Beef I had was very good, but was more like a General Tso's dish - different than I expected, but still very tasty."}
{"text":"New favorite Chinese delivery!!!! We had beef xinjlang spice noodles, and the combo fried rice, both of which were great, and very fresh! My favorites were definitely the pork and shrimp shumai, and the handmade dumplings! I got sashimi too, which is always questionable when it comes to delivery, but it was all very good too. We plan to go to the restaurant to dine. As far as delivery goes, we'll be working our way through the whole menu!"}
{"text":"Some best Chinese cuisine you can find in Pittsburgh! Great decoration! Love the room with a door that looks like the kind that you may find in bank vaults."}
{"text":"Tangy fish is my favorite here. Large amount, good to share with friends. Xinjiang noodles was tasty, dry hot pot was ok. Their stuff are very friendly and fast. Moderate decorated compare to a lot of Chinese restaurant. I'm not sure if the other Chinese restaurants just don't care about service and decorations or some other reason that they might have that I am not sure about. Usually they are minimum decorated. But not this place, this place was turned into a restaurant from a bank. They use the safe room to host large parties. An interesting point I think is that they kept the safe door. I would go back there and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I must say, I wasn't too overly impressed with it. The quality of the food here is about average, but the prices are more expensive than most Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. I've had their wok menu items, veggies, skewer items, and mapo tofu ... I would say the best item I found to be was the mapo tofu, which was perfectly soft and was not too overpowering. Really liked the spiciness of the dish as it was on a level higher than what other competitors in the local area had it and was reflective of the Szechuan nature of the dish (really spicy). In short, it seems to be more of a place catered to American tastes than to those looking for authentic Szechuan cuisine although I will say ... they do have a Chinese menu now for those who are looking for more authentic Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Try the sweet peppers appetizer.  Best restaurant in my. Leno by far.  Great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Loved the Sichuan style appetizers. Had a fantastic meal there! :) Best Sichuan (Chinese) restaurant in the Pitt area."}
{"text":"Maybe by Pittsburgh standard it is one of the better Chinese restaurants in town (and I sincerely hope not), but if you want REAL, AUTHENTIC Chinese food, you won't find it here. The items on the menu almost could fool you into thinking it's authentic, but sadly it's not.  Ordered the boiling fish and it's consisted of dried chili pepper, fish fillet in an extremely bland/tasteless broth, covered by half an inch of bland vegetable oil."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant in the heart of Mt. Lebanon! Tried this place for the first time this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised.   We started with the handmade steamed dumplings and they were delicious. I ordered the stuffed eggplant with beef and it was by far one of the best asian dishes I have ever had. My date had the tea tree mushroom w. chicken clay pot which was equally delicious. We finished out our meal with the cheesecake sampler dessert and a cup of their green tea (Tea Forte).   Will definitely return to try more of the authentic asian dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"The food was good, the ambiance was good, it just took forever to get anything! Our waitress was covering a set of tables for someone else and it made service slow. I however would like to re-try this restaurant at some point."}
{"text":"(Should be a 2.5)... So overpriced. Just ordered take out from here, and the portions are very small. The sushi (King Kong Roll) was okay. The Gong Bao, was about two fist fulls for size, the taste was good, and spicy. It was what was expected, just small.   The Shanghai Spring Rolls were mostly breading. Disappointed. We used a yelp deal and still felt it was overpriced."}
{"text":"I visited when this place first opened up. The skewers were good, so were the sushi. But I'm not particularly impressed by any other dishes. Also the portions are on the smaller side. The interior is nice though."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and authentic Chinese. Not general tso, real dishes people! Great owners, Justin and Andy and great bartender Nolan. You must go and try it out. Great specials during the week 5-7pm, food and alcohol. Beautiful bar, awesome tvs if you want to eat and watch a game. You shouldn't miss this gem in Lebo. Delivery is available and awesome too!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a few friends a couple nights ago (used the $10 for $20 deal here on Yelp!). We started with the sashimi platter (4 pieces of 5 (?) fish - we got salmon, tuna, sea bass, yellowtail, and white tuna) which was really good, especially by Pittsburgh standards. Buttery, thick slices of seemingly fresh fish :) Everyone also really enjoyed their meals - I got the red curry, which was amazing, and, after eating (more than) my fill, the leftovers lasted me another two meals.   Others got the mapao tofu, red curry (again), and a spicy chicken pot thing (not sure of the exact name, sorry!) - everyone loved their meals. We split a couple bottles of the house unfiltered sake, which was also pretty delicious and went down really easily. Definitely a little pricier than standard Chinese fare, but I'd say it was definitely worth it for the size and quality!"}
{"text":"Food is so very good! #nomnomnom The kids chicken fingers are more like popcorn chicken and our picky son still eats them! The Sichuan dry rub wings are spicy and better than some wing places. Have only begun to investigate the menu. Had a few if the Thai items which are good - red curry chicken and the Pad - both really good."}
{"text":"Wonderfully fresh fish flown in Daily. Delicious flavors simple and lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and man was I happy. It's been 7 hours since I've been there and I'm still thinking about it. My mouth wants more of this food!   My brother and I split a little plate of  sliced beef Sichuan style and the more we ate the more we wanted.   For the main lunch I had chongqing spicy chicken.  Imagine crispy chicken skin with spicy Chinese spices. Couldn't stop eating it!  My brother had the spices hot pot with chicken.  The chicken was so tender, the veggies compliment and took on the flavor of the sauce and didn't overpower the food the way that some veggies can (especially carrots)  Lunches came with rice and soup which were both excellent.  Took back a braised chicken noodle soup and reports were also very positive   Price might seem a bit high but it was worth it for the quality.   Lunch crowd was surprisingly small. Don't let that dissuade you if you come for lunch.   Can't wait to go back. Might even go tomorrow with a coworker!"}
{"text":"Wanted a bite to eat during an afternoon at the library, noticed the Yelp Deal, and decided to come here with my mom. My mom is Chinese and she thought the Ruby Fish Fillet was well done, very light and tasty, and a great deal at the lunch special price with free soup or salad. We also got the Pad Thai, which was okay but a little disappointing in comparison. It had the basic components of a Pad Thai and a good portion size, but wasn't something I'd choose again. The atmosphere was nice and relaxing and the service was fine. If I'm in the area again, I would definitely consider coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery one Saturday night through Yelp Eat 24. Our food was delivered really quickly, and it was delicious!  I've never had Jade Grille before, and they didn't disappoint. Now I look forward to eating in their restaurant too!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food loaded with flavor! The atmosphere is fabulous! There is a huge bar on one half of the restaurant separated from the general dining area. In the back of the restaurant there is an opened kitchen where you can actually see your meal being cooked. Very fresh sushi and a wonderful wine list!"}
{"text":"I would say it's a even better place compared with HaoLee. The cook from Chengdu my hometown really masters the essence of Szechuan dishes. The flavor of the food was so good that made one of my friends kind of homesick. And for me the food definitely qualifies the level of excellence. I haven't trie other styles of food so I cannot comment with that. But the design of the restaurant itself is so decent and the idea of opening up that bar area is actually nice. A word of advice would be to start serving cold dishes at the bar for the beer. In general this restaurant is fantastic especially for those enjoying Chinese style hot/spicy food!"}
{"text":"When I first saw that the Jade Grille was opening in my home town, I have to say I was a little skeptical.  I thought that by the look of the front and the font of the sign that this was a lower class general asian cuisine restaurant.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I went in on a Sunday evening and was lucky enough to notice the buy one skewer or sushi roll get one half off promotion.  I believe it goes from 4 or 4:30 to 6:30ish but I could be mistaken.  My mother and I decided to try it.  The inside was lovely and clean and the hostess and bartender (as we sat at the bar for the promotion) were both very friendly.    We ordered two soups, two skewers, and two sushi rolls.  My mother thoroughly enjoyed the Seafood Hot & Sour soup and I ordered the Crab Asparagus soup which was delightful.  Often you find with crab or lobster soups that you can hardly taste the meat or that there's very little meat to begin with but this was not the case in my experience.  It was hot and had a perfect amount of sliced asparagus and crab meat and both flavors were very prevalent.  The skewers we ordered were the bacon covered quail eggs and the fish with miso and kabakayi sauce.  The fish was good and we finished the piece very quickly but quail eggs are my personal favorite.  I would recommend these soft boiled bacon wrapped balls of heaven to anyone!  I believe the two sushi rolls we ordered were the Crazy Gaga Roll and the Jade Roll though I could be wrong as they don't have descriptions on the website.  They were both good; one was wrapped with a thin crepe ad the other was topped with jalape√±o slices.  The jalape√±o one had fish and avocado on top and, although it was very tasty, the avocado had turned brown already and wasn't as appealing to look at.  Without drinks and with what we ordered, our total came to about $50 before the promotion was added which got us to about $35 after tax.  So while it was tasty and the atmosphere was nice, it was still a bit pricey.  I certainly won't be buying drinks with my meals at least.  But overall I was well fed and very happy with my first experience with the Jade Grille."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from Jade Grill for about a year.  Perhaps 7 or 8 times. Unfortunately, what started out as a good choice for Chinese food in Lebo is no longer the case.  The quality has gone downhill and our meal tonight was disappointing. The Mongolian style chicken was bland, the Xinjiang spice noodles hopelessly overcooked , and eggplant dishes from recent orders overripe and bitter."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. The first time the sushi was ok, but the service was poor. Tried it again and was even more disappointed. It took two hours because they were busy. The sushi was warm. It tasted old, fishy, and we were afraid to eat it.  It was a waste of money. I don't think I'd go back. I've had better sushi at other places around here. They seem to try to act trendy, but the food and service is sub par."}
{"text":"What a beautifully decorated restaurant! This is a great place if you are a vegetarian. There is so many options, what a surprise!! The pad thai, tofu dry pot and dry saut√©ed string bean dish are all incredible. I was also pleased with the wonderful service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I so would. Pittsburgh is limited on good Chinese food, especially in the south hills. We found this place interesting since they did offer some authentic Chinese food so we decided to check it out.   The establishment is well decorated and has a good atmosphere. As soon as we walked in, we were welcomed by the hostess. She sat us on a small table for two and gave us a menu in Chinese. (We can't read Chinese). So we asked for an English Menu. We were craving for duck so we got their braised duck and a dish of eggplant. We waited for about 45 minutes before our meal came, which we can understand if they are preparing the duck fresh but that's still a long time.  When the dishes came, the dishes did not fit on the tiny table (there were plenty of other bigger tables opened when we came in). So we had to move everything to a bigger table.  To our disappointment,  the duck had parts that were extremely burned to the point that you couldn't even bite it. Keep in mind that the portion was extremely little for half a duck (It must have been a duckling). The eggplant was too flavorful for me and definitely not worth the price that they charge. I was not happy with the food at all and will never go back."}
{"text":"We love it here. It's very nice and clean. I like the different options than other Chinese restaurants. The Go Go shrimp was awesome. We had the Shanghai spring rolls which were also delicious. The kids lo mein was a huge portion and also delicious. I had the garlic chicken and broccoli. It was spicy and not too heavy. We highly recommend this place. Also, service is very quick."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good! We ordered the silk tofu with fish, lamb BBQ and spicy beef tendon. The spicy beef tendon is a bit salty, not recommended ! The lamb BBQ is worth trying. There are not many people here even on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Swung by here for lunch on a Saturday.  We were seated and serviced quickly in the mostly empty restaurant, and service was attentive and super efficient throughout the whole meal.  My S.O. and I ordered the SPICES CHILI POT with vegetables, the DOUBLE COOKED pork, and the CUMIN STYLE lamb.  Each dish came with a choice of egg drop or hot and sour soup or a salad and a bowl of rice.  I appreciated the choice of brown rice, which most traditional Chinese restaurants don't provide.  Portion sizes for our dishes were on the small side, even for lunch portions.  Although all three plates were decent enough, we found the flavor to be a bit off for each.  The double cooked pork was both our favorites by far, though I would have appreciated much more black bean flavor than was added--I felt that the pork was pretty bland on its own (besides its intrinsic porkiness) and wasn't able to absorb much of the flavor at all.  My fiancee is a pork belly slut and therefore had no complaints.    The spices chili pot was rather lacking in spices--namely, chilis for heat and Sichuan pepper, which was largely absent in the dish.  I definitely appreciated, however, that they accommodated my vegetable-only order of the dish, which isn't a choice on the menu.    The cumin style lamb was the biggest disappointment.  My fiancee complained that the lamb itself was lacking its distinct grassy lambiness (\"This could be beef, and I wouldn't know the difference.\"), and I complained that it just didn't taste as the traditional dish ought to--the flavor was all cumin and nothing else--no coriander, no pepper (black, white, or Sichuan), no sesame, no soy...just...straight up...cumin, overwhelmingly so.  The name of the dish shouldn't be taken so literally.  The meal was worth it with the great Yelp deal, but unless I find myself in the neighborhood, I won't be back.  Sichuan Gourmet is too much more convenient to us in the city and too much tastier and authentic."}
{"text":"This is usually my go to place; but, tonight's service was terrible.  Food arrived 30 minutes late and was over cooked and dry."}
{"text":"Who knew: outstanding, authentic Szechuan food in Mt. Lebanon. Stick to the \"real Chinese\" part of the menu and you'll get fresh, delicious, deep-flavored food. Our favorite was the fish hot pot. The steamed buns (soup dumplings) were also excellent. Much of it is spicy but not unmanageable. One of the most authentic and best \"ethnic\" food experiences in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"First visit to Jade Grill. It was pretty typical Asian fare.   We got sushi to start out. It was good. We got the black and gold roll. It was tasty. We also got another roll. I believe it was spicy tuna w salmon on top. Good but too much texture for my taste. It was my boyfriends pick.   For dinner I had the kabob salad. Very nice size but the menu said it came with feta cheese and it had blue cheese on it. I'm not a huge blue cheese fan but it was still good.   My boyfriend got the spicy beef and peppers. The beef was a little gristly and it had a ginger flavor that was a bit overpowering.   Overall I would return again. I'd like to try a chicken dish. The presentations and portions sizes were good. I would have rated the restaurant a 3 and a half but couldn't figure out how to do a half star. Not bad to try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We were in town for work we walked into the restaurant way before close. We were seated then told by a lady that came out that they were closed. Their sign clearly stated 9:30 close. Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good but the service is horrible. Its always really slow and if we make a special request like leaving an item off a dish they always forget. Last time we were in the server didn't know about any details of items on the menu and didn't care enough to go ask someone who did know. Its a little over priced so be sure to her the yelp deal."}
{"text":"First off, they won't honor a Yelp certificate for delivery... which doesn't make sense and isn't listed as a restriction. In fact, Yelp even said that the store can't add that restriction at the time of redemption. Needlesstosay, Yelp refunded the money.   Albeit frustrated, I gave this place a try on another night during my work trip this week.   Long story short- they don't know what kimchi sauce is. Their ponzu is DEFINITELY not ponzu. Their salmon roll smells atrocious and can't possibly be fresh (literally smelled of rotting fish). Their handmade dumplings were loaded with some watery liquid that appears to be a result of freezing them. Their hot and sour soup was pure salt, and they didn't put any chopsticks in my to-go order... so I had to use my fingers in my hotel room.   There's had got to be a better sushi place around here... don't waste your time if you want a fresh, true, and safe-bet."}
{"text":"I had the lamb salad at 15.00.... it was mostly lettuce. It was good. But it's mostly greens. Not worth 15.00... take 1/4 lettuce out and go easier on the dressing. It was too satuated. Add more tomatoes, after a side at 15.00 or drop it to 12.00. Our waitress was very nice, efficient and deserved every penny of my 25 percent tip. The place was quite empty for prime time.  The atmosphere was nice. Clean."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Chinese, this is the place to go. It's head & shoulders above the sesame inn and bean curd. It was very good. A big bonus is they deliver. They are in Mt. Lebanon. It's the real deal. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"It was good finding. I've never realized there is a good Chinese restaurant in this location. Food was good. Atmosphere was clean and beautiful. And also staff was very kind and friendly.  I love to go back again. Also, you can use Samsung pay here. I think I was the first case to use Samsung pay. So staff didn't know Samsung pay works here but as most of you know Samsung pay works for almost everywhere.  I think they may remember if I want to use Samsung pay again next time. :)"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite spot in Pittsburgh! The atmosphere is amazing, the food is superb. I'm a sushi snob and here is amazing. The sashimi melts in your mouth like butter and is always ultimate fresh. I've tried most of their menu and every single item is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Food was great for its class and service was really a five star.   They have a Chinese menu and an Americanized Chinese menu.  Wifey and i shared a dry pot. It is beef with lots of spices. It was very spicy and hot but it was the point, delicious.  Service was spectacular for this type of restaurant. It is not a fine dining place so do not expect a romantic dining experience. It is more like a Chinese restaurant trimmed for Americans. Anyway, our server, Marlene, (yes we asked her name) was one of the best servers we had at a $$ restaurant in the US. She answered our questions, helped us finding what we were looking for at the menu and explained what we should expect from our meal. Regularly checked how we were doing. She made our dining experience better."}
{"text":"Perfect romantic restaurant to share some pot stickers or sushi. The entr√©es are so delicious it's always hard to narrow my choice down. I get something different every time and I'm always impressed."}
{"text":"Great beer. Friendly staff. Now even thought the menu might be confusing, the owner/chef is Chinese. And he has some very good authentic Chinese dishes here. Overall it's a great place with a nice bar."}
{"text":"This was my first visit so I was worried, if I would be disappointed. but I must say that food was super good and impressive, I just wish that our server could have mention us that the food comes in a big portion so it would be too much for two people, Other than that everything was great.  So keep in mind before ordering ask for portions."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend takeout. Food was great! Try the Lo mein! But terrible service."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with my husband and friends and we all had a really good time, food was amazing.   Starting with the ceviche. The portion is very generous, you'll even be able to share if this is your appetizer.   If you love lobster and avocado you MUST order the Napoleon. Believe me, you'll thank me forever.   Sushi - awesome, nice size rolls.   Delivery - I always order from them and they are super fast.   Overall experience: great, we all loved it, I'm definitely going back many times!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the authenticity of the food, but the taste was pretty great. I got the tangerine orange steak. I'm not so great at describing flavors, but this was savory with a hint of sweetness. It was a smidge too thick but that's my only complaint. I really hadn't ever tasted a dish like this before, but I would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"Great meal. Very authentic Chinese - best I've had since my last visit to China. The Sichaun Dumpling are worth the visit on their own. Service very helpful and attentive as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat since moving to Mt. Lebanon in August. Justin and his staff are always professional and the food is always perfect. The meat in their dishes are high quality and their chicken is always white meat with no msg.  Their sushi is incredible, filing, and unique.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"My husband is a Chinese native and has always complained when in town visiting that Mt. Lebanon/South Hills does not have any real Chinese restaurants. Jade Grille is as real and authentic as it gets. Their soup dumplings are just like the ones we have when visiting China. So good! We try and make it to Jade Grille every chance we get."}
{"text":"They're delicious, and the sushi is awesome.  I love how affordable everything is without effect if quality."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a while and was finally able to have dinner here last night.  As a small plate, I ordered the mini pork dumplings.  I had read positive reviews about their dumplings so wanted to try them for myself.  Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan.  When you bit in to them or cut them a soupy substance leaked through...perhaps they're meant to be that way but the texture didn't sit well with me.  I also thought the soy ginger sauce they provided with the dumplings was too vinegary.  For my main entree, I ordered the Garlic Basil Wok with Chicken and brown rice.  This dish was very flavorful and there was plenty of chicken morsels (not too big) that were tender and fresh.  You could see garlic gloves and basil leaves throughout the dish.  My only wish for the dish would have been to have some veggies - but it didn't mention that the dish had veggies, so I can't really be upset about that.    My friend had the avocado lobster salad small plate and said it was great and tried the fried rice and was equally satisfied.    I'll definitely be back again to check out their other options.  The decor is very modern and the restaurant itself seems quite spacious.  Love the bank door for the private room."}
{"text":"We are always on the hunt for something spicy and the \"spices pot\" completely hit the spot. Unique, authentic favors and fast delivery too!"}
{"text":"They deliver! This place is as good as it gets for delivery for certain.  I sampled five items from the menu, and it made 5 portions of food for me.  Hot spices chili pot wok with frog legs, cumin style wok with lamb, salt & pepper style wok with soft shell crab, jade spring roll appetizer, and dry sauteed triple green w/garlic (asparagus, snap peas, string beans).  The soft shell crab was cooked well as a battered and fried dish in the salt & pepper style and was my favorite because the seasonings were tasty and not too spicey and because it was done perfectly.  The frog legs were great!  The spices chili pot preparation was spicey, too spicey for me, but the taste made it so worth it.  I'll be ordering this preparation again but with veggies, beef, or shrimp for my next round.  The cumin style and the lamb were both great and a good pairing that I'll have again.  The dry sauteed veggies were a true highlight.  I'm glad I followed the recommendation of another Yelp post to get some veggies."}
{"text":"Over the past few months the Mapo Tofu has changed and almost completely lost flavor. Not sure if they changed their recipe or have new cooks, but it's not the dish I remember."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese. Soup dumplings are to die for and the atmosphere is modern and sleek. Nice bar too, although the bartenders can be a bit clueless about how to mix the most basic of drinks, which is a little confusing. The sushi isn't as good as what you can get down the street at Little Tokyo, but some of the specialty rolls are fun and tasty."}
{"text":"Jade Grille has great-tasting, authentic Szechuan dishes for reasonable prices (especially for lunch).   I've been to Jade Grille a few times and always enjoyed my experience. The restaurant itself is located in an old bank in Mt. Lebanon. While a little atypical for a restaurant, it provides a unique atmosphere and is upscale enough for a nice dinner. The service staff have always been helpful and quick, no complaints there.  The food. Part of the reason I love Jade Grille is because it doesn't just offer americanized-chinese food like General Tso's or Orange Chicken like so many other places in Pittsburgh. They have an expansive, authentic Szechuan menu to select from and the food is delicious.  Some dishes that stand out above the rest. Their Spicy Cucumber is one of my favorites. It's a lightly pickled, mildly spicy bowl of cucumbers that offer a crisp and flavorful introduction to your meal. I order them almost every time I visit. Another favorite is their Spices Chili Pot. I typically order it with chicken. It's a mix of vegetables, chicken and spices served with a side of rice. Szechuan flavors really come through on this dish and it provides a nice kick thanks to the use of Szechuan peppercorns.   I have also enjoyed their Spicy Cold Noodle and Xinjiang Cumin Spicy Noodles. Complete opposites but they go together very well. The Spicy Cold Noodle is a chilled and tossed with a spicy, chili oil that, while messy, offers a nice balance to the cold noodles. The Xinjiang Noodles are spicy and come with a ground meat (either Lamb or Beef) mixed in. While I really enjoy the flavors from both of these dishes, the noodles they use are not the best. It looks and tastes very similar to spaghetti pasta and doesn't offer much in terms of flavor or texture. That being said, the other flavors throughout the dish overshadow the lackluster noodles and keep me coming back for more.  Portion sizes here are generous. I've never been able to finish my entree and have always had food to take home. This makes the higher dinner price point easier to understand. The quality of the food and portion sizer worth paying a little extra for. Speaking of price, go for lunch! They serve the same menu and offer a free salad with their lunch specials and you can get dishes such as the Chili Hot Pot (normally around $15) for only $8. It's a steal!  They also offer takeout and a full service bar. I have ordered take-out once or twice and found it to be just as good as ordering in the restaurant.   TLDR: Great authentic Szechuan cuisine, go for lunch, order Spices Chili Pot and Spicy Cucumber."}
{"text":"Take a trip to Mt Lebanon and stop in at the most amazing, authentic and visually appealing Chinese Food Experience that you will ever enjoy.  Jade Grill has brought Authentic Chinese Dishes to Pittsburgh.  You won't fine General Tso or Hunan Beef...what you will find is appetizers such as Pickled Vegetables, Lamb & Chicken Skewers, Hand Made (at time of order) Steamed Dumplings and much more.  For meals, you can choose from Soups that include 40 feet of hand pulled noodles (and if you don't believe it, ask to watch), Entrees that can include, Beef, Chicken, Lamb, Shrimp or Seafood.  And so much more.  I opted for the Dry Pot...This was so amazing...it was full of a mix of flavors and then the heat...oh the heat.  Not for the faint of heart but I have to tell you, the burn does go away and you are left with the need to go back in for more.  Part of me doesn't want to expose this incredible gem hidden on RT 19, but the reality is that I want everyone to go away with satisfaction that I have right now....and I am already planning my next visit.  Thank you so much Jade Grill for opening my eyes to \"real\" Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"I found this testimonial on the Jade Grille website doesn't say enough about the place. 9th grade Latin fails me.      \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

{"text":"It was a Saturday afternoon and my insatiable craving for sushi had struck again. Since my boyfriend and I were going to be in the Mt. Lebanon area, the Jade Grill was our choice. We've never been here before, but we love visiting new places!  We decided to treat ourselves and get a couple drinks before our meal. My boyfriend got a peach bourbon mule that was delicious. I got a mojito, and I was disappointed at first because it just tasted like sugary mint water. When the waitress came to our table, I told her about my drink being weak and she quickly and happily liquored it up.  For our meals, I got a Philly roll (my favorite), a tuna roll, and a Jade roll (sweet potato tempura topped with seaweed salad and avocado). My boyfriend got a beef, chicken, and asparagus platter that was still sizzling when it arrived. Everything was delicious, and I'm a stickler about good sushi! I usually don't deviate from rolls with no seafood in them, but the Jade roll was amazing. My sushi craving has been satisfied for now, but I would not mind visiting the Jade Grill again!"}
{"text":"As a person born and raised in Szechuan China, I would like to endorse the food here. We tried 6 or 7 dishes. Only one was not as good as I like, all others are great. The food is a little bit on the salty side, but overall very authentic."}
{"text":"Justin recommended the Spicy Cucumbers ( my favorite) and steamed dumplings to start with and boy was he on point!  AMAZING!  Stuffed eggplant with pork and dried saut√©ed string beans were the entrees. So good!!   My friend from New York City visits every couple of months and this is where she requests to eat. Never disappointed when we eat here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice. They have nice, modern touches. Assuming that this was a bank prior, they have a giant safe that has table seating.    The hostess and wait staff seemed very disorganized and confused this evening. When getting led/sat at a table, it felt like we were being taken on a tour through the dining room. Let me add, the restaurant was not a full house.     Once seated (oh yes, I timed this), it took 7 minutes for our server to greet us and get our drink order. 5 minutes for us to get our water and iced tea, and another 6 minutes for us to receive our beer. The app did not come out before our entr√©es, rather it came out with it. We were obviously not being attended to, as was everyone else around us.    The food tasted good. The sushi could have been wrapped tighter. The service could have been A LOT better. The prices were a little steep.    A little tangent for this one.. Now, I understand it is hard to find good help when owning a restaurant or any other establishment, but when you start hiring the friends of the other sucky employees you already have, you are up to a lot of stress and heart ache. Food for thought."}
{"text":"Recommend pork dumplings (pretty authentic with soup in the middle. Reminded me of Din Tai Fung for you LA, Seattle, or Hong Kong folk), sashimi ceviche (!!! You will not regret this), avocado salad, and salmon skewers. They have an awesome $10 for $20 Yelp deal, too. FYI they have a Chinese menu that's not printed! You've got to be in the know. Found out only because I asked the waitresses to which dishes were some of yelp pictures referring.  I went here with a few friends after running a local 10K. Wow. It was just what we wanted after a hilly run. Great drink selection. Large menu. My friends really enjoyed their sushi rolls, soups, and spicy chicken over rice. Our waitress was very patient and attentive, too. Last random comment, the seats in the booth were super comfortable... :-)  Hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"This place recently became our new favorite. My husband and I had tried their chili fish, mapo tofu and sushi. It was the most authentic Asian food in Pittsburgh. Definitely coming back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Great eating except for numbing peppers. Beware .\"  We had 3 great appetizers and 4 entrees . Loved the homemade dumplings (6) , Go Go Rock Shrimp , and Sichuan Wings (8)  Great start . Then got our entrees Beef w/ Broccoli with brown sauce mild ample serving very tasty. Chile Pot spiced beef . Excellent beef very tasty and tender and great vegetables topped with cilantro.Hot and spicy . Veggies with chicken and garlic sauce very good . The 4th entree was a problem GongBao Chicken. Our teenage grandson bit into something he didn't like ( he likes everything) and showed us the stem. Called waitress over and she said probably ginger. He continued eating then ate it again by accident and once again a small stem. He got up from his seat to go bathroom to spit it out and wash out his mouth. We  had waitress remove the dish .He came  back and said could still feel it. Described as dry ice and numbing. We asked if hot ( he loves hot ) and he said no. When we left another employee asked how we liked our meal .I explained and he said oh numbing peppers . He said to request without . We came home and googled and saw an excellent article in Smithsonian on numbing peppers . They are not hot . It is a very different sensation. Best description is numbling . I have used Szechuan peppercorns in cooking for years  but these were very different . Perhaps they were fresh vs dried as I buy. We are all anxious to return again but will be sure ask for no numbing peppers or have them on the side."}
{"text":"What an amazing addition to Mt Lebanon's bustling Uptown district! Authentic Chinese cooking with a slew of options. Hand pulled noodles are on the menu, but they surprisingly do not celebrate this fact. I'll update review after a few more visits, but there will be more visits!   Parking is NOT an issue btw. I suppose it is if you feel entitled to a spot directly in front of where you are going. Otherwise, park your car, take a walk, window shop, check out other menus for your next visit and simply enjoy being in a dynamic business district that should be celebrated far more an it is. Haters hate and lazy lazes hate to walk. Get out there and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, seated at the bar and both times it was awful. I ordered menu mixed drink and the bartender filled half of my martini glass and finished the rest herself because she never tasted it before. The pot sticker / dumplings came out charred to whatever sauce they were pan fried in (they came out charred with the sauce in the shape of the pan) because \"that's how the owners father likes them\".  If I want to watch the penguins while listening to lynyrd skynyrd, I would go to a sports bar, not a higher end \"looking\" establishment."}
{"text":"Surprised how nice this place was! Went for happy hour and sat at the bar - excellent service, drinks, and food. The Seviche app was probably my favorite of all the food we got that night. So good. Will return."}
{"text":"I would try Jade Grille again, just for the Pad Thai.  There were only two other tables seated when we walked in at 6:15ish.  The place looks great, but the servers aren't well trained and the hostess looked like she wanted to be anywhere else.  We were seated and given menus that weren't the same.  Got two \"updated menus\" after asking which one was the right one to be using.  Ordered food.  Asked that my two small plates be served with my husband's dinner. Got my Szechuan Spring Roll in like 5 minutes.  It was hot, and crunchy, that's it.  No flavor, no nothing, even with the duck sauce.  The other small plate I ordered came with my husband's Pad Thai. The Ocean Roll was described as cucumber, tuna, and salmon wrapped in cucumber. What I was served was faux crab, avocado, tuna and salmon wrapped in cucumber.  I do not like the first two things I just listed, and had they been in the description, I would not have ordered the dish. They did make me a new order with just the cucumber, tuna and salmon, which was good.  The highlight of the meal though was the Pad Thai!!  We ended up sharing the Pad Thai.  When the bill came, the amount we were charged was different from the menu price, and we were told \"Oh, I'll let them know about it.\" but the price wasn't changed on the bill.  Overall, I think they are suffering from \"new restaurant\" issues and I would be willing to go back in a few months and give them an other try."}
{"text":"Heard about Jade Grill over the weekend and had to try it out.  We did take out but sat at the bar while it was prepared.  Nice atmosphere and Andy, the owner, was gracious and friendly. We had long green pepper pork and a garlic basil calamari for main courses with fresh spring rolls and spicy cucumber for appetizers.  The spring rolls were exactly as hoped for and the cucumber refreshing.  The two main courses were very pleasing.  We like spicy food and the long green pepper pork had a great kick. The calamari was full of flavor as well.  The next time we will sit at the bar and get to know Andy a bit more.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food and service here were above average. The selection left a little to be desired at some high prices. The restaurant was comfortable but parking is certainly an issue in the bustling uptown area.  I would like to see Jade Grille expand their menu offerings to appeal to a wider audience."}
{"text":"Incredibly fantastic and kind ownership willing to go the extra mile to ensure every customer is happy. Great authentic Chinese selection and tons of alcohol choices."}
{"text":"When I heard that Jade Grille delivered sushi I was all about it. I placed my order on the phone and was quoted 45 min. However, it arrived in 20 which was great.     I ordered the specialty Avalanche Roll, a tuna avocado roll, and salmon sashimi. The sashimi was good, fresh and a larger portion than usual. The tuna avocado roll was also good, pretty standard tho nothing special. The big disappointment was the Avalanche Roll- made with shrimp tempura and cucumber and topped with spicy tuna and sweet wasabi sauce. The shrimp was surrounded by way too much tempura breading, it was overwhelming and stale tasting.     The price was reasonable, no complaints there. I'd definitely give it another try though."}
{"text":"This place used to be a bank before, so now it becomes a restaurant. Atmosphere is very nice. Good service. The food is 7/10 good. I ordered beef with scallions, it was so good. Good in quality."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere in the restaurant and the sushi was delicious. I really liked the lo mein, but it was a little on the greasy side. The portion was good though. Also the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Some of the best Chinese food dishes I have ever eaten and very affordable. Service is typically pretty good. Sushi is just O.K. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a really good authentic Chinese meal!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese Restaurant in the area.  Hands down!  The layout inside has a lot of marble and bamboo.  I always order the sesame style chicken with fried rice.  The friend rice that comes with the meal could also literally be a meal.  It is very tasty to the point where it tasted like a hibachi style rice.  The price is very reasonable and the portions are very good.  I got a good look at the kitchen and it looks really clean and the chefs are wearing chef outfits like at a gourmet white cloth restaurant.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Always trying something new to keep the menu fresh! You have to try the eggplant appetizer. Lots of work from the staff but definitely worth it! I have never been disappointed. Some dishes are better than others, all a matter of preference-see for yourself. Staff and service are great!"}
{"text":"My husband and i visited jade grille on a friday evening at 7:00. The place was almost empty but beautifully decorated.  We ordered 3 sushi rolls, and one noodle entree and one authetic chinese dish. Everthing was just average. Although we enjoyed our visit, there are other Asian restaurants within walking distance that i would go to before coming back. Our waitress was very sweet but was unable to answer questions about the menu but this may be because of the language barrier and not so much being unfamiliar with the food."}
{"text":"With restaurants such as Jade Grille, it's disheartening to see people continue to disregard Pittsburgh's South Hills. Carrying every bit of the culinary swagger and swanky ambience of East End restaurants, Jade Grille could easily compete in a larger metropolitan area. This much was in evidence one frosted recent weekday evening when Kay and I decided to pop in for dinner.   Housed in what used to be a bank, one might feel initially unwelcome due to the elegant, nightclub-ish interiors that are punctuated by overhead lamps that resemble miniature suns and a vault door that leads to a private room. However, when you're greeted by a waitress who looks like she moonlights as a roller derby queen, you'll feel less self-conscious about your pocket t-shirt and carpenter jeans.   As I often do when I dine at Asian restaurants, I gravitated towards the smaller dishes since I tend to find them more provocative. First at bat from JG's sushi bar was the Sashimi Ceviche. Tender, buttery, raw, fresh, and refreshingly cold chunks of slippery tuna, salmon, and yellowtail were garnished with red onion, tomato, jalapeno, and cilantro, all of which was dressed with a lemon juice and ponzu. Bold flavors abounded. There was sweetness, zip, bitterness, nip. Texturally dynamic, velvet contrasted with crunch as the juicy and the saltish mingled, each component bringing out the best in each other. A standing ovation was in order for this pleasantly palate-clearing warm-up act.   The whimsically-named Dan Dan Noodles (I know a slew of Dans) were deceptively hearty despite the modest portion. Laugh at me for saying so, but I kept being reminded of a chili or a spaghetti topped with pork bolognese. The thick, glossy, soft, oily, noodles themselves were topped with a mixture of spicy minced pork, which is where the simple beauty of this rich, addictive tapa lies. You're damn right I was left craving more of it.   And there was more to eat. A trio of skewered ruddy quail eggs wrapped in bacon and glazed over with some sort of barbeque sauce helped to extinguish whatever bellyfire remained. Almost candylike, their squishy, plush innards and crisp, salty hides had me thinking of Devils on Horseback, that classic Yuletide finger food of the British Isles.    Also acting as an exercise in caramelized cunning was Kay's more conventional (JG has a section of their menu devoted to Americanized items for the timid) Honey Walnut Chicken, of which I gladly ate up a brittle, succulent, nectarous sample.   Let Jade Grille take you on a tour of the Asian continent within the safe environs of one of the nation's coziest suburbs. Hop on a trolley, and get your skinny hipster butts over here for lunch or dinner this instant!"}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience the one time I went here, the pad Thai was dry and not appetizing at all. I also threw away an entire soup because it tasted like something was wrong with it"}
{"text":"This place started out strong soon after its opening, but has steadily declined since.  The soup dumplings, which used to be one of the strongest menu items, are now bland and overcooked.  The last time fresh spring rolls were ordered they were obviously old and had been sitting in the refrigerator for several days. We've tried to order several items the last couple of times only to be consistently told that they are unavailable, leaving us with more run-of the mill choices that could be obtained at any other number of Chinese restaurants in the area.  This had been a nice option for us with a child who is only interested in \"Americanized\" Chinese, since they offer both that and more authentic dishes on the menu. However, with the prices being significantly higher than other area restaurants and the food quality being just mediocre at this point, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! The pad Thai was a bit vinegary, but that was the first time I had it, so I'm not sure how it's supposed to be. I got the jade grill hot pot. The flavones weren't complex but they were yummy and satisfying. Both meals were big enough to share!"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite for take out! LOVE the spicy cucumber appetizer and the dry saut√©ed green beans!! The pork stuffed eggplant is also on our regular order. The brown rice is delicious too!!! We also have ordered a large platter of sushi for a holiday get together and it was beautifully played and so much variety! Everyone loved it! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Philadelphia roll, spicy tuna roll, crab Rangoon, and some lo mein.   I did not think the Sushi was all that great, I have even had better at some buffets.   The lo mein was very good, and I am hard to please in the lo mein department. The noodles were a bit thicker than what I am used to, but it was a pleasant difference... almost as if they were made from scratch. The flavor was probably better than most I have had around Pittsburgh too. The crab Rangoon was also very good... there was more of the yummy, creamy filling in it than what other places give!  I probably won't be ordering their sushi again but I definitely want to sample some more of the Chinese foods on their menu!"}
{"text":"Hakka cocktail was phenomenal! Highly recommend Lo mein, noodles are house made and thick like udon noodles. Volcano roll and California roll topped with lobster was delish. Very much recommend jade grille!"}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with my first visit to this restaurant. Housed in a former bank building they use \"the vault\" for group events.  I had made a reservation and was immediately greeted and seated by a wonderful hostess and waitress who advised me where I could sit where i would feel the most comfortable.   She helped me interpret the menu since they offer lunch specials for a great deal. You would get an entree, your choice of white, brown, or fried rice and then either their soup of the day or salad with ginger dressing. The soup of the day was eggdrop and since it was hot I opted for the salad.   They offer authentic Chinese wok cuisine or if you prefer wok American Chinese cuisine. I decided to try the shrimp and scallops with mixed vegetables for my main course. I also wanted to try a sushi but she recommended that I try one of their rolls instead. I'm usually not a fan of raw fish so she suggested I try the sweet potato tempura roll. You are given both chopsticks and of course regular silverware to eat with.  The sweet potato roll had one sweet potato fry hanging out from each cut and was indeed very delicious. Shortly after I got my main course. The shrimp and scallops were a nice size and the brown sauce did not make it spicy. I'm not a spice person but they have plenty other options if you are.  The entree was very good. Needless to say, I normally go easy on the rice because I like to enjoy my entire portion. My waitress was very helpful and attended to all my needs.  There are some things I must point out however. Restrooms are located down a long flight of steps but well kept. I later learned they do have a handicapped restroom on the main floor level since the elevator in this building does not work.  Also, if you are looking for General Tso's chicken,It is listed only on the dinner menu where they have tangerine orange style wok with your choice of meat or shrimp.. That can be made General Tso style. I, however, was so pleased with my meal I didn't even think of that item.  They have a full bar and they serve regular mixed drinks including sake. Vegetarian options are available as well as take out.  Finally they are one of the few restaurants that do validate your parking garage ticket if you parking in the nearby garage.  I am really anxious to return here again and try some of their other offerings. Next time I may try one of their authentic Chinese cuisine wok meals."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to make a 2nd trip to Jade Grille for lunch.  Once again I ordered off of the Chinese menu and both of the dishes we got were excellent.  So I think the first time I visited I must have just ordered items that were perhaps too unfamiliar.  I'm loving the new \"real\" Chinese restaurants that are opening in Pittsburgh.  Its a great change of pace from Americanized Chinese."}
{"text":"I've been ordering delivery for here a few months now and have not been disappointed. Everything I've ordered has been outstanding. The handmade dumplings are good. The chicken lo mein is good and the fried rice is some of the best I've eaten. Everyone I've dealt with on the phone has been very helpful and all the delivery guys have been very friendly. This has become my go to for Chinese in Mt. Lebanon"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Their lunch specials are priced just right and taste amazing.  Their wait staff is courteous and quick.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese.  The hot and sour soup was average and very heavy on the pepper.  Would have preferred less pepper and more vinegar. The soup dumplings are very good.  We also had the pork stuffed eggplant in garlic sauce and the salt and pepper soft shell crabs.  Both dishes were well prepared."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in town! Great environment, great taste, great service, and reasonable price. LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Best spicy fish fillet pot in pgh! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to find a seat on Valentine's Day at Jade Grille.  We were told most of their reservations canceled or were no call no shows because of the weather. I have only had sushi one other time since living in Pitts and it was yucky.  Jade grille will be new sushi spot for now on.  It was delicious!  The bartender told us they get fresh fish delivered from Wholey's daily, other than Sunday's.   We ordered a smorgasbord of different small plates and sushi.   The tuna pistachio and Avalanche roll were my favorite.  The roll had a wonderful sweet wasabi sauce drizzled on top.  We chose to sit at the bar. It's a huge granite bar with four tvs and a sushi bar.  For happy hour you get buy one get one half off of sushi rolls.  Pretty good deal especially for the specialty rolls.  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Jade Grille is by far one of my favorite restaurants around Pittsburgh.  The first time that I had food from here was when I was visiting a friend who lives in Mt. Lebanon and we ordered take out.  My partner and I loved the food so when we were craving Chinese food the other night we \"made the trek\" from Brighton Heights to Mt. Lebanon to dine at Jade Grille.  Parking was easy to find even on a Friday night and we were seated right away.    We ordered several things to share and still had leftovers to take home.  We started off with the Jade Spring Roll which are rice paper wraps filled with avocado, cucumber, shrimp and basil that comes with a peanut dipping sauce - you get 2 for $5 and they were delicious.  We also had the Go Go Shrimp which are crispy fried shrimp in a spicy honey sauce which had large chunks of chopped red pepper - this was my favorite portion of our meal that night - the portion was large enough for us to both have a significant amount and take some home for later.  For our main course we shared King Kong Roll which is shrimp tempura, cream cheese topped with eel and avocado, and the Cumin Style Beef which is listed under Wok Authentic Chinese Cuisine on the menu - this is a spicy dish where the meat is crusted in cumin then stir fried with dried peppers, onions, peppers, and cilantro - the beef was tender and the spice level was great though we did ask for some chili oil on the side because we love spicy food.  We had enough to take half of the Cumin Style Beef home as well.    Overall, while the prices may seem a little steep to some, given that we both were full by the end of our meal and had enough to take home, I think that the portions and the quality of the food are well worth the price.  They also have a nice selection of sake, wine and beer.  Our server Marie was fantastic - friendly and a great server.  I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This is a brand new restaurant in Mt. Lebanon. I was expecting a crowd, but it was just us on a Sunday afternoon. Quiet and peaceful, though probably not good for business.   Friends of ours had recommended that we try the handmade dumplings, so we ordered those and the Szechuan dumplings. They are very different from each other! The Szechuan dumplings were like boiled potstickers that were in a garlic soy sauce, and though very garlicky, they were still good. The handmade steamed dumplings were fabulous! Be sure to get some extra fresh ginger right alongside those yummy pockets of goodness.  The next course was my staple order of a shrimp tempura roll and an Alaskan roll, just so I could compare in my sushi competition of life. Very good, though Jade Grill will not take a place in my top three. If I had to rate them for anything, it would be the dumplings. They were very notable.   The service was wonderful, but again, we were the only ones there. Our waitress was extremely knowledgable. She shared some chef secrets and helped to debunk a question about shrimp tails.   They have a great wine and liquor selection, and several craft beers on tap. I hope they get more busines, as I think there is great potential here."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. First time there and it was fantastic. Had General TSO shrimp. Fantastic."}
{"text":"The food at Jade Grille is fantastic! I bought one of the Yelp coupons, and used it to get an order of chicken lomein (at the hostess's recommendation) and the tuna and salmon sashimi.   Everything was delicious and incredibly fresh! And came in large portions - I have two more meals left. The noodles are some of the best homemade noodles I've had. The fish was also some of the freshest I've ever had.   My one complaint is that the person who packed my to go bag put the sushi on top of my hot lomein. Luckily, I saw right away and removed it from the bag. Otherwise, this easily could've been a low score because the fish would've been cooked. If the owner sees this, please make sure to ask your workers to package the raw fish in a separate bag from hot food.   I can't wait to come back and try one of the authentic Chinese dishes!"}
