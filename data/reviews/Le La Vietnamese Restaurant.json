{"text":"Le La is located in a strip mall in South Calgary, just off of Glenmore Trail. It's about four businesses down from the South XS Cargo, quite near Chinook Centre, and right behind the Speakeasy (heh). It's not really situated in an area I visit often, but it is definitely worth a trip if you frequent this section of the city.  The restaurant itself is rather nice. Open, spacious, very clean, and tastefully decorated. The furniture is nice, new, and sturdy, and the tables are spaced out so that it lacks the cramped feeling that you get from a lot of other Vietnamese restaurants. It was a Sunday, so business was slow and there was only one server; however, everything came to us in a timely fashion, and our waiter was very attentive.  The menu was huge, and printed in Vietnamese, English, and French (which was new to me). The prices are on par with other restaurants of this kind; although they did have really reasonable lunch and dinner specials - something that I've found to be pretty unique so far. Their pho dishes only come in a large (which is slightly bigger than the size of a regular at most other places) and an extra-large (which is massive). I had Pho Tai (rare beef and noodles), which was very good, and a fresh lemonade that was teeth-rottingly sweet. My boyfriend had the most interesting take on Pho Sate I'd ever seen - it had no peanuts and was slightly creamy, with a sort of cheese sauce added to the broth - and a hot Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. We also split a plate of salad rolls and were both comfortably full at the end of our meal. Although we weren't served a lot of meat, the amount of noodles that came in our bowls was kind of staggering.  While the food was not the best I've had, I would still go back to try the other dishes on the menu; a lot of them looked really intriguing. Le La loses one star only because it doesn't quite fit the mold for what I expect Vietnamese food to taste like (again, the cheese sauce in the Sate - while good - was a little weird). However, for everything else - the selection, the decor, and the service - I found it quite exceptional; four stars!"}
{"text":"Solid place for pho. My expectations were set low since I wasn't sure whether this place was on the authentic side or catered to the western palate. I walked in for lunch on a weekday and found myself being the only Asian. I was beginning to have second thoughts but I've already stepped in and it was too late to turn around. It took a little while for someone to come out of the kitchen to seat me. Once I was seated and brought a menu, it took a while after I had closed my menu for the server to come around to take my order. Once I did order, the pho came out immediately which was nice. I ordered the pho dac biet. Upon first taste, it was good and did satisfy the craving. The noodles were al dente and there was a decent amount of meat for the noodles. I actually found 3 pieces of tendon which was quite surprising. They also give a decent amount of Thai basil and bean sprouts. The only downfall was the soup could be hotter. Overall, I would return if I was in the area and looking for pho. Prices seem to be quite reasonable for Vietnamese food too."}
{"text":"A great lunch spot during the week.  An extensive menu of typical Vietnamese options.  Something for everyone.  They even have subs!  This, along with the fact that there is plenty of room and a few larger tables, makes Le La a good option for larger groups.  Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, decent portion size, good value.  They do not cheap out on the meat/vegetable to rice/noodle proportion in their dishes like some Vietnamese restaurants in the city do.  In summary, Le La is not fine dining or the best Vietnamese restaurant in the city.  However, it is a practical lunch/dinner spot that always leaves me satisfied."}
{"text":"This is good, fresh Vietnamese food.  The spring rolls were crispy and tasty.  My friend and I ordered the vermicelli with barbecued pork and spring rolls.  The only thing I would mention is that it would probably be better with two spring rolls because the one that did come with it was long gone before the noodles were.  Most Vietnamese restaurants do provide two spring rolls with that particular dish so I was sad to see only one because they are so good.  The portions are quite ample, by the way, other than that.  The restaurant itself is sunny and bright and we even had to get the blinds pulled down because it was really beaming in.  The server was friendly and efficient.  It's a good location because there's lots of parking.  After lunch, we walked over to the furniture store and took a look so it was nice to have somewhere to go move around a bit after a big lunch.    It was busy at lunch hour and I was glad I arrived early so we could sit by the windows.  We decided that we would definitely return."}
{"text":"I accidentally bumped into this place while waiting for my hair cut next door Lavoom.  They pack a nice typical one, two punch for a solid viet restaurant: good service, good price.  I love the all window concept. Save your money from the boring chains at Chinook mall, and spend it eating viet food for the same price, while basking in the sunlight in the relaxed atmosphere at Le La."}
{"text":"I ate here for many years when I worked down the street and was never disappointed. This was before I became a Pho addict. Since moving I hadnt been back to Le La for quite some time and had never tried their Pho. Satay Beef is my Pho of choice and I was lured in by Le La's presence on Instagram with its mouth watering pics and Peter's humor. I was also re-uniting with a friend that I had not seen in awhile and (knowing my pho expertise) put his faith in my hands to deliver on a damn good bowl of soup! I took a chance on Le La and it paid off! We both had Satay Beef Pho and it was EXCELLENT! All of the ingredients were very fresh and the beef was tender and tasty! The broth was coconut infused, which I dont come across often and it went perfectly! I couldve use a little more heat in the spice department but definitely not a complaint! It was a very full bodied soup that got the job done! The price point was VERY reasonable as we paid $20 for 2 extra large bowls of soup that satisfied both of our appetites. That bowl of soup put Le La in my top 5 Vietnamese restaurants for Pho and my list is long! Only constructive criticism I can offer is to inform customers of both broth options when ordering as there is a non-coconut broth available as well, but with that said, now I know I like coconut broth, too! Thanks, Peter! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"This Vietnamese treasure is just a hop, skip and a jump from Chinook Mall. If your looking for a clean comfortable atmosphere which pays attention to detail in your food, this is your place. We started off with shrimp salad rolls which come with a delicious peanut sauce.  The Beef Satay soup has coconut milk, red chilies and a delicious broth. A little spicy for me but my partner had the regular Pho with rare beef and it was PERFECT! Portions are huge and filling.  Service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Being generous, maybe 3.25 stars, but after requesting a certain dish that is delicious from Vietnam street food, our host couldn't deliver re. missing ingredients and perhaps flexible skills in his kitchen.  That aside, however, we sat down to two dishes, pho beef strips & pork balls, and pork & veg stir fry.  The noodle soup was only average, and even with added some hot and Viet. sauce, just not up there at all. Lots of bland beef slices, but somewhere in the mix I hit an odd flavour 3x, and it was not tasty nor complimentary to the broth at all!  The host had suggested shaken (cube) beef, but I had wanted a noodle soup, as it tends to be the definitive measure of the quality of food being put out of any Vietnamese kitchen. The pork / veg stir fry tasted better, but again just not outstanding.  Upon leaving we agreed we'd not return.  Just too bad, but without personally checking out the food we really can't qualify a restaurant, can we. That google reviewers gave 'Le La' 4.5 stars attests to how bland Vietnamese fare has bilked those not in the know. 'Tis Canada."}
{"text":"Such great Pho Tai!  I called ahead to avoid the lunch rush, and it was ready once I arrived, 5 minutes later.  Staff was courteous and upbeat!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not my favourite Vietnamese place, but it gets the job done.  The beef here is a strange texture compared to other grilled beef.  The service is fairly good and the ambiance is nice."}
