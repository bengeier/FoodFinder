{"text":"We dropped in for a quick lunch and ended up staying for two hours. The Kimchi Portobello sandwich was fantastic and the staff was nice and very knowledgeable about what they were serving. Nice little place - an office converted into a bistro. 

Very convenient if you're heading to Pearson airport. A little tricky to find, so you need to look for the signs on the windows -- but well worth the effort."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the absolute epitome of 5 Stars!  

While staying at a nearby hotel during a brief overnight layover,  I had the privilege of visiting with Ms. Lanny Liu, the owner and head chef of this quaint establishment.  To date, they have been open for approx 2 months, so they are just getting started.  Thats not so say, however, that Ms. Liu is just getting started.  As we spoke, it became evident that the crazy good food was not a mere accident or anomaly.  She's been doing this a while and it shows.  

When I think of 5 Stars, I don't think of high dollar, fancy, or lobster...I think of fresh ingredients, creative dishes, unique bold flavors, and lastly but perhaps most importantly, it has to be executed with precision.  That is EXACTLY what I found at The Mission Eatery.  With a variety of meals, from the hearty meaty, to the hearty vegan, there is a fit for everyone. Although I am not a vegan, I was lured into the vegan portobello mushroom and cheddar melt.  It was absolutely fantastic.  For a small add on price, I got their Mission salad.  Perfectly balanced with a variety of ingredients and dressing (again, they nailed it with the dressing...not too dry, but not at all soggy).

For years, I used to avoid getting stuck at this layover during a lunch or dinner meal time.  With the addition of this fantastic place, that fear is gone and replaced with the anticipation of returning to try another delicious creation.  

VERY WELL DONE!

PS.  The service and staff is perhaps the most friendly I have encountered in quite some time."}
{"text":"Arbitrarily decided to close early today. So unfortunately we have review to provide."}
{"text":"The portions are my main complaint. If you buy anything with meat, the actually quantity of meat is so less that it seems like a joke. I've gone out of my way to go here a few times and try different items, but yesterday was the last straw."}
{"text":"Excellent food, low prices and very friendly staff. It's in an office building so it was a little hard for me to tell exactly where it was, but if you just walk into the lobby, you'll see the sign. They have a great selection for breakfast, lunch, desert, coffee and tea and the place is clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Good quality food for lunch. Grilled chicken avo with hot sauce and jerk chicken meals were great!"}
{"text":"Easily best place around the area. Daily specials are updated on their website and big plus everything is made in house. Best gourmet food in the area"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of hers since it opened. The food was fantastic and the flavours complemented each other tremendously. Unfortunately, for the last few months there has been a steady decline in not only portions, but the finished product. Today was the tipping point. I religiously get the same thing every day and they remember this, but I have yet to have my sandwich made the same way. Todays BLT consisted of 2 (toonie sized) pieces of lettuce, which the chef Len flattened with her knife to make it look bigger, then it was prepared with the Mission sandwich toppings (balsamic glaze) and one half had regular mayo and the other has spicy mayo. 

Having been a loyal customer since the beginning I will be making a effort to never go there again.  I will also make sure that this becomes known amongst our guests, as I always recommended this place (until now)"}
{"text":"The only reason why I created a yelp account is because I just HAD to review this place. Tucked away in one of the business buildings along airport road is a treasure of great food with an affordable price! This is honestly such a hidden gem! I can't believe how GOOD this food is! The smoked salmon croissant is just AMAZING. 

And the best part is that everything, yes I mean everything, is made in house. I was so surprised to hear that the pickled onions and even the dressing on my sandwich is home made. 

You can tell that the owner is a true chef that is really passionate about her food! I encourage anyone and everyone to try this place out! I'm definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Came here looking for something other than a subway or Tim Hortons during a weekend event at the convention centre down the road.

It's tucked away in what seems to be an office building. 

Upon entering it looks like your typical cafeteria type lunch spot. I tried one of their salad bowls and it wasn't too memorable but I do remember it being packed with lots of ingredients.

I was just thankful that there were other affordable options aside from your regular lunch fast food spots."}
{"text":"The greatest and quaintest spot for a bite! FRESH FOOD, clean resto, great selection,  daily specials, fair price, bright seating! Very personal and kind service, free wifi, nice coffee. The entrance isn't so obvious, but go into the building lobby and make a point of finding it, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"A little hard to find but a super great little cafe with great sandwiches and salads. It smells amazing and  is always very busy. I found this place while getting my boss food for a meeting and definitely will be returning from now on. I noticed on the menu a good selection of breakfast food for a good price. For the size of the salads and sandwiches, The Mission Eatery is a reasonably priced restaurant great for breakfast, a lunch break or a mid day snack."}
{"text":"The food is very well prepared, tasty, savoury etc.  No question about that.  They also serve my favourtie coffee, Illy.  When you consider the competition around this establishment, namely the ones in neighbouring buildings, you will notice that the pricing at Mission Eatery is more expensive then the other places.  I feel like the portion sizing and pricing is relative to some fine dining restaurants when really, all I am looking for a is decent sized sandwich, soup or salad.  If this place was on Ossington & Dundas, then ya, maybe you could get away with the higher priced food because it is really well done and hipstery folks dont mind paying.  Just that there other options around the area that provide food that is just as well done, maybe not as exotic, but priced below Mission Eatery.  I would be a patron if the prices were a bit lower and the portions a bit more substantive."}
{"text":"Had an awesome Miso soup and a super healthy quinoa lentil salad!
The chef Lanny is very helpful and makes customized orders!
A big boon for vegetarians here near the airport with protein enriched meal with quinoa and lentils!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food with Great Recipes ! covering world food offerings every day . Great Price and place to eat in reasonable price. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Previous posters were right, it is hard to find. Mission Eatery is located in a nondescript office park and it takes a bit of navigating to locate the building. You also have to pay to park if you're going to be there longer than 30 minutes, and though I'm sure that is the office park's doing and not Mission's, it caused me to bring my food back to my hotel rather than stay and eat as I had planned. Perhaps that was for the better, as I wasn't completely thrilled with my experience. There is no \"order here\" sign or anything indicating a place to line up, so people milled around the counter waiting for one of the employees to take their order. After a few minutes of confusion and several people jumping ahead of me to order, I finally asked one of the employees if I could place my order with her, or if I needed to order from the gentleman further down the counter (both employees were making food). She asked what I wanted, and I told her that I wanted the Portobello grilled cheddar cheese and a salad.  She seemed confused, so I pointed out what I wanted on the chalkboard, as there were a few types of grilled cheese sandwiches available. She said, \"I'll just make it\". I felt like I was inconveniencing her, but certainly would have ordered from the proper person had she told me to do so. She walked away after giving me my sandwich, so I told another employee that I needed a Mission house salad. She made a salad and placed it on the counter in front of me, but when I asked if it was mine, she said rather curtly, \"I'm MAKING yours.\" Okay. Upon opening my \"grilled cheese\", I discovered that it was more of a veggie sandwich with a slice of American cheese, which wasn't melted or even warm. It contained kimchi, tomato, roasted red pepper, and lettuce, which made for an interesting sandwich; it just wasn't what I ordered. The Mission house salad was a good concept - kale, cabbage, carrots, and cranberries - but the poppy seed dressing (which tasted a lot like mayo) was slathered on so thickly that it stopped resembling a salad. Maybe ask for the dressing on the side if you order this.  

It's always nice to visit a restaurant with quite a few vegetarian options, and the rose-infused pink lemonade was delicious. I was looking forward to a nice lunch after reading previous reviews, but with the confusing ordering process, so-so food, and customer service from folks who looked like they'd rather be anywhere else, it was not enough to bring me back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day in between work.  Had the mission chicken panini, chocolate cookie, and a Jarito.  The panini was very good, but what blew me away was the cookie.  So soft and sweet.  I'm coming back here for lunch next week!"}
{"text":"A great find via Yelp.  Serves a local work crowd primarily but a nice alternative for hotel guests wanting something quick but quality!"}
{"text":"The Mission Eatery is a nicer office style cafeteria, but nothing overly special despite what ratings might indicate. They offer up an ordinary menu with a bit of a twist as they dabble in some oriental flavors. I noticed that they do potstickers, kimchi, and even have a banh mi on their regular menu, which is impressive.

I've had some breakfast here before and it's not bad. The breakfast is a bit small and overpriced, but you're also paying for the convenience because we work right by there as well. Also came recently for lunch, and thought it wasn't so bad. I had the Chicken Deluxe Club and it was a hefty looking sandwich. It was stacked with lettuce, mayo, thin slices of bacon, and a lightly grilled chicken breast with a fried egg and cheese. The sandwich ($6.95) was good, but a bit overpriced, especially with no sides or anything. Still tasted pretty good. Ordered a minestrone soup on the side that was more like tomato water with some veggies. 

I will say that the Mission Eatery probably has better hot food than the other cafe located nearby in one of the other office buildings, but that's not saying much. Would come back again for a quick lunch, but it's by no means a gourmet food eatery."}
{"text":"Terrible selection, very few options at 2 pm.. Only offers halal chicken which I avoid any time possible. Should at the least be optional. Can I add that this makes no sense to serve only halal chicken when almost every sandwich has a pork aspect to it? Prosciutto and halal chicken, absolute genius to come up with this idea 

Definitely not worth the detour"}
{"text":"Times are incorrect. Yelp states 0900, yet the open at 0700. Would have stopped here for breakfast instead of the hotel. Everything we saw looked fantastic and was very affordable. 

We got the Turkey BLT wrap and it was AWESOME!! We will be back for sure whenever we are in Toronto for business. 

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Clean, nice size, great prices, delicious food, all tucked away under a building. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food (if you can even call it that), at the airport is dismal, barely edible, not very fresh and completely over-priced. Mission Eatery is hidden away in an office building on Airport Road - it's called Airway Park (there are blue signs), 4 buildings, and it's super close to the gas stations and the intersection / stoplight.

This place is amazing, and I'm so happy that I finally went here after so many disappointing meals either by the airport, or in the airport. This is definitely 5 stars - affordable prices, healthy, fresh foods that make you feel like you went to your parents' house for a meal. They have their regular menu and 3-4 specials that are written on a chalkboard (and also on their website). The prices are reasonable too - I got soup and my salad for just about $10, which is what you would pay at the airport for some mediocre, bland salad.

I got a delicious broccoli lentil soup that was hearty and healthy (just pureed vegetables and lentils), with a hint of curry. It tasted homemade (I imagine it was), and was perfect to battle the cold outside.

The kale salad was good too - with cabbage, avocado, almonds & dried cranberry. There was a little bit too much dressing on there for my taste, but I should've gotten it on the side. 

Great customer service too - everyone was super friendly and nice. And when the cashier discovered I was going to dine-in, she came over to my table and brought me silverware. Complete with a smile and some nice chit-chat - these basic things are often not found elsewhere.

All in all, a perfect place to come either right after you land or before you take off, or if you stay by the airport frequently. I'll definitely be back here again. I'd recommend to anyone traveling into or out of Toronto."}
{"text":"Superbe little eatery! Good food good service. Location tricky to find, but totally worth it..."}
{"text":"One of my colleagues and I used the Mission Eatery for catering purposes back in the summer.

The first time I ordered just the Cold Sandwich/Wrap Combo for about 20 people or so. I wasn't really impressed as (1) there were no wraps and (2) the sandwiches were on Wonder-type bread with some non-appetizing luncheon meats.

The second time my colleague ordered some mini muffins for a breakfast. I can't speak for the rest of the staff or myself as I've never tried them but she said they were not very good.

The third time I tried to order Chicken Marsala but I was told that I didn't reach the minimum order. This wasn't an issue as I told them I would just use another caterer but keep them in mind for next time. Then I got calls back indicating that they would cater the Chicken Marsala but I would have to pay a fee as the order was too small. I ended up getting some staff together to pitch in so we didn't have to pay a premium. Well, when it arrived, there were all types of hidden costs that they didn't indicate over the phone. To add insult to injury, the Chicken Marsala was an unseasoned thick piece of chicken breast with what tasted to be Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup on top. Needless to say, that did NOT go over well with staff. The word used to describe it was, \"gross.\"

Needless to say, we found another caterer."}
{"text":"What amazing customer service first an foremost I've gotta point that out! Food was fantastic. Got the lentil broccoli soup which was delicious! Though I'd admit Id have liked it a tad more with salt. Think it might have been turmeric in it. The omelette while done well was served with no toast.. A tad of a let down. The quesadilla though was delicious. 

Saving the best for last I had the Japanese Beef Sandwich. It's a big piece just giving everyone a heads up. That was the creme de la creme. It's a must have! I def know where to go around the airport next time!"}
{"text":"I am not sure where all of these great reviews are coming from. I have gone here a couple time and the food is okay, but the portions are small. Also I went here for breakfast once and got the waffles, but they were just eggo's. There is no problem with eggo's, but don't call them waffles if all you are going to serve me is eggo's. Try paradise Cafe which is across the street and has a much better selection."}
{"text":"I was in Mississauga and sick of restaurant over-salted and buttered, mass produced food. So I Yelped \"healthy\" food and found this place about a mile from my hotel. Without a car, this was the distance I was willing to walk. It was Tuesday--when it was -8 degrees with 40 mph winds.......I found the place tucked off the lobby of an office building. Upon entering, I was warmly greeted and offered two samples of house soups.  YUM!  Roasted cauliflower or the second specialty, asparagus soup. It was a hard decision to choose between perfection and perfection.  I also enjoyed the house chopped salad with tofu. The tofu was by far the BEST tofu I have ever had. While walking there whipped by the 40mph winds, I thought to myself, how could any one's food be THAT good? once I got there and tasted her food, I knew why she had lots of 5 stars....and I added my own 5 stars. This place is Awesome. Treat yourself and your body to fresh & healthy by eating here"}
{"text":"This little café/bistro is a godsend considering the dearth of non-overpriced options in the area. They have a great selection and of sandwiches and salads, but the daily specials are what really shine. They serve a rotating menu of hot food combos like jerk chicken, pastas, or pad thai. I have never been disappointed with the food here, and their take on pork schnitzel is to die for."}
{"text":"We were in the area for a workshop and decided to try out this place for lunch. We were so glad to have picked this place! The food was very fresh and delicious. I had the mission panini, and a freshly squeezed beet juice. My husband got the chicken quesadilla with a mushroom soup. Everything we got was really good! The service was also fast and friendly. I ordered a cookie for desert and had forgotten to bring it to the table and the manager personally brought it to our table. Overall a friendly place with fresh and delicious food. I would definitely go back if I am ever in the area."}
{"text":"The food is definelty worth the effort it takes to find this little shop. It in a business building so you have to keep your eyes open for if. Its in a building called Airway. Look for visitors parking. 

All the sandwiches look good. I went with the chicken/prosciutto one and its 5 stars. The lady was a little slow making the food but connect to the free WiFi and you're good. Over all.. Worth it."}
{"text":"Was suggested I try this place, which is now in my new office region.
They had multiple specials on the day I went. All sounded good, but I had a hard time deciding. 

Finally went with the chicken finger special with fries. Both chicken fingers and fries had nice seasoning on them. The chicken had been freshly cooked, but the fries had clearly been sitting there for while. While the chicken was very moist and yummy, it left huge amounts of oil in the container. 

Plus, for $11, a small amount of fries, 3 large chicken fingers plus a pop. A bit on the expensive side. However, I will return to see what else The Mission Eatery has in store."}
{"text":"Healthy, delicious, super friendly staff and fairly priced...don't pass it by if you are near Toronto pearson airport!"}
{"text":"I worked at a company in that same office building for over either years, so this was my regular go-to place almost everyday for lunch and sometimes breakfast.

There are a group of office buildings in this plaza, and most of them have a sort of a cafeteria or a restaurant at the ground floor. My favourite was always the Mission Eatery.

It's a small little place, maybe 30 seats or so, but it's meant for a quick lunch break bite or so. Ownership of this place changed quite few times throughout the years, and current owner did it the best in my opinion. They revamped the menu and tweaked their best items to make them even better.
They have a website that they update every single day with the day's soup and hot main items which change everyday to give you that variety and break the routine of a fixed menu.

My star plate at this place is the Cobb salad with grilled chicken, it's probably the best cobb salad i've hd anywhere! And their Italian wedding soup (when it is available) is unreal!"}
{"text":"Excellent little cafe walking distance from a couple different hotels by thr aiport. Welcome break from conventional fast or mass produced food."}
{"text":"We were surprised by how low the prices were, and even more surprised by the quality of the food. Generally healthy means you are paying a high price for it. In this case healthy means home like at a home price."}
{"text":"There was too many yummy options so I chose two! The special of the day was a Tofu pad Thai, so I made that vegan and also got a vegan quinoa salad. Both were very filling and prices are amazing. Got two meals and a fresh squeezed juice all for under 20$. service was friendly, you can take away or eat in. Lots of fresh baked goods options as well. The menu all looks amazing, can't wait to come back back!"}
