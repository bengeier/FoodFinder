{"text":"Pretty hard to find a pizza you don't like. Adrianos was the first pizza parlour to disappoint me. Flavourless"}
{"text":"This place was dirty and the owner was extremely rude. 
I will definitely not be returning, and would not recommend anyone else go. 
Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Really thin crust was a soggy mess.  Green peppers & onion on pizza were barely cooked.  One of the worst pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"I drove by this place many times but never stopped to try the food. Yesterday, I was at a birthday party and they ordered pizza from Adriano's. I must say, I was really impressed!! All the pizzas were delicious - even the vegetarian ones which in my opinion, are usually gross.

Definitely recommended and I will surely be ordering from here in the future!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza spot in the neighborhood, and the excellence goes far beyond traditional pizza. Adriano's sandwiches are well priced are are even better than the Subway down the street, my favorite is the Meatball. Pasta and entrees are delicious and provide a tasty alternative to the pizza. The pizza is also quite good, and Adriano's wide range of toppings, many that are uncommon amongst pizza restaurants ( broccoli... yum !) as well as priced fairly reasonably, much like everything else at the store. The owners are amongst the friendliest restaurant owners I have ever met, and are very pleasant to be around and talk with. Bottom line: Adriano's Pizza goes well beyond your traditional pizza parlor experience and adds a welcome taste of Italian authenticity to the otherwise run of the mill pizza parlors in the neighborhood. Highly recommend, 5/5 !"}
{"text":"I've had Adriano's pizza many times. It is easily the best pizza on The Shore. New York style pizza is definitely welcome here.

The owner is so nice. I think some people misunderstand him because he's not always smiles and sunshine, but he works hard and he takes his job seriously. Also, I think he may be a little bit shy, but he's always respectful and polite. Also, I've seen him walking along Lakeshore, waving to the owners of other businesses and greeting other residents.

The last time I went in, my friend and I ordered a large pizza with double pep, and a medium vegetarian. While the seating area at Adriano's is relatively nice (compared to other local pizzerias) it was a hot day, so we decided to stroll The Shore while we waited. It never takes longer than 15-20 minutes for Adriano to make two pizzas for us, and he definitely doesn't rush or under-cook anything. I don't know how he does it.

When we returned, the pizzas were ready, and we got a really nice surprise. Adriano, instead of making a large and medium, made two larges and charged us the price for the medium. He didn't say anything about it, and we really weren't even sure until we were walking out the door. 

When we tried to tip him, he refused (as he always does) but I've learned that if you insist, he is too polite to not accept. Please insist. He deserves it.

The pizzas were absolutely amazing, as always. The pepperoni was definitely double, and the vegetarian was simply the best vegetarian I've even had. The spinach is a nice touch. And because he gave us a large veg, I had leftovers for days.

Other pizzas I recommend are The Lakeshore and Hawaiian, but I've never had a bad pizza from Adriano's, so I imagine you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza place around, it is my go to place and the owners are extremely friendly and kind.  The shop is always clean and well kept inside and out. The thin crust is perfect and the sauce is to die for. This place has a wide range of fresh toppings which I love and the rest of the food such as the sandwiches and pastas that I've tried have all been real Italian style and made perfectly! I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Decent, average SLICE.
never tried the other items, meatball, etc.
Bigger fan of another pizza joint down the block."}
{"text":"Amazing taste and value for your local pizza joint.  $3 straight up a slice of pepperoni.  You can't go wrong! The slice was evenly coated with sauce and blend of cheese. Good number of pepperoni piece.  Wasn't overly salty.  Crust was light and slight crispy not oily.   Washed it down with a can of ice cold coke."}
