{"text":"My family's favorite!  Can't say enough about the service, everyone including the owners are so gracious, friendly and fast.  Every time we visit, we feel like family.  The food is AMAZING!  I'm very picky when it comes to mexican food and Caldero is Tops!  The portions are more than what you would expect and are beautifully presented.  My partner and I especially love the happy hour specials, the barbacoa street tacos are to die for.    If you love true authentic mexican food at a great price you must visit Caldero - you will NOT be disapointed."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday and it was not really busy but more people came in as it got a little later. The service was great and the chips and salsa were awesome. We all ordered something different and shared and the food was good and the prices were reasonable. We thought the margarita's were a little shy of tequila so the owner came over and fixed them right up. We will go back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The pablano salsa was amazing! I highly recommend the lemon cilantro rice and black beans for your sides."}
{"text":"For the last six months I have been intrigued by this little building with a sign reading \"Coming soon Caldero.\"  Needless to say I wanted to see if this was just another simple Mexican Restaurant or something more.  After tonight I definitely believe it to be the ladder.  My wife and I had the Mole with Chicken and the Pork stuffed Poblano and I couldn't be happier.  I am excited knowing that this is within walking distance, but I encourage all of you to drive over and check it out.  Their happy hour specials are reasonable and you won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"I drive by this new restaurant on the way home from work, and it was actually the sign in front that drew me in one day. The sign itself is stylish and well done, and I hoped that it was emblematic of an attention to detail.   I experienced excellent customer service from the moment I arrived, with a warm greeting at the door. We decided to sit in the bar because the atmosphere was a little livelier, and the bar was quite handsome. I'm a beer drinker, and I was happy to see draft beer (which seems rare for many Mexican restaurants), and a nice selection within those five or six draft options.   The food highlight was actually the complementary chips and dips, which included bean dip, spicy salsa, and a smooth mild salsa verde. I ordered the pollo en mole and my partner ordered a trout dish. Both were solid, but the chef did overlook a couple of small bones in the fish. Nonetheless, the overall experience was impressive and I look forward to visiting this young restaurant again."}
{"text":"Great service, great prices, great chips and salsa, great margaritas, great entrees! REALLY hope this place stays around.  One of the best Mexican restaurants in the area for a long time. Thrilled to have something so good so close to home. Was bummed to see that it was practically empty on a Saturday night, but hoping that changes soon.  This place DESERVES to be around for a long time!!!!"}
{"text":"I have come here multiple times on trips to the area. Service has always been great and the food is top notch. On the last trip I ordered the Chicken Fajitas and they were great. I would say it is a must try."}
{"text":"Wow!  Thanks Yelpers for the great reviews of this wonderful restaurant!!  I had the enchiladas, one w/red and the other green, cilantro lime rice and refrained beans.  My husband had the Carnitas Estilo Michoacan and I had to stop him from licking the plate when he finished it!!   Everything has a BIG, rich flavor!  The chip were warm and fresh and we couldn't decide which of the salsas we like best.   Generally, we like to go to a different restaurant each night while on vacation, but we might have to return here.   Yummmm....!"}
{"text":"**First of all, this restaurant is not traditional Mexican cuisine.  They offer a combination of Mayan and Aztec flavors and dishes, which I have to say, makes for some delicious offerings.**  I am a native Texan (meaning I hold Mexican food near and dear to my heart), and since moving to the Scottsdale area 5 months ago, I have been searching far and wide for a \"Mexican\" restaurant that I can claim as my go to spot.  Now granted, Caldero may not be \"Mexican\" cuisine by traditional standards, but no matter, because my boyfriend and I have claimed this restaurant as \"our place\", meaning we are planning on becoming regulars at Caldero.    We have been there twice within the last week, sitting at the bar both times because the owners, Ricardo and Julia, are both inviting and fun to talk to.  Both times we have indulged in the Calderita cocktail, a margarita made from tropical fruit juices with just a hint of habanero.  It's sweet and spicy and oh, so good!  We have also been unable to resist their Toritos, wax peppers that have been stuffed with shrimp and cheese, wrapped in bacon, fried and served in a pool of a spicy chipotle sauce and a heavenly beurre blanc.  These are seriously one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life!  No exaggeration.  My boyfriend and I have both woke up thinking about them almost on a daily basis since first trying them.  They will definitely be a staple every time we return to this new, surprisingly superb restaurant.   I want to urge everyone to give it a try because it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Not the cheapest mexican place around, but the flavors are there.  Comfortable atmosphere and excellent service.   The lunch specials for less than $10, and happy hour til 7 will have me coming back.  The black beans were good, and the spanish rice was fluffy and flavorful.  Chips were thin, crispy and not greasy."}
{"text":"Recommended by another chef, this proved to be a true gem.   Delicious, beautiful presentation  and reasonable, not bad for overpriced Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Awesome chips and salsa to start. Had the Chicken Chimi and it was great. Service staff was excellent too. Decor was modern and clean.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Shredded beef burrito was good though not enough heat. Service was good. Definitely should visit."}
{"text":"Someone recommended this place and they were right. This is real Mexican food right in the middle of Scottsdale. We ordered the tilapia chicharron and the Tampiquena...they were both really good, the meat was tasty and juicy. The salsas and chips that they serve you in the beginning are to die for! ..great service and great environment. I went to get lunch but they told me that at night they have a DJ, we are coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing flan, great food, cheap tasty drinks.  Color me pleased.  During happy hour until 7PM or all day Sunday it is $3 for a top shelf mojito in Scottsdale, and $5.50 for 5 street tacos.  Seriously, what is better than that?  An early reviewer said expensive, but compared to what? Taco Bell drive thru?"}
{"text":"I checked out Caldero based upon the \"just drove by review\" on the 5th.  I just happened to be walking by!  I live just a couple blocks away, but usually don't head West down Thomas when going downtown, so I didn't even know it was there.  I was blown away when I saw what they'd done to the building that used to be the banana thing.    I guess I was there for the Grand Opening, and a bit early, but when I walked in the amazing smells overwhelmed me!   I was just stopping in to see if they had a take out menu, but I blew off the rest of my day and sampled everything I could get my hands on.  One of the family owners stopped by and greeted me at the bar while I was trying to decide what to do with myself in this oasis of what I've now learned is sort of nuevo Mayan food -- or at least it's new to me!  The decor is sort of simple, but it totally is overwhelmed by what comes out on the \"plates\" -- I almost fell off my bar stool when I saw the folks next to me receive their \"nachos Calderos style\".  If I could figure out how to get the picture I annoyingly took with my B-Berry up here it would blow you away!  The fresh guacamole load up on that thing was like a meal in itself! (and you MUST try the guac!).  I only snacked because I had to go to dinner at another location, but my  mind was exploding as I watched amazing seafood, salad, pork and chicken combinations pass by me.  I brought home a take out menu that's been haunting me all night!  I made a calendar of what I'm going to have this coming week.  They evidently serve lunch from 11 to 3 -- 10 specials on the lunch menu, so I'm going to have to double up on Monday and Wednesday.  Price wise it's not the cheapest \"taco\" in town, but they aren't serving \"tacos\" per se -- there's a Taco Bell about 100 meters away if you want that stuff.  Personally I think they are under pricing their entrees, certainly the lunch menu.  The bar is fully stocked, and they've got beers from South of the Border that I've never even heard of before!  And this berry fruit beer that evidently is all the rage for chicks that don't like beer.  I tried a sample and it's like candy!  The staff operates like an in-tune family, which is pretty solid for a place that just opened up.  The only problem is that you might feel overwhelmed as they welcome you through the door like you're an old friend!  Restaurants come and go like wildfire in Old Town, but I think this one, just a couple of blocks South of the \"beautiful\" people is definitely going to be around for a long time!  The setup is is pretty tight too, the bar side is configured for dancing and the traditional restaurant side is boothy and family friendly.  I'm almost thinking that I shouldn't be telling everyone about this now!  I figure Lunch for one at around $10 plus booze, tip and government graft.  Dinner, if you do it right with an appetizer is like $20-25, 30-35 if you go seafood, plus booze, tip and government graft.  If you get the Nachos Calderos Style -- that's definitely a 2 person split, maybe even 3 or 4!  Come hungry and expect to be treated like family, like restaurants are supposed to treat people!"}
{"text":"The food was legit.  I think this place is a sleeping giant, but they are not quite ready for a busy show.  Being very picky, the CRUZ margaritas were a bit pricey shrink the glass option.  I like less mix and more tequilla.  Other than that, it is good food.  The green salsa was interesting as I could not distinguish what type of cheese was added.  Hoping queso fresco, but probably velvetta."}
{"text":"There's this smell as soon as you walk in that is kind of unpleasant.  Bathroom-esque.  Its weird because I actually went to the bathroom and it doesn't really smell.  Its actually pretty nice in there.  They have to do something about that smell....  I'm not sure what all the excitement was over the chips and salsa.  The chips were not as greasy as some places and actually a little thicker.  The red salsa was pretty good, but wouldn't say the best in this area.  (Los Olivos takes that prize).  There's this other creamy weird looking sauce they put out as well with the chips.  Not very good at all.  They should just replace that with the verde sauce in the sauce bottle that they bring with the tacos.  I do agree that the plating's very well done here.  We got the hot wings which were solid.  Not the best but definitely not the worst.  Cooked well, not too small, good sauce and good amount of sauce.  The wings probably could have used a little seasoning to them to the next level.  The carnitas street tacos were also pretty solid.  Not sure if the grilled onions work here..  I think I would've preferred just the pico de gallo type topping on these.  They were really good though, esp with the salsa verde and the salsa rojo (we asked for more to eat the tacos with)  All in all, I think I'll go back and try an entree.  Might see another star......  but I'll probably wait for one of those mailing coupon deals.  The prices aren't crazy, but given the hh food I'd rather not gamble big on this one.  The hh prices aren't great either - about $5 for pretty much every choice, alcohol's a bit better at about $3."}
{"text":"I had the WORST experience at Caldero! We were the ONLY customers in the entire restaurant, but it took forever to get any service. We waited 10 minutes to get our chips, another 10 minutes just for water, another 20 minutes to place our order, and almost an entire hour to get our entrees. We were a large group of 17, but the wait was ridiculous. Good thing I had cash on hand - they probably would have  taken another 20 minutes to run my debit card. Never again will I return to this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"They changed the menu and no longer have salads or the unique items I mentioned from 1-24-12 so we left. I don't think it is necessary to drop a star since my last meal was good."}
{"text":"NOOOOOOOO!! Who did I piss off to cause this calamity to fall upon me?  ******************CLOSED********************  In its place...Filiberto's Mexican Food & Bar.  I'm so confused.  Review coming."}
{"text":"I live across the street from here and for 6+ months have been telling myself I would stop in ... I finally did and I was pleased!!  The bf and I popped in for a late lunch/early dinner and the place was empty (4pm on a Saturday) which we found a little odd, but sat down at the bar anyway.  Bf had the Calderita (a margarita with jalapeno infused tequila) it was too spicy for me, but he liked that it wasn't overly sweetened like other margs. I had the strawberry mojito which was nice and not overly sweet either. the bartender brought us out some chips, salsa and some green chile dip while we waited for food. Chips didn't appear to be homemade, but I didn't care because that warm green dip was so good! I coulda put it on cardboard and been happy.  ;) I wasn't super hungry so I just ordered the \"small nachos\" with chicken. This is $5 at full price and I wasn't expecting the mass pile of food that was placed in front of me. Everything you want in a nacho was there... Lots of cheese, black beans, lots of succulent shredded chicken, pico, guac and sour cream. Love-love-loved it! I over ate and left way too full. The bf had the chicken mole and he claimed it to be his new official favorite mole. Their mole is a family recipe and he made sure to give compliments to the chef!  He got 2 sides with his entree and one of his choices was a lemon-cilantro rice... I of course had to try this.... Matter of fact, I tried about 4 bites cuz it was so good! The bartender said they do a happy hour all day on Sunday, so I'm thinking the next time I get a wild hair and bar-hop on Sunday, I have to work them into rotation!"}
{"text":"a buddy of mine couldn't say enough great things about this place, so we met him and his girlfriend here last night for our first try.   it was very quiet and quite empty, but that didn't turn us off. i started with the calderita margarita, a very large and tasty drink with a peppery kick. we had the fish taco appetizer and i thought it was very good. the mango salsa added a nice spicy/sweet flavor.   my entree was a seafood \"soup\" in a white sauce. honestly though, as i was eating it, it didn't have any mexican flavor...it was more of an italian style dish. plus, several of my clams weren't steamed open, which means somethings wrong. the very least, they should've removed them from the dish. i've read if you eat unopened clams, you can get extremely ill. my wife had the shrimp diablo. yes, they were very hot, but at 24 bucks, i thought she'd get more than 4-5 shrimp.   the chips and salsa were fine. we had to keep asking for more chips and never got the salsa's refilled...big disappointment. they did not pass the water glass test. our server was sweet, but hard to find. what disappointed me the most was what our dining companions had to say. his g-friend had the calderita as well and had to send it back. minutes later, my buddy had to have his calderita sent back. he was disappointed in his normally outstanding pasta dish. they both apologized for suggesting Caldero and said our experience this night wasn't indicative of their previous dining experiences there.   and they advertise as a tequila bar, but we never saw a menu for tequilas...maybe if you sit at the bar. overall, i thought our dishes were overpriced and lacked Mexican inspired flavors. our friends will be back as they had previously good experiences, but we have other places we want to try so i doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"They have done a great job with this place. It has been fixed up and you would never know this was formerly occupied by the smelly Banana Leaf. I had two tacos with a side of guac. It was delicious. You MUST have the guacamole. So nice to have something this good in  my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"We had a great experience this week at the bar with Ricardo.  He made some great menu suggestions (chile verde pork plate and tamales) and spun up some delicious drinks.  The salsas and dip (trio which comes with the chips) were amazing, and the atmosphere was friendly and nice.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"In a city full of great Mexican restaurants it's hard to differentiate yourself from the crowd. Let's admit it, we all have our favorites... so we had to admit being a bit jaded when asked to try Caldero by a friend. (okay we admit, we even put off going for a few weeks). We were wrong, and we fully admit our mistake... see we can act maturely! Located on Thomas, east of Scottsdale Rd., Caldero impressed us with their unique Mexican food at very affordable prices. Looking for the standard Americanized Mexican... you won't get that here. Instead you will find authentic regional dishes prepared with care and handed down by the owner's mother, who still oversees all the sauces. And the sauces are what sets Caldero apart from the pack. I'll let you in on one of our 'little secrets'... want to judge a Mexican Restaurant... ask to taste their Mole Sauce. If they don't offer Mole... run.  I can vouch that the Mole sauce here passed the test with flying colors, great consistency, not too sweet, right amount of kick. Yep, they had us at the Mole.  Full review here.... http://schmoozeaz.com/blog/?p=974"}
{"text":"this neighborhood  restaurant has undergone it's 3rd reincarnation, this time as a mexican restaurant. the inside is pleasant and comfortable, but unremarkable. the service was outstanding, although the food was ordinary. My margarita was just a little too unfrozen, and the chimichanga was smaller than one might expect. all that aside, the food was very tasty, and the salsas served with the chips were very good. it wasn't busy when we went, so the fact that we were the only people in the place was somewhat disconcerting. in any event, I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised how good the food is here. I had a chicken burrito and for the price and quality I really enjoyed it.  The chips and salsa are amazing two different salsas. Happy hour is amazing the only downfall is the atmosphere they had a bootleg UFC fight on every tv. Like the fights you see on a weird channel, Just kinda weird for a Mexican joint. I hope this place stays around I didn't see too many people in here."}
{"text":"Caldero. Wow, where do I start?   My husband and I do our best to support local (non-chain) businesses, and are thrilled to share our fantastic experience at Caldero.  Hubby had been to Caldero about a month ago and suggested we go there. I was skeptical when I saw the exterior. The building is very plain and non-descript, but at least it wasn't a dump. I learned from the owner that it was a former Asian restaurant.  Once inside, my concerns vanished. The interior is simple, but clean and new. [Side note: The ladies' room was spotless and nicely decorated. Okay, guys, I know you couldn't care less, but for the ladies, it does matter. Seriously, I've been in a lot of restaurants all over the world, and have seen some very scary loos. In fact, it reminded me of the ladies room at Cork :) It was a very pleasant surprise.]  We were greeted immediately, and decided to sit at the bar. We were so glad we did. As it was mid-afternoon, the place was not very busy, so we were able to chat with the owner, Ricardo. He's a charming, friendly guy, who is passionate about his food and his restaurant. He explained that their menu is Aztec & Mayan. As we've traveled throughout Mexico, we've had prior experiences with this cuisine, so were interested in his interpretation.   This is precisely the type of restaurateur we like to support. The owner clearly loves good food and drinks, and is great with people. He explained that the current menu is geared toward winter (heavier, comfort foods), and that he plans to change the menu seasonally. I knew then that this was not the typical Sonoran-style Mexican restaurant that is so prevalent in the valley.   To start, we ordered chips which came with two salsas and a bean dip. Not sure what the two salsas were, but I was ready to take home a bowl of each. The green (which I later learned was Poblano) was unbelievable and I tried to keep it all to myself. That is, until I tried the red. It was equally delicious. I'm not sure which I liked better, and the bean dip was delicious as well. I usually prefer pico de gallo, but these fresh, homemade salsas were a delight.  My husband ordered the chicken burrito lunch special with lime rice and charro beans. He cleaned his plate completely, aside from allowing me a couple of tastes. I enjoyed the paltry bites he shared.  I ordered two tacos a la carte, as tacos are often rather small. Size was not a problem at Caldero. I would have been completely satisfied with one taco, but was glad I had ordered two since hubby wanted to taste them both (translation: eat half of each). I had a shredded beef/crispy corn taco and a shredded chicken/soft flour taco. The beef was juicy, tender, and moist; the chicken delectable. Both were seasoned to perfection.   Did I mention the margaritas? The house margarita is smooth and flavorful, but the true gem is the house specialty, the Calderita. I won't divulge the secret recipe, but suffice to say, we were blown away. Ricardo gave us each a sample and then asked us to try to guess the ingredients. He is one creative man and that was one memorable drink. When he told us everything that was in it, we both agreed we could taste each ingredient, even though there were so many. That's what comes from using quality, fresh ingredients.  Some other Yelpers have mentioned high prices. I disagree. They had several lunch specials under $10. The taco special is one taco, rice, and beans for $7.50. Considering the excellent quality of the food, plus size of the taco, and the portions of rice and beans, that's a completely reasonable price. This is not *****berto's drive thru. It is fresh and high quality, so no, it isn't cheap. But I do think the prices are fair and it was worth every penny. Our tab was $32 with two margaritas, chips & salsa, a burrito lunch special with rice and beans, and two tacos.   Keep your money in your community - shop and dine at non-chain establishments.   Give Caldero a try, you won't regret it. ¡Muy delicioso!"}
{"text":"wow! Just came back from this place and I'm too full to move! The food was so good, that it was impossible to not overeat ! The grilled fish tacos, are super jummy, full of flavor... read a couple reviews on here about it being pricy, and not full of flavor, was kind of hesitating to go there but very glad we did. I asked them to make fish fajitas, they didn't have it on the menu but they made it and they were delishes!!! My boyfriend had lamp and although he is very picky with his meat he said that this tasted very good, tender and flavorful. I'm vegetarian so cant tell you anything about meat dishes in this place but the appetizer and my fish fajitas were full of flavor, very fresh and tasty. Bloody marys were also very good and a little spicy - jummm! If we ever come bask to Arizona we will be visiting this place !"}
{"text":"This restaurant should be rated $$$$.   $7 for one taco at lunch time with no side(s)?  I think not; I walked out after seeing the prices.  I wasn't prepared to pay $30 for a mexican lunch for one."}
{"text":"I went in looking for a good margarita and some food. I asked if they made they margarita  mix fresh with real limes or used a sweet and sour mix. They use a mix and add to it. So I did not order a margarita., I looked at the menu and decided it was too expensive for me to eat  there. $10.00 for a cheese  enchilada and sides, first I really didn't t want the sides , there was no ala carte menu. So I opted not to eat there. The place was nice and clean. The customers are rude."}
{"text":"I live right by this place and pass it almost every day.  I finally gave it a try and I was happy I did.  It wasnt very crowded but it was very well designed inside and i really liked the food.  Definitely authentic mexican food with friendly service.  I am happy I checked it out and will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa - hands down.  Jalapeno bean dip is excellent.  The service was great, they made special orders for us with no problem.  They are not cheap, but you get quality food and good service.  If you want cheap, go across the street to Tacos Jalisco.  I have also heard that they have really good margaritas.....hope to try one soon"}
{"text":"I've been to Caldero's probably half a dozen times now, and I always walk away glad that I went in.    The staff is always friendly and welcoming, particularly the male bartender/manager/owner (I'm not sure which one he is) who always remembers me and my boyfriend when we come in.   The chips and salsa that they put on your table after you are seated also comes with a queso sauce that is to die for, and I really wish they would put it on the menu.    The prices are fantastic for a sit-down restaurant, and the portions are more than adequate, and border on generous.   You can order items a la carte, and while most restaurants charge through the nose to do so, Caldero's doesn't.  You can get a Carnitas burrito for $4.50, or a Carne Asada burrito for $5, both of which are literally only pennies more than you would pay at Filliberto's and the quality is much better.  They have a bunch of a la carte items, and all are more than reasonably priced.   My favorite entree so far is the Chicken Empanadas plate.  It comes with two empanadas stuffed to the gills with white meat chicken, and whatever sides you choose.   You get a choice of what your sides are, instead of just having rice & beans dumped on your plate.  I always request the lemon-cilantro rice and the charro beans, but there are many other options.    I've had their carnitas, and their carne asada, and both are juicy, flavorful, and have just the right amount of spice.   Their fried ice cream is to die for, so if you can, save room for dessert, or do what we did: just went in one night for dessert alone.   The only thing I could think that people might need to know is that overall, the food here is a bit spicier than most restaurants like Garcia's or Macayo's might make,  The food heer just has a little more kick to it than you might be used to from other places.  I'm not a big \"hot\" food fan, but it still doesn't bother me.  You just may notice that your mouth is tingling a bit when you leave.   All in all, I can't recommend this place more highly.  Great food, even better prices, a friendly staff...this place has everything, and it's my go-to spot now for mexican food, and I'm doubly lucky that it's close because I won't eat mexican frood from anywhere else now.   I notice some people in other reviews saying it's expensive, but  unless you're ordering the rib-eyes, or the seafood plates, I don't see how anyone could consider this place pricey.  And, if you're going to order a rib-eye...what do you expect???  I go to steakhouses a lot, as well, and Caldero's steak prices were average.    I came here one evening with the BF and a friend of ours.  My BF got the nachos (which is just a mountain of food in itself), I got the Chicken Empanadas, our friend got a carne asada burrito, there were 2 sodas and a beer, and including tip, we spent $35.     Expensive? Not at all."}
{"text":"Loved it ..wife and i looking for place to eat as we were going up and down Scottsdale rd lucky she noticed the sign and we turned on thomas and pulled in..was impressed at decor new and nice..Hostess was very helpful in giving suggestions, server was also great. the owner gave us sample of their Caldera Margarita. whoohoo spicy.. we had regular Margs instead..the food was outstanding..chips and salsa to start , bean dip, and a green chile queso. wow..then we shared some apps that were on special for sunday evening..Had and awesome dinner with drinks for less than $50. cant say enough good things..they are new just opened couple months again..we really wish them luck wish was closer to home , but we will be back.. Nice bar and TVs."}
