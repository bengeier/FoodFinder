{"text":"Great place for quick counter service. Friendly staff and very clean. Food is very fresh and prepared to order. I had spicy chicken donburi, my husband had a Thai chicken bowl and our kids had beef bulgogi bento boxes. Not a grain of rice was left!  Recommend."}
{"text":"New restaurant in c√¥te-des-neiges. 

I got myself a bulgogi bento as a first timer here and it did not disappoint. The beef and mushrooms were cook right and it is fresh. For the price of 10.35$ w/o taxes you get a large tray of food, miso soup and a sesame paste mochi dessert. All this for lunch or Supper.  I think the salads took a little too much place in the tray. 

Overall, I believe this is a restaurant that have the potential to stay. It is healthy and filling.... just what CNG needs around."}

{"text":"Went for the first time today, as the look of the place from the outside didn't appeal to me at first, but I thought, heck, let me go in and see.  Was pleasantly surprised!  Great, semi-healthy place for when you want something quick, but still want a real meal with veggies.  I got the chicken basil rice and veggie bowl and was very satisfied.  Super tasty with lots of fresh veggies.  And was about $10 so very affordable."}
{"text":"At long last a healthy option for a quick meal in CDN! This is a counter service restaurant where friendly staff will prepare delicious and inexpensive Japanese-Korean bento or donburi for you in a minute. Besides the yummy dishes, I like their selection of beverages: they didn't just settle for the ubiquitous sodas (though they have that too if you're not into mugicha or peach juice). Take away available and there's a small terrasse too. This new restaurant will be a hit!"}
{"text":"Great place for semi-healthy quick Asian-fusion food!
The food is prepared fresh right in front of you, yet it still only takes about 5-10 minutes for your order to arrive. 
In addition to bentos, there are amazing soups, donburi, and \"health bowls\" (large salads with a ton of veggie goodness) to choose from. 

I had the bulgogi bento, which came with a perfectly salted miso soup, a great salad, a fried spring roll, a couple of edamame, and a desert.
I wished there had been more of the salad - the dressing was great. The spring roll was ok, the edamame would have been better if they'd been hot, but still nice and fresh. The desert was a sesame ball with red bean filling served in a tangy orange sauce that cut the sweetness of the pastry perfectly.

I'll sure be back to try the health bowls - they looked epic!"}
