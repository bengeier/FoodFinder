{"text":"I used to love this place, service was always super friendly and fast but the last few times I've been sorely disappointed. I generally only come here for the pho, been here 3 times in about 4 weeks, 2 times they were out of pho and boba, last week took 35 minutes for take out, 1 other person came in, ordered and was out before I was. Tonight was the last time I will ever come here. Service was terribly slow (only 1 other table that came in after us, who got their food and drinks before us) were out of sate pho AGAIN, was half way through my meal before I got my Thai tea while my other parties got there's almost right away. Didn't get more water, checked on once. We had to get up and ask for our check so we could get out of there.  Time for a new pho place in north Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious smoothies!! Yummy!!  I have tríed both honeydew and the coconut smoothies!! I Will be trying the yellow curry chicken today."}
{"text":"worst Pho I ever had. the meats were frozen. in fact it was so frozen that it stillnjad frost on them. not to mention that I wanted to dine in and they bagged everything to go.  Who doest that?"}
{"text":"I never had a problem with this place until today when they messed up my order. They must've had a dumb new cook today or lazy one. I usually order the Pineapple fried rice and my boyfriend gets the yellow chicken curry which comes with white rice. I call and place an order for pick up for the Pineapple fried rice, blueberry boba smoothie and yellow curry. My boyfriend picked up the order and when he brought it home we looked in the bag and the box of white rice was missing. They forgot the rice! Then he was mad and left out to go back to the place to tell them. Meanwhile,  I'm at home eating and as I was looking through my Pineapple fried rice THERE WAS NO PINEAPPLE.  I searched from top to bottom all over..no pineapple. HOW THE HELL DO YOU FORGET PINEAPPLE IN AN ENTREE WITH PINEAPPLE BEING THE FIRST WORD AND INGREDIENT? That's like ordering a pepperoni pizza but they forgot to put the pepperoni on it.  Or a cheeseburger and they forgot the cheese wtf.       Unfortunately it was to late to do anything because I already ate through it and my boyfriend came home with his rice, so I didn't want to call or have him make another trip back there. I'm upset and all it takes is one time for a restaurant to screw me over and I'm done forever. The whole meal caused $27 but was missing the most important ingredient in my favorite dish. The only good thing was the blueberry boba smoothie which was delicious and tasted like real blueberries, hopefully they used the real fruit.   I usually cook but they definitely lost a good customer so I'm gonna make my own Pineapple fried rice at home. It's a simple recipe. USE PINEAPPLE. I was so upset that I downloaded this yelp app and had to write this review and I usually never do this but today I had to because of the retard who made my food. VERY DISAPPOINTING AND WILL NEVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"Found something that looked like a pubic hair on the rim of my glass... I cancelled the order, and will never return."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed. This was my 4th time eating here and quite possibly my last.   First, I ordered the speciality fried rice (The server described it as \"the white fried rice and not the dark\") It came with chopped pork, chicken and whole shrimp. The shrimp had their intestinal tracks still intact. The chicken was really dry which makes me think they used old leftover pre cooked chicken. And the rice was hard and some pieces were crunchy. When fried rice gets stuck in my teeth, it's not good fried rice.   I also ordered the rare beef Pho. When the server brought the plate of Jalapenos, bean sprouts, and thai basil, the jalapenos were dry and rotting, the basil came wilted and had a lot of brown spots. I asked her to change it out and she did.   Usually whenever I get Pho, it comes steaming hot. Since I only saw little puff of steam, I knew I was in trouble. I went to stir it and the noodles on the bottom were still clumped together, and a small ice cube was in the noodles! I pulled it out and kept stirring the Pho to loosen the noodles. Usually when I get the rare beef, the soup cooks it because its so hot. Not this time... After I tasted it, I called the server over and asked her if she could warm it up in the microwave because it was luke warm. After 15 mins, the little old lady in the back came out with the Pho and said that if I order rare beef it will stay rare. I told her that was fine, but I didnt want cold soup.   When I got the Pho back, I could tell she just boiled the hell out of it because it was full of floaters from the cooked blood from the rare beef. It just looked disgusting. I couldnt eat it, and asked for my check. Instead of making things better, the server just gave me the check and I paid 25.00 for NOTHING. (I did drink my Thai tea)    There was a total lack of service. There was only one other person during my entire visit. Nobody ever really checked on my table. And it was hard to get the servers attention when I needed something.   I am really surprised at the quality of the food, because their sister restaurant Da Lat is outstanding. I thnk the manager or chef at Da Lat needs to pay Jasmine a visit...."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner tonight.  Love their custom drinks- especially Thai and Milk Teas with Boba.  Staff nice, restaurant is always clean.  Family Favorite- Been a customer since they opened...always have something new on the menu.  Wor Wonton is amazing, Pork fried rice is a favorite as well."}
{"text":"I ordered from this restaurant and it was not what I expected. The food I ordered was burnt and when I had it delivered, I didn't have the time to check the order in front of the delivery man (I was at work.) When I called, the person on the phone was very adamant on telling me that I was wrong and that it wasn't burnt. They refused to give me the partial refund that I requested. All I wanted was the six dollars I spent on the egg rolls back, they could have the money for the rest of my order. I know that days can get busy and it is stressful, but there is a certain level of decency that people should have for each other. I'm sure the workers are lovely people, but today was not their finest day.  EDIT: The people from GrubHub were not rude. The employees at Jasmine Express were."}
{"text":"Might help if they know what their advertising. The cashier didn't even know what I was talking about when I mentioned the yelp post...upsetting. Food was pretty good tho"}
{"text":"I have to write a review for this place because there are so many high reviews that I think they must be fake. I'm not a picky person, but the food that I got was bad. I got the Korean barbeque ribs and I couldn't even cut through them with a knife. They were all fat and hardly any meat. I don't like how there's no one in the restaurant to greet people when they come in. The girls go in the kitchen and even though the door makes a noise when someone comes in, no one comes out and they end up standing there awkwardly and waiting like 10 minutes. It made me feel uncomfortable when two separate customers came in and waited like that and started getting mad when no one came to them. The restaurant also doesn't seem clean. I went in the bathroom and it was dirtier looking than a gas station bathroom. There was no soap or paper towels at all. This was probably one of the worst restaurants I've been to (although the waitress we had, a little girl who looked like she's probably in high school, was really nice)."}
{"text":"Service and timing are really lacking, but the food is good. First, we've (fam of 4) always had our food delivered and this time decided to dine-in. I'll either stick to delivery or have to place our dine-in order 20-25 minutes before arriving and hope that they have our small order ready to serve at one time instead of 10 minutes apart on a not so busy night. There were only 3 tables occupied including ours..the other two tables were couples. One table complained because they served the dude the rare beef pho and not the well-done. So hearing that and experiencing what we did with our order, I'd say to make sure they repeat your order back to you. Try their other fried rice, they're tasty...the regular kind is a waste of $."}
{"text":"I really like this place when I need to satisfy my Pho kick! The Pho is always delicious, and ordering pick up is always very quick. I always order a Thai iced tea with boba and usually they are on point, but this time it seems that they have switched their boba. The boba instead of being the large balls are now the small tiny ones. Still good none the less, I just prefer the normal boba size balls."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Every time im in Vegas I have to come here. I usually get the chicken Phö to help with my hangovers lol. & they're Vietnamese coffee is YUM! & gives you that extra energy. The shrimp spring rolls are also good"}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.  Here lies my meager attempt to find some good pho.  I can't go too long without some, and strangely enough, it seems to be a rarity near me.  They seem to specialize in Chinese food, but all I was interested in was the Vietnamese.  Hard to screw up pho for me.  All it needs is the right ingredients and just take a hot minute to get to me.  I'll probably blame the usual clientele for the limited pho selection, but I have also seen worse.  This is the first time I've seen tendon pho all by itself; usually it's along side tripe and other meats.  This could have been very disappointing as I don't typically see a lot of tendon in pho, but no, they were generous here.  On the other hand, for an establishment that prides itself on fresh ingredients (even says so on the menu), their condiments were far from such.  The lime, basil, and sprouts looked far older than I cared to guess.  I drowned them in the hot broth before I decided they might be unappetizing -- except the sprouts as they were just too far gone.  Maybe if they hadn't called so much attention to their ingredients, I would have been more lenient.  Noodles and broth were sufficient in quantity and quality.  Here's a little story: I had a tad too much sun earlier that day and was quite burnt.  I know: strange that I would want hot pho after being sunburnt, but I just had to have it.  They had the plus of being an all Asian staff; I almost prefer it when there was a language barrier to overcome -- typically a sign of authenticity.  And I found some of that with the waitress.  Now there was one exchange that I just wasn't understanding, but after a bit of back-and-forth, turns out she was asking me if I was drunk because of my red face.  While funny at the moment, it sadly once again made me think of what kind of clientele they have to put up with to require that kind of question.  At least she was nice about it.  Another interesting note was the television had a soccer game on in Spanish.  This was a first for me in an Asian establishment, and I'll have to be forgiven for asking about it.  Turns out the owner himself likes it and speaks it.  Supposedly the regulars expect nothing less.  It was these experiences more than the pho that might make me return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend mentions his craving for their orange chicken everyday when we pass by driving home. My favorite is the crab rangoons. They had a special buy an order of rangoons, get one free, so we got a total of 12 and I polished off the majority of them. They're always really friendly! And don't forget to put some of their boba balls in your mouth, sho good."}
{"text":"Not too many Vietnamese/Chinese place in NLV. This is my go to when I don't wanna make the drive out. It does the job. Good food. Cheap prices. :)"}
{"text":"Great eggplant/tofu. Large portions. Very nice counter ladies- the younger one has it more together. I like that they have Perrier which I rarely find anywhere. They gave us free soda & appetizer with our order. It's nice inside for what looks like a take out place- stay clear of huge plant if you wish to see the tv ..lol."}
{"text":"the food quality is not consistent. the wait is oh so looooonnnggg, every single time. once, i called in my order and gave them 45 minutes to prepare my food, and when i arrived at the restaurant, i waited another 20 minutes. and while i paid as soon as i got there, i was asked by staff if i had already paid before handing me my food. today will be the last time i set my foot here, because you made me wait again...oh jasmine express, you keep breaking my heart!"}
{"text":"This is my first review but felt the need to post.  Used groupon so gave them a 3 star for the value.  Like groupon and they generally work out good for me.  Ordered S&S pork and Kung Po Chicken both were just OK.  Fried rice also meh to ok.  Red sauce/sweet? came with the order but had some kind of burnt pieces floating around in it, not sure if that is the way it was suppose to be but I've never seen it before.  Crab Rangoon-way over cooked wontons-filling was OK but skimmpy.  Tempura Shrimp-skinny, dry and hard-close to inedible.  Veg Egg rolls-inedible-had to throw away.  I am not a picky eater but literally could not bite thru the egg rolls.  Sorry will not be back.  Maybe the Pho food is better."}
{"text":"Better pho than that other place in north town and I love boba smoothies, saves me a drive to china town."}
{"text":"I wasnt a big fan of pho...but this place changed my mind. I USUALLY just drive here but it can be a hassle finding seats since it is small, but now they do online ordering and delivery. Wayyy more convenient for me. I definately recommend the smoothies and the pho...coconut and pineapple is my fav!!!"}
{"text":"I got a txt from this location saying I got 10% off I told the guy regarding to txt and rudely told me that they will stop that  soon. I been coming for this place every  for the buy 2 get 1 free boba. It took 20 mins to make my boba when I'm the only customer during at that time, trying to get one of the guys attention but got ignored til the lady saw me and told me  that the machine is not hot enough for the boba cup to be sealed."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this location when my gf was under the weather and needed some hot pho to help her feel better. Its a small hole-in-the-wall place right in between Vons and Subway. As I entered in I was greeted by the only server there, Chris. As I was going through the menu for take-out (which is really nice because most of the dishes have pictures) I was noticing Chris' customer service and he was well knowledgeable and very customer friendly. I ordered the Plain noodle pho, Pan fry beef vermicelli, and special combo rice plate which came with 3 eggrolls, shrimp, and grilled pork. Now before I tell you how bomb the food was, I must pause for a little constructive criticism. If you plan on doing a take-out, call in AT LEAST 15-20 min before hand. I seriously waited for 30-35 minutes while sitting down with my back against the glass entrance wall where the waiting seats are with the Sun beaming on my back. A lady to the right of me that came in a little later than I asked me if I called in before or placed an order when I came in because she said she called in 20 min before and has been waiting for 45 MIN - AN HOUR. -which is ridiculous for any restaurant especially when there's very little ppl. Did I mention the sun is beaming down on our backs? I knew I should have gotten that thai tea...lol. The lady also said that the total ambiance of the place changed but the food was always good. That being said, THE FOOD WAS BOMB. Great proportions and decent prices. The Food was actually fresh! -Definitely something you want when ordering from an oriental/asian restaurant with all the seafood and vegetables they utilize.   Great/Fresh food. Great customer service. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars is simply because with just a few arrangements the restaurant can look a lot nicer, And the wait time for take-out was long! Especially with the chairs against the glass entrance wall. But the Food was great and worth the wait. WHEW...lol"}
{"text":"Their food is made fresh as soon as you order!  Therefore if you are wanting fast Chinese food like China a gogo or Panda Express which tastes like junk, don't come here. The wait is worth it here! I call my order in, even if I'm going to eat in the restaurant about 10-15 minutes before I arrive to give them a chance to have it ready or get my order in before others.  Their Chicken Noodle Pho Soup is delicious!!!! I eat it at least once a week! The only reason I give them 4 stars is because about 4 times out of 40 plus visits that I've order the Pho soup they must have ran out of cilantro and instead of getting more or informing you that they are out (what is Pho Soup without cilantro??) they just pack it up without and you are disappointed when you get home. At least you could stop and buy your own if they let you know they ran out.  That's my only complaint and that's very minimal for the amount of times I have had their Pho."}
{"text":"we visited first time for to go food. Being vegetarian order spring roll, Mix vegg and it was horrible. we would never ever recommend this restaurant to any of our friends and family. Food quality was so down, vegetables were not at all fresh. Spring oil with oil and have no idea what they stuff.   There is no zero star otherwise could have given \"zero star\""}
{"text":"Horrible place... Sat there for ten minutes, without anyone taking our order, or even saying hi..."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place....I love the salt & pepper tofu, and vermicelli dishes. The egg rolls are absolutely amazing! The boba drinks are great too...I make it a point to frequent Jasmine Express!"}
{"text":"I had eaten here in 2014 and it was an experience... thought i would give it another as maybe they were having a bad day.  I had the BBQ pork vermicelli (it tasted old) pork was chewy and fatty wasn't impressed same experience i had before! dinning room and bathroom was also dirty again. wont be back for a third time."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for the past 2 years. The food was good then but I don't know what happened? The food had gotten worst! Even that...food was AWEFUL! I ordered some Vietnamese food that I've been normally ordering. Today, the looks and taste of it is totally different. The salt and pepper shrimp that is supposed to be fantastic was very very oily and soggy. The Vietnamese spring roll with shrimp was smelly and yucky, ended up not eating it. The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce was so over cooked and it was floating in its sauce. The fried rice was dark brown, it was overloaded with soy sauce.  I  complain about it but they did not even offer to exchange it or make a new one. Not even an apology for this AWEFUL meal.   Jasmine Express you are done in my book! And for all of you out there who wants to try....Don't! You will be very disappointed!  AWEFUL..AWEFUL...AWEFUL !!!! BAD FOOD...consider this as a warning! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I keep trying this place cause I liked the pho and combo egg rolls. But everything else wasn't good.  Pad Thai was awful and pink. Tried the mango and sticky rice twice both times took one bite and tossed. Wasn't sweet at all. Tried Thai curry and that wasn't Thai curry. No coconut milk ,potatoes or carrots. So I will no longer stray from the 2 things I like. Oh and I like the teas"}
{"text":"I love their salt and pepper pork chops! Of course they are way greasy but they taste soooo good!"}
{"text":"I recommend if you're going to do a pick up, it's fast and simple when I order through eat24, I only order their fried rice or chow fun, which I say is excellent and portions are great for you and another! Can't say about dining in, since I've haven't done it."}
{"text":"First time experience here. Got there at 8:30 pm on a Wednesday night. The place was empty, no customers. Told the server we wanted to eat for dine-in but was told that they close at 9pm and was just staring like he wanted nothing from us. Walked out without even trying their food. No remorse, no apologies from the host. Just pure laziness. The sign on the front said they close at 930 and yelp hours say they close at 10pm.   Tip for future customers: if you want to dine-in, don't go at 830 if they close at 930 because really, they close at 9 and your service will be refused.  Really wanted to try their food and would've ordered to-go but based on that performance, I was incredibly disappointed in their customer service. Never going back again."}
{"text":"So the boba here is good, depending on who makes it. The food is hit or miss depending on what time of day you get it. I usually get Pad Thai here and sometimes it's fantastic, sometimes you wonder what the hell they put in it. Needless to say, I got food poisoning this last time around so I think I'll just stick to the boba. Other than that, the staff is pretty cool. It'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Pretty chill place. Good for the money! Also, there's a lot of specials that include free food or drinks.  Buy 2 Thai teas, get the third free.  Etc. Awesome."}
{"text":"Two nights in a row had issues ordering online.  First, they said they were slammed for St. Patrick's day and asked if I could come pick it up.  Second night, they said that the coupon I used from their online site wasn't valid.  When I asked when they were getting it fixed, the person who called rudely told me they had fixed it already.  When I told me that I had used it and gotten the coupon from the site, I was told I was wrong and that I ordered the wrong thing.  Then, they started making all these excuses as to why the are having issues, something about a server...So if you want to eat there, you'll have to go there in person."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here, but we bought boba smoothies, and they were fantastic! Tons of choices!  Start at $3.50 - 5.75  fresh!"}
{"text":"So I found this place via the EAT24 app as I have two young kids and taking them anywhere is just a joke at this point. So I haven't been into the actual restaurant but I have ordered delivery a half a dozen times. I have one word for the food.. PHO!! I might have a slight addiction to asian noodle soup and theres is exceptionally good! Ive had it 4 times this week and will probably be getting it again tomorrow! I also ordered the Pad Thai and it was pretty good. About a 3 out of 5 for the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"soo addicting!!!! I live in Henderson and I went here because my cousin lives in N.las vegas and told me about this place. I love the beef combination pho soup!!! Sooo bomb! They said no msg...hmmm...but still soo good! I am craving for more at the moment. Restaurant is clean and friendly staff, and also tried the chow mein which was very tasty as well!!! 5stars!"}
{"text":"It was my first time using the Yelp app with my credit card. I was a little skeptical however I tried it because yelp is a good app. Wow, it worked out perfect for me. I went up to the counter and said my food was prepaid and they said go ahead have a seat it's all taken care of. I  did get there a couple minutes early and just wait a couple of minutes until the pick up time that was described on yelp. They were on time and the food is always delicious and the portions were great. The soup was great everything was great. While I was waiting there was A group of people in the corner near the window. The people looked like they were having a great time enjoying the food. Someone had taken them there and it seem to be their first time. The guys were very happy with the food and they even had to take some home because they couldn't finish it. The place is small but very inviting, it reminds me of the places in the bay area also the food as well. It's very hard to find a good Chinese place here in Las Vegas when you're from the bay area and Chinatown is right on the way. I did check in there when I got there however I did not receive my free vegetable eggrolls, I believe you have to tell them that you are checked in and that you are on yelp to receive them. I did receive my buy one get one free potsticker order however which is perfectly fine. I really don't to much care for vegetable eggrolls however with my order it came with them and they were very good. The best for egg rolls were very crispy and they were not greasy I had some the next day and they were still crispy even though I microwaved them wow. I was satisfied with the whole order thank you very much yelp and thank you very much to this restaurant I will come again, and again."}
{"text":"Really loved all the food here until the last time my family and I ate there. As we were eating at one of the tables, we saw a roach crawl across the floor. And where there is one, there are more."}
{"text":"You know you've ordered from a place too many times when you walk through the door and the owner shouts your name and address.  But we can't help it. My husband and I love Jasmine Express. The chicken wings are crispy and served on a bed of shredded cabbage and sliced Serrano peppers. Little bits of chicken skin fall to the bottom of the pile, and the  resultant mix is even better than the actual wings.  The Singapore noodles have a complex melange of flavors that make me want to read Dune and whisper \"the spice...!\" between mouthfuls.   The potstickers are equally delightful, as are the cream cheese wontons. Fried rice fans should try the basil fried rice. Better yet, order it extra spicy.  They even have Boba tea - my favorite is the lychee.  Unlike the previous reviewer, we've always had fast service here. Deliveries arrive hot in less than 30 minutes, and take out orders are even faster."}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Best smoothies, so yummy! Hubby and I ordered our fav orange chicken with fried rice."}
{"text":"Three solid stars for the taste of the food alone. Chicken pad thai was a bit on the sweet side for me but noodles were cooked perfectly and portions were huge. The pork pad se eww...hands down one of the best dishes like this that I have had. I could have eaten this for days. The meat was hearty and there was plenty of it. I will return for the food.   They also have smoothies and boba here. The avacado smoothie was sooooo yummy! Get one!   I could have gone one more star but we waited for 25 min for a to go order...we were the only people in there. The chef made out order wrong and we had to wait longer. In that time I noticed the place could use a deep clean...it's also not in a great part of north Las Vegas so the sidewalk foot traffic was a bit sketchy.   Check in on yelp and get 2 free veggie rolls!!"}
{"text":"The same Chinese food you will find in any clone Chinese takeout joint. It serves a purpose if you are broke or drunk, and little else. Heavy on the deep fryer and sugary sauce, light on quality. Although it may have been an isolated incident, the one time I ordered delivery, they quoted me a half hour and it ended up being well over an hour."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week for my lunch break. They have lunch specials from 11am-3pm ranging from $6-$8, but I come here for the Combination Pho. I think it's the best dish they offer. This is probably the only place that serves Pho on this side of town.  Call ahead to order your food, because they take a long time."}
{"text":"Good Pho, Thai ice tea with boba buy 2 get one free.....doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"I was craving phad Thai, and decided to give this place a try, bad idea! The cashier/waiter charged me for an a la cart price instead of their lunch special, when I pointed it out he gave an attitude, (it may only be a buck and some change difference) but he should've been apologetic about the little mistake. Bad customer service!  The wait was also too slow, they had fans on and the door propped open. I guess their exhaust and air wasn't working."}
{"text":"This place is reliable and tasty. Pad Thai is my fave. I also like their boba options. Im glad a place like this is on this side of town. Service is brisk and cold, which makes me feel like I'm inconveniencing them or something. Maybe it's a cultural difference. I'll still going though! Can't pass up the food and boba."}
{"text":"Great pho and customer service also love that I can order online! Thai iced tea is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great food good location the Pho here is good but not the best if I'm in the area and I want asian food. Nice  little cafe appeal and serve a lot of different asian meals"}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner. As we walked in, we were not greeted. I grabbed a menu and we sat down at a table. With a check in on Yelp, you get two free vegetable egg rolls. Cool!   The young guy working the front gave us waters and gave us a while to decide on what to get on the menu. We started with some egg rolls mixed meat. Those were delicious as well as the vegetable ones. I start off with a lychee green tea no boba. I did not want to fill up on boba. The lychee green tea was delicious! They have lunch specials that end at 4 pm. We got there at 3:30. Just in time. I decided on chicken tempura with fried rice. The chicken tempura was good. Chicken dipped in tempura batter. So juicy and crunchy at the same time. It came with the dipping sauce which tasted like soy sauce. So good. The fried rice was good with some pieces of egg and lots of soy sauce which made the rice tasty. I love some good fried rice!   Service was great by our young waiter. He cleared our table as soon as we were done with our plates. It seems as if people come here more for the boba drinks! So good and they have so many flavors."}
{"text":"This place is horrible the pha Thai taste like shit never getting pha Thai from here the Mochi tasted old the stuff is rude never coming back"}
{"text":"A decent Chinese resturaunt i must say. Food was good and came out very presentable. The hostess barely speaks English so its hard to explain a specialty order and hard to understand her coversation but she's very nice.  The building was very clean with spacious seating. There's one t.v. to watch and I'm sure you could arrange to have the channel changed to whatever you like.   Not too expensive due to have a lunch special. Very chill and relaxing and did I mention how good the food is? Lol  I ordered the kung pao chicken which was amazing!! A bit spicy but I expected it to be. Not stingy with the chicken and evened out with vegitables.  Overall, the place is amazing and is proud to have Yelpers eat the restaurant because they have a big sign at the register that thanks fellow reviewers such as you & I.  Will definitely be eating here again soon."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese ever! My wife loves the Hot and Sour soup and orders it regulally, they now know her and treat her very well, sometimes with fried rice and other times with spring rolls. It is always amazing!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night and I didn't understand how \"check in \" works to get 2 free egg rolls but the staff was very nice and showed me how this yelp app works! ! The egg rolls were  great and I got curry puffs for the first time ever instead of my usual fallback crab Rangoon and they were Amazing! !!! 7 stars really. . I am hooked.  Even my dogs loved them.. the crunchy and then the sweet /tart.. big hit in the house.. I also got egg fried rice. Great too.. sorry no photos was too hungry and only remembered that I should have snapped a photo after there was only crumbs left.. will be back a lot!!!! Very nice and friendly staff Don't forget to check in for 2 free egg rolls as well you won't want to miss those.  I can't wait to go back for the Curry fried rice, ..salt and pepper Calamari. .coconut noodles. ..spicy lemongrass chicken. .and Kung pao peanut chicken are all on my to do list!!!! 10 stars if I could. ."}
{"text":"Not really a sit down restaurant but great if your looking for Boba tea to go. They have lots of flavors to choose from. Food is still good."}
{"text":"They have the worst pho I've ever had! If you want pho better go to Chinatown. Their seafood pho sucks monkey balls a million times. Their shrimp in the seafood pho taste old, rubbery, and is just nasty. I do not recommend it at all. The noodles are hard. Service was bad. Just don't ever get pho here!!"}
{"text":"When I found out there was a place that sold pho near by I was excited. I usually drive all the way to lake mead and the 95 to get pho so I'm so glad this place is close to where I live besides China town. When I got there, there was a few people already waiting and only one guy in front. I got the combination pho and I did have to wait quit a bit but I didn't mind especially since the obvious lack of staff. Not the absolute best pho I've ever had but it was good enough for me to come back. The broth was tasty but not very enriched with the smell of the spices you usually smell. Overall food not bad. Also their website says they open at 10:30am and their door says 11:00 fri-sat. I got there at 11:22am and the guy opened the doors at 11:30 so they probably should be more consistent..."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Ate some great Chinese food.  Getting boba as well.  Service is awesome!  Crab rangoons and Szechuan eggplant always yummy!  Their pho here is great too.  Good price and big portions.  Oh and finishing off with the snow cream.  Love that stuff!"}
{"text":"Got a stomach bug after eating here due to undercooked chicken,  I will no longer be visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there with cousin and the food was very good and tasty. The server with the glasses came to our table within 2 mins of seating. He was very nice and professional. I would definitely return for other great items on the menu"}
{"text":"My spouse visited Vietnam many times for work, and he needed nice Pho for his sore throat. Googled it and got this location and tried for the first time as dine in last weekend. Visited dinner time and atmosphere is like a cafeteria but the food was great.  We ordered the set menu, it was $30 including 2 entrees (ordered Pho and sesame chicken that were so good and got to know where to go from the next time when we need them), appetizer (too much fried and came in dark brown, but we didn't say anything), any soup we chose Wonton soup (came out beautiful with their home-made wontons and the soup was great, couldn't finish all, had to come home with them)  Chef at the kitchen seemed an old Vietnamese men who knows how to cook. Pho was wonderful and the sesame chicken was properly fried and coated with sweet and sour sauce.   And the server was nice and friendly for us unlike other reviewer and quick to get us what we needed.   We recommend this restaurant to whoever wants to try good pho!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed. Ordered this for a date night in and when we got it everything looked delicious. However after a couple bites we actually ended up throwing everything away and going to pick up Wendy's. The wrappers on the vegetable egg rolls was so thick and not crispy at all I actually had a hard time chewing and the \"vegetables\" inside were all brown-no other colors at all.   I also got pad Thai and it tasted like nothing-just hot bland noodles lacking flavor. My husband got the shrimp kabobs and some chicken wings and he did not like his at all. It was just not good all around."}
{"text":"We just ordered takeout from this place. We were a little weary about it but we really enjoyed the food. You get a lot of food for the price and the boba drinks were super good, they only have one size cup and it's pretty big. They also had the best egg rolls I've ever had !"}
{"text":"Probably has to be one of the worst sit-down restaurant experiences I've ever had. The service is overlook-able. i ordered the beef noodle pho. The broth itself is pretty bland and felt like a chore to eat. It was a herbal beef broth with a slight sweet taste to it. Nothing special. The noodles were alright and the vegetables (Bean sprouts, cilantro, onion; the lime was a little dry) were fresh.   The bad rating comes from the beef. The actual beef muscle was okay but the beef tendon tasted pretty spoiled. I've eaten soups, including herbal soups with beef tendon. That did not come close to the weird nasty taste this tendon had. Quite overpriced as well. Better/similar prices in other locations. Would recommend New China Cuisine right across the street. Kinda similar but at least the beef was decent quality and the portions are great."}
{"text":"We were desperate for pho but didnt want to drive to china town or even lead mead/215 so we chanced it on this place since it was close by.   First time we had it, my wife brought it home. It was decent but decided it wasnt fair to rate them on it.   Couple weeks later we decide to dine in. We wait 10-15 minutes for the waiter. And another 15 min for our food. The pho was definitely better but not worth the wait. Chow mein noodles were watery and tasteless.   Service was friendly but still very bad.   Oh, and they water down their hoisin sauce. Why? So they can have more bang for the buck. My grandpa used to do that with our ketchup bottles! Gross!!!  Definitely do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I sit here on a quick break from work, waiting for my online order of five drinks. They didn't bother to actually read my prepaid order, so made completely wrong drinks. Without apologizing when I pointed it out, they then proceeded to make the drinks of the people that came in AFTER me, then finally made my correct order. Again with zero apology. Meanwhile I'm late getting back to work, and will never order from there again. A five minute trip turned into twenty minutes. Not ok."}
{"text":"If a negative review was possible, I would give this restaurant one! Coming from out of town, I wanted to try this place out. MAN!!!!!!! That was a BIG MISTAKE! I found it convenient and order the food through yelp and set the food to be picked up at 7:30 pm. I received a voice message from a rude employee at 7:17 pm, informing me my food was ready to be picked up, but yet, I set the pick up at 7:30! I called the restaurant back and the rude employee answered. I explained, I would be there shortly. Upon arrival, the rude idiot asked me \"why you late fo yo pick up?!?!?\" I replied, \"my order was set at 7:30, to pick up!\" He answered back \"well..... We make it at 7:00\" (pointless stupid coment) while he was explaining, he looked to the detailed invoice of my order and circled the time its set to be picked up and said \"see it say seven.......... Oh?\" Immediately, the employee felt completely DUMB! Instead of apologizing, the employee blatantly covered his IGNORANCE for arrogance! I asked \"well.... Dont you think the food is cold by now?\" In his immediate defense, he pointlessly started check marking specific foods on the invoice of items I ordered, on what items would be warm or not (AGAIN, stupidity at its best!) I would of accepted his apology and went about my night, but since this moron was spitting pointless nonsense-full verbiage, to make him look more dumber than he really is! This made me immensely frustrated and was seriously considering throwing the food in his face. I arrived to North LV, from a long drive from Californian and all I wanted to do was eat. This person is the face of this establishment and SHOULD really consider pulling the stick out of his ass, for the customers and business sake. Over all, the food was ok and nothing out of the ordinary. YELPERS, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BUSINESS. If you dont mind being treated rude and would consider mundane food; that would be totally up to you!"}
{"text":"I have given this place chance after chance. I don't know why they have the elderly man still making the food. I have nothing against him personally and give him respect for trying, but it's clearly time to retire. The food is HORRIBLE! I order two orders of Egg Foo Young for me and my friend. That was $25 down the drain because neither of us ate more than 1 of the 4 patties it came with! It was the WORST EFY we have both ever eaten. I feel bad because it was my idea to go there! I will NEVER give this place my money again!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all. When I walked in I had to peak around their counter to get someone's attention to realize I was in the store at 12:45 pm in the afternoon. Then I only ordered 2 boxes of \"white\" rice to go and it took almost 10 minutes...wow!!!  Not planning on coming back as it was not friendly nor did it appear that clean.."}
{"text":"I was very hopeful and excited about going to Jasmines. Upon entry, my excitement changed when i was seated. The restaurant was filthy, the menus were so sticky that i literally had to pry the pages apart, yeah disgusting. Then it took a long time just to get my appitizers. The silver wear and soup spoons looked like a biohazard. When i finally got my main dish Pho, the bean sprouts were slimy, brownish/black. I literally almost ran out of the restaurant, but the waiter brought some fresh bean sprouts. I was so traumatized by the lack of cleanliness and rotten food that i couldn't eat my food. I would HIGHLY suggest to NEVER dine here. I'm sure they have failed multiple health inspections.  Zero stars"}
{"text":"It's a bit of a wait but well worth it!  Tamarind-Pineapple, not really so unusual; don't be fooled, think sweet and sour in a broth.  I'm a long-time fan of vegetable soups and this one is right up there with the best; although this one is fruitier than most with sliced pineapple, tomato, and okra and tamarind flavor.  The service was attentive and the food was fresh and tasty. Thank you. Buen Apetito!"}
{"text":"Awesome place they make your food when you order bobas here are awesome great place for lunch"}
{"text":"Went for dinner around 6pm on a Friday. The pho is pretty good loaded with brisket and meat, peppered beef was alright and the Hong Kong noodles Tate's as what you would get anywhere in China town.   They were very short staffed with one person serving and ringing up pick up orders. Food took longer than normal.   Tip. Order take out so you don't have to wait 45 min to an hour for your food. Overall cleanliness for this place is about a 5."}
{"text":"Closest pho from my house.. Not as good as the ones close to china town but it'll do! Waiter is always friendly and service is quick. But if u want pho in north Vegas this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch there today and I ordered szcuan beef and the meat and rice were old and I took my food back and they didn't want to refund my money so I decieded to warn every one."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and boba!!! Love it, soooo many to pick from. Deals with Thai tee all the time and ragoons/potstickers."}
{"text":"A - ok  with me!!!  Oh my what a feast of food........  clean, fresh, and great customer service. all of their vegetables are fresh, well everything.  I had crab ragoons, bok choy, rice, and vermacelli noodles......chicken,...salad......o man i wish i could remember the name of the meal!!!! soooooooo gooood......bye, going to lunch getting hungry thing\king about it."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has over a 3 star rating.  The yellow curry tasted like something out of a horror movie not to mention they forgot to bring the rice.  The pad thai was terribly unauthentic and lacking flavor or excitement.   The pad kee mao even my kids wouldn't eat and I don't blame them.  The noodles were overly rubbery and felt like they were over cooked."}
{"text":"I keep hoping that it will get better. It hasn't. The food truly lacks flavor & the service is \"slow as the dickens\"!"}
{"text":"I really don't like leaving bad reviews, but this place didn't do it for me. I went in to place an order to go and ended up waiting almost an hour for the food. I don't mind the wait, seeing as I usually make friends or find ways to distract myself, it was the food itself that disappointed me. I placed an order of Tom yum chicken soup, combination pho, and Vietnamese egg rolls. Not too hard. Yet they made many mistakes. They made the soup Tom yum soup with shrimp instead of chicken. When I told them that it had to be chicken I felt as if the person was frustrated with me by not taking what they had given me. Then after receiving the new order with the chicken soup, I walked out, only to realize that they forgot to put the egg rolls. I walked back in and he apologized and added two extra egg rolls for the bother. I left semi content and ready to finally eat, yet when I opened the bag I noticed they had forgotten the sauces for the pho (siracha and hoisin sauce). I could have survived without them, however what did piss me off was the chicken soup. My boyfriend tried it and the chicken was so chewy, almost raw! I mean I waited so long for this soup to be done twice and expected it to be good only for the soup to be completely inedible and throwing it away. I don't know if I will be back any time soon. Maybe for their boba. It looked fresh. My advice would be check your order when you receive it. It seems that they are prone to making mistakes. On the plus side the egg rolls were decent."}
{"text":"I had to come here to change my review. Thai tea was still amazing but that doesn't matter to me after my latest experiences. I signed up for their reward card and loyalty program. Buy 9 get the 10th boba drink free. I reached my 10th drink in less than 10 days. I was there religiously. The service became so disgusting as time went on. Cashiers had an attitude all the time but I ignored it b/c I loved the tea. I go to cash in my \"loyalty\" card and 3 employees have a conversation about the card for a minute (in their language I don't understand). Finally they honor THEIR card. If that wasn't enough I noticed the boba just sitting there completely uncovered. I will never grace them with my presence again. Customer service is paramount to me & they clearly don't get that. Don't waste your money on these people. I'll drive 30 minutes across town before I support businesses like this."}
{"text":"They have special offer for boba but they added some extra fees and it's not cheap after all. One time I came there, only ordered 1 thai green boba, it only took like 2 mins to make but they made me wait 15 mins and restaurant was empty. Today I came again and ordered 3 thai green. I waited 20 mins and they made it wrong! Bad service. Won't come back again..."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. When I first started eating here like a year ago it was great, then they started getting sloppy with their food and now they are just bad all over. A plate is no longer the same size as before, placed an order for pick up and they didn't began making it til I got there and paid, and I specifically asked for NO sesame seeds in my chow mein and the guy said ok but I get my chow mein and it has sesame seeds. Never going back again. Such a shame, it was so good before."}
{"text":"While I personally wish that the restaurant had a nicer decor and tables/chairs, that's the only fault I've had with this place. The quality of the food as well as the price are wonderful.  You can't get asian food this good in North Las Vegas from any of their nearby competitors."}
{"text":"Loved the pineapple fried rice! Scrimp was huge.   Just as good as Sanam's but no wait time!"}
{"text":"First and last visit to eat. Food was awful - canned mushrooms, questionable water chestnuts, mushy rice!  Pad Thai mediocre. Spring rolls eh. Only saving grace were the boba drinks. Overwhelming grease smell (stuck in my clothes!)."}
{"text":"The best way I can describe this place is that it's a Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese fusion type of restaurant. You can get Chow Mein, Pad Thai, or Pho.   My wife shared a bowl of beef pho with my youngest son. My oldest son got the pork vermicelli bowl. I got the lunch special which came with hot or iced tea, eggflower soup, an eggroll, fried rice, and entrée of your choice from a list. I chose sweet n sour pork.   The beef pho was good. Since we ordered it plain, for my youngest, it was just like chicken noodle soup but with beef instead. The vermicelli was ok. Nothing to rave about. Now my lunch special was pretty good. They give you a nice bowl of eggflower soup. I chose iced tea for my drink. I think it was jasmine. It was very strong. If you refer to my pic, the fried rice that came with my sweet n sour pork was very good. The eggroll I think was a combination pork and vegetable. I would say it was a good deal for 6 bucks.  Service was ok. We were taken care of by one server. Even though the place was a bit busy, we got our food in a timely manner. It just took a while to get our refills a couple times.  Some random info: 2 free eggrolls on check in. Free wifi. Password is express7. Lunch specials are everyday from 11 am to 4 pm. Don't forget about the various boba drinks you can order. Apparently a lot of people come here just for those drinks! When we were eating our meal, at least 4 people came in just for those drinks alone! So it must be good. Next time we will try one.

{"text":"Food if garbage and took FOREVER to get to my house. The drive had to call me to let me know that they were still waiting for our food to be done. When it was just soup and an entree. I could have drove to the strip. Parked, went out to eat somewhere, ate then drive back home before it got to my house. And I live right around the corner!"}
{"text":"Here I go again.  I get a craving for Pho soup and don't feel like driving across town to Spring  Mountain, so I ordered take out at Jasmine Express.  Big mistake.  I notice the windows were so dirty on the restaurant, that I wondered about the kitchen.  I had to wait for me order and seen a dead cockroach on the floor and flies all over the place.  This is Vegas, we don't have problems with flies due to the heat.  When I got home with my soup my container was only 1/2 filled with broth.  The onion and bean sprouts were brown and old.   After adding my own onions and bean sprouts, I wonder when the last time the health department was in for inspection.  I highly recommend eating at your own risk when visiting this restaurant.  It is a hole in the ground and get worse everytime I visit."}
{"text":"Just doing a review for the drinks! Buy 2 Thai Tea/Golden Milk Tea get 1 Free! Plus when you check in you get 2 free eggrolls. The man at the cash register was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome place for pho ! Special combination is good,  but there serving is  not consistent sometimes you get a big portion then next time you get a sad face  :( but this is the only restaurant that serves pho in my area . Service is excellent ! Hope  This information is useful :)"}
{"text":"Overall we really liked the food. We started with yummy crab Rangoon to share, then I had the Singapore rice noodles which was nice & spicy. My husband had cashew chicken and it was also great. I do have to say after we took a table in the sit down part of the restaurant, we noticed 2 of the tables had food & drinks leftover from the last customers & they didn't get bused until we were paying our check & leaving. Also while we were eating, we overheard the girl taking the orders over the phone had apologized to 2 different callers for having delivered the wrong food. So I would suggest to come in & order take out rather than order delivery. Hopefully the next time we go, the tables will be bused. Overall the food came out quickly & tasted great but the service could use some work. We gave it an 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Pho. I saw they had it from the pictures. Andrea was quick to tell what they had since I didn't have a menu.  Our order was ready for pick up when promised. I like that they pack everything separate and you put it together yourself. Can't wait to go back and try other items."}
{"text":"They have Boba! that alone gives them 5 stars! Finally a good boba place in north las Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Yep, I'm a fan! My friend and I drove past this restaurant once and one day decided to give it a shot... She got beef and broccoli and I got beef and green pepper. Beef and green pepper is pretty much just like beef pepper steak. It was only a 15 minute wait, so we went next door to smiths to grab some wine and kill time. After reading reviews, I'm curious as to what 'pho' is and how it tastes... that might be the next thing I try!"}
{"text":"Since we live far from China Town , this is the closest place for Pha.. I was surprise to find it fresh n tasty .. I am happy with my new discovery spot and would highly recommend it to friends ."}
{"text":"3.5 stars at least. We were really disappointed after driving far from the strip and see this hole in the wall place. However, the food was delicious! Maybe our expectation are just not high enough? And huge portions as well. Variety also plentiful."}
{"text":"Jasmine express is our closest go-to pho restaurant. We like the pho and pan fried noodles but we did not like their Chinese menu items. Overall I give them 4 stars specially now that the air conditioning is working again."}
{"text":"The Food is great, the service is slow & the  a/c doesn't work. An it's been that way for a while. I think they need to go the Food Network & have restaurant makeover!"}
{"text":"Got to love the Spring Rolls and Strawberry smoothie with boba.    The first time I went here, is with the wife.  Since she saw the reviews were very good.  So trusting the yelpers out there, I decided to tag along.  I was kind of skeptical since it was next to a Smith grocery store and a Subway.  It is a decent size place to eat at.  The inside looks nicely decorated and the staff seems really nice.  The seating arrangement was kind of tight in a sense, but we were able to sit and eat in.    I usually have my spring rolls, and they were really good.  I really like their Strawberry smoothie.   I had their teriyaki Bowl, which was good, and decent.  The wife had the Pho and thought it was okay.    My overall thoughts, I would come here for the spring rolls.  But dining in, is okay, but probably during the off time, like after lunch or before dinner.  So if you're in the area, you should try it."}
{"text":"We have ordered here a few times and there food has been great.  We ordered food on 11/1/2013 and the chicken we ordered was so bad.  I called to tell them about how awful the chicken was and the man on the phone was extremely rude.  All I wanted them to do was refund the money or make us a new order of the chicken!!  He kept saying well no one else has complained.  Really????  I am a customer who is telling you part of my meal was bad and you could not just fix the problem, instead the man kept putting me on hold and coming back on the line and getting louder and ruder.  I will never recommend anyone here EVER!"}
{"text":"Updating my review based on my last few visits and orders. The food is good, that's really their saving grace, they try to have customer service, but they are lacking. I understand that they are a family owned business and may not have enough manpower from time to time. On my last visit however, I had to wait an hour for 2 entrees and 4 milk teas. To make matters worst, I didn't even get an apology from them when I got my food. I am still debating on my 3 star rating for them,  but I really had to pull back my 4 star rating."}
{"text":"I'm very conflicted with this place. The food is great, this is the only Pho place close by and that is somewhat decent. Rare Steak Pho is really delicious when I don't want to drive across time for my favorite place.  The service here is usually awful. I've waited for half an hour for a to go order when I have had people come after me get their order quicker.  I have never dined in, but from the look and the wait I witnessed it wasn't all that great. One time they had a woman who seemed almost completely new trying to work the register by herself and taking 8 minutes to ring up an order, she had to grab a cook's help to finish it out.  The regular guy I see that takes orders can be a bit rude. I've been placed on hold for over ten minutes with him to then have to call back.  I have also ordered to go some Pho and Fried Rice, literally he said 'not a problem, we are out of pho since over half an hour.' How is this not a problem?  I also always order my Pho without bean sprouts, he has questioned me as if why I would ever do such a thing and then time after time there are always bean sprouts.  But yet I keep coming back because it is close and pretty good food. They definitely need better help though."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was awful.   The beef vermicelli tasted like the meat had gone bad.  I threw it out and cooked instead. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, cooked to order and the portions are generous for the price. We ordered the Shrimp Egg Foo Young and egg rolls. Myself, my husband and three year old son ate two meals from the one order.   The only downside was that it took close to 45 mins for our order to be prepared. The food was worth the wait.   So it's best to call in your order a head of time."}
{"text":"Yea I went there 3 times on Thursday with my brother, then I went my cousin & my goddaughter Emma Saturday, then Monday this evening I went with my cousin, her husband & my goddaughter again. I love Jasmine Express. I like the Chow Mein & the pork yummy yummy."}
{"text":"I feel terrible giving them 3 stars, since the waiter was over the top amazing! The food however, wasn't 'bad' , but my husband ordered basil chicken and I ordered another chicken dish ... And they both had the exact same and so did the chicken lettuce wraps.  :( The Tum Yum was spicy, with not much flavor. Bummer, as I live right down the street and have been dying to find a good Thai place close by."}
{"text":"I have been ordering through them for postmates. I generally order the Pho and vermicelli noodles. Both have always been good. There was just one instance I felt that they delivered me really old broth for the Pho, so I am hoping that does not happen anymore."}
{"text":"By far the best chinese I have had!  I love chinese food but most places I go upset my stomach as well as my husband's.  This place seemed fresh, not too greasy, and super delicious!  I prefer fried rice but I must admit I love the fluffiness of this white rice.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant clean.  Most definitely my new go-to place for chinese cuisine!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch, and had the hargow, salt & pepper calamari, and beef stew noodle.  Service was fairly fast, and the food was great!  The portions for the beef stew noodle and salt & pepper calamari were huge!  Had to take home.  Will be going back to try other items on menu."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a Chinese food fan, but I've been craving it like crazy lately! We had an excellent experience this past week at Jasmine Express. Any place that delivers is a plus in my book... especially when it arrives much before the said time and is delicious & piping hot! We had beef broccoli, house fried rice, & the walnut shrimp. All of them were fantastic. I have a new found love for walnut shrimp, AMAZING! The only down side was they said they didn't have brown rice which I did see on the menu. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"It is ridiculous how long you have to wait for a chicken teriyaki bowl ... Like 45 minute wait time when theres no one in the lobby ? Plus the guy that took our order was so rude , when we tried to add something to the order he was like \"what do you want\" terrible service and the bowl was \"ok\" teriyaki maddness next time smh"}
{"text":"Do not request your order for delivery. Took us almost 2 hours to get our food and we are still waiting. Very disappointing! We called to find out what's going on, someone picked up, then hung up on us. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Service was good, place was clean. The food menu has great selection but i will say the taste is ok but \"HANDS DOWN\" to their pho soup!!! worth of a drive if you're in the north side & craving for pho soup noodles . Will be back only for that."}
{"text":"The fried rice is pretty good (we always ask for no peas no carrots and more bean sprouts and green onions).   I would also recommend the szechuan chicken and walnut shrimp."}
{"text":"I have only visited for the drinks. I have tried various flavors and have found them all taste good! My favorite is the melon dew. Only complaint is that it's always a 10 min wait just for two drinks."}
{"text":"Good food despite their sanitary issues first time I tried was pretty good food. Now I live too far so can't get food from this place."}
{"text":"It's actually unfortunate that I have to give them 1 star, because the food is actually very good.....but the service....... The service is just absolutely mediocre. This used to be one of my favorite go-to lunch spots when I worked around the corner.... But the attitudes from the workers and poor service have me questioning if the good food is worth it. The straw that broke the camels back was tonight when I came to pick up food and use my five stars app (an app that give you points and free stuff if you frequent a restaurant often)..... They basically said all I could use it for was my boba tea and even though I had enough points to get a free entree.... He'd prefer to give me two boba teas instead. I'm like really with all the money I've spent here, you would 'prefer' to give me some cheap boba instead of what the coupon is valued for. I can tell my business is not appreciated here..... I'm tired of the side eyes if I ask for chop sticks or an extra soy sauce. I'm down."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Pho was really good. Fresh veggies and grilled shrimp. Pad Thai and black pepper steak was disappointing. I'd go back for more pho but that's about it."}
{"text":"Food was greasy. It was hot in there and service was ok. Food was alright. I give them ONE whopping \"bleh\" star and ANOTHER as a thank you for the free egg roll upon checking-in through Yelp. :-p"}
{"text":"My client suggested eating here because he was in the mood for pho and his friends dine here often.  He has never had Pho and decides to eat it.  I love pho but not on a damn hot day so I had the Curry chicken (didn't care for it).  Too much rice and not enough chicken. The curry was weak sauce. My girlfriend had the Shrimp asparagus  Which she liked.  I ordered the Spring rolls as a side item but didn't care for it. They had too much noodles and not enough shrimp plus the rice paper was too tough.  We got 2 free vegetable egg rolls for checking in on Yelp. That was good. My client liked the egg rolls. He likes anything fried really."}
{"text":"This restaurant rates. #1 on the worst Chinese fast food list in the country. I have lived in many places and in many states and this \"restaurant\" is the worst.   We ordered Crab Rangoon & General Tso chicken. The crab rangoon was very small, overcooked and had a smear of who knows what in it. The General Tso chicken had something that resembled paint thinner and smelled like it too. The chicken was the cheapest quality a restaurant could buy. For fear of spending the weekend in the hospital I stuck to the overcooked crab rangoon and some rice. I was desperate!  If you have the iron stomach and complete lack of taste buds to try the food here you might want to avoid the duck sauce. That was nastier than the paint thinner, er the chicken."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Service is always poor at best. Showed up today at 9:18 with a party of 7. They said they are closing soon so we would have to take the food to go. I guess 40 minutes isn't enough time to bring out soup. Needless to say, I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I pass by this place all the time as I frequent the shopping center. We finally went in the other day and it was excellent. Don't let the \"hole in the wall\" location convince you to pass it up. So good!"}
{"text":"The combination Pho is amazing, the price is on point. I have returned time and time again. Love it"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here.  I can customize menu items to my taste.  They have a wide variety of smoothies, teas, and juices and have a reasonably quick turn around time.  The restaurant has a nice family vibe."}
{"text":"Not worth it if you're going for Thai food.   Boba is okay, egg rolls... decent, but the Pad Thai is abominable.   The noodles were dry, too thin, and resembled angel hair pasta. Lacked and flavor or zest, very disappointing.   The Panang curry was better at least, but overly salty.   It also took me wayyy too long to get my food and I had called in ahead. Was waiting 30+ min for an order I had placed over the phone.  Oh, and don't even bother ordering the egg drop soup. It looks fluorescent yellow and tastes like onion soup that had an omlette dumped in it as an after thought.  Not returning here again. If you stumble here and are dying of starvation just stick to the boba. You won't regret that as much."}
{"text":"The fried rice was amazing! I also ordered the orange chicken and that was really good too. Although I want to try everything on the menu I at least know what my favorite dishes are from here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Whenever I'd have a craving for pho or boba this would be MY spot to go. Especially since it is closer to my house than having to drive all the way to China Town.   I came here a couple days ago with my family. My dad likes their duck here so we tried calling a half hour in advance to place an order. My mom was put on hold for a few minutes but the entire conversation we could hear between the man and his customer. She ended up hanging up and we couldn't connect back with the restaurant for at least 20 mins. By that time we had already arrived in front of the restaurant. We ordered the food via phone still. We did a little food shopping because we were told our food would be about a 20 min wait. Once time had passed and we sat at our table, we actually had to wait about another 20 mins for our food. We had ordered half a duck, Hong Kong noodles w/chicken, General Tso's chicken and a Special Combination Pho, and only water for each of us. We were never asked if we wanted refills on our water once we had first sat down and other than when our meals were given to us he never came back to check on us. I don't understand why it would take so long. Other times I've been here my food would be out 10-15 mins after ordering. I wonder where the the waiter Eddie is? He was always great with his customer service and was always very attentive. Now the people here don't even say hi or greet you. The food wasn't very hot when brought to us but it was good.   I came back to this restaurant today because I've been on this teriyaki chicken bowl or bbq beef feen for awhile so I thought why not try the special that they advertise on the window. The combo includes teriyaki chicken with veggies, rice, crab rangoons and a milk tea. I ordered that and made the milk tea a honey dew. I wish he had asked if I wanted to replace the regular milk tea with honey dew when I ordered cuz it was an extra $3.75. So I got a milk tea with the meal and an extra Honey Dew milk tea. I thought I could choose the flavor for some reason, my mistake. I ordered chicken fried rice also because it's Monday and it's on special. I've always liked their chicken fried rice anyway. I ordered for take out. It took 10 mins for my two drinks to be brought out to me and half an hour to get my food. Mind you it was only two items. He didn't even say anything when he gave me my food. No...\"Have a nice day\" or Thank You!\" Disappointing.   The bowl itself was ok, chicken was a bit salty. A lot of rice, not enough chicken, veggies or sauce. I personally don't like my teriyaki bowls to be drenched in sauce anyway but this needed a bit more to it. The fried rice was good as usual though. The Honeydew milk tea tasted a little weird but that might be because I'm not used to it but the regular milk tea was good.   I'm not usually disappointed but the food quality has gone down some and the customer service isn't what it used to be.   I'm not going to say I won't be dining here but I'm not going to go here as my first choice anymore."}
{"text":"We just left and got diarrhea the mangolian was raw and the tea pot was dirty hubby found a hair in his food not coming here again"}
{"text":"I was craving pho so I ordered the well cooked beef pho for delivery. It was very bland and quite disappointing. The broth was put in a separate to-go cup from the veggies and meat so nothing had flavor. My boyfriend ordered the General Tsao's chicken and said it tastes better at other places. The egg roll was good but that's pretty hard to mess up. All in all, I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Despite ordering ahead of time, I had to wait for my food when I got there. However I think it was worth the wait. I ordered the shrimp pho. The broth was separated from the other stuff which meant I got a lot of broth! The shrimp were huge! It also came with noodles, jalapeños, red and white onions, limes, and bean sprouts. Chili paste and hoisin sauce were also included in the bag. It was convenient and close by and tasted pretty good. Would go back for a to go order."}
{"text":"Yay, bobaaaa! :) I've become addicted to boba and I've been looking for places open later in the day since I get off work late.  I had seen Jasmine Express on Yelp a few times but was afraid they didn't have enough choices for drinks for me. Finally, we decided to come here. My boyfriend was hungry and I wanted boba. I read reviews and everyone talked about how amazing the Thai tea was so I decided to get one.  For food, my boyfriend got a vermicelli dish and I got vegetable pad Thai. Delicious but I took most of it home. Same with my boyfriend! The only thing we really couldn't stop eating was the curry puffs. Soooooo effin good, I couldn't stop myself.  We ended up taking a milk tea and a Thai tea home since they are buy 2, get 1 free. The milk tea definitely tastes a little flowery but I liked it. Overall, very happy with the prices and quality."}
{"text":"I came in on a Thursday at 11 for lunch. Service was horrible. The main guy seemed out of it and took about 7 minutes to get me water and take my order. Then I got half of the lunch special about 10 minutes later. I was missing the soup and egg roll. The waiter never came back to check despite asking for the check when I got the food. I finally had to go up to the counter because I needed to be back for work and the server had never come back. They did give me a discount which is good Food wise - not bad. I had the shrimp with veggies and was pleased. The fried rice was soaked in soy sauce and wasn't my favorite. The Thai tea - the main thing I came for was horrible. It was WAY too sweet and they had no boba.  Perhaps I went too early. I would try this place again but would probably call in my order and carry out. I hoping their food continues to be decent so I have a good Asian place near me but I don't know I they'll be worth the hassle and the wait."}
{"text":"Just had lunch for the very first time here. I can't believe I'm about to leave Vegas in a few months and have been here since '09 and have never eaten here.  I had the shrimp pork vermicelli and my wife had the lemon chicken. Both were excellent. When you come here you must try the Boba Strawberry Smoothie! Great prices and nice portions, will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"First time here, better than I thought. A+++++ no complaints here. Will be a regular for my pho fix!"}
{"text":"The customer service was awesome.   They give you free crab rangoon with each order of pot stickers. i didn't know that!   Thank god, they deliver! They delivered less than estimated time, which is a plus!  Their boba slush is alright. This isn't the best oriental cuisine I've had, but it was satisfying. Good food.   Crab fried rice however is awesome."}
{"text":"Jasmine's tofu spring rolls are just one of the best dishes in the restaurant. Simply for this reason it is prepared with nurturing love and care to satisfy any customer that is placing an order for this specific item on the menu. The customer is sure to enjoy the time and the effort that is taking to prepare this meal and it is sure to satisfy anyone who orders it.  John and Judy Aka...Cinnamin"}
{"text":"You know a place is not doing so well when they offer deals that are too good to be true. Free eggroll with yelp check-in and buy one get one free drink? We paid less than $10 and ended up with 2 drinks and a box of eggroll.   SERVICE I was disgusted by the rude servers here. They seemed nice at first but as soon as they saw me check-in on yelp, they kept demanding me to write a review for them. No.  I sat down at one of their sticky and nasty table then they yelled out \"you write review? I need to see it\" When I went to the counter to pick up my order, they snatched my phone from my hands and started scrolling through my yelp profile. \"where is the review? you didn't write it? omg no why\" First of all, you have no right to touch my belonging and second of all, it's invasion of my privacy for you to be looking through my phone. I am done with their trashy and unprofessional employees.   FOOD/DRINKS I don't know what their vegetable eggroll was made out of but it was inedible. Straight to trash.   Boba milk tea? or did they mistake this for sugar milk tea? perhaps they added a whole bag of sugar in my 24oz milk tea because I didn't write a review? Either way, I could not drink this. I went home, dumped half of the milk tea, added water and I was finally able to drink this. Took a sip then went straight to trash.  Boba was a disgusting mush and had absolutely no flavor or chew.  CONCLUSION  Never again. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese delivery as far as Vegas goes. Haven't found something GREAT yet, but this is my #1 delivery for now. They were very friendly and I asked about military discount and they gave me 10% off the order. Food was pretty good. Definitely Americanized :p"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed eating lunch at this place many times. UNTIL my last visit. I sat down for lunch and just started to enjoy my soup. I noticed an ant on my knee and squished it thinking nothing of it, then I noticed the floor which had hundreds of ants which were feeding on a piece of fortune cookie. I brought to the lady's attention and had a guy come out to take care of it. I simply moved to another table. He had a trash can, a broom and dust pan. He swept them up, put them in a trash can which he then placed behind the counter. REALLY!?!? The ants aren't dead now you just got them closer to the kitchen. I mentioned that to him but he didn't care. As he was mopping the floor where they used to be, he hit the planter and two American cockroaches came running out. That was it, I was done because they probably have German roaches in the kitchen. I have not been there since. I like the food but I am concerned about the cleanliness of the place.   NOTE: I am in pest control, however I do not service restaurants because I enjoy eating out. But they use no one and they should. Hopefully they do now."}
{"text":"I was sooooo disappointed with my experience all the way around...  We ordered online for delivery and it took about an hour and a half before they knocked at the door....The delivery site is something to be desired as it's not user-friendly.  Then, at the end, the \"delivery fee\" (not tip) went up from 3.00 to 5.00...not sure what the deal was there. I guess the upside is that the delivery woman was at least nice...but then again, I don't think it would've been a good idea to NOT be and it took an hour and a half *shrug*...suggestion, DON'T add the tip to your order if you pay with a CC, do cash, as we -pre-tipped really well and it bit us in the bottom.  Ordered quite a variety so we could get a feel for the place, plus we were STARVING:  -Vegetable eggrolls- very greasy, not unusual for eggrolls so *shrug*  -salt and pepper wings- deep fried and super tiny, like pigeon-wing tiny. Nothing special about them whatsoever...and considering how long it took before we got our order, they were pretty stale on arrival  -hot and sour soup- it was so \"gelatin-y\" and didn't taste good. I\"ve had better at the walk-up places at mall food courts. I poured it out  -Pad Thai- just tasteless and dry  -Cashew Chicken- another \"gelatin-y\" dish. Nothing to \"write home about\" even if I write about it on Yelp :)   -BBQ fried rice- looked like it was cooked in a really dirty wok, and it didn't taste good either. Tasted like old grease with chunks of dried-up pork in it  We spent a good 50.00, but regretted it. Would've done better to just get up off the couch and drive to Panda, considering the poor quality JE gave us  I doubt seriously that I would eat there (or from there) again and, not to be mean, but I wouldn't tell anyone I know to eat there either."}
{"text":"I'm very excited that I found this place! North LV is not exactly known for excellent Asian cuisine.  I actually stumbled upon this place by sheer accident  (or lazyness, i'll let you be the judge of that).  the day i ran into this place, i was feeling tired and under the weather. All I really wanted was some comfort food, some Tinola with rice and some fish sauce :) (tinola ~ vegetable, ginger, soupy strew, usually made with chicken) but the only way i was going to get that is if i made it myself, so i headed to smith's. once i got there i changed my mind, and decided i was so not in the mood to cook at all, but that was not gong to fix my hunger issues. so i walked into jasmine express, and was pleasantly surprised to see pho on the menu. Of course that is exactly what I got and it was actually very good!  Besides Vietnamese food, i was very excited to discover that they offer Thai food as well. It's about time!!  They have some decent pad Thai, pad si ew, and thai tea boba.  Needless to say I am over the moon that finally found a place so close to me, that serves Asian cuisine other than Chinese and Japanese and is really good.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"X     For fast food  Never Again !!!  Everything was over cooked and burnt .. Tasted Awful Service was fast , but nor friendly .."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a while but this past experience just called it quits for me. I'm willing to make that drive further to have better customer service. Call in a order if your wanting to eat here. There was only a couple eating when we arrived and 2 people waiting on their to go order. You have to ask for a refill on water. You get told that it normally takes long to receive your food. Short staffed? One person out front and 3 in the back of kitchen. I don't eat my food until everyone gets their food. My food would of been cold if I had waited till the last plate came. I've just read over the poor comments to this place recently and I'm not surprised. I've seen this place busier and ran better months ago. Don't know what happened to this place."}
{"text":"Have sampled several teas with boba or jelly - and love them all! So yummy.   We eat here like once a week. Everything we've tried on the menu is good. Solid fried rice, great starters like egg rolls and pot stickers. Sauces are authentic and flavorful.  Every entree I've had is delicious, including the tofu. Lunch and dinner specials available on the weekend. Consistently good food. Use yelp check in, check signs for buy one get one's, and download the epoxy app to earn freebies."}
{"text":"If you want pho.... Don't get it here. Staff is friendly and helpful but food is not up to par. Tastes like the broth was made from bouillon cubes."}
{"text":"I really like Jasmine Express. I usually order the family meal as the best bang for our buck. I first came here in around 2001 when I first moved to El Dorado. I REALLY liked it when they used to make their orange chicken from scratch. It was way better than it is now and what Panda was putting out. I stopped by tonight and was very happy with what I received to the point of me wanting to write a review and put Jasmine Express back into my fast-food rotation.  To me their food tastes better than other offerings in the area. I like how Roger T. describes their menu as a mix between Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese. I gave four stars instead of five because when I went in to pick up my phone ordered food, the counter person chose to clear tables in an empty restaurant first and had me wait till he was done before ringing up my food which was sitting on the counter waiting for me. Meaning this restaurant needs to improve on its customer service in order to get better reviews.  As far as bugs, I have never seen any here but I've seen mice running around a Jack In The Box (not the one in this shopping center) and had a roach IN my food at another popular chinese restaurant. That was a no-go. My point is there are rodents, rats and roaches all over this desert town we call Vegas. Don't be fooled. Keep your eyes open."}
{"text":"Food was great...  One plate is enough for two to eat and the pho rare steak soup very good.. Area clean ....."}
{"text":"I'm from phila and I'm use to good food so when I find a place that blows me away I couldn't resist doing this. I lived in vegas for 20 years but most of my life was in phila. I tried Jasmine Express for the first time the other day and it was great. I ordered the orange chicken which had so much chicken inside and the flavor was Great. I tried a new dish to me called Hor Fun which is a noodle dish and this also was fantastic. The Fried rice is up there with the best Fried Rice I ever had in phila and for sure the best one in Las Vegas.. I'm not sure about you, but It's not easy if your use to great food as I was living in philadelphia most of my life to find a place here in Las Vegas that really gets your attention but this place did and even though I don't write reviews I had to give this place its due. It made a steady customer out of me..Name is Neil and thanks Jasmine Express for being there."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE JASMINE EXPRESS they have the best drink menu and they have really good ice cream sandwich macaroon hybrids. So good love this place"}
{"text":"Very misleading and disappointing! My family and I have been coming to this place for years! It seems tho that the restaurant has either changed owners or cook. Today's visit was due to a certificate of $10 I got from restaurants. com. Food was bad last time I came (about a month ago) but I decided to give it another chance. Unfortunately it was worse this time. I Un-wrapped the utensils from the enclosed napkin and got a dirty used fork! My parents orded the Kao pao chicken and i ordered the chicken chow main.  When the food came, the rice was hard like it wasn't even cooked. When I asked for the bill and showed my  restaurants.com certificate for $10, they only creditedy bill for $9.19. When I questioned the amount the server said \"Yea, everyone knows that.\" Well NO. When you buy a certificate for a certain amount, you expect the business to credit the full advertised amount. Just a bad experience over all. I have I e more $10 certificate left and to be honest, I feel like throwing it away. No sense to going back for bad food And false advertising."}

I'm not sure who the guy was working behind the counter but he suggested  I try their dinner special rock crab with salt and pepper for $14.00This had to be on of the best dishes I ever eaten! The portions was huge,If I was back in jersey and or something like this it would have cost more line $25. This was the best $14 I ever spent!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week and we were VERY happy with everything we tried.  We ordered egg fried rice, veggie egg foo young, shiu mai, chicken noodle soup, won ton soup and pepper steak.  Seriously, everything was really very good!  The soups especially were a great surprise....all the noodles were the homemade long egg noodles.  Yummo!    As the previous reviewer stated, the service does take a little longer than your normal take out place, but it's well worth the wait.    The service is outstanding and everyone was very friendly.    I highly recommend Jasmine Express!!!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of Chinese restaurants around here.  Unfortunately they all kind of taste the same.  The food here was good, but nothing stood out as extraordinary."}
{"text":"We come a lot here but they had changed their hours from 11am to 12pm for opening. It's 1225pm and no one has showed up..not only did they lose customers but they show no consideration for their customers to at least put a sign up if they are not opening! Finding another pho place that will appreciate us."}
{"text":"I ordered the strawberry smoothie with boba and it was delicious! I have had smoothies other places and it is high on my list. The smoothie was blended well; I did not have any big chunks of ice like you find at some places and the flavor was consistent throughout.   I also ordered the veggie egg rolls to go along with the smoothie for a quick lunch. The egg rolls were crispy and I like the sauce, but they are pretty much the *industry standard* egg rolls. The price was fair and a nice cold treat on a hot day. I did not call ahead and everything was ready in about 5 minutes."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Chinese food anymore, especially with delivery. This place got the job done. Did it blow my mind? Eh, not really, but it had some high points.  I found the chicken fried rice totally awesome. Just salty enough, great flavor, really good.  The sweet n' sour chicken was good, but they should consider putting the sauce on the side when doing delivery. It was very soggy, so I ended up pulling off the outsides and just eating the middle.  The lo mein would've been good -- the chicken in it was white meat and cooked well - but the noodles were way overcooked (again, likely due to the delivery time), so they were mush. And I though it was a little bland.  The pork wontons I really liked. My boyfriend didn't like them as much because he really likes those kinds that are just a big fried noodle with a tiny dot of meat in the middle. These have more meat, but are still quite good, in my opinion.  The crab rangoon was... average. Cooked well, tasted fine. I'd order those again, but they weren't a stand-out, really.  The steamed rice was cooked well and not mushy or underdone.  The whole thing, including delivery tip was $40 or so, not too bad and they were right on time -- 30 minutes.  I'd order from here again, though I might try some other items that won't sog-out, preferably something with vegetables!"}
{"text":"Had the pho today to go and it was delicious.  Everything was packed nicely and was still warm when I got home."}
{"text":"First off I'm not the type of person who wants to give restaurants a bad review, I like to leave my remarks.   First time trying Jasmin Express Cuisine, and I'm very sorry to say I AM DISAPPOINTED.  Went there ordered my food, the guy named Chris said it would be ready in 15 minutes but I was there for 45.  I ordered Veggies Fried Rice, Fried Tofu, and Tom Ka Chicken...  My Wife is a Vegetarian so she eats tofu to substitute meat, out off all the restaurants we have ordered tofu from...this order was just nasty. Very very, and I mean VERY soggy. The Veggie Fried Rice tasted like shit, and on top of that they failed to mention that the Tom Ka Chicken was a soup..it was separated to the \"soup\" section.  And one more thing, the guy Chris not to give an insult but loosen up kid... your too nervous. Instead of saying \"hey, hey you\" ask people for their names for they're order I promise it'll be easier on you.  Never eating here again, Golden Phoenix is waaaay better and quality."}
{"text":"Great fried rice and the pad thai is even better!!! My munchies stop!!!! Omg and the boba selection!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get pho however recently when I've been getting it delivered something is always off. One time the limes were old and the broth wasn't up to par. Obviously was a bad batch but this time was the last straw! They put pho in a big styrofoam soda cup which is totally fine, perfect serving, but the top was a soda cup top with the hole in it so naturally when it's being delivered it has the possibility of getting knocked over and spill a little bit but half of my pho was spilled in the bag with the spicy sauce melted in the plastic container with the broth.This would not have happened if they put it in their usual container. I'm very unhappy with this service today!"}
{"text":"They have boba milk teas here in North Las vegas.   Eddie was excellent cashier. Bogo on milk teas and smoothies (:"}
{"text":"Wow..I got my Pho to go. Rare beef,  with all the trimmings. The broth was hot and amazing even when I got home. The veggies were very fresh and everything was very good."}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service & long wait times. Avoid if possible, if not I Hope you have better luck than I did."}
{"text":"We went based on the reviews and we were pleasantly surprised. We only tried the combo pho and the combo vermicelli, but they were both good. My husband liked the ice coffee too. The service and variety were fine. The food is better near Chinatown, but that doesn't mean this place wasn't good for what we had. I do think the AC needs to be turned up. Good Vietnamese food near Aliante."}
{"text":"This place had high stars on Postmates and I needed Thai food... extremely disappointed.  6 dollars for the worst, cheapest spring rolls I have ever eaten... literally. Check out the photo of them.   I also got my favorite Tom Ka soup.. definitely the most lacking Tom kha I've ever had.   I wish i had more to say, this is probably the most vague review I've ever posted, but I'm currently just meh.. I'd rather drive 15 minutes and get Thai to go rather than order from here again."}
{"text":"this place is a joke... I came in and ordered 2 smoothies and they made me wait 25 minutes for 2 drinks... they gave us a straw that had sticky substance on it... WTF. it was expensive for no reason and the smoothies weren't even tasty. NEVER COMING BACK."}
{"text":"I was excited about this restaurant because I could get a bowl of pho without having to drive across town. The pho is good but the service is terrible. Delivery time is over an hour so I decided to pick up the next time. I ordered two pho and 1 order of egg rolls. I left my house 10 minutes after I ordered thinking it would be ready by the time I drove up there. But I was wrong. When I got there not only was my order not ready. I don't even think she put it in. Also she told me that there was only enough pho for one order something she could have told me over the phone before I drove up there. So I waited in there hot restaurant for another twenty minute just to receive half my order. I was not offered anything for free to make up for their mistake."}
{"text":"The service is good. My friends and I come here often because we live around the area. I regularly order the Mongolian Beef, Combination Pho and Szechuan Beef; all good tasting. I like that they give 2 free vegetable rolls. Sad that they discontinued the Rambutan flavored drinks."}
{"text":"This place has great food! Szchuan chicken and eggplant are my favorites. It's always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"We got takeout from Jasmine Express about a week ago. It was decent, but not incredible. The Mongolian Beef was very good, the dumplings and fried rice were okay, and the Orange Chicken was just meh (didn't even taste \"orangey\" at all). I would recommend JE, however, my wife and I actually prefer New China Cuisine which is right across the street. Overall their food is better and they do combo family meals which helps keep the price down a bit compared to JE."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Jasmine Express because I'm a huge boba fan. Unfortunately this place seems to be a bit sub-par.   The first time that me and my fiancee went here, we got two of the specialty boba drinks, both off of their \"favorites\" listed on the wall.   Anyone familiar with boba knows the difference between normal, fresh boba & boba that's started to break down because it's been sitting too long. Our boba balls seemed to be the latter.   My fiance's milk tea had a somewhat soapy flavor, and he didn't even finish it.  We chalked it up to a bad day at the restaurant. We gave the place another shot a few weeks later.  We tried to play it safe this time by just getting Thai tea with boba, and while it was okay, it was definitely some sort of pre-mix. There was no color differentiation from liquid creamer, so I suspect it was powdered creamer. You could taste something was off.   While we were sitting waiting for our tea, we saw a sign that said free Thai tea with order of crab ragoons (or something small like that, I don't remember specifically). It would have been much cheaper for us to order that way, as the food item was a few dollars less than a Thai tea by itself was, but our cashier said nothing about this deal when we were ordering.   Overall I'm pretty disappointed in Jasmine Express. Hope I can find a good boba place soon here!"}
{"text":"Hot and sour soup is very bitter. It is almost like it is made of pure sour. Food is decent. My husband enjoyed the rice. It was mediocre Chinese food."}
{"text":"Good food lots of choices for boba tea. The service was very good the only thing I was not sure about was I ordered chicken pho and my wife ordered rare steak but the broth was the same and I am not use to that. Thou it was good pho. We will definitely be back soon. The stamp discount is great as well."}
{"text":"Two stars bcs the place and Food was decent. But I found two strand of hair in my spring rolls :( come on guys"}
{"text":"Come here frequently oxtail soup is amazing great teas as well, a definite must is the fried rice one of my favorite places to get it from! And all the staff is very friendly and helpful as well!"}
{"text":"We have ordered here about four times, and enjoyed the large quantities of food and the delivery option. They also deliver boba which is a plus. The price can be a bit high however for what you are getting.   We had pretty good results the first three times we went, I would have given it 4 stars on a normal day.   This is however the last time that we will be ordering from them. Though the food may normally be ok, the bad service we revived today has put a stop to it.   Today we were having a date night and relaxing at home after a hectic week. We ordered our food, and it arrived an hour later like normal. We were eager to get to our food. The wife ordered a curry and I ordered the beef and peppers. I asked for extra spicy, it wasn't spicy, but worse things happen, I guess I'm used to this by now. The biggest problem is that the meat in my wife's curry was white and cut thin. Almost light tan. Much different from the brown and hearty beef in my meal, and even different from last 2 weeks when she ordered it. We don't normally call an establishment, but this time we tried. My wife doesn't like pork so her meal was pretty much inedible to her. The man who answered the phone said, \"don't worry, that's beef. Your wife is just confused. Eat it, you will see it is just beef and it will be tasty. \" After we told him it wasn't tasty and we weren't happy with it, there was no attempt whatsoever to try to fix it. He sat there awkwardly on the phone waiting for me to change my mind and accept that the pork was beef. I told him that if there was nothing they could do, that we would not order from here again.   Either they messed up and didn't want to own up to it, or they changed their recipe in the last week, and it's no longer tasty. Either way we are done with this place. We will stick to Thai Basil down the street."}
{"text":"After wanting to get some good quality viet food but being to lazy to drive to China town, my wife and I decided to check this place out. First impression was ugly decor, poor ventilation, and the fruits in the storage looked like they were rotting. But that has never stopped me from eating good quality food, so we went ahead and sat down. My wife was happy when she they had a young coconut drink. Saw the dude pull it out of the rotting fruit section. I tried it and felt it was disgusting, my wife said it was good. Egg rolls were terrible, and I ordered the special combination vermicelli and my wife ordered the egg roll vermicelli. Long story short food was bland and not worth the price. I highly doubt we will ever visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend come all the time, since we moved. It's really close to our house and it has awesome boba and food! it also has a lot of choice and options :) yum"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for several years now and we just love this place. Their food is good and tasty and very affordable. I'm so glad that they started doing bobas now coz back then they didn't have it. Now they have tons of flavors to choose from. But my favorite here is the tofu salt & pepper, beef & broccoli, orange chicken, pho and so on. Everything is a must try except for pork coz we don't eat them. But come check it out. Big shout out to Chris for working so hard"}
{"text":"The drinks aren't that bad, but the wait time is ridiculous? 30 minutes for a boba drink. Come on!! They don't apologize or anything."}
{"text":"The food and service was not up to par last time we ate there it was great this time it was bad. We waited more than 20 minutes for someone to come and give us menus and take our order it took a long time to get drinks, hey gentleman walked in went to the counter waved sat down and was served his food before we even got our food and we have been there 20 minutes prior to him walking in. Do not eat the chili sauce we lifted the lid there was black mold we informed the waiter of the mold and he just took the container and moved to another table and nor did he ask us if we would like to have a fresh batch of chili sauce as for the food it was not up to par, not fresh and like I said the service suck. We know if we're going to ever go back again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few months now and Jasmine Express is still the best in Las Vegas compared to what China Town has to offer. The service is excellent. Chris and everyone who works here are really nice and treats the customers courteously."}
{"text":"By far the wost 40$ I've spent at an Asian restaurant. Came in ordered and everything was ready in ten minutes. The food tasted recooked, old,  mircowaved. Not worth what I paid. Will never come here again!! Totally gross. Panda Express is better and that's saying something because they have crappy food too."}
{"text":"The chicken tasted like rubber. We fought flies the whole time we ate! The worst! There wasn't anyone else there and yet it took 45 minutes to get our food. One person out of six in our party did like her food. She got  the beef."}
{"text":"We love this place ! I have never had a bad meal here . It's hands down the best pho in the area . The restaurant is always clean and staff is friendly . We got a delivery about a week ago and there were a few issues with it . I sent a message to the restaurant and immediately received a response . The owner was amazing . He not only refunded our order but when we went in there today he paid for our entire meal . Customer service like this is what restaurants  should strive for ! Thank you and we will be back !"}
{"text":"Their Vietnamese dishes are on point; vermicelli, pho, and rice plates. The smoothies are also on point. Everything else, from what I've tried; Chinese dishes (orange chicken, lemon chicken, shumai), Thai dishes (curry, pad thai), aren't all that great. The spring rolls, egg rolls, pork buns and sesame balls are pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"***I wish I could rate negative stars!***   Make sure to order ahead of time before coming to dine in or else you'll be waiting for one hour and a half! I was told it was normal to wait long during a \"rush!\" When we finally received our food, my chicken was cold!! The manager told me that he will replace my COLD food bc he is nice! The \"manager\" will also call you a liar! You won't have anything to drink for your entire meal! And to top things off he stood in my face and lied at the fact that people ordered ahead and that is why they served them first! Even though I proved him wrong by asking another customer in the place if they ordered ahead and was told no!! And he had nothing to say to that!    ****DO NOT EAT HERE!!****    Make the trip down to china town- it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I went back 3 days in a row trying different items. And the staff was awesome too.... funny guys :)  the boba green tea with kiwi is what has me. its awesome... thanks guys for the great food and service. See you again... :)"}
{"text":"My local Chinese spot never disappoints me... Good service (for a Chinese restaurant at least) fresh and fast I go at least 4x a month!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of confused by Jasmine Express. They're a Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai fusion type of place which makes ordering off the menu for delivery a little trying at best. I ordered steamed pork buns and I had envisioned the flaky bbq pork buns I've had at dim sum. These are not those buns. They're a bit more pasty and chewy in texture. I was a bit disappointed in that.  Their shrimp spring rolls are quite fresh and vibrant served with a side of peanut sauce. I find it a refreshingly light fair for the hot Vegas summers. Their fried rice could use some more flavor although it is already dark brown from the soy sauce but needing a kick of some sort. My order of General's chicken was extremely mild but on the upside it was overly breaded. It was nice big bites of chicken with very little breading. I'll just have to ask for it a bit spicier than I had ordered.  JE's vegetable egg rolls were nice and crispy. Mongolian beef was a good portion and tender. Next time I'll try a few different items as it seems their Chinese side of the menu is a bit week but their Vietnamese side is strong."}
{"text":"I like this place. There aren't a lot of good Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant choices up north- unless you're into the usual china-a-go-go type places. People are friendly and courteous and are more than happy to make any order cooked just the way you like it. The food is good too."}
{"text":"food is very good.  we dont have to run to china town anymore.  we were quite surprise.  I had pho and my wife had broccoli  beef.  wow it was so tasty and good."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with takeout here.  Mostly it was because the food was inexpensive and delicious...what's more to say!  Do yourself a favor and enjoy the Vietnamese spring rolls.  They are $4.95 for two huge rolls packed with cilantro, lettuce, and shrimp, served with yummy peanut sauce.  I have not yet found a place in Vegas that does a better job with true spring rolls--not the fried junk I see on bar menus."}
{"text":"The food is all good. Eveything Ive ordered is outrageous!  My fav is their Black Bean sauce. Anything with that sauce is the bomb!  Their Curry Shrimp fried rice is aweome too!  And another fav is their Honey Dew Kiwi Smoothie to die for..I keep coming here for their rice really..not many Chinese restaurants here make really good rice. For.me that is the key to good Chinese Cuisine!"}
{"text":"Came here today for some boba tea unfortunately they didn't have any made so I tried the kiwi pearls in my mango and strawberry smoothie...it was *bomb* I loved it. I still like boba but the pearls are yummy to. I give this place a 5 star and recommend you guys to try the smoothies with pearls. :)"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for Valentines day and they were packed and only one server working around the restaurant. We were seated promptly and it took awhile for the server to take our orders. The food came out late than expected. The food was delish and fresh so worth the wait. if you can't wait, panda express is right close by. the service was slower tonight but we were happy with the food."}
{"text":"Definitely a thumbs down. Seriously I'm not a picky eater at all. I'm usually the one that thinks everyone is crazy cause I think the food is good and everyone thinks it sucks. Not in this case!  First of all, their sign says hey open at 11am. I got there at 11:30 and their doors were locked but all signs said open. I thought I was retarded for a minute so I called and they just forgot to open the doors. I was seated by 11:36 (you just choose wherever) and was ready to order 2min later. The guy took 15 minutes to come & take my order! Then let me tell you how long I waited to get my food........ At 12:34pm!!!!!! Literally waited 1 whole hour for my food! And I was their only customer!! I was already frustrated but was expecting at least good food. Not the case! It didn't even look good! Had 2 bites and I was done! Not even my 1yr old that eats EVERYTHING wanted some.   So disappointed. Never ever again will I return. The only good thing was their Thai Tea Boba (really good actually) I guess that's where they get their 1 star. Besides that, save the trip and go else where!"}
{"text":"I showed up at 12:30 Tuesday September 8, the day after Labor Day, to a sign on the door saying they're closed for the holiday. It says they'll be open on Tuesday but they're not. Not a soul to be found; the door locked, the lights off...nothing. I totally understand being closed for the holiday. But if you put a sign up saying you'll be open Tuesday, be open or change the sign. I won't be returning to see how the food is."}
{"text":"Their beef and their shrimp are among the worst quality of food I've had yet to try.   Egg drop soup was also not good. The base of the soup is disgusting.   Golden milk tea boba was delicious."}
{"text":"What with the frequency I've been visiting Jasmine Express, I think it's time I updated my review from a 3 star rating to an improved 4 star rating. Jasmine Express is an Asian fusion restaurant located off Ann & Camino Al Norte in the large Smith's shopping center. So why the update? Jasmine's vegetarian pho ($7.65) nursed me back to health (I may be exaggerating) when I was sick with a persistent cold. When I find myself eating solo for dinner, I get huge portions of take-out food with a 5-7 minute wait time here. Plus, how awesome is that Yelp check-in offer for two free egg rolls with any purchase? I love those vegetable egg rolls!   Most importantly, ever since I've discovered Boba and Thai Tea, Jasmine Express has been instrumental in catering to my addictions. They're open until 10PM most days, which is the latest Boba shop you'll find open around these parts. They have a huge drink menu with tons of choices and varieties. My husband and I have tried the Thai Tea ($3.75), Taro Smoothie ($.4.25), and Mocha Tea Smoothie ($4.25). That mocha tea was unbelievably good! I've been feigning to try their mint chocolate smoothie next.    Heads up though - customer service needs some major improvements. Just know that before coming in. They're not very knowledgeable on menu items and don't speak much. I wouldn't recommend dining in because service is slow and it tends to be very warm inside. It's very take it or leave it. Regardless, I have to say I'm a fan of Jasmine Express!  UPDATE: Jasmine Express has a military discount! Yay!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #180"}
{"text":"WARNING: Stay away  from this place. we ate there a few times with no problems. this last time my wife found what turned out to be a piece of steel wool in her fried rice.!  took it back and showed it to the employee. he thought it was no big deal! he barely said sorry. needless to say i won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Groupon brought me here! The menu is extensive and they serve a lil bit of Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese entrees. I was craving Chinese this time and decided to give it a try; ordered pineapple fried rice (tasty, with 6-7 pcs of shrimp), sesame chicken (just ok), & combination vermicelli (good), all to go. We didn't have to wait too long (10 minutes).   The food is at least 3 stars (A-OK and I will come back). I'm already marking down what I'll try next. The staff were all friendly and helpful. They pointed out that they always have specials going on, whether it's $20 worth of food for $10 Groupon or 20-25% coupon on their website. Make sure you check in on your Yelp app so you get 2 free veggie egg rolls."}
{"text":"I went to this place today because I was craving shrimp fried rice. The decor was very nice there was a nice family there eating and the customer service was great ....however my rice was not what I really wanted the shrimp wasn't cooked along with the rice and it did not taste as good as I would have liked! So I pretty much left disappointed and I threw the 8 dollar rice in the trash ...but everything looked good! I'm always willing to give places a second chance! So I may be going back"}
{"text":"My boyfriend first discovered this hole in the wall because it was right next to Smiths, however it's an awesome thing he did because I LOVE the food there. I'm not big fan of Chinese food but this place changed my perception for the better. The lunch special that they have is really cheaper and you get a lot of bang for your buck. Depending on what main entrée you get it can range from $6.00 per plate to about $12.00, the meal includes soup of the day, the entrée, egg roll, and a huge helping of their amazing fried rice and the best part it actually comes with either iced/hot green tea with free refills. I personally like the basil chicken, it was large pieces of chicken as well as fresh vegetables.   I've tired many pho places and Jasmine Express has a legit broth which as you probably know with pho is a key element in the pho. I found it to be flavorful and I enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"This is really more of a 2 star rating...but given there are not too many options in North Las Vegas....relative to the area and the options available, it gets 3 stars.  It's pretty much a glorified panda express menu with some Thai/Vietnamese offerings.  We tried the Vietnamese food....the grilled pork&shrimp, egg rolls, rice option and the similar vermicelli bowl option. The meat was rather dry and slightly on the salty side.  The egg rolls were quite mediocre and flavorless inside.  The noodles were cooked well....We also tried the fried chicken wing appetizer...and they were tasty but perhaps that was due to the excessive use of MSG as seasoning...none the less it was crispy goodness but I probably drank 3 glasses of water after the appetizer.  Will I come back?  Perhaps....there are just those days when I'm too lazy to drive...."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat pho but didn't want to travel, this place popped up as closest to us. The Service was ok. Food not great. I ordered pho beef meatball and the noodles were overcooked and mushy. We probably won't be coming back here again. Taking the longer drive is worth it for better quality food."}
{"text":"This place has improved quite a bit since the last time I visited. I must say that their phô is just as good as the ones in china town. The portion size is good and the price is average. Definitely will be a place I will continue to go to for my phô cravings and Thai tea bobas!  Even bigger plus is that it's right in the north Las Vegas neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I always leave very disappointed.  I'm officially done with these people. Horrible service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"VERY DIRTY establishment. Potstickers were incredibly bland. Took one bite, complained to the MANAGER and was told I ordered it so I had to pay. I wasn't complaining to not pay. .ughh REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE. My husband and daughters food were mediocre at best. Never again."}
{"text":"The place I come to in North Las Vegas for the best Asian takeout.  The Vietnamese rolls and milk teas are the best."}
{"text":"Quick and easy meal. Rare beef pho had a ton of meat in it. Super flavorful. Only tip for improvement would be to serve soup a little hotter. It was like warm by the time I was done, which didn't take long because it was super tasty stuff!"}
{"text":"In the restaurant, there were two other tables occupied with 2 ppl each. My server came over to take my order, however I needed a little time since this was my first visit. During this time, 1 of the 2 tables emptied and I'm still waiting to place my order. I ordered hot tea and grilled chicken with rice noodles. I waited, and waited, and waited. Almost drank the whole pot of tea. Finally went to the counter and told them I wanted my order to go. I glanced back in the kitchen and there were two people (1 older female and male) besides my waiter. The lady who seemed to be doing most of the cooking was not wearing gloves and she plated someones food with her bare hands and then wiped her hands on her clothes. No one in the kitchen wore and apron, nor did I see hand or paper towels.  So that's another I will check off my list. My chicken wasn't half bad. Would just prefer more sanitary conditions."}
{"text":"The food is okay,its not the best food but it will do,I do really wish the place would follow their hours of operation,seems they open whenever they decide too get of bed as I have been there multiple times after they were suppose too be open,only too find the doors locked so I guess they are so rich they open whenever. the place is also rather dirty,I mean really dirty air vents,sticky tables and menus.Suggest too anyone just go some place else where you can actually eat instead of finding the doors locked all the time."}
{"text":"Well Shucks.  I wanted to like the local Chinese joint, but I was underwhelmed two times.  I had the basil chicken.  It just didn't taste very good - I really can't explain it.  The fried rice was real dark with nothing in it.    I can't remember what I got the second time I went... I did see crickets crawling around the floor both times I was there.  This is basically your typical local Chinese restaurant.  It is probably okay if you just want to stop by and get a quick cheap lunch."}
{"text":"So my gf family has been coming here for a few months now. & ive companied them a few times, this place is trash! I'm sorry, normally I wouldn't say that.. I feel bad because the cooks in the back are busting their butts trying to make of for the shitty service you get from the guy that is on his high horse every single time you go in there! Has an attitude, looks like he's always irritated with customers, & yells at his staff. Which makes me as a guest want to leave immediately, I can honestly say I left a $1.00 tip for that man... but asked for the girl in the back that was cooking and gave her $20. Its sad that the food is good, but hard for me to come here because of the guy you have to deal with to get the food! Smh"}
{"text":"This place is aweful. The chicken in the fried rice was dried out, like they left it out all day long and the rice was drenched in soy sauce. The Egg Rolls, there was no need for the fish sauce because they already  Reeked of them before I even open the sauce. And it tasted like day old fish. The BBQ Pork Buns were the only thing decent, but the filling was more than half pork fat. Their management did nothing about the complaint except offer a Bobba Tea on my next visit. I'm not going back and I would suggest you don't either. Super disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Asian restaurant in North Las Vegas. I don't want to drive to Chinatown just to eat."}
{"text":"Great food ! Great service !!  Highly recommended ! A must try. Convenient clean and friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"I get Jasmine Express at least twice a month and it is always my splurge I love vermicelli noodles and their noodle dishes just so delicious and I love that I don't have to go all the way to Chinatown to get such delicious spring rolls they're normally priced but I do spend quite a bit of money they're ordering spring rolls crab rangoons and their vermicelli noodles"}
{"text":"Where do I start... Coming into this establishment on a Sunday afternoon, they didn't have any customers seated just a bunch of other customers waiting for their boba order. I was starving and the employee seemed like he had a lot of his plate so I sat myself since I was dinning it. I was craving for a big piping hot bowl of pho. This was the only place open that was close to home. My usual pho place closes on Sunday... I tried this place a few years back.. so decided to try it again.   I ordered the combination pho, while my bf ordered the potstickers & Hong Kong crispy noodles w/ beef. We were both starving so I didn't have a chance to take a picture  of our food. The herbs that come w/ my Pho looked very old.... the Thai basil leaves were dark and the bean sprouts was brown. My Pho lacked flavor and tasted very watery. This is coming from an opinion of someone who eats Pho from various restaurants. It had a very very very faint taste of beef. I didn't finish my Pho. My boyfriend really enjoyed the potstickers though and it's sauce that came with. Although, the noodles was drenched in gravy so it was very very salty.    Customer service wasn't too great either. I asked for the BLUE Hawaiian sun iced tea in their fridge and the employee kept bringing me the wrong drink. He hardly checked up on us to see if we were ok and we had to seat ourselves. Keep in mind, it was a very slow day and we were the only customers seated.  The inside of the restaurant seemed filthy. There was food particles all over the floor, the tables were sticky, the condiment bottles had sauce all over them. Some tables still had dirty dishes.  Won't be returning..."}
{"text":"Fist time back in a longggg time! Ordered the pho. Must say it has improved big time! Is it new ownership?? I dunno but I like it and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times now and it's always great! They have very friendly service and great food! I've had the seafood pho both times and the aroma & flavor if the broth is the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Jasmine Express is a solid go to choice to satisfy the need for good Thai on the tastebuds. The menu is s mix of different Asian dishes, mainly Chinese and Thai. The wide variety of drinks are a nice draw, including milk teas and Boba.   I order Thai dishes here, mainly Pad Thai and Panang Curry. They offer full portions at a reasonable price. While I prefer spicier dishes, their medium I would consider mild, the flavor is still full and very satisfying.  I would recommend trying one of the lunch specials before ordering the full entrees to make sure the flavor profile is to your liking."}
{"text":"Walking in randomly I saw they had boba milk...it was an experience...it didn't taste right and to top it off the boba was still hard in the middle and it was full of ice...not worth the $4.05 if you ask me...could get one for a better price and with a better taste down the street..will not be going back.."}
{"text":"A year ago this place was GREAT. Now its a shithole with terrible customer service.  They upcharge once you arrive to pick up your food even though the online receipt includes the items.  The first time we figured it was a mistake, the second time in a row was unacceptable. We will never order food here again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have no idea why this place has so many negative reviews. So, if you're considering going here, but hesitant because of the reviews, I challenge you to try it. You won't regret it.   With that being said, as I pulled up to Jasmine Express, I was a little worried because of the cigar store next door. When I tried Viet Bistro at Tenaya and Lake Mead, it was disgusting because of the cigar smell. But anyways, as I walked in, I was greeted immediately. I ordered a milk tea boba and redeemed my free eggrolls coupon for my Yelp check-in to start. Very prompt service. My boyfriend and I both ordered Pho, as he was not feeling well. I got the rare steak pho. It was absolutely amazing. The flavor was incredible.   I have ZERO complaints about this place. I will definitely be back, sooner rather than later. So glad I finally found a place I can get pho that's not all the way in China town."}
{"text":"Food was really good, large portions. Would have liked to see more veggies- bok choy, etc"}
{"text":"This place has good cheap food.  No complaints...the service was a LITTLE slow considering there we're a ton of people in there, but they did go BUY jallapeno's when I asked for more which was WAY above and beyond. We got the veggie spring rolls, thia tea and pho...it was all really good.  I got a yep appetizer for free and a buy 2 get one free thia tea, which was exciting!  Bottom Line: This is definitely a good Vietnamese place...I'll be going again."}
