{"text":"This is my favorite place to come to when I am home sick. I love their flautas they are the best. Anytime I miss El Paso, TX I just come here to bring back the memories. Another great quality about this place is their staff, I've been here numerous of times and they are always so nice and joyful, and never have an attitude. They make it feel the way it is back home."}
{"text":"I felt as though I was sitting in Juarez/ El Paso. The tacos are delicious - elote (corn with cheese) was fabulous. Taquitos (flautas) - WOW!!! Food was fresh, warm, tasty, perfectly seasoned! I can't say enough wonderful things about this place. 

Now - let me warn you - it has absolutely NO atmosphere. It looks like a renovated McDonalds. You go up to the counter and order and sit down at a McD's type table. \"Silverware\" is plastic. Food comes on a plastic tray on a paper plate or paper french fry type holder. 

You don't come here for the atmosphere - you come here for the food!!!! Yes, the location is quite seedy - but it's just one block north of the 95 off Eastern. Excellent prices!!! If you are from west Texas/southern NM it will take you back in a heartbeat! 

To everyone else, you MUST GO HERE to try authentic TEX -MEX FOOD!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and staff. Always friendly! The elotes are amazing! They are spicy just how I like um. My kids love the churros"}
{"text":"Love everything about this restaurant must try the torta de colita de pavo so delicious"}
{"text":"Best fast food in town!! If you're looking for a fancy place , this one won't do ; but the quality of the food is great !!, they have home made tortillas (priceless) and those \"colitas de pavos \" ( turkey tails) MMMMMM!!! Delicious!! 
Staff here are very friendly ! Recommended !!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from New Mexico, and I'm used to authentic mexican/ tex-mex food. But when I moved here to vegas, I was unable to find anything that sold authentic mexican food than this place! Since I found them on a little drive, I've been coming here almost every Sunday or whenever I have a day off. Their El Paso flautas, which you can choose any kind of meat that they offer on their menu, I get shredded beef, and they soak in red chili sauce with cheese on top. It's by far the best food I've had!! 
Plus for those who like and know what menudo is, this is THE place for it!! 
Always clean, always friendly and super fast.
Everything is made right there In front of you, all to order. Like I said, if you want REAL tex-mex this is the place to be at!!"}
{"text":"Well for starters food wasn't terrible but wasn't all the hype that I've been told either i grew up in el paso loving the actual Chicos tacos and a few family members have and actually some still work there. Next the hrs this place has is ridiculous first the place right on the building says closes at 9pm and thats not the case and second who in there right mind closes up shop on a Wednesday please....as to the staff i have been there a few times and in the visits that i have been i have seen almost all the times are very dirty and how they handle the food prep area makes me think twice and also sometimes as well give kind of a attitude when taking your order. I met the owners before when they just opened up on Durango can't say anything bad about them seem like nice people but unfortunately we always as shop owners have to be at the mercy of good help ..I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND. Just really wish they would change there schedule and get better help food can also use a bit more flavor maybe some salt (just saying)."}
{"text":"Very very friendly service!  I am not from El Paso but I can appreciate the El Paso/Juarez food.  Have tried about everything on the menu and have not been disappointed.  I personally have enjoyed the tortas most.  With your choice of meat, every meal is an adventure!  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have ate here several times. The food is always delicious, hot and fresh. The service has always been very good and friendly. In my opinion they are better than Chicos Tacos in El Paso, Tx."}
{"text":"The double order of El Paso taquitos will be the highlight of your day. Crisp yet saturated in sauce, messy  by the end of the meal but on point in flavor.

The barbacoa, on either a burrito or a taco, will make you miss home. Throw on some cilantro and onions from the salsa bar before you take it to go and try not to cry as you eat: not only is it perfectly soft, it's also full of flavor, unlike other places.

Surprise menu hit: the turkey neck! Ordered it as a torta but my order was received wrong as a \"side\" in a taco, but the cut of meat is still perfectly flavorful and fatty and fried fresh.  Probably best as a torta, will have to order it again.

 For the reviewer who said it's inauthentic to use yellow cheese: we're talking about  hood border food, not the meal you got while at a resort in Cancun, don't let the door hit you on the way out!"}
{"text":"The bessssssst!!!!!! The desebrada is DELICIOUS!! So juicy and flavorful and there's papas in it too  and their tortillas are different but oh my god they're so good!!!!!!! The flautas both Juarez and El Paso are amazing. Not plain and flavorless like some places. Everything I've had here is above average in my opinion and they have a big menu with a lot of options."}
{"text":"Used to live in El Paso when I was a kid. Had the famous Chico's Tacos order and it tasted just like when I was a kid. Thanks for the throwback memory."}
{"text":"This place is a homerun!! My lady is from El Paso and the time I spent there (5yrs) was awesome! The people are friendly,  the city is safe, and the food is ridiculous! Chicos Tacos comes to mind when El Paso and food are mentioned. It is said to be one of if not the stop to make when in EP. I am one of this who loves Chicos Tacos so when I was told about this place it was a must try. I went and ordered two singles,  some fries, and an elote en vaso. Let's start off with the elotes, it was a little disappointing to be honest it was nothing like the elotes I've had in EP, it has mayonnaise which is totally different from what I've had and its not that appetizing, its also made with yellow corn. EP elotes has white corn, butter, Chile, and  cheese so I had high expectations and was let down in the elotes department. Although if you want some street corn this is more along that flavor profile and in that sence it is good, just not elotes good. Now on to the tacos, they were........GREAT! I mean you can tell that its not chicos but it is darn close, the spicy tomatoe sauce with the rolled tacos and some green chile sauce is amazing and will hold you over till you get back to EP for some chicos! They are piping hot and will crunch as you eat them and then have a great bite when soaked in the sauce! The fries are great and with ketchup and dipping them into the spicy tomatoe sauce really brings back memories of eating at Chicos. This place is called juarez-el paso border food, so in my opinion if your not from that area or have been there you will not understand the food as it can't be compared to anything else really. If your in the mood for some Mexican food and want something different I say definitely give this place a go next time!"}
{"text":"Nothing compares to chicos in El Paso. But I'll take it. Disappointed that they discontinued chile rellenos. Those were my favorite. For that only 3 stars"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and folks behind the counter are very nice. It's a hole in the wall but I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My mom asked me to choose a new place for brunch, and I chose Border Food. I was completely disappointed with the food. Notice I didn't say the employees or the customer service. I had better expectations for border food thus I go to El Paso every year. And as far as I'm concerned the food doesn't get any better. I ordered my favorite barbacoa tacos and carne asada fries, they were not fresh. The barbacoa meat was smelly and dripping in grease. That is not healthy, and the carne asada fries were horrific. The avocado wasn't real, that hurt my feelings even more. And the carne inside the fries was old, the coloration and taste are what lead me to that. I do not look forward to returning, due to the food. 
The employees are great, and the place is so Art Deco.
hopefully in the future the food will become much great."}
{"text":"I came here from a friend's recommendation to try their Colitas de Pavo. Now I'm reaching out to all of you saying \"Try it!\" You will not be disappointed. 

Besides that, the restaurant is pretty clean. The only problem I had was the wait. I was standing at the cash register for quite some time before someone came to help me. 

Can't wait to come back for some more!"}
{"text":"Well at least the food was really good. It was a Bean & Cheese conundrum! The service here is soooo terrible I can't imagine going back. Went in on Thursday 1/19,at 4pm and I encounter \"Terror\" this young Hispanic lady with the look of death. 
She asks what we want so we all order then my daughter asked for a torta with only beans and cheese.  Terror informs my daughter that they don't have bean and cheese tortas on the menu. I tell her that I know but can I just ordered a carne asada torta but with only beans and cheese.  
We spent about 5mins going back and forth about the torta. She advices us against ordering a bean and cheese torta because she will still have to charge us like $7.00 for it.  I said that's fine but it will make my daughter happy.  She finally said OK and I told her specifically no lettuce or any other items just beans, cheese and bread. Order comes with beans, cheese, bread,  and lettuce and butter.  
Honestly if not for her terrible service and that bad torta this place would be rated 5 stars as a fast food joint. 
My advice: stick that lady in the back somewhere far away from communication with paying customers."}
{"text":"The people are very friendly! The food was great. Not your traditional Mexican food you get here in Vegas. The barbacoa was really good it wasn't sweet like some other places. I would definitely come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment. Many people have talked it up for sure. I always passed through it and it looked like a pretty good place. I went in with my family and the person taking the order was so rude seriously the worst customer service. I ordered a torta de carne Asada and my sister orders the flautas. Now the flautas were pretty good no complaint there. The torta was one of the worst, it had more lettuce than anything. The meat looked like it had been sitting there for some time. Big disappointment. The rest of my family was not please as well. I sadly will not be returning to eat here. I wanted to like it but the energy of the entire place was just so down. Maybe it's the day and time we went but I expected more."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican fast food restaurant. Great service, great prices, and great food. Feels like I'm back in El Paso."}
{"text":"This place use to formerly be a KFC. I walked in and it looked very clean, because my husband had been here before I went on his recommendation of the picadillo burrito which was a ground beef bean and potato burrito and it was good and I had a sangria soda. I kept it simple with my choice since i have had some bad experiences with mexican food. Everyone here was nice especially the guy at the register who was helpful with the descriptions of the menu items. I will be back and I recommend it if you like mexican food."}
{"text":"I had to post a review because this place was wonderful!  When I ordered the Barbacoa tacos the lady who waited on us mentioned another type of taco they had (I don't remember the name of it but it sounded like they don't always have it-it) so we ordered that too.  Both tacos were perfect but the one that was suggested ended up being our favorite.  The El Paso taquitos are amazing! It's best to order tacos or something else to eat while the taquitos cool down and the cheese melts.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you're searching for authentic Mexican food then this is the place to go. Everything on their menu is delicious. They have the best elote en vaso outside the park. It's really close to my house and the costumer service is amazing they're all very nice people"}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. The employees are always friendly and genuinely kind in their customer service. 

The Nachos con Desembrada aka Shredded Beef Nachos make my mouth water just typing about them. 
The Fish Tacos are crispy and filling. The sauce on them is creamy yet refreshing. 
The Juarez Flautas are just how my mom makes them. 
The cuisine from the Northern part of Mexico is rarely represented, this place nails it!"}
{"text":"Always delicious and inexpensive. Whenever we're in this part of town we stop by. Very charming restaurant and usually quick. I've never really had to wait long for my food."}
{"text":"Great food all around I stop and eat here every chance I get.... From the tacos de chicharron to the burrito de Chile Colorado ... Taste like real Mexican home food... Oh yea menudo is great...."}
{"text":"Ehh, ok I have been searching for Colorado green Chile here for 10 years, there's just nothing like it here in LV. 

First impression walking it, it's dirty. Feels like there's just grease on everything, food was ehh, I couldn't eat much because of the dirtiness in side. 

I gave 3 stars because people really seem to like this place, there was a few families in there when we went and they seemed to be happy with what they ordered. So maybe I ordered the wrong thing. (Ordered the rolled tacos smothered in what tasted like water and black pepper) If I would have ordered take out I might have enjoyed it. Probably not. 

Again 3 stars because the guy that took our order was very nice, explained the menu. Family owned so 3 for that has well. 

If anyone knows where I can get green Chile like Colorado. Santiago's preferably, please private message me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I loved the family owned and operated establishment vibe! We bought a ton of things and paid under $25. The elotes en Vado, flautas de Juarez, carne adada fries, and fish tacos were bomb! The crinkle cut fries were fresh and very crispy. It's been forever since I've had a bottled Coke! This place was suggested to us from one of our friends. A great local spot and I loved the customer service. I think our order was taken by the owner. He was very friendly, explained everything on the menu thoroughly , and confirmed our order twice! I will definitely come back again in the future!"}
{"text":"OMG! I am definitely coming back to this place! I just moved here from El Paso a month ago and I have been going through withdrawals! 

Upon walking in, it's clean, a good size restaurant and the pictures on the wall all remind me of El Paso! Even on the ceilings are shirts from the high schools and UTEP there as well! 

If you've ever been to El Paso, traveled through there and had chico's tacos, you'll have to try this place!!! The tacos are a bit larger here and the tortilla wrapping the tacos taste a bit different but it is pretty comparable! The sauce is pretty good too and the cheese on top actually melts! They have a bit more of a selection here than chicos like menudo, elote en vaso, raspados, and ice cream bars too. I will be coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"If I could make a suggestion they need to go to the original cheese, and possibly double fried the tacos so they didn't get soggy.  The meat inside the El Paso flautas are better, the sauce is a thousand times better!
Those French Fries ... OMG are the bomb!!!  Don't know what you guys do to them but don't change a thing!!!
I do know you guys need to add burgers to the menu, if those guys in EL PASO are complaining about it F'em!  You're guys menu is way better than theirs, and they should have gotten a trade mark on it!!!
If you guys make these little changes theirs nothing stopping you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Best menudo in Vegas (except for home-made, of course)!  Friendly & dependable service too. Just wish they opened a little earlier cuz sometimes it's hard to wait until 10 for breakfast!
4-5-14 update:  Yay! Now they open at 9!"}
{"text":"Pretty freakin close to Chico's. It was delicious and I was sad that when I went in that it was empty! People don't know what they are missing! Just great and it filled my craving!"}
{"text":"If you ever had Chico's Tacos in El Paso, Texas, this is the best thing to hit Las Vegas. I love it!"}
{"text":"I was told about this place by my mother who is an El Paso native and actually makes her own Chico's Tacos whenever she wants. Being that I'm on vacation and was craving them she was reminded about this spot. Came with high expectations.... I was let down. I ordered a single, a quesadilla with chorizo, and a cup of corn. 

The tacos were reheated flautas, making the tortilla stale. The sauce a little too salty, but the salsa was on point. 

The quesadilla, well... When I ordered it the girl said she had to ask the cook because they've never made one before. She consulted the girl in the back for a few minutes then asked if I just wanted chorizo and cheese. Not exactly sure why it was such a complicated request. 

The corn in the cup was the absolute worst of this entire order. Now, usually corn in the cup is made with fresh corn on the cob, cut down and scooped into the cup. For some reason they decided to use plain canned corn. With only 3 other customers in here I'm sure they could have spent a little time on using fresh corn. Guess not. 

Probably wouldn't come back here. I'd rather just spend an evening making them myself at home. And not have to suffer the family with 4 kids running around our of control."}
{"text":"Read about this place in the paper, so we drove over from Centennial Hills to check it out. Sorry to say it was not worth the trip. Mediocre Mexican food. Frozen Taquitos, watered down horchata from a mix, yellow cheese? A note to 'Anglos', if you see yellow cheese in a Mexican restaurant, expect cafeteria style Mexican food. No yellow cheese in Mexico. One unique item though, turkey rump. I had it in a sope. Tasty, but nothing special. $18's? My bad."}
{"text":"Chile Colorado burrito is the best in vegas! Plus, those rolled tacos ahogadas are fire too!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a taste of home! Some pretty close version of Chico's Tacos and some Juarez Feria Flautas! Menudo is great too!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and fantastic staff.  We've been regulars since they were on Durango.  Can't say I've tried everything on the menu but the flautas El Paso are a staple for me."}
{"text":"This spot is the best and a reasonable price for what they have to offer. Colita de Pavo and 2 corn in a cup is my usual here and I always crave for it. Keep making it the way it is. It's really good!"}
{"text":"It's not Chico's Tacos but it's pretty damn close! I like this place a little better because they have tables and chairs instead of only booths. They also have functional AC in here. 
We drove 25min across town to check it out and I'm glad we did. The presentation is on point. Looks just like Chico's. Their sauce is a little more watery and their cheese melts unlike Chico's. Pour some green salsa on
top and enjoy these beef flautas. You can order a single or double of them. You might need a fork by the time you get to the bottom but those ones are the best. They've been marinating in the red sauce. When you're done dunk your fries in there too. 
I also ordered the flautas Juarez while we were here. I chose the chicken ones. They were crunchy and cooked to perfection. Lettuce, cheese and a green sauce were on top of them. 
The elote comes in a cup off of the cob with all of the toppings. Way easier to eat it like that. 
While enjoying your food check out the ceiling. There is T-Shirts from the original Chico's Tacos. Saw an El Paso Chihuahuas one up there too (minor league baseball team). There's also a lot of historic pictures of El Paso and Juarez all around the restaurant. 
The staff was very friendly and spoke both Spanish & English fluently."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, I got the chicharon torta. The torta had good flavor & a nice kick but they really skimped on the chicharon. I had more bread than anything else. I probably will return to try their taquitos though, cause those suckers looked delish! I keep you guys posted!"}
{"text":"I had a fish taco which was absolutely amazingggggg, I've recently fell in love with fish tacos and these are he best yet!! Also had rolled tacos although they taste decent the chicken wasn't very flavorful so I took away a star. But those fish tacos!!!!!!!!!! I'm coming back for!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I have never had anything like the flautas El Paso before, but they are great! And all at a reasonable price. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Really good place.  I get the turkey tail tacos.  They are amazing.  Im not a fan of menudo but my buddy is.  He swears this is the best place in town to get it.  Said its cleaned really well and cooked only on the weekends.  You have to get there early because it goes fast.  

Defiantly would recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is from El Paso and he says it's pretty close to the real thing. If you're from El Paso and craving Chicos, this is the place."}
{"text":"AWESOME SERVICE !!!  Jennifer was attentive to us.  We had many questions and she was super nice about everything.  She told us the best stuff on the menu and it rly was the best.  Go check this place out."}
{"text":"Loved the food here. I had the Asada Fries and never got to finish them because of how much they give you. The flavors of the asada and ingredients were fresh. Definitely a good place to try and do not forget the chicos tacos. Freshly made like the ones in El Paso."}
{"text":"5 Stars Service,  very friendly staff & willing to turn back on the grill for an El Paso native. 
5 Stars for the food.  Yes it does taste like I remember. 

I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Great little gem, I wanted to get away from the strip and can across this place.  The staff were professional and very nice,  it was very clean,  and the food was awesome."}
{"text":"Limited menu, as far as meat selection.  I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 2 chili Colorado tacos. So beef or beef.  Lol. The carne asada was meaty with very little fat and inedible content... good quality meat. The cilantro and onion was generous and fresh.  Good amount of meat on both tacos.  The Colorado was a little bland to my taste. 

Perhaps Roberto's salsa bar had spoiled me but I was disappointed at the selection on the salsa bar and the to-go portion cups are tiny. There's chili Verde salsa (delicious, zingy, flavorful) and sliced, pickled jalepeno. That's it. 

The service was great and the facility was clean.  Sketchy part of town (as many great taco spots will be),  good freeway access at eastern and the 95."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary since we got married here in Vegas 9 yrs ago.  On our way home, one of his friends suggested eating here since he's from El Paso and he misses Chico's tacos. He ordered the El Paso flautas and it's similar to Chico's tacos but of course it's not the same.  Not too bad though tasty and fresh and it did scratch the itch considering El Paso is 800 miles away.
I had the nachos and it was just ok.  The place was clean and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here to try out her hometown food. It was early in the morning and it sure was delicious. Their Mexican food is a little different from other Mexican food like their sauces are light and liquidy, but delicious!! I had their rolled taquitos with melted cheese and their light sauce..the bomb! I could have had like 3 of them, really! The place is quaint and full of El Paso familiar pictures from around town in El Paso. Very clean and a very warm and curteous service. Great experience all around! A must try..."}
{"text":"Authentic... yeah but not that great. Nachos were ok and that's why I gave it 2 stars. Do not order the burrito because you will be disappointed. Overall will not be back and I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice, maybe a year apart.  I really want this place to work out!  If the people working at this place read this I have one advice, your tomato sauce for the El paso flautas needs oregano! You are getting close, but no cigar."}
{"text":"Maybe it is because I came in the middle of the afternoon. Maybe it is because the ambience lacked the typical festive energy of a Mexican restaurant but I didn't really enjoy this place. I walked in without anyone in line, and received no greeting whatsoever... A little bit of a downer. In fact, and despite my inability to make a choice at first, the cashier and those behind the counter never bothered to make a suggestion of a dish for me to try. 

 I decided to play it safe and ordered a steak burrito. Evidently their version of said typical dish only includes beans and a choice of meat. I was really disappointed to learn they do not have any rice or much of anything else to add to their dishes. The steak was somewhat crunchy (a bit old), the beans lacked taste and the meal was, overall, not remarkable at all. 

I must sadly say this is is not the place to visit for good food."}
{"text":"¡Delicioso!

I have already been here a few times and coming from my hometown of El Paso, I can certainly say that this place is WAY BETTER than the original Chicos Tacos, the original restaurant this was based off of. Everything I have tried is delicious: the Flautas El Paso and Juarez (that should be a given), the Nachos, Burritos, (have gotten both with chile colorado, and it is one of the best I've had), the Menudo (only served on weekends, so that's a bummer), and of course, my favorite, Elote en Vaso! I get it every time. Paired with una coca, (a mexican coca-cola), and a meal from here is sure to please your palette."}
{"text":"I was curious to see what this place was about.  I am not accustomed to Juarez style Mexican, let alone Mexican cuisine in general.  The restaurant is fairly new and decided to give it a shot.  

The outside and inside is conservatively decorated and efficient with its space.  There are some really cool pics inside, I am guessing is from the region.  It may be silly to say, but was intrigued to see if this place served dishes with cool cartel names as a theme.  But once I entered, realized that I was an idiot that needs his head checked.  It still would be cool to get a Jose Malverde combo or something.  I know it can be a sensitive subject and better quit before I get myself in trouble.

I ordered the Juarez Style Flautas and found it nerve wrecking since I was not familiar with the menu, but reluctant to ask questions since I don't speak the native tongue.  So I just pointed at the nearest picture of a combo meal and said, \"one of those pro favor (minus the por favor part).\"  It wasn't half bad, but don't know what was special about it let alone the difference Juarez Style and any other style for that matter.  I washed it down with a horchata and spent a decent amount around $5.

This place is near the job and in a pretty location if you ask me if you are commuting on Eastern or exiting off US-95.  Although, I don't think that this place is getting much buzz and they may need to consult their marketing manager about that.  I haven't seen any reviews come in and I am probably the less experienced Hispanic food critic since I am not even sure on what to order unless I got help.

With that said, I have to rate this place a 3.  I usually rate the Roberto's next to my house a strong 3, well it is the cleanest Roberto's I have ever been in and that is saying something.  Which only means it would only be fair to give this place 2 by that standard.  Let's just say its a 2.5 that was rounded up."}
{"text":"This was off our normal Beatin' path; we stopped in for street tacos and flautas. I'm so glad we did, it was delicious. 
The cashier was super friendly, nice and even helped explain some of the items and pronounced them correctly for us. 
The verde sauce was the best!! 
Very clean!"}
{"text":"This place gets it! 

The name says it all. What a great way to market themselves I could not think of a better way myself. 
Let's face it if your here it's because at some point you have had a great experience with food  in either Juarez and or El Paso, and you want to recreate that experience.

This place delivers is value taste and customer service. The food is legit, they are fast and friendly the restaurant is clean and inviting. 

You do feel as if for a second you leave Vegas and are eating at your favorite joint in either of these two cities with great culinary staples known to each. 

Great job to whoever brought this much needed concept. The only thing I'm sad about is not coming sooner."}
{"text":"This food sucks. Horchata sucks taste like water with a lil of cinnamon. Eww the burritos are very thin and have no rice,  no flavor at all. the sopes looked ok, but the first bite says run away!!! It had some thing crunchy in it, i look and beans very hard. Has no flavor. Raspado de Tamarindo eww nasty. The only good thing was the salt with lemon. My experience. 9/2/14 Never coming here again. Disgusting"}
