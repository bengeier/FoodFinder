{"text":"Such lovely and attentive service from our waiter, Eric! Really awesone and helpful throughout our meal. Food was adequate, but we didn't try anything that really stood out."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been opened since forever. It's always our go to spot when we have cravings for chinese.   Located in the area of cote-des-neiges, this restaurant is a true gem. Food is always fresh and service is OK. My family has been going here for over 15 years now.   Good for big groups & family gatherings. The only thing I'd change is the porc chop..it's good but I want REAL salt & pepper porc chop..they one that taste like curry!   They also offer free delivery! Cheers to Kenny & Eric."}
{"text":"Honest review: 3.5 stars so I am rounding up because rounding down is lame.   I ordered some delivery the other night from Kum Mon: a combo for 2 to share with my sister - hour and sour soup, spring roll, general tao chicken, szechuan shrimp, mixed vegetables, and yang chow fried rice. I wasn't blown away by anything but it was all tasty, was priced fairly, and the portions were pretty big (we had leftovers). Clearly, these choices weren't very authentic, but since I hadn't ordered from there in several (10?) years I was a little apprehensive about what I might get. As the kids say, \"I wasn't mad it\", so I'll give some items from the à la carte section a shot next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located west of downtown, just south of Mont Royal. Everything we had was well prepared from very fresh ingredients, and served in generous portions.  Didn't taste any MSG in any of the dishes. Service was prompt and unobtrusive...the classic style of service you get from older male Chinese waiters.  A nice dining experience, and a pleasant surprise, given that I had driven by the restaurant several times without ever stopping in."}
{"text":"Overcharged for our food, and not given a receipt by the delivery man. The bottom of the delivery bag was also covered in about two mm of liquid grease. It's a shame because the overcharging turned what would have been a reasonably priced meal into the exact same price point as everywhere else. Every container was absolutely covered in grease and it was just difficult to enjoy. The chow mein was also weirdly gelatinous in certain bites.  Was told delivery would take an hour, and it did."}
{"text":"Delivery is often slow for what I recognize must be pre-made Chinese food, but everything is undeniably tasty. Portions are also very generous. Expect a 1 person combo to feed 1 1/2 - 2 people."}
{"text":"Good food and low prices for portion sizes. Make sure to be very hungry, portions are huge (a dish can easily feed 2-3 people)."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, the price is great and the waiters always try to make you smile   It is definitely not the fanciest restaurant in Montreal but if you are hungry their lunch special included a soup of your choice and a healthy portion of the dish you chose. You definitely can have leftovers for dinner!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from them almost 8 times now from just eat and every time the delivery is super quick and food is piping hot and fresh and really generous portions. I love their hot sour soup as well as crab meat corn soup. Their bean curd soup is also good. Their young chow fried rice (house fried rice) is the best on the menu as it is BBQ pork and shrimps. The beef fried rice is also good. Their general Tao chicken is delicious and also my bf loves their pepper and salt chicken. They also have combos at such great deals, most expensive one is Like $17 per person and if u want u can add another person for $11 only. Their spring rolls are my favourite on the menu. Last night we ordered 10 of them; they are $1.50 each but they are huge! The egg roll is the same filling as the spring roll but different wrap and is $1. I thought their shrimp dumplings with peanut sauce was okay, my bf thought the peanut sauce was too much. Maybe if u order it, tell them to put the peanut sauce on the side:) also tried their crispy noodles and all of them Are good . Highly recommend this place and will be returning / ordering. I never been to the restaurant but if delivery is this amazing I could only imagine how much greater it'll be dining in and eating the food fresh!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for many years because of its good service and for its authentic food. Recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Multiple take-outs since my previous review. My usual order includes Cantonese style chow mein, sweat & sour pork and a few more. Very tasty every time - though recipes slightly vary each time (extra or less ingredients). Still very low prices for portion sizes - a single dish easily feeds 2-3 people. My go-to place for Canadian Chinese food."}
{"text":"Seems like everytime that I visit family in Montreal, we go to this Chinese restaurant.  This is our relatives favorite spot, and they always get plenty of food!  Got to admit that I do not know the names of most of the dishes.  I never get to order anything cause the family orders everything.  I just pig out!   Also, I can say that everything has been tasting really good!  Service has been great as well!  I always look forward to family taking us here!  Clean restaurant, delicious food, and good service adds up to 4 stars!  Yes, I am a fan."}
