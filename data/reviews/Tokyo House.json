{"text":"The Tonkatsu  I have been searching for. So good It seriously brought a tear to my eye.  Such friendly service as well."}
{"text":"I stopped in tonight after reading all the great reviews. The elderly and energetic Asian man was taking orders. As mentioned by all the reviews, he was very friendly and helpful. I showed up around 7 p.m. and he was manning the front desk solo like a boss.

I ordered the Beef Yakisoba to-go and the Shrimp Fried Rice. Both of the dishes tasted great and were priced reasonably. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"i moved to the tempe area about 2 weeks ago from socal, the mecca for asian restaurants.  since moving out here, my only taste for asian food has been panda express.  well, i was craving teriyaki last night but had no idea where to go so i did a search here.  tokyo house got a bunch of great reviews and everyone mentioned a cool old man behind the counter so i just had to check this place out.

as soon as i walked in the door, i was greeted by the old man...from across the joint, behind the counter, mind you.  he was SUPER nice and SUPER funny!  

checked out the menu and the selection was a bit overwhelming!  they have every teriyaki dish available, and bunch of fried rice and noodle choices, and for those that like rabbit food, vegetable dishes.  i was a bit surprised though to not see gyoza or pot stickers on the menu...was bummed out about that.

i had a hard time deciding what to get but remembered Sarah W.'s review of the house chicken, so i went with that.  i went with a large order and let me tell you; if you're hungry, you definitely will be stuffed after a large order.  the dish was very tasty and delicious and was definitely overflowing with mushroom.  i love mushroom!  the house chicken is supposed to be spicy and although it had a little kick, it wasn't the \"spicy\" i was used to from asian joints in socal.  i wish it had a bit more rice, though.  either way, the dish was great!  i would definitely order it again!

i highly recommend this joint.  you will be treated well by the cool old man behind the counter, the place is clean, the servings are generous and the  price is cheap!"}
{"text":"Woah, teriyaki sauce sweet and starchy much?  Notably,  the beef is not steak,  which wad my fault for assuming it would be. Also, note that the free egg roll with check in only given if order a large entree, even though this fine print is not specified on the coupon. I will not be back"}
{"text":"I have been going to Tokyo House for almost 4 years and it is most definitely the best all around food in Chandler. The owners are fabulous people and the food is delicious and very affordable. I usually get the House Chicken but everything is fantastic. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The BEST in AZ...

Just go there. I grew up in Seattle with really good teriyaki on every block.  Moving here was a shock.  This is as good as almost any teriyaki i've had in Seattle.

The owner is funny as hell too.."}
{"text":"Defiantly the best Chinese food in Chandler,AZ. A lot of things on their menu are great, and the chili oil is soo good! Very friendly staff as well, Won't get Chinese food anywhere else."}
{"text":"Been going here for quite a while. Very good teriyaki chicken dishes with excellent sauce  - really hits the spot! Good portions even though it's a little pricey. They've also added sushi to the menu & most of it is great. There was maybe just one sushi roll (I think it was the spicy tuna) that was just \"ok\" but still better than most places. The tempura shrimp and Las Vegas rolls were very good.  They also have a variety of other options like fried rice, brown rice, crab puffs, miso soup, vegetarian dishes, etc. I see a lot of people complain that the restaurant has changed over the years & it's true..it has changed but the food has remained consistently good. I still highly recommend - it's not easy finding a truly great teriyaki place in AZ that's delicious & good portions for the price - usually you sacrifice one for the other."}
{"text":"I love love love this place for all the reasons that you can love a little restaurant.
The shop is small but cozy and they made sure that there is still plenty of space to sit and enjoy if you choose, but you can also order to go and either way the food gets to you quickly. It is also very fairly priced.
The food is good. The teriyaki chicken or beef are at the top of the list to try. The orange chicken, lemon chicken, beef and broccoli, mongolian beef, sweet and sour pork and all styles of fried rice are really good as well.
The other reason that I love to come here is because of the sweet gentleman that is ALWAYS behind that counter. He is just a character. He always seems so happy to see anyone and everyone, and he will most definitely put a smile on your face. It's nearly impossible to order from him and not.
All around I love to come here and I suggest that everyone give it a try."}
{"text":"This is not the Tokyo House I used to know.  I have dine in here before and remember how good freshly cooked the shrimp fried rice alone when served.  This time the same dish ordered just this weekend and although the taste seem the same I felt the rice was cooked some time ago as well as the shrimp and looks like they were just mixed together then microwaved when ordered.  The quality doesn't seem fresh when served but, still good taste.  I'm thinking maybe it's a bit late in the day when I came to eat.  Nevertheless, food should be freshly cook when serve."}
{"text":"Love their house chicken and Teriyaki chicken :) The old man who owns this place is awesome!!! He always welcomes you in with a smile."}
{"text":"I love this place and the new owner is very friendly and nice!!! :)
U won't regret it! The price is good !!! Im going here all the time!!"}
{"text":"Why did it take me so long to find you? Been in the neighborhood for 6+ Years and I just recently found this place! 

I have tried most things on the menu and love the Chicken or Been Teriyaki & the House Chicken/Beef. Go with a Large only a buck or so more and you get a huge meal that can last you 2-meals. 

Food is always really good, Lots of it, great flavor and the guy who runs the place is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Awesome fried rice and a huge selection of authentic asian food.  The owner is always working, and i value that in a little family business like this.  I recommend supporting it over corporate joints."}
{"text":"I came in last minute on a Friday night, literally 5 minutes before closing and they had no problem taking my order which is always a good sign of customer service. I ordered a teriyaki chicken with extra sauce and a large chicken yakisoba for my husband. Both were delicious! Be aware, the yakisoba comes with rice underneath, we will ask for all noodles next time. The meat was very tender. You also have to option of brown rice which I thought was nice. I would recommend this little place to anyone who's in the mood for something quick and delicious."}
{"text":"Best Spicy Teriyaki EVER!!! If you love teriyaki chicken then you need to try Tokyo House. I was introduced to this place a couple years ago and have been in love ever since! Quality is always the same, always amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food and you can't beat the price! 

Glad I found this place on yelp! I have been about a mile from Tokyo house for over 6 years and just recently started coming year. What a fantastic place and as the others have said, the guy who owns the place is really nice.

The food was awesome! So far I have had their Teriyaki Chicken, Teriyaki Beef, Orange Chicken and House Beef..My favorite is the House beef, with an amazing sauce on the tender pieces of beef and mushrooms. The rice they use is just great too and they coat the rice with the sauce so you are not eating bland rice throughout your meal.

I generally get a large meal for around $6.50, which usually lasts 2-meals and I can eat too. The meals are big! And the quality/price can't be beat....I am definitely going to be coming here regularly."}
{"text":"I'm so full of their good food right now that I can hardly sit and type this review. 
My husband went to what I refer to as \"nerd games\" i.e. Dominion etc. so I decided not to cook and take my 15 and 2 year old out to grab some take out. 
My daughter is an Asian food addict and I feel bad that I don't buy it that often so instead of the usual crap, I remembered that Tokyo House was right on the corner. 

I'm SO glad we went. 
 
We ordered the Orange Chicken, Orange Beef, House Fried Rice and Egg Rolls. The food was DELICIOUS!! The portions were huge. We will have left overs to feed all four of us tomorrow. You can taste the real orange flavor in the beef and chicken. The house fried rice is the BEST rice ever. I actually don't like rice but I would eat this every day. It has huge shrimp, beef and chicken pieces. Perfectly cooked and not too sticky or dry.  The food was piping hot even when we got home.

The owner is the sweetest, funniest and coolest old Asian man you will ever meet (besides my Sister's husband) :-) 

It was beyond refreshing to have a cheerful and polite person greet you and chat with you in a restaurant. Much better than the sullen, rude teenagers who are just glad to get you away from the counter or who are so fake and valley girl sounding you want to push them off a bridge.

I have lived within walking distance from Tokyo House for over 7 years and I'm SAD to say this is the first time I have gone. I KICK myself for being so close to this GEM and not eating there. I will be going back and bring friends and family too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is a great little lunch spot. I love going here when I'm in a hurry  and want a good quick lunch. Their chicken terriyaki is outstanding! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is why i use yelp, amazing fresh food and great atmosphere. It's not a date place it's the cheers of takeaways."}
{"text":"This place will easily become a favorite for us! We came here because if yelp and we are most definitely coming back! The man behind the counter made us feel very welcome and showed us the picture book with all of their food in it. We went with the orange chicken (delicious and so much better and different than Panda Express if that is what you're expecting), teriyaki chicken(also delicious) along with the beef with bell peppers(my favorite) with fried rice! The both the white and fried rice were great and I loved the egg rolls. You can't beat the price. We stayed and ate in the restaurant because the little old man wanted to know how we liked the food. The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because I reserve it for over the top amazing food. This was still amazing. Eat local!"}
{"text":"Food taste terrible. Got the teriyaki chicken and never tasted teriyaki like that before in my life! The terminal I had a weird strong maple syrup flavor. I don't know what their using but it's terrible. The rice is ok. The chicken was sliced way too thin. Waste of money."}
{"text":"After living within walking distance of this neighborhood gem for 8 years I finally tried it one night after a long day at work (and coming across great reviews).
The place is clean and very basic.  The real delight is the little old man who seems to be at the counter every day. He is so upbeat and friendly, and sharp as a tack. This place has a very loyal following and I'd attribute that to him as much as the well priced and yummy food!  You can't beat the price and the portions are generous. 
With all the places that are going under these days I am confident this neighborhood staple will be going strong for a good long time!"}
{"text":"Yakisoba is fantastic!  Tonkatsu too!  Best Japanese food in the East Valley.  Never disappointed when I eat here.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ive always ordered from here . 
Favorite place for my rice and chicken!
Not to mention great sushi!!
Fast service and good pricing !"}
{"text":"So delicious, always consistent. Try the Orange chicken and white meat teriyaki!"}
{"text":"The best spicy teriyaki chicken I have ever eaten!  The place looks deceiving, but produces excellent food and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Good for a quick, cheap meal. I had the orange chicken and enjoyed it. My boyfriend had teriyaki chicken, which he did NOT enjoy, and he found the miso soup watery and too salty. This is not healthy Japanese food, that's for sure. If this place was right down the street, I would probably return when I need cheap food quickly, but since it's a fifteen-minute drive for me, I will most likely not be back."}
{"text":"So bad!!. Wouldn't take my dog there. Had chicken and vegetables in brown sauce in a bowl. All the cabbage was grey on the all edges and almost all large rib pieces. carrots all tasted old. Gristley chicken if that's what it really was. That was my dish.

Hubby's dish was beef Yakisoba... even worse. Same brown sauce, not yakisoba sauce (not even close. Gummy big noodles... yuk and double yuck. 

Sons bento lunch. Barely any meat, didn't really have any taste. Highly disappointed in eggroll.

No one ate much. Left hungry. Yes it was that bad."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 5 years!  I've tried Beef teriyaki, shrimp/veggie tempura, orange chicken, and beef broccoli..all are goood!!!!! For 4 yrs I was only ordering the beef teriyaki bowl. I've only tried the other stuff this year and I'm planning to try the other stuff on the menu. My bf always gets the obento which he loves. I'm not a big fan of katsu that's why I dnt usually get that. 
The man that owns it (I think his name is Mr. Wong) is super duper nice! I love coming here after a long and frustrating dat at work bc he's soo cheerful, positive and peaceful person that makes my frustration go away."}
{"text":"Mr. Foo was the rare gem of this place and although I don't know what happened, as an owner I would of reevaluated his worth. As for the food changing I honestly think that's just a placebo. The food has always been delicious pretty much no matter what you get. The new owners are nice but they will never make you feel as warm and appreciated at that impossibly always happy old man did."}
{"text":"I am very happy that I found this place. I have been searching for a great rice bowl restaurant for a long time and I finally found the place! However it's not just a rice bowl restaurant... they also have a whole menu of Chinese/Japanese dishes.

We went for lunch and ordered the chicken teriyaki rice bowl combo, which comes with an egg roll or salad and a soda! We were stuffed and it was only $14!
 
Even though other yelpers were recommending other dishes, I decided to play it safe with the chicken teriyaki bowl. The chicken teriyaki was fresh and piping hot! And they put just the right amount of teriyaki sauce on the bowl.

My fellow yelpers got this one right! Excellent food, excellent prices! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Right when my boyfriend and I walked in we were greeted by two of the sweetest women I have ever met. They were so personal and offered so many great suggestions after we told them what we liked. The food came in large portions and was super fairly priced. Especially the sushi. If you're in the area and want something quick, easy, and delicious this is YOUR place to go. Food was amazing but paired with the wonderful customer service made it a place we won't quick forget. The cashier even gave us a stamp card with our two meals already punched in. Don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, it has a very Japanese feel to it. The menu is mostly Japanese items with a dash of Chinese as well. The Sukiyaki Beef is probably my favorite dish as the sauce on it is just to my liking. Lemon chicken is another great entree. Teriyaki is...teriyaki. Friendly employees working at the counter is a plus. Definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"After reading all the awesome reviews on this place, I had to give it a try. So great! The food is fast, fresh, fairly inexpensive, and very filling. Their house chicken is FANTASTIC. The old guy behind the register is kind and has a great sense of humor. I'll definitely be going here again. :)"}
{"text":"Just talking to the owner is worth the trip, he's amazing!  And his food is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Mouthgasm (noun) - an orgasm that takes place within the mouth, often caused by tastebuds being overwhelmed by deliciousness.

... yeah I'll just leave it at that.  Don't forget you can get all white meat chicken if you're into that.  IMO it's worth it for all chicken entrees.

Also, the main guy who runs the place is always in an amazing mood and has yet to turn my frown upside-down when I come in bi-weekly to get my grub fix.  If there is a god, he'd eat at Tokyo House, plain and simple.

Finger-lickin' good.  Don't forget to get some \"Dew from the Mountain\" hahahaha"}
{"text":"I just ordered the Las Vegas roll and it's probably the most disgusting item I've ever ordered at a restaurant. The first bite somehow tasted like freezer burn and the rest of the roll reminded me of the bits of breading you find at the bottom of a frozen Tyson chicken nugget bag. The sauce did nothing for this roll. Please do not order this. 

On the other hand, the teriyaki chicken is a step above Panda Express."}
{"text":"Really, really, really good fried rice.  The other menu items are also good, but I mainly like this place for the phenomenal fried rice.  :-)"}
{"text":"Orange chicken and teriyaki was great! Boyfriend and I ordered with DoorDash. I also got an avacoda roll. Slightly disappointed with the amount of avacodo in it. Mostly rice.

Miso soup was also good. Would go back just no sushi. :)"}
{"text":"What a great spot. Delivery through Door Dash, FAST!! Food was hot, fresh, delicious. I'm really glad i chose to order from them tonight, it is a decision that you should make for yourself soon."}
{"text":"I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for Tokyo House. I've been frequenting this establishment since I was weaned off my mother's nipple. All the time, people ask me: \"How'd you grow to be so tall and handsome?\" I don't tell them that it was genetics. I tell them that it was all the good eatin' at Tokyo House.

My mom told me that when I was born my head was four times larger than my body, and because of my explosive bouts of infantile diarrhea, I wasn't able to gain weight. In layman terms, my head-to-body ratio was way out of whack, and it started creating all sorts of health problems. The doctor said that my huge head was consuming so many calories that it destroyed my immune system and put the rest of my body in a state of malnutrition. He told my poor mother that I only had two weeks before my head consumed my little limbs. Thirteen days after the doctor's diagnosis, I looked like a pink balloon on a limp string (the string being my last identifiable extremity, if you know what I mean.) My string started receding into my head like a toddler sucking up a wet spaghetti noodle. My mother thought that it was the end for me. She didn't know a better way to send me out of this cruel world than to serve me a proper last supper. She drove us to Tokyo House, ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, whispered her goodbyes to me, and stuffed my head with that magical food. 

I owe my life to Tokyo House. It's because of them (and the awesome Asian man at the front register) that I'm alive today."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, much like other sushi I've had at other restaurants. The orange chicken was a little dry and not the best cut, but sauce was fair. We ordered off of Amazon Restaurants and the food arrived within 30 minutes and came with the sweetest note from the owner! Overall, pretty good food with great service."}
{"text":"On 2 occasions my teriyaki chicken bowl had a small chicken bone in them. Rather than die a painful death I decided to stop eating there. Don't really recommend."}
{"text":"Disgusting food, and gets orders wrong. Not worth your money even though they are cheap. The food is poorly made and the flavors are horrible... ordered via door dash and everything I ordered that cost extra was left out or incorrect"}
{"text":"The flavors were good, and the rice was perfect, but unfortunately my teriyaki beef was ridiculously tough/chewy.  I'm not sure if it's the cut of the beef, or if they forgot to tenderize it, or if it was cooked improperly, but while it tasted great, it was inedible as it was basically beef chewing gum!

Guess I'll have to stick with chicken from now on."}
{"text":"Love it! The older gent that runs the counter talks like some kind of cartoon character.  He is so sweet and welcoming.  Great food too! I will continue to make this a go to place for Japanese food.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"People are right. Not very authentic by a long shot but it's really tasty and you can share a teriyaki bowl with another person."}
{"text":"The first impression I got was a very welcoming one! The sweet man at the front greeted us and was SO sweet and nice! I liked how clean the restaurant is too. I ordered the Mongolian beef and my boyfriend had the orange beef, they were both delicious! I went because this place was highly rated on here and I'm glad we did. We will be returning very soon to try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years. Best teriyaki chicken and orange chicken bowls I've ever had. I miss Foo. He always made lunch runs fun. Always great service though and not too long of a wait."}
{"text":"I love eating here when I'm craving Japanese cuisine. The orange chicken is delicious and piping hot every time. I get it on a bed of yakisoba instead of rice. Customer service is always nice. Food comes out fast. However, prices have gone up quite some... and I miss the old man, Mr. Foo, that used to work there. He always remembered my mom's name and would always be ecstatic to see us come in! It's a tiny restaurant so a small group of friends is nice to enjoy eating with."}
{"text":"Love this place. It was one of those restaurants that I passed for years and never went inside, and when I did I regretted all those years of having not. The prices are fair for what you get and the women working the front are polite. There are lots of options for meals and I usually go with popular choices like teriyaki beef/chicken or orange beef/chicken. I would say to try those if it is your first time. It's also next to a smoke shop I like."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 1996 and even though I moved away to the west side of Phoenix several years ago I still make an effort to drop by whenever I am anywhere near.  Today work brought me to within a 15 minute drive so I stopped and got my favorite large orange chicken to go.  I called ahead and it was ready when I arrived 6 minutes later.   The chicken is always crunchy and the orange sauce is the best I have ever had.  This place has never let me down and only cost me $7.02 including tax.  This place is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. We discovered it by accident, and now he always wants to go here. We've only known about it for a month, but we go here so often they personally know who we are. We always get their sushi because it tastes amazing for an even more amazing price. Their sushi selection is a little limited, but what they do have is outstanding. If you're in Chandler looking for a good sushi place, this is it! (We always go meaning to try different things but somehow always end up with sushi)"}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry and craving some Chinese food this would be the place to go. Seems to be a small family-owned fast food style of restaurant.  Ordered the sweet & sour chicken which didn't disappoint.  Obviously it's no PF Chnags or pei-wei, but it's edible at a decent price. Could have went with 2 stars but I don't want to discourage people from trying it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. Disgusting! We got take out. Sushi fell apart, there was sugar in the white rice. Yakisoba tasted old. Called to complain and kept getting the ' hold please, so sorry routine. Never going back."}
{"text":"I've come here for lunch a couple of times with coworkers. Not much to say about the food except that it's cheap so you get some value - bang for your buck. I don't think I've had anything here that was really memorable enough that I would want to come back here to experience again. This last time I had oyakodon and it was just ok - too many onions for my taste and a little bland. Even though I was eating inside they served it in styrofoam. Would probably only come again if outvoted by the rest of coworkers when choosing a place for lunch. Lots of parking - in a mall with Taqueria Mi Casita and Video Paradise."}
{"text":"I am going to be the party-pooper here and say that my visit was only so-so. My brother and I both ordered here and neither of us finished our meals. Maybe... we just weren't that hungry.

With that said, maybe I just don't know good (real) Asian food when I have it in my mouth? This could be the case... or my brother and I both got bad batches. After all, we did stumble in about 15 minutes before they were closing (which generally doesn't make the cooks happy).

The owner however was super nice. Actually, absurdly nice. He had a demeanor that had us both walking out going... \"could that guy be any more calm?\" Seriously though, I've never met someone so peaceful. 

Seeing as how we had never been there the owner also whipped out a little picture book with all the stuff they serve. It was nice for us two un-cultered folks.

With all this said, would I go again? Not really unless I was right there and someone else wanted to go."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's near my job and they are very nice, quick and the food is really good."}
{"text":"I wasn't that impressed. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? I had a basic chicken teriyaki. They definitely give you a lot of food. The sauce was very sweet. I was ok with that but what I didn't like was how fatty the chicken was. I had to throw 25% of it away. Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"After trying this place a couple of times, I have to say I'm not going back. I wanted to like it but the yakisoba noodles on a bed of rice doesn't make sense to me. My daughter didnt' find the orange chicken that great either. Too bad, really like the quaint garden area."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. The food is below mediocre now! The new owners changed way too much. The crab puffs are gross, the teriyaki sauce is bland. Overall quality is at a - 10. Don't bother going anymore."}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place. The food is really good for cheap Japanese food. Much better than the other place across the street. The gentleman that is always at the counter is very very nice. If I want cheap Japanese, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I had the large beef teriyaki.  It was really good, with lots of rice and beef all covered with enough teriyaki sauce to have extra for the rice.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Maple Syrup Chicken Teriyaki??

The WORST teriyaki I've had in my life. The sauce taste like I'm eating pancakes. It has a horrible smell to it and the taste is disgusting. I'm a huge teriyaki fan and gave this place a chance. Ordered a large chicken teriyaki and a roll for my wife. She threw out the Philly roll after one roll! I ate double the amount as my wife, two bites, and threw it out. WASTE OF MONEY.

If I wanted maple syrup, I would go to IHOP. Is this IHOP? NO! 

What was the funniest moment of the lunch, I gave some to my dog, who eats everything in sight, and he smelled it and walked away. First time ever that has happened. If a dog doesn't want the food, I would highly recommend staying away from this place.

AVOID AVOID AVOID"}
{"text":"Inedible sushi, and I'm not picky! Dragon roll was only imitation crab with what I'm guessing was eel skin on top?? Ordered from online menu, which say 2 egg rolls per order, I received one. When I called she just told me, \"no, only one.\" Skip this place."}
{"text":"Place is great grilled Japanese food. Remember that this place specializes in grilled meat and veggies. Soups are great to. 

The \" old man \" is Chinese and runs a great Japanese restaurant, the fried stuff isn't the best , but the teriyaki and anything on a skewer is amazing. Try the beef kabob with veggies and you won't try and other Asian place again. Taint be scared by the names of the items on the menu he has a book of pictures for everything on it, which he uses regularly to help people who don't know what Oniunowi is.  Located in the \"Asian block\" of chandler they have access to the best Asian produce and products in the valley. The old man works the front counter everyday, no exceptions, he seems to remember all his regulars and treats everyone else with respect. He does move a little slow and you may see your food wait under the window as he processes the other orders but if you just watch him it is worth an extra minute or two. The white rice is sushi grade long and sticky.

Place is actually ran by the woman in the back but her English is not there, she helps him when he messes up, another sign of a perfect combo of passionate people. 

If you don't enjoy your time there you may need to reevaluate your current life."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this joint very much. The owner was a happy fella who loved making people laugh. But it seems they've changed ownership. Their chicken teriyaki wasn't amazing like I remembered, and their sushi.... no. Hell no, in fact. Sticky and flavorless. I was very disappointed as this was our Japanese food headquarters many years ago. Not anymore. Will not be going back. Cheap ingredients and zero passion."}
{"text":"Sad news! I stopped by today due to my craving for shrimp fried rice ( yummy) I've been coming here for quite some time.... the reviews speak for themselves, food is amazing!  I always get shrimp friend rice spicy. But everything is good. Unfortunately a new face took our order today, and there's been sushi added to the menu. Hmmm ... so I asked for my favorite cashier (the older gentleman everyone talks about) and I was informed he quit. I was sad and shocked! The lady behind the counter went on to say he was too old and thats probably why he quit. I was confused, and felt she was wrong. Anyone who comes here knows he has a young spirit.  Kind of bummed. So once I received my order I started to notice changes in the portions and little things here am there. My boyfriend insisted I was wrong, probably just let the news bother me a little too much. He could be right. Food was ok, today at least! Ill give it another try next week :)"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. When many places just feed you the standard versions of what you can get anywhere, this place impressed! Had the Las Vegas roll and it was waaay awesome. Crispy outside and perfectly made inside. Sauces were great. Also shared a combo meal with orange chicken and teriyaki chicken. Very very good. If you are reading this you have to try it. Great staff. Very helpful and obviously passionate about Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Best Spicy Teriyaki chicken ever!! The little old man is always so nice and accommodating!!! I highly recommend Tokyo House!"}
{"text":"From reading other reviews, they changed ownership and their high rating are not from the current owners but from those old reviews (that old menu which is not what they serve at the restaurant does look good - it is on the web page still).


I can't recommend this restaurant at all.  I lived in the Bay Area and was used to good Japanese food.  I have also lived in other states and had ok teriyaki (not the best but worth eating and/or coming back for).

This was the worst I have had.  

The meat portions are very small, with a lot of rice.  The beef was very tough, and extremely thin slices (see picture).  The chicken was mostly ok with some tough pieces and again a lot of rice with some chicken.  The teriyaki sauce for both had a strong maple syrup taste mixed with a little soy sauce - something I never expect in a Japanese restaurant.  It would have been a lot better with standard bottles teriyaki sauce that can be found in almost any grocery store in America.

The vegetable bowl was better, it had a decent tasting sauce and soft tofu but was still mostly rice.  

It was about $8 for large servings and I would have expected a lot more meat for that price.

Note:  the menu on their web page is not the food you can get at the restaurant, most of those choices are not available."}
{"text":"I love this place. The man behind the counter is so awesome. He greets you like he's known you your whole life.  The food is great too :)"}
{"text":"Had the chicken and broccoli, pretty sure the chicken was cooked yesterday. Super chewy, hard and dry. No flavor. Couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"The owner is a very likable guy and I like how he says ' Welcome to Tok-ee-yaoo hooow-se.  You want Dew of the Mooow-tain ?\" whenever I walk in.

The food isn't the best Chinese I've had, but for a 5$ teriyaki bowl, it's pretty tasty and about the best deal there is. The meats have a nice smokey taste to them and the rice is always perfect.

I've  been here 10 times and have had a good experience 9 out of those times.  I would give this place 5 stars, but I had undercooked chicken one of those times."}
{"text":"Update: Not liking this new owner, food does not taste the same. :(

 I have been going to tokyo house ever since i was a kid with my parents for almost 20 years. This is the best place for Teryaki anywhere and I have tried it at alot of different places. I have even had genuine teryaki from real japanese family recipe which tokyo house comes very close to.. Now I take my family and son there which he loves it too... I know that we will keep going to this place forever... One more thing, the old man at the counter knows how to treat his customers.. The only thing is I think is funny is that anytime i ask for hot mustard, they only give me one packet and depending on they extra flavor i am wanting to add to it, the chili oil is also sooo good to add to each dish."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place ! Food is amazing and fresh specially the sushi my fiance and I love this place."}
{"text":"Tokyo house just became my favorite place for teriyaki chicken. This place has a more mapley that usual teriyaki sauce which really works with my love for sweet and savory foods. Staff was extremely friendly and nice. Not sure if it's family owned but it sure felt like it was! This place definitely beats out Kyoto Bowl, Yogis, and Teriyaki Chicken. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent, food in the other hand is not as good. It was better when old man was running it, the lady in the front told me old man sold it but they kept the same recipes. I disagree with her, their teriyaki is not as saucey anymore always need to ask for 3 extra teriyaki sauce, katsu bowl breaded falls apart and it's always soggy, yakisoba is super sweet now, it has a maple taste on it. I grew up eating at this place old man use to call me and my siblings little man and whatsoever cool dude. Now food is really horrible. I rather chose yogis over this place. Always a disappointment"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have tried their food.  The first time I thought it was ok so I thought I would try them again.  The resturant looked clean and was busy.  I saw someone else's food and it really looked good.  I wish I ordered that instead.  I ordered a chicken teriyaki to go.  A pretty easy dish that is normally is hard to mess up.  When I got to work and sampled my first bite I realized they messed it up.  The chicken was burnt and dry.  This was the worst I have ever eaten. They put so much sauce on it to me it seemed like they were trying to hide the fact it was dry.   I ate the rice around the chicken and tossed it. I guess I can cross this place off my list now.  Note to the cook:  if you burn the food I don't mind waiting for you to redo it.  The reason I won't eat here again is because the cook allowed burnt food to leave his kitchen.  If he let that happen who knows what other errors in his cooking he finds acceptable and will serve to his customers.  I could forgive a bad sauce but I can't forgive serving damaged food."}
{"text":"Food was boring. It had zero flavor. A little more sauce or seasoning would have gone a long ways. I can't comment on service because I just picked up. I honestly will not be back."}
{"text":"literally...so many times i have thought 'should i drive all the way to chandler to eat this?'

i found this place while playing third wheel to my best friend, meg, and her boyfriend, adam. we wanted chinese food so i got to searching for something cheap near their house.

adam chimes in mocking yelp 'how many spoons does it have, sam?! if it only has a 3 spoon rating we're not going!'

we arrived to see this tiny, upbeat asian man rocking the house. he seriously holds the fort down and he is funny. and adorable. 

we took our food to-go and started tasting all of the treats we brought home. holy smokes this food was the business. 

we got the noodles with the chicken as well as the chicken with the mushrooms. the old guy recommended both. i was expecting mediocre food considering the price and the hole in the wall-ness of it. but this is sooooooo goooooooddddd.  i'm pretty sure it's horrible for you so thankfully it's pretty far from me. but anytime i'm over there, we eat here. 

make fun of yelp again, adam! you're going to start worshiping the yelp gods (and ME!) for finding you this delicacy."}
{"text":"I read all the yelp reviews. I told myself \"No, Emily. You are going to try this place, you are going to eat the teryaki beef and you are NOT going to comment on the old man. This is about food damnit! YOU CAN DO THIS\".

*Sigh*.
I love this old man. All my grandparents are dead and I want to secretly adopt him and treat him as my grandad, or just sit at a booth with my elbows out and my hands holding my head, just watchin' him work. Maybe he'd want an adopted grand daughter to tell life stories and provide asian food to? No? Maybe? Just a little bit?

Well fine, I'm an independent woman and I will get over it. Maybe. My regular-sized beef teryaki was only $6 and it was a pretty big meal to eat for lunch. I really liked the sauce and the white rice, although I added some red chilli flakes in oil to give the meal a bigger kick. I thought the pricing was great, the food came out fast and you got exactly what you came for. 

Now lets go back to talking about the old man..."}
{"text":"I almost feel bad for writing this because the little old man is super nice.  I ordered tonkatsu and shumai; to put it simply, the food sucked."}
{"text":"It was fantastic and the place was clean it was great food. I order the teriyaki chicken with egg roll yum yum"}
{"text":"Ordered via UberEats due to a promotion and actually threw it all away.

Deep Fried Rolls were over fried and tasted burnt.

Kobe Roll had chewy beef.

Neither the Kobe roll nor a Dragon roll were properly rolled or cut.  They fell apart at first touch.

Best part was the free egg roll and its all that was eaten."}
{"text":"We just ordered form here and were totally disappointed when our food arrived.  I could not believe that the teryaki chicken came with no rice, for $6.95!  The wontons were burned and tasted horrible and the sushi was very weak compared to other places in the area, I literally get better sushi from Fry's.  We will not be ordering from here again.  Worst part was it was delivery, so we didn't make alternate dinner arrangements."}
{"text":"The food here is great, affordable and the employees and owner are very friendly. I always go with the Terriyaki chicken or orange chicken. 

Either way you will like their food, fried rice is a plus as well"}
{"text":"I expected great things after reading the reviews for Tokyo House. My boyfriend and I were looking to try somewhere new, but coming here was a huge disappointment. The food was absolutely terrible. We ordered the orange chicken, curry chicken, beef fried rice, and miso soup. We couldn't finish any of it! It is very obvious that Tokyo House uses cheap ingredients that are not fresh. They use shortcuts in their cooking, especially when it comes to curry, omitting coconut milk all together.

The white rice was dry and flaky, the curry was an odd color and was very watered down. The beef fried rice was not fresh and was grey in color. The miso soup was so foul that I threw the entire container away after one sip. 

Do yourself a MASSIVE favor and do not waste your money here. Go a quarter of a mile down the road to Chon Thai instead. Their food is very fresh, colorful, and full of flavor. You'll never see a dull dish at Chon Thai. 

Avoid the disappointment and save your money. Go somewhere else other than Tokyo House."}
{"text":"I discovered this place about 3 years ago and I've been coming back ever since. I love the little old man who is usually there to take your order, he is so happy and positive, and because of that I always leave a tip. I eat in and take out often. My favorite is the teriyaki chicken and house rice!! The house rice is the best I've ever had, I don't know what they do, but it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"I don't like to write bad reviews but this place managed to get from really good to just average to now being pretty bad.   I am giving them one star as the curry chicken is still passable, its a lot more bland and watery now. else It will be 0 star.

My friend ordered and picked up our orders.  She had the terriyaki chicken and she said its watery now and it seems the taste is off.  I tasted a few pieces and the sauce is indeed very different.  Its watery and sweet and seems like something you buy in a bottle at lee lee.  FAIL, they used to claim they make the best teriyaki chicken back when the old man was here, but now I guess U can make the best teriyaki chicken at home, since it's a generic tasting sauce :)

I ran into the old man that used to work here last week and his wife at lee lee's, they confirmed that they no longer work there and, whoever is writing about them being there is probably posting it in the hopes that, those who really loved his service would go back and give it a shot in the hopes of running into him.  Don't waste your time if u are hoping to do that as I think the old man and his wife frequent the fry's across the street or lee lee's more often.  If I see him again I will tell him everyone misses him and if possible get a number from him.  He is doing very well and enjoying his time off after being let go off by the new owners.   He is not interested in finding a new job for the moment as he is headed to Malaysia for a holiday in February. He is healthy and happy and glad we all remember him.  I did not have a chance to chat long with him as another former customer saw them and came over to give him a hug and chat with them.

anyway, back to this place, I guess its time for me to move on to trying the food at red dragon or simply going north to aloha kitchen.  too bad this place used to be cheap and good but now I guess its just cheap."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Never going back to this place after 15 years of being a customer. The worst food poisoning ever. 

My review will be in 2 parts, the first for the actual food. The second for the day after. 

For the record, I've been eating at Tokyo house roughly 15 years. I work close by, and I've always lived in driving distance. I've LOVED this place since a kid. It use to be run by a little old man and his wife, but is now run by new owners... This is when everything has changed.

I went here last week and ordered Beef Yakisoba, a normal go to for me. I normally ask for it spicy but went regular this time around. Normally I'm asked if I'd like rice or not (which I normally decline as the dish is suppose to be all noodles) I received my food, where immediately I knew something was different. Since there was new owners, I figured there was a new cook and maybe things have just changed. I gave it a shot..... and I've never regretted a decision so much in my life. 

The normal dark consistency of the noodles wasn't there, it was a lite sauce lacking any real vegetables or meat for that matter. In total I counted 7 small pieces of beef. They added rice without asking (eh whatever) but on top of that the portions have changed fairly drastically from what it use to be. I get cutting back on portion sizes, but meat and vegetables to? What am I really paying for here? 8$ for just a bowl of noodles? The taste itself was a little sour, almost not pleasant but I kept going to see if it would grow on me. Inside of the dish were water chestnuts, which were never in before and I enjoy them so no complaints. However biting into them was sour, almost like they were opened and sitting out over night. I stopped with the food about half way through and tossed it in the trash. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disclaimer: TMI

The following day 6am strikes me with urgency. My bodys way of letting me know to get up now before you crap the bed. The hail storm of watery half solid chunks of feces spewed from my body with such force the water splashed around in the bowl. I knew today would be a bad day, I call out of a work and attempt to go back to sleep. 

Within 30 minutes I'm up again, my body calling me back to the sacred holy ground which is my toilet. The only way to describe what was happening in there was this... Imagine your a kid again in the pool and you fill up one of those water launchers and then you try to push it out with all your force. At this point I get in the shower and after I try to go back to sleep again.

30 Minutes goes by again, at this point I'm up. As I'm sitting on the toilet for round 3, the urge to puke begins. As I'm bent over the tub praying to Jesus I puke already a sensation rushes down to my sphincter. I jump into the shower and prepare for the worst. Thats when it all happens. Those convulsions you get from puking when you tense up so much you can't control the rest of your body. I release from both ends with such force. I turn on the water and it hits my back like cold little knives cutting my skin. I start to see the remains of one end of my body flow down the drain. I immediately begin to puke again. 

The rest of the day was constantly running back and forth from the bathroom, dry heves, and a fever. I could of went more into detail but I figured I'd spare you all the hardship.

I will never be going back to this restaurant. 15 years and you trying to cut corners on your food has lost you a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Weird teriyaki  sauce, mushy lemon cbicken. Sauce should be on the side for delivery, no chop sticks, no soy sauce. I wont order again. Im not it was chicken, flattened and weird texture. 2 stars for the urber delivery lady."}
{"text":"Found this place from yelp and had to check it out based on the great reviews. All I can say is wow! This place is super yummy! I have a new favorite! Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed. My only downfall was they don't accept Amex cards."}
{"text":"THE BEST Orange Beef on the planet.  Guaranteed."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The food is excellent and they appreciate your business. It's a little slow to get your order in do call first. You won't be disappointed. Get the orange chicken"}
{"text":"Love the little old man and the orange chicken!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. I feel like I may have been poisoned and honestly cannot qualify it as food. Do not eat this. 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Quick, tasty, and inexpensive rice bowls. It's a good quick fix for when I'm having my Yoshinoya withdrawals. They don't have the same type of beef bowls, but their house beef is good also. It comes with a lot of mushrooms, more mushrooms than meat, but I like it that way.

The little Chinese man here is super friendly. I usually order take out and he always offers me a cup for water while I am waiting."}
{"text":"Best Teriyaki Chicken in town.  Period.  I have been to many Japanese restaurants and nobody comes close!"}
{"text":"The orange beef alone is good enough to earn this place 5 stars. I thought the teriyaki chicken was a little bland, but as an out of towner, i can already say my first stop off the plane next year will be for some more orange beef. Thank goodness for yelp, because the place itself is very plain, and never would've pegged it as a place that would've knocked my socks off with the first bite."}
{"text":"Everything seemed okay at first, and I thought the prices were awesome.. but in the end I paid money on the last day of my vacation for food poisoning. I've been puking all night"}
{"text":"BEST teriyaki chicken! Could eat it every day!!  Been a loyal customer for 25 years and counting!! Going to pick some up right now!"}
{"text":"This place is no longer what it use to bebeen going here for years. They do have a good salad , the dressing is unique and lite. 
There teriyaki chicken is to sweet and the chicken just doesn't taste freshly prepared."}
{"text":"Best take-out Japanese!  Have been dining here for about 18 years, and my husband for over 20!

Consistent, excellent quality and friendly service.  We have been huge fans of the teriyaki chicken all of these years, and are trying to work our way through the menu...but you know how it is when you find a good thing!  Never have found any other teriyaki chicken anywhere as good as this.

The owner definitely provides all of the charm of this little place.  Lately, his place has been so busy, there is no chat time.  If it's a slow day when you go, he has great stories to share, just get him talking!  He's a wonderful person.

Good eggrolls, yakisoba, fried rice.  There are so many other menu items, stop in and give it a try! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I just want to hug that sweet little old man who runs the front.  SO NICE.

The orange chicken is delicious.  We're also a big fan of the teriyaki... portion sizes are pretty big but leftovers never stick around in the fridge for long.  The sauce is great though.

The decor is plain but I think they're trying to update it a bit... the location is a little sketchy.  But the food definitely makes up for it.

Definitely a Chandler must."}
{"text":"Flat pepsi. Cold food. They mic it so now my tongue is burned. I like fresh food when I eat out. Sure its good but why not just have a microwave diner. Its cheaper"}
{"text":"I went back a few weeks ago and got my go-to dish, orange beef. 

just gonna cut right to the chase: it has definitely changed. the orange beef looked extremely brown and it was missing it's subtle orange saucey delicious glow. the beef tasted over cooked and the portions were a lot smaller than usual. 

maybe it was an off day, who knows, I'll definitely go back, but it'll be a shame if it's like my most recent visit. 
:("}
{"text":"This place is not the same. The recipes either must have not been written down by the old man or they just don't bother to follow them anymore. 

Was a 5 star place years ago with the old man in the front."}
{"text":"I think 2 star is being a bit generous. I was hoping to get some good sushi but it was okay.. My vegetable bowl had old lettuce and cabbage. This restaurant is definitely not a place to go for sushi."}
{"text":"OK, yeah, everyone LOVES teriyaki, we know!

Well, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!

I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture! 

There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.

Their house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.

And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little \"heavy\" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.

As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.  But, for the great unique quality and cheap price, I guarantee you're not going to find any better in AZ!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our meal at the Tokyo House. Had the orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, and the beef yakisoba. Mr. Fu was welcoming, kind and extremely helpful. Definitely worth our drive from San Tan Valley, and much better than our original plan of PF Changs."}
{"text":"The vegetable fried rice is killer. Fresh streamed vegetables!! Great quality produce."}
{"text":"I do not believe how this place got the rating that it has. I got burnt, over cook shumai, precooked and dried out chicken.  Food is bad to go along with the unhelpful order taker.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Always great and fresh Asian food. The orange chicken is my favorite! We come here all the time because of the convenient location. They have a loyalty card which is nice too. They're a little pricier then other similar places, but it's worth it. 
Update: Cashier always seems a little flustered, no matter how slow or busy it is. Food could be made be made more consistently in regard to taste."}
{"text":"Asked for spicy Teryaki chicken and receive a pile of burnt red peppers on top. Whole dish tasted like burnt food. Bummer. Owners seemed nice."}
{"text":"Love this place:) Just like all the other Yelpers I have to say the little old man at the counter is the best!!
My daughter is a fan of their teriyaki chicken & I love the Sukiyaki Beef. This place is a tiny hole in the wall without much in decor but the service is super friendly & the food is quick and delish. What more do you really need?"}
{"text":"The food is definitely fresh here made to order excellent sushi great dishes all around. I'm pretty sure the sushi is the hidden gem here."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not crazy good, not cheap, but the prices are alright. The regular is the size of a bowl, the large is huge for only a buck or two more. I am trying to lo lose weight so the regular is fine. Next time I will order the broccoli and beef. Staff is mostly friendly, yet always seem rushed. The Orange chicken was good, very sugary and only came with rice. The food is always made fresh and the restaurant seems clean and normal. The inside is nothing special, just a casual fast food feel, I wouldn't come here for a nice ambiance or anything, only for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"As a the food is also so good, one of my favorite quick bites. The $5-6 bowls have a lot of food and are very filling. I love the tofu. I am able to customize my orders very easily. The phone is always answered quickly. Also it usually only takes 5 minutes for my order to be ready."}
{"text":"Really good food for the price you pay. I love their Yakisoba !!!!! Also I just love the little old man who works the front. He is always so happy and really does his best to make his customers happy.. 
That's why I feel guilty giving this place only four stars.. But I'm giving them 4 stars because  I wish there was another person to help with taking orders and taking phone orders.. Usually it's pretty busy and the poor man is juggling everything in front so it could take awhile to order and get your food.
Tip- call in your order and just pick up! So much faster :)"}
{"text":"Will NEVER order sushi from here again. Absolutely awful. Ordered a salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, and California roll. Pretty hard to mess up, right? WRONG. Bad presentation, fish was NOT fresh, everything was WAYY too spicy seemed like they pour hot sauce on it instead of spicy mayo. I love sushi and paid a decent amount for it, but I couldn't even eat this."}
{"text":"Like others have said here, it's fantasic. I must concur, the man at the counter is hilarious, attentive and truely cares about his customers. When I went you could just tell the true passion he puts into making sure his customers come back again and again. THIS I RESPECT! 

I tried the Teriyaki Chicken, every bite the flavors just melted in my mouth. The sauce is excellent and the chicken is cooked just right. Better than ANY teriyaki chicken I have ever previously tried. 

Now that I have come here, it is going to become one of my regular hotspots. I'm excited to keep trying the different menu options and  savor the equisite flavors in every mouthwatering bite. 

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal! The food is inexpensive, the service is friendly and the food is authentic and extra tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Ms Florensia Amy and Maya are the best workers in Tokyo house and food was good and healthy  by the way thank you so much"}
{"text":"So I have only ordered from this place through UberEats..however the food is so good I now order wayyyy too many times a week. I get the teriyaki chicken over brown rice every single time, and upon trying it I feel like this is what America must have felt when Coca Cola had cocaine in it, the sauce is seriously TOO good. It's unreal. Highly recommend the food here."}
{"text":"Not the same since new ownership."}
{"text":"I've been in this place before over the years and always had a good experience.  The man who runs it is so very nice and welcoming and cheerful (and sometimes flattering!).  Tonight I was just looking for a place that was open after 9pm, when most non-chain places seem to close.  I skirted in here just beforehis  9:30pm closing and ordered a \"House Fried Rice\" with shrimp, beef and chicken, small size.  It was still warm when I got back to my daughter's apartment and I dove right it.  It was the best fried rice I'd had in a long time, not gummy like some, not too salty like some, just right, and only $6.  It was more than enough and I couldn't finish it so I'll have leftovers for tomorrow.  I'm sure glad I made it there in time.  I recommend this small Mom and Pop place.  It's been here for years."}
{"text":"The worst Vegas and Philadelphia  rolls that I have ever tested. I could not stand to complete and left from the restaurant. I do not came back again, though kind and quick staff."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last night for take out. We ordered the lemon chicken and the orange chicken with egg rolls and crab puffs and a bowl of noodles that are like lo mein.  The lemon chicken is two deep fried breaded chicken breasts with a thick lemon sauce poured over it, like an orange chicken sauce, but lemon. It was over a bed of white rice. It's pretty sweet tasting, no spice to it. The orange chicken was really good too. The egg rolls were really greasy. But I liked it that way. They were still fresh tasting even though it was pick up. The young lady working the front counter is very nice and gave us a punch card. For every $7 you spend, you get a punch. After 15 punches, you get a free $7 meal. I spend $40. We will order from here again most definitely."}
{"text":"I was kind of war driving with Yelp and found this little place. It had the best rating in the plaza it was in. I was almost gonna get taco bell and call it a night, but I was compelled to try this place.  The gentleman who was working the counter, I think from the other reviews I saw was the owner. He was a nice man and a little humorous. The people there seemed to know him and knew this place well, I ordered the house chicken combo and a miso soup, I got it to go since I was camping out at home that night. I gotta say, I'm not a big rice bowl fan, but this place was great. The soup was good, and chicken was really good. chunky, lots of mushrooms and flavor, and just enough spice. I devoured it all. I usually don't eat all the rice, but it mixed well with the chicken. Even the egg roll was really good and crunchy despite me stopping at the store on the way home. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Super owner who loves his customers, I saw this bitch in there giving him a hard time while I was there and I wanted to rip into her. Now where else would you see customers so protective of a local restaurant owner if it weren't so good?

Best orange chicken ever, the sauce actually tingles your tongue and it doesn't taste generic. His wife actually uses real oranges and it is so refreshing. The miso soup is so good and filling as are their rice bowls. They use very beautiful pearl rice in their rice bowls not just regular long-grain rice here. The Japanese very much value the quality of the rice and it shows here.

The owner asked me specifically if the food was good because as he put it to my partner, \"I always ask the woman if the food is good because they would know better about good quality food.\""}
{"text":"I loved the chicken terriyaki on rice. The Miso soup is delicous! This what Bennihana should be seerving for their soup!"}
{"text":"Once again i have found an all time favorite dish at this fine establishment.

The House Chicken! If you do not like mushrooms what so ever or do not care for spicy food i do not think this will appeal to you. Oh my god it is out of this world! I do not think i could consume it every day back to back but every other day or once a week would be my preference.  Its even amazing when its warm not burning hot temp. wise.  I will edit this review and add in more as i try more on the menu to keep you all posted. So for anyone who wants a little spice and kick in your mouth with yummy mushroom this is for you! 
:D"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight and I definitely plan on coming back. The inside was both clean and modern. The ladies at the counter were very nice and helpful with deciding what to get. They even have a little book of pictures so you can see what the dishes look like. when I decided on the beef sukiyaki they politely warned me that it was a traditional Japanese dish that many people try and don't like. I decided to get it anyway. it was burning hot, fresh and tasted absolutely terrific. On top of that, it came out to a little more than $9 for a large drink and a large entree (which is basically two meals). I couldn't complain about any part of my visit, and I would love to meet the old man that some of the reviews mentioned."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Best 'Rice Bowl' place around. Nothing has ever been bad and the guy who takes your order is awesome. Very accommodating and helpful if you ask for suggestions. I recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Just tried this place twice this week, after reading the previous reviews. Checked out the menu online and ordered a variety of platters to-go for my family.

When I went there, I noticed that the menu online is priced very differently than the one inside the joint. About a dollar difference, but still.....I went there expecting my total to be a bit different than what it was. Hopefully that will be fixed soon.

Ordered the Chicken Yakisoba for myself the first night along with some crab puffs and veggie eggrolls.  Wasn't impressed with the Yakisoba.  Thought it was a bit dry and lacked flavor.  The crab puffs and egg rolls werent anything to anything to brag about. Pretty standard.

Tried my husband's chicken teriyaki plate and thought it tasted really good.  What really DID impress me about this place was the portion size.  You REALLY do get quite a bit of food.

I enjoyed the chicken teriyaki so much that I ended up getting it again the following day. 

The little old Japanese guy in the front is hilarious, and worth the trip just to see him. IMO.

I will be returning to try their other plates."}
{"text":"The lady at the cashier was very warm and welcome with us! The beef sukyaki I ordered was filling and had the right flavor! My sister ordered the tempura and tells me they could have added a little more."}
{"text":"Amazing service, quaint casual atmosphere. They even gave me an egg roll for free. The teriyaki sauce is light yet flavorful without overpowering the meat. The rice is expertly cooked, this is probably the best authentic food I've had in the area."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years.  The teriyaki chicken is my favorite.  The sauce is amazing, the chicken is lean and not at all fatty, and the rice is sticky just like it should be.  The owner is  so sweet and helpful.  I've lived in the Valley for over 40 years and I can say that I have yet to find a place that has such delicious food for such reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Let me say the atmosphere here is great. The ladies at the front counter are superbly nice, I can def go have sushi in my flip flops and feel NO shame for it.. There's people coming in & out (so U know the food must be good) .. I ordered the edamame, fried dumplings, spicy salmon roll, Vegas roll, & an egg roll. The sushi was great except for me, the Vegas roll was a bit much. All of the crunch outside of the roll was really powerful. Also the egg roll was nothing special. Other than that, I will surely be back again to try more delicious economically priced sushi from Tokyo house! 

Really, I'm glad I found a place to enjoy sushi & not go broke while doing it! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst Asian cuisine I have ever had. The Yakisoba was greasy and tasteless, the shrimp fried rice tasted like it was cooked in the same tasteless grease and the miso soup was just as bad. $30 could be spent on much better food than this."}
{"text":"Tried the house chicken which is a brown sauce with mushrooms on top of a bowl of rice.  The chicken was barely there but there were a ton of mushrooms.  The menu indicated it would be spicy but it was not.  Then also got the beef fried rice which had like 4 pieces of beef and maybe needed a little salt/soy sauce.  And had the 2 veggie rolls.  

Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because  the little old man at the register was SUPER nice.  Seems like he remembers his regulars.  He was upbeat and really in charge.  We ate in and there were people in and out of that place like it was a hot spot.

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I was not satisfied."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Not bad, nothing special. However it's a good thing my fiancé and I don't have a food allergy because my chicken fried rice tasted like shrimp and his teriyaki chicken had an egg taste to it. Other than the unexpected flavors it was still really good."}
{"text":"My sister came home one night with an awesome chicken bowl.  I realized it was Tokyo House's House Chicken Bowl.  I am now a loyal fan.  I am a big fan of mushrooms, so this dish hits the spot.  I've invited different family members to this restaurant and they've felt the same I do.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Been coming for years.  Always a solid performer.  Tonight I had the chicken fried rice, which was good.  I also had a cali roll which was terrible.  No more sushi from here for me!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has been poor the past 2 times we have gotten take out.  Old Guy hasn't been there either time, so I'm wondering if new ownership or management.  this evening we go it, and the Chicken Teriyaki is the worst I've ever had.  Maybe they ran out of Teriyaki sauce, and figured they could sneak in Aunt Jamima's in, but wow is it bad.  This ultra sugary fake maple syrup flavor is dreadful.  Will have to explore other options, 2 strikes, and you're out with us."}
{"text":"Tokyo House has changed owners a number of times through the years (as it appears to me) I have been coming.  They are usually polite and courteous, but depending upon who is working and who the owners are, really depends on my satisfaction.

There was a time I would rate this 5 stars, in fact, for many years.  But in the last year or so, I drop it down to 4 stars.  Why you ask?

1.  The prices that they charge aren't always what is posted on the menu that on the board (just behind the counter).  Meaning, the prices are sometimes higher.  I've been told that the price of beef they do charge more for.  Well, their prices on the board should reflect that.

2.  There hasn't been 100% consistency now with the food (at least with what we order), so it depends on who is the chef.  The Katsu bowl has changed.

3.  If you order only \"regular\" sized bowls, you get a very flimsy, thin bag to hold your bowls.  On one occasion, because they packed the bag, the bag broke and our food spilled onto the ground.  They did replace the stuff that was spilled, but really, you need to carry each bag with BOTH hands, which I find to be inconvenient if you have other things you are carrying.

4.  Running out of a menu item.  I wanted Lemon Chicken the other day and they said they were out.  So I ordered Orange Chicken.  Did they run out of lemons and only had orange chicken?  Prior to this year, they have never run out of any item I've ordered.  Another time, they said they no longer sell Sukiyaki Beef.  Huh?  The ingredients in that dish are ingredients that are in other dishes, too.  How is it they don't sell that anymore or did she mean that they aren't cooking anymore of that for the day?  

5.  Their website doesn't work.  Guess they need to pay the fees to keep the website up and didn't.

The food is okay for quickness, which that's what we're going for.  I like the stamps for the cards for every $8 you buy (they also round up when it's slightly less than $8, so that is good).  After every 15th or so $8 you buy, they give you a free UP TO $8.  Unlike places like Rubio's, Joe's BBQ, Joe's Farm Grill or other restaurants that will just deduct the full $8 or whatever the amount is (for the Joe's restaurants it's $10), Tokyo House will deduct the cost of one entree up to $8, so if it's $6, they will give you $6 off.  I can see if that's the only thing you're buying, but if you're buying much more, they should deduct the full $8.

It's just another one of those things that Asian places do to be cheap.  Am I slamming Asians?  Yes.  I'm Asian, but with an American bent.  Sometimes these little things will cause a person to come back or not.  I stopped going to a salon place because after I got my card filled, they renamed the business and wouldn't honor the card.  The employees and everyone were the same, but the name had changed and they wouldn't honor the free $5 off that I got for filling my card with 10 stamps.  Guess it was coincidental that once I got the card filled, they changed names.

I really hate businesses being this petty and this is somewhat typical of Asian places.  Businesses that don't nickel & dime are more likely to keep my business, even if their overall prices are higher."}
{"text":"This is a great place. The teriyaki chicken is the best I've ever had. Tangy, sweet, salty, smoky... The business owner is a genuinely good man who seems to care about everyone.

UPDATE: For those who get takeout, I feel compelled to update my review to give a heads-up to those ordering. The older gentleman always manages the lines perfectly, and helps everyone in a truly remarkable fashion. There is a lady who is sometimes there during the day, however, who does a less stellar job of balancing between the normal and call-ahead lines.

Despite recognizing me, and having what turned out to be my food finished and ready when I got there, I still waited 15 minutes to get it while people who had not called in came in and out, and other people who also had already ordered but were dining in picked up their orders.

I have a limited amount of time during my lunch hour, and many options for food. There's a reason I called ahead, and it isn't to stare at my food getting cold for 15 minutes while people who chose not to have the foresight to do so get served first.

Moral of the story is, great food, just make sure you pointedly ask if that's your food sitting on the counter rather than trusting her to let you know when it's ready."}
{"text":"The best part about living in this part of Chandler is being very close to what many call the \"Asian Mecca\" of the east valley.

There's no shortage of delicious restaurants, grocery stores, tea shops, etc. and you'll be lucky if you get to try them all. Maybe this should be my next bucket list?!
 
That being said, since I moved here just over a year ago . . . I'm kicking myself for not trying Tokyo House sooner! 

When you walk in, it's rather empty. Not a lot of décor, but very clean. Don't let the lack of business scare you away. 102.5 KNIX playing in the background; love it!

The best part of this place is the little old man / owner. He is a riot, very happy and cheerful. Cares about his customers. If you don't know what you're ordering, he'll happily show you a book with pictures. He also suggested we get the combo, as it comes with a drink, egg roll, your dish for just under $7. 

The Dude and I decided to share the Orange Chicken and Chicken Yakisoba.

Ho lee f Batman, best Orange Chicken ever! That other establishment on the other side of Chandler can suck it, because this stuff was amazingly fresh! You could tell someone actually went to the trouble of using fresh oranges instead of some corn syrup-y, jarred garbage.

The owner also said he could make it spicier for us, which was great!

I also really enjoyed the Yakisoba, but will ask for double noodles next time as it's served on white rice.

All of this came out to around $15. 

Tip: They're closed on Sundays. 

Can't wait to try their Teriyaki, Orange Beef, and other dishes. Would make for easy take out."}
{"text":"This place has gone way down the toilet. I used to frequent this place and it was great. Today the water tasted of mold, teriyaki sauce tasted like maple syrup and now i feel sick. Bathroom is super nasty. Wont ever go here again."}
{"text":"I had to put a star otherwise I wouldn't even put one! RUDE RUDE RUDE and horrible customer service. The owner has no customer service skills. They charged me for fried rice extra and gave me white rice and when I called she blamed me and called me a liar and that she checked the order and it wasn't white. I can make better rolls! Disgusting. So much rice and no flavor!! Don't order from this restaurant you will regret it."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for 4 years and the food and service has been consistently amazing. The orange chicken is unlike anywhere else I've tasted. It's crispy and actually tastes like oranges instead of artificial flavoring. The fried rice is another good staple. Almost everything I've tried in Tokyo House has tasted great and the cashier always makes my day with his conversation and attempts to remember everyone's name. Everyone that I've brought to this restaurant gets just as hooked as I have been these past years."}
{"text":"After such good reviews on Yelp, I went to try this out.  I asked the cashier what they would suggest and the customer waiting in line and both said Terrayki chicken was great and the \"best seller\".  I ordered it.  It did have a lot of meat, but it was kind of rubbery.  I couldn't finish the chicken.  Several gristles, which is a deal breaker for me.  The sauce was ok, but very thick.  The white rice was ok, but wasn't much and had a strange flavor to it.  All in all, not a fan, not going back.  Panda Express is better than this place and cheaper."}
{"text":"I ordered a sampling of food off of Door Dash. Orange chicken, crab puffs, and miso soup. The bag came with a little note from the owner! It was copied, but happy little me was delighted. I've worked in restaurants before and there's no way in hell anybody has time to write out a thoughtful note to every customer. (If you do, your business is slow so your food probably sucks.) 

The crab puffs were really tasty! My boyfriend tried a taste and he wasn't incredibly impressed, but I scrumptiously liked them. My only problem was that they could have been warmer, so some heat was lost during the trip from kitchen to mouth. This could be easily fixed with packaging. 

The orange chicken was delicious, too. Having lived in an asian country, the rice was cooked appropriately without seasoning, allowing the chicken to stand out. The chicken was hot and sweet and savory. It wasn't awe-inspiring goodness, but for what I paid, I was completely satisfied. 

The miso soup tasted the way miso soup should. Thanks for cooking tofu properly!Again it was not the most interesting, but when you live in Japan for two years, your standards get pretty obnoxiously high. 

Tokyo House has quite good quality for the price of the food, and I will find myself returning for more."}
{"text":"I've been here many time and tried the sushi for the first time.  Awesome, fresh, a bargin.  What a great suprise.  Can't wait for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm never disappointed! The sushi is my favorite especially for the price!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place based on the reviews and the location, but I just couldn't. It's clean, has nice employees, and my food came out quickly. The beef sukiyaki was not very good. The beef was flavorful, thinly sliced, and tender ... But the gel everything was coated in was so disgusting that I couldn't eat it. The chicken teriyaki was okay... The rice was too over cooked and there wasn't enough teriyaki sauce. Again, not bad, but I'd rather drive a little further for better."}
{"text":"Some of the best teriyaki chicken around.
They also have lemon chicken, orange chicken all at great price."}
{"text":"Been here many times and the little old man is always soo nice.I usually order the orange chicken with steamed rice and vegetables.I don't like too much rice,mostly meat, so he gives me extra chicken every time at no charge.One of the nicest places to go because of the customer service.Always makes me come back for more.Love it!"}
{"text":"Take notes kids. Tokyo House is the only place you should be going for food. literally everything we have ever had here is top notch amazing. Fried rice? Delicious. Teriyaki chicken? To die for. Orange chicken? THE MOST AMAZING THING IN THE WORLD. Plus everything is well priced. It's our go to dinner at least 2 nights a week. They are fast too! Our phone orders are ready within 10-15 minutes every time. You'd be crazy not to jump on this bandwagon."}
{"text":"Ugh. Vege bowl was mostly cabbage and rice and tasteless.

The white meat chicken teriyaki was mostly rice, not enough teriyaki, very thin chicken, and not tasty.

Both dishes came to $15.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp because I was in the mood for some old school Teriyaki Chicken. Was a big fan of Tokyo Express and Blue Fin. This place didn't disappoint. The Teriyaki Chicken rocked!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered food from here through uber eats, so I can't rate the restaurants itself, only the food; but the price is good, the food is good, and it came hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is a great little Japanese hole-in-the-wall that seems to specialize in quality take-out.

When Brak and I walked in, the place was empty and I was ready to be disappointed, despite of the other reviews. The menu had a ton of cooked food (teriyaki, yakisoba, donburi, etc.), and as a sushi eater, I wasn't quite sure what to pick. When I asked what one item meant, the man at the counter (the owner?) said the book would help...and handed me a small photo album with photos of quite a few of the menu items. It was funny and effective.

I was surprised how busy the place is. While I was deciding what to order (3-4 minutes), the phone rang at least three times for take-out. In the half-hour I was in the dining area, at least 15 people picked up orders or sat down for a meal. It appears that they have a strong following, well-earned if the food I had was typical.

I ordered a small shrimp yakisoba and a soda. The taste was good, and even the small order was a huge amount of food. Our orders were really pretty quickly, but it didn't seem like the food was pre-made and sitting on warmers. The service was also really good; I got a kick out of the owner. He was genuinely interested in how we liked our meals.

I suggest this place for a simple, cheap dinner and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"They serve day old rice at times.  Since the ownership had changed things have gotten bad in the area of customer service.  The chicken often has little vibes in it.  The new manager is rude and doesnt speak English well.  She won't take a call from a customer who calls with an issue."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken teryaki (large) with white meat. The chicken was sliced really thin and cooked to perfection! If youre a first timer you might want extra teryaki sauce. The sauce isnt too sweet, more on the savory side. Which is perfect considering most places use 9 bags of sugar for their sauce.

We also ordered the chicken yakisoba (large) the sauce was really good and just the right mix of veggies and noodles (the noodles were somewhat like chow mein noodles)! We ordered white meat chicken, it wasnt deep fried, it was pan fried. (saw another review where the chicken was deep fried?) We prefer it pan fried anyway.

Lastly we purchased pork and chicken fried rice (regular). I was so hoping it would be the marinated pork (usually red) but no big deal because it was still really good! The fried rice was just the perfect sticky texture that I adore, and it came with bits of green onion, egg, celery, etc. Yum!

Inexpensive, fast and friendly! This little corner of heaven will be our new go to for take out! And just as a small heads up, the large sizes come in big styrofoam containers. The regular sizes are in a bowl (about the size of an average cereal bowl).

We've eaten take out from the east and west coast, granted this isnt east coast quality but its still great food. 

Side note, its kinda warm in there, I wouldnt recommend eating here unless the sun is down, Im sure rent is extraordinarily high, unless they prefer it to be a bit warm. :)

Overall, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"I love the food, but if you get take away check your order before you get home.  I've gotten the wrong order on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"I went here based on the other yelp reviews.  
The lemon chicken bowl I had was tasty and cheap, and yes, like the other reviewers the Japanese owner put a smile on my face!  He just seems genuinely interested in every customer :)."}
{"text":"The food was horrible not worth the price. The rice was too mushy and the egg drop soup was bland"}
{"text":"Great food and cheap too
Owner answering the call in spanish was hilarious as well

Finished my very generous portion of teriyaki chicken"}
{"text":"- Great value
- The tonkatsu was ok. I wish they had a tonkatsu curry
- The house special chicken was excellent
- They were out of inari sushi
- Loved the friendly service"}
{"text":"Worst white meat teriyaki chicken i have ever tasted. It was super thin and still it was disgustingly chewy. The golden california roll was not bad and the egg rolls are good. Will just stick with Aloha Kitchen much better food."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome customer service !! I usually call ahead and pick up, never a issue with that. Always has the order made just the way we ask !"}
{"text":"Awesomely delicious rice bowl place.  The teriyaki chicken rice bowl, ordered light on the sauce, is particularly good, as is the orange chicken rice bowl.
I accidentally left my keys here once.  The proprietor was kind enough to hold them for me until I later realized and returned to retrieve them."}
{"text":"Holding firm on 3 stars.  I liked by sushi, over fried.  I liked my noodles, bit stale, I liked my edamame, yet salt was pasted on the top and uneven.

This place was as best towards a college young crowd. Quality was very low. Everything is in styrofoam."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Not that normal grease bucket Chinese food (a la Panda Express)! I like the Tokyo Chicken, but the Teriyaki is really good, too. The man who owns the place, Fu, is SUPER nice and always had a good attitude. I don't think this guy can ever NOT be happy, he makes my day every time! Good place and way cheap. I like how you have the option to get white meat chicken, too."}
{"text":"The fried rice was super salty and smothered in soy sauce.  I ordered the large mongolian beef and it had maybe 7 pieces of beef in there! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"I dont know why my family and I haven't gone here before! They've been here for something around 20+ years - and u can tell (in a good way)! The elderly gentleman in the evening was just very pleasant to deal with. He reminded me of my grandfather; who is VERY Japanese! Food is tender and the flavors are all homemade & not out of a bottle. I will definitely be back as often as possible!! Especially cuz they are absolutely affordable!"}
{"text":"I love Tokyo House! Service is great and food is has been consistently delicious. The ownership change made no difference in food or service provided. Must gets here are: Orange Chicken, Orange Beef, Spicy or regular Teriyaki Chicken, House Fried Rice and Yakisoba. Check in on Yelp for a free appetizer."}
{"text":"I love this place! The gentleman behind the counter is amazingly funny and was entertaining the customers as they came in. The food is authentic and made very fast! I love their house fried rice and their chicken teriyaki is awesome! Would highly recommend this place for a neat fun night!

Very good!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 of the seasonal soups spicy with meat added in for extra, on orange chicken combo and the House chicken combo with a side of fried shrimp.

Seasonal soup had an ok flavor, just not much of one. Had to put in a bit of soy sauce to get some flavor. I enjoyed the house chicken well enough and the orange chicken was very good. Portions are ok at lunch. Soup is huge, entrees the size of a large cup at an ice cream parlor. Overall the food was ok, but not great. Staff was nice but had a bit of a communication issue but easily resolved. May go again if we're around, but not until we try others"}
{"text":"No nonsense teriyaki. Noodles are good, too. My kids enjoy the orange chicken. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place gets such good reviews. The service was terrible, the presentation of the food was unappealing, and the food was awful. The lady at the desk didn't make basic communication like \"how can I help you?\", when she was perfectly capable. The food looked slopped in the styrofoam container, the noodles were greasy, the chicken was dry and over battered, the crab puffs were stale, and the fried rice tasted like they soaked it in a bath of soy sauce. If you're looking for basic asian food, then just go to Tao Garden instead. Its in the same parking lot, and much better."}
{"text":"Healthy food served fast! 
Chilling and relaxing atmosphere conveniently located in and accessible. Happily eating here at 9 AM 5+ years without any disappoint experiences leaving me with only great memories of time well spent with family and friends!"}
{"text":"I have always remembered passing by this establishment and wondering how their food was. One night I was using my Yelp app to navigate me in the right direction for some delicious Japanese food. Luckily, I came across the business page for Tokyo House. I read through all the reviews and continued to see all the great things people had about this place... and the lovely gentleman behind the counter! 

Although, I did not stop by that night ,my curiosity got the best of me and I went back to Tokyo House a couple days later. 
  
Not only was everyone right about the how funny the adorable old man is but they were also right about the down right amazing food! The food is authentic and made very fast! I love their teriyaki bowl and their miso soup. Its just the thing to help warm your belly up on a cold night. I highly recommend this place for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"My go to Japanese spot when I need a fix of yakisoba STAT! It's just so good. My bf loves the fried rice as well. They have never messed up my call in orders and its always ready when I arrive. Easy, quick and delicious dinner.

The older gentleman can't help but make me smile every time I call or go in to pick up food. The first time I called I thought someone was playing a prank on me. He has a total game show host voice..lmao I absolutely love it."}
{"text":"Love the old guy at the counter. Always happy and funny. Foods fresh, fast and cheap."}
{"text":"One of the many little gems in the east valley- I totally agree with everyone about the personality of the cute little older gentleman makin it more than an ordinary takeout experience. We ordered the chicken fried rice and the chicken terriaki- both were tasty. Wasn't expecting the chicken to be fried in the fried rice, but it tasted great. I will be back again soon, it's nice to get great food and service with a smile :)"}
{"text":"Another strip mall gem.  The Zombie Girl and I hit Tokyo House after finding it reviewed here.  It completely lives up to the hype.  The owner is the coolest dude you'd ever want to serve you a meal.  He's got a ton of personality, is polite to a fault, and obviously loves what he does.  There is a large selection of stuff on the menu, all at ridiculously low prices.  I opted for a simple Teriyaki chicken bowl while the Zombie Girl dined on Yakisoba.  The food was fresh and awesome.  I also ordered a Mountain Dew, which the owner read back as \"Dew from a mountain\", awesome!  I returned for lunch the next day and had sweet & sour pork.  Again, everything fresh and flaming hot, obviously not pulled from under a heat lamp.  Went with a \"dew from a mountain\" again, of course.  Looking forward to trying more stuff.  Brak bestows Tokyo House with his coveted 5-star rating, with a supplemental 6th star for the smiling, friendly service."}
{"text":"Kept hearing about this place from a few friends and relatives then decided to give it a try. I ordered what everyone recommended which was the orange chicken,orange beef,chicken fried rice and chicken yakisoba with double noodle and I have to say they were all right! Not only was the food really good but the service was great! I finally got to meet the legendary man at the front that they all kept saying was the nicest owner/host/cashier ever and he did not disappoint! He lives up to the hype and I will definitely be returning! My kids loved it so this is a good family spot incase you were wondering :-)"}
{"text":"Not sure how my partner found this place. It definitely is a hidden gem. We've been here about four times so far, each time it has not disappointed me nor my innards. Since moving to Arizona, it's been a task finding a tasty Asian hole in the wall to eat at. I think we may have found it. The decor is simple, clean, super friendly staff and very welcoming. When calling for take out, they are on point with the cook time. Try it out if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"As a Seattle to Phoenix/Mesa transplant, I was nervous to find a decent teriyaki place. Asian food of any variety can be so hit or miss. Tokyo House was stupendous! Amazing teriyaki and gyoza exactly how gyoza is supposed to be. Clean, friendly staff, excellent iced tea. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Ever on the go for some decent eel sushi and delicious crab puffs?  Well, here is the place"}
{"text":"I only get the chicken or house fried rice but so far so good, my order is always right, it's quick, and I love seeing Amy! Brightens my day every time she's the best"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the food has always been good the prices fair and the service exceptional.  it appears there is new management, the food is bad, and I say that with all sadness.  The teriyaki sauce is watered down a lacks flavor, the Yakasoba is dry.  Very sad.  The staff is OK but not near where it used to be. too bad.  my suggestion pass on this place.  You will see that all the good reviews are old."}
{"text":"The combination of the food, and the great attitude of the owner are priceless.  Every time I walk in there I walk out with great food for a great price, and a smile on my face.  
I can feed my whole family for $20 and after a long, cold and dreary day at work I walk in and the owner says to me: \"So vibrant despite the cold\".  And then keeps referring to me as \"oh, vibrant one\".  I think I'm falling in love..."}
