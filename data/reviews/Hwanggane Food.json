{"text":"They appear to specialize in noodle dishes, with their own \"hand made\" noodle soups. Most of the soups seem to be seafood or veggie based. They also have some rice dishes that come with meat.

Ordered the handmade noodles that was advertised with vegetables.
Came in a large bowl with a lot of noodles and some vegetables, but the taste was just ok. Very light flavour.

Given the number of korean restaurants in the area I'd rather go to one of those for a meal."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such low reviews because I just finished having an awesome meal there! I got the eel on rice and it was so good. It's a traditional Japanese dish with korean fusion twists. Instead of just eel on rice with radish and ginger, they used purple rice and saut√©ed it with egg, onions, and green onion. Super flavourful and filling. Rice also came with a miso soup and some side dishes. Will definitely come back to try their kimbap and dumplings!"}
{"text":"Just a heads up, this place and Osaka Sushi are essentially the same place. They share a kitchen and a work staff. You order at the same place and you pick up at the same place. The difference is that they have their Korean menu under this store sign, and their Japanese menu under the Osaka Sushi sign.

I ordered the fried seaweed rolls ($4.99 for a large). Its Korean name is gimmari, if I'm not mistaken. It's japchae (sweet potato noodle) rolled in seaweed, tempura battered, and fried. It's common to find this paired with spicy rice cakes (dukbboki), if I'm not mistaken. Anyways, I ordered it, and the price wasn't too bad for the portion. I have to say that the York Mills Galleria does it better (they serve it with their ready to go dukbboki). Here, it was passable, but not fantastic. It wasn't crispy enough, and the batter was a tad thick. They were nice enough to serve it with the dukbboki sauce on the side, even though I didn't order dukbboki. The sauce was lovely, if a tad thin. It's sweet and spicy and was great with the rice I had from my pork katsu bento (see my Osaka Sushi review for more info). 

We had a service error here too. I gave the girl at the register the name of this item in English, and also gave her the menu item number. She got it wrong. If you read my Osaka Sushi review, you'll notice that I said the same thing there. I'm not talking about the same mistake. She did it with both items. It's okay. She double checked with me, and I'm thankful that she did. It helps that their register has a screen facing outward that shows what you ordered (in both English and Korean, if I'm not mistaken). For those of you who didn't read the Osaka Sushi review and won't bother do (I don't mind if you don't), other than that, service was lovely. I asked for and received an extra pair of chopsticks and a bowl (I didn't ask for a spoon or tissue, but she gave those to me too), and I also got a cup of water (hot and cold) on another trip. Each trip, I was given service with a smile. A smile goes a long way. 

I believe I saw budae jjigae (army stew - think Korean ramen + sausage + spam + assortment of other items in a spicy broth) for less than $20 for 2 people. I'm a budae jjigae fan, so that piqued my interest. I'll probably be back to try it if I want to have that in a food court setting."}

Hwanggane Food Inc. is a Korean Fast Food joint located inside in Galleria Supermarket in Thornhill. 

I was surprising how busy it is on a Saturday evening... good prices, fast services and decently good food are always popular. Especially if Family can just eat then shop for grocery in one location!

Kal Guk Soo ($6.99)
- Photo looks like a veggie delight. But without the English translations... the nice Korean man said it is veggie and taste good... and is not spicy and the broth is hot... sounded good!
- Of course the real thing is NEVER as good as the photo... just a few mushrooms, carrot, onion, egg and seaweed..... 
- The noodle though was cooked quite well, chewy and has bite 

Today Special - Spicy Chicken Hot Pot Stew ($6.99 instead of $7.99)
- Tons of Potatoes and a bowl of rice on the side!! Carbs attack!! You for sure will be full after eating that... 
- 1/4 chicken in the order with a mixture of dark and white meat... 
- The broth itself though look Bright RED (my yelp friend was sweating just looking at it) but it is not Korean style spicy... think sweet and with a hint of pepper and soybean...good to mix to eat with rice
- The problem with this stew was the chicken was just dumped into the broth and just boil them until they are cooked... (My style of cooking with zero skill) 
- SKIP!!

Eating inside Galleria Supermarket's food court does give me a feel of being in somewhere in Seoul. 

I don't mind dropping by Hwanggane Food to try out other noodles if I am in the area but probably won't be making a special trip just for that!

They accepts Visa and MasterCard!"}
{"text":"Had the special - handmade noodles with only veggies.  Not much veggies though.

Nothing very special, plain soup broth.  Come with two Korean side dishes - pickled radish and kimchi.

Service was typically - fine.  

Nothing special or out of the ordinary.

It was quick and a decent lunch."}
