{"text":"Charming little place with amazing pastries! We stopped by an hour before closing and were warmly welcomed. I had the mille feuille, my favorite pastry of al time and how I base if a patisserie is up to snuff. It was perfect! My husband had some pastry with praline, apricot, and speculoos, which was just the perfect amount of sweetness and a masterful balance of creamy and crunchy as well as sweet and tart. We left with two caneles that I had the next day, and they were still deliciously chewy and crispy. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The pastries are out of this world good and have a very simple yet creative brunch menu. Nicely designed and located on a quiet street in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"From what I learnt later.  You pay an extra $1.50 per item when you decide to eat in. My advice, take it to go unless you want slow service. You save tipping them."}

Christian Faure is a highly renowned pastry chef who has won many prestigious awards around the world. He holds the title Meilleur Ouvrier de France Glacier (M.O.F.), the highest title a pastry chef can hold, and is the President of the M.O.F. Society of North America.

Montreal has very few places to enjoy authentic French desserts, and I'm glad I tried Maison Christian Faure before I left. The pastry shop also has savoury options, including a small weekend brunch menu for those that love sweet desserts like me.

Because Maison Christian Faure was known for their sweet pastries, we decided to skip their savoury selection and enjoy the sugary things. The waiter brought over a huge tray of all of their desserts for us to choose from, and patiently waited for me to take a picture :D. He said everyone asks for a picture anyway, so now he just waits even before people ask. 
Anyway, hubby and I both had a difficult time trying to pick out one...actually no, my husband knew what he wanted - the flan cake. I on the other hand, really took a long time choosing because I'm horrible at making decisions in front of dessert like that.

Nevertheless, I ordered the lemon meringue tart and peppermint tea while my husband also ordered an Americano.

I didn't get my own teapot, which was a little disappointing, however the waiter did come over and prepare my tea (teabag, pouring the hot water, etc). Little things like this made me very happy, because I felt like I was getting good service.

Our desserts came out pretty quickly, and my lemon meringue tart was too pretty to eat. It had just the right amount of sweetness and overall it was kept very light because of the fresh lemons. The tart shell was a tad bit too hard for my taste, as it was quite difficult to break into pieces, but it was still well done. Halfway through my tart, my husband and I realized that the meringue was probably made from uncooked egg whites so we didn't finish the tart. I was really sad at this point, but hubby cheered me up by letting me order another dessert.

Hubby's flan cake was very delicious as well, and it was one of the least sweet options they had. It was quite moist and both of us really enjoyed it as it wasn't as sweet as the other desserts we had ordered. We would recommend this to you if you don't have as big of a sweet tooth like I do.

My second choice of dessert was their hazelnut eclair, which was one of the best hubby and I had ever tasted! I was so glad I made this choice because this ended up being better than the lemon meringue tart even though I enjoyed that very much. As you can see from the picture above, the eclair had whole hazelnuts in it within the filling, and it really made a huge difference in terms of the dessert's texture and flavour. The cream filling was also really delicious... it was very much like having a real ferrero rocher in your mouth! Hubby enjoyed this eclair very much as well - and I think we'd both agree that this was our top dessert of the three we had ordered. Very much recommended!

Aside from all the pretty pastries, Maison Christian Faure also had an assortment of cakes and macarons to enjoy. We didn't get a chance to try them (#sugaroverdose) but I would imagine they be high quality and delicious.
I wish I had taken a picture of their brunch menu :(, because it is not available online. Overall, though our dessert date was a tad expensive, we thoroughly enjoyed it very much! The service we received was great - our server was very attentive, and it felt like I was in a much luxurious dessert cafe in France. As its location is in Old Montreal, it's perfect to drop by for some sugar while enjoying your day out in the sun now that the weather is nice! It's perfect for a romantic date as well with your significant other, your girlfriends, or with your mom - perfect place to take your mom for Mother's Day coming up! 

Street parking is available when you can get a spot."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and it was right around the corner from the hotel I was staying at.  I wanted some french pastry and this place had it.  They had a bunch of fancy stuff but I opted for a chocolate croissant with almond slices on top and some creme filling. Holy crap!!!! Best. Chocolate. Croissant. Ever."}
{"text":"Come here and Treat yo' self! Indulge in the decadence.

Came here for a small treat, we were lucky to get a table for five right away. The waitress promptly served us and brought the pastry tray to mesmerize us, it worked. I ordered the passion fruit tart which is out of this world. I also tried a friend's panna cotta, it was exquisite but the passion fruit tart was just perfection. This all went down very well with my $5 hot chocolate (It's the old port, you pay the premium)."}
{"text":"As chic as this place is, the service is friendly and casual. The space was much smaller than I thought so arrive a bit early for lunch if you want to dine in. The lobster and crab pate a choux was very fresh and beautifully arranged. The desserts are gorgeous and delicate. I highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"The smell in this place is like heaven.  Someone should really bottled the smell of fresh pastries up and sell it as a air freshener.  I will be the first in line for that. 

The chocolate croissant here was the best i ever had.  Hard to describe but it was so much better than the one at Pillards in Quebec.   

Another good item was the raspberry tart.  Very tangy but so good.  

A little disappointed in the eclair.  People were saying on Yelp that it was a must try.  After taking several bites, it was nothing to really get excited about. 

They had lots of macaroons but they are not my thing.  So didn't really try it. 

Price wise, all French pastry seems to have prices very consistent.  They tend to be higher than most non French ones and this place was no exception. 

Will i come back... yes.  There were so many more items i wanted to try but was just too full to do it."}
{"text":"Sooooo gooooddd. They make everything fresh in the morning. The guy told me no left over - which is nice! 

It's a bit pricey but it's worth it. Service can be improved tho. 

Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Not bad. The burger le chic is good. It's just near the hotel. But the waiting time is a little long..."}
{"text":"as soon as you enter the store, the smell alone captivates the senses. the hype, the decor, and all the great reviews are backed up by one-of-a-kind pastries. although on the expensive side, you will not find anything like them elsewhere. we did not dine-in, nor did we try any drinks/coffee, so i can't speak to the level of service or the quality of their drinks, but the pastries are worth the visit."}
{"text":"Best place for coffee and dessert in Old Montreal!  I stopped by every day and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Had a brunch yesterday. It was really good . Fantastic food quality and service. 
Canelets are awesome . Hot chocolate too"}
{"text":"The lobster is a must - what an awesome idea to take a lobster roll and put it into a pastry. The flavors work together very well. Exceptional attention to detail and the dish comes out like a masterpiece you're hesitant to bite into - enjoying how well it's put together visually. 

If you do get a dish that comes with caramel - it's sooooo good!"}
{"text":"We just happened to find this place while on a walk in the neighborhood. Loved it! Some of us had the set lunch which included a pastry. Best deal! Another person had the Salad Nicoise. Everything we ate was so delicious (and so beautiful), from the entrees to the drinks to the pastries! We wanted to go back here on our last day in Montreal but time did not permit. We were so sad!"}
{"text":"I've never had a better croissant - I had almond and chocolate almond. We went 2 days in a row because it was so good. Great tea selection, we tried the macarons too - amazing. Can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"Magnificent! 
You just have to try it for yourself. My husband and I tried their club sandwich so good!!
The pastries are the best. 
It was my first time trying the brioche and I'm addicted. It's my favorite! 
Chef Christian Faure and his team are wonderful and very passionate. So much love in their food! 
Bravo!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing . Like a previous yelper, we must have taken the invisible pills, because service was awful.  Took forever to get seated , stating that they had to clean up the tables , then after 10 minutes said \" or you can sit here\" at a table that had already been set up when we first walked in.  Had to ask multiple times to take our order.  Had the chocolate crossaints, meh.  Hot chocolate was good.  Orange juice was good had to ask for it a few times before it came.   Had the Madelines that was supposed to come with home made jam but it never came.  No utensils given so we got up and got them ourselves.  Server brought the dessert tray to many surrounding tables around us, but somehow never made it over.  All in all service was so disorganized that it left a everything a bit meh.  Pass on this one for now.  Did get a nice note from the staff, they are indeed working on the service.  Nice to see they care, but hopefully they can improve to make the experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"Assez dispendieux (environ 6$ la pâtisserie), mais cela vaut tout à fait la peine! Les desserts sont vraiment uniques. En une simple bouchée, on reconnaît immédiatement la qualité de ces petites merveilles. J'aime spécialement l'éclair aux fraises, qui offre un goût à la fois léger et savoureux."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé avec ma mère pour une expérience \"brunch et pâtisseries\" car ma mère adore les pâtisseries de bonne qualité et c'était son anniversaire. Je fais cette évaluation dans le but d'avertir les gens qui veulent savoir la vérité sur ce commerce, car la haute évaluation qui existe sur Internet est fausse à mon avis. J'aurais donné une étoile, mais j'ai adoré leurs gâteaux.
L'expérience brunch: J'ai été extrêmement déçue (j'ai commandé le menu brunch Royal : le choux avec uf bénédictine et saumon, salade de fruits et pain doré avec un choix de croissant). L'uf bénédictine  - tout était mou, il n'y avait aucun élément croustillant, et il y avait une espèce de mousse blanche qui était de trop, alors je me suis retenue de vomir car c'était vraiment pas agréable en bouche. La salade de fruits était très bonne mais le pain doré était petit et le caramel qui venait avec était excellent par contre. Encore là; ça prouve ce que je vais mentionner plus bas : ils sont forts dans les gâteaux mais les brunchs ne sont pas au même niveau. Ma mère avait commandé un sandwich (poulet et bacon). Il était froid et à notre plus grande surprise il était entouré de croustilles de patates. Je m'excuse mais pour l'expérience chic qui est promise dans leur branding, je ne voyais pas du tout des croustilles de patates. Très décevant et je m'attendais à beaucoup mieux. Si vous promettez une expérience chic, alors il faut y mettre le paquet surtout qu'on paye pour cette expérience \" chic \". 
L'expérience service: La serveuse était polie, mais le service très lent, la serveuse avait l'air dans sa boule, elle ne nous a pas demandé si on aimait, il a fallu que je demande qu'on nous serve de l'eau, on nous apporte des verres de hauteur moyenne, remplis à un quart de leur volume. Donc je fus très déçue aussi par leur service. Encore, l'expérience chic demande aussi un service à la hauteur. 
Café : J'ai commandé un latté et il était bon. Rien à dire là-dessus. Leur café est de bonne qualité.
L'expérience pâtisserie/gâteau: J'ai choisi un croissant au beurre, j'ai déjà mangé beaucoup mieux, déçue car il n'avait rien de spécial. À Montréal, on peut facilement trouver de très bons croissants. Je n'ai pas goûté leurs autres choix de pâtisseries, donc je ne me prononcerais pas là-dessus mais le croissant est le symbole de la France alors voilà...Les deux gâteaux qu'on a demandés, j'ai adoré. Donc, ce sont les gâteaux qui ont sauvé le tout. Rien à dire là-dessus, la mention du meilleur pâtissier de France n'a pas déçue. Je vous suggère d'acheter leurs gâteaux, vous payerez plus cher de les manger sur place mais le décor chic en vaut la chandelle. Sinon, pour emporter c'est une très bonne idée. 
Le décor : Chic, lumineux, très jolie place. Rien à dire là-dessus. Ils ont bien réussi le décor. 
Prix: extrêmement cher, ne pas oublier que les gâteaux coûtent 6$ chaque et si on se fait servir à table, le prix augmente à 8,50$, ce qui est énorme. Exagéré, vraiment. Mais sur le menu, le prix de 8,50$ est-il mentionné? Je ne pense pas...peut-être je me trompe...Donc je comprends que je dois payer plus cher quand je m'attends à une expérience de classe, mais franchement le brunch et le service n'étaient pas du tout dignes de cette mention.
En conclusion: à améliorer - Ils devraient servir des brunchs d'une meilleure qualité, enlever les croustilles de patates et remplacer avec quelque chose de plus élégant s'ils veulent garder leur promesse d'une expérience \"chic\". Ce que j'ai aimé : leur décor, leurs gâteaux. Je reviendrais surement pour acheter leurs gâteaux sur place mais pas pour le brunch ou autre chose. 
En espérant que mes commentaires seront utiles autant pour les consommateurs que pour la direction de ce commerce."}
{"text":"The MOF title says it all. People are lucky to have Monsieur Faure in Montreal so they can have an authentic french pastry experience, just like in Paris, minus the flight.

2 stars are taken off due to service. Wait stuff needs to improve in efficiency, attention to detail, and sense of responsibility. 

Weekly customer at this place. Last time I ordered a birthday cake 1 week before the pick up date. Everything was written on their note. And the waiter somehow was confused about the date. He called me and I said 3 times the exact same date,loud and clear. He seems skeptical for some unknown reason and finally said ok. 

On my delivery date, I picked it up and went home without checking the cake. BIg mistake. For the first time in my life I witnessed a cake melted into saggy,runny water, on my leather roadster's seat. Why would I put a cake on my car seat? Because they always stays firm and never was any water coming out of the box. This means the cake is not made fresh. It was either mistakenly put in room temperature for too long, or they made it days in advance it collapsed. 

After I arrived home, cleaned up the mess, then opened the box. The \"happy b day\"card was nowhere to be found, which I specified during ordering. Great. So I called, and the guy said he forgot. Just like that. Forgot. And he asked me to go to the boutique myself to pick it up. I live in south shore and they are downtown. I said I can't it's far. and he said \"that's too bad. Nothing else I can do.\" Really?! Nothing else you can do huh..Why am I the one that needs to go there when it's his mistake? People only has one birthday per year. The card was meant to be special and personal, now it's just a saggy cake. 

The cake turned out only lasted a day. The 2nd day it was sour. (I did put it in the fridge when not consuming) Another proof it's not fresh. What I can say. Next time I'd open the box and check everything there. Can't be trusted."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in old montreal, walking into this pastry joint was simply mouth-watering as you see the sweets on display that looked delicious, savory and colourful. 

The decor was very elegant and French. Felt very cozy and comfortable.

Once seated, they bring you a plate of all their sweets for you to choose - all looking very delicious. My favourite was the hazelnut eclair -- tasted like a mouth full of Ferro Roche."}
{"text":"Service: poor service. Lack of direction/instructions. Nothing was labeled describing the pastries. No price listed for anything. It costs more to have your coffee in house versus take out by almost $1! Macaroons were just ok. For the price I felt the flavors were just bleh and texture wise, not the delicate pillowy softness of a great macaroon. We tried two other pastries they were ok. Because the lack of service and labeling of the product, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our brunch here.  The pastries were excellent, the coffee was nice, and the atmosphere was pleasant."}
{"text":"Quand on entre chez Christian Faure, l'odeur du sucre et des croissants vient nous frapper de plein fouet nous annonçant qu'il y a des délices à venir. Difficile de trouver mieux en terme de bonnes sucreries. Je suis tombée en amour avec leurs pâtisseries et ce n'est pas peu dire. De bonne qualité, à petit prix doux, les pâtisseries de Christian Faure sont un délice.

Ils offrent aussi un snacking-bar chic. Des plats salés délicieux préparés simplement sans trop de chichis et ça, j'apprécie! J'ai mangé un délicieux tartare et je dois dire que j'ai adoré. C'est sans prétention et c'est surtout très généreux pour 15$. Le menu change selon les saisons alors j'ai hâte de retourner pour l'automne!

Mention spéciale à la limonade à l'eau de rose. Elle me rappelle celle de ma grand-mère libanaise. Acidulée et florale en même temps. C'est le paradis."}

All the sweets they have are delicious!! The taste is delicate and it's just perfect. I don't know how to explain even more!!  I'll be back here for sure ~~!"}
{"text":"Stupidest service - we were there for brunch and it was fairly empty we we're served by 6 servers none of whom were dedicated to our table and that was by design because there was more than a 1 to 1 ratio of table to servers and no one else had a dedicates server. All we wanted was for someone to bring the pastry tray to us and they never passed that on - gave us our bill even though we didn't ask for it then when we asked to see the tray they decided to play telephone tag across the 6 servers asking each other to bring it to our table so 10 min later still no tray and the answer oh I told him to do it and she told her to do it.  (are we in elementary school)

Just take out and save yourself the headache of dealing with the untrained staff who can't coordinate taking a pastry out of the glass and a tray to the table..."}
{"text":"I'll echo other's here from the start and frame this place as one of the best patisseries in the world. I've been to many in Paris, Montpellier, Nice, and Leon France -  all the way to Japan and MCF blew me away. 

On 2 visits I spent about 150$, tried almost everything they had. From the get go, any tart you get here will be expertly done and taste amazing. Some are seasonal, some are not, I would just go in and get what looks good to you.

Despite how amazing everything is, the real standout for me were their almond croissants. They are a spiritual experience. HUGE, almond past base filled, little beauties. 4 dollars a pop and worth every cent.

Better yet is this place's location, right in Old Montreal across the street from the river. When it is busy it might be packed inside but if weather permits there is plenty of outside places to sit on some steps and take in the views. 

The staff here were super super nice, very engaging and a lot more down to earth than some of the Toronto patisseries with their pretentious vibe IMO. It was a pleasure to come here and eat on my first trip to Montreal, and officially have a \"MY\" patisserie that I will always visit now when in town and to recommend also."}
{"text":"The macaroons here lack flavor though are beautiful but it's the almond croissant and other pastries that are a joy to behold. The staff are very kind and attentive and gave great service."}

Gâteau au chocolat  a faire saliver!
Il faut absolument arrêter quand on est dans

{"text":"Amazing pastries!!!! This place really does deserve a 5 star. The chef is absolutely down to earth and really cares about the qualify of the product. Although the customer service needs some improvement. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Spent a week in Montreal, everyday seeking good French pastries (the sweet, delicately prepared type) - including using the internet and hotel staff recommendations. We kept striking out until we finally found this place on Yelp.  This was WORTH THE TRIP this afternoon, the last day of our special trip to Montreal. We had two pastries plus cappuccino and took two to go for dinner.  Extremely tasty and the staff was friendly.  Place was very clean and had good ambiance.  We HIGHLY recommend for anyone seeking delicious French pastries.   They also served regular food such as salads, soups and sandwiches, but we did not try.

GREAT JOB guys, hope to visit next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Every product looked exquisite when you walked through the doors. The menu prices for dining in also looked quite reasonable (and tasty). Purchased lovely croissants, macaroons and a lemon meringue tart (although it's referred to as something else here). Very helpful service at the counter."}
{"text":"A terrific little bakery in a beautiful space in old town, near the (awesome) archaeology museum. The $10 breakfast special - coffees, fresh OJ, pastries of your choice - was a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS. Best desserts, pastries and coffee ever. We arrived a Wednesday morning, it was packed, not enough seats. We decided to order out. We spent about 50.00 dollars on desserts but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Very rude service, would not recommend. Products are okay but for the price you might as well support another store"}
{"text":"Very bad cakes! Over-priced! Poor quality! Dough is very hard. Flavour is very very faint. Cheap complements. Looks better than it tastes....I had been used to eating cakes of the Gascogne, and these cakes are far from equal quality! Too bad! :("}
{"text":"Food 5/5 decor 3/5 staff&service 3/5
Great decor, had the chocolate croissant and the chocolatine, they were soooo good and fresh. Definetly intend on going there for brunch!!"}
{"text":"The almond croissant was delightful. They gave me an amuse-bouche as well that was some kind of pate tart, it was actually somewhat similar to the item I ordered. I was actually worried it was the actual dish! Luckily I overheard another server offer the same thing to another patron.

Overall, a great little place."}
{"text":"Love living in Montreal and having places like this to go to. This is a must try. Have a tea with a pastry, there are so many to chose from. I honestly think you cannot go wrong. Everything is good. My favourites are the pastries with lemon but I've had the others too and every bite was heaven."}
{"text":"Overrated joint. The desserts were just OK, and the service was appalling. Slow and inefficient staff who take their own sweet (no pun intended) time with everything. It was a rainy day so the place was not busy. Despite this, the staff (yep, all of 'em) seemed to have trouble doing their jobs effectively. Ask for a menu, no menu till 10 minutes later. Ask for the bill, and he says \"Sure\" but never gets around to doing it. What are all of you getting paid to do?"}
{"text":"Out of this world desserts. We got a box of four gorgeous pastries as well as a canele and croissant. Everything was incredibly tasty and picture-perfect! A bit pricey, but worth it for the ingredients and the attention to detail in presentation. 

Lots of families enjoying brunch/lunch when we dropped in. That will have to wait for our next trip!"}
{"text":"Delicious on a cold winter morning! Pastries were fresh and warm when we sat down at 8am when they open, attentive service and fantastic atmosphere. Chocolate croissant warm out of the oven was the best we've ever had."}
{"text":"La maison Christian Faure est une charmante adresse à visiter. Que ce soit pour se delecter d'une de leurs patisseries, pour un lunch ou brunch, vous serez ravis. 

Leurs patisseries sont à s'en lécher les doigts! L'eclair vanille-framboise ou le nougatier, deux choix très gourmands et très savoureux. Toutes les patisseries sont disponibles en format gateau sur commande. Le délicieux Paris-Brest est un superbe gateau très apprecié des convives.

Le brunch royal est très complet et intéressant, je recommande. Le cafe est très bon, préparé avec soin et accompagné d'un choix de viennoiseries. Le benedictine est raffiné servi avec pain dore delicieux, fruits et sirop d'erable. 

Le menu lunch a lui aussi de quoi plaire avec des salades inventives que j'essaierais une autre fois."}
{"text":"Marvelous food. Friendly. Beautiful restaurant interior.  My crab and lobster salad sandwich was excellent and garnished nicely.  Daily special was a value; today was a pork sandwich.  Roast beef sandwich uniquely had a hard boiled egg included. Service was slower than expected."}
{"text":"Very nice bakery close to notre dame...great place for quick breakfast or afternoon coffee.  Try their almond croissant"}
{"text":"I've never understood the hype around macaroons until I tried them from this bakery. Worth every penny and I will be stopping by again before my flight back home!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I need to review this place since it's so popular already, but it's just that good that I feel the need to share how much I love about Maison CF.  

Everything here from the beautiful and delicate desserts to the savoury items are all prepared with love and dedication.  Just because it's a salad, doesn't mean it shouldn't be pretty.  And not only the presentation is beyond perfect, the food itself is also amazing.  I usually don't go there for the desserts (I know, silly me), but I go there for the brunch/lunch and pastries.  The $20 brunch menu was worth every penny...with choice of any drink, pastry, a Benedict of your choice (ham or salmon) with the fresh toast on the side, fruit salad and caramel sauce.  T

We also went there on Christmas day for the special Christmas brunch. The salmon and beef baked in puff pastry were both divine, so was the potato gratin on the side and the green beans. The normal lunch menu... the lobster and crab puff pastry thing was beautiful, although I am not a big fan of their puff pastry itself, it seems dried and hard to eat, but the dish was pretty and still would order it just so I can take another picture :)  The club sandwich was the best I've ever had.  The execution from the perfectly toasted bread to everything inside was amazing.  They ran out of turkey that day, so I was lucky enough to substitute to the roast beef. It's not your regular deli roast beef thin slices...it's like prime rib slices and to die for.  Best sandwich I've ever had, even the potato chips on the side.  

The execution of all the dishes were carefully thought of and they've done it beautifully.  The place is small, can be overwhelming at times if you're waiting for a table, not a lot of space to stand around while you have a bunch of people coming in to buy pastries/desserts to go.  But all the staff are friendly and even though it's a big tourist trap... I am happily to be trapped inside.  It's just too good.  And it's also great to see Monsieur Christian there most of the time either at the kitchen or talking to people at the counter.  Also a very nice man to take picture with!  Great job."}

{"text":"Had their chocolate almond croissant and it was amazing! So light and buttery and oh my how chocolaty.

If you're looking for a light breakfast then head out here. Perfect spot for a coffee/latté before heading out to the old port"}
{"text":"Great bakery, makes you want to eat slowly and enjoy the taste, pricey, service a bit rushed, will come back"}
{"text":"For a renowned restaurant, I expected better service and food in general. This weekend's experience was subpar and the general environment at the front pastry area was chaotic (manager barking orders at staff, dirty counter with milk splattering all over the place as lattes were being made , lattes being made with improper proportions of milk that was just poured at random amounts etc). Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing! I made sure to make the time to stop by this beautiful and charming shop, and I am so glad that I did. I got four different pastries- a caramel and dark chocolate tart, which was perfect- not too sweet, and beautiful; a lemon meringue tart, which was lovely; a cannele, which the friendly man who packaged up my treats helped to pronounce properly (my French is pretty much non-existent); and a delectable croissant. Then, as I was signing my receipt, the cashier suggested I take a sample of their marshmallows. I decided on the spot to buy a bag of the vanilla marshmallows, but he suggested I try the raspberry. Totally amazing! I whipped out my credit card right there and bought a bag. I wish I didn't live 4000 miles away, because I already want more!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd trip here. We loved the first visit, food and pastries were amazing. This time around, we ordered the lobster sandwich and were bitterly disappointed. They've dramatically reduced the amount of lobster. For $18CAD I expect a lot more than 1 lobster claw meat in my sandwich. The service was top notch and pastries still great, but the over priced, underwhelming sandwich drags this place down."}
{"text":"The cakes were delicious but not something you can't find elsewhere with the price. Service was terrible. We were seated and were only given a drink menu. We waited for 10 mins with no service. We requested a menu and that was another 10 mins wait. Finally, a waiter approached us with a tray of cakes for us to choose from. We made our selections and it took another 10 mins before we got our food. Since the cakes were already made, I don't understand why it took so long for them to bring them to us. Finally, it was the time to pay and it meant more waiting. I asked for the check and 10 mins later still nothing. To avoid more waiting with no service, I went up to the register and tried to pay, no staff was there. Finally, a waiter showed up and he asked us what we ordered. There were only 3 tables that haven't paid yet and he had to ask us which table it was. I won't go back to this place again. I have tried better French bakeries elsewhere with way better service."}
{"text":"Service is absurd. I liked the dessert but i was so upset i had to stop eating. 

- waitresses ignored me for minutes despite the place wasnt busy. Until a gentleman finally greeted me. I felt like I didnt exist and should have left and trusted my gut feeling.
- They served my husband's lunch within two minutes. It was a cold club sandwich from the fridge and dont tell me it is freshly made. Toasted bread is not supposed to be cold. There is no way a club sandwich should be done within 3 minutes. Subway sandwich even took longer. 
- They didnt even take my pastry order after my husband's sandwich came out. 
- Took my own tea bag out but not served hot water. 
- Why would you serve the food first before drinks?
- Waiting for 8 minutes already and noone came to us for the machine for the check. We paid by cash at the end and left.

I know I don't speak French or even look French, not sure if that is why they treated us this way. Felt quite discriminated in the whole experience. 

Only staff that was friendly was the tall gentleman. 

Please know for a place like this with tourists, we expect a LOT more."}

We were there for a breakfast snack at around 10 am on a weekday and the case was full so we had the full selection available to choose from. 

We selected the blueberry tart and an almond croissant. Both were good. My favorite part of breakfast? My terrific cup of very hot, dark, boldly flavored coffee. It was the perfect foil for the richness of the croissant. 

On the way out, I purchased a few more items to try later including an apple pastry -- that was apparently a shocking $12! My other half ate the whole thing so I'm not sure why it cost 3x as much as my croissant but it was reportedly tasty. There are no prices on the pastries so I suppose you should ask if you don't want any surprises sprung on a stupid non-French speaking tourist like me.  :(

One other tip: there's a menu of breakfast options posted English discretely on one of the walls. It seems that there is some sort of set breakfast that includes juice,  coffee, and pastry -- Unfortunately,  I only saw this as we were leaving. Next time perhaps!"}
{"text":"DO NOT TRY THIS PLACE?TOOOOOOOO RUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! STRONG DISCRIMINTION ON ASIAN PPL! Ignore all the way till leaving the store and give you no chance to ask any questions. We kept waiting till all the other ones who are not Asian  get into the store after us but all being seated before us, which is really a bad image of Montreal and Canada!"}
{"text":"Incredible pastries and viennoises. The almond and chocolate croissant is DIVINE. Coffee and espressos are lovely and do the trick but I confess I had better elsewhere. But then again, that's not their wheelhouse, so I wasn't disappointed but will admit a stellar coffee would have earned five stars. Multiple locations so find one and go--it's a place not to miss while you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"The line in the bakery was so confusing. I could not figure out which line is to wait for a table and where is the line to order takeout. The cakes are nice. I ordered an almond one and a chocolate cake with raspberry jam. Also packed a dozen macaron to go. Those were really nice"}
{"text":"The macarons were very stale, the lady fingers were average.  This is a small sample size of their many desserts, but still disappointing.  Good service."}
{"text":"We were walking around the Old Port and it started to rain. We chose this pastry place to get out of the rain. We had no expectations other than wanting to stay dry and eat a snack. Well, we were lucky to find this spot because all the pastries looked fantastic. I was in the mood for some ice cream though. We got the dark chocolate ice cream and mango ice cream. Both were delicious and creamy. I highly recommend the dark chocolate (I normally do not like dark chocolate, but this was really good). I also tried their lemonade, and it was average. I will return next time to try some of their pastries (I was \"pastried out\" cause I ate pastries all week in Montreal)."}
{"text":"Passion fruit tart and lemon meringue tart are the best. Went back for seconds. Gotta try the strawberry marshmallows as they are very delicious."}
{"text":"Walked by on our first day in Montreal.  Made a mental note and returned the next morning for a quick bite en route to bota bota.

Their almond croissant is unlike any other I've tasted.  It's got this creamy paste thing in the center that was just out of this world.  If there was a way for me to ensure that the flaky crusts would remain fresh and crisp, I'd definitely import a few dozen of their goods back to nyc!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out based on a recommendation from our hotel. Was an amazing little spot.  Had the ham and cheese croissant and the chocolate and almond croissant. 

Staff was very friendly and very helpful on helping us making the right decision.  And was even friendly at my attempt at French.  

Also picked up homemade marshmallows and chocolate orange peels as gifts which were awesome.  

Must stop here if you are in old Montreal."}
{"text":"Delicious cake !Fantastic! Vey good experience, I will be back. Btw: I like ice wine which recommend by waiter."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it is because I came here an hour before they close, or their service is just terrible all the time. The guy did not bother explaining any of their desserts (even after I asked what each one was), as they seem to be more concerned with closing the place on time than selling the rest of their desserts. 

We chose one of the pistachio cakes and a mango gelato from the fridge. I have no idea what was in the pistachio cake since the guy didn't bother to tell me at all... if that wasn't bad enough, they didn't have any plastic knifes or folks. It took asking 3 different staff members and 5 good minutes of waiting around for them to get a couple of folks. 

** oh and there are seating areas but apparently they won't let you sit there an hour before they close since they close that area first. 

As for the actual desserts, they were alright. The cake was mediocre at best and the gelato was way too sweet. Maybe I didn't try the right desserts, but will not be returning."}
{"text":"the pastries are soooooo good. The place is quaint but bustling, and is packed with families, couples, and solos. If you're in the area you must grab a pastry!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.  The decor is adorable, food is fantastic, and the pastries are the best in the city.  We had lunch there and really enjoyed the menu selections, we chose the club and lobster/crab sandwich.  Of course we had 3 pastries and cappuccinos after :)"}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to have a friend recommend this place. Stopped in for pastries on our final morning in Montrealy, and it was wonderful. A fresh croissant for me, a chocolate croissant for my wife, and a box of macarons (our first ever). What a great way to end our brief vacation."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! There has never been a better place to sit and eat true French viennoiserie!  The almond croissant is phenomenal and the chocolatine devine!  

A real find in the heart if Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries! Went here on a Sunday and had their brunch special along with some desserts. Eggs Benedict was well cooked and the French toast was delicious even without the syrup.
Definitely try their eclairs. Very well done."}
{"text":"When we went the selection didn't include my favourite Mont Blanc which was disappointing. I was hoping to buy a few cakes to take back to the hotel, but for some reason they were low on variety. I got a Framboisette (cherry chocolate mousse in English) since it was our last day in Montreal before leaving for Quebec City. I advise calling ahead to see if they have what you want before visiting."}
{"text":"The wife wanted some dessert after dinner and we found Maison beside the restaurant we were at. We walked in and no hello or greeting so we decided we would get take out. This was after dinner so there was not much selection left so we settled with a lemon tart and something.... to be honest the gentleman was a bit rude and I felt like getting rushed out. So we ordered two dessert and peace out! again no goodbye or thank you. We got back to our Airbnb and made lemon tea to go with dessert. We tried the lemon tart and it was perfect! not too sweet and not too sour but i do wish there was more of a lemon taste. Tried the second dessert, to be honest I have no idea what it was, but it did not WOW me at all... very boring.... but it went well with the tea :) 

Would come back to see their full selections, but so far it was just okay. Service made my star rating to be a 2 instead of a 3. A smile goes a long way =D"}
{"text":"Service is pretty bad and eclair or croissant were not good at all. Very much overrated. We had to ask for silverware and water twice. It wasn't very crowded either. Nothing we had was close to average including the brunch plank. Only above average item was the French toast."}
{"text":"Macarons are delish - chewy with just the right amount of delicious filling!  Sugared brioche so soft and just the right amount of sweet. Madelines near perfect. Latte and espresso were also on point. 

Fave was the creme caramel which was more a deep salted caramel and had cake and hazelnuts for texture!

The seating is super cute with a fireplace for some romance and is prob nice on a wintry day. 

Come early for the croissants bc we didn't get one either of the two times we came and have to go back!"}
{"text":"Cakes are a bit pricey here but definitely worth to try. We often compliment good desserts by saying they are not too sweet. This is exaclty the compliment i got from everyone when I brought the cake. It doesn't taste too heavy althought there are probably a lot of sugars and butter."}
{"text":"Vraiment agréable et beau les pâtisseries sont comme des bijoux si vous passez par là place royale c'est un must pour les amateurs"}
{"text":"Really liked this pastry boutique tucked away in the heart of old port, they have a great selection of macarons, I especially liked the praline one, as it has a good mix of savory and sweet sensation, the fruity selections are great too, not too sweet but still mouthwatering

The waitress recommended the caneli they have, it is very nicely made, even my parents who do not like sweets that much are very much delighted by the taste and texture of it

The chestnut cake is very tasty, the bottom is made with raspberry jam, and the chestnut part is very light and tasty"}
{"text":"Best almond croissant you will have in beautiful montreal. The decor is beautiful and minimalist. Their server is very polite and they have a great selection of patisseries francaises. Definitely a 5*"}
{"text":"This place is great!! I don't know why there isn't a long line out the door!!! Beautiful building, gorgeous desserts, amazing brunch, friendly staff, and great drinks!"}
{"text":"Delicious and the staff was so friendly! Great place to get a cafe and something sweet after a long day of discovering the city!"}
{"text":"We had an event here, the place has a shop on the ground level, a school on 2 and 3, finally floor 4 is used for events. The event space is not what I'd call \"nice\", and the service was quite slow. The coffee wasn't very good for the event. The French pastries however were absolutely amazing, probably the best I have had outside of France."}
{"text":"So much fun to try all their pastries.  I would go there for treats daily if I lived in the area.  The hot chocolate is so rich.  Fabulous."}
{"text":"Found this gem around the corner from our hotel.  Cafe americano was wonderful--helped by use of real cream.  Almond croissant was delicious."}
{"text":"I tried the flan and strawberry shortcake.  Both were phenomenal and beautifully constructed."}
{"text":"Desserts here are pretty but pricey. Drinks are average. We tried a couple different cakes and croissants. I recommend their egg cake (light and satisfying) and almond croissant (super tasty)."}
{"text":"The moment I set foot in their restaurant area, the waitress told me upfront \"it's too late to eat-in, only take out\" without even saying \"hi\" or \"welcome\". The cannelés don't feature visible pricing. The main manager eavesdrops on your conversation with the waitress. But worst of all, the pastries look like they've been prepared days ago by dozens of different people (bland presentation, no consistency in look).

This tourist trap doesn't even come close to deserve its \"Maison\" monicker"}
{"text":"Attentive service and delicious food in trendy and fun cafe atmosphere. I had quinoa salad with chicken and vegetable soup. Boyfriend had lobster pastry. We shared a Mille feuille for dessert. I like to think of myself as pastry connoisseur and it wasn't the same as a Parisian Mille feuille but still delicious (pastry sheets were a bit thicker here). Definitely a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"It is the best backery I've ever been! 
It has a great location in Old Montreal. Elegant French interior and friendly service. 
I got Eggs Benedict with salmon. it is he food of Kings, so tender and light with foam of bitten egg whites. .. omg. Almond croissant was undeliverable too. Very nice place for all ages."}
{"text":"Located just across from the Pointe-à-Callière Museum, it's a convenient spot to rest your feet or warm up during the winter while exploring Old Montreal. The pastries aren't too bad either.

The main upper level is the cafe while the pastry school is on the lower level. As you enter, you'll be greeted walls of colorful tea tins and macaron models next to a large counter. The dining space is bright and clean, with minimalist furniture (wooden tables with metal tops, transparent plastic chairs) against a mosaic wall of slate-colored stones.

We ordered the mille feuille (LOVED the cream), passion fruit tart with raspberries, apple galette, and something with nutella -- all were absolutely lovely! The illy coffees were nothing special, but good enough to pair with our desserts and help regain warmth in our fingers.

Overall, it's a solid spot with decent pastries and passable coffee, and you won't regret stopping here! Heard they also serve brunch as well!

Notes:
- Credit cards are accepted!"}
{"text":"Magnificent!  A true treat.  The salad was light and refreshing.  The potato salad was perfectly dressed and accented with fresh dill.  The smoked salmon was lightly topped with a gently seasoned creme fraiche.  The pastry tray looked so perfect a decision was difficult.  And the house made lemonade was heavenly.  

Lodged in a lovely old building in the heart of Old Montreal, the restaurant is on the main level with a bakery in the basement.  Floors 2 & 3 are a fabulous pastry school with a meeting room on the top floor.  Well designed me elegantly used.

Make the opportunity to visit this special place!"}
{"text":"Great chocolate and butter croissant. Coffee's good. Space is open and bright. Staff is friendly. Absolutely worth your time and money."}
{"text":"I would like to take a visit again and also recommend all of my friends! The desserts just awesome! Everything is great."}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it! This place was so good we came back the next day. First day we ordered chocolate raspberry cake, chocolate praline cake, chocolate macaron and vanilla macaron. The chocolate raspberry cake was delicious (very raspberry forward) and rich. The praline cake was good as well. Chocolate macarons were to die for!!! Came back the next day and got more! Vanilla was not great. Also got berry eclair the next day which was perfectly light and delicious!"}
{"text":"Cute place by the river! Pretty deserts.
We ordered two coffees and a lemon tarte.
The coffe was excellent the the tarte was to die for. Gave it a four stars because the waitress tried to overcharge me. That was an 8.50 tart. ... place was very expensive."}
{"text":"Best Lemon meringue of my life, quiche is divine. This is the best desert place I have experienced, PERIOD!"}
{"text":"Had the St Honoré which the feuilleté was flaky and fabulous plus the choux was crummy and just right. Yummy"}
{"text":"We were told this was the best pastry shop in Montreal.  It is!  Maybe even beyond!  What a fantastic selection of pastries and light faire.  We tried the chocolate almond croissant, a plain croissant, a maple pastry (cant remember the name), a ham and cheese quiche and salad.  

The pastries were wonderful.  The chocolate almond croissant was very crunchy and flaky and the filling was delicate and lightly sweet.  The other two pastries were just as good.  The quiche was incredible - light and fluffy and soooo delicate.   

We did not get a chance to try any of the dessert pastries but they looked amazing.  We have no doubt that they were.

The staff was friendly and accommodating and we even had the honor to meet Chef Faure who was eating his lunch while we were there.  We stopped by his table to say hello and he was very gracious.  On a scale of 1-10, our experience was a 20!

Don't miss the opportunity to try this gen if a place."}
{"text":"When you think of a croissant- do you think of a soft moon-shaped airy breaded piece of fluff? Well throw that idea out the window.  This place makes a REAL croissant..and The best almond croissant you will ever taste in this vicinity- pricey (around $8? But huge, & it tasted like what seemed to be a hundred layers of butter/almond sweet flakiness falling apart in my mouth)- don't miss this culinary experience!  And get an extra one and mail it to me."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype.. my girlfriend and I went twice while on our vacation to Montreal. The almond pastry was one of the best I have ever had. We had an almond eclair and macrons. My girlfriend didn't really like the eclair but I thought it was great."}
{"text":"Amazing! Beautiful. Cannot wait to get up to Montreal again and this place is definitely on my re-visit list!"}
{"text":"Best pastries I've ever had in my life. The 5 stars are for the pastries only. I did not have other items on the menu. Seating is limited, but worth the homemade jam serve with Madelines."}
{"text":"Go for the sweet treats! Salad include okay, but lemon macaron was delicious and whatever the chocolate decadence my friend had was indeed decadent. Small, a little cramped, but a lot of yum."}
{"text":"They are inconsistent here and overpriced for the lack of quality.

I bought an eclair the first time around and it was good.  I went back for another eclair and it was OLD. It was small, there was practically no cream inside, it was dry.. really, seriously a waste of $6.

If you want a decent eclair that doesn't look too fancy, go to Complexe Desjardins, find the O Gateries / La Belge Bakery there, and buy those eclairs for $4.05 They're worth it.

Only the tarts are decent, but DO NOT take the lemon meringue tart. I paid a lot of money for it and it ended up being totally, utterly, disgusting. I am not a fan of cream to begin with, but then the lemon curd inside was.. just.. effing weird. Like eating dish soap. Sweet dish soap.

I tossed it in the garbage. Took a few bites, regretted the money I spent and .. oof, into the garbage.

I also tried the strawberry cake (fraisier) and found it OK, but the cream on top ruined it for me. The cake was also soaked in sugary syrup and in general was too sweet for my personal tastes but not bad."}
{"text":"wonderful little place to get a pastry and some great coffee, the almond pastry was wonderful and what i had on both visits, also coffee if great but they can get a little confused with my iced coffee orders"}
{"text":"Desserts here were delicious! Very sweet but paired wonderfully with coffee. There's the option to sit in the cafe and enjoy their sweet or savory foods, but one can also buy their pastries to bring home and enjoy later. The cafe is also a pastry school and you can see the chefs at work downstairs while the whole building smells of baked goods. Would definitely like to come back here!"}
{"text":"Based on taste alone -did take out, so no input on service. I wish I had pictures of these delectable, colourful, flavour bombs! Alas, they got devoured way too quickly. I'm not going to lie: it IS pricey. But so worth it. Oh by the way, it is cheaper to take out than to stay in (a pastry will be $6.75 plus tax for take out and $8.50 plus tax ... and tip for stay in). I think you can't go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"This is definitely of one the best patisseries in the city, which perhaps then makes it one of the best patisseries in North America! Everything that is produced here is both exquisitely beautiful and mouthwateringly tasty.

Christian Faure is no ordinary pastry chef he is a MOF (Meilleur Ouvrier de France) which means that he has studied and been tested at the highest levels in the world for his pastry making abilities. I can't even begin to describe in a manner that would do it justice what it takes to earn the title of a MOF. Luckily, there is a terrific documentary on Netflix called Kings of Pastry which does a great job. after watching this film you will have an even greater level of appreciation of what goes into the pastries from Maison Christian Faure. We are lucky to have access to such wonderful works of art for our tummies."}
{"text":"Excellent pain au chocolat. I wish we had stayed and done brunch. The whole case looked amazing. The hot chocolate was not great and the espresso was just ok. I would definitely come back here for food, would probably go for the tea options instead of the other drinks."}
{"text":"This is a great Montreal experience to have. They will bring a tray full of pastries to choose from. We tried the passion fruit tart and the hazlenut eclairs. The tart was fresh and flavorful however the eclair was comoletely off. There was too much praline on it and the pastry was a bit soggy. Maybe they had an off day with the eclair as my previous visit was much more delightful!"}
{"text":"You walk in to an overload of amazing looking pastries. How does one decide what they want to eat! All look delish! We sat for the breakfast eggs Benedict that came with smoked salmon, brioche and caramel sauce and great fruit. All amazing. We also had the lobster and crab salad on brioche and it was finger licking good! Great ambiance and nice servers. All happy and helpful!"}
{"text":"Right in Old Montreal, this world class patisserie sits.  Everything is good here, impeccably done and impeccably presented. Croissants, cakes small and large, coffee. Very nice staff. Reasonably priced. If you are wandering through Old Montreal and want a quick treat you must stop here. The place does a booming takeout business with the locals, who know from patisserie.  A few tables inside. Go."}
{"text":"Visited Montreal for Osheaga and wanted to go for a nice brunch before the festival. This place was highly rated on Yelp and TripAdvisor, so had to give it try. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated which is average for a brunch place in Old Montreal. We ordered the brunch special which came with a beverage (tea or espresso-based). The meals were to die for. The brioche and the caramel sauce were the best part of the meal. The pineapple with mint and the ham on the puffed pastry with the cream sauce were both a close second. I have no doubt that Christian and his apprentices can bake delectable pastries, however one suggestion is to improve the service. The servers were very professional, however due to a lack of staff, we waited awhile to get our coffees and water refilled. All in all, a very good experience and would visit again when I am in old Montreal."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab pastries and coffee after some museums. The seating is a bit confusing- the place was packed, and we hovered around a bit by the counter at the entrance to the seating area without being acknowledged, then saw an opening and made a beeline for the table, only to be stopped by waitstaff informing us to go back and they'd seat us. While we were sitting, saw the same thing happen to multiple other parties- they either need sign or more attentive staff. The coffee was good and rich, though no one offered milk and we didn't see our server again for a long while after it was delivered. Pastries were phenomenal- they actually bring you a tray of everything they have available to your table, so you can pick from there, which is great. Would definitely recommend for pastries and cute ambiance, just be patient re: service."}
{"text":"This was near my hotel and was drawn to it simply by walking by the doorway one morning.
I went every morning for 4 straight days and by the second day they knew the kind of tea I drank and how I liked it. 
You walk in and the smell is amazing.
However that is nothing to the food and pastry.
It's not cheap, but you get 10 times in flavor what you pay for.
On my last day I loaded up on the jams and goodies to bring home as gifts and ended up keeping most of what I purchased. 
My first day home, I woke up and missed my window seat table at Maison Christian Faure, my Earl Gray tea and just about everything else about the place.

Find time to visit this wonderful experience in sweet, smell, taste and comfort."}
{"text":"Maison Christian Faure is a fancy patisserie in the heart of the Old Port. They boast gorgeous desserts that to me are a huge hit or miss flavor wise. Their prices are also pretty insane. Would come back any day for their passion fruit-raspberry tart but otherwise, this place is not for me. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Orgasmic to say the least. A MUST when going to MTL :) Such a beautiful shop tucked within old Montréal. The staff is very pleasant and the pastries are to die for! I'm a coffee guy (super strong espresso actually) but the coffee was way too strong for me. While that would normally take a star away, the amazing pastries made up for it. 5 stars, and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is on my top list of macarons! 
It was amazing and the coffee cake was the perfect balance. 
The employees were sweet and spoke English as well!
It's a must see place if you visit Montreal"}
{"text":"Easy to get to from Stop 2 on the Hop On Hop Off bus. 
This has become our favorite pastry shop in Montreal.  A daily visit at least. 
Lunch available but the pastries are irresistible!  
Only Canneles outside France and divine Almond croissants!"}
{"text":"On our last morning in Montreal, we were directed to this fantastic bakery.
The space is beautiful; the food is fantastic; and the service is...friendly enough. If they lacked in any category at all, I'd say we didn't feel exceptionally welcome. Maybe that was because we came after the morning rush, and were sort of asking to be an afterthought.
The royal breakfast was very tasty, though I think we'd been hoping for them to have something a bit more fortifying. If you're looking for sweet, though, this is it.
I have to say, I was a bit rude. Though I'm usually more conscious of such things,  I murmured to my wife on the way out that $7 (USD) for a small bag of marshmallows seemed a bit much. I should have waited 10 more seconds until we were outside. Apparently, one of the staff overheard me, and (probably a bit offended) reminded us that they were homemade. I wasn't talking to you, but, you're right. They are homemade. And they were delicious. They barely made it back to Boston. Touche."}
{"text":"What a great experience we had at Maison Christian Faure. We visited this place for our Saturday Brunch. We were seated very quickly despite the lineup (with two young little boys it's always a plus plus). One of my sons ordered macarons and fresh orange juice, and the other one ordered croissants and chocolate croissants (w/ fresh orange juice as well). I ordered their brunch plateau which was diversified and delicious (I will add very affordable compared to other places I've recently visited - app. 20$) as well as a hot chocolate. Service was very quick and our waitress was very attentive and nice. I would recommend this place for the overall experience, the service, the atmosphere and of course the food."}
{"text":"The best pastries I've ever had in my life. They bring out a full tray of perfectly sized pastries from which you can choose from, ranging from fruity to chocolatey. The environment is very small but beautiful. There is a colorful classic mural on the entrance, the service is impeccable, and the taste of the pastries are complex. The tea, coffee, and the iced tea are amazing as well, served in illy ceramic cups and detailed glasses respectively. Great experience."}
{"text":"Do not miss this gem and make sure you go early in your trip so you can return again and again! This is a classic French bakery with much to delight the senses.  The staff is more than happy to help you make a selection, either to go or to enjoy it he shop.  Get a nice cuppa and settle in to rest your tired toes and delight your senses.  I could make suggestions, but offerings change daily, and having been here repeatedly, I can confidently say that no. Matter what you choose, you will not be disappointed, in fact, you will be delighted.  And get some to go, you will be dreaming about their goods before you get home."}
{"text":"Terrific pastry shop.  It is run by a world class pastry chef who also has a pastry school located in the same building as the restaurant.  The service can be spotty as they are typically very busy, hence the 4 star rating.  The pastries are top notch though so I'll keep coming back every time I visit Montreal!! We sampled the almond and chocolate croissants and they were great."}
{"text":"My sweet tooth thanks you Mr. Faure! I went there once with my girlfriend and a friend and we had a selection pastries that were amazingly good! What we loved is the mix between classics like lemon pie and originals like a green sponge cake with some cream on top (sorry I don't really remember). However, what I do remember is that I'll go back there as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Stop whatever you are doing and come to this place right now. The food, the ambiance, the service was everything and more. Our food was not only delicious, but it's presentation was out of this world. Our waiter was the sweetest thing, always making sure we had everything we needed. We asked to meet with the chef and boy was he one of my favorite humans. He was selfless and humble about the work he does and even introduced us to the marketing director who took us on a tour of the small but ever so delightful school upstairs. I love them and we plan are going back for brunch. GO HERE NOW!"}
{"text":"This is a quiet little cafe with amazing coffee and pastries. The staff was extremely nice and the prices were reasonable. My husband and I had an Americano and a chocolate croissant........delicious."}
{"text":"The waitstaff are very helpful. The coffee selection is minimal with a decent choice of French pastries, but not as many as a typical corner bakery in France. $9 for small coffee (expresso), juice, small pastry, and a piece of sweet bread....which is about par for the area."}
{"text":"Great little place to grab a croissant. Make sure to get there early or you will wait for service or a seat. Pastries are unbelievably appealing both visually as well as their taste. I ordered the Royal and my wife the chocolate croissant, both were just what we were looking for. This place has a lot to offer from the well put together decor, beautiful and tasty food and illy coffee products. We would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I am conflicted about the rating of this review because the desserts and baked goods were delicious, but the service was just so deplorable that it ruined our experience here. And let me tell you that I was very much looking forward to the day that I would be in a patisserie of a MOF (Meilleur Ouvrier de France). 

Quiet day in Old Montreal and this place was one of the few open shops when we came. 
Sneak a peek downstairs and you can see croissants proofing. The entrance just smells wonderful. The displays are perfect and organized. All staff are bilingual. You can choose a table to sit at, and the staff comes with a tray of pastries and desserts with a description of each. This seemed like a nice service...however after placing our order, we requested water as our drink and the female staff rolled her eyes! While waiting for our order, a male staff comes with the same tray and asked what we wanted. I clearly said, \"We already ordered.\" and he proceeds to question what I want and I was quite confused at this point. He wasn't nice about it either and kept pressing. Then the female staff notices what is happening and tells her co-worker in French that we have already ordered. 

Desserts are fairly priced and what you would typically expect for a higher end bakery/patisserie. Croissants were crispy on the outside, soft and had a nice distribultion of air bubbles on the inside. Flan was very smooth and not too sweet or eggy. The eclair Paris-Brest was absolutely amazing. The hazelnut cream, with the hazelnuts and choux pastry was heavenly. Treat yourself! The pastries get 6 stars. 

All in all, terrible service for such a nice establishment in a touristic area and it wasn't even busy that day. Such a shame because the pastries are amazing."}
{"text":"If there was a way to bottle sumptuous and opulent French patisserie, a down-to-earth and unpretentious cafe with a Parisian-like atmosphere, and a pastry-cooking school for the amateurs to the more serious, then Maison Christian Faure has made this dream possible in the elegant multi-floor temple of wordly treats located right in the historical heart of old Montreal.

My pilgrimage started on a lazy Saturday morning with a frothy cafe au lait with the difficult task of choosing between the different types of exquisite viennoiseries including buttery croissants, different types of jams, dozens of fancy brioches, golden mini-madeleines, pain au chocolats and so many more. Thank goodness the lovely host, Chloé, was there to help me.

The journey then continued with a (take out) sampling of perfectly executed pralined Paris Brest Eclairs (my favorite), decadent Milles-Feuilles, a classic Opera, and the colorful Raspberry and Passion Fruit Tartelette. There were so many other more to chose from but I had to show some restraint as quality does come with a price... no worries, I will certainly return with friends!

In a culture where it is getting tougher to find the time to pause, take a seat, to  reconnect with each and other -- children, parents, friends, neighbors and ultimately ourselves, I strongly recommend you to take a break and treat yourself. This seems to just that perfect chic place for conversation, and escape from daily routines -
you'll feel both fanciful and folksy all at the same time."}
{"text":"This place serves delicious food! The almond croissant is to die for! I also had the eggs benedict brunch option which was great! The wait staff is friendly and speedy. I highly recommend this place! It is close to old town and the river which is also nice."}
{"text":"Overpriced pastry and drinks. We had 2 hot chocolates and 1 rasberry and passion fruit tart and it cost a total of 22$...2 small drinks and 1 small pastry...The tart is delicious although the crust was a bit too hard. The hot chocolate was just a normal hot chocolate with foam. It came in a cheap mug with no presentation at all, no art with the milk or anything. 

The place itself is clean and it's a nice place to sit down and talk with friends. However, considering the price, I would definitely not come back."}
{"text":"Fraîchement inaugurée en août dernier, la Maison Christian Faure ouvre ses portes dans le plus grand respect de la tradition française, sur la Place Royale dans le Vieux-Port de Montréal.

Répartie sur les 5 étages de la bâtisse historique, on retrouve tout d'abord au sous-sol l'atelier de production qui sent bon l'amour (et le beurre!), au rez-de-chaussé le comptoir-boutique. Les autres étages sont réservés à l'école de pâtisserie, comprenant une salle de cours et des îlots de travail individuels, pour amateurs sérieux et professionnels.

J'y déjeune avec des petits oeufs bénédictines servis dans un chou : un au jambon, l'autre au saumon fumé. La sauce hollandaise revisitée qui nappe le plat m'oblige à y tremper mon doigt - un régal! Le pain perdu avec sa sauce au caramel est également bien fait, mais je suis plus une bibitte à sel qu'à sucre, surtout le matin. Malgré tout, les pâtisseries que je déguste par la suite sont succulentes, que ce soit l'éclair aux fraises, la tarte aux pacanes ou encore la petite tarte au citron.

J'ai aussi pu goûter au soufflé au chocolat, qui sera au menu dès cet automne : un petit goût de paradis chaud et sucré :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe with amazing pastries and coffee. It can be crowded but worth the wait. Or better yet, go early"}
{"text":"We got brunch plank and Americanos at this cafe and with my sweet tooth, I had to buy some macarons for the drive back. Everything tasted great and service was superb. There's a pasty/cooking school upstairs so you know the food was made on-site. Recommend this while you're in old montreal."}
{"text":"soooooooo good. I tried several different ones, tarts, eclairs. They are all delicate."}
{"text":"A nice place to sit for an extended afternoon pastry break...a wide variety of well executed French pastry, and a nice selections of wine by the glass as well. I would give it a higher rating, but went on a moday and some of the pastry were a little old. In addition, the service was quite poor, but perhaps because they were understaffed? I will say that I enjoyed the ambiance, and have a sneaking suspicion that this is a excellent place to have a full brunch experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place . It looked almost closed
They have a pastry school upstairs 
YOU WILL LOVE IT"}
{"text":"One of the best desert places. I had a chocolate cake dessert. It had a heavenly taste. It seems like it was so carefully crafted. I almost closed my eyes while having the cake because it was that good. The coffee though is nothing special."}
{"text":"Delicious, awesome service.  We had the peach caramel tart and it was superb.  Anything you try from there should be amazing.  They also put them in the coolest little boxes.  :)"}
{"text":"Quaint bakery/restaurant in Old Montreal. My wife and I shared the Club sandwich, and it was good. My wife had a chocolate croissant, and I had the Brioche topped with crystallized sugar with a side of jam. You could see the Chef (Faure) teaching one of the students in the back and helping prepare some of the items being sent out. Their desserts look spectacular and so meticulously well prepared."}
{"text":"didn't like the madelein, canele was just comme si comme ca"}
{"text":"Fanciful pastry shoppe: 
-ghost chairs strewn throughout
-gorgeous sugar display pieces
-illy coffee 
-packaged marshmallows and sweets 
-gelato in the case
-the flakiest, lightest croissant ever, must order!!!

Brunch specials in the AM.  Limited savory menu starts at 11am.  If you like almond croissants, get there early, they were sold out at 10am today.  

Tidbits: skip the Madeline.  Dry.  Bathrooms on the 4th floor.  The maple pastry is the second least sweet pastry next to the plain croissant."}
{"text":"BRILLIANT BRILLIANT AND BRILLIANT . Love the service and the product.  They were busy but attentive to our needs. Our server ( sorry forgot her name ) was awesome.  Not only she was patient, knowledgable but kind.  My elder uncle and 2 kids wanted to go back to hotel after a long day   She volunteered to guide them to the metro as she was getting off her shift.  I truly want to thank her and wish her all the luck in this new town as she moved from some Caribbean island recently ."}
{"text":"makes me feel like a lady when I walk in here. pricey but when you're here it makes you feel like you can swipe (with a credit card) and not think about budgeting. 

recommended by the pastry chefs themselves: passion fruit tart & chocolate eclair
loved their caneles"}
{"text":"If you want traditional French pastries this place is as good as it gets. We went to Maison Christian Faure for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The atmosphere was pleasant and the service very professional. The almond croissant was as good as any pastry I've ever had. Soft almond paste center, crispy, flaky crust outside. Coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice rounded out the meal and we left satisfied and wishing we didn't have to leave Montreal."}
{"text":"Breakfast was okay... Not worth the hype. The service was pretty horrible as they forgot about us completely. Waited like almost 10 mins before they finally took our order... Forgot our forks/napkin... and water.... 

Pretty disappointed.
It was half busy at first.. But still- not worth it for breakfast or even coffee if you have to wait around for everything"}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing buttery pastries and delicious coffees. Almond chocolate croissant - incredibly rich and tasty. This is high praise in city filled with fantastic bakeries and coffee shops. Definitely recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Maybe it's because we're American but we had no friendly greeting. Felt more like a burden.  No breakfast menu.  The waitress had to tell us the types of bread they had and added whatever else was in the glass case we could order and looked at us expecting like we memorized the menu.  The other waitress at least showed other guests a platter of desserts of what they served but ours snubbed at us.  We had to practically beg for our utensils that we're just at arms length from us.  I had a croissant with ham and cheese and the inside was super cold.  The only thing good was the hot chocolate.  All I can say is that breakfast is the worst and this is a tourist trap!! We paid a fancy price for subpar food and the worst service ever.  Our waitlist name according to the receipt says frederic, so advise, don't get stuck with her. Still confused as to why we even tipped her, since she didn't do anything but pass us by as she catered to non-Americans.  My mother inlaw had to drink her coffee black since they refused to give her cream/milk as she asked them twice with no avail.  Don't go here if you're American, they snub at you!!"}
{"text":"Was recommended here by a friend from Montreal, and it sure didn't disappoint! Never thought French toast could taste so good :'). Every pastry on display looked appetizing here, and they probably were. We tried the blackberry one, and it delicious and not overly sweet.
We came here for their brunch. It was $22 which included a hot drink and a croissant of your choice, egg Benedict with ham or smoked salmon, a fruit cup and a French toast. Have to say that this was probably one of the best brunch places I've been to. Each item on the brunch tray had a unique taste and texture, and didn't just all conglomerate into one mushy brunch plate. Would definitely recommend. 
My only regret was not buying a few of their macarons, but for the next time!"}
{"text":"Dont really understand how this shop got a 4.5 star rating and #1 dessert in Montreal. Pastry was a meh. Service was pretty bad."}
{"text":"This is rated very high on French patisseries in Montreal . We definitely wanted to eat at a Patisserie in Old Montreal . We went almost at their closing time and they were nice to us . We had their Eclairs dessert which was great . Their hot chocolate was delicious . One of the best hot chocolates I have had till today."}
{"text":"The chocolate almond crossaint and the mango passion macarons are must haves! My friend had been dying to take me to this place, and I was skeptical at first. How good can a croissant be? Man was I in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. The tarts are amazing. Got the passion fruit tart and mango lemon tart.

Got the chocolate tart and chocolate something. Too rich for me. But still amazing subtle taste.

Ambiance was lovely and cute French pastry shop style inside.

Service was fast, attentive, and friendly.

Overall, would come back again for the tarts if I lived in Montreal. Would come every month or every other week if I exercise."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with a french dessert shop and I was not disappointed. The mango tart and chocolate croissant were both very good. We accidentally prepaid for our food and wanted to sit down instead. The staff seated us and gave us forks, and then proceeded to ignore us as if we were not going to tip them since we prepaid. It was a little obnoxious and that is the reason for the slightly lower rating. 4 stars for the desserts, 2 for the service"}
{"text":"My family and I came here on our last morning in Montreal and I am so glad we did. The cafe is incredibly adorable inside; very bright and welcoming. They serve incredible pastries for the morning: croissants, chocolate croissants, croissants with chocolate on the outside, almond croissants, along with an array of others. Each one was better than the next, and believe I know because we had to try them all! The coffee was quite good as well. My husband ordered hot chocolate and it was some of the best i've ever had. It was rich in flavor, creamy, thick, and delicious. I absolutely loved this place. They had an array of delectable looking desserts as well. I wish I had found it earlier in the trip so we could have gotten some of those too!"}
{"text":"This was the highlight of our trip!!! For the 3 days we were here, we came here everyday. The lunch is good selection of sandwiches, salads and hot entrees and they were all nicely portioned. Not too small and not too large to weigh you down. My daughter had the chicken in puff pastry and I had the pate en croute. Both came with salads and were delicious. The service was wonderful and the pastries were AMAZING!!! The iced tea was flavored and already sweetened. The iced cappuccino was perfect on a hot day. The location is great for people watching. If you are in the area, you MUST come!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much agree with the consensus. We ordered an almond croissant and a couple of quiches. The croissant was excellent and the quiches were good. They bring you a foie gras appetizer/bite, which is not to be confused for your actual order. A little slow on service at times but was overall a great place to stop for a bite during our explorations of Old Montreal."}
{"text":"A delightful gem in vieux port with delicious pastries, cakes, and chocolates--worth a visit!

I came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday evening, because she was craving one their chocolate almond croissants. We arrived around 6pm, and although the café was closed, they were still open to take to-go orders. 

It's a small place, and the lighting was a little bit dim, but not in a bad way. All of their remaining croissants were piled on a little table to the side, while their cakes were illuminated under a covered display. 

They didn't have any chocolate almond croissants left, so we got a raspberry chocolate mousse cake. It was delicious and BEAUTIFUL. See the photos attached to my review ;) 

I will definitely return to try their croissants!"}
{"text":"Pastries are expensive here and the taste is average. I ordered a croissant which was very flaky and delicious. I also orders the Mille Feuille which was below average. In general, it's acceptable but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Just outstanding. We tried two desserts (raspberry and chocolate dessert and a coffee eclair). Took 4 macaroons to go. Great little spot. If you're nearby, don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here when visiting Montreal for a mid- day snack before heading home.

We came the night before at around 6pm but the dining area was already closed for the night (the dining area closes one hour before the store closes)

We opted for a pastry tray of desserts ($8.50) this is where they bring you the whole tray to pick from. It was def hard to choose as they all looked tasty.

I opted for a mango tart that was filled with white chocolate and creme brule. The tart was to die for! The tart was nice and light (not too buttery) and blended together with the soft fluffy mango chocolate creme brule cake on top. There was also some bits of chocolate crunch on the side to give the cake more texture. 

I also purchased some croissants to-go. Which were delicious as well. My favs were def the chocolate croissant ($3.20) and the almond chocolate croissant ($3.20). The plain butter ones ($3) were good as well. 

The place is suuper cute and a great place for a mid-day treat in the area!"}
{"text":"There's not much I can say that hasn't been said here already.  Found this place through Yelp and visited.  Was everything that I hoped for.   I've been a few times now and when I go to Montreal, I try to return.  If there's one thing I think that would improve this place, it would be the service.  It seems a bit unorganized and occasionally somewhat slow, but the pastry is worth any downside on service."}
{"text":"We came here as a tourist family but beware of you are with kids because this is not a place for kids.  This rating is not for the establishment itself (which I am sure has great offerings) it is the patrons here that raises their eyebrows when they see us coming in with kids.  So I guess we will check the place out when we don't have kids with us but if you have kids get take outs and don't stay."}
{"text":"Checked this out based on a recommendation from a friend, was not disappointed. Cappuccino was great but the croissants are amazing. Try both the regular (butter) croissant but also the chocolate covered croissant (not pain au chocolat but actual croissant with chocolate on the inside and outside)."}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation.  Three tables occupied, no line at the counter, two servers.  We waited at the counter for service.  And waited...  One server asked if we wanted something to go, then disappeared.  Second server couldn't be bothered.  No 'bonjour', no 'hello'.  And we waited some more.  We left..."}
{"text":"I will admit that all I had here was a lemonade because I'm vegan and none of their desserts were (understandably! not complaining about their lack of vegan options... I was just there with a friend who wanted to go)... 

but in terms of variety, there didn't seem to be much. the nonvegan inside of me wasn't even really craving anything. 

then again, I may be biased because I generally have never had a sweet tooth. My friend loves the homemade marshmallows and I will admit that it's super cool that it's all homemade stuff. I suppose if you've got a sweet tooth, this may be the place for you."}
{"text":"They have great cannelle. Pistachio gelato was great as well. We also tried their eclair with chestnut cream, which was just sweet enough. Will definitely go there agin when in the area."}
{"text":"I just have to say that Yelp in Montreal never lead us wrong.

This bakery was no exception.  It's in a touristy area, with some expensive hotels and restaurants.  I had a three different croissant-like pastries over two days, as well as a few slices of a loaf of bread.  It was all incredible.  I also brought home a bag of home-made marshmallows.  The guy behind the counter said they are the best in Montreal.....after eating 4 in one sitting, he's probably not lying.

They have some tables so you can sit down to enjoy your pastries and coffee."}
{"text":"Simply put, the best. From the first bite to the last it was heaven. We met the chef and he was just lovely."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome, a bit expensive but worth it. Accidentally spent $50 by ordering 2 of every flavor of macaroon haha but well worth it."}
{"text":"Location: Tucked away in the old port, just off St. Paul.

Space: You can tell that great care was taken in the design and decor of this space because it's absolutely stunning. When you walk in, you'll notice a beautiful mural depicting the days of Montreal past. Similarly, there is another mural located inside the shop. Yes, the place is mostly white and may come across as sterile to some, however, all that white is contrasted with beautiful pops of color that peek out from behind the displays... Displays that are filled with lovely, perfectly crafted pastries and sweets that you would be a fool not to try. Not to mention the awesome stone wall (that may or may not be original) and hardwood floors. The space is incredible - I'm thinking they should let me live there. In terms of seating, there are only a handful of tables, but these are well spaced out so you don't need to share your dessert with your neighbors. You all know how I feel about personal space! 

Stuff: You saw my pictures. If you didn't, then go look at them and you'll immediately understand why I fell in love with this place. The Maison C-F offers fresh pastries that are so pretty, you'll feel bad cutting into them with that fancy spork they give you. They also make macarons, cakes, baked goods, and they have a refrigerated section where you can purchase pre-made cakes. I'm not sure if they're ice cream cakes so you can go check that out for yourself.  I ordered an Americano and it was served just the way I like it, using Illy coffee. My dessert of choice was the chocolate eclair. It was positively divine - delectable - deliriously delicious. I have never been served an eclair that was so.... stuffed - and the filling was chocolate! YUM! They're not cheap, that's for sure. The eclair was amazing and I could tell the patissier uses quality ingredients simply by its taste and texture. That said, it WAS a bit rich, which is why I begrudgingly left a little piece behind. I just couldn't eat anymore despite my best efforts. My date had the pot au caramel and loved it. 

Service: This is why I rated this 4 stars instead of 5. No one greeted us when we walked in. We stood at the counter for a minute because we weren't sure if we should be waiting for someone to seat us or if it was OK to pick our own table. Even then, no one greeted us. We then sat at our table for a few minutes while boy-waiters walked by and looked at us, but still offered no greeting. HELLO are you BLIND? For a minute, I thought we'd entered into a new restaurant trend - where the wait staff is both blind mute. When we finally did get service, our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable, so that made up for the initial failure to launch.  BUT you should still greet your clients when they walk through the door.  On a related note, M. Faure was out and about on the floor chitchatting with clients as well as greeting those that walked through the door. We ran into him in the elevator and he was very friendly. It's great to see a business owner taking the time to interact with their clientele - it definitely encourages repeat visits!

So.... you have to go. Get off your couch, brave this crazy-ass Montreal polar vortex and go feast on Christian Faure's pastries. Don't worry - you'll leave there a little plumper so you won't feel the cold as much =-D"}
{"text":"Stopped by here twice -- first during a food tour of the city and snatched up a dozen of their macaroons which were juicer than normal ones I've had. They came in at least a dozen flavors and I got one of each

Came back later for an early dinner and while I was starving their menu was misleading since they only had one menu item to select from. I take a star for that since why do you even offer me a menu then...?

Their dish was a bagel topped with lox and an egg prepared beautifully. On the side was fresh fruit, French toast and a container of salted caramel to dip it in. Also included a bakery item where we picked a chocolate croissant that was perfect baked!"}
{"text":"Nicely located in the heart of old Montréal. 

The bakery is small but feels spacious. Inside the restaurant is beautiful and super neat. 

The pastries that are displaying as you enter the restaurant, are mouth watering. 

The service is formidable. I ordered a hot chocolate and an almond croissant. Both were simply delicious and decadent. I enjoyed every sip of my hot chocolate and every bite of my croissant. 

I really loved this place; I can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"French pastry shops are as abundant in Montreal as cornfield are in Nebraska, that being said, some stand out more than others. While driving around the city looking for a cafe to enjoy some great croissants, we stumbled upon this place by accident, and how glad we were that we did! Although a bit pricy, this place has decedant, fresh baked goods that range from crossaints to chocolate truffles, and their coffee drinks are fabulous! While the seating area is a bit small, there are tables to sit down at if you want to escape the frigid weather (i.e., it was -6 degrees F when I was there). I had a bowl of squash soup with not one, but TWO mochaccinos (cafe mocha), which were honestly the best I've ever had. Lastly, I ended my meal with a chocolate croissant. If you are in Montreal, then this place is an absolute must if you wish to try authentic French pastry."}
{"text":"MY GOODNESS this place is awesome. We arrived at around noon on a Sunday and were happy that we didn't have to wait for a table. Staff were so friendly too.

Got the brunch plate. $20 for choice of drink, choice of danish, eggs benedict on brioche, sweet brioche with caramel and cup of fruit. Also for pastries, got a crunchy hazelnut lemon rectangular thing, and raspberry tart with rose whipped cream. 

Got the cappuccino for drink, the almond slice for danish, and smoked salmon for the eggs benedict. The almond slice danish was so delightful. Flaky and buttery, and not overly sweet. The eggs benedict was well done, I want to try the ham version another time. Loved the sweet brioche french toast with caramel. 

For pastries, I really enjoyed the raspberry tart and was less into the hazelnut lemon one. But that's just personal preference. Everything here was very well executed!! I would certainly come back."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best pastry shops in the city. I personally prefer this location over the one on de maisonneuve, the pastries taste fresher in my opinion. My all time favourite is the passion fruit and raspberry tarte! DELISH !

They also offer pastry cooking courses."}
{"text":"Been here few times and every time I come... AMAZING! came for lunch and brunch with my fiance, my family, and friends... they all loved and want to come again. The dessert is speechless?. It is so pretty I have to stare at it few second before I can destroy? with my mouth. Also, the price is very reasonable. The food tastes great too! Also the service is great! During weekend, wait time is long...."}
{"text":"Cutest little cafe we've stopped at so far. When you enter there's a deloscious aroma of sweet baked goodness and bitter espresso. My boyfriend and I had illy espresso and vanilla macaron. Collation parfaite"}
{"text":"Bummed to have missed lunch hours, but the pastry I had was very good. Staff were a bit harried, but quite nice. And the shop was gorgeous. I'd like to come back for lunch or brunch."}
{"text":"Very elegant and royal pastry shop located in the heart of old Montreal. Every time I'm in the area I have to make a pit stop here! In the mornings, they carry a brunch menu which consists of eggs, a danish, cake and a drink (if I remember correctly?) This time we decided to opt in for their cakes. I tried their strawberry shortcake and it was delish!!! Each layer was filled with their strawberry creme and mounted with full strawberries. The bottom layer of the cake was also a thin crisp of white chocolate. One of my friends ordered their butter crossiant and I have to say.. all the calories in that crossiant is so worth it! Flaky and crispy and buttery... everything you need in an amazing crossiant! They also have a good selection of buttery pastries from butter crossiant to almont crossiant to chocolate crossiant to apple turnover and butterfly cookies. They also carry a wide range of macarons as well but I never had the opportunity to try.

The cool thing about this shop is that they also have a pastry school on the 3rd floor of this unit! If you wanted to host a pastry shop or learn from their executive chef, you can have the opportunity to do so. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the old montreal area!"}
{"text":"I got the almond croissant with a cappuccino first time. Both were excellent. I just wish the takeout coffee was bigger. I also came here a second time and tried their brunch. It was excellent and the price was great! I got coffee, a croissant and french toast with eggs benedict for $18!! Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"We popped in here for lunch on a whim because Olive and Gourmando our first choice was too busy.  It actually worked out better for us because we both enjoyed our desserts. We tried the lobster brioche which was smallish but excellent.  The lobster claw meat was sweet and tender.  Our club sandwich was the weaker of the the two.  It was soggy with way too much mayo and on a thin white barely toasted bread--we barely touched it.  I would pass on the club next time.  Our desserts were the highlight of the meal.  Both were fresh and well prepared.  Service was fine given that they were busy.  A great location for people watching."}
{"text":"Our family stopped by this bustling bakery on a hot August afternoon. We got the most delicious baked goods. The croissant was buttery and flaky. The almond crossoint was filled with soft almond paste. The chocolate croissant possibly the best ever. My cafe latte was smooth and creamy. The best patisserie of our trip!"}
{"text":"Just like Paris. Phenomenal and exquisite pastries for eating in or bringing home. You only live once, right? Tres, tres bien!"}
{"text":"Cute and charming little place. It's on a small side street in Old Montreal. The decor is simple but comfortable and pretty. 

The server Come over with a tray of dessert they have today and explain each one to you. 

I ordered a pistachio tart with raspberry, white chocolate and a hint of rose flavor.  It was delicious, but pricey! ($8.50).  The allonge ($4.25) I got really hit the spot. Great coffee!!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by this place. It has the best pastry I have ever tasted. The chocolate croissants are works of art. This is a must when in Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch in this bakery/ school. 
Cozy cafe, good food and amazing pastries!
I had Salmon Gravlax with puff pastry , it was like nothing I've ever had. Light & flaky puff perfectly season cream cheese salmon with bib salad on side.
Butternut squash cappuccino soup was out of this world!
Will return !"}
{"text":"Great desert! The food was amazing, the hot chocolate was thick and old fashion. The coffee was well prepared and well presented.

Why 4 stars? The place was way understaffed for the number of people. This means longer wait time, longer serve time and waiting forever for the receipt. This also mean that after paying, the staff was so all over the place that one of the waiter came running after us with the receipt because he thought we were leaving without paying. Pretty insulting. Not his fault, that is for sure, but still my experience at the place.

NB: don't do the mistake I made. I was thinking I could eat 2 desserts. Those are pretty heavy..."}
{"text":"Their pastries have delightful texture and are not overly sweet. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Dropped by after brunch for tea and dessert. We ordered 3 desserts (Chocolate Eclair, Mont Blanc , Coup de Soleil) and two cups of Lov tea. The restaurant is very clean and elegant and the presentation of their food is beautiful. However, the price is very steep! The quality of their dessert is a bit above average but not worth the price. The service is just okay. Probably wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"It says the coffee is ILLY. I feel It's not as good as these in ILLY store. For desserts, I like the pot caramel fleur de sel. Taste really good and not that sweet. The tarte passion framboise is too sweet for me and the pastry cup is not crispy enough."}
{"text":"Maison Christian Fauré is an elegant pastry shop - as fancy as you can get in Montreal, anyways. I had wanted to try their creations for a long time, yet never made it to that corner of Old Montreal. We took the opportunity to do so after visiting La Grande Braderie at Marché Bonsecours in October.

It was around lunchtime, and the shop was packed. The decor was modern and the smell of warm pastries was amazing. No tables were available for lunch, so we bought a few items to go. It was a difficult choice: every single item looked beautiful and delicious (I would have gladly tried all of them, to be honest). We settled for a I-forgot-the-name tart, a piece of flan, a croissant and a cannelé. It was pricey, but not surprisingly so. We sat outside to try the pastries. Everything was very refined and well crafted, yet somehow the resulting experience was not as exciting and new as expected. Chef Christian Fauré had promised to revitalize the Montreal pastry scene, but he probably meant the \"haute-couture\" scene, specifically. Outside of that highly technical and select circle are actually many younger, adventurous businesses that are pushing boundaries, albeit in other directions. The pastries at Maison Christian Fauré are certainly world-class, but mostly French in spirit. 

Great shop, great location - overall pleasant despite a rushed service."}
{"text":"Chef Christian Fauré recently opened a second location, this time in downtown Montreal. They took the spot of the former Suite 88 Chocolatier, a spot beloved by sweet tooths around town. I noticed the new location a few days before Christmas, as I was last-minute shopping. I remembered how my boyfriend had been tempted by their homemade maple marshmallows when we visited their Old Port shop, so I went in.

The place was crisp and elegant, with white walls and white counters. Their coloful products were pops of colours that attracted the eye and aroused appetite. They had kept the interior plans of Suite 88, with the long counter and seats beside the door. The shelves by the window displayed many packed products, mostly marshmallows and chocolates. A row of counter seats also lined the window, but no chairs were in sight. The shop offered tea and coffee, as well as macarons and signature pastries (although there wasn't many choices left because it was late in the day). They also had croissants, chocolatines, and some savory options, such as quiche.

Maison Christian Fauré can be quite pricey. My pack of maple marshmallows was around 12$, but it was well worth it, given the enthusiastic cheer it elicited at home. Very strong maple flavors!"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal for the first time. We were tired after a long day of walking, biking. I really wanted to have a dessert. So I took my husband along to this place and am glad we ended up here! We took a couple of pastries. They tasted amazingly yummy. The raspberry mousse was out of the world."}
{"text":"Maison Christian Faure = the absolute best. Everything about this place is spectacular - from the mouth watering desserts, to the friendly servers to the fun dining experience; this place is worth visiting I believe if you're a tourist or not.

We enjoyed it so much we visited twice during a long holiday weekend and my husband even special ordered a unique tarte tatin dessert as a surprise.
Aside from all of the out of this world desserts, the hot chocolate is 100% worthwhile super decadent and delicious.

Do yourself a favor and bookmark this place and go!"}
{"text":"Quick summary: Just go .. Its that good

I was in a mood for some pastry and had happen to stumble into here. It was so good that my wife order two boxes full of dessert for my family. And then on my final day in Montreal we order additional pastries for travel. We are now actively looking for a place comparable to this place in our local area. It is one of those places that makes you realize how some desserts can be delectable and why some people specialize in just making these desserts.  Enough reading and start walking to this place."}
{"text":"La maison Christian Faure est un bijou de la pâtisserie française nichée au vieux port de Montréal. Vous allez y trouver des pâtisseries d'excellente qualités!!! Le croissant aux amandes est le MEILLEUR de tout montreal. Je vous recommande fortement cette endroit. Vous ne regretterez pas! Je n'hésite pas a y retourner des que possible."}
{"text":"Walked in. No one acknowledged us, asked for a table (in English) - lady looked at me and walked away. Got ignored for another 5 minutes, walked out..."}
{"text":"Super touristy (reflective in the price) and jam-packed.
While the pastries are good, I'd rather not endure the disorganized lineup system and lack of AC in the middle of summer. 
Don't get me wrong, if you absolutely crave a good croissant or mille feuille at the Old Port, this is the place to be. But given the crazy level of tourist crowd and jacked up price point, maybe just head somewhere away from Old Port for your sweets.
Beautiful decor, but unfriendly service."}
{"text":"Just an update to add I've since tried their croissants and the Paris Brest cake, both of which were absolutely delicious. So, there are items that justify a wonderful review and some others that miss the mark for me. Bumping up my rating to 4/5."}
{"text":"Holy Mother of Quiches!! This place has the best (lightest, fluffiest, yummiest) quiche I have ever tasted! 

It is deceptive from the street as it looks more like a patisserie, it is worth coming inside and having a seat.They have a full blown brunch menu with salads, quiche and soup du jour. I went with the vegetarian quiche and my husband got the cheese and ham. We both licked the plates! It was so good that we are still talking about it, nearly daily, a whole month out.

Once you've eaten your fill of quiche and salad make sure to ask for their pastry tray where you will see a huge selection of their daily creations. I am a sucker for chocolate croissants, but EVERYTHING looked too good to eat.

This place is a feast for your eyes and your taste buds. Make sure to check them out when you are in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"this Cafe has the best dark chocolate tart that i ever had! Love it definitely. And it located at a quiet narrow street, so parking is gonna be a issue in old Montreal but it's still worth to try it at least."}
{"text":"Certainly posh! It's nice that this place is close to the port. Considering it was freezing cold, I scurried back to my hotel room afterwards.

The man who helped me did such a great job. I only wanted to know about certain pastries, but he pointed all of them out to me. This helped because I was indecisive, and I made up my mind by the end of it. He was very professional and pleasant. Not snooty at all! 

I got a chocolate raspberry cake, which was more like a 5 star black forest cake - but with raspberries. Very delicious. Even though I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cakes, I couldn't help but scarf this down. 

I also got a mango tart. The mousse was delicious. The cross section was gorgeous - between the mango flavours and the mousses and creams. The tart was firm but also not too hard to cut with a fork. 

I came here for the macarons! So I got vanilla as well as caramel. The vanilla one was delicate. The caramel one made me want to eat 10 more. 

Overall, a fantastic experience. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"À vrai dire, les croissants seraient encore meilleurs s'ils étaient plus feuilletés. Est-ce que la recette manque de beurre ?"}
{"text":"A friend once brought me as a date to an arts and culture event, where I mentioned that it was too bad there was no macaroons on the dessert table. The following week, he introduced me to Maison Christian Faure.

Good : The place bright, clean and you can tell that it has quality pastries. They had a variety of macaroon flavors, and lots of delicious viennoiseries and confiseries ! It is a great place to stop for desserts and tea or to catch up with friends or even on a date since it's not to loud inside. And best believe it, the macaroons are amazing and has since raised the bar. It's a interesting mix of cafe and pastry school and shop all in one

Bad : The prices are a bit steep, but what can you expect from a renown pastry chef? 

Bottom Line: I will definitely be returning to this lovely spot if I am in the mood to spoil myself."}
{"text":"Definitely a delicious place to have lunch and pastry :) 

So glad my mom found this place, and it was so close to our hotel! We arrived a little after 12 and were lucky enough to snag a table for two by the window. Our server was a young man who thankfully was bilingual so we didn't have to use much French. Our waiter served us water right away which I was very thankful for because I was parched from the Montreal heat and humidity. However the water or glass had an strange smell to it which was a bit off-putting but I was so thirsty that I drank my entire glass anyway. 

I ordered the beef sandwich and a glass of the passion fruit tea while my mom went with the lobster and crab on choux pastry with a glass of rose lemonade. I enjoyed the sandwich as a whole, especially with the addition of onions, grainy mustard, and cornichons. However there were a few tendons in the most that made biting into the sandwich difficult, and the meat seemed to lack enough seasoning. The side salad was super good though; I really liked the vinaigrette. I also had a taste of the lobster and crab which was light and tasty. My mom said the raspberry sauce on the plate really elevated the seafood flavor which was definitely unexpected! 

Passionfruit tea was excellent but it's definitely sweet so be aware. My mom LOVED the rose lemonade; you can really taste the rose water, but for me it was too tart. 

As for the pastries, we tried the rose cream on pistachio with raspberries, and the chocolate one with raspberry jam. The chocolate one was extremely rich but definitely tasty. It would be difficult to eat alone though because it's super dense and rich. The rose cream one was much lighter and tasted so perfect with the pistachio tart and raspberries. I wasn't a fan of the white chocolate discs but everything else worked together perfectly. 

Just a heads up, the pace here is pretty slow so you have to be assertive if you want the check or need to get your waiter's attention. I asked our server for the check and at least 5 minutes passed with no action on his part. I understood that he had other tables but we ended up having to go to the register in order to close our tab. The lady at the register was super cranky with us that we were trying to pay there, but we would have sat at our table waiting for another 15 minutes if we hadn't gone up there. In the end just be aware of this; and they don't take American Express."}
{"text":"Amazing! We came in on a frigid winter day in montreal and smells  instantly overwhelmed us. The display cases were full of the most beautiful and delicious looking pastries. Macarons, tarts, cakes, palmers, croissants, canneles... Mmmmmm... We ended up opting for three canneles, one palmier (it was HUGE) and a chocolate eclair all for take out. Each one was perfect!"}
{"text":"Per Doctor Elsie W.'s review, we came here again. This past weekend might have been my third time in this place.

I recommend the croissants with cream inside, along with the lemon tart, apple crumb cake, and cappuccino! If you're driving from New York City, try to make this your final stop before departing so you can bring lots of baked goods back!

I saw a brunch menu, too, and I am looking forward to devouring everything when I come back again.

Parking can get difficult on this block, so park around the corner by the public meters and just walk back. Walking sounds easy, but not in negative six degrees Fahrenheit before wind chill!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST!
Their creativity, quality and everything...
The feeling of being there is great
The taste is great
The design... 
The materials they use..
Their coffee.. 
Their awesome and perfectly made sweets...
They are just the best in everything. Definitellllllllllllllllly recommended."}
{"text":"They have the best pastries in a bright enjoyable dining venue. The breakfast plank, Niçoise salad and club sandwich were amazing.  We are planning to go back before the end of our trip."}
{"text":"Skip the croissants/typical stuff. The magic is in the different and delicious tarts, cakes and mousses. 
We tried 3 different ones between 4 of us and my only regret is not trying more. 
So good. Also, solid coffee.
Go if you're feeling your sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Cute little pastry shop and cafe! Came here for a Tuesday lunch...had the royal lunch which came w a croque madame, light side salad, choice of beverage and dessert pastry for $22. Great illy coffee, the croque madame was crunchy and creamy, salad was refreshing, and the dessert pastry was delicate and not too sweet. For the dessert pastry, the waiter brings over a tray of around 15-20 to choose from! Overall, a great experience and would recommend."}
{"text":"What a nice little gem I found in downtown today! A few friends and I headed out for dessert today and we decided to give this place a try. From the moment we stepped in we were overwhelmed by all the dessert options. We asked for help to decide on a pastry and we were given tons of information on each dessert. I had the Mont Blanc with an english breakfast tea and it was a great combo. My friend had a macaroon and she loved it. The only downside for me was that it was a bit pricey but I enjoyed it nonetheless. There are cozy little spots for you to sit with friends and enjoy your treats."}
{"text":"Walk don't run and get yourself a chocolate almond croissant. Everything looked delicious. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"My family and I loved this shop. The pastries were as beautiful as they were tasty. I appreciated everything about this place : The decor, the very French feel and of course the delicious tastings. We tried the vegetable soup (3 servings!), a chicken club sandwich, a ham and cheese quiche, lemon meringue tart, macaroons, almond croissants and chocolate croissants. This is definitely on our list of places to visit the next time we are back in the gorgeous city of Montreal!"}
{"text":"Amazing! great breakfast but they serve only pastries and drinks, the real food starts coming out for lunch. I really enjoyed everything they bake. It is definitely worth the trip into Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Food: yummmmm~
Presentation: pretty. Can be better.
Arrangements: be more considerate to the diner. Although it was pretty to look at, eating was difficult.
Service: the person who took our order forgot 3/5 items. Person who brought the food, I felt like I need to serve her instead. Person who brought the check: nicest of all. There was an error, he apologized and fixed the error immediately. 
Overall: very cute place and good food composition. The lobster sandwich served on the choux was very unique. But the service experience degrades it."}
{"text":"I only wish I could have come back here several more times before I had to go home! Caught an early breakfast here on Saturday morning before flying home from Montreal. The shop is located in the quaint streets of the old city and has an almost magical air when you walk in. All of their pastries look and taste decadent. On weekends they have brunch that starts at 11am, but sadly I had to leave before then. I opted for the 'Royal Breakfast' which included a biscuit and homemade jam, a hot beverage, fresh squeezed OJ, and another pastry of your choice. I opted for the almond croissant and it was maybe the best almond croissant I have ever had. Perfectly flaky and not overwhelmingly filled with almond flavoring. Would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Located in a charming part of town, beautifully prepared Instagram-ready but subpar food served seemingly mostly to tourists. I got the brunch \"plank,\" which came with a drink, plain or chocolate croissant, ham or salmon benedict, french toast with caramel sauce, and fruit salad. The croissant was a bit overlooked, with a dry, firm texture. The toast was decent, but the caramel sauce was excellent. The benedict had a foam sauce that was on the bland side, the egg was nicely done with a gooey yolk, but the bread part was stale. The fruit salad was notably fresh, dressed with fruit juice. We also opted for an additional dessert from the display tray the waiter brought to the table, which was elaborately presented but seemed to suffer from refrigeration staleness- others at the table had a similar experience.

It's unfortunate that this ideally located place with wonderful staff serves such beautiful but mediocre food. It would earn my recommendation if the food tasted as good as it looked."}
{"text":"If you are ever lost, make sure it is in Old Montreal, on a warm winter's day on the way to this pastry shop. As we walked past beautiful shops and unique restaurants, we definitely built up an appetite for the tasty, well-baked offerings at this wonderful shop. Mid-afternoon, the elegant shop was full of friends catching up with each other, couples having a leisurely lunch, and tourists taking a well-deserved pause in their wanderings. I loved the large window overlooking the area, the fairly large tables, and transparent acrylic chairs. On each table, a colorful bird perched on a small silver tree - cute! While we waited for the pastry tray, I scoped out a beautiful smoked salmon salad and a delicious-looking lobster salad sandwich (on a brioche bun). We will need to better plan our meals next time around - both of us were just in the mood for dessert today. Given that we burned off a ton of calories while we were lost, we both got two desserts! At least that's the story that we're sticking to.

There were several interesting offerings: a Paris-Brest éclair with hazelnut cream; a wedge of flan, and a passion fruit/raspberry tarte. I went with both the mille-feuille and the canelé. The latter was okay: the crust was leathery as opposed to crusty while the interior was much better - a cross between custard and cake with a holely crumb. There was also definitely the heavenly fragrance of vanilla and rum.

The mille-feuille was outstanding. The pastry was buttery and flaky, as it should be but rarely is, almost as if the pastry chef piped the pastry cream just upon ordering. I enjoyed every forkful of this wonderful dessert. 

I also got to sample the caramel fleur de sel pudding. It was subtly sweet and flavorful.

The shop also sells quiches from their refrigerated case, as well as terrines and glacés. Shoppers can also find a selection of French macarons, jams, biscuits, marshmallows, and organic teas available for sale."}
{"text":"My sister recently discovered this new location of a favorite brunch place/pastry shop, replacing chocolatier Suite 88. We decided to combine a shopping trip with a light and delicious snack. The shop is narrow but large enough to showcase gourmet chocolates and organic teas available for purchase. As well, we saw prepared sandwiches, a dozen or so desserts, and on the day my sister visited earlier in the week, flaky almond croissants. Additionally, in the space, there is a small grouping of bistro tables and eye-catching red leather chairs for those taking a break.  

The shop offers a limited pastry menu, unlike its sister shop in Old Montreal. However, what it does offer is quite lovely. I enjoyed the Paris Brest éclair which featured a crisp and light pâte à choux and generous ribbons of chocolate-hazelnut cream. I also had a few bites of the chocolate-caramel tart, which boasted a strong dark chocolate and creamy caramel layers.

We appreciated the number of counter people ready to prepare our orders, make specialty coffee drinks, and clear off tables."}
{"text":"When we visit Montreal we always take our family to Christian Faure and we love it. Since we are here we went yesterday with our family and the service for the first time was terrible. The server, a man, was rushed, had no interest in us. He made us not ti want to go back!

You could tell he hates his job!  Then we wanted to take some pastries home for our son in law. He behaved as if he was making as a favor.  He also never went to check on us if we needed something. 

The pastries were good, not amazing as all the other times. Maybe Christian is on vacation. 

We will try it again, but will not stay if that server is there."}
{"text":"Best croissant I have ever had - Chocolate Almond croissant! The almand filing and chocolate are not mixed together so you get speck of chocolate in onebite and almond in another. Perfection."}
{"text":"I judge a place by its almond croissant so had to get one from this place. The space is very cute and serve is efficient. The almond croissant has a nice caramelization however the almond paste has too much liqueur(?) or almond extract added - there's just something alcoholic tasting that overpowers the natural fragrance of the almond."}
{"text":"Amazing macarons!!! Huge fan!  The coconut and cassis were spectacular!!  Wish they'd open a shop in dc!"}
{"text":"It's in the heart of tourist central, Old Montreal, so you know it's going to be expensive. Luckily the quality of the pastries (mango-raspberry tarts, amazing) and the interior is worth it. Service not really -- though the younger servers were very pleasant the manager was apparently working on his PhD in Arrogant French Caricature. I was seriously looking for the camera, so perfect were the stereotypes.

But whatever, don't let that dude ruin your day, make multiple elevator trips up to the toilet on the fourth floor and show him whose Maison this really is."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious and very nice staff!  We stumbled upon this place and it was a great find.  Will definitely return on our next Montreal trip"}
{"text":"Enfin une pâtisserie digne de ce nom à Montréal ! La Maison Christian Faure est un must, le top du top. C'est à la fois délicieux, ludique et éducatif. 
L'endroit est situé Rue Royale, en plein coeur du Vieux Montréal, face au Musée Pointe à Calière, dans un immeuble classé et plein d'histoire.

 Lorsqu'on pénètre les lieux, on est tout de suite frappé par la splendide fresque imaginé par la femme de Christian Faure, Pamela Balkalian. Elle a eu la très belle idée de retracer l'histoire des patissiers et boulangers des siècles derniers en utilisant d'anciennes sérigraphies d'époque reproduites sur le mur et colorées. Nous sommes déjà mis dans l'ambiance la Culture est au rendez-vous et le voyage s'annonce magique. 

En avançant, se dresse les merveilles de Christian. Christian Faure est lyonnais d'origine et il n'est pas un pâtissier comme les autres. C'est un MOF ! Un quoi? Un MOF: Meilleur Ouvrier de France ! Ce concours extrêmement exigeant sacre les meilleurs artisans, que l'on peut reconnaitre grâce à leur col bleu blanc rouge. 
Dans sa Maison, luxe et volupté sont aux rendez-vous pour les gourmands petits et grands: maccarons, crèmes glacée, guimauves, éclairs, millefeuilles, et mon préféré, une création de la  jeune Reem (associée de Christian et Paméla) une tarte gelée de framboise et crème aux fruits de la passion ! Rien que de l'écrire, j'en ai l'eau à la bouche. Et les cannelés ? A se rouler par terre !

Le service est impécable, irréprochable même. Discrétion, professionalisme, attention et gentillesse sont des adjectifs décrivant parfaitement toute l'équipe de ce lieu unique.
Cette Maison est bien plus qu'une simple pâtisserie ou qu'un coin snacking, c'est aussi une école. Les premier et deuxième étages sont dédiés à l'apprentissage et à la formation de jeunes apprentis ainsi qu'au grand public pour des ateliers. 
Le dernier étage abrite des salons privés idéal pour des déjeuners d'entreprise, des anniversaires ou des party de Noël. 

La française que je suis est particulièrement fière d'écrire cette revue. La Maison Christian Faure représente la grandeur de notre pays: le savoir-faire, la beauté, le goût, le choix de produits de qualité, l'envie de transmettre aux générations futures l'art de satisfaire les éternels gourmands."}
{"text":"Le paradis des sucrerie. Je ne suis pas très sucre mais quand je vais là-bas j'ai envie de tout essayer. Les gâteaux sont beaux et je suis sûre qu'ils sont bons aussi d'après les quelques gâteaux que j'ai mangé à la Maison Christian Faure."}
{"text":"Love their selections of cakes. This is the place for your French pastries sweet tooth! Delicious. I had the praline eclair. One word: Amazing! Loved it and the decor is so nice. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"i got a bunch of things that I'm not sure I can remember the name of. Overall, everything was amazing and had just the right amount of sweetness, so it wasn't cloyingly sweet. I REALLY enjoyed the passion fruit....tart? I don't know if I can call it a tart, but it was fruity, had great flavor and had this oozy fruit filling that just covered the plate when you cut into it. There was a dessert with a little custard on top and a rum syrup in it which was a little strong and on the sweet side for me. The canele didn't have the best texture ever, but I didn't exactly have it fresh, so that was bad on my part. The flavor had a hint of orange/citrus, I think, that made it so much better than some other caneles I've had. Since canele is one of my favorite desserts, I really appreciated what they did. My second favorite dessert from there was a coffee crumble with lemon curd and what seemed like meringue sticks on top. Coffee and lemon curd was such an interesting combination. I would say that is a must-try. 

while I was in the elevator en route to the bathrom, the elevator doors opened on the third floor, and I got a small peek into what I was told was the baking school associated with the bakery. I kinda wished I played the dumb tourist card and took a few photos. Darn."}
{"text":"We found this place purely because of Yelp! Thank you to all of you who reviewed and gave this incredible cafe such great reviews. You were spot on and we had the best impromptu brunch thanks to all of you. 

We were looking for a place to grab a bite in Montreal before going to the Montreal History Centre and Yelp steered us in this direction. There was a long wait because it was late on a Sunday morning and it was obviously prime brunch time, but I'm so glad that we waited. The wait gave us an opportunity to view the incredible selection of pastries and beautiful desserts and made us all that much more, when we sat down, that we wanted to order the brunch sur la planche, which may just be the greatest deal ever. $20 includes a fancy drink (think iced cappuccino, house-made lemonade, or the richest hot chocolate), a croissant/brioche/other danish of your choice, a completely phenomenal egg benedict on choux pastry with salmon or ham (get the salmon - it's better!), a fresh fruit salad, and a piece of brioche bread (think French toast) with caramel sauce. So incredibly good! Ask for the house-made raspberry jam for your croissant! 

The atmosphere is festive and fun and our servers were so warm and helpful. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The first impression is EVERYTHING to me, so I have to say... this place \"KILLED IT\" (Meaning they are my top 3) in the \"first impression department.\"

Great service: The staff was friendly and are bilingual, a big plus for me.:) 

Fast service: The gentleman at the front was VERY knowledgeable of all the items, he sounded like the owner actually, which is rare to meet the Owner at the front desk, but if not, he knew EVERYTHING about all the items

I'll be back, probably tomorrow..:) 

With regard to the actual desserts, OMG... that's all I can say Lolol. 
If you want find out, come to Montreal, google this name and go to \"Maison Christian Faure\", you are going to love it here.:)"}
{"text":"Such a lovely place situated in downtown. Really enjoyed the ambiance. We ordered a hot chocolate. One of the best I've drinked so far. It has consistency and it doesn't taste like sugar water. It is really sweet though. I mean it's chocolate right? Should be sweet. It cost 5$ +tax if you don't take it to go. A bit pricey but you won't be disappointed with the quality. They also have macarons, cakes, chocolates and many more. Their cakes look delicious qnd well presented. Will keep this place in mind when I will be craving sweets!"}
{"text":"When we walked it, I said, \"Is this the place?\" 
And someone walking out said, \"This is the place.\"

It was DEFINITELY THE PLACE!

Lunch: Quinoa salad and the beef sandwich. The beef sandwich was very good, but there are probably better things. The quinoa was EXCELLENT! 

Dessert: We had an enclair, which was good, but not the best ever. Then we had some white chocolate, lemon, crunchy thing with two sticks on top -- that was EXCELLENT! We also took home croissants and an elephant ear for breakfast the next morning.

Coffee: This was excellent as well, but I didn't realize it was $4 a cup. 

Over all our bill was $85 (including the tip), which is a little high for lunch, but we did have some take home goodies."}
{"text":"I was briefly visiting Montreal and decided that a trip to a pastry shop was in order. This is a small spot, but it's easy to find and there are a lot of options.

 I popped in there 30 minutes before it closed and it was pretty much empty. The young woman working there was very helpful whenever I asked her what some of the desserts were. I ended up choosing 3 different desserts and a couple of macarons, I paid around $25 for that. I got all of those to go, and they provided a nice to go box for me to carry my goods. 

Every single thing that I got was delicious! The macarons were heavenly, I regretted not getting more of them. Overall if you have a sweet tooth and enjoy tasty treats you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What a solid disappointment. Our hotel concierge suggested we go there as I was interested in coffee and pastry that morning. Since I was searching for a delectable pastry I was full of anticipation as I entered this small restaurant. Our waitress took forever to notice us and our coffee never arrived. There turned out to be several tables waiting patiently for a cup of coffee!!  I asked for a pastry and received a glippy-gloppy tort of some kind. Still waiting for a cup of java I asked for a pastry typically served with coffee. I received something obnoxious vaguely called a bike ride (??). It was terrible and much too rich to accompany a morning coffee. While they apologized for everyone waiting for their coffee that kindness was cancelled out by both the tardy coffee and huge bill. Stay away from this place and have your bear claw elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Loved it , service was very friendly, they come to ask if everything is satisfying your need or not. And the food were delicious. Had the lemon meringue while my friend had the fruit tart (stole some of her portion). They were fresh since they were just made, flavor was very rich and smooth. Would come again to try other desserts."}
{"text":"Great location and ambiance in Old Montreal. Tried a passion fruit & raspberry tart, a chocolate financier and an illy latte. So good. But very slow and inattentive service, which i wasnt expecting from a place like this."}
{"text":"Pastries and desserts are out of this world.  They're so beautiful to look at I didn't want to eat them (but I did).  The service wasn't the best, it was pretty slow and unfriendly, and they ran out of orange juice during Sunday brunch.  Otherwise they'd have 5 stars."}
{"text":"Breakfast was perfect, ham and cheese croissant and the croissant combo for my wife.  Coffee was perfect, and a dozen macarons to go... I only wish we had time to go back..."}
{"text":"I came here to get some dessert to go. The place was packed when I arrived but no line if you want to dine. I was actually a bit disappointed because I think there wasn't a wide selection compared to what I saw from other reviews. I got the chocolate cake with pralines and ate it when I got home. I think it was a bit expensive ($7.75) for a small cake though. But when I got a taste of it, I think it was all worth it! I haven't had any good desserts in the Boston area so I was really happy with this one. I wish I bought more before I left Montreal."}
{"text":"The macaroons are so good that you'll imagine eating them in a giant PAC-MAN video game."}
{"text":"The place is awesome, Really & Truly.
There are two retail locations of the pastry school- one in Old Montreal and the other off Rue Stanley? n the city center.
The pastries are classic and delicious.
Great staff- Lucy and Noel, and company will help you with any questions. I've been there a few times and last time they gave me a sample of fresh squeezed OJ while we were chatting. The jams are superb"}
{"text":"Was recommended to stop by here for pastries so I made my way here for breakfast. It's a super girlie, chic little bakery/cafe and everything looked perfect. From the small cakes to the macarons to the croissants, everything looked gorgeous.  We ended up ordering a couple of the chocolate almond croissants and the brioche. The chocolate croissant was buttery and so rich and was worth every calorie. Loved!"}
{"text":"If I had a \"Top 5 Brunch spots in North America\" list, Maison Christian Faure would be on it. TOP 3 EVEN.

I'm completely amazed that this bakery can be so successful on both ends- as a pastry shop and a brunch spot. Its the cutest little cafe tucked on a side street between Old Montreal and Old Port. We walked in around 11 am and were seated by the window. 

We ordered:
1. brunch special = smoked salmon puff pastry (choux) which came with the BEST french toast I've ever had, plus a fruit salad, pastry of your choice, and coffee/juice (we went with the chocolate croissant: THIS IS THE BEST CHOCOLATE CROISSANT EVER. This is really how it should be. Going back to a normal chocolate croissant would now be a crime.) 
2. lobster puff pastry = heaven. 

Quite frankly, I now believe that everything should be on a puff pastry and we should do away with bread. 

Everything is beautifully presented and completely melts in your mouth like butter. I'm back in NY now and I'm still thinking of this place! The next time I'm back in Montreal, I will definitely make it a point to come back here again. and again.

Servers were absolutely sweet. The energy of this place is absolutely lovely, and there's nothing like the sun streaming through the windows as you enjoy a wonderful brunch here. Someone bring me back...please!"}
{"text":"A must stop if you want to try out some of the best Montreal cakes and pastries! The chocolate cake was very rich and the vanilla and strawberry layered cake was unlike any vanilla and strawberry cake that I've ever had. I was reading reviews and like one of my fellow posters have said, Yelp ain't lying about Maison Christian Faure. The pastry shop itself is very cute and there are several floors, including levels where students learn to master the fine art of creating these spectacular pastries! My one regret is not buying the macarons and bringing them back home to Toronto. Oh well, next time!"}
{"text":"Cute place for brunch or a treat from the bakery -- 

You get into line and as you get closer to the cashier, you'll be asked if you're eating in. If take out, you stay in line. If eating in, the server will clear a table for you and bring you menus with the sandwich/salad options (not sure if you can order those items for take out, or only the pastries/bakery items). 

Our food:
Brunch on the Plank: orange juice, croissant, eggs benedict on a choux pastry with smoked salmon, brioche \"nanterre\" with caramel sauce, mini fruit cup. The OJ was wonderful, definitely freshly squeezed. I didn't try the eggs benedict since the portion was so small - he said it was good, though the hollandaise sauce was different than the norm. The caramel sauce for the brioche was delicious and decadent. Fruit cup was mostly pineapple and melon.

Crab/lobster salad on a choux pastry: amazing presentation and decent chunks of lobster meat evident, but the choux pastry itself didn't taste fresh. 

The croissant from the brunch on the plank was delicious enough that we ordered another - note that they are more soft/flaky than crispy.

Lemonade: too tart for me

Total was $42 with taxes, before tip."}
{"text":"Came here a few years back and loved it so I returned to take out a few baked goods while on a business trip and my memory of this place is now ruined. The man helping was extremely rude and unfriendly. I also needed a receipt in which he was also very rude and annoyed about (!?). It was an odd hour in the morning so they were not busy at all. No excuse for this. 

The croissants were also not as good as I remembered. Not worth it. I recommended this place to everyone who said they were visiting Montreal but I'll now be doing the opposite. There are plenty of places for delicious croissants and desserts in Montreal like Olive & Gourmando down the street which is much busier (now I know why) and have much friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place was such a let down after reading so many positive reviews. 

We came here for an afternoon snack after hitting a couple tourist spots in Ville Marie. Upon entering, we were motioned to take a seat anywhere (it was pretty packed with may be 3 open tables, so we took one). Someone will come around with a plate of pastries and will answer any questions you have about each. This is super informative and professional.

I got the yuzu eclair, which I've been missing since Paris, and my cousin strawberry cake. The cream on and inside the eclair was pretty solid, though can get overwhelming (3.5 stars?), but the eclair itself.. so, so, dry and disappointing. Sure, the cream somewhat compensates? but the texture was just off. The strawberry cake, however, was even more of a let down - the cream was way too overwhelmingly sweet that it almost tasted artificial, though the airy texture was there, and the cake was also so dry that it tasted like it came from an overbaked box mix.

Each pastry I believe was ~$6, unacceptable for the quality. 

We also waited ~45min from when we asked for the check to when we received our change (we gave a 20). We had to ask our waiter for the change, and it turned out that he had completely forgotten about/lost our change. Sure they were busy, so let's keep the 2 stars.

Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"If there is one thing the French can do well is cook and certainly the French excel in baking.  After yelping around for a good place to pick up a pastry and a coffee, I found Maison Christian Faure.  With the credentials of this place, I had pretty high expectations.  

We walked in shortly after they had opened and the poor girl was running the place by herself.  She was trying to prep for the day, lay out the pastries, and serve a number of guests already seated.  Besides the bumpy start, the pastries here could be smelt a few blocks away, and they looked even more beautiful.  I ordered an almond croissant and it was.....easily one of the best almond croissants I've had.  Their madeline cookie that came with our coffee was equally delicious.

All the baking is done on premises (upstairs) and this is also a baking school.  If you're visiting Old Montreal, you NEED to come here and try some of their baked goods.  The only regret I had was not ordering more items, next time, there's always next time."}
{"text":"Monday brunch shared with my daughter. Chicken club sandwich with fried egg, mayo, lettuce, tomato served with small salad and chips was delish. Croissant, and 2 pastries from tray---OMG! Felt like we were back in Paris. Finished with an iced cappuccino and fresh squeezed lemonade."}
{"text":"We had discovered Maison Christian's smaller purpose near our hotel so we opted to grab brunch at the larger spot in Old Montreal. The pain au chocolat was well baked but had very little chocolate. The platter of eggs Benedict with salmon, fruit, and brioche with caramel was nice. I really enjoyed their hot chocolate as well."}
{"text":"We were walking by and discovered this place near our hotel. I'm glad we did. Bought marshmallows, chocolate, coffee, and chocolate almond croissant. All were great. We came several days in a row."}
{"text":"You can NOT list the Top 25 Patisseries in the world, and not have Maison Christian Faure not on it...

I really don't understand it. Is it his title: Meilleur Ouvrier de France (MOF)? The swanky décor? The Old Montreal location? The price points? Because, there is no reason related to artistry and craftsmanship that this patisserie isn't rated even higher than it is... on yelp, google, all the democratic rating sites...

You'll find all kinds of elegant classic French pastries along with seasonal desserts at Maison Christian Faure (MCF) - classic in the sense that they are viewed through the master patissier's interpretation. Two that I'll bring up: Millefeuille and Paris Brest. So, Jacques Genin in Paris is reputed to have the best version of millefeuille around, benefiting texturally from the fact that it's made-to-order. MCF's version is pretty fantastic, and stayed in my memory after many months. But, I don't think I've had better Paris-Brest in my life. I must confess, I've never been a fan of Paris-Brest thinking it to be sickeningly sweet and way too rich for my liking, but the Paris-Brest éclair at MCF with hazelnut praline filling is definitively the best version I've had. There's tremendous attention to detail on each element and how they work together, including the candied hazelnuts.

I also have to thank Maison Christian Faure for reviving my love for French pastry. Hard that it may be to imagine, I went through a 1.5-2 year period not enthused by desserts, or indeed any French style bakery in the U.S. But, the first bite I had of Le Miami at MCF, it all came back. What better pastry to remind one of the magic of French patisseries! Lightly sweet cookie crust, almond cream, lime cream, raspberry jelly, and fresh raspberries. I normally don't stop eating dessert to take multiple pictures of it while I progress further, but every few bites or so I had to remind myself to store memories of a new pleasurable sensation!

The other pastry I enjoyed thoroughly was Le Venitien (hazelnut cake, crunchy hazelnut praline, lemon mousse, and confit). While a few months later, the winter collection featured an excellent Croustillant de Pralin (a crunchy dark chocolate pastry with praline and hazelnuts) reminding me of the pastry chef's facility with all the featured ingredients.

As you can sense the artistry, I was determined to read more about Faure and his philosophy, and really liked something he'd said: \"No one walks into a patisserie starving. They simply want a treat. You eat pastry for pleasure and happiness... each pastry should be an experience\". I couldn't agree more. I also love his discipline in staying away from becoming a factory like operation, for not carrying cupcakes just because they are ubiquitous or following a food fashion trend like the cronut. Faure is an absolute master of his craft: I tried six different things and there wasn't anything I didn't like - including chocolate sable cookies that are rolled in sugar to give the effect of sparkling diamonds!"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing.  We visited today and had  couplr macaroons(2.5 each), chocolate croissant, and a fancy pastry ($6, maybe caramel?). We did sit inside, but you can take ut to go also. On the 3rd floor you will find students making these delicious treats. So good!"}
{"text":"La Maison Faure est la plus Forte dans son domaine j'aime la visiter à chaque venue sur Montréal vous aussi allez y sans modération"}
{"text":"Very modern and pretty interior. Top notch croissants, flaky and on point. Very good chocolate croissant too. Very high quality chocolate."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced. Very nice atmosphere, cute shop. Macarons were alright. They were out of some of the pastries. Probably wouldn't go again, honestly."}
{"text":"We were walking around Old Port and eventually made our way out to this place since it came highly recommended by a good friend who is a local.

Pastries and coffee were good (they serve Illy Coffee) but certainly nothing to write home about. I've had better back home in the states for less. Hence the 1 star.

Service: horrendous! 

We were sat rather quickly but was ignored for a good while (10+ minutes) by everyone before someone gave us a menu. It was a hot day, they wouldn't even give us water until after we had ordered. I have never felt so unwelcome in my lifetime.

Our server was an unpleasant man who after taking our order came with a tray (which he proceeded to slam down on our table) of the pastry selection and rather swiftly hurried through the description of them. 

We ordered, ate quite silently. They didn't come by to ask if we needed anything else, ask if everything was ok, or if we needed (god forbid) more water. The server just assumed we were ready for the check once we were done with our food. I was no longer in the mood for any other pastry at that point, I thought about trying two others before the whole ordeal.

How do we know they treated us worse than the others? A table next to us was engaged in friendly conversation with light laughter whilst being served endless amounts of water.
A table across from us got their pastries and drinks quite right away after being sat.
Two to three tables that came a long time after us got their pastries and drinks before we had even finished ours.

The boyfriend and I usually tip well since we are in the industry, but boy did it hurt physically to even give them the 15%!

Short and sweet: your pastries are ruined by the rude service. I would rather get stuff to go if I ever come back. Teach your servers not to judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"This was one of the highlights of a recent trip to Montreal.  Everything, from breakfast pastries, to the desserts and coffee was fantastic.  The service was excellent and I had one of the best almond croissants I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  These little treats are made of heaven!  My mouth was soooooo happy when we found this gem!!!!"}
{"text":"While everything looks beautiful the food could better. Everything we tried was way too greasy and overpriced. Burned black croissants saturated with butter. Coffee was just ok... There are plenty of coffee shops withing walking distance  that have better baked product and better coffe... Sandwiches are overpriced..."}
{"text":"Located by the waterfront in Old Port, Maison Christian Faure is naturally bound to have a large touristy population swarm in to get their fix of French pastries. While I begrudgingly want to tell most of them that Montréal's food culture is distinct from France/Paris' and that business owners use French food's \"fanciness\" as an excuse to jack up the prices, it's actually not so bad here. Would I say that some of the items are overpriced? Definitely. But there is some sort of quality assurance to be found.

The first time I was here, I ordered a club sandwich and a raspberry passion fruit tart. Although it cost $16 and came with a ton of kettle-cooked potato chips (not complaining), it tasted really good, and the chefs did a great job at making normally-dry chicken breast retain some moisture??? The tart was absolutely divine and fruity - although I would have liked a less hard crust for me to cut through in order to avoid potential messes. I got a cappuccino to finish the meal, and it was made with illy coffee and tasted nice and strong, just how I like it.

I bought a cake here the second time, and it was a lovingly adorned fruit cake with the toppings arranged pretty meticulously. The ladyfingers surrounding the base was probably one of my favorite parts, and overall it tasted moist and fresh, despite me thinking that $36 for a six-serving cake is quite expensive.

My French friends have mentioned that you can get better-quality pastries for half the price back in their home country, which I do believe based off of my own excursions there. This will have to do as a substitute in the meantime until I can find a more authentic alternative, I guess."}
{"text":"Super good passion fruit tart ya'll. Loved it. Even 2 days after I bought it, still good. Decent macaron. Not the best ever but very good. 4.5 overall. I like that they have a to-go counter. Get there early if you want their almond croissant."}
{"text":"C'est mignon comme tout lorsqu'on rentre. Nous avons eu une table rapidement malgré le linup. Le café était bon. Plusieurs choix de pâtisseries qui semblent aussi bonnes une que l'autre. Le serveur passe au table pour venir expliquer avec le plateau. 
Pour ma part, j'ai pris une tarte au citron. Probablement la mei de ma vie. Mon conjoint a essayé le Mont-Blanc qui était vraiment bon, quoi qu'un peu trop sucré pour moi.
Lorsque nous sommes sortis du restaurant, après avoir payé la facture, un serveur nous a couru après pour savoir si nous avions vraiment payés. Un peu insultant. Le reste ça allait!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by several Yelpers and I'm glad I had the chance to go.  Located in Old Montreal it is a pastry shop plus it has a small section for brunch/lunch.  Unfortunately as I took a tad too long at the spa in the morning I missed the cutoff for lunch (3pm on weekdays - not sure about the weekends).  So I settled for drooling over the beautiful cakes, pastries and of course the macarons.  Oh those macarons!   You can get 6 or 12 boxed set (your choice of which macarons) or just buy single ones.  I chose the 6 pack plus a passion fruit and raspberry tarte and the total came up to $22 with tax (I can't remember how much each pastry item cost).  There is also a small fridge that houses larger cakes and some deliciously looking sorbets.  I really wanted to try the sorbets but I remember looking at the price and the small amount of sorbet and just couldn't justify it.  Maybe next time.

The shop itself is pretty tiny so I can only imagine how crowded it must get during the weekends.  I did peek around to see the sitting area and it did also look a little crammed together with the tables so maybe try a weekday if you really want to try brunch here. 

Now I'm going to be honest - I've had the macarons in Paris (Laduree) and those are the absolute best - sorry but nothing can compare to those for me.  But these are a good option if you don't want to fly to Paris!

The tarte was just so beautiful I almost didn't want to eat it...but I did!  Such an explosion of flavours - the passion fruit mixed with the tartness of the raspberry was just heaven.  I prefer desserts with a more bite tarte, sour) than super sweet so this was perfect for me."}
{"text":"The best chocolate-almond croissant! Wonderful people and service!! I thoroughly enjoyed. Wish I could be more there were so many wonderful pastries and desserts"}
{"text":"Was wondering in Old Montreal an afternoon looking for a place to buy some croissant. They seated us nevertheless and offered a large selection of pastries. They are just so-so in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ok we just cant get enough chocolate croissants. Or regular croissants. Breakfast here looked light but was quite heavy! I got the goat cheese zucchini quiche. Came with a great little salad at brunch. We also enjoyed espressos and ended the meal with some great little desserts. 
The only thing keeping this from a 5 was the rather confused waitstaff - everyone was helping everyone which was cool until no one was helping anyone and multiple tables were waiting on their checks. And the almost-too-hard crust on my tart.. it was really rough to eat. But delicious. So I would still go back."}
{"text":"Le croissant aux amandes est à se rouler par terre. Accompagné d'un café latte, le bonheur est à son comble."}

{"text":"Best croissant ever had!! Nice decoration inside and various kinds of pastries provided~ Canele I had that day seemed baked not very well but another unknown dessert (called tigre? I don't know french, sorry) was divine!! Felt pity that I haven't try their Napoleon and macaroon."}
{"text":"The Maison Christian Faure Pastry School is run by Chef Christian Faure Meilleurs Ouvriers de France, and is located in the Old Montreal area.  This place is an on-site bakery and snacking area in which the chef and his team offers a variety of classic and contemporary desserts.  In addition, there are also baking/pastry classes that you can sign-up and register for that's offered to the public.  I stopped by to check out their cake selections, and behind the glass casing, they were really pretty to look at.  I decided on a Framboisette, a little cake that was dusted with powdered sugar with a raspberry puree-covered dome made out of chocolate mousse, and encased with a decorative white chocolate.  There was even a small little white flower set to close this wrap-around 'case.'  I wasn't really much of a fan of the cake base, as it was dense and dry; the raspberry encased dome was much better, but it was more chocolate mousse-based, rather than the raspberries.  The little cafe area was bright and white, with plastic chairs and a minimal space for those who wanted to dine-in.  There are also sandwiches and lunch specials that you can order off the menu.  Service was friendly and quick, and you pay up at the bakery case after you're done.

{"text":"The pro:  the pastry is good
The cons: the atmosphere is kinda bland compared to patisseries/boulangeries of similar caliber in town. The pricing is misleading/marginally dishonest. Pastries are not labeled at all. If u get a piece \"for here\" it's about $8.50. If u get the same thing \"to go\", it costs $6 (same thing w/ drinks). I would have felt better about this if the price difference was described as gratuity, but it's not. Its just plain rip-off"}
{"text":"I probably would have had a better experience picking up some pastries to-go, as opposed to dining in. Service was a mixed bag from various staff members, and ended up being a bit slow and sloppy throughout our brunch experience. I was also initially told they were out of a pastry I really wanted, even though there were a few sitting in the window... not sure what happened there. 

While the latte I ordered was sub-par and pricey, the quality of the pastries was generally good. My sister and I ended up with a Pâté Croute to share, as well as 4 pastries: Mont-blanc, Mango Mousse Tart, Framboisette, and Harlequin. Flavor-wise, I loved the Mont-blanc, with its chestnut cream and gelée de cassis. It tasted a bit booze-y, which was awesome. The other pastries were also good - but some had tart shells that were a bit too solid such that I accidentally sent a piece flying when trying to break off a piece of the mango tart with my spoon. 

We got there in the early afternoon, so the pastry selection was probably reduced by that point. I would probably recommend checking this place out earlier in the day, and would recommend taking out rather than dining in."}

I came for a macaron but got a quick breakfast instead.
Ordered the breakfast special which consist of coffee, a danish/croissant, a lemon cake and a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice.

Magnificent! 

The croissant - buttery and flakey.  Delicious raspberry jam.
Lemon cake - moist with a slight lemony flavor.
Orange juice - freshly squeezed.  Not tart.
Coffee - I ordered an Americano - smooth, and rich.

There is a refrigerator case of to go items.
Nice ambiance with awesome music.

On my 2nd visit we bought a box of six macarons.  A perfectly made macaron.

*Cassis - A different taste for a macaron.  Very good!

*Mango - delicious flavor."}

{"text":"The French pastry was over the top but the gravlax breakfast was fabulous!  A must try when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm excellent desserts
We were there at a nice Montreal evening by their closing time. We were the last two persons there and as I find it so calm I decided to fine myself by not have any of the desserts. I just wanted a live ambience that I can sit, relax and enjoy our time. I was heading out when I decided to go to washroom. So asked the lady behind the counter and although it was their closing time she kindly told me to take the elevator to level 4 and i'll find washrooms on my right. I just figured out that the place is not just a french patisserie but also a pastry school, when I was in the elevator reading floors names. So I decided to grab a bite on my way back to the car and relax in the car as oppose to any place which is open and omg I had the nicest eclair in my life. A hazelnut eclair a taste of the heaven. For Sure when ever I'll back in Montreal this place is a must visit before 7 p.m.
Thanks to the amazing team of pastry chefs"}

{"text":"Pretentious, clean. The coffee was good, the lemonade acceptable, the macaroons.... Yes, yes, yes! Also, this place was surgically clean."}
{"text":"A friend who has traveled to Montreal recommended this spot for dessert/pastries. There is a wide selection of desserts ranging from chocolates, macaroons, cakes, ice creams and specialty desserts. I ordered a few macaroons and my boyfriend ordered a pot de caramel dessert and I regret I didn't order a more complex dessert. His dessert had a salted caramel pudding/custard on top of brownies served in a tiny dish but was packed with a ton of flavor. Would recommend breaking out your usual dessert liking and try something more extravagant here. You have the choice of ordering to go or dining in. There is a small area to sit and enjoy your dessert. Would recommend this spot to those craving not your average dessert."}

{"text":"Maison Christian Faure is, simply put, a gem!

Located in the beautiful Old Town of Montreal across the street from the excellent Archaeological Museum this little pattiserie packs a huge punch! The restaurant/shop is very hip and stylish with a modern, bright atmosphere.  Apparently there is a baking school above the restaurant, with the production shop/kitchen downstairs.

Every baked item we had here over two visits was amazing! I did the plain croissant twice because it may be the best that I have ever had, anywhere!  The first lunch I had here I enjoyed a lobster and crab salad in choux pastry...delicious! We did brunch here on our last day in Montreal (Saturday) and had the \"benedict\" - they offered either ham or smoked salmon.  Both were in choux pastry with a light foam on top in lieu of the normal hollandaise sauce (I had the ham and my wife had the salmon).  They were both a wonderful, light riff on the traditional beloved benedict!

The joint also serves Illy coffee, which is generally a plus...they did great with cappucinos and with longhe espressos.

The only gripe I have with the place was the service was a bit haphazard.  They would be very attentive, but then would just forget about you once the food was brought out...no more water refills, no checking to see if you wanted anything else, etc.  So, go for the food and live with the service...it isn't bad service, just less attentive than I would really like.

On the whole though, I whole-heartedly recommend Maison Christian Faure to anyone looking for a good breakfast / lunch place in Montreal...we spent two meals on our foodie honeymoon in Quebec there, so I promise you that it is legit!"}

{"text":"If I could give this 10 stars, I would in a heartbeat. Except I can only give 5 :( I'm not usually a brunch girl, but this place got me head over heels. Service was slightly MIA at times, but nothing to fret over. The salmon was fishier than what I'm used to, but it balanced out the fruit, french toast, and danish. Omg their pastries....bring back one of each if you can. The apple tart and croissant was absolutely amazing. At one point, the server asked us if we could move our table slightly to make room for others, and then five min later...he came back with a whole dish of colorful beautiful macarons to make up for the \"inconvenience.\" My family and I were floored...like this is amazing. I don't even usually like macarons, but they managed to change my mind about them here. Cutest tea bins ever. We came back a second day to order more stuff to go this time, only sad part is that they forgot to include the hazelnut chocolate eclair in our order :(( Most adorable shop ever...definite must try."}

We tried 4 pastries and I'm still upset we didn't try the 5th (the lemon).
My favorite was the one with apricot because it balanced the sweet with the tart. DELICIOUS! A must see."}
{"text":"Exceptional and beautifully executed in decor, taste, selection, and service.  Amazing! 

Our hotel highly recommended this pastry shop to us so off we talked the Old Town streets for some treats.  After marveling over (and taking pics of) the gorgeous pastries in the bright and light storefront, we decided to do the brunch special.  

So, imagine this brunch: 

A beautifully crafted pastry puff egg benedict with salmon, homemade brioche toast (French toast, obvs) with a marvelous caramel sauce, very fresh fruit, followed by a pastry of choice (I choose praline in case you were wondering), with a cup of homemade melted chocolate in a perfect little white mug (calling it hot chocolate doesn't feel quite right here), all while overhearing the romantic and tender French language all around me and listening to the rain outside the quaint streets of Old Town.  

Sounds pretty darn awful, doesn't it? ;) 

Overall our gastronomic experiences in Montreal were excellent but this was superior."}
{"text":"Too much hype. 

After read so many positive feedbacks on Yelp, we decided to go there for afternoon tea. The place was just okay, but the waiter and waitress were HORRIBLE! We stood there for so long and they kept on saying that someone will help us shortly, but they just kept on doing something else (tried to look busy). The store wasn't even packed and there were only few customers in the store."}
{"text":"This\" Magic Christian \"Faure puts out some of the most
elegant and artfully crafted patisserie to be found
anywhere on the planet. He does it in his own Maison

Our lunch here was fun, flavorful,and filling.
We ordered the plat du jour special which includes  cafe and your choice of one of the marvelous looking and tasting pastries. We chose the smoked salmon
Club sandwich which was served triple decker on thick slices of toasted Maison baked white bread, crusts removed. The smoked salmon layer was slathered in Christian's Mayonaise Maison and the upper layer
surprised with a lightly fried egg ,lettuce and tomato.The sammich was accompanied by nicely done house potato chips and a small but tasty salad.
For the pastry course our server came by with a tray 
of these most beautiful choices. It doesn't matter which 
One you choose. Your not going to find better.
Chocolate hazelnut ganache..boom. Mille-Feuilles ;this is how we do!  BTW Christian Faure runs a pastry
Making school on the premises.
So if you want the quality of having a lunch in a top 
French hotel restaurant or in a Boulud type place with out the stuffiness or the great expense this is it.
It can get busy and service a little spotty but understandable given the attention to detail paid to the offerings here."}

Many people complained about the service, and well, we did have to ask for more water and for our check, otherwise, we may have waited a long time.  But the food was great and the wait staff had great attitudes and were so friendly.  We even had dessert and coffee.  Loved it so much that we went back the following day to get some pastries for our train ride to Toronto.  With better air conditioning, I'd give this 5 stars.  YUM!!"}

All very delicious and at a very reasonable price."}

We popped in to escape the rain. It is conveniently located in Old Montreal. At first we were just going to have a pastry, but then decided to do brunch which was the best decision ever!!! Brunch is $20  which included a drink, eggs benedict, fruit, brioche, and danish. We decided to upgrade from the danish to a pastry for $3. I had the cappachino, eggs benedict with salmon, and a cream puff with macaroon on top. The entire meal was absolutely delicious and very filling.

I cannot recommend this place enough."}

We had the quiche which was a generous slice and was one of the best quiches I've ever had. We also had a few pastries which were all delicious. The chocolate raspberry cake was out of this world. Service was quick and friendly. I would definitely stop by again for breakfast or lunch if I was in the area."}

this made me sad and I was irritated that I walked the treacherous icy terrain of Montreal to get there."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience we had during our Montreal tourist weekend. Which is sad, since this place is a beautiful spot in Old Montreal where you can sit back and enjoy the neighbourhood with a nice cup of tea and a pastry. Unfortunately, service (or lack of it) was terrible for us.

We walked in and marvelled at how chic and pretty the space was - it's a beautiful cafe. We informed the server at the front that we wanted to sit in, and we were told to seat ourselves, so we did... and so began the most awkward table service experience ever! Is it because we look young? We were wearing jeans? Hair out of place? Who knows. But for our ENTIRE meal, every guest around us was approached by a server, served with water, offered a variety of pastries to order from a tray... except us. Imagine being in a restaurant and not being acknowledged throughout your entire time there - this was it. NOT ONCE were we ever approached by a server, offered water, offered pastries to order (they bring them around in a tray), etc. We ended up going to the takeout display to find pastries, carry the pastries to our table using the server's own trays (like peasants), walk around trying to find water... let me tell you, being a pseudo-server for your own table is super awkward. No eye contact, no one even came to clean up our table, even when we tried to wave them down (multiple times). Did we swallow an invisible pill, or what?

When it came time to pay, we went up to the takeout counter since no one brought us a bill, and the same servers who ignored us questioned, \"Did you want to pay? What exactly did you order?\" They had no idea what we ordered at all - we could have lied (we didn't) and they wouldn't have known the difference. And then proceeded to indicate the tip option on the credit machine. For what service? What a terrible experience, in such a beautiful cafe. 

The pastries themselves were fine, but were totally tainted by the experience. Probably won't be back - in a city like Montreal, there are many other places for pastries with probably infinitely better service."}
{"text":"As someone who doesn't drink coffee, you may not be surprised I didn't like this place. They couldn't accommodate a request for a Chai Latte so I skipped straight to a glass of wine which I consider to be an acceptable swap-out. I grabbed a tasty citrus pastry but there were small choices that kept me from being able to take anything else on the menu (nuts in the brownies for example). Although my food and beverage were alright (considering $16+tax between the two), the service left too much to be desired.

Our table was not cleared of dishes until (what I can only assume was) long after we were gone. My biggest beef? Two well-off women go to pay and get the all-star treatment, yet I was not offered so much as a \"hello\", \"how was your ______\" or any words for that matter, just told \"23.80, by card?\".

Ex-effing-scuse me? You were so lazy and uncaring about the service you offered that you didn't even see if I wanted the bill to be split? ZERO service throughout the hour that we were there and I will certainly not be back. Apparently it's a great pastry school, so I would suggest you grab summer treats for TAKE OUT."}
{"text":"i had the best palmier here!  All their pastries are mouth-watering and i wish i tried one of each, but due to limited time, i was able to try their palmier, almond croissant and their macaroons.  The palmier was crispy, sweet and flaky - a super dance party in my mouth.  I wish i could have savored every moment and bite!  

The almond croissant was pretty good too!  The filling is not as sweet at others I've tried (which is to my preference) and the flakiness of the croissant was perfect!  

I wasn't a huge fan of their macaroons.  They are not bad, but also not out of the world.  If you come here, i would recommend trying all their pastries and elsewhere for macaroons.  I will come back when i visit montreal again! :)"}
{"text":"Not as good as before. Cake tasted like store bought. Also became super crowded with tourists. No service at all, had to call the waitress many times for her to give us water and order. What happened to this dessert house?!"}
{"text":"Charming French bakery in Old Montreal. Beautiful arrangement of pastries. The croissant was a bit too sweet and overcooked for my liking. However, the desert fruit/ citrus tarte was incredible. Kind of pricey, but the quality of the desert stuff is very good. Good service."}
{"text":"I noticed these folks immediately before heading to an early dinner and set myself up for having Dessert here instead.

This spot is a totally different bag of chips from their sister Boulevard de Maisonneuve location: there's a pastry school here on one of the floors and Café on another. Just the vibe alone, this location actually seems more \"formal\" with a café flair, small tables, a delicious Dessert Menu and wonderful table service. While the other location over at Maisonneuve, you order from the counter and has a lounge-y type feel. 

Entrance here though, leads you right upstairs- giving you a sneak peak to their kitchen at the same time. And then- just then....you smell Butter, Vanilla and Chocolate in the air. There's a short wait- but don't give up, pastries here are worth the time and money. Heads up guys and double check.....(unless it's changed from the last several months I was here)- this location offers a quick nosh menu up to a certain time of the day. After that, it's strictly a Dessert Menu...so I was all in!!!

Decided on a Chestnut Mousse pastry with the most sinful amount of butter in that shortbread crust. My Hot Chocolate or Hot Cocoa (not sure which), had strength and thickness in every sip.

Service was excellent the short time we were there. Again- it's the pleasantries that I love about Montréal! I'd come back for Dessert again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Maison Christian Faure- definitely takes it to the Max!!! And their Hot Chocolate is rightfully so!!! But I'll give you some more of that later. Let me just get some logistics out the way......

Located in busy, Blvd. de Maisonneuve, Maison Christian has a crisp layout style divided in two- (bit awkward, but works): Lounge area to your right with these popping red, comfy chairs. Then walk 'in' to the other area with a certain smoothness that carries through. Then you'll see Maison's gift sets and 2 window, high stools. 

And then the mother lode of them all... Truffles of all kinds in glass cases that are ready to be picked. Not to mention, their Chocolate Pastries all looked like masterpieces! Chloé was a delight and professional. But while I was there, I had to get something off my chest first and asked....\"how do you prepare your Hot Chocolate?\" 

And boy...did she give me the low-down and said, \"we use Dark and Milk Chocolate chips with caramel chips- also. (Oh....and she wasn't even finished yet). \"Then we use cream and less of milk\". And Boom! She had me all over it!!!

We knew the Hot Chocolate would take a bit so we started with Dessert- that were entirely fabulous and brought on a tray. Loved it! Underneath all that foam was a cup of Hot Chocolate that looked like f*cking diesel. Taste? Wild factor! 

I have a real serious chocolate weakness that always follows me and I...can't help it. I'm gonna go all out with a 5 because Maison, delivered with every bite- every sip!! It's just the perfect indulgence in Montréal."}
{"text":"Really good and beautiful macarons and pastries, just ok coffee and food."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé traveled to the great country of Canada from Atlanta. This was one of the stops on our list for desserts. This place over delivered with amazing treats truly scrumptious is all I could say after one bite of the passion fruit tart. Words cannot express the taste one of the best one bites I ever had. The chef came out of the kitchen greeting the patrons it was simply amazing"}
{"text":"Love this homemake Delicious french pastries, every staffs are very friendly and efficacy. The store is very clean and modern. This is a perfect place If you looking for a good coffee, high quality of patisseries , relax with friends. Will definitively come back. Highly recommend. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Delightful French bakery but somewhat pricey. You must go early to get their amandines cause they run out!

Had their lunch menu with was pretty good but the lobster bisque was a miss. Too strong and very salty."}
{"text":"The pastries were delicious but not sure why my latte tasted super gamey. I asked the waitress if it was goat milk and she said it was cow milk. I tried really hard to drink it to not waste money but I just couldn't because it tasted so gross. Giving 4 stars because of the pastries and loved the ambiance."}
{"text":"We wandered in for some breakfast after reading some good reviews of the place.
We had the breakfast special which consists of a hot beverage and orange juice with a pastry and a madeleine (which was kindly replaced by a macaron for my mother who does not eat gluten) as well as a pastry on the side. 
The tiramisu and coffee-cinnamon choux were very nice though not the best I ever had, I suppose I was expecting more from a MOF. The macaron was alright, but a special mention should be made for the maple laminated brioche which was lovely.
A bit pricey and overhyped but a pleasant experience. The place is a bit small and gets packed so maybe not the nicest for afternoon tea."}
{"text":"Oh my!! What can we say, from the impeccable service to the outstanding pastries we LOVED this place. It's definitely on our list of places to return to in Montreal."}
{"text":"Right near the Notre-Dame Basilica by the water is this cute and chic little pastry shoppe & cafe. We had the most delightful lunch here! 

The salmon sandwich is the best thing here -- comes with a poached egg and perfect smoked salmon with dill on a buttered (or mayoed?) bun. Their lobster & crab sandwich was good too, but I felt like the salmon was more satisfying. 

They show you a dessert tray for you to choose -- I chose a passion fruit & raspberry tart which was delicious. 

Also got a box of macarons to go! 

LOVED the lighting in this cafe and the simple decor. Huge ceiling-to-floor windows. Perfect for instagramming. 

Note: 
- Bathroom is on the 4th floor. 
- You pay at the front (even if you are dining in). 
- Macarons come in box of 6 or 12"}
{"text":"The pastries here are amazing... in fact, my wife (who is a connoisseur of cakes!!!) said the chocolate and almond croissant was the best she's had outside France :-)

Definitely a recommend - we loved it... :-)"}
{"text":"This patisserie was delicious with fresh OJ and nice croissants and Madeleine with jam. The apple turnover was very soft and crunchy but the Madeleine was a bit hard.. The raspberry tart was quite good but very sweet, a nice morning in a beautiful place though!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! Clean and bright.  The pastry display left me wide eyed in wonder. I had a fabulous hazelnut eclair.   The espresso was a delight. Will come back."}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was in the summer time, I could not even sit down and the staff was overwhelmed by the amount of people and an older staff member got a bit rude. 

I recently came back in the winter time however and had a great experience! 

We came for deserts and a warm beverage. Our server gave us our menu to chose our hot beverage and when we told him we wanted deserts he came over with the whole tray and explained to us every single tart and pastry we can chose from. And all the other customers upon seeing us marvel at the desert tray, advised the waiter to come to them after with the desert selection.

The tarts we got were so good my boyfriend started seeing little French pastry angle floating around him and ignored me in till he finished his first bite haha 

So moral of the story is, it's good, it's worth the wait, but if you want better service come when they are not as busy."}
{"text":"In NYC we are spoiled with several MoFs's pastry shops but no one comes close to Mr. Faure. He should really open up a shop in NYC. 

We had several pastries of which I will post photos but our favorite was the mille feuille.  Wow...custard heaven!  

If you are in Old Montreal, this pastry shop is a must.  Try the pastry of the day, mille feuille or an eclair...you will thank me later."}
{"text":"A dessert cost as much as a meal in Chinatown and for good reasons. The pastry is made by a top notch pastry maker with the best ingredients. The staffs were extremely friendly and they let you taste a couple of the samples. 

Great quality desserts and amazing customer service made this place a pleasure to visit. I have to try their brunch in the near future to give this place a five stars it possibly deserved!"}
{"text":"J'ai allé ce restaurant par-ce que il a été recommandé par Yelp. Les pâtisseries était super, et les café était bien. En général, ce n'est pas mal. Je vais revenir si je vais être dans le quartier.   

P.S. C'était très touristique."}
{"text":"I had the lobster and crab brioche. I was not very impressed. It lacked flavour and was pretty pricey for what it was. My husband had a chocolate croissant which is the better way to go. It was supper cheap, flavourful and satisfying. The waitress was nice but a bit inexperienced. Our water glasses were empty the entire meal and she did not check in on us for most of our visit. She mentioned only working there for a week so hopefully it gets better with time."}
{"text":"Mon petit paradis ! Un bon bout de France a Montreal, où je retrouve mes pâtisseries préférées. Excellentes, elles ne sont pas trop lourdes ni trop sucrées. Accompagnées souvent d'un vrai café ou un bon thé."}
{"text":"We were just going to pick up desserts but decided to eat and kind of regret that choice. Service was slow and I thought the food was good but not amazing. Limited brunch menu compared to their normal lunch menu. Just ok."}
{"text":"Came here after my work training. They open till 6 on weekdays so try to go during the day. When you enter they seat you down and asks if you've been there before and they take out a tray of their deserts and you get to choose at your seat. There's not too many seats also so plan ahead when you want to go. All in all a place to visit if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"The reviews are correct......great pastry shop! But, it's also a good place for lunch.....a limited menu, but really good..... as is their pastry. Love it. I'm back home, missing their croissants and other pastries."}
{"text":"Ditto to what Bryant N said...just go! 

Went here for a lunch work. What a cute little patissirie which also offers light lunch as well. The decor is all white against a cement statement wall which adds that extra je ne said quoi to the already fancy decor.

Your eyes will be hungry as soon as you walk in the door; gorgeous pastries all made in house (Chef Christian was there and happily obliging to photos with his fans :); I opted for Lobster and Crab puff pastry sandwich (it sounds much more fancy en Francais but I can't remember the name). Amazing. Whole lobster claw and crab meat in what seemed like a round croissant.

Even if you don't save some room for dessert you will make room once you see the dessert tray....sensory overload! I ordered a coffee crumble cake with lemon mousse and meringue. Totally worth the workout that came afterwards. 

Merci beaucoup, Chef Christian!"}
{"text":"Came in the afternoon for a treat with some hot chocolate. Picked this place based on high Yelp ratings. 

Staff bordered on rudeness at entrance and did not bother to greet even. Took a while before we were seated and given menus and even longer for someone to take orders. Eventually after we got our drinks and waitress came around with a pastry tray. We ordered and then watched as our pastries sat at a nearby table for 10 minutes before we had to ask someone to bring them over. This would have all been overlooked if the pastries were good but they were awful. We had the madeleines which were dry and hard and had to be dipped into drinks to make them edible. The rum baba (I think it was called), a round cake soaked in a syrup that was excessively sweet and tasted of uncooked rum was totally inedible, we were not even asked why this was not eaten. 

Will not be back. Much better on offer at chain bakeries on same street"}
{"text":"Perfect stop after a visit to the museum! I think I ate my way through Montreal today but still had room for an eclair and croissant with an iced cappuccino! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"As we were cruising the streets of Old Montreal heading back to the hotel, my wife decided to stop by given the plethora of Yelp reviews.  After a few days in Montreal, we were due to try some macarons and we were not disappointed.

The macarons are fresh, light and tasty.  There isn't much we can add other than saying they are excellent and you can't go wrong.  The shop is cozy, clean and service is great.  Things here are pricy but you get what you pay for.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Delicious pastries, especially the passion fruit raspberry tart. I really recommend it. Hot chocolate was the best I've ever had. Worth the money. 

Although, the service was not the best. Very slow service, took a very long time to bring the menu, then the choices, and instructions weren't so clear on the way we were supposed to pay. Usually, in restaurants, they bring the check to you but here, we had to get up to pay. We waited maybe 20 minutes for the check only to find out we had to go to the counter. In these kinds of situations, waiters should be more clear because we don't like wasting time."}
{"text":"I actually wanna give them 1 star for being so unbelievably good yet not being in my hometown atlanta. I guess that isn't fair so a 5 star is due for their out of this world culinary dessert marvels.

I'm not a dessert fanatic but this place can give a diabetic reason to forgo their sugar intake check. 

I can hardly recommend anything. We literally tried 6 items and each was just unique and great in its own. The building houses two floors of pastry school right on top of this beautiful restaurant.

To make it even sweeter the staff is just very humble. It's better to go in between meal times as it can get super busy. We went in accidentally after lunch and were seated right away. Of course deciding which dessert to order was probably more difficult than learning to fly a plane. 

But just to throw out some recommendations the chocolate almond croissant is probably the best I've ever had. Of course don't even think about leaving without trying their raspberry tart. Don't know how they made it but it's cold like sorbet in the center yet the tart shell and cream on top blends the whole dessert so beautifully. 

They have a wide variety of food items too but unfortunately we could only savor their desserts and coffees. 

So which ever restaurant you dine at just remember to skip dessert and rush to this sweet heaven."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch place!! Highly recommend the traditional chicken club sandwich - comes with a generous side of chips. It was the best cold sandwich I've ever had.  The macarons are delicious as well.  I got mango-passion fruit, salted caramel, and praline - all were delicious.

Service was friendly, and there was a slight lunchtime wait (because the restaurant's seating area is so small), but the staff turned tables over pretty quickly.  The staff here truly pay attention to detail and are so meticulous and careful in the arrangement of their pastry case.  I wish I got extra pastries and macarons to go!"}
{"text":"Delicious chocolate croissant and passion tart.  Very nice breakfast spot. Lots of pastries, desserts and coffee to pick from."}
{"text":"\"Is an update really necessary since you still really love this bakery?\" you might ask. And to that, I say \"yes!\" I need to update my review as I went here recently with friends and my 1 year-old who was undoubtedly over-tired started crying incessantly just as we were seated to eat in the crowded lunch room. After I was unsuccessful in trying to pacify her, the owner of the bakery came over. I tensed up thinking that he was coming over to unceremoniously shoo me out of his posh restaurant or worse yet to ask me to make my child stop screaming (for everyone out there who believes that parents enjoy hearing our children screaming, please know that while it is annoying to you, it is 100% worse for us to hear our children cry. But I digress!). Much to my surprise, instead of admonishing me for bringing a crying baby into his restaurant, he greeted me with a huge and understanding smile and invited us up the 2nd floor where Maison Christian Faure has a cooking school (which was not in session at that moment) where there was a large, quiet and warm space where my daughter could nap or run around until she was ready to come back to the table. It turned out to be the perfect solution. It was really such a nice touch! When I apologized for my baby's crying and for disturbing everyone trying to enjoy their lunches, he said, ''don't be silly, we parents need to stick together; kids are so challenging!\" He was really so very sweet! Just when I thought I could not love this bakery anymore, I fell deeper in love with it.

N.B. - It is worth coming here during the winter months as I did not realize until recently that they do not make their fabulous \"Mont Blanc\" during the summer and fall months. If there was ever a good reason to visit Montreal in winter (and let's be honest with ourselves, there are so few good reasons), then that is it!"}
{"text":"This is a gem in the heart of Old Montreal, best french pastries outside of France! they don't take reservations, we arrived at 10am and waited for 45 minutes for a seat but it was worth it. We had the brunch menu, then desert. It was incredible! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries, beautifully decorated. The man at the counter was so helpful and kind! Delicious and decadent. I love the eclair, everything was wonderful. I am so impressed with this wonderful bakery."}
{"text":"L'une des meilleures pâtisseries à Montréal. Du haut de gamme."}
{"text":"Que ce soit pour le déjeuner, le brunch, le dîner, ou tout simplement pour ramener quelque chose de bon à la maison, je vous recommande fortement l'endroit.

J'y suis allée pour un brunch la fin de semaine et j'ai beaucoup aimé mon expérience! Le service était courtois, sympathique et pas du tout guindé. Pour ce qui est de ce que nous avons mangé cette journée là, tout était vraiment excellent. Bien que je n'ai pas commandé de viennoiserie, les (petites) bouchées que j'ai réussi à voler m'ont tout simplement donné envie d'y revenir! Les croissants n'étaient ni trop lourds, ni trop secs. Juste parfaits! Pour ce qui est des gâteaux, oubliez le régime le temps de vous arrêter ici: ils valent chacune des calories qu'ils contiennent! ;)"}
{"text":"Such a cute place, with good food, and it smells delicious.  
The have a lunch special which includes the daily special, coffee and a pastry...all for $23. Not bad, unless the special doesn't interest you. That was my case! 

I ended up getting the quiche which came with a small  (actually tiny) salad. The quiche had ham and bacon and was one of the best I had. Fluffy egg, flaky crust (not at all burnt), and well seasoned.  Got the Cappuccino which was very small for $4.50. That said, with the addition of sugar it was very tasty. I opted for a dessert which was a almond cake with an apricot mousse on top, really good. My bill was $26.90...$3.90 more than the special (no biggie). 

Anyway, the lunch menu isn't large, but this place is well worth the visit. I'm sure you'll find an entree, and guarantee you'll find a tasty pastry. You'll even find retail items for purchase (spreads, marshmallows, ice cream). 

FYI- the bathroom is on the 4th floor."}
{"text":"Great dessert and brunch place! We tried many desserts and croissants. Dominique Ansel of Canada! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Macaroons were exquisitely delicious. My favorite was the caramel, but each of my friends had their own favorites (I think one liked the pistachio and the other the praline). We also bought a chocolate cake for my friend's birthday-- the chocolate was too rich for my liking though."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to visit in Montreal. Casual atmosphere. A little bit on the pricey side, but the food is worth the money."}
{"text":"I was sceptical reading so many rave reviews for this place. However after having one of their almond crossisants I will say it was the best pastry I've ever eaten. If you are in Montreal you must eat here. I stopped in right as they opened at 8am and was one of only 3 people there."}
{"text":"Great quality brunch. Albeit a bit pricey for what you get. If you stop in, i would suggest just getting the croissant and a coffee. The bakery is the first floor of christian faure pastry school. Our server was Christian Faure son. The service is slow but i think its because us american's are in and out."}
{"text":"Truly great cafe au lait when paired with A chocolate croissant.  Great atmosphere to relax from sightseeing."}
{"text":"Pros: Variety of delicious French pastries, Nice interior, Authentic 
Cons: Most of it is gone at the end of the day (obviously), 


-Ambiance- 
Located away from the main action in Old Port , it offers a nice breather from all those tourists. Very nice shop that gives you that clean&fresh feeling; the decor and the pastries together sets you up for a pleasant visit. Everything behind glass is usually good and this was no exception. The service is kind and attentive but also relax in a sense where they don't annoy you constantly while you're stuffing your face. For pastries and drinks prices range from 3-13$. For real food it would be more (but why would you even?). 

-Food- 

Pot de Fleur de Sel Caramel : Salted caramel mousse on top of a chocolate brownie/cake? inside a cute glass pot. For me it was a different taste than what I was used to: more authentic than previous salted caramel treats that I've tried. It was not very sweet and the brownie added texture and more flavours to the whole dessert.  It ended up being one of my favourites. 

Strawberry Cake: The tartness of the strawberry balanced out the sweetness of the other components creating a solid, delicious piece of cake. 

Pistachio cake with fruits: For me it was like a pistachio cake with fruit cake on top that worked WELL together. It was light and pleasant. 

Lemon Meringue : It was  too sweet for my tastes as there was a layer of white chocolate under the filling. Good surprise for some but not for me, as I am adamant about my dislike for white chocolate. In this case, I dealt with it because I had tea and it did cut the acidity of the lemon filing.  The pastry was a bit hard for spoon handling, but we all have fingers- suck it up. 

-Overall- 
A nice place to stop and relax in the Old Port to enjoy a coffee or tea accompanied by pretty&tasty desserts. Not mind-blowing but a must go!"}
{"text":"Every pastry looked all decadent! And I'm sure they are!  Like many shops in Old Montreal, it's like stepping into Paris. Charming and quaint.

Very friendly and helpful staff that speaks English. I recommend this place when you're in Montreal.  Well worth it.  Just looking at the beautiful, delicious creations is a sight to see!  The photos I've posted gives you an idea of what I mean.

I love it here!  Even if it's my first time....I'll make sure to return many more!"}
{"text":"I was walking around Old Montreal when I saw a family breaking into a box of the most delicious looking baked goods while sitting outside. I was just about to ask them where they got them when I looked a little past them and saw the sign for Maison Christian Faure. I made an IMMEDIATE bee-line for the door. 

When I walked in I knew I was gonna love the place. Beautiful, intricate sugar sculptures were showcased around cases of the most magical looking tarts, pastries, croissants, etc. I was overwhelmed. I wanted it all! 

I picked up a few packaged sugar cookies to take home to my husband and mom (they also love a good bakery) and made a line for the case. I will agree with a few reviewers that stated that it was a bit confusing at first but the staff was helpful and let me roll with the change in venue (I was originally going to take it to go but realized it would be easier to eat in). Typically one sits down at a table and they bring you a menu as well as a tray of the day's cakes and such. I kind of wish I had gone this route, so they could have told me what each treat was, but I just picked one from the case and they delivered it to me at the table, along with my cookies nicely packaged in a bag to go.

The tart I selected was the passion fruit, mango tart with caramel. I sent my mom a pictured with the caption \"It's so good I almost cried.\" She responded, \"so emotional.\" I said, \"I get very emotional over baked goods.\" Which is true! I can't get enough of a delicious treat. It's like, next level happiness to me. So here I was. Enjoying an incredible french sweet and living my Parisian bakery dream. 

Regrets? I have many. That I didn't come back every day I was here? That I didn't' get more to go? That I didn't get a blasted croissant? Don't make my mistakes. Get everything. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"LOVE!!!
I make sure to stop here when I'm in Montreal. Love their club sandwich and make sure to take some pastries to go. The service is a wee bit slow when you're seated to eat-in but that doesn't take away from the amazing, fresh food they have. Love this place. I am a big fan."}
{"text":"Pastries were great. The owner is a French pastry chef and you can tell by the quality and presentation.  The espresso was smooth and creamy with mild finish.  Very chic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Pure and simple. I fell in love with this artisan Montreal jewel a short while ago after tasting their chocolate cake. Piece of heaven! (Add a touch of Itzhak Perlman playing, and that would be heaven). I've also tried their macaroons. It's no Parisian Pierre Herme, but it's tasty. The staff are great. They try to make you enjoy your experience there, even when you speak little or no French. It's definitely a must-try. The world needs more tasty glimpses of heaven like this."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks promising when you walk in - the decor is fresh and the pastries smell good. 

I got the \"brunch on a plank\" and was really not impressed. It came with french toast that was not even warm and the eggs benedict came on a dry flavourless puff pastry instead of the standard english muffin. The eggs were also served with some sort of bechemel foam - moving away from the traditional creamy sauce but probably not with good reason. The saving grace of the dish was the fresh fruit and caramel sauce that came with it. 

I had been here before and was quite happy with what I had ordered by the brunch the second time was really average. Maybe it was an off day with the kitchen the second time I went in. 

Maybe I'll give them a 3rd shot - the seating in charming and it's in a lovely part of the city. Not sure yet though!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

*Don't go for brunch, go for the pastries and dessert. 
*Brunch is overpriced or the portion isn't justifiable for the price. 
*The bakery compasses a baking school, workshops. 
*The chef is a MOF - Meilleur Ouvrier de France - meaning he has been tested at the highest level for his baking skills. 
*The shop is small and cute. Tables are a bit too close together, can get uncomfortable. 
*Don't come here and expect excellent service. 

-Lobster and Royal Crab served in a choux pastry - $18
The choux pastry was so dry and chewy that I didn't finish it, thus I was quite disappointed to see that a French bakery would fail to make a choux pastry.. With that said, there were good chunks of lobster and crab meat, and the light mayonnaise didn't overpower the delicate seafood and still let their natural sweetness come through.

-Brunch on the plank  - $20
 it was such a small portion for $20. I didn't try the egg benedict since it was tiny - but friend said it was good, and the brioche was delicious and decadent. However I thought I could have gotten something more substantial with that price point.

-Traditional mille-feuille - $6
The name of mille-feuille translates into a \"thousand sheets\" - which refer to the layers of the puff pastry. All I have to say is that this mille-feuille was heavenly! Crisp, crunchy buttery layers of puff pastry that crackle when you bite into them. The slight glaze on the first layer of the pastry gave that hint of sweetness. Alternated with a velvety smooth pastry cream. The perfect combination and contrast between crunch and silky smooth. Buttery and sweet.

-Chocolate eclair - $6
The pastry was light and airy, filled with a rich and luscious chocolate cream. Seriously, is there anything better than the mildly sweet, rich, and chocolaty goodness of an eclair? If you are a dark chocolate lover, you will definitely enjoy this pastry. However for myself, I wished there was another flavor in the pastry cream to complement the rich chocolate."}
{"text":"I'm a dessert person. Will choose dessert over main course any time. I stopped by after lunch at Olive et Gourmando. The almond croissant here is flakier and richer than O&G (no comparison). I also had the maple brioche. However, my absolute favorite is chocolate croissant which is sold on weekends only. It's chocolate swirl around the croissant with a bar of chocolate inside...highly recommended.  Light, flaky, chocolaty and not too rich. Yum!"}
{"text":"A really pretty and cute cafe! We weren't able to stay though, so we took a bunch of desserts to go, and the box was super adorable.

Anyways, everything was pretty much as delicious as it looks. My favorite would be the passion fruit tart, strawberry cake, and Mille fuielle. 

There was one miss though - not sure what it was called, but it was small and circular and taller. It had the texture of an eraser.

The desserts here are also on the pricier side - you're paying for the ambience and decor as well. I'd say it's all worth it though"}
{"text":"Quaint little place packed with locals. Simple club sandwich was out out of this world good. Followed by a hazelnut éclair and perfect start to the afternoon."}
{"text":"Pros: pastries were great and packaged nicely, clean, nice atmosphere 

Cons: very expensive"}
{"text":"If I die and go to pastry heaven this will be it. We shared the paris breast eclair and the passion fruit and raspberry tart. Both amazingly light yet memorable. I could sit here all day and eat everything they make."}
{"text":"This place...O.M.G. Went in for a quick sugar fix during a conference break. It was crowded but there was still ample seating. We were in and out in less than 5 minutes with 2 delicious pastries in hand (cost was $14.95). We ordered 1 black currant jam pastry. Not my favorite as the base was very hard, although my friend liked it the best. We also ordered an almond apricot pastry, which was divine. Definitely a must while visiting the old town!"}
{"text":"It was okay. There wasn't much of a meat menu (good for vegetarians though). The pastries were pretty, and the macaroons were AMAZING, but I don't think the lunch was worth the price. It was great for pictures though. I had the lobster (they said it was the best seller), but I've had better lobster in Maine."}
{"text":"One of the best French pastries in Montreal. This is no ordinary dessert pastry place. The products are of highest quality ingredients with work of a great pastry chef Christian Faure. 
I have been here several times, for breakfast and afternoon tea. Every visit was memorable. 
Price is on high side but reasonable for the quality of pastries you get. Average price per pastry is about CAN $7 It's hard to find serious high end quality pastries and I did search high and low. 
Ambiance is always classy, small and cozy. Not sure it's suitable for group. 
The minor improvement they can do is to put name tags on all the pastries so that customers don't have to guess or ask every single time they want to know what each pastry is made of."}
{"text":"Best pastry shop in the old Montreal stretch. Small intimate setting is good for a breakfast coffee date with your honey. Almond croissants and the brioches we're my favorites.  Other sweet treats are perfect for gifts. Didn't get a chance to try everything. Their hand crafted mashmellows were simply heavenly. Raspberry marshmallows. Delicious and light."}
{"text":"Here's heaven: 
The Germans - organize everything.
The Italians- in charge of entertainment.
The Dutch - finance the whole affair.
The French - caterers in eternity.

Christian Faure is why the French will be pastry chefs in heaven. Faure ever!

Everything at CF is stellar: from the pillowy raspberry marshmallow squares to the lemon sherbet, tarts, eclairs, caneles, all are of transcendent quality. 

I'm getting up early to go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. We were only in for a short moment getting macaroons but the aromas in the store were out of this world. Everything in the displays looked mouth watering. We got a box of I believe 12 macaroons, which was 35 Canadian. Not too cheap but it was well worth the price, trust me. We scarfed those down so quick. The shop itself was very clean and looked like a nice little place that you could have a coffee or hot chocolate in as well. Staff was very nice and helpful and made my experience there worthwhile and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very nice but extremely crowded so could not get seat; had a croissant to go but would of liked less rushing and being rushed but display was beautiful...will return during week"}
{"text":"Lovely and beautiful pastries. Staff was very warm, friendly, and patient. Would highly recommend. Very clean !"}
{"text":"This place located in the heart of Old Montreal and right by the water. Very limited seating, however they turn the table in timely manner.

They do have good pastries and decent coffee. They use illy for their beans.

It's a good place for lunch and late afternoon tea/coffee time with desserts."}
{"text":"Maison Christian Faure is a must visit while in Montreal. The pastry shop will arouse your taste buds. Reward yourself, and visit Maison Christian Faure."}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch options with solid pastries

Ambience/Service:  This restaurant is adorable, with a trendy, modern display case of beautiful macarons and pastries as you enter and a small area for seating next to an old stone wall and sun pouring through the front windows.  Everyone in the store was extremely helpful and service was outstanding.

Food:  We originally came for the pastries but ended up being intrigued by their lunch options.  I'm vegetarian and got the fresh goat cheese and beet puff pastry.  My girlfriend got a seared scallop puff pastry.  These took a bit of time to prepare but our lovely waitress told us so and said they were going to bring us an amuse bouche to tie us over, which was a house-made pate (a pretty popular dish in Montreal) with a small amount of pie(?) crust on its outside.  My girlfriend really enjoyed it.  As we waited, I saw what seemed to be a gorgeous macaron plate being assembled back in the kitchen.  I distinctly told my girlfriend - man, I wish I was getting that plate.  It turns out it was my goat cheese and beet puff pastry with a savory macaron in it.  It was arguably the most beautiful plate of food I've had in my life.  It tasted just as good as it looked.  Subtle goat cheese.  Perfectly roasted beets.  Perfectly cooked puff pastry.  Asparagus, dill.  Just beautifully balanced.  My girlfriend said her scallops were seared to perfection, seasoned well, and was delicious as well.  We also got a Paris-Brest eclair and another pastry recommended by our waitress (a vanilla/rum baked good, don't remember the name).  It was well executed but far too strong a taste for me.  Cappucino and latte rounded out the meal.  It was not cheap but it was absolutely worth it.
*UPDATE: we came back (I couldn't resist) and got a lemon tart and an almond croissant.  I'm surprised to say that we didn't really enjoy the pastries. The almond croissant had a similarly alcoholic flavor to it which I did not want in the morning.  The lemon tart was a touch too lemon-y.  I still think this place is 5 stars for the lunch options.

Overall:  I wanted to come back to this restaurant every morning but resisted the urge to try other places.  I think I would have enjoyed eating here every day we were in Montreal.  DO NOT pass up this place when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Looking for an early lunch/late breakfast and found this place using Yelp.  It was wonderful.  Not only are the pastries out of this world, but the lunch was excellent.  I got the chicken club, based on another review I read and it was great.  Good spot to grab a nice lunch and probably the best pastries in Montreal."}
{"text":"A cute chic cafe in the heart of Old Montreal right off of Rue Saint Paul perfect for afternoon tea or a lunch date.  The desserts are beautiful and aren't too sweet.  The decor is modern, feminine, and charming.  There were lots of locals including ladies who lunch, chic yuppies, and romantic couples.  We tried the pistachio cake and the berry galette with an iced cappuccino.  Both were delicious!  They also serve lunch here if you're looking for something more substantial."}
{"text":"The food is good but I had a bad experience. I wanted an almond croissant. They were out so I ordered a plain. I got one (to go) and was mistakingly charged for two. I returned the next afternoon to point out the error. The manager was quick to offer a refund. I explained I would rather try their almond croissant and pay any additional charge. However they were all out. I said I would return the next morning. When I did they were all out of almond croissants even though it was just a few minutes after 10:00. Three times I tried and three times they were sold out before 10:00. Why not make more? They offered to refund the mistaken charge (2.50) but I said I'd take a plain croissant instead. Three trips to the shop and I didn't get to try an almond croissant. I am grateful that they made up for their mistake at the cash register. My rating reflects my experience, not their food, which is better than the rating"}
{"text":"Amazing place! All the deserts and even the coffee was amazing. The people are super nice and friendly. Love this place"}
{"text":"Fruit tarts. Fruit tarts. Fruit tarts. Fruit tarts. Fruit tarts. Fruit tarts. Fruit tarts. Fruit tarts. Fruit tarts. Fruit tarts. Fruit tarts. Fruit tarts."}
{"text":"This little patisserie in Vieux-Montréal has tasty treats and a charming ambiance. I stopped by near closing time, and the tables were all cleaned off, so I just had to get my food to go. I got three macarons, and they were delicious - amazing flavor and the perfect chewy/crispy texture. Check it out yourself if you're craving some fine baked goods."}
{"text":"I love this place! The restaurant is very clean with some good-looking desserts behind their glass counters. I bought the framboise marshmallows to bring home to the States and share with my family. They packaged it well 'cause the softness lasted for two days. They were interesting with a right amount of sweetness packaged into each pink block. I also had one of their other desserts as part of our dine-in experience which was AMAZING! If I wasn't so full, I would have tried more desserts. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent bakery and had THE most amazing quiche for lunch. The chocolate croissant and almond chocolate croissants were the best we had in the city. The cappuccino was very good also. We went on a Sunday around 11:30 and there was a pretty big line to get a table. It was a little confusing to know whether the line was for a table or take-out. It appeared to be for both, which was odd if you just wanted to get something to go. We wanted to sit, so it didn't impact us, but for people just wanting take-out, it might have been frustrating to have to stand in line so long. The service was friendly, although a bit slow as they only had what appeared to be one waiter for the whole area, with one other helping him out. But, if you have a few hours to spare and you want deliciously fresh food, don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Come early for the almond croissant, they run out quick. 

The strawberry shortcake is a little too sweet for me even though I received the recommendation that it is the least sweet among all the pastries in the tray. Chocolate croissant was fluffy and had an interesting texture."}
{"text":"Service: 2/5 stars. Our server was extremely friendly but it was painfully clear that their staff could not keep up w/ the amount of patrons. Perhaps they have too many duties? The lady behind the pastries counter was also very nice and explained what the pastries were made with but I felt bad that I was taking up her time as I could feel the glances of the other patrons. So yeah, don't come here if you're ever in a rush. I saw one old gentleman give his order to the server as he was being sat down. Seems like he knows what needs to be done.
** Our poor server was running around so much that we got up and ordered our pastries to-go straight from the counter after our meal. Seems as though from the other reviews that they come to your table w/ a tray to explain them to you? 

Food: Best almond croissant ever. Ever. Also solid butter croissant. Tried 2 of their pastries and thought they were pretty good. There was one that was rectangular in shape and strawberry flavored and the topping tasted like Marshmallow fluff (bleh). I had a pastry that had the word \"soliel\" in it which had vanilla creme on top and pears as the filling. Awesome shortbread crust. The mochaccino and latte were also ok. Macarons were also some of the best I've ever had. Fillings were super strong except the pistachio. 

Overall the pastries were good but next time I'd probably take it to go and sit outside in the nearby park by the water. I have no idea how to rate this overall. 3.5 but bumped to a 4 for the food."}
{"text":"We were here for a Yelp event and I am so glad I got to participate
I've been here before but only walked in and out quickly because I didn't have time but was completely in awe with the place and the beautiful pastries and chocolates on display.
We got to try quite a large selection of delicious sweets. I prefered some to others but that is definitely according to personal taste and not to the quality of the pastires themselves. 
Wow!!!!!
My fav were the Montblanc, the passionfruit tart and the chocolate mousse cake, I tried a lot of different ones and those stood out the most in term of balance between sweet, tangy and bitter
This is such a great place for a lunch/dessert/coffee date or just-bring-your-mom-on-a-sunday-and-talk-about-aunt-Daisy's-new-beau kind of thing. 
Before leaving, I even bought a bunch pf my favs to go because I couldn't resist sharing these lil gems w my friends"}
{"text":"Very good lunch. Both the special and the quiche are highly recommended. Make sure to take some if the fancy patisserie home for a snack later."}
{"text":"Great service 
Amazing pastries (the platter selection comes to your table if you're dining in) 
Mille feuille was the best I've had, ever (even in Paris). 

Typical parisien patisserie ambiance 

Honored to be in presence of a MOF chef and we can't wait to go back to try the tarts!"}
{"text":"Being a macaron snob and this is probably the only time I will ever use the word snob when it comes to food, I definitely have my favorites and have traveled wide and far (ok, fine -- furthest is LA) to seek out the best. So I like to say I have some experience when knowing which macaron place has the best. So far, Toute de Sweet near me in Bethesda and Laduree have been on the top for me. 

I like to compare this place a bit like Laduree but on a smaller scale. When walking in, it definitely had that Parisian cutesy decor and all the patisseries were too cute. However, the macaron selections did look a bit lacking and we only had a few to choose from. I grabbed a box of 15 and hit the road for our long drive back to MD. 

I didn't try these until later that night and although they were good, it lacked that chewy factor.  But, the next day, I tried them again and the chewy factor came into play, which reminded me of Laduree a bit. Macarons done right should be eaten within few days in the fridge because the shell will crack when bitten into. You can also let it thaw a bit from the cold before eating, but really, who has time for that. 

This place was pretty pricey considering the lack of selections so I definitely would prefer Laduree over this place. But hey, if you're in old Montreal, feel free to stop by and give it a try. Had we known that this place served food as well, we would've loved to try it for brunch."}
{"text":"How did I not hear of this shop. I am not usually a dessert over meal kind of a person, but this pastry shop could change that notion right quick.

\"Par excellence\" with a bunch of other \"Haute de gamme\" high-end French expressions come to mind when describing this boutique in Old Montreal (they also have a Downtown location - for more access to decadence).

I read Chef Christian Faure's bio (numerous awards and accolades) and was more than impressed. It's sweetly obvious this gentleman knows pastry. They even have a school teaching others to create the ultimate goodies. I mean who wouldn't want to have a means to make tasty treats like they offer in your own home.

Let's just say that in most cases I stick up for value and over priced items, but we'll give the $3 each Macarons a price pass this time. The exquisite factor more than makes up for it. It's like magic taste wand.

The box comes with a neat printed paper belt which also distinguishes their Macarons from any run-of-the-mill-wannabe-delicious-treats.

They were a huge hit, and disappeared as fast as you could say ... not-your-average-everyday-run-of-the-mill-wannabe-delicious-treats.

Side note: The staff where in no way pretentious, as I thought hmm, this is definitely the kind of place where you may expect to find pinky fingers pointing upwards. That not being my experience at the counter. I was pleased with the courtesy of the staff. Keep that up. Merci bien."}
{"text":"Went there with my sweet friend... We ordered strawberry shortcake, and milk pudding. For drink we had rose lemonade and hot chocolate. Everything was just on the point! The desserts were so flavorful and neither too sweet nor too greasy. Hot chocolate was pure and of high quality. Rose lemonade was so unique and refreshing. What a wonderful afternoon tea! I'll Denifitelty go back again!"}
{"text":"If you want an authentic French pastry and Illy coffee, come here!!! This place is fantastic!!!

The restaurant is owned by a chef who was named the best pastry chef in the world. You will soon find it why! 

I had the chocolate almond croissant. It was the best croissant I have ever had!

My husband had the chocolate croissant and it was flaky, yummy, perfection.

There is really not a bad thing in this place!"}
{"text":"Go there.  That's my advice.  The pastries are out of this world...as is the coffee and the general ambiance.  Once we discovered this cute little pastry shop/cafe, we went back every chance we had.  I only had the Palmiers, but my friend tried a couple of different things.  She loved them all."}
{"text":"No,No,No.....cakes were ok not bad, but it was not awesome.
 My iced late was warm and disgusting !!?No ice cube in my glass?
Our waitress said some thing about my latte, like they made it wrong or something....
so why don't you make it again and fix it !!! I'll never ever go back there again and not recommend it at all. You can find so many better places than there. I want my money back !"}
{"text":"Great spot for sampling the best pastries and croissants in Montreal. The staff is super friendly and attentive. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Service was outstanding. Pastry was perfect - we had the almond croissants and macaroons. Coffee was also very good. Cafe is small but comfortable with great light. Nicely located in old Montreal and a great place to stop for breakfast, lunch or snack. Will definitely make this a planned stop next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Surrounded by art galleries, restaurants, and cobblestone streets, Maison Christian Faure is a delightful place to refuel during a long day visiting Old Montreal. 
My girlfriend and I visited around 1pm on a Saturday, and although it was busy, the staff was very accommodating and quickly seated us and served our pastries and beverages. We had chocolate raspberry framboisette, a raspberry mouse pastry, and mogador, a dessert with layers of chocolate mouse, raspberry filling, and ganache. Framboisette was light, delicious, with well-balanced flavor and mogador was rich, chocolate, and overall slightly heavier. We would absolutely order these again.
The staff was very attentive and accommodating for two English-speaking travelers. 
Pro tip: If dining in, don't worry about selecting your pastry from the display. The knowledgeable staff will bring a tray to your table and explain each one."}
{"text":"went here to try their croissants...although they were good i think they could have been better. their pastry selection is another story however. i got a pastry with mango on top...forgot what it was called but they described it as creme brulee at the bottom and mango on top. it was delicious and creamy! cost ~9"}
{"text":"4.5

O.M.G this place is amazing to put simply. 

I've tried a variety of the desserts from here and each one of them is so well crafted...and tastes amazing too. 

Situated in old Montreal is Maison Christian Faure, a contemporary dessert spot with a rustic flare. Located inside a classic building is the bakery/dessert spot. Immediately upon entering you are welcomed by the aroma of amazing baked goods...

I went closer to closing and they still had a good selection of desserts - croissants, eclairs, macarons and more! I opted for takeout though they have ample seating all around. 

The desserts are absolutely incredible - crafted so delicately and taste amazing. The macarons here are...AMAZING. I've made macarons and have eaten macarons at many places...and really the macarons here are amazing. 

The eclair here was also quite good I have to say. Loses half a star from me because it is quite pricey...however I definitely recommend trying when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Perfect, we missed the breakfast time but still wanted to try everything on the lunch menu. If I come back to visit Montreal I will definitely stop by again.."}
{"text":"Incredible patisserie! My brunch yesterday was delicious. I shared chocolate almond croissant, french toast with a caramel syrup, fresh squeezed orange juice. We couldn't resist taking macaroons and pastries home to NYC with us. Everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"Mon dieu that was delicious pastry!

As someone who loves sweets I have been dying to try Maison Christian Faure, a pastry shop in Old Montreal.  Christian Faure is a meilleur ouvrier de France so how could his pastries not be wonderful?  Well the opportunity to visit this fine establishment finally presented itself so I jumped at it.

The shop is pretty large and it feels kind of sparse.  That being said there was some soft music in the background which helped give it some ambiance. It also helps that it is filled with aromas of fresh-baked pastries.  You have the option to sit down and order food or take something to go.  In addition to pastries they also serve main meals and sandwiches.  There is also a variety of sweets like marshmallows available for purchase.  

Now I was in need of lunch so I ordered a quinoa salad which I enjoyed very much.  It was very refreshing and I still had plenty of room for dessert, because coming here and not getting one would be sacrilege.  All the pastries look so tempting but I finally decided on a chocolate mousse with raspberry topping.  It was so elegantly prepared that I was almost scared to eat it.  Doing that though would have denied me a wonderful experience.  The mousse was airy and the flavours were very well balanced.  I was very happy with my choice.

The price tag is a little steep.  A pastry runs for $8.50 and my lunch came to about $32 before tip.  Once in a while it's fun to treat yourself to an experience like this but I couldn't see myself coming here all the time because it would add up pretty quickly.

For the most part service is attentive and friendly.  I was seated very quickly and the waitress knew the menu very well and was able to describe all the dessert items in detail.  My food came quickly.  The only minor hiccup I had was that it was difficult to get refills on my water.

If you're a sweet tooth then you must come here.  While the main dishes are pretty good the main attraction is the pastries which are some of the best in the city.  Their creations are bound to satisfy even the most discerning palate."}
{"text":"A cute French pastry shop in old Montreal. Good place for breakfast, afternoon tea, lunch or brunch. They have quite a good variety of pastries and it's their specialty so definitely give them a try if you stop by there."}
{"text":"While the hot chocolate and mocchachino were some of the best we've ever had, their prices to dine in are $1.25+ more expensive per item than it is to take out. 

We ordered a hot chocolate, 3 macaroons, a pastry, and a mocchachino and it came out to $30. What on earth?

They should actually ADVERTISE that dining in will be 25-30% more expensive than it is to take out. 

The macarons and Mille fueille were sub par at best. But seriously the hot chocolate was amazing."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves 5 stars. It's a great place to have a cup of latte and escape cold Montreal weather in October. Their eclairs are to die for and the quality of their cakes and pastries is superb. Just look at the pics and you'll understand what I'm talking about. Surely, you owe yourself a visit here after visiting Notre-Dame Basilica. Maison is a great place to unwind, have a cup of coffee or tea together with one of their amazing pastries or cakes."}
{"text":"Excellent place to take brunch, excellent food and the service is pretty nice and welcoming ."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible French pastries and desserts. They look like edible works of art. Very beautiful cafe and friendly service. It's a little pricey but well worth it. Treat yourself and go here!"}
{"text":"A wonderful gourmet pastry & coffee shop serving delectable tarts, croissants and assorted cake. Spacious and modern designed dining area is a good contrast to traditional storefront by the Old Port promenade. This is a must stop for those who love excellent bakery shop by a gourmet chef."}
{"text":"Everything in the bakery looked delicious!  I picked up a passion fruit raspberry tart and 2 macarons - pistachio and passion fruit mango.  The macarons were overpriced at $2.50 each, but the tart was good and reasonably priced at $4.50."}
{"text":"Nice bakery, pleasant & helpful staff, we had lunch while in town, ordered salads which were good...not spectacular but still good. We live only two hours away so it was easy to bring a few desserts home to keep the trip alive for a few more hours!  :)  Had the puff pastry with buttercream this afternoon, very good...the salted caramel pots with espresso brownie is waiting to be devoured this evening!  Definitely overpriced, $45 for 4 small desserts and 2 coffees...but what the hell, it's a vacation"}
{"text":"This place was pointed out to us while on a food tour with Local Montreal Food Tour and I'm so glad it was. I've never been to Paris but this is what I picture a bakery cafe would be like. It was busy and obviously very popular but the gentleman behind the counter was apologetic for the wait, which surprised us! Got the macarons -- perfection, best I've had. Pricey, but to be expected. A must when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Wow! The croissants were so good. We tried a plain, a pain au chocolate, and an almond as well. Each was perfection, with the almond out of the ordinarily light. The space is fashionable and bright. A great spot for a morning breakfast. Will visit again whenever we return to beautiful Montreal.

Merci!"}
{"text":"Only had the macaroons, they were very yummy! And everything else looks like pictures in a cuisine magazine."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best pastry shop I've ever been to.  It fulfills everything you imagine a pastry shop to be - the parts that should be crisp are crisp, the parts that are smooth are smooth and the parts that are fruity burst with flavor.  Perfect execution across the board, friendly service and a must-stop.  Montreal, or any city really, would do well to encourage more places like this to exist."}
{"text":"Everything is tasty and made with love , except croissants they are too heavy feels like you are biting a loaf of bread , croissant should  be light when you bite in to a croissant you should feel air pockets,  other than that it's a excellent bakery .oooooo wait :))))
If you are going to this bakery most probably you will get a parking ticket because there is  absolutely nowhere to park , because there is a construction  on there street I hope they will resolve this issue soon."}
{"text":"This famous pastry shop in Old Port has been on my Bucketlist for a very long time and I almost visited the place during a Yelp Elite event but I couldn't make it finally. I went to Tommy St-Paul and spotted Maison Christian Faure just around the corner, so I thought that fate brought me here and I really need to try. The pastry chef Christian Faure is very well known for his delicate desserts that look as good as they taste, that's why people simply love this place. Since it was 26 degrees outside yesterday, me and my friend decided to take two pieces of cake to go so that we can picnic on the lawn of old port. We both chose fruity flavours: my friend took passion fruit tart while I took the mango crème brûlée, they were soooo pretty! We couldn't take our eyes off them. If you want to enjoy the pastry indoor, the dining space inside the shop is nice and chic, a bit too simplistic compared to some elaborate restaurants around the area but good enough. When we left the shop and went next to the fountain of old port, we opened the box and took a bite: and it was heaven! The ingredients were fresh and the taste so well-balanced! The freshness of tropical fruit took away partially our heat and made our hearts flourish. I really liked it but found it a bit overpriced and the service was a bit slow, but I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This little shop/café/restaurant is so cute and cozy and the food is awesome! I was a tad thrown off when I walked in because I was expecting a small café-type shop, but it was a weird mix of a shop on the left, a kitchen/pastry school underneath, a patisserie in the middle and restaurant seating on the right where they serve you actual lunch and breakfast foods, not just dessert. It was designed really well though, I liked it.

Anyway, we sat in the restaurant area and ordered chocolat chaud (best I've had in Canada to date), regular coffee (didn't try, but was told it was very good) and shared a croustillant de pralin. The little chocolate pastry was mouth-watering and I couldn't get enough. (I didn't really want to share, but I kind of had to...) There was no one at the café when we got there, so it was very quiet and warm, and the people working there were kind and attentive. It was exactly what we needed after walking around a cold, snowy Vieux-Montréal all morning.

So that great dessert experience then prompted us to buy macarons (cassis, mangue-passion, pistache, praliné, chocolat and noix de coco - all perfectly made and very flavorful), canalé (just as it should be) and meringue café et amandes and this awesome-looking chocolate/hazelnut dessert spread thing we have yet to try.

Long story short, this place is awesome and if I'm ever in Montréal again, I will mostly be sleeping and eating here for the duration of my visit."}
{"text":"Maison Christian Faure has been my sweet spots for desserts, and now I just realized I haven't left any reviews yet! 

This place is like a gem in Montreal, especially when you are craving for very well-made boutique style desserts in Montreal. The place reminds me as if I were somewhere in cake boutique in Paris. All sorts of small cakes are varied by seasons according to fruits' availability, and every dessert that I ever tried there never disappointed me. I liked a lot of their fruit covered desserts such as strawberry millefeuille, tropical fruit tarts. Their chocolates were great as well. 

Space is not perfect for taking time there (sitting for a while for chat and brunch). There are some seats but it is quite narrow space, and not pleasant for relaxing. I recommend visiting Old Montreal location for this. This place is more suitable for a quick pick up.

Not just for a bunch, or small desserts, I recommend buying some whole cakes, as a housewarming gift when you are visiting friends. The price range will be around $40-50 for a whole cake, which you might think a bit expensive at first glance, but it is worth paying that much money. The taste is good and the presentation of cake is phenomenal. 

Tip. 
Check website in advance to get an idea which variety is available now - https://maisonchristianfaure.ca/en/product-category/pastry-shop/cakes-2/ (still some cakes might have been sold out) 
Good to know. 
Rather than buying little pieces, it's more economical buying a whole cake, (you might know already) taxes will not be rated for a whole cake, which is good for the large quantity."}
{"text":"We simply ordered the classic croissants, well, because we're always looking for the best classics.  Absolutely found them!  Large, beautiful golden color, crispy outside, buttery inside (but not slick), perfect with jam.

All the pastries and cakes were works of art, clearly made by pros (our diet won't let us splurge but you should!)"}
{"text":"Yelp should give an option of a sixth star and I would give it to this establishment.

I am a Pastry chef and would die to go back to Paris to get that one taste of a perfectly crackly croissant or a well made pastry. Well, I did not have to travel too far from NYC to get the same. Montreal has Christian Faure and his pastry shop makes the real french stuff! We visited Montreal during the long weekend and the shop was quite packed. We picked up a couple of pastries and hot chocolate- and please do try the hot chocolate here- again a specialty which is as good as the french make it.

We tried the tropical dessert, opera and some macarons. Ofcourse we wanted to try the eclairs and the mango passionfruit dessert too but it was just the 2 of us!! Everything was delicious and fresh. We took our goodies and sat outside as the day was quite nice.

They also serve brunch/lunch which we hope to try during our next visit."}
{"text":"A little pricey but really great food. I had the lunch combo to include the meat pie, an eclair and a fantastic cup of coffee. 

My wife had the soufflé and a lemon tart that was also quite delicious.  Would go out of the way to pick up some baked goods next time."}
{"text":"Delicious chocolate croissants and pastries. This place is packed but is worth the wait. We were told by someone that this place is just as good as Paris bakeries so we gave it a try and it didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Looks can truly be deceiving. Everything in the shop looked amazing, but I left very disappointed.

I came in and tried the macarons and a hot chocolate on a rainy afternoon. The macarons were too sweet and I could barely taste the flavors that they're labeled as. The almond meal was clearly not sifted through properly because the shells were grainy.

The hot chocolate was the right texture and consistency but also way too sweet to be enjoyable. I tossed out half of it because it was too sweet to finish."}
{"text":"The deserts here look so nice! I feel satisfied already just by looking at them! And of course, they taste very good. Their iced tea is amazing too. It doesn't taste like ordinary iced tea. The flavor is really rich. But I have to say the service here is very very slow. The staff is not attentive at all and we had to wait for a long time to get our check."}
{"text":"omg awesome afternoon tea place for great bakeries or cakes. Even the iced lemonade maison was so good"}
{"text":"I can only speak to the coffee at this place, I was so full from dinner that I couldn't get myself to try a pastry but 4 stars on service and coffee. Tried the mochachino which was fantastic. I really love how even the local cafe serves fresh espresso no matter what time of the day. The place is very cute inside and they had fantastic pastries that all looked fantastic. The staff was very friendly and even at an hour to closing, people were pouring in through the door."}
{"text":"We spent quite a bit of time looking for a French bakery while we were here in Montréal, and this was definitely worth the time to find! We were looking specifically for macaroons and we found them and much more. Once we saw the beautifully made pastries we had to taste more than macaroons. We sat down in the upscale bakery and had strawberry shortcake, chocolate tarts and praline éclairs. All were very delicious and worth the price. Yes, the bakery is a bit pricey, but the food you receive is well worth it! After having our desserts, espresso and hot chocolate we got an assortment of macaroons to go. Those were equally delicious to the pastries we are in the bakery.  As for the atmosphere it was upscale, and welcoming."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, attentive staff... great place to pop in for coffee, wine or sweet treat. Their pastries are delicious with a wide variety. They also serve brunch/lunch. Throughout the week my husband and I ordered the lemon tart, passion fruit tart, chocolate raspberry cake, lemon sorbet, Chablis wine, Bordeaux wine, latte and cappuccino... all were delightful. You will be very happy with any choice here."}
{"text":"I've been all over the world and this place makes my top 20 list. Definitely not the best I've had but considering we're in North America this was seriously impressive. 

Definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"I went there for 4 weeks in a row to try all of their non-fruity desserts.Their croissants are really good, but the other desserts are a hit and miss. The hazelnut cream cake was extremely bitter from the excess of rhum, the chocolate mousse cake and brownies were soso, the éclairs were pretty good. They change their dessert selections every once in a while. It's a 5 star for their croissants, but 3 stars for the other sweets."}
{"text":"Terrific option for brunch, and an outstanding source for French pastry. 

There's a counter in front, loaded with every sweet treat of your dreams, plus a grab-and-go case filled with sandwiches, drinks, fruit, etc. The seating area was filled with tourists, but plenty of locals wandered in for a to-go croissant and coffee.

Brunch is a casual affair, but both the quality and service are perfect, which is surprising for the most maligned meal of the week. Our waiter, in particular, was a model of good humor and professionalism. 

[Of course, we had to return for a dozen macarons on our way to the airport. Forget the T-shirts; THIS is the souvenir your friends are waiting for.]

The chic interior is sophisticated but relaxed. There are stairs leading up from the street, so if you have a stroller or mobility issues, please take this into account."}
{"text":"great tea time spot! the desserts were so good! we had to get a 2nd round!

the passion fruit tart was my boyfriend's favorite!
the maple tart was also very delicious!

lovely setting and the service was great! *2 thumbs up!*"}
{"text":"Delicious pastries and coffee, very clean, and the staff went out of their way to be helpful. The ambiance left a little to be desired... Maybe some music? 

We tried the lemon meringue tart and a Paris Brest eclair, plus espresso and tea. All delicious, all served at the perfect temperature. Like a little Pierre Herme right in Montreal. Well done."}
{"text":"Not much I can add to what's already been said here.

My family and I had a wonderful lunch followed by some incredible desserts.

Well ran, clean facility.  Great service, awesome food.

If you are visiting Vieux Montreal, make this one of your must eat at places!"}
{"text":"Maison Christian Faure was recommended to us by the Omni concierge. He said it was a classical french pastry shop with an atelier on the second floor -- obviously, we had to check it out.

The Illy coffee we had here was the best I had in my entire trip. The croissant was quite good, but I'm more used to a crusty croissant with a soft interior. This croissant was soft everywhere. Additionally, I ordered the quinoa salad; it was tasty and the vegetables were very fresh, but it was overly sweet.

This place is a very cute place to hang out and get a pastry and some coffee, but I wouldn't order a meal here again."}
{"text":"What can I say? When I purchased the wafer-chocolate mouse pastry, I thought it was overpriced...until I took the first bite.  It was culinary heaven! Truly thought I had died and gone to heaven. IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY! The flavors, visual appeal, texture....just outstanding. Chef Christian Faure has earned his great reputation."}
{"text":"One of the best pastries with a relaxing seating area. The biggest challenge is a making a decision which one to eat! I couldn't stop after one. I ate two and bought a few for tonight."}
{"text":"best pastry chef in mtl we are lucky he decided to make this institution here in mtl and teach ppl about real pastry making for quebecers i always go back for the passion fruit tart TO DIE FOR"}
{"text":"Yelp didn't lie. 
Came here after seeing the good rating. 
It is worth checking out if you are a tourist in Montreal. An afternoon dessert after a visit to Notre Dame Basilique is so delightful.
The staff brought to each table a tray of all deserts of the day and introduced all of them. 
Honestly all of them look tasty! But since we are (trying to be) self-disciplined ladies we got one piece each. 
Mont Blanc was !"}
{"text":"Divine little hidden gem. If you are searching for a very fancy dessert. This is your jam. I was very impressed with the intricacies of the work into each piece like artwork. We took a few home to enjoy later that night and each bite was heaven."}
{"text":"White chocolate coffee pastry - tasted delicious and presented beautifully!! My husband enjoyed a perfect lemon meringue (real meringue) tarte."}
{"text":"Their presentation is so elegant. From desserts to decor, this place was absolutely cute. Everything had a nice sparkle with a terrible voice inside your head that whispered, \"Just. Buy. Everything.\" 

The food tasted as great as it looked. The croissants were fluffy and melted in your mouth. This place attracts tourists for a reason - appearance as well as taste. Everything is Instagram-friendly from whatever angle you're sitting at to your cup of water to your tiny dessert. I feel like everything I sampled from what we ordered was fluffy and light. It makes you want to eat more... as well as eat everything. 

I got an iced latte that taste splendid. The service was awesome, allowing us to continue to add more to our to-go order as well as explaining what some desserts displayed were. Speaking English fluently also helped out a lot! Definitely a spot to enjoy coffee and dessert. I wish I could've tried their main entrees, and I'm sure everything here is at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"We were told if you do anything in Montreal, you have to have French pastries. After some careful research, we ended up at Maison Christian Faure. We were staying at the Governour's Hotel in Quartier Latin, and despite frigid temperatures, we decided to walk over to Old Port (about fifteen minutes or so). As noted by other reviews, MCF is tucked away on a side street and could be easily missed if you're not looking out for it.  When you enter, there are stairs leading up, and down. Down, I'm assuming, is the pastry school, whereas the dining area and pastry shop is upstairs. The pastry counter is the first thing you see when you walk up the stairs (macarons to be exact), and I'm pretty sure I began salivating right away, while planning my to-go pastry strategy.

The space is very sleek with a bit of rustic charm, and bright and airy. We were seated by the window, and the angle of the sunlight made it hard for me to take pictures of my food. C'est la vie. We both got the brunch plank, which was the perfect amount of food. It started with a chocolate croissant each, layers of flakiness and bits of chocolate galore. Sadly, the croissants arrived before our espresso, and I could barely wait. Then, the plank came, with a cup of fresh fruit, a slice of brioche, a side of caramel sauce, and a delightful spin on eggs benedict (I got the salmon, my partner the ham). It was just enough to leave room for dessert. I got macarons to try later, and found them less than stellar but not detracting from my overall impression of MCF. I'll make this place a must-stop on subsequent trips to Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best patisseries I have ever seen. I could eat here every morning and have the best of everything. Staff is great and facilities clean and lighted. A must see to believe and taste."}
{"text":"Came for the croissants and they were just ok.  The other pastries looked awesome though."}
{"text":"Had brunch at this place and it was really great! Although there isn't a lot of choice for food, both meals we had were amazing and the presentation was really great!"}
{"text":"Latte's and croissants made by a world class chef. Everything not only look amazing but tasted even better. Friendly service in an inviting atmosphere.  Went back for some deserts for the ride back home."}
{"text":"The pastries are beautiful and delicious and the pastry case provides a great photo opportunity."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a dessert and a drink. My friend had a creme brûlée type dessert with a latte and was so pleased she got another to take with us. I had the lemon meringue tart, which was divine. The pistachio macaroon was good also. I ordered a chocolate croissant to take away and it was amazing too. Only giving 4 stars as the service was a little slow and had to remind waiter about drinks/items ordered a few times. Otherwise a terrific experience and would definitely return.  The lunches around us looked pretty terrific so this would make a great lunch spot and not just a place for dessert!"}
{"text":"Service was not good and the ham and cheese croissant was cold in the middle. Unfortunately this place seems to be a tourist trap from my experience."}
{"text":"Delicious pastries. We sat down, grabbed our homemade lemonade, and ordered out pastries. They bring a tray with all the different options so you can see what are are going to order. A must stop!"}
{"text":"After spending the majority of my Montreal trip in Le Plateau and other small surrounding hoods, I decided to venture into the more touristy area of Old Montreal to take in the sights. We started in the main downtown area walking along and decided to swing by Notre Dame on our way to the old port. In need of a coffee that wasn't from Starbucks we found this cafe.

When we first walked in, there was a cluster of tourists jamming up the works. I don't know why but they were taking pictures of everything they could find and letting nobody through. This was a red flag, but we marched on. With the confusion it was tough to figure out if we were to go through the line or sit at a table. We found out we could sit but then it was almost ten minutes before anyone came to serve us. We could have just finished waiting in line at that point.

Aside from the chaos on the way in, everything else was amazing. I had an amazing chocolate pot de creme and an americano. I would have stuck around for some macaroons, but everything was just taking too long and we needed to get moving. 

Pro Tip: The bathroom is up the elevator on the 4th floor."}
{"text":"Alert: Prettiness overload!

I visited MCF during the past Thanksgiving 2017 and I happened to be around the Old Montreal neighborhood with my friends. MCF completely meet my expectation of French food/patisserie at Montreal, everything looked and tasted great! I remembered getting seated at the cafe (it wasn't very crowded somehow on that weekend and got seated right away) and my eyes completely drawn over to the wide array of dessert on display and completely mesmerized by them. And to top it off, when the waitress came by to present some of the pastries, I wanted to try all of them! Anyhow, after mulling and being indecisive for several minutes -
 and making heart cringing decisions - feels comparable like you are you are a manager of job about to forcibly laying off some of your awesone direct reports due to company's financial reason (in this case - due to my budgetary limitation) --- I managed to decide over what I ordered for the table. We stuck with chicken pot pie, Almost croissant, Canelle, and  bunch of cute mini deserts (see pics). I recalled the dessert being way too pretty to eat - everything details of appearance seemed to be thought out and felt like slicing something open by knife felt like a violation, and it tasted even better. The croissant and canelle was crispy and sweet but not overpowering. The chicken pot pies was comforting, and had a flaky texture, perfectly buttery taste - and did not taste cheap at all. 

Sure, I felt I could have been more financially responsible after spending about CAD 60 altogether on *just* luxurious desserts but it's one of those decisions that I did not regret at all looking back.

Bottom line - Be sure to check out MCF when in Montreal! It's one of the epitome of French food culinary in Montreal."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for coffee and pastries. As well documented, the shop is part of the culinary school and a must stop while in Vieux-Montréal. All their tempting goodies are worth every calorie and carb. So order away."}
{"text":"Bon sans être magique , et vraiment trop cher pour le produit . De jolies créations en boutique ."}
{"text":"I went to get breakfast at 7:45am this morning. The other places around weren't open yet, so we were directed to come to this place. The person from Epik hotel said that they have amazing almond croissants.

I ordered an almond croissant as well as a tea. It was delicious! However, it was a little too heavy for me. I could only finish half of it! The people who were with me finished their croissants, so maybe it's just me! The tea was very nice though. The cashier/waiter gave me a huge box of teas to pick from. He also gave me a few recommendations and gave me a paper with all the descriptions. 

The cashier was super friendly, but at 7:45am, they were very busy! Customers kept coming in and ordering crazy amounts of pasties (ex. One lady came in and said, \"I'll only take one dozen today\"). A lot of people were requesting the almond croissant. But they only had 5 in the morning and they ran out within 10min! It was insane!

I can't wait to drag all my friends there!"}
{"text":"Lovely little spot and a nice place for lunch when in the old port - albeit slightly pricey for what you get. They also have a nice selection of pastries, ice cream, and sorbets. Apparently, they also offer cooking classes - but I haven't had the chance to try those."}
{"text":"Had dessert and drinks with my dad at Maison Christian Faure....here are my thoughts:

Ambiance - this place is VERY cute. Really loved the cozy atmosphere.

Service - very friendly and desserts came out quickly.

Desserts - I couldn't partake in anything because nothing was dairy-free, but my father, who never likes anything declared his Napolean \"wonderful.\" He also referred to his cappuccino as \"excellent.\" Since he rarely compliments anything this was an amazing surprise.

Overall - Although I wasn't able to eat anything at Christian Faure, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"WOW just WOW!

I have had croissants all over the world from Paris to Tokyo, the Chocolate Almond Croissant here is the BEST I have ever tasted. 

We stopped there multiple times on a 2 day visit. 

It is a MUST!"}
{"text":"While on a family trip through Old Montreal, my aunt, a long-time resident in Quebec, steered my family and I toward this cute little French patisserie tucked away nearby a number of tourist staples and local bars. As a huge fan of French pastries, I guess you could say I was more than thrilled to rest my weary feet and enjoy a nice cafe au lait.

The atmosphere of the cafe is modern-day yet traditional: the entrance features a colorful mural and the interior with its exposed brick wall, was accented with white decor and metal tables. Our server brought us that afternoon's available treats on a large silver platter, of which we chose to sample the eclairs, a chocolate mousse cake, and a white chocolate and pistachio cake. I also decided to sample a cappuccino (though to be fair, I really just wanted to see what art they'd put on top, which ended up actually being a little disappointing).

The cappuccino was the perfect balance of bitter and sweet; overall, it was a good balance of the robust coffee flavor and wasn't too cloying. All of our sweets, were, however, a bit sweeter than I traditionally prefer. However, they were all executed incredibly well and had great textures and flavors, nothing short of what I expected from a restaurant owned by the best pastry chef in the world.

We picked up a number of croissants for road, which turned out to be incredibly flaky, buttery, and still were fantastic (not even soggy, yes!) a few days later. It was certainly one of this pastry shop's most redeeming treats.

Overall, Maison Christian Faure certainly met my expectations. While I may not have the biggest sweet tooth, I hope to return someday to take one of its many cooking and baking classes to make my own renditions of their famous treats."}
{"text":"We arrived a little later in the afternoon and there weren't many desserts to choose from.  What we tried was good but not amazing and we would have liked a few more options."}
{"text":"Had a WONDERFUL experience here.  Every single staff member we came into contact with was so, so welcoming and kind - and it drove home to me how rare that is, when I'm in a French-speaking place, unfortunately. But the service here was pretty much perfect.

The food also was, of course, wonderful. The chef deserves every one of the many awards he's received.

We had a smoked salmon salad platter, a pastry each, and two drinks - courtesy of the deal we scored on their website where you can also get access to the Scandinave spa. The food was really good. If you choose to buy anything to bring home, it's SO EXPENSIVE - $14 for a bag of marshmallows, $14 for a jar of jam, $8.50 for a pastry if you eat in (vs. $6.75 for take out) - but it's all excellent quality.

Wonderful spot, and highly recommended especially if you plan to go to the spa."}
{"text":"I have only gotten pastries for take out but they never disappoint! Everything is so good and definitely some of the best classic French pastries in the city!"}
{"text":"Coffee was very very good, but the hazelnut pastry was the best ever. Service was great, we waited 15 min for a table but well worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"There's no language barrier when it comes to food! Yes, the staff has minimal English, but it was better than my French. The croissants are all they should be- light, flaky, oozing butter. Coffee is also superb and from the oilily maker. We were lucky to not hit peak, were seated at a window table. Lots of fun to watch other tourists struggle in communicating because they can't/won't make an attempt at French 101. 

Take some macarons to go....you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Delicious deserts. Expensive.  The day we went service was very slow, so hopefully it's not like that everyday. 
Easy location to get to."}
{"text":"Service impeccable mais attachez vos tuques .. chaque patisserie coute 8$ ... j'imagine que c'est bio ... or something like that ... deco girly .... pour des soirées \"entre filles\" ... local au RDC mais les toilettes privés sont au 4eme etage ... original .. possibilité d'une petite vite en hauteur ;)"}
{"text":"We spotted this place while on a carriage ride and decided to come back to eat.  We have 5 kids so we are always a bit nervous about venturing into smallish cafes, but this turned out to be a wonderful experience.  They did not have any kids menu options but not a huge issue for us as we typically don't like the kid options that restaurants have.  The staff was great and it was not an issue that we do not speak French. The meals were very good and the desserts were fantastic.  We would go there again."}
{"text":"Beyond amazing! Perfectly executed flavors & presentation. World reknown pastry chef earned his stripes for sure! Best French pastries I have ever tasted...in the world. No lie. Good prices for what you get too. Crisp modern decor. Can't say enough about how good it is."}
{"text":"One of the best deserts for French pastry. Their macarons are to die for and their pastries are amazing! I had the harlequin and loved it. The mousse in the pots was also out of this world. It was combined with so many textures which made it quite heavenly. Share the deserts when you got there so you have the chance to taste Mr. Faure's
beautiful creations! 

Presentation and taste is 5*. We need more places like his in Montreal!

PS: they make AMAZING lattes so make sure to order one when you're tasting all these heavenly deserts!"}
{"text":"Just purchased macaroons from here and some croissants. Very yummy. The guy at the front was very helpful with helping us decide. They have brunch there but we didn't get a chance to eat there."}
