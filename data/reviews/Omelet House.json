{"text":"I am not a breakfast person but enjoyed this restaurant. Diner style experience. Very busy but well staffed and efficiently run. We were asked three times within a matter of a minute if someone had taken our drink order. Staff was knowledgeable and the owner was walking by when I placed my order and pointed out that they their potatoes are more like cottage fries than traditional hash browns when I ordered the hash browns. Friendly staff with great, fast service. A huge variety of omelets and other breakfast fare. I am interested in returning and trying lunch. My 11 year old wanted to go back the next day for breakfast once again."}
{"text":"This is the best omelet I've ever had for the money. The service is great! The owner is there the majority of the time. The quality of the bread is incredible as well as the omelets. Best to get there in the morning around 8 a.m. anything after that it gets pretty busy."}
{"text":"Morning Food   After a night of little slumber We woke up with much hunger We drove about 2 miles And Kristi/Kristy(?) greeted us with BIG smiles  The food was oh so yummy It filled up all my tummy I even left some on the plate And it all cost a little more than $8"}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed.  The food is fantastic and extremely fresh.  This will be our breakfast stop each time we come to Vegas.  Worth the short drive."}
{"text":"A modest but comfortable diner. The food is very good, the service was friendly and efficient, and the prices are reasonable. Would definitely recommend this for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went here to try it out since it has been a while since I ate here. I would have never thought that this place is pretty big until the hostess sat my bf, daughter and I. Pretty good place to bring a big group of people.   They have lots of different omelets, which they all sound really delicious. Out of all the omelets to choose from I ordered the \"Just Cheese\" which is an omelet with your choice of cheese, but I added mushrooms since I love my mushrooms. When the waiter brought out my omelet, man was it huge (good to share with someone). I even ordered the baby size, an I was full after my 5th bite. The potato chips that it comes with is really good, it was crispy and fresh. The waiter forgot my pumpkin bread, I did remind her that I never got it, even though I knew I had no room in my stomach I just wanted to try it. Pumpkin bread was really delicious and you can tell that it's made fresh.   I am definitely coming back to order the mushroom burger! That's a must try if your a mushroom fan (the very first time I came here I ordered the mushroom burger so I know it's really good)."}
{"text":"Absolute best place to go after a night on the strip... if you're still alive. Not very convenient if you don't have a car, but if you do, try this place for breakfast. This is the home of the \"10 egg omelet!\""}
{"text":"Awesome food, huge portions. Next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Easy atmosphere, really yummy food!  Try the chips (round sliced french fries)!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch and had a wonderful time. Our waitress was Irene, and she knew everything about everything on the menu. She obviously loves the food here and loves her job. We had the banana bread and the pumpkin bread and it was great. The pumpkin bread had a little too much nutmeg for me, but that's my preference. Both breads were very moist and the portions were large. My husband and I each got a different omelette with the chips, and I could not begin to finish mine.  There are so many choices on the menu and such a variety of breakfast foods. I would visit here again."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Omelet House for about 5 years.  Every time the food is wonderful and the service is great.  You get a lot of food for your money and it is always delicious!  My favorite is the omelets!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"excellent omelet with great variety.  lots of space and good service,  rustic atmosphere at the back of a strip mall"}
{"text":"Great local alternative to the over poplar Hash House chain. Must try!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and this place is a fail again. First of all I ordered the corn beef hash and it says in there menu \"best you'll ever have\" wrong it was horrible. I rather eat it from the can, second our server was rude. Shirley never came back to check on us. Just like my first visit with another old lady. The old lady servers are rude and old they shouldn't be working there. Later on she still never came back to check on us but I see her slip the check on our table and walk away. Then when it was time to pay I asked for the manager and then she was trying to defend her self and then they didn't wanna take our coupons. Horrible service here. I don't understand how the mayor can go there to eat . All the young bussers there should be the servers. I will never go back there again"}
{"text":"I went there about 10:30 on a Saturday morning and was seated within a minute or so.  The hostess took my drink order and brought that and the server (Ava) came right over.  I ordered an asparagus omelet which was huge and loaded with asparagus and the wonderful pumpkin bread.  Everything came nice and hot and my coffee cup never went empty.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing service. I would come back to Henderson just to come here! Pork verde omelette and pumpkin bread are to die for!"}
{"text":"Happy Fathers Day to the owner. My fathers day as well as my son's father day was ruined from the moment we entered his restaurant. The host (who happens to be the owner), was the rudest person I have ever met. He made it very clear his business model is how many people he can herd through his establishment and not at all about customer service. It was not just my family he was rude to, it was everyone (my heartfelt sympathy goes out to his employees. It must be embarrassing to work for someone like that). As a business owner myself for many years in Las Vegas, I can assure you that if I treated my customers that way I would be out of business! Personally, I will never step foot in his restaurants again. The owner might want to step down as host and hire someone with some tact to take his place."}
{"text":"The food is great as well as the prices. The staff is hit or miss. The lady that sat us was very nice but our waitress was superficial, and very short with us. Seems like she didn't have any time for us. It wasn't busy so I can only think she just didn't like us. Her tip surely reflected the service given."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. We were in a rush and they accommodated us even though they were obviously slammed. I had the huevos rancheros louie style because I rarely have an opportunity to eat something smothered in green chile and it was fantastic. The only bad thing about my meal is that I had to chose tortillas as the choice of bread instead of the banana nut or pumpkin bread. They served huge slices of homemade breads that were delicious."}
{"text":"Food was great here. For the price and the amount of food that you get, you really can not go wrong. The only thing that I found to be quite dreadful was the service. When we walked in no one that worked there was at sight.  Once we were finally acknowledged and seated by a lady who looked like she was still stuck in 1989, she asked me what I wanted to drink. Before I even opened my mouth she just walked away to go and talk to some one whom she knew. Just by that, the rest of my experience was quite uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I love this place, They have the biggest omelette for a cheap price, the banana nut bread is amazing its the main reason I go they serve it with butter. Staff is always awesome and I love the fact they have a lot of vintage Vegas objects everywhere"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this location.  We have been going there since Oct.  They have great staff!  Their rewards program is easy and worth it also.  The recently changed their menu and I would NOT recommend the waffles.  New item and they have not mastered the recipe or cooking temperature."}
{"text":"Stopped on our way from Lake Las Vegas to the airport.  SO MUCH GOOD FOOD!  Don't even consider anything larger than the \"baby\" omelette.  The banana  bread is fabulous...warm and full of nuts!  Server DENA very friendly.  The \"spuds\" are really homemade potato chips but we were too full to eat them!"}
{"text":"First reciption in German: Die Bedinungen waren sehr freundlich und das essen war sehr gut.. Au√üerdem ist es  viel zu essen (aber es gibt schlimmeres )"}
{"text":"Yeah no surprise here.  A gem in Las Vegas I think.  Yes, it is an old place, old like someone in the 60's just can't.... get out of the 60's.  But there's nothing wrong with the 60's.  hahaha  Food is excellent.  Some stuff is greasy, but who doesn't like a little grease every once and a while.  I've never had a bad meal there.  I'm eaten there maybe on 10 separate occassions.  I've tried everything, and they have everything.  The meals are more than enough to fill you up.  The prices are average.  And it isn't all deep fried crap you can get anywhere.  Good, cooked food, in a nice old place like your Grandma would take you too, this is totally a 5 stars place.  If you don't live close to it, it is totally worth the drive.  Excellent, excellent, excellent."}
{"text":"I honestly don't think I've ever had a bad meal at the Omelet House! I've been going for probably 5 years now... I LOVE their omelets and the spuds too of course. Their banana nut bread is amazing too. Any other choice on their menu is awesome too. My fiance really loves the stuffed french toast with blueberries on top. It reminds me of my moms cooking and I'd recommend it to anyone :)"}
{"text":"If your looking for a big breakfast, this is the place to come. I ordered the \"Kitchen Sink\". You better have your appetite ready for this big monster. It has everything! This literally could be split with 2 people. And then there's Banana Nut Bread?! Yes, you read right! Banana Nut Bread!! Need to be enticed more? Check the picture."}
{"text":"The omelettes this place puts out are as delicious as they are huge. If you're not a big eater, consider getting the baby size -- 3 eggs instead of 6 but about the same amount of fillings.  They have a few options for lunch, which are all very decent as well, but the real star of the show's breakfast."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  I opted to go with the smaller size omelet and it was plenty of food.  I tried the Bugsy Siegel, very good. So many choices of omelets you could eat here everyday for a year and not get through the menu. Biscuits and gravy were tasty as well. If you love eggs definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I visited the Omelet house today with my boyfriend! And holy cow or should I say holy omelet! My boyfriend ordered the Bugsy Seagal omelet, it was beyond huge. Looked very delicious! I ordered the Waffle special nothing to fancy. And they do have one of the best biscuit and gravy! Good place I would go again!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas! The omelets are huge and the spuds/potatoes are unique and delicious.  I'm not one to care about service at a restaurant but if your are big on service, they deliver.  From the time you are greeted until you leave, friendly and fast service.  Definitely check this spot out when your in town."}
{"text":"This place take you back to a time when food taste real and the service was real also. Like that diner where everybody knows your name. Where the portions kill your stomach but not your wallet. Cant believe i have never heard of this place. A must go. Z"}
{"text":"Food is very good! Service was also on point! Very attentive to anything you need or would like. Very reasonably priced. Locally owned too!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, the foods was perfect. Came with 8 people, everyone was happy and satisfied. The omelets were huge and delicious, enough for 2 people. My chicken fried steak was very good. Service was very attentive and prompt. Would come again and recommend this to others.  5 stars++"}
{"text":"Only went here once on way from LV to Hoover dam. Was Sunday brunch time so busiest time of week.  Only had to wait 10 mins to be seated, place was clean (v important for me), service was excellent, food excellent (big portions & not greasy at all as b/fast places usually are), menu is varied but not crazy extensive, didn't have to wait too long for food to be served. What's not to like.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"Omelette House is one of those places that probably inspired the likes of Hash Houses, Pancake House & many others. Staff is likable and energetic- the guy on the wall was actually there!  Coffee was great and they brought our Pumpkin Spice Bread while we waited.  Food was delicious and visually AWESOME- corned beef was the best ever.  I love avocado and guac- and they must have put a lb in my omelette.  The place has been there for 19 years, and I know why.  Henderson isn't the place most would drive to JUST for breakfast- but I'll be back this weekend..."}
{"text":"A must. Tired of eating buffets? This place is off the strip and plenty of food at a reasonable price. I had the pollack omelet. Sausage and real cheddar cheese. I could not finish it all.  The location is in a strip mall towards the back. Try the banana bread that comes as an option instead of toast. No regrets."}
{"text":"Very good food...service was great very homie place. I got French toast and potatoes. Potatoes were delicious try them !!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Huevo Rancheros, the generous portions are for people who love to eat and really appreciate great food.   The staff is very warm,friendly and professional.   I do appreciate that it is conveniently located down the street from me, so my friends and I enjoy this place often.  Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Came in today and met a wonderful manager his name is Kevin best service I think I've ever had in the restaurant business in a long time very prompt with coffee creamer very sweet man a lot of people in the business could learn from him so if you need tips come see Kevin at omelette house he's amazing!! On top of him being amazing the food is awesome as well very good portion sizes in just very flavorful food!"}
{"text":"Aawsome food and you get a lot of it.  The wait staff was real attentive.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great value. Friendly service. Comfort food that you won't find on the strip, definitely at these affordable prices. My wife and I had breakfast here and we didn't need to eat for another 8 hours we left so completely full and satisfied. The building looks like an old Denny's restaurant but they keep it pretty clean. Food was hot when it hit the table and delicious from start to finish. Eggs cooked just the way we ordered, english muffins that were toasted and buttered perfectly. Most restaurants never butter your toast or muffins properly. It is the small details that this place takes care of. The potatoes were very thick potato chips, cut and fried crispy hot. When I come back to Vegas, (hope it is not very soon) I plan to have several meals here instead of the over priced, over hyped Vegas strip restaurants. Don't let the old building keep you away. Go in and get full on good comfort food. If you are a snob, you probably won't go in and quite frankly, I'd prefer that you don't."}
{"text":"I had the omelet with lobster and it was delicious. The best place in Vegas for breakfast"}
{"text":"If you think IHOP of Dennis is good, that's because you've never been to Omelet House. This place is cozy and the food is delicious !! Must try. Guaranteed to love."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great food, friendly staff. And they can handle a rush like a boss.  The homemade corned beef hash and eggs is my usual order and it's the best."}
{"text":"We tried the Omelet House again after several months.  Of course, it was packed for breakfast.  The atmosphere is great;  the staff is very friendly and efficient even during the hectic periods.  The food is still pretty good.  Everything was cooked to order. The Country Scrambler was delicious and their sausage patties were great.   Our only disappointment was that the coffee wasn't as good as we remembered, and their potatoes were more like crispy chips.  They would be good with a sandwich, but they're a little too crunchy with a breakfast.  All in all, it's a really nice place for a generous meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My family and I were in the area for a funeral and needed to find a place to have breakfast for a small group. This place was AMAZING! Service was great and the food was even better. The \"regular\" sized omelette was huge! And it comes with a choice of bread ( I chose the pumpkin bread-YUMMY!) and a side of homemade potato slices. This place might look old but the food definitely makes up for it!! I will always come back here when I visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here with my mom and they were very attentive. The omelette was HUGE and the potato things on the side were BOMB. I didn't even finish my omelette, I had leftovers and it was totally delicious. I'd definitely come back here. The environment is so welcoming and even though there was a tiny line to get seated, we got a table in like five minutes."}
{"text":"The Omelet House is one of the best places to eat in the city. Great food (BE HUNGRY!) very good service. Yes the ambience is dated, but who cares! The food is great!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast!  GREAT customer service!  I am terrible at getting names- but our server was a sweetie who made us laugh when joking around with my oldest son who clearly did NOT need that extra egg he asked for in his omelet!  Ha!  Never one to back down- he ate the whole thing!  I'm pretty sure he got the Lox- #39.  My other son had The Polak (no joke!).  The menu is pretty funny but the omelets are HUGE- no joke!  My boyfriend was satisfied with his chicken fried steak and eggs but we both thought the gravy was a bit salty.    I had a wonderful time there but my breakfast was my least favorite.  I had eggs over medium and they were a bit under-done.  To be fair, I didn't say a word but I'm sure they would have fixed my order.  I was the only one bothered by the \"surprise\" potato chips.  I LOVE hash browns but when I asked for my hash browns extra crispy, our waitress did not correct me.  However, the chips were tasty!  Now, on the upside, I was in LOVE with the pumpkin bread (which actually filled me up before my breakfast came) so I really didn't care about the other stuff!  Next time,  I will share an omelet with my sweetie!   This is definitely a great departure from casino buffets!  We got there around 10:30 and didn't wait at all.  When we left, however, there was a bit of a line.  The place was packed but, like I said, service was excellent:  efficient, quick, friendly.   Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Too many omelets to choose. So made up my own, and it was delicious. The spud chips were very fid as well.  I missed the part where they mention they are 6 egg omelets, so be warned you need to be really hungry, have a way to reheat leftovers, or opt for the \"small\" 3 egg version.  Staff was very friendly and attentive from entering to leaving."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Great food, great service, great owners. Make sure you're hungry when you go there. The portions are huge."}
{"text":"Breakfast is our favorite meal a day, so We are picky and were too skeptical about any places in Las Vegas. Searched a lot before picking up this place and were pleased to have friendly greeting and delicious food. I got large salad with strawberries and feta cheese, for me it was too sweet and I could not eat more than a half, but I really enjoyed. My husband got special omelet with bacon, everything looked amazing. Thank you)"}
{"text":"Greatest place to go for Breakfast on the Boulder Highway in Henderson!  Large portions, good value, and great food quality... the spuds (breakfast potatoes) rock my world!   Wonderful home-made banana and pumpkin breads, Chicken Fried Steak is awesome.  Staff friendly and fast service.  Lunch is good, their Mexican food is very good.  Do not expect the decor of a high end restaurant, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"We came to the Omelet House because it was close to where we were staying, and the first review on Yelp was about the pumpkin bread.  I was NOT disappointed!  The pumpkin bread was as big as a piece of cake!  It came out warm with butter.  It was wonderful!  I ordered the #36, omelet with pork green chili.  I ordered the \"baby omelet\" which was supposed to be a smaller sized omelet...if this is small then the regular must be super sized!  Son got the pancakes with bacon and eggs.  Needless to say he cleaned his plate!  The menu is huge and doesn't disappoint, and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, huge portions, forget hash browns, these homemade chips are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Omelet House has been a go-to spot for years!  We probably have lunch here at least once a month.  I love the cheesy, homey decor that is comforting like you're going to grandma's house to eat!  First thing first, whatever you get - get it with SPUDS.  I'm a potato lover and these are the best fried potatoes I've had anywhere! If you want an appetizer to share - go with the FRIED ZUCCHINI - omg good!  Half order is good for 2-3 people, get the cheese AND ranch.   Next, unless you are starving - order your OMELET \"baby size\".  They come out in generous portions.  There are so many options on the omelet - I like the California, BB&C and Farmer's.  Surprisingly however this is my favorite place to order CHICKEN FINGERS! The tenders are thin and not \"bready\".  I throw some RED HOT on them and they are the best!    Oh and the PATTY MELT on the evenly toasted bread.. SO many yummy options to choose from at Omelet House - you can't go wrong!.."}
{"text":"The food is good.  I had subbed my potatoes and toast for some fruit and had to pay extra.  Might come back if I am in the area again.  But I won't be going out of my way.  Service was ok.  Waitress seems she would rather be somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Omelet House for breakfast and it was really busy.  I heard about their lobster eggs benedict, but since I am not a benedict fan, I opted for the lobster fest omelet which was ginormous.  The potato chips were a pleasant surprise and pumpkin bread is a must order.  Waitress was quick and attentive.  Overall good experience, nice place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Family Friendly for over 40 years!!! After a few days on the Vegas strip make your way home to Phoenix and be sure to stop here for your best breakfast experience. Home Made Cooking at it's finest."}
{"text":"This was more filler food than anything. The \"Joe\" omelet I had was really bland. I had to dump lots of cholula sauce on it in order to taste anything. All was not lost though as the side of fresh potatoes chips was decent. Just had to dab it a few times with a napkin to get rid of the grease. If you're needing volume to refuel in the morning this is your place...but if you're more into tasty meals look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was dry and had no flavor. The seats are on top of each other, so hope you like your neighbor. The prices are high for the poor quality."}
{"text":"awesome breakfast hole right off I-15. Got in and out, with great service in less than 25 minutes. We recommend if you're passing through."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, and service. We lucked into this location on our way to ttitd and had to make sure to stop by on our way home. Have the Lobster Benedict. I did twice!  Update: I actually had it one more time on our way out of town. Three times!"}
{"text":"In Henderson/Las vegas for the monster jam finals and didn't want to spend big bucks on the Vegas strip. Read the good reviews and I thought I would give it a try. Went on a Saturday morning and wait was not bad. Food smelled delicious and taste even better."}
{"text":"This place was a GREAT find. Good service, good food for a great price. We forgot to ask for the 3 egg omelet their regular omelets are made with 6 eggs... yes I said 6 eggs. Either size they're good. We had the option of homemade banana or pumpkin bread instead of toast. Of course we took the option and went with the banana & pumpkin bread. We will definitely go back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"The kitchen sink omelet is great. And love the banana walnut bread too. The pancake is huge and personally I prefer it to be thinner. But overall great food and good service and good vibe. Nice traditional American breakfast place. :)"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast based on great Yelp reviews.  If you are lookimg for an old school breakfast place with great food and great service, this is the place for you.  Out server was Nick and the guy provided phenomenal service.  Omelettes were fantastic.  Will be back every time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved it! I gotta admit that from the outside I wasn't sure if this place was even open but we stopped by anyway and it was well worth it. The staff was super friendly, the service was quick amd the food was delicious.  We had a group of 8 people, everyone ordered something different and everyone enjoyed their food-even the picky ones :) I highly recommend going."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about going here,  do it.  The Omlette House is exactly what I'm looking for in a breakfast place.  I've been here at least 4 times within the last month.  Sometimes with a group, sometimes by myself. The first time I obviously had to get an omelette. They're enormous and extremely delicious. You can easily choose to split it with another and it's still more than enough food. The breakfast spuds are great and you have your choice of breads including banana nut and pumpkin with certain meals. I've yet to come for lunch but will sometime and update my review.  Recently, I've just been addicted to the country scrambler breakfast special. Comes with eggs,  ham, onion, mushroom, cheese, breakfast spuds and choice of bread for $6.99. I've had a few different servers, Jose has been great but they all are on top of their shit. When I go by myself I'm literally sat, finished eating, paid tab, and out the door within 15-25 minutes. Easily 5 stars."}
{"text":"Big servings and cheap prices. A huge list of of omelettes made with six eggs to make sure you are stuffed for the day."}
{"text":"Ordered cream cheese blueberry stuffed French toast. So good. Surprised by how many giant things they had on the menu if you wanted a gut-buster: 3 lb burger, 12 dozen egg omelet. Not for me, but could be fun. Servers were very friendly. Interacted and accommodated my toddler wonderfully."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to a place similar to a Denny's or iHop, but I love going to little family shops because they usually have better food. This place is by far the best breakfast I've ever had at a restaurant. The food is delicious and the portions are very generous. The prices are on point for what you get and the service is very friendly. I would even go as far to say that this was probably the best meal I had while I was in Vegas. Definitely coming back every time I'm here!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, huge portions and good service.  The Banana nut bread is the best I have ever had.  Reasonable prices.  Whenever I'm in las Vegas I make sure I have at least one breakfast there, hard to find anything better."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff, good breakfast food   I visited the Omelette House during a business trip in Henderson, NV. The breakfast was tasty and I'm told the coffee was hot and ready (though I didn't have any myself). Service was quick and the food was hot. I paid $11.34 (including tax, no tip) for on of their \"skillets\"and a glass of water. Seems a bit steep but all things considered I'd pay it again."}
{"text":"Overall:  Found this restaurant off of Yelp so decided to check it out. It's a family owned business serving typical diner style breakfast. Go here if you want hearty breakfast with great portions for the price, but be prepared to feel stuffed and a bit overwhelmed.   Ambiance/Location:  In the back of a strip mall, also a bit difficult to find (when you turn in, look on the back left of the parking lot). The inside is cute, with various curios on the walls and old pictures of famous people and their Best of Las Vegas articles (they won several years in the early 90's).   Food:  portions are HUGE (each omelet is made with 6 eggs, 4 if you downsize to the \"baby\" size). We ordered the \"kitchen sink\" which literally has everything in it from stew meat chunks and chili to bell peppers and onions. The lobster fest is filled with lobster, avocado, and cheese. Both tasted good, but were a bit overwhelming and heavy. (ie. if you are on any type of diet, you probably don't want to be here). Omelets are accompanied by potatoes cut like thick chips and deep fried, as well as a side of pumpkin bread, banana bread, toast, or English muffin. I highly recommend the pumpkin or banana bread which were hot, moist, hearty, and well-spiced. The pancakes were also pretty light and a bit more cake-y than others I've had. the syrup was thin and very sweet, not very flavorful.   Service:  friendly wait staff -- they recommended that we split an omelet between 2 people and were right (we didn't even finish)!   Price:  $9-11 per omelet, they didn't charge us the slit-plate fee of $0.95 so it is a great deal if you share.  $5.40 for 3 pancakes."}
{"text":"This place is located in a run down little strip mall and isn't much to look at from the outside. It's one of those places I would never have gone to unless someone had recommended it to me first. That would be Yelp, in this case. I'm glad I found it, though, because the breakfast here is great.  Their omelettes are gigantic! No one in my group was able to finish theirs. I had the Black Forrest omelette which had mushrooms, ham, and swiss. The eggs were perfect and the cheese was nice and melty. But it was just too big. I should have exercised the option to make it a \"baby omelette\" for $0.85 less. I had considered the option, but decided it would make me look like a wuss. I didn't want to order something off the menu with the word \"baby\" in it. That's worse than ordering off the kid's menu, as far as I'm concerned.  There's one thing that troubled me. There's one omelette on the menu called the \"Flatlanders Special.\" This is what it is word for word from the menu: Raw liver, parsnips, peanut butter, organically grown black jelly beans, sauteed grunion lips (2), gardenia petals, and topped with mint ice cream (Subject to when grunions are running). It costs $69. I don't know if it's for real or if it's some kind of joke. Thinking about it now, I'm really kind of curious about it.   That aside, this place is great. Definitely check it out when you're in town. Oh, and don't leave without trying the banana nut bread or the pumpkin bread. Or both."}
{"text":"This place is just as awesome as it was 11 years ago, when I use to ditch school to eat a late breakfast lol. Actually, the pumpkin bread and potatoes are even better than I remembered! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food. We brought our kids and were happy we did. Usually it's hard to eat anywhere with very young children, not here. We were seated right away, were given the option of a booth with a booster seat or a table with a high chair, the table has creamers and jams the children build with, there is a balloon animal person who can make fun balloon swords or Spiderman-shaped balloons, and the food comes fast (they bring the children's food out first, the parents food immediately afterwards too). The food is so fresh, we ordered a fruit cup for our youngest and were amazed at how vibrant and top quality the fruits were. We will definitely keep coming back :-)"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast...Never miss when I go to vegas....you would never ever expect seeing it from outside....like 45 different omelets to choose from...Great potates that come with omelets....great service...Hefty portions as much of animal that I am i never leave there Hungry!!! out of the way in little strip mall , totally worth it about 10 min drive from stratosphere...."}
{"text":"Just had the best chicken fried steak n eggs. really really good and the fried potatoes are to die for."}
{"text":"Large portions at a fair price. Fast friendly service. Had eggs and sausage. Enjoyable with huge side of potatoes. Enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"What's there to say more than great, attentive service, fresh, large,  great tasting portions (I do mean LARGE, so if you aren't famished, try the smaller version of the omeletes), friendly atmosphere,  fresh coffee,  huge omelete menu and very reasonable prices? If you want a good ol' American breakfast, this the place to go."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast at omelet house, I had the corned beef hash and banana bread, my daughter ordered an omelet it was huge could have ordered 1/2 size and it would have been plenty. We will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Truly one of the last original, local, family-owned breakfast secrets! If you've had your fill of the cookie-cutter, mediocre, chain-like, diner-style restaurants; and your craving some good food, personality, and kitch, then you have to check out the Omelet House.   Tucked away in an otherwise, run-down, and non-descript strip mall near UMC, the Omelet House has an extensive menu, just broad enough to please its rather large, & eclectic following.   Be prepared to wait a few minutes, although the restaurants multitude of seating areas seem to have branched off over the years into hidden hallways and secret garden rooms.  Basic good, hot coffee (complete with staff who seem solely dedicated to the task of keeping all the cups full) helps to keep your growling stomach at bay, while a comedically-described, fun list of deliciously tempting omelets ranging from the simple Southwestern to the brazen, 'Kitchen Sink' (comprised of who knows what), will only make you more hungry, as you toil away about what to order.  My recommendation is the Chorizo Omelet (there is some unspoken harmony between eggs & really good chorizo that I find irresistible), but for those of you calorie counters - just along to enjoy the scenery & conversation, you will be equally pleased by egg whites filled with whatever you like...  Arrive with an open-mind and an empty stomach and you're sure to have an interesting & tasty experience.  For the best people-watching, try a weekend if you don't mind a short wait; then, while you anxiously await your fluffy yellow taste of breakfast-heaven, entertain your eyes with all of the bizarre items that have been lovingly collected and hung on the walls around you - some of them even for sale!"}
{"text":"The best customer service EVER! My first time there I was very impressed. The food was delish, the staff was prompt,  very attentive and the overall environment was very pleasant and welcoming. Highly recommended it."}
{"text":"This is the place for breakfast. If you've heard of the omelet house then you know what your here for. If it becomes your first time, you won't go anywhere else. You said buffet, that's total nonsense! This place gives you a home cooked meal, without having to wash dishes. And don't let me forget to mention the banana nut bread, DELISH!!"}
{"text":"== Food ==  It's fantastic, but the standard options and portions are not for the health-conscious. The star menu items are, of course, the omelets, of which there are 34 to choose from, including quite a few unique combinations (lobster, shrimp, salmon, etc.) I've tried a few of them at this point and have left happy every time.  All breakfast items come with \"spuds\" (thinly sliced fried potatoes) and a choice of toast, english muffin, homemade bread or tortillas. You want to get the bread (Pumpkin Nut or Banana Nut, both are great). While the potatoes and rest of your meal will be tasty, I am sad for people who don't order one of the breads. You are truly missing out should you pass on it.  For the health conscious, you'll want to downgrade to a \"baby\" omelet, which would more accurately be named the \"adult human\" size. The standard omelet portion is more appropriate for horses or elephants. There are also options for splitting a dish, substituting a side for sliced banana or fruit cup and using egg beaters, egg whites or swiss/feta cheese, all for additional cost. The Omelet House has ways to make their offerings more healthy but it's going to cost extra.  There are also traditional American lunch items (sandwiches, hamburgers) but if you're visiting from out of town, stick with breakfast. The one exception might be the fried zucchini which is worth getting (but also terrible for you.)  == Environment ==  The folksy environment is a far cry from the glitz and glamour of the strip but it's an island of authenticity in what tends to be a sea of garish veneer during a trip to Las Vegas.  The place is tucked inside one of the hundreds of strip malls that make up most commercial districts within the city and seems to cater to a split of tourists and locals.  == Summary ==  As you can probably tell, I'm a huge fan of the Omelet House. The food alone is worth a 5-star rating, but the charges for all the healthier substitutes and the spotty wait staff (who range from extremely friendly to mildly contemptuous) docks a star.  That said, the Omelet House is a standard part of every trip I take to Vegas. The casinos can be cruel but giant omelets, fried potatoes and amazing bread never fail me.  If you're still reading at this point: you should go. Thank me later."}
{"text":"HUGE PORTIONS my Girlfriend and I always split there omlettes. Try the banana bread instead of the toast. Good prices for great quality."}
{"text":"Went there with a bunch of ppl. Got seated very quickly for abotu a party of 20 people which was kinda surprising. But this place was more like an Omelet Mansion the size of the place.   Reason for the deductions in stars was because a friend noticed there was actually a cockroach crawling all over his utensils. I alerted the waiter or whoever was helping out and didnt realyl get an acknowledgement that this was not right. We could've been asses and created more trouble, but we were there for a family function and didnt want the rest of family to be bothered if we changed venues.   A star is added due to the good service by the waitresses that handled us.   I'm sorry about the bad review, and I know sometimes as a business, things can be alittle out of their hands, but regardless, a cockroach was found and on the eating utensils and table.   HK's parting shot --  -- raid please."}
{"text":"Yesterday, took my family for breakfast. We started off with the infamous fried zucchini. OMG! They were absolutely delicious! If you like fried zucchini, this is a must! Each of our meals were exceptional, but Lola, our server, was a doll! She was delightful! Cannot wait to bring my family back when we return to Vegas."}

{"text":"Really cute breakfast place. My friend and I got the blueberry stuffed French toast special with eggs and a choice of sausage or bacon for $8.99. I really couldn't complain about anything. Our food was really good. It was my first time here. It's like a better Blueberry Hill. Only thing I could say is, I prefer to not see the chef eating as he's cooking my food. Lol. I know it happens. I work in a restaurant. Just saying I prefer not to see it. Other than that, food and service was great!"}
{"text":"This place has so much Las Vegas history.  It's so awesome to see how the city has evolved since the Elvis days with all the Photos on the wall.  Oh and the food? To die for.  Portions are huge and the price is right.  Definitely recommend this hidden Henderson gem."}
{"text":"Breakfast places tend to give a lot of food.  This is not good especially when you're trying to fit in as many places to eat in a limited amount of time.  What was ordered was the Country Style Scramble.  Scramble was moist.  Good ratio of ingredients.  Potatoes were like chips, overcooked chips.  They were too crispy and bitter.  I also chose the pumpkin nut bread which was good, moist, and not too sweet or heavy.  Overall, it was OK, they know how to cook eggs so that's a big plus but their \"Spuds\" were not enjoyable, only acceptable with a generous application of Cholula."}
{"text":"The hockey team Band of Brothers from USA and Canada thank all the great people and owners at the Omelet House. 16 Hungry players and their coach were all served 100% happiness and the food all came out at the same time and HOT.   We salute you."}
{"text":"Came here after reading they have fish and chips......Wrong!  Greeter said they cut them from the menu over a year ago. The rest of the menu looked good, but the wife craved fish and chips.  They sent us to the Omelet House on Russell Rd....well, they had 'em but they were catfish fish.....a no-go.  Wound up going to Miller's Alehouse on Sunset - Wonderful fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Omelet House was pretty good I have to say. Any omelet you choose is going to taste good but be aware that the portions are HUGE. So if you're a small person or don't have a big appetite - share.   Must have some banana bread. It comes out fresh and hot from the oven, so soft and moist. I would go there just to eat that.   I must say that driving up to Omelet House had me a little worried because from the outside it looks a little sketchy and even the decor on the inside is kinda iffy but I guess that doesn't matter when the food comes out. Service was friendly also."}
{"text":"Don't let the outer appearance fool you the service is great the food is wonderful and you'll leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"I love the food here.. but perhaps more importantly... It is obvious that they care about what they are doing here. Every time I come here I am a bit put off by the fact that the parking lot is completely full, and there is a line snaking nearly around the building. This looks like a 45 minute wait...  Until I remember : these people are good at what they do... And no matter how it looks.. youre about 10 minutes from being seated.  I wish every resturant operated with this level of efficiency.  Great food Great service And dont leave until you try the banana bread!"}
{"text":"Any Place with corned beef hash gets 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place by accident several years ago while in Vegas.  We were driving around looking for some place to eat breakfast and it finally got to the point of JUST FIND SOMETHING NOW I'M STARVING. And that's when the Omelet House sign appeared out of nowhere.  This is my favorite place to have breakfast EVER.  Great good, friendly staff, great food, huge portions, great food.  I have never been disappointed yet.  I wish we had a Omelet House in Phoenix !!!!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is a must to go to when your in Las Vegas. Food is delicious, potatoes are the bomb. The workers are welcoming and make sure you are taken care of. The portions and price is also good."}
{"text":"Just happened by and what luck! It's everything they say! The food was excellent and the service prompt and friendly.Love the decor- kitschy but clean. Huge omelets (should've shared!)"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of this resteraunt fool you!  The food here is awesome!  I had the 38 special omelet and LOVED it!  The banana bread is good too. The service was ok. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I tried the new 'chicken fried steak' omelette, it was so good I have to go back again soon.  This place is great on service, food and comfort."}
{"text":"3.5* We enjoyed the diner ambiance and welcoming service.  Perhaps I'm just not a fan of greasy spoon food.  The lobster benedict was tasty and certainly a generous portion with lots of avocado and lobster meat, but the eggs were fried instead of poached and the hollandaise didn't taste like the usual buttery goodness, perhaps they don't use much of it?"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since it's around the corner from where my boyfriend lives. The quality and service was on par with Denny's. In other words I've had better."}
{"text":"I think their omelets are totally delicious, but their potatoes are not my fav. I wish they had another choice of potatoes, like hashbrowns. The portions are huge and I always take home left overs."}
{"text":"We went here twice with friends on a recent trip to Vegas.  Clean, cute place with great food.  Use your GPS or you'll miss it!  Everything we had was great!  My friend said it was the BEST pastrami he has ever had, even in NYC delis. We had our coffee refilled numerous times without asking.  The place was very clean.  We will be back next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"whenever i visit my friend in vegas, we grab breakfast here.  good food and great service.  today i had the sausage patties and eggs with a bowl of chicken noodle soup.  the soup was a little salty, but it still hit the spot.  the pumpkin bread is freakin awesome!  this is a must have to compliment your breakfast.  two of my friends ordered the lobster eggs benedict and it looked good.  lots of lobster chunks and covered in sauce."}
{"text":"We were here a few mornings ago and it was the best! Their omeletes were delicious! I had the chorizo omelet (scrambled version) and it was the best! It was flavorful and had the slightest kick to it. All the servers were super nice and welcoming. The place it's self had a nice old charm feel. They had a ton of knick-knacks and autographs from famous persons who have eaten there! President Clinton had eaten there! Their potatoes were amazing! Great for a hangover cure. They were fast, even while being packed. Definitely give this place a try, you will not regret it! Wish we had came back the following morning."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Not sure if I still like their food as I never received my correct order. Took about 15 minutes for out waitress to even acknowledge we were there. Messed up on my order. It took forever for it to be remade. Asked if it could be to go. Well to go order was still incorrect.  Never refilled our drinks. Upon looking at ticket we could see that the order was put in wrong. And the whole time the waitress made it seem like it wasn't her fault. Terrible service. I work on the strip and when people ask for something different to eat I recommend omelet house. I will never be doing that again. Overall horrible experience."}
{"text":"I was referred to this place by a coworker who has been coming here for breakfast every Saturday morning with his wife for the past 5 years.   This place has a very old school diner look and is located in one of the older neighborhoods off of Lake Mead Blvd. in Henderson. The menu has a lot to offer and has a lot to choose from. My first visit I ordered the corned beef hash which comes with your choice of bread, two eggs, and potatoes. For my bread I tried the pumpkin spice bread which came out nice and hot smothered with butter. The corned beef hash was cooked perfect, thick slices of shredded beef cooked on the flat grill giving it a little crust making some parts nice and crunchy. Now I'm a big texture guy and the corned beef had the perfect texture combination of tender beef with a little crunch. The potatoes were awesome too. Now these were not your regular breakfast potatoes, they were sort of like thick potato chips with some pieces crunchy and some cooked nice and soft. They're also not skimpy on their portions here.   The staff was very friendly and very welcoming. My cup of coffee never hit half.  The waitresses look like they've worked here for years but enjoy every minute of their work.   I recommend coming early on the weekends because this place tends to get crowded quick.   This place was so good I came back again that same week!"}
{"text":"First timer. We walked in, the hostess' were occupied with counting their tips or something, didn't even greet us, not till another worker came out and asked if we've been helped.  Our waiter was a lot more attentive to us, which I'm thankful for; he explained the menu and was very prompt in taking our order. The food was very filling. Well worth the price."}
{"text":"Food OK service needs improvement my server took my order wrong and did not check until the end"}
{"text":"After so many great reviews, I was really looking forward to a good breakfast.  But, I will never return and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  The service was extremely slow (with NO apology; and a joke about having to wait a \"Mexican minute\"...which, apparently, is longer than 60 seconds) even though there were only 4 tables occupied (family of four, two at my table and two other tables with only ONE person)!  Four tables and a total of 8 customers!  Really?  Our country scrambler breakfast was cold, the \"melted\" cheese had turned hard again.  The \"spuds\" (homemade, thick-cut potato chips) were deep fried, hard and greasy.  They tasted as if the oil needed to be changed/cleaned about a month ago.  I wish I could say anything good about this experience; but I really can't.  We didn't even eat our meals; but were charged full price.  No one seemed to care if the meal was eaten or enjoyed.  Don't waste your time, money or taste buds.  I can't think of a worse breakfast in my life.  Sorry; the entire experience was terrible. Go down the street and eat a great breakfast at Joker's Wild Casino for $2.49 (that's what we had to do!)."}
{"text":"A pseudo-vegetarian POV:  Pluses: our server was really sweet and accommodating, no wait in line on a Monday lunch hour, lots of options for the ovo-lacto. I liked my guac omelet (just the right amt of spice), and Boyfriend got the spinach one. He wishes he got the artichoke one because it was pretty standard, BUT both of our omelets were well-filled w/ ingredients. They use real butter on their toast, too, yay! (Dont' start on me as to why I didn't get their famous bread, grrr)  Minuses: parking was surprisingly full. We had to circle twice before finding parking. Their coffee wasn't to my liking, but if you like your coffee really thin and watery (like my mom does) you won't mind it.  Other: the decor reminded me of stopping at one of those random places off the 5 on your way down to L.A., but in a good way. Lots of junk to look at on the walls, and try to get a booth.  Can't speak for the rest of the menu, but I would definitely come back...esp after a night of drinking a grip of champagne (groan)."}
{"text":"Try taking one for two persons, or you'll \"suffer\" from huge portions of this delicious everything! I warned you! And banana bread is awesome"}
{"text":"I've been here a fee times. One of my favorite places to eat. All three locations have great food and for the most part great service. This morning however, I had a very bad customer service experience. When we walked in, we were seated immediately. That was amazing. Waited on just as fast. Went up to the counter to check out and asked to have our check split. The cashier Jenny was extremely RUDE! Her comment was \" you obviously didn't read the sign\". The sign read , let your server know if you would like split checks prior to ordering. We were seated right away and didn't get a chance to see the small 8x11 sign. Then she was very RUDE when she asked how we wanted pt split it. Rolled her eyes on at least three occasions! I won't be going to that location anytime soon. Thanks Jenny for ruining one if my favorite spots. Thankfully there are other locations!"}
{"text":"This was my first restaurant I ate at when I bought my house here at Lake Las Vegas it is a true locals place they give you way too much suggest sharing with your buddy  It has  a great atmosphere too.  what else more can I say first class ,,,thanks very much for being a very positive influence on me and my first day living in Las Vegas thanks"}
{"text":"My kids and I went to The Omelet House for the first time.  We placed an order to go. It was the best service I have ever received.  The cashier went above and beyond.  We ordered drinks while we waited and she even offered refills.  They gave us everything we could possibly want, crackers for the soup, butter for the bread. It was amazing food.  My biscuit was flaky and delicious, my son said his burger was the best he has ever had.  We will definitely be making this a weekly thing."}
{"text":"This is a fun, old-fashioned American-style diner that is priced very reasonably for the *huge* portions served. Come hungry or be prepared to share food, because there is a lot of it! Everything, though -- service, food, atmosphere -- was great. We'll be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome omelets and their menu is pretty big to satisfy anybodies hunger"}
{"text":"5 stars for their service and food! Plenty of seating for those who are waiting to be seated to their table. Had a very friendly waitress who was on top of everything. And very generously sized omelets! Been here a few times and over had the lobster omelet which is a must and I've had the country fried steak because it's a must for me at any breakfast restaurant I go to, which could have been better had it not been so salty and as breaded as it was, but still was okay. Also tried their mocha, which they serve in a large glass without ice and give you ice in a separate cup too add yourself just to make sure it's not watered down as you drink it."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! So glad I tried this little hole in the wall. It is decorated in 70s theme but I think thats because its been open since then! It gives the homey kinda feeling. I have only had breakfast here but there lunch menu looks good too."}
{"text":"4 stars: Yay! I'm a fan.  In the past, I'd always ask if the grunion were running, but lately, it seems some of the waitstaff isn't as familiar with the menu as I am, so I've kind of stopped asking.   The potatoes here are excellent.   If you transplanted them to just about any low/mid 20s zagat-rated steakhouse, you'd be paying between $7 to $12 bucks for these cottage fries. Really, really nice potatoes. I prefer them to the $7 fries at Bouchon. Dead serious.   The banana bread is good, be sure to have some when it's available. The pumpkin nut bread is pretty good as well.  I like to order the breakfast sandwich, which is essentially a BLT + fried egg, or more economically, breakfast bacon sandwich with a side of lettuce and tomato instead of the cheese.   The omelets are all pretty large. Depending on your ability to put away a 6 egg omelet you may be pleased or intimidated when you see it in front of you.   The lobster benedict that a lot of reviewers rave about isn't as good as you would imagine. Something isn't quite right with the lobster or the Hollandaise. It's not their best menu item, and there's so many other things to eat here, I'd skip it.  I've been eating here for a very long time, and I have always found the service to be personable and relatively quick. However, I avoid this place on weekends.   I am told that weekends can be quite hectic at peak breakfast hours.  Also, they aren't really open very early for a breakfast spot (7am), so it's not exactly a place for early birds or night owls looking to grab a late post-afterhours meal.  It's an affordable place to eat north of the strip. It isn't the best breakfast spot in the world, but it does the trick about 96% of the time, so it's a solid 4-star place for me, and one of the few staples on my reliable vegas eats list.  Multiple locations, but the one on Charleston is the one I tend to gravitate towards."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little omelet house. I came here once so far but I plan on coming back many times. I love their big Belgian Waffles!"}
{"text":"This is definitely our go to spot for breakfast or brunch.  Staff is always friendly. Food portions are gigantic and well worth the prices!!!  We eat off of it for days!  Must order....homemade fried zucchini!!!  None of that pre made frozen stuff here.  Yummy pumpkin bread and ask for extra crispy spuds.  Brought the kids here. They love it too.   Order #33 1/2.   It's awesome!!!  Lol."}
{"text":"The portions are huge. Excellent portion size and the food is good too. Comparing this to places such as iHop, this is much better. I definitely recommend if you want a good fill."}
{"text":"This place is a must go if you are craving breakfast food! The stuffed French toast was so good and the biscuits and gravy were incredible!"}
{"text":"Always great food and service.  Very happy to get you exactly what you want."}
{"text":"Great variety of omelettes.  Large portions and delicious. I had the green chili and pork omelette.  The warm freshly baked banana bread and home fries that came with it were awesome.  My daughter had the chocolate chip pancakes.  Two huge pancakes over stuffed with chips.  This is more of an egg place than a pancake place. Decor is old but quaint.  Given the portions it is reasonably priced. Recommended."}
{"text":"Glad we found this place. There was a bit of a line, but it moves pretty quickly. I had the baby sized petunia pig with bacon and cheddar, which I substituted for American and my husband had the Plymouth rock which had turkey, avocado, Jack cheese and tomato . They omlets come with potato chips and you get a choice of toast, pumpkin bread or banana nut bread. We chose toast. It was super saturated with butter, but it was yum. The chips were crispy and had a nice flavor to them. The omlets are huge! Even the baby sized, which is $1 cheaper is big. Overall, loved it."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for breakfast the other day. We had been to The Omelet House a few years ago and decided to go again. I am not a big breakfast person so I decided to have the Grilled Ham & Cheese sandwich. My wife ordered one of their six egg omelets. My sandwich was very tasty. I did also enjoy the potatoes that came with it. They are sliced like potato chips, but not cooked to a hard crunch. They are soft and crunchy at the same time. My wife said her omelet was quite tasty as well.  I am sorry to say that in the long run I was not very impressed. When we arrived we waited to be seated a good three to five minutes. The restaurant was only about half full at the time. Once seated we also had to wait to have anyone come by and get our drink order. That was almost ten minutes. I don't know what kind of tea they serve, but my tea had a strange taste to it. My wife ordered sourdough toast with her omelet. When it arrived I was drenched in margarine to the point she had to send it back and ask for it dry. My sandwich, even though tasty, was priced way too high. The slices of bread were not very big, the ham was not very thick and the cost was close to eight dollars.  I have to say that our server was friendly and did the best she could. The food was pretty good but overpriced. All in all it is just an ok place to go. I can't say about the other locations. I ate at the Charleston location. Maybe the others are better."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a place to eat on yelp when your in Vagas because everything comes up.  So use your filter wisely and you will find this place-the omelet house.  Dont let the outsode fool you...the place is very inviting and the wait times are short.  The staff are have the best customer service that I have seen in a long time...seam well know by locals.  Very attentive staff never make you feel as if your forgotten (they even p pick up your straw wrappers while your eating...great service can't say enough about it).  Where our seats were I could see the kitchen and it looked clean.  The food- food is great the banana bread that I saw in many pics was well worth it comes out hot and taste home made.  Our food took a little time to come out, but I've learned that means that they are probably actually cooking it (as I typed this our food came lol).  The food was great, you will not be disappointed.  The taste and flavors are good as well as the portions.  We will come back here for breakfast when in town."}
{"text":"Good, good, good, did I say good \"comfort/home style\" food.  The service is great, too. The entire service staff was smiling and friendly.  Thanks once again,  fellow Yelpers for helping me  find me another keeper! I had the lobster omelet, loaded with  fresh, not fishy tasting meat, and plenty of it. Nice gooey cheese and very fresh avocado stuffed inside, too.  Mmmmmm. Better, (larger,) and fresher tasting lobster omelet than at many New England diners where I eat regularly! I chose the banana bread as the side. A huge piece came out, oven fresh, ahead of my entree. Mmmm mmm.  And what can I say about the spuds. Wow, home style potato chips hot and fresh. Not greasy at all, and seasoned just right.  Another plus, nothing was over salted. That drives me crazy. More restauranteurs should cut the salt and let the customer decide, like they do here.  Coffee came regularly and my cup was never less than half empty when refills were offered,  (By virtually every server that came past. What a team!) so my cup was always hot. How nice.  If you leave hungry or feeling under appreciated, you need a diet and an attitude adjustment.  I'll come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My go to breakfast joint! The portions are huge, the staff are great and everything is made in house.  I usually get their corned beef hash and eggs but got the eggs Benedict the last trip and was so happy I did. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the hollandaise was made in house and it came with their famous spuds that were cooked crispy like I like. Did the spuds in the sauce--so good. I have yet to have anything bad here and I have ordered both breakfast and lunch items. They are my second favorite place to get fried zucchini and it comes with ranch and cheese sauce.   If you don't want fast food or foo foo la la food, go to the omelet house for a good, hearty meal. Will remind you of the kind of food your grandma made."}
{"text":"Very down to earth, original looking diner. Classic diner decor. Banana bread was very moist and fresh. I got the ms. Eve (omelette with Apple and cinnamon, it was very different which is why I got it. Very fresh and was good, fluffy and cheesy. I could only eat half it was so big. The hash browns\potato chips as the side were homemade but not very good. The other person I was with got a cheese tomato and onion omelette  and said it was one of the best omelette they have had. I would go again."}
{"text":"We visited Vegas for a week, and found this great place 5 days into our visit.  Wish we had found it sooner.  The portions are generous, and the food delicious.  I highly recommend the chilli verde omelet.   Sooo yummy!  Kids had the stuffed french toast, and hubby had the carnitas omelet.  Everyone was happy with their meal and will return when we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food, seasoned just right. Great service even though we came 45 minutes before closing on a weekend day! I had an omelette and hubby had the BLT. Pumpkin bread is the bomb."}
{"text":"The chicken club sandwich was really , good the chicken was cooked to perfection and was juicy and fresh. One of the best places I have tried while on my visit to Vegas . Really recommend trying it"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! Perfect combination of savory dishes and macro friendly dishes as well! Great family owned business and Kathy is amazing!! Ask for her to be your server!"}
{"text":"Was in town for bike week had heard good things about this place so I was looking forward to my breakfast. To bad I was dissapointed. had the black forest omlete. It was like any other omlete and the potatpoes whats up with that ? Hash browns or country potatoes only . Save the chips for lunch!"}
{"text":"Was looking for breakfast places while I was in Las Vegas and I ran across all the reviews and decided to try it out.  We went before 9:30 a.m. so we were able to be seated immediately. However, shortly after there was a wait to be seated so we got there just at the right time.  Ordered the petunia pig omelet (bacon and cheese) but had them add sausage. They had about 25 (I think) kinds of omelets you could order.  The omelet also came with toast and \"spuds\" which were fresh cut potatoes that were deep fried.  Very Good!!  Omelet was delicious. They definately don't skimp on the ingredients in fact I don't know how they make money with how much they give you.  If you are hungry try this place out!  Omelets ran about $8.00.  If you aren't in the mood for omelets they also had pancakes, french toast and other assorted breakfast you would normally eat.  I also noticed that they had a big lunch menu too.  So ff you are hungry try this place out!  Would definately go back when we come back to Henderson in the future."}
{"text":"Typical diner set up in restaurant.  Good for breakfast definitely.  Great service very friendly.  Omelets are huge.  Buds are more like potato chips. I did not care for them but I know they are a popular menu item.  Banana bread is very good."}
{"text":"First time at the omlet house. I instantly got seated once I arrived but unfortunately it took 20-25 just to get served a drink, then another 20 mins to get my order taken. For me to not be from las Vegas eating at this location the customer service is HORRIBLE! THE Food is okay but I'll definitely recommend take out just sitting there will cause you to loose your appetite just by waiting."}
{"text":"The service was awesome the food was awesome. We highly recommend it. Busy holiday weekend the place was packed and the service was still awesome."}
{"text":"Wow...this place sure has gone downhill! They cut back their hours and now close at 3pm during the week? They got rid of their salad bar? My wife and I ate dinner here on 3/8. I ordered a small house salad and the meatloaf w/mashed potatoes and corn. The salad was a portion of cabbage w/ a slice of not very ripe tomato. It's a good thing I added ranch to make it somewhat palatable. I didn't finish it. The best part of my dinner was the corn. I got the feeling that this place wasn't doing very well so they're cutting back wherever they can. This used to be a decent place when they first opened. I hope this location serves a better breakfast or they might as well close for business. With tip, I spent $27 for dinner for 2. I should've gone to Mimi's."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here before our drive home from Vegas. The food was sooo good, and I never had to ask for a coffee refill. Perfection.  Might I suggest the eggs benedict and also their waffles! The breakfast potato chips are way better than I anticipated."}
{"text":"Loved it! It looks scary on the outside, but is worth venturing inside. Coffee was fantastic; huge portions; great service! Definitely get the banana bread!"}
{"text":"Great service great food!  Thank you Amber for the recommendations your service was amazing. We will be back soon"}
{"text":"This place was great.  HUGE portions.  Great coffee.  Took some of the suggestions of reviews on here. Get the homemade pumpkin bread. I had the corned beef hash and it was very tasty.  Apparently they do the corned beef themselves.  My boyfriend had the cowboy special omelette (with chili in it).  He was happy with his food as well. On a whim we got the fried zucchini.  You must try it.  We came back the next day and ordered it to go on our way out of town.  Mmmmm greasy goodness."}
{"text":"Delicious home made potato chips!  Our party also ordered the philly cheese steak omelet which was wonderful, and the waffles were cooked to perfection.  Service was great, too!"}
{"text":"Amazing and fast service!! We were seated immediately and we went during a busy Sunday so I was kind of shocked"}
{"text":"The reviews were so high I was expecting a delicious breakfast.  I was disappointed.  What they call \"spuds\" are mushy oily thick potato chips.  I had the eggs benedict and I swear they made the hollandaise sauce with corn starch. There is plenty to eat, only what there is isn't good. IHOP may get only an average of 3 stars, but at least they know how to make hash browns. Their bacon is nothing to brag about either. Pancake House beats them by a mile. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast spot. If you are looking to get off of the strip and find a place where the locals go--this is your spot.  Plus you'll save some money compared to those casino hotel prices. Give it a try-you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Super meh. I don't see what the big deal is about this place. Other reviewers wrote glowing reviews, and that's why I decided to try it out, but this is shockingly poor compared to my expectations. Maybe 30 years ago, when vegas was in the middle of a literal desert, this food was considered better than average. Today it's dated, the food is bland, and the menu is whatevs. Or maybe people from podunk parts of America aren't accustomed to good breakfast places and equate big with delicious. Everything we ordered was bland, the potatoes are basically potato chips, and everything is sticky. Portions are big, but you're getting more of the same blah food, so who cares? Do yourself a favor and go to one of the other incredible breakfast spots on the strip."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! From the homemade banana bread to the corned beef to the stuffed French toast... Sooooooo good! We will definitely be coming back next time we are on Vegas!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for Breakfast!  Returned 2 days in a row to be served by Kathy..the most awesome server!  From Lobster Benedict to Lobster Omlette to almost 30 other omlettes, the stuffed french toast and homemade corned beef hash..its all excellent!  Homemade Pumpkin and Banana breads are the icing on the cake!  Best breakfast value in Las Vegas all for less than $12 per 6 egg Omlette which can be shared!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast while in town. Great, friendly service. Food was good. They have a bunch of omelet options. I ended up with the bacon and eggs and sourdough toast which was good.  Not a bad place to grab some breakfast at a reasonable price and great service."}
{"text":"You have to try the lobster omellette. Its awesome. Dont love the potatoes much. Great consistency and always a friendly down home staff. Huge portions and a great home town but"}
{"text":"Ok, I think we've found our new breakfast spot. Service was beyond excellent..very quick and friendly. Had the corned beef hash, and yes it IS homemade as advertised. Wife had a veggie omelet and said it was good. And she's a picky Eater. Will definitely being going back."}
{"text":"I'm simply speaking of it's name sake for now.  And the small 3 egg versions.  Been twice now.  Best breakfast in town in my opinion. Reasonably priced also! Gotta go with ones gut feeling. My gut says, perfect eggs, love the tatoes, and the Pumpkin, or whatever that other heated cube of breads they offer. YUM!!  I'll still shop around town.  But I found me a real strong contender if not winner!  Certainly on those weekday morns. Weekends safe to say, Crowded.  Haven't had their coffee yet due to starting at home first. Got's to try the Joe.  Save me that table by the window please."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and hamburgers in Henderson. I have been going there for years. We love the food and staff.  Go during the weekdays and order the pork chili burrito. Anyone can find something they love at Omelet House. When ever we have company from out of town this is where I take them for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I had to wait for tires to b put on wifes truck, so I decided to have brunch at omelette house it was next door. It's been a few years since I ate here last don't remember it being this good . I had the corn beef hash with eggs and potatoes. The corn beef had good flavor and very tender. The potato's were like a thick cut, potato chip. Very crisp and different from   plain jane hash browns or country potato's. Portion size was good . I won't wait too long to return."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, healthy portions, speedy service. What more can I say. I had the Greek omelet and the oh so decadent banana bread. Hubs had pancakes and bacon. Our waitress was very sweet and never let our coffee cups get empty. All the carefully placed knick knacks lent to the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot if I'm in the mood for omelet's.  The staff is friendly they refill your coffee all the time with out asking.  Portions are huge! My wife and I almost always end up sharing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Service is fast and friendly. Tuna melt is nirvana. New Jersey needs to learn how to make these. Dinner at NOBU and Giada's and my tuna melt outshines both   Megan our server warm, friendly, great smile and laugh."}
{"text":"Awesome food, and the portions are enormous! Service is outstanding. Will become a Vegas tradition when visiting. Laura was our server, and she was great."}
{"text":"We eat at the Omelet House every time we are in Las Vegas. They have SO many choices it is almost overwhelming. The food is excellent and I LOVE the hot pumpkin muffins!!!  It is located in a strip mall area of Vegas, but there is always a line, and that is a very good sign.   The first time we ate here we stumbled on to the place and decided it had to be good if the line was so long.  We talked with several people in line and about 90% of them were locals....also a very good sign.  Excellent breakfast and a nice break from the action of the strip."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! This place rocks! Excellent service, food is amazing!!! Definitely recommend this place and put my SIGNATURE of approval anywhere anytime. I will be back for more on my next visit to LV."}
{"text":"If this restaurant  was closer to my house , i would come here more offten , the portions are huge. jus the way i like it. I had the chorizo omelet with chedder. I skipped the potato and had  a side of tomato instead :( dam diet. I had the potatos before and they are great ,cut a little thicker then chips.  The country fried steak looked good, i think i might try that next time. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Best service and food the staff was amazing Amy serviced us 2 different times thank you"}
{"text":"I came here because I was staying at Siena Suites across the street and that gave me a 15% discount. I had no idea what to expect, read nothing, saw nothing, but by the end I realized I'd just found an amazing place to eat, and I'd come with a mostly full stomach!  I felt horribly guilty leaving behind a lot of my food but I knew it wouldn't survive the trip back to LA, that said the portions were HUGE. This is an all day omelett! I didn't even get an omelett though, my girl did, but I got the chicken fried steak which I told her while we were there, was the BEST one I'd ever had. And I've had a good 10-15 different varietys. It was just the perfect flavor to me. The pumpkin bread was bomb too.  Everyone here was also super friendly, no one made a fuss about getting the discount, overall a great experience.  So I was going to write this 5 star review anyway, but here's what made up my mind to post it ASAP. I left my debit hard here! Ugh! So I drove all the way down to Baker, California before realizing this. I called and they let me know I'd left it, and I asked if they could mail it to me and they said yes! You have no idea how delighted that made me, there was no way I could've driven back so one less card to cancel and re-order makes my life way easier. Like I said, 5 stars anyway, but because of that there's no way I can't return the favor and spread around the karma a little bit, because it's not like I told them I'm a yelper or anything!   Just genuine good people with genuine good food, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Comfortable country eatery with tasty dishes that easily satisfies an enormous appetite.   Lisa had a chili omelet where the chili was easily championship quality. I had a turkey club omelet that far exceeded my own expectation.   The special treat is they make their own potato chips that they use in place of hash browns or home fried potatoes. They were delicious.   Very happy (and full) campers are we."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Las Vegas celebrating our one year wedding anniversary and he loves trying new breakfast restaurants.  So we came across Omelet House it's hidden in a little shopping center with old memorabilia and a woodsy rustic feel.  They have so many options of omelets to choose from and the service was AH-MAZING! Our server was Amanda she never let our coffee or  water drop below half way.  This will definitely be one of our go to breakfast spots  when we visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch.  They were busy, but the wait was only 5 mins or so. Staff is very efficient and attentive. I had the Popeye omelet which was good.  Nice portions.  I also had the pumpkin bread, which was very tasty and moist... and then a side order of the blueberry stuffed French toast.  That was quite awesome! Good, solid place."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!  Delicious pumpkin bread, fresh corn beef hash, and those house potatoes!!! YUMMY. .. Oh, and being a southern girl. ...good biscuits are hard to come by...but Omelette House nailed them! My new fav breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Friendly, welcoming and good food. Visited another location a few years ago but today we visited the original. Something special about people who,love what they do and do it well. A++"}
{"text":"Come here if you are hungry!  We received great and attentive service.  Loved the corn beef hash and pumpkin bread."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the omelet house in years. When we arrived we were greeted by a man that I assume is the owner because he said that the UNLV diploma hanging in the wall was his. He was very nice and sat us immediately. Our waitress was very attentive. The pumpkin bread was delicious as always and our omelets were very tasty. We will returning again."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service.  You will probably need to take leftovers home because the portion sizes are big.  Forget the toast....order the banana bread."}
{"text":"Awesome cowboy omelet!!! And as others have said the banana nut and pumpkin breads are amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent in every possible way.  Make sure you are very, very hungry! Its a lot of delicious food.  Check out menu item # 33 1/2 (lol)"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Our server was very friendly and didn't forget a thing. Will definately be going back"}
{"text":"Spuds=yum. Banana bread=tasty.  Will be back."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and on top of their game. The food is so good, I want to move there just to be able to be a regular. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst breakfast place ever. I used to live right next to it and gave it several chances. Every time I got an omelette the veggies would still be hard and raw. i got huevos rancheros which you could tell the sauce was canned and awful. maybe even old who knows. So far everything I have tasted is disgusting. This place is so gross. Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"The service is supreme. And the food divine. The pumpkin bread is amazing and a delight."}
{"text":"The Omelet  House in Henderson  cooks breakfast so close to what my mom makes. I absolutely love the waffles. The servings are ginormous!  Don't forget to get the California  Omelet.  FRESH!FRESH!FRESH!"}
{"text":"I don't go to Vegas a lot but next time I'll make a point to go back to the Omelet House  The food was great and service was excellent  So much to choose from there's something for everyone  Coming from Hawaii I wanted something different so had the chili verde omelet (delicious) with banana bread (awesome I had two) Guess I gotta get back there again"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best Eggs Benedict you've ever tasted you found the right place the hollandaise sauce is second to none, friendly staff great service food is always delicious no matter what you order I highly recommend them"}
{"text":"Great place-we were lucky to find it on our one week stay. Will be back every morning. The pumpkin nut bread is to die for. Waitresses nice and fast. Food wonderful and very reasonably priced. Thanks Omelet House. Would definitely recommend for breakfast without hesitation."}
{"text":"Best apple & cream cheese stuffed french toast!!!! Feels like an old fashioned diner/cafe. Their whole menu is amazing..."}
{"text":"I will never come to Vegas again without stopping here. I fell in love with our waitress who also gave us some great tips on sight seeing in Vegas. The meal was even better than the service. Bacon cooked just as I asked and pancakes were light and fluffy. On our 8 day trip this was the best meal we had from Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada.  On top of all that the atmosphere was reminiscent of old school rat pack Vegas. I could just imagine those guys having breakfast there in the back room.  You will not regret this stop well off the strip."}
{"text":"Everything was delicous!  Quick and friendly service with good coffee and hot eats :D  The fresh banana bread alone is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Order egg Benedict lobster, waffles special, pumpkin & banana nut bread. Food was good.  Love the atmosphere. Friendly & nice. Our server, Lola was great & nice to us"}
{"text":"You will not believe the portions you get!  This was the best breakfast I've had in a long time!  The service was incredible!  These people make it about you - from quality to price to service. They are wonderful!  We will definitely be back every chance we get!  Everything was so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the corned beef hash.... Not greasy and just the right amount. The breakfast potatoes were also yummy and not greasy either. A friend got the lobster fest omelet and there was  plenty of lobster but kind of over the top with the egg.... Maybe the baby omelet would've balanced out the lobster better. Tasty though with the avocado. The pumpkin nut bread was yummy served warm! All priced right....Worth the drive from North Las Vegas since there is nothing much out there!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, it was totally accidental- typed in the GPS that I wanted food and bam, first thing that showed up. The second time was not so acccidental, although I did end up at the other place... THERE ARE TWO LOCATIONS! The Charleston one is super busy all the time with little parking, so take a little longer drive and go to the other one! (:  Food wise, its as good as it gets. I got the Californian omelette- perfect for Avocado lovers like myself. The specials are good too-pork chop/steak. My friend got the lobster omelette, which he raved to be really good if you like seafood. Be sure to get the pumpkin bread with your food, its very moist and warm and delicious! I was so tempted by buy a loaf of that amazingness.  And the servings are HUGE. The lady said six eggs are used, that added with your toppings = leftovers or a really full tummy!"}
{"text":"I've dined at this restaurant multiple times and I must say the food comes to the table in a timely manner and overall service is great except this dark cloud I noticed approaching my table. She goes by the name of Old Lady Susan.. Mannn my heart dropped when I come to realize she was my server once again.. My past experience about a month prior to this date.. She made mistakes on my tables order and just had an old lady grouch to her demeanor. I didn't ask to change sections for a new server. I believe in giving second chances but yet another awful experience.. I must say this place is great when Old Lady Susan isn't around to bring in the dark clouds."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and have liked there food.  We went yesterday for lunch and was very disappointed.  Do not get the fried zucchini.... horrible! Spuds are gross too.  Nothing special at lunchtime.  Cracked egg is way better and so is egg and I.  The service was not good either.  Maybe they were just having a bad day I don't know.  But we will not go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had a waffle and the syrup was not your average maple. It almost tasted like it had cherry or almond extract. It was a pleasant surprise. My husband had \"The Californian\" omlet and loved it. It was HUGE!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing food! Lots of work went into the \"kitchen Sink\" omelet. The banana bread was warm and delicious, too! And our waitress was super cute! #Casandra"}
{"text":"One of the best places to go grab breakfast at a sit down restaurant in old henderson. I would suggest this place to anyone! Large plates, great people. Awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Once was not enough so we went back twice and would love to open one up in Dallas. Good service, lots of goooooood food and top it of with your choice of sweets. We will be going back on our next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing Service, the hostess Loni was a pleasure. The waitresses all were friendly. Our coffee never got low. The six egg omelets were great if that is too much you can order a three egg(baby) omelet. Instead of toast you can order a piece of homemade pumpkin bread or banana bread. No hash browns but the do have a good potato chip style potato. A great new breakfast place in vegas."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was even better! Our waitress was so attentive and everyone was helpful and so nice with our 4 kids!  Best breakfast experience we've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast at the Omelet House a couple days ago. My husband and I loved it.  Very homey and cozy. The food was good and tasty.  We'll definitely visit again...we are from Southern California.."}
{"text":"Have been here for breakfast a handful of times, and I always order the same thing. Corned beef hash (which they do really well here), basted eggs, and a side order of a waffle. I have yet to try an omelet, as I've seen the ones my husband's ordered and they are enormous. My kids like to share a pancake breakfast which is plenty as well. My only real gripe with this restaurant is their knives. They are useless, aside from spreading butter. Try cutting pancakes with them? Better off ripping them with your own two hands.   *Wish they offered served alcohol here. Something about having a champagne, or a Bloody Mary on the weekend that just feels right."}
{"text":"We randomly got on yelp to locate a reasonably priced restaurant before going to the strip where everything is expensive. Even when it's expensive, quality is compromise but not this place. We have to walk in and right after us a line formed and apparently the owner was busy trying to find seating for everyone and his hospitality was wonderful. He truly cared about us and every person that came through the door waiting for a seat. After waiting only a few minutes we were quickly seated and our second \"wow\" factor happened. The food as far as quality, taste, portion size was on speakable!! Everything was just wonderful!! Way above our expectations. The waitress was quick and very pleasant. The overall hospitality was impeccable. I highly recommend this place for breakfast and lunch. The prices are great for what you get. We are from Arizona and were visiting. We definitely will be back to visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast there before driving back to LA. The food was really good. My husband had pancakes and I had a Mile High omelet. Yum!"}
{"text":"A lovely little breakfast place we decided to visit on our way out of Vegas. The staff here were lovely, attentive and polite, but so were the patrons who visited. We had some great conversation with people as they were just so friendly and sparked up conversation when they heard my English accent.   Onto the food! I attempted the Monster Omelette challenge and failed miserably, but it was okay because the omelette was really yummy and fed me for another whole day...it contained masses of every filling they had, and was really perfectly cooked all the way through, 8 just wish it had a kick more seasoning (salt, garlic, pepper, spring onions, just something to make the egg taste a little less bland). The spuds here are deliciously seasoned and just so damn good but the tiniest bit on the greasy side, though this didn't stop me eating them all. I would order an entire plate of these next time I go back, And maybe try a burger as the gentleman on the table besides mine had one and it looked like a gourmet burger.  The pumpkin bread was LOVED by my girlfriend, she ate her's and mine and wanted more!!!! I wasn't a lover of it, It was too sweet for me as i have NO sweet tooth at all and tasted almost identical to an amazing carrot cake. I can see why it's loved, Even if I didn't like it myself. I will definitely be back here, And maybe fail at the burger challenge instead next time!!!!"}
{"text":"Classic country cafe . A must stop for any breakfast person....Try the Green Hornet  with a side of biscuits n gravy. ......mmmmm"}
{"text":"The best omelete is \"The Bugsy Seigel\" with extra sour cream & meat!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great omelets and homemade potatoes!  Service good and love the old fashion setting! Large portions -  great taste!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Service was great.  Looked busy from outside,  but this place is large. Plenty of seating.  Pumpkin bread and banana bread are very tasty. Had chicken fried steak,  very tender and potatoes were great. Everyone else in our group had omelets and had nothing but good things to say.  Will definitely visit again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I found this breakfast joint thanks to Yelpers!!  We were going to a house that serves pancakes and the wait was way toooo long.  So I yelped and read about the Omlet House.  I agree, this is a great place for grub.  It is a little dated, but not in a dirty way.  The service was prompt and the food was above par. The serving sizes are crazy big.  It is the best place in Hendertucky for breakfast.  The bread is awsome."}
{"text":"This is the real deal omelet house. The service was good not great, but the food is cooked fresh and was delivered to the table hot. The coffee was good had to ask a few time for a refill but again the food made up for the minor lack in customer service, maybe because they where busy?   I over heard some of the locals and they where surprised on how busy it was...I know why the food is really good....The next time in Vegas...I will be back....  Pleanty of parking in front and did I mention the food is really good."}
{"text":"Huge portions even with baby omelette.  I would advice you to share. Only $.95 more to share. The food was excellent. Stuffed myself, because i couldnt stand to leave it to waste."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had in a very long time. Delicious, fast and huge portions. We split an omelet and still couldn't finish everything.  They do present you with tough choices. Banana nut bread, pumpkin nut bread or toast?  Who chooses toast?  Potatoes were wonderful if you like them crispy."}
{"text":"The line at the door was super long but the staff is so efficient we didn't wait even 5 minutes to be seated. Everyone is so friendly make you feel at home & the food is delicious. Definitely the spot for a hearty breakfast."}
{"text":"Had the Eggs Benedict in which the hollandaise sauce was very good!. Hubby had the Kitchen Sink Omlete which he enjoyed but for me there was just to much going on. We also had the pumpkin bread because of how good the reviews were but personally I just thought it was ok. Needed more of a pumpkin flavor. We would go back if we were in the area but wouldn't go out of our way to eat there."}
{"text":"Had to go there twice, It was that good! Kids loved it, they fell in love w/the spuds. Mmmm!"}
{"text":"This place was ok, I had the health nut omelet and I got the baby size but I still couldn't finish, they give you tons of food.  Also lots of cheese on the omelet. The potatoes that came with it were very thin and oily.  But the omelet had a good taste.  Pancakes are also huge lots of chocolate if you ask for it. I recommend you share! Ps. My dad felt nauseous after."}
{"text":"I stopped in here based on yelp reviews and I was not let down!! I can eat and I almost couldn't handle all the food they threw my way! I will be back and tell my friends"}
{"text":"I went to Yelp as usual to find a non-chain restaurant for breakfast.  I am not a breakfast lover but my hubby and kids are so I am always looking for a place they will love.  This place was highly rated but a complete dump.  Decor aside as anyone can have bad taste, this place was old, run down and depressing.  The place is huge and the service was OK, as someone else noted the coffee was watered down.  The \"homestyle potatoes\" they serve were just home made potato chips.  We were all a little let down by this since hashbrowns done right can be sooo good."}
{"text":"The omelet house in Vegas is very good the server Christi was great very pleasant and nice thank you much"}
{"text":"Huge portions and a variety of omelets one does usually not see anywhere else. Spuds are tasty,omelet was bland. Service was nice."}
{"text":"Man! The food is yummy and it comes in a prodigious amounts. I had the chorizo omelet. I could not finish it. This comes from the guy who is a bodybuilder and used to big meals. It's a great place for tourists and it has that old school Vegas feel."}
{"text":"Exceptional service! HUGE portions! I'm am competely happy with the system they have going on here every worker is always moving around doing something and making sure every half full cup/glass is full and no waiting forever on my bill than have to wait longer to get change... DEFINITELY recommend this place to someone whom has not been... I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Bomb breakfast spot with HUGE portions. The banana nut bread was amazing as well. All food is scratch made; highly recommended and the coffee flows freely. Tip your waitress."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Went there with about 15 people and it didn't seem that the waitress could handle the party. About 3/4 of the way through our meal the manager had noticed and the staff really pulled together and demonstrated superb service. Hopefully they are better prepared for us next time we come."}
{"text":"What a wonderful breakfast. They have about 40 different omelets to choose from or you can create your own. Their omelets are usually 6 eggs. You get home made delicious \"spuds\"  with your omelet along with either toast or homemade banana nut bread or pumpkin spice bread. We got the baby omelets which were 3 eggs along with the homemade breads. So much food for the price. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast place whenever we come to vegas!!   I wouldn't call this place nice, as it looks sort of dilapidated on the outside, but the food is AMAZINGG. I think this just might be the best mom and pop place that I've been to. The inside sorta makes you feel like you're at grandma's house with all the little knick-knacks (is that a word?) and vintage posters.  The service is alright. I would say it's a hit or miss because sometimes they make me feel so welcome and are really engaging and other times its just standard, not bad though.   The omelets come with bread. Don't get the toast, GET THE PUMPKIN OR BANANA BREAD. I LOVVEE the pumpkin bread so I usually get that. Its totally tastes homemade, straight out of the oven good. Mmm    There's no one specific omelet I always get but everything I've had here has all been really good. The omelets are ridiculously huge and for pretty cheap too, so you might wanna share with someone, which they'll conveniently do for you for a small fee. The potato chips that come with the omelets are homemade too, which you can taste. Sooo yummy and fresh.  I've just recently got discovered eggs benedict (i know, what??) and this place has amazinngggg lobster eggs benedict!!! mmmm   I haven't found an equal to this place back in orange county so I can only get this yummy breakfast on my trips out here :[ I guess that gives me more of a reason to come back? ahhaha"}
{"text":"Came here for a nice breakfast.  The wait to be seated wasn't very long however the wait for our food was!  We both ordered the \"Corned beef skillet\" and finally after about 25 minutes our luke warm skillets arrived. We only gave them three stars because the server was very nice and the banana nut bread was awesome.  Soooooo \"Ihop\" here we come!"}
{"text":"This place is a great local spot. Gives military discount. Rare in Vegas. I ordered chicken omelet. It came with potatoes. I was thinking potatoes chips but they are soft sliced. I had chicken soup and it was good. Server was great as we came in just before closing at 3pm on a Saturday. It did not matter as service was outstandingly awesome. Friendly staff but very busy. If you need something jyst ask as they buzz through. They did not mind. This place also has a omelette challenge of 12 eggs. I used to race after that but watching it these days. It also has 3 lb burger blast challenge. It was only 19.95 for it. That is a steal based on all the other ones I know about around traveling USA. Great time and will return."}
{"text":"One of the best omelettes ever! I ordered the Californian omelette and it was pretty good, it had sausages, avocado, & cheese. The omelette was so huge, 2 people could probably share . The downside is that you might need to add some salt on top, or maybe it was just me. Will def visit again next time I go to Vegas ."}
{"text":"The banana or pumpkin bread is to die for. Omelette sate Hugh, have to made with 6 eggs. Definitely need to stop here when you are in town."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Visiting from Chicago and luckily found this place online with great reviews! Wonderful service, hospitality, and food!"}
{"text":"Had the jolly green giant omelet. Talk about delicious vegetable galore! Also, I subbed toast for the banana nut bread and I was not disappointed. I could definitely see myself coming here tomorrow."}
{"text":"took a cab from the Rio because of the reviews about this place.  The reviews where not wrong.  The food and the amount of food was over the top.  The home made potatoe chips where just great addition to the food.  Service was top shelf.  Wife and I where so full that we took out time and took the bus back to the Rio."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always great. The omelets are soon big, love the pumpkin bread."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in during a recent trip to Vegas.  Found this place on Yelp and we are glad we stopped in.  This was the first time I remember ordering an omelet for breakfast and was not able to finish.  Along with the large portions at a reasonable price the food was very good.  I liked how they? put a good portion of breakfast meats and cheese in my omelet.  Along with the good food the service was great and the owner came over and talked with my girlfriend and I.  I asked how many eggs were in the omelet and was told six.  The other thing I like is the old school feel and very friendly service.  Unfortunately these days this type of place is a dying breed so it's great to see there are places out there doing it right."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!  Banana bread and corn beef hash.  Yes please! Lobster omelet does not skimp on lobster!"}
{"text":"I had many eggs benedict in toronto, canada, but this place.....serves it the BEST.   The eggs benedict Lobster.....it is SOOO GOOD! thinking of going back to this place before I leave.  (such a big portion too!) Also, it comes with homemade fries (sliced as thin circle, like chips, ) it is so good too!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast food ever!!! My omelet was amazing! And to top it off, the people who work there and own it are so nice! I left my wallet there and Kelly got my cell phone number and called me to tell me I had left it! Such nice and honest people! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We made a deliberate attempt to visit this restaurant after seeing all of the positive reviews.  We ordered the Lobster Benedict which was superb.  Big pieces of sweet lobster meat and a delicious Hollandaise.  The reason I can only give it a rating of 3, however, is due to the potatoes.  Expecting the usual of hash browns or home fries the plates came with what I can only describe as nasty potato chips.  They were hard and greasy and we tried just a couple and left the remainder.  What were they thinking?  French fries would have been better."}
{"text":"After all I heard, I was disappointed in this place. The breakfast was OK. Yes, the potatoes are exceptional and the quick breads a nice touch.   We sat in a banquette & I noticed dirt & dust in the corner. If I see this in the front of the house, I can't help but wonder what the kitchen looks like! My husband's omlette tasted vaguely of shrimp, which made us wonder if the pan had been cleaned.  I'm sure there are better breakfasts in LV.  I"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!! Went there for lunch with my fellow co-workers...it was all of our first time! I mentioned that to our waitress & she gladly explained the menu & the freshness of everything!! I ate the Eggs Benedict with Lobster!!! YUMMY!! Chunks of lobster was fresh not rubbery and potatoes are delish too! Their banana bread was OMG good!!! Cozy atmosphere and fast & friendly service!! Definitely will go again! :)"}
{"text":"The omelet's are exactly as they appear on the menu, except they are HUGE!  6 eggs!  The waitress (Lisa?) was very accommodating and friendly.  She never let my water or coffee hit bottom.  It is a Mom and Pop place, ... and it shows!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast every time I'm in Vegas! The service is exceptional there! Interior has a homey feel and food is top notch and quick in terms of service. The price also cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"I'm retired and met another retired former coworker for breakfast at one of our favorite restaurants, the Omelet House. I've lived in Las Vegas 44 years and this is my favorite breakfast/lunch house. You have to try the Bugsy Siegel omelet that has marinated melt in your mouth beef chunks in a delicious Italian sauce, sour cream, and cheese. Their banana nut bread or pumpkin bread are a great substitute for toast. They have the best potatoes and I've never seen anywhere else. They are very thin sliced, fried and seasoned to perfection. Their baby omelets are 3 egg rather than their standard 6 egg omelet and I guarantee it is plenty to satisfy anyone's hunger at a discounted price."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Great mo and pop feel to the place . Lots of vintage inspired decor and items for sale. Seated promptly. I ordered waffles special with walnuts and whipped cream. Yumm. The syrup is warm and delicious.  It came with 2 eggs and bacon. Everything was great and served quickly. Only complaint I had was they overcharged our bill,so just do a quick double check. everything else was great. Server took a while to warm up but once she smiled and joked a bit she was great."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is always warming. Food portions are large and I always leave stuffed.    Make sure to get the banana nut bread.  But be warned. They are addicting."}
{"text":"HUGE portions and super friendly staff.  Love the potatoes (cut thin like potato chips).  They must put 5-6 eggs in their omelets.  Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service!  With these portions you could feed a small country!  The banana bread was so good!  If you're hungry and looking for a great omelet this is your place."}
{"text":"Two words:  Banana Bread!!!  Menu has a long list of selections of different types of omelettes.  They also have the sweet breakfast stuff like pancakes and french toasts, etc.  On other other side is the lunch menu, which I didn't even get a chance to look at, are burgers, salads, sandwiches, and other lunch items.  Got the Egg White special for $10.19 and got it \"baby\" omelette, which is an 89 cent discount for a smaller omelette.  Definitely get the \"baby\" portion if you can't finish a lot of food since the regular size omelettes are huge!!  Most of my friends couldn't finish their regular omelettes or split a regular one.  Egg white omelete was good - filled with zucchini, spinach, and some other stuff I forgot.  I added an avocado for an extra $1.49.  You couldn't really see the egg whites, though, because it was filled with a lot of veggies!!  It was pretty good, maybe needed a hint of salt.  Also comes with a side of potatoes sliced like potato chips and cooked almost like potato chips with a few soggy potatoes.  Sooo delicious!  I loved their potatoes.  I try not to eat too many potatoes (too many carbs) but I couldn't stop eating these.  Yum yum.  Comes with choice of banana bread, toast, or pumpkin bread.  Get the banana bread!!  It was soo good and delicious.  Came out hot and fresh with walnuts on top.  It was so moist and delicious with the butter.  So good!  There wasn't too much of a banana flavor but it was still really good!  Our waitress was awesome!!  So friendly and easy-going and talkative.  Makes you feel right at home.  They filled out waters all the time and checked up on us.  Got a taste of the hubby's coffee and it was good, too!!  All of my friends loved this place and their omelettes!  Would definitely come back if we're in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service ! Manager made  things right and the food is great I work close by and this is our dealerships go to for take out breakfast."}
{"text":"This remains the gold standard for breakfast in Las Vegas, and in fact the whole country.  I would say it's 2nd only to Bryant's Breakfast in Memphis, so definitely #1 West of the Rockies.  As I've mentioned before, go here the morning you're leaving: no chance you'll feel hungry on the plane flight home, however long it is.  I've been migrating from the popeye lately to the king of hearts omelet (which is with artichokes and jack cheese.)  I've also found you can get a \"small\" omelet if you ask for it, which comes on a small plate, but I think has the same amount of fillings, just fewer eggs (it only costs a few cents less, but a full-size omelet probably has a week's worth of eggs unless you get egg whites.)  The potatoes were better this time around...so I added the star back, although service was spotty (but friendly.)  My friend who was visiting Vegas this week liked it so much he insisted on coming here 3 mornings in the 4 days he was in town.  And don't forget the pumpkin or banana bread instead of toast...that's essential here."}
{"text":"Great place to eat great breakfast great service. . Come every week to have my Greek omelet the best. Servers are the friendly as is the owner. Best pace in town by far"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Way better food and service and food than Hash House. There is usually a 5-10 minute wait for a table because this joint is always busy. Yes the decor is old school and the servers have old school southern manners; that's what sets this place apart from most of Las Vegas. That and the home style cooking. Everything that I have tried is awesome. The coffee is brewed perfectly, scrambled eggs are nice and fluffy, omelettes are packed full of flavorful goodies and even the toast is perfect! This is my top favorite spot for breakfast in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good food/very good service/ginormous portions!!! Food is excellent. Homemade spuds are a treat. I had a chicken fried steak omelette with homemade gravy. My family continued to comment throughout the breakfast of how great it was. Only bad thing is there was a lot of left over food."}
{"text":"The portions sizes are large...totally hearty, feels-like-home-cooked breakfast! They're home-style potatoes were amazing!!"}
{"text":"6 egg omelettes will definitely fill you up.Value for your money because the portions are huge. You can even split it but you have to pay extra. Believe me 1 omelette will be more than enough for 2 people. The selection is diverse with lots of choices for everyone. They have lunch items but the breakfast items are more popular. Banana nut bread  is awesome. I had the Philly cheesesteak omelette and I could not finish it. The potatoes are great thinly sliced and a bit crunchy. These guys know what they are doing with regards to breakfast. Bring your appetite if you go here because the food portions are huge. BTW service is fast, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. No wait, we got seated right away. Not once did we have any trash on our table, old dishes, unfilled cups, or cold coffee for more than a minute or so. Every employee was nice and seemed happy, and were genuinely helpful. Plus the coffee was fresh and tasted great. Best omelette I've had in awhile, best service I've had in a long awhile, and best Sunday morning breakfast I've had in a good long while."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the staff and servers were awesome! The environment is family friendly as well. I wish this place were open all day, I would go all the time. Love, love, love! They definitely made a new regular out of me and my family!"}
{"text":"Good food but visit only when you are in the mood to indulge and eat all your 1200 calories in one day. I ordered the egg white special - which again was delicious but soaked in oil :). Just saying - if you are looking for healthy and someone in the group suggests this place - our choices are limited.. but then there's always the box it up for later option :)"}
{"text":"Went here with my in laws. Oh my goodness, I love those potato's crispy chips they serve with breakfast. The simple breakfast was done just right and the menu was hilarious. Thanks for the good breakfast food. I will be back for those potato's"}
{"text":"Wow, what a find we stumbled upon! It was extremely busy for a Friday morning, but the service was outstanding! We had the Farmer Juan, and Polack Omelettes, and they really hit the spot! We will be coming back here, thank you!"}
{"text":"Large portions, food taste really good. Had the cowboy omelet, I think I'll be good till dinner. Chili was very good with a nice little bite to it. Waitress was on top, making sure coffee was replenished and if we needed anything else. Hostess took our drink order when she seated us, I liked that, as well as brought the drinks to us.  I will eat here again."}
{"text":"BY FAR exceeded my expectations! Portions are by far the best I've seen for the price.... it's an EGGxelent deal... Ha ... waitresses are the best service I've gotten in a while and kept the coffee refilled constantly. It's really friendly atmosphere and left more than satisfied. If you could check out a place in Vegas this is the one"}
{"text":"Poor management. Manager is very loud when ordering tables clean.  Uncomfortable feeling to say the least. We were just told our food is taking longer than normal because they are busy. Umm shouldn't a restaurant be able able to handle additional volume.  Been waiting for 30 min now and no food.  Update 36 min we got our food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town, omelets are huge and generious portion of spuds which are a must. The location can do with a renovation, but that adds to the atmosphere so I wont knock it for being an old establishment. The 3lb burger is bland and is in need of seasoning and flavor - but a fun challenge and you get your picture on the wall!"}
{"text":"Amazing food...portions are big...definitely get your money's worth. ..service is great with a wonderful atmosphere. ..definitely going to be back next time we're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I as actually nervous to try this place in fear of them being better than my favorite breakfast joint back home, but i'm happy to report my fears were unfounded. The omelet was mediocre. The coffee was watery. The banana bread was ok. My mom makes it better. Maybe if I was a local I would go here every now and then but it wasn't worth drive off the strip to get here."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and many times. I rarely try other things on the menu but one of their omelets, so I usually get a try of something new from friends I go with. I tried my friends stuffed french toast -it was Good! I ordered another new omelete -the Carnitas. Ive had the lobster, Bugsy Siegal, meat lovers, etc. They were all good! Never fails -always leave full, happy and the Banana Bread is awesome..."}
{"text":"Awesome! Big omelettes! Fantastic flavors! Wish there were one of these in Phoenix! 5 stars for food! 3 stars for slowness, but it was busy!"}
{"text":"Short review: amazing selection, huge portions, specialty breakfast potatoes, quick and friendly staff.   5 stars may seem bold for a breakfast house, but this place is truly a diamond in the rough. Be aware - they don't have hash browns. But, rest assured you will be fat-kid happy with the huge portions and excellent prices. Plus, they have specialty breakfast potatoes that are seasoned perfectly and resemble potato chips you eat with a fork. I ordered the country fried steak and eggs, a classic breakfast dish on every menu. It blew Denny's and IHOP out of the water! From now on, I will not leave Vegas until eating here. It feels like grandma is in the back cooking up delicious food from your childhood."}
{"text":"Great value! Omelettes are made with 6 eggs and filled to the max with ingredients. So delicious! Great to split. Portions are huge. I'd recommend splitting an omelette. Waffles are so good also. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Omg. Well, their omelettes are 6 eggs, plus the other ingredients, so they are VERY shareable. The potatoes are delicious, and it even came with a bread (we got the banana nut which was great). Plenty of other staff running around refilling water & coffee, so it was nice to not have to wait. Knowing that it's diner style decor, it was cute and clean. Comfy booth."}
{"text":"Our dining group had a positive overall experience here.  The interior is unique and the down home dinerish feel that makes going to breakfast places enjoyable.  Plenty of seating to be had.  The service was excellent and coffee and water cups were filled frequently and without even being asked.  I had the chicken fried steak with country gravy and the homemade house chips.  The dish was accompanied by pumpkin bread.  The pumpkin bread  was plentifully apportioned and served with spreadable butter versus the normal hard butter.  The homemade chips were crisp and delicious.  Chicken friend steak is one of my guilty pleasures and this version of it was one of the better ones I've had, best version in Las Vegas.  One of our dinner patrons had one of the omelets and found it underwhelming.  I won't speak as to the omelet as I didn't have it.  Breakfast food is a hard market to set yourself apart in a positive direction from the pack.  My experience was a solid four and I would like to come back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Never had anything from here that I didn't like. Friendly staff. Amazing zucchini! Must try!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Go hungry! Go very very hungry.  Fun, old time atmosphere.  Popular place so there could be a wait."}
{"text":"Food is descent ... Ambience is great.. Old Vegas feel. Service is great ... 1st time I was there it was 4/5 stars this last time their game was a bit off... Slower service.. Long wait... Soggy breakfast potatoes and not yummy chicken fried steak omelet...."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, been coming here for 30 years not sure what has happened. This is the 2nd time in a month that this has gone on. We gave them a 2nd chance its a shame but wont be back!! We sat at our table 30 min no waiter, owner could care less has very poor customer service skills."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here yesterday morning. The food was amazing and portions were great. Our waitress was attentive and good. It wasn't long after we walked in at 9 am for us to be seated maybe a 5 minute wait if not less. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"The decor here is very 1980s trailer trash, but the food's surprisingly good.  A standard omelet is made with 6 eggs, so -- if you can get your friends to agree -- the kitchen will happily split your order on two plates. It costs $0.75 more, but you end up with a full order of spids on each plate... totally worth it. If you can't find an omelete you want ot split, they'll make you a \"baby\" omelet (3 eggs), but it's only slighly less expensive than a full-size one.  We opted for the chile verde omelet, and it was quite tasty. The spuds are more like thick, soft-ish potato chips than hashbrowns, but they're  addictive."}
{"text":"I have been to Omelet House so many times, I don't even want to know how many calories I've consumed here. Sometimes there's a wait, but trust me, the food is worth it!  I always order the chicken fried steak and eggs with pumpkin bread. The chicken is covered in gravy, and the potatoes are sliced and baked almost like chips but not quite. And the eggs are always sunny side up on my plate just the way I like them. The flavor is just right, you can taste the chicken, and potatoes, and the eggs despite all of them overflowing on one plate. The food is very filling and a great way to start your morning.  The staff is very friendly and always checking up on you. I appreciate good service, especially at busy places, and the wait staff at Omelet House are experts in good service.  I always bring friends to this establishment because of the diner atmosphere and great food. I will be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot in Vegas.  I LOVE the potatoes... they are cut thin like potato chips and have a magically delicious herb sprinkle on them.  I also love the pumpkin bread - SO GOOD.  I recommend getting it instead of toast.  I always get an omelet... usually something with avocado and lots of cheese.  Husband got cornbeef hash last time and I thought it was pretty tasty.  TIP:  Get the BABY size omelet.  The regular size is too big for any human to eat for breakfast.  Don't be a fatty."}
{"text":"My fianc√© brought me here a few months ago and I LOVED IT! Now, every time we have a day off and go to breakfast, I always want to come here. The pumpkin and banana bread is always super good and the number 16 omelet is to die for! It has roast beef, cheese and sour cream in it....it's like heaven on a plate!"}
{"text":"Always excellent!!!  Be it a \"plain old\" breakfast scrambler or a spinach salad with a raspberry, walnut vinaigrette this place's food always exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"I had an out of town guest visiting Las Vegas for the first time. While I was showing him around Henderson we opted to stop in at this place to eat, the food & service was simply amazing. It was my first visit, but won't be my last."}
{"text":"You would never know from the outside of the restaurant or from the neighborhood, that this is one of Las Vegas' best breakfast places!  Hands down... great food! Great service! Great price!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast.  Told the wait would be 15 - 20 minutes.  Waited 30 minutes.  Went to ask how much longer.  Told 30 more minutes.  Our name was 2nd down on list.  Do not appreciate being lied to about the wait.  We left."}
{"text":"If you like good breakfast after a long night of party. just go there at 7am. Food is amazing and quantity is huge. No more questions.."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and my Liberty Bell (Philly Cheese Steak) omelet was very delicious. The place is not for a light eater because the omelet was big."}
{"text":"Easy 10min drive off the strip. Looking at the outside of the building makes you wonder if you really want to eat there. But that didnt stop us from eating here. The homemade breads were awesome. The omelets are pretty descent in quality and size. $10 get you a descent breakfast.  1) low cost breakfast 2) generous portions 3) friendly wait staff"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with good food this is it! There omelets are huge. We either split one or take it home with us. The banana bread or pumpkin bread that comes with the breakfast is warm and delicious. The burgers, chicken fingers, and taco salads are very good too. You never go away hunger because you get lots of food and the prices are reasonable too. We love taking company there just to see the look on their faces when they see the omelets!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast places but this one was slow and the food was not good at all. I had the #38 omelet. Large plate of food that was over cooked and greasy. One omelet and a cup of coffee $14.99, a bit over priced. Try the omelet house at your own risk..."}
{"text":"I was on my way to the Strip to do some gambling with my pal Stan Diego.  I needed something to eat before a long day of debauchery.  Had a little trouble finding the place as the signage is somewhat misleading.  There were actually 4 or 5 cars idling in the parking lot waiting for the place to open.  Everyone made a rush for the door as soon as it was unlocked.  That has to be a good sign!  It's a quaint little diner - thought I was back in the Midwest for a second!!  I went with the Kitchen Sink omelet and it was WAY too much food for even a large person to eat.  But it was quite good, so I made a valiant effort to get on the outside of this beast.  Couldn't do it, though.  The potato-chip like thingys accompanying the omelet were nothing special, but I didn't have room for them anyway.  The service was great - everyone was very friendly.  Recommend."}
{"text":"Breakfast was yummy and a generous portion. I had the corned beef hash and my partner had an omelet. We were both happy with our choices. The pumpkin bread and banana-nut bread were fantastic. We left very full. Service was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Our last day here in Vegas, stopped here for breakfast cause of the good reviews but turned out to be VERY disappointed. The customer service is good but I ordered the Country Fried Steak and eggs and was mad. I could not enjoy it. It was salty and the eggs that I ordered \"over easy\" was not at all prepared right, the potatoes were like chips and was very dry. No flavor. I wish they had Beer battered Onion Rings. I wish the potatoes were diced and cooked with some bell peppers and grilled onions. Overall was disappointed in this dish. I also felt sick afterwards, my stomach was turning and had bubble guts! OMG! My friends also ordered here and were dissatisfied with there meals. Never coming here again, EVER!"}
{"text":"Generally very good food, but by far the WORST hash browns in Las Vegas, if not the western United States. Like gross potato chips, and unsuitable for human consumption."}
{"text":"The omelet house is good for inexpensive food, service is good and I love I get a fresh muffin with my meal! If you love omelets definitely come here!!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken fried steak. It came out piping hot and was fairly good. I just wish it were seasoned more and that the crust didn't fall off so easily. I didn't care for the potato chip-style potatoes, which seems to be popping up In a few places I've been to. They're too thin and I'm not a big fan of potato chips. I didn't like the biscuit. It was unusual for it to be grilled. It ended up tasting like toast and I wasn't in the mood for toast. So I took one bite and gave up. The pumpkin bread was good. The service was good, but she was a bit speedy that I don't think she even heard me say thank you."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived in Vegas for 20 years and I just discovered this place. It's simply amazing. The service was quick and friendly. My food server was attentive and smiling. The complementary banana bread was hot and fresh and absolutely delicious. I ordered the Philly cheese steak omelette and I was surprised how generous the portion was. And it was pretty tasty. Highly recommended for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Party of 5 and we all loved our breakfast!  I took the advice of other reviews and ordered the pumpkin bread, it was delicious! Two of us got our omletts \"baby\" and i still couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"We have now added this to our must eat list while in Vegas! How can you go wrong with 38 choices of omelets and I think I could have sat there and ate the homemade banana nut bread until I popped a button. This is the only place that I have had an omelet and had the \"stuffing\" was throughout.  Our only disappointment was that we found this place on our last day in Vegas so didn't get a chance to eat there more than once."}
{"text":"Be forewarned that the portions at the Omelet House are huge!  I ordered the \"baby\" size Mile-High City omelet with banana bread and I still could barely finish it, as the baby size covered half of the plate!  I was not a fan of their potato chips that come with the omelet, but their warm banana was terrific.  The omelet was slightly overcooked and seemed dry, but you can't beat the price for the crazy amount of food you receive.  The service was outstanding, but trying to get a seat on the weekend took 30-45 minutes.  Overall great food and service!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. The servings are huge. I'm a big eater but I hardly finished half of it. If you go there, go there hungry. The waitress that served us, Devynn, was so courteous and friendly, which made the experience even better. Ask for her table, you won't be disappointed. Another wait staff, Torres, was also super friendly.  Don't forget to have their pumpkin bread. This was the highlight of our trip."}
{"text":"My husband and I just tried to go there.CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED.  and very seedy looking. 9:22am"}
{"text":"First taste at this omelet house - sign says it's been around since 1978 - yeah, i can believe it and my guess is at least 1/2 the servers have been there since day one.   Gf and i had omelets - big surprise - she went with the veggie, i went with the porky pig - i'm guessing 5-10 eggs in each , a seriously huge omelet - we didn't eat 1/2 of it - hope it keeps for tomorrow's bk.   comes with potatoes that closely resemble potato chips. tried the banana bread and the pumpkin bread ( more like cake )   tried a bite of each - very good.   Overall, just ok by me - like the old school feel to the place, but after a couple bites of the omelet just felt like it was lacking much flavor - my guess is they used farmer john skinless links for the filling - not much of the lil buggers either.   total cost with coffee , $22 so it ain't exactly cheap eats , sure i can take 1/2 our order home but i doubt it's like day old spaghetti, pizza, and the like.   and yes, at Scott's directive, I took some pics with my cell phone but the banana bread looks more like meatloaf then bread !!   happy eating"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak it was Outstanding!!!!  Family Friendly. Thank you Kathy for making it enjoyable."}
{"text":"The standard omelet is made with 6 eggs!  So my wife and I split a plate.  40+ omelets to choose from, lots of good sliced, fried potatoes, good coffee, good pancakes; you just can't go wrong here for breakfast.  Some favorites include lobster or lox egg's Benedict.  The decor is fun and homey.  The service is always friendly, too."}
{"text":"GET THE BANANA BREAD! That's all you need to know. Fairly standard breakfast otherwise, but with huge portions. Not a fan of the potatoes they serve in place of traditional hash browns, though that doesn't mean they are bad, just a personal preference."}
{"text":"We ate here the first time the other day for breakfast. We ordered chicken fried steak with banana nut bread and lobster eggs Benedict  with yummy hollandaise sauce and pumpkin bread. The bread was warm and it came with soft whipped butter. I have no complaints........I will order the lobster eggs Benedict again. The atmosphere felt like grandma's house. Our waitress was very fast, friendly, and attentive. Great customer service!!!! I'll be back!!!! A+"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast in Vegas, hands down!  This is a tradition in my family to eat here the morning we fly home each trip. Biscuits and gravy like grandma used to make. Portions are huge and I haven't been disappointed by anything we've ordered. Omelets and fried potatoes are delicious and they make banana bread and pumpkin bread that you can get with your meal in lieu of toast. We always get some to go for the flight. Don't be fooled by the exterior - it looks small but this place is pretty big. Multiple rooms and can seat large groups easily.   I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to have breakfast off the strip. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of restaraunts and worked in the hospitality industry for over 18 years and I can clearly state \"THIS IS THE NASTIEST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.\"  Right from the get go, the smell here is horrific.  Why did I not turn around right then you ask???? Great question,,, I am going to say that the stench is so overwhelming it puts you into a mild coma and you are not able to clearly function or think straight.  That caused me to to stay.  I was also having not such a good morning so I just gave in and figured something to eat would help.  I ordered a polish sausuage sandwich on sourdough.  Let's just say that the cup of mustard that was on this aboration was too much to handle.  I brought it up to the server who could care less excetp to say \"Yeah, that's a lot of mustard\".  That was his solution.    So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer. 2) The food cannot really be called that.  The slop they serve is litterally unedible.   3) The service staff has ZERO clue what service is and how to take care of anyone.    This place should honestly be blown up.  What a pit of despair."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and the quality of food and service was substantially worse. Got lobster Benedict.  English muffin was pulled straight out of the bag, not toasted, still cold and chewy. Lobster was burnt and cold at the same time, how is that possible?  To top it off they tried drowning it in sauce to cover it up.  no banana bread.  Coffee got filled once.  If you're paying $3 for a cup of regular low quality coffee to caffeine addicts the selling point is obviously refills. Server came by only to take order and give me the bill."}
{"text":"OMG we almost didn't go in here as teen and I protested to husband who found it on Yelp because it looked really shady. Typically I'm not such a princess, but that is really only on my home turf of Mpls/St. Paul where I'll go anywhere. It's in a really run down mall and hard to spot from Charleston.   Nothing special inside - really old school from the 70s. Everything was great, no fantastic, but don't waste food and order an omelet to split. There's some fun humor on the menu too. The hot pumpkin bread, no cake, is to die for as are the seasoned potatoes/chips. This is a must do in Vegas. Nice break from the hustle too."}
{"text":"Green chili pork omelet! Kitschy and consistent food and service! This was the first breakfast I had in Vegas! Refills keep coming and the option of banana bread or pumpkin bread is a delicious touch!  It's obvious the staff works hard!"}
{"text":"Well this location passed my mother in laws stamp of approval!  Believe me that's the hugest compliment I can offer!!! Waiter hung in there with her hearing limitations and made sure she had to go containers of pumpkin bread!  We've visited the other henderson location numerous times but found the wait to be non existent in spite of a tour bus having just loaded!  Corned beef is a fav here, I'm fond of the banana bread, chicken fried steak and the MULTIPLE vegetarian options Rock! Never makes sense to order the small portions! Most times we have another meals worth to take home!  My suggestion.... I bet you would make amazing zucchini bread!!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to TripAdvisor, we decided to try this place. I'm so so happy we did! The food was incredible! So fulfilling and delicious! I had the lobster Benedict which was to die for! My husband and his parents all enjoyed their selected omelets. We will definitely be back when in Vegas! The staff are amazing as well! They make you feel like your the only person in the room."}
{"text":"Food was goooooddd. I went on a Monday , and it was very chill. Not busy. I got seated by a talkative young girl which was annoying but that's okay, it's not inlet house fault. Anyways, a lot of good choices. And really recommends family to go. Better than the hyped up IHOP everybody goes to."}
{"text":"Went there a few times with my husband and family the staff is always friendly and very efficient and the food is good I do recommend them"}
{"text":"So delicious...from the huge omelette to the stuffed french toast. Everything I have tried here has been very good. Great service and food."}
{"text":"Home fries are homemade potatoes chips....  That's not the limit of unique food here though.   The selection is amazing,  and you'll find a little bit of everything here.   I got the lobster omelet,  and you cannot go wrong fir $15 with this delightful dish.   Service is also great,  though we were the only ones in the place at 7am.  The only reason I'm not giving the Omelet House  five stars is that the place is a little dated.   It has charm,  but is in need of a nice face lift."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast just about anywhere. Get an omelet (you can't go wrong with any of them), pumpkin bread, and potatoes. I moved away 2 years ago and I STILL crave Omelet House."}
{"text":"I live down the road and come here all the time! Great food, great atmosphere, great people. The portions are HUGE. Just the place for a Sunday breakfast, bring your newspaper. I love the hometown feel of this place, I feel like I can really relax and take my time having my breakfast. Try the banana bread and the fried potato sides."}
{"text":"Wow. This has got to be one of the best breakfast places I've ever tried. I tried their Lobster Omelet which came with a side of fries and banana nut bread. Also tried the fried zucchini as a starter. The tempura they used for the zucchini was just the right amount. It reminds me of the tempura that Japanese restaurants use. The half size was more than enough for two people. The Omelet was extremely big. It was also really good. Even the side of chips were made fresh. I also liked how they had three selections of hot sauce. I didn't finish my Omelet because I wanted to save room for my banana nut bread. This restaurant has one of the best nut breads I've ever tried in my life. The service was really amazing. I want to go back to this place again. I just think that their menu is way too big. It seemed like there were over 100 items. Lol so it was really hard to decide. Overall, my experience was amazing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place was okay. The service was very slow but he good was absolutely great I really enjoyed it. WOULD recommend just bad service"}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Be prepared for a lot of food.  Staff are smiles and friendly.  Wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good breakfast spot when the line at The Egg & I was out the door. Decided to give this place a try after reading some of the reviews. Sooo glad we did. The food was great. Split the Chicken Fried Steak Omelet and the Blueberry Stuffed French Toast. We tried the pumpkin and banana nut bread. Both were absolutely delicious, straight from the oven warm, and just quite perfect. Service was great. Servers were helpful with the menu, offering suggestions, and always around with coffee and water refills. Can't wait to come back, try a new omelet, and have more banana nut bread!"}
{"text":"I love the omelet house I come here all the time with my work partners friendly staff and good food"}
{"text":"An old-school off-the-strip joint with tons of omelets including the \"Kitchen Sink\": they throw everything in it and hope it works.  Highlight: Pumpkin nut bread"}
{"text":"This place is definitely good. The food is above average and the service is fantastic, you never run out of coffee which is always a good thing. The establishment has been around for a long, long time so be aware of the old fashioned pictures of celebrities that have dined there at the main entrance. You'll never be disappointed when you come here, guaranteed. Definitely a spot to try if you're hungry for breakfast."}
{"text":"the Jolly Green Giant & Popeye omelettes were good, and it was a good serving size (we could only eat half of our omelette)...i like that they had a variety of healthy omelettes, and you can substitute for egg whites"}
{"text":"I love this place, It has just enough of crust that makes the food that more delicious. The waitresses are fast and efficient. The food is good and the portions are large. Its a great place to get away from the hustle of the strip or downtown. My advice is to skip the over priced buffets and come and enjoy a meal and experience. I want to give it 3 stars because I dont like the potatoes they serve, they are almost like a greasy potato chip. My advice is to skip the spuds and sub it for something else."}
{"text":"Had the lobster egg Benedicts and pancakes. Great tasting and very reasonably priced. Good service in a very traditional cosy place. Will definitely be missed."}
{"text":"I went here at about 10am and didn't eat again until the next morning. These portions are huge and soooo good don't let the outside fool you. Well worth the trip and money for some real great food off the strip !!"}
{"text":"Came here on New Years day and even though it was very crowded, the wait was minimal (they told us about 15 minutes but seated us within 5).  I had probably the best omelet I ever had, I went with the Meat Lovers Omelet with Polish Sausage, and it was freaking amazing.  The portions were huge, I literally had to bring 1/2 of it home with me, I reheated it the following morning and it still tasted great.  My wife got the stuffed french toast, and we thoroughly enjoyed both of our meals.  We will be back several times I'm sure."}
{"text":"I've had a chance to think about this place a bit since my original review and I had forgotten about how good the potatoes were and I remembered that the service here is great. Bumped up my review from 3 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Stop, don't look anywhere else.  We are out of towners, and all 4 of our meals were fast, excellent, and Amy our server was world class!   This is one of those all American breakfast diners that lives up to the quality and portions that are very good.  You can tell they spend time picking ingredients and people who make their restaurant delicious.    Recommendations: chili verde omelet and the Blueberry French toast!  Well done Omelet House!!!"}
{"text":"I found out about the place from an employee at Aria Casino.  Went there for the 1st time last week for brunch.  Amanda was our server.  She was personable and attentive.  I had the homemade corn beef hash.  It was delicious - you have to try it.  Everyone at our table enjoyed the potatoes, which were like thicker chips.  It had the right balance of seasoning.  The eggs were made to order, and were not over or undercooked.  The pancakes were delicious.  The 2 types of breads they served were warm and very tasty.  Next time, I want to starve myself and come back to try the lobster omelet.  The person who ordered it said it was huge and tasted very good.  They give you a lot of food.  It makes me hungry just writing this review."}
{"text":"They have a big space. Great for our big party lunches during weekdays. All I have to do is call them when we are on our way to tell them about our big party and they will set up the tables for us.   Never have any problems with group of 12 and food comes fast. 10.19 for my favorite omelette and a huge portion.   Staffs are always super nice as well."}
{"text":"Massive portion sizes! Fair prices.  I came here with my parents on a Sunday morning; the place was packed. The restaurant is fairly large with plenty of indoor waiting space. Wait time was about 20 minutes. Service is quick and friendly.    Now onto the food.   The three of us (small Asian people), ordered two entrees.   First ,the Short Stack Combo: 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and 2 sausage patties. Great pancakes, they're a bit sweet so you don't necessarily need syrup. Eggs and sausages were flavorful, but were not unique   Finally, the Kitchen Sink: A massive omelet with all the varieties of meat and veggies, cheese, and house special chili. Served with a side of carbs bread and potatoes. We chose pumpkin bread. The bread is served fresh and warm with plenty of butter. It's  Its soft and fluffy and great with a bit of butter. Delicious! The potatoes are chips, not crunchy with a bit of seasoning. The omelet is massive! Delicious! Flavorful! Everything you ever wanted from an omelet was served. I took home half and I needed split it into two servings to finish. It was still good days later.  Omelet House was worth it! Get the Kitchen Sink and share with 2-3 people. Worth every penny. :D"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with my family and was immediately greeted by a couple of people and was seated right away!  We ordered two large omelets which we all split.  The waitress told us that each large omelet was made with 6 lg eggs so we knew right away we wouldn't be able to finish an order by ourselves. My two sons ordered an omelet with bacon and cheese....both were in heaven!  My husband and I shared a lobster omelet and we were in heaven too!  We ordered the banana and pumpkin breads as our sides and they were both mouth watering. Moist and warm and served with a side of butter...what more can you ask for!  We also saw the table next to us eating their fried zucchini!  So we decided to place an order for one. Wow...glad we did that!  The batter was light and flaky.   The service there was phenomenal!  Our drinks were never half empty. Our waitress always made small talk and she was like that with everyone!  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've had in this city so far.  It's cute and comfortable, with plenty of seating.  Servers are polite and speedy.  The menu is fun- silly names for some of the items.  And the portions are *huge*. I would recommend sharing an omelet, I don't know if one person can eat all of it!  And the potatoes are super yummy."}
{"text":"WOW! What can I say! What a great place and great service.  Joanne and Alex were amazing, the drinks and food was terrific, the atmosphere very nice and  comfortable, the price is very reasonable.  This was our last day in Vegas and we were looking for a breakfast spot on our drive back to Phoenix googled and found this gem! Definitely 5 stars! I give9 myself 1 star for not finding the Omelet House our first day here!  So to anyone in Maryland my home, and all the east coast, this is the the only time i will say \"what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas! I'm telling all about this! I'm coming back to this spot every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best omelets to provide me three meals in one!  And their banana bread they serve is amazing.  A family favorite in my household!"}
{"text":"Cute little place! My eggs with chorizo were amazing and defitnely fulfilled my prego cravings...."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas!  Wonderful food courtesy people.  Definitely a 10 in my book! Everyone should try this place if you want good home cooking!"}
{"text":"A cute & quaint, older, countryside-style restaurant that gives you the feeling like you're eating breakfast at grandmas. All the portions are big here, including dishes featuring lobster. Turned out to be soooo good. I got a lobster Benedict plate served with their homemade potato crisps. And being the starchy carb lover that I am, these potato crisps are probably my new favorite breakfast side. I could have a plate of JUST that. The servers are extremely friendly here, again making you feel as if grandma is serving you. I overheard plenty of warm conversations between servers and locals, so heart-warming. Omelettes are huge here too. My hungry hippo of a boyfriend couldn't finish his. I definitely recommend this place for a nice family Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! I am stocked to find this place. Their omelets are out-of-control delicious!!!! Banana nut and pumpkin bread are so-so-so good!!!! Host and server were super nice and courteous! Mind: portions are HUGE!!!!! I made 2 meals of my omelet! Favorite: Country Club!!!! DUh-licious!!!!!! Tasty, priced right, off the strip! A must-visit spot! Thank you, guys, so much!"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast. I highly recommend the cowboy special omelet. The chili in it gives it kind of a twist of an average omelet."}
{"text":"Huge portions, cheap and delicious, served with a smile. What more could you want for breakfast?"}
{"text":"1st visit today 01-03-18.. My husband & myself decided to try the Omlete house cuz it was a convenience being so close to our Dr's office. Let me say this We were VERY impressed. The Service was wonderful & the food was excellent!! We will return there ASAP."}
{"text":"I love how the place looks it's just like a little cottage house. The knickknacks are adorable I wanted them all. there was a lot on The menu but I wanted to order an omelette . Just to try it out the server had advised us that the portions were big so she suggested to split the plate. if I didn't know that I would've got one plate for myself and my mother. We were glad that she let us know because we were full at the end. I also love that when u order hot tea they bring out the many different options. We tried Health Nut"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Highly recommend the chile verde burrito. Their house potatoes are great too, as well as the banana bread. The staff is super polite. It was so good I went there two days in a row and they remembered me on the second day!"}
{"text":"Let me begin with our waitress Megan was great!  Now for the food . I got the black forest omelette , it was  awesome! The fluffiest omelette filled with so much cheese and big chunks ham and big pieces of mushrooms. This omelette was Huge And the potatoes were the best I've had! This meal was enough for two. We actually came back the next day for a repeat of the same great service and great food. Well done ! Don't forget to ask for Megan."}
{"text":"This is exactly the breakfast we wanted while in Vegas! Excellent deal...great portion sizes...quick service. After a couple days on the strip this was a welcome addition to our trip. We had pancakes, French toast, bacon, and eggs for 3 people for well under $30 it was filling and delicious."}
{"text":"amazing everything especially potatoes, banaba bread and lobster omelet yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from Vegas and went to the Omelet house on our last day. The service was great! Our waitress was super efficient. The food was excellent my husband got the chorizo omelet he said it was great! I got the californian it was also great! I would have to say the potatoes were the highlight those things are ridiculous! It was an awesome first experience we will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I are huge fans of quaint little coffee shops. I found this one on Yelp and decided to give it a try. It is amazing! The coffee is so good I had 3 cups. It's hard to find good coffee anymore and this was the best. The waitress and servers stopped by no less than 6 times during the first 15 min. My fianc√© got warm banana bread with his meal and it was really good. The portions are large and the corn beef hash was real corn beef. The crispy potatoes are a nice change from typical hash browns and the bacon was just right. This place is definitely going to be a regular stop on my trips to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! On a whim and by accident, I brought a friend here for breakfast on a Saturday. It was busy, but we didn't have to wait long for anything. Not to be seated, food or check. Our waitress was Shirley and she was a doll, sweet, funny, and prompt. Everything tasted delicious and very well portioned (they have a plate \"sizes\" in case you're starving or just got the hangrys) These folks are family/locally owned (a big plus for us locals to support each other!) I had the pleasure of meeting Kevin and thanking his for the great place he has! We will be back on purpose this time!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Each and every time has been outstanding. Service is awesome. Food is great tasting, more than enough on each plate. The staff here if friendly makes you feel at home. Very affordable for the amount of food served. I highly recommend this place for a great breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Big portions, tasty and some of the best service we have received! This will be my Vegas go-to breakfast place."}
{"text":"The omelets are incredibly huge, the service was awesome, they never let my cup of coffee go too low. Food was great! I would recommend this place to everyone. Menu is large, if you can't find something you like, you're way too picky."}
{"text":"Don't be discouraged by the looks of this place it is by far one of the best places to eat where the locals go. I been here a handful of times.. well a big handful of times and try something new (usually). I have yet to be disappointed. Big shout out to the staff for having such great service. I couldn't complain even if i tried."}
{"text":"This place had pretty cool decor and very good service from my waitress Shirley and the entire staff.  However, the food was nothing spectacular. Would have been a 2 star rating if I rated on the food only."}
{"text":"Fabulous breakfast place.  We wanted a good, local breakfast/ brunch place away from the madness of the strip.  We found this and loved it!  The food was great, as well as the service, not to mention the price was right!   Tip: servings are large enough that you may be able to split (though they do charge a small fee for this)."}
{"text":"We were staying on the strip and wanted to venture out for some breakfast where the \"locals\" eat. my good old yelp app on my phone directed me to this place. With many strong reviews and a good history now of fellow yelpers not leading me astray I went for this breakfast joint. to self: Good call, you did well. There was a fast moving line out the door and it was evident this was where the locals get their breakfast grub on. This ain't their first rodeo here, they know how to seat you and get good food out fast. Wow, what great service they have. Nice friendly greeting and we were sat down promptly. Coffee cups were quickly brought out and filled and bottoms of cup never seen again. Hot and good coffee too! I had the chicken fried steak with eggs and my wife had the eggs benedict. Both were spot on. Could not have been happier with our decision to have breakfast here. Thanks again yelp and thanks omlett house. This is a very well run place. Will be back next time in Vegas and need arises to follow late night on Freemont Street with solid breakfast."}
{"text":"The pumpkin bread was excellent.  The omelette was really large!  I finished it, but felt a little sick after.  It could have used some more seasoning, and I found myself drowning it in hot sauce.  Also, the potato chip like potatoes were not my favorite."}
{"text":"Corned beef hash is amazing, as is the verde omelet, and Huevos rancheros! Best Huevos I've ever had. Pumpkin bread is amazing. Service was top notch. So many regulars. Honestly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Sketchy!!! wrong meal delivered, never delivered my toast,  freaky people in here right now!!! WTF???"}
{"text":"A Las Vegas hidden historical gem! Food is delicious and you will never leave hungry! A regular favorite is the Bugsy Siegel Omelet - definitely need to try it! It may not be new or shiny, but it is too good to pass up."}
{"text":"This is our first stop when we land in Las Vegas or drive into Las Vegas. All the food is fantastic!!! Especially the omelette. Oh, and don't forget the pumpkin or banana bread. Best kept secret for almost 40 years. Can't wait to return and have my usual. The Polak Omelette!!!!"}
{"text":"I never thought I would be full on an egg white omlet but this one did me in. I couldn't finish it. It came with these fried potatoes that look like thick chips. They were tasty and nicely seasoned. The pumpkin nut bread was a nice treat that I took with me to eat later.  Service was ok but not outstanding,  hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"In town for a quick weekend; we were looking fir someplace yummie, that was off strip with free parking, thanks to Yelp we located this place. When we arrived it was PACKED. Starving...we prepared for the wait. Luckily we were seated quickly!! :) AMAZING unique selection of omelettes. And other breakfast foods... And the BEST BANANA BREAD that I have EVER had in my life... And it came with the omlette... as a side. I will be back... next time I visit...."}
{"text":"Food was GREAT! Huge portions of meat & veggies. Eggs are fluffy. Real sausage country gravy. The meals come with seasoned chips on bottom, maybe ask for it on side bc it came out soggy. Friendly service. Ugly outdated decor. Nice lil breakfast nook though."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a child. The omelets are so good! It's great that they offer egg substitute and \"baby omelets\". The Baby Omelet consists of 3 eggs, while the regular is 6-8 eggs aka HUGE.  Also for a small price of about a $1 you can share the regular omlete and get a side of potato spuds and bread. such a good deal!!  You have to try the pumpkin bread or banana nut bread, so good and always comes out nice and warm with a side of butter. The potatoes are home made potato chip style, so good! they sprinkle them with a little garlic salt.   The burgers are good too!!   Great service and great prices. I have been to all locations and this one if my favorite even with the 70's decor."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been hopping around breakfast joints every Saturday for the past like, 2 years. Thats kind of our thing. Once we had Omelet House, we stopped going to the other places.. I mean I would consider myself a professional breakfast connoisseur with all of the places Ive been to in vegas. I have never been to a better place in my life. Here is why: You walk in the door on a saturday morning at like 8-8:30.. immediately seated. If its after that, you're looking at a 10 minute wai.. if that. The hostess is always sweet, the bussers fill your coffee when its half way down, the servers are friendly and on point. Our favorite server is Devinn (not sure of her spelling) but she is absolutely sweet. We get her pretty often, but would still vouch for any other server in that joint. She subtly remembers us which is cool because she knows we are regulars but still services everyone else like they are too.  NOW..the food. Lets just say, you get BEYOND what you pay for. This is literally THEE omelet house. There are so many choices. Not only are their omelettes delicious, but everything else I have tried was delightfully satisfying. Their portions are huge! Even ordering the baby size I still cant finish it, but its also priced very low. I dont mind splurging on the tip!  I personally love the decor. I was a little weirded out at first, but it kinda reminds me of my grandmas house. Plus its pretty eye catching and you wonder where it all came from. I will forever continue my Saturday rituals at The Omelete House."}
{"text":"We are on town for a few days and we wanted to find a breakfast place not too far from the Mob Museum. Thanks to Yelp, I stumbled upon this place and the menu looked decent. We were not disappointed. The omlets are HUGE and they come with homemade chips and your choice of bread, I chose pumpkin, or sub for fruit and other items.   I chowed down on a green chili omlet (i can't remember the specific name) and it was awesome. Omlet filled with large chunks of pork and a tasty green chili blend and cheese. Delicious! The pumpkin bread was also amazing. Don't think Starbucks pumpkin bread. This is a mini loaf of pumpkin bread made with walnuts and raisins(?). Fantastic. Amazing. Yummy.  The waitress was also great. We walk in right at closing because we didn't realize the time and they didn't hesitate to seat us and we got great service."}
{"text":"Drove 20+ miles to eat here. They have the best spuds! Best omelet in town so far, very good home made corned beef hash too :)"}
{"text":"Great service and great food!! Will definitely return here when we come back to Neveda!!"}
{"text":"I had some Banana Nut Bread (Hot and tasty!), and the Lobster Benedict (it was OK - but I think it was canned) and lastly the Homemade potatoes (Chips) were great!"}
{"text":"I've been in Vegas my whole life and I've been eating here since around 5th or 6th grade (I'm 31 now). The only thing that I have ever ordered here is The Kitchen Sink. I once had a bite of my brother's chicken friend steak and eggs (one of my favorite breakfasts), but I still only order The Kitchen Sink.  The potatoes are always good. My daughter loves them. My wife loves them and I love them. The one thing I don't love is the sausage change in The Kitchen Sink. I'm not sure when it happened, but I like the previous sausage better. The new sausage isn't bad, it just isn't the same. If you've never been, it won't matter much because you can't miss what you never had.  Check this out one morning when you're looking for a great place to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"After dragging him to countless other breakfast places, my boyfriend has always insisted that this place was the cream of the crop. Only after trying the banana nut bread did I understand his affinity for Omelet House.  The banana nut bread is the best I've ever had, and they have a great selection of omelets for every palate. I particularly enjoyed the chili skillet and the surfer omelet.  Also, the customer service here is wonderful. Such friendly staff every time!"}
{"text":"OMG incredibly awesome food Service fantastic as long as you don't come on a weekend. It's busy because it's that good. Banana bread delicious. Hod Lobster eggs benedict that was just out of this world! Very reasonable prices!  awesome place for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lobster Benedict and it was heaven with each bite.  I will come back to this place every time we come to Vegas for that Lobster Benedict!  Everyone else in our party loved their food too!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge. Too bad we didn't heed to the recommendation to split dishes. The kids loved their plain and chocolate chip pancakes. The omelettes were superb too. Awesome breakfast. So grateful for all the other yelpers who recommended this place."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews my husband and I decided to give it a go.... wah wah wah. Hubby ordered chicken fried steak and banana bread. He said the bread was awesome, and that the chicken fried steak was o.k and that Big Dogs is better. I ordered the American Cheeseburger ( i know i ordered a cheeseburger in a breakfast joint ) but I was still thinking its a family owned diner it should be good. BIG Mistake..it was hands down the worst cheeseburger I have had in my life! The meat tasted like it was old and from one of those tubes that you buy for 2 bucks at the store. It was burned on the outside and pink in the middle, over worked dry and tough, the bun was wet from the wilted veggies. It actually made me sick ( i only are 2 bites )The atmosphere is unclean and it smells like dirty grandmas. I dont know how it got so many rave reviews... I guess people have no taste buds! And to top it off it was 35 dollars ( with my daughters 1 pancake included ). Stay away unless you like being sick and paying for it."}
{"text":"The Californian omelet with added mushrooms and spinach. Very well made cooked all the way though."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, with generous servings at fair prices. Staff was kind and profressional, highly recommended."}
{"text":"What more is there to say that hasn't been said already?  I come here almost every time I visit Vegas.  Omelets are made with half a dozen eggs and they're awesome.  And of course, absolutely order the banana bread.  I honestly think it's the best banana bread I've ever had.  On the other hand I finally tried the pumpkin bread and it's just a much tamer version of the previous.  So skip out on this."}
{"text":"I usually go to the the original spot where they have cooler antique stuff at the front. So that's my only recommendation is that this place needs more or that. Otherwise, as far as I can tell, the food's just as good. If you order an omelet here, know that they prepare their omelets with 6 eggs! Half a dozen! That's a really big omelet. You can order a smaller version and it'll only be 3 eggs. Never had an omelet I didn't like here. Also, their banana bread is awesome. Definitely order a side of it and have it with butter."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband's family a few weeks ago.  Most people in our party seemed to enjoy the food, but I just thought it was mediocre.  I ordered the ham and eggs with potatoes and sourdough toast.  The ham wasn't that good, and the potatoes were like chips.  Not exactly what I wanted, or was expecting.  However, the banana nut loaves were DELICIOUS!  Warm and perfect with butter.  The service was exceptional, which makes up for the bland food.  However, I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Yep me and my girlfriend came in today to have some breakfast and our server Joe S he was great service good food and we will return."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Omelet House for many years, but today I stumbled across a hidden menu item (well I'm making it a menu item) with Dena's help... I'm calling it \"veggie nachos\". While trying to avoid meats cheese and egg, I was worried I would have to watch everyone eat stuff I liked, but Dena suggested their Spuds (i like mine crispy) with veggies on it... It is awesome (I added jalape√±os). If your going veggie, or just wanting to try it, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting for the weekend and we were so happy to have come across the Omelet House. They had a full house but luckily there was one free table for us. Our waitress was very kind and the service overall was excellent.   The food was great! My parents ordered the kitchen sink omelet and it was so tasty. The plate was so large they were able to share. Most of the plates come with sliced potatoes which were so full of flavor. I ordered the waffle breakfast which came with bacon or sausage, and eggs. The waffle was so light and delicious. And my sister ordered the chicken fried steak. I'm usually not a fan of chicken friend steak but this one was very good.   I'll definitely be back when I visit in the future."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite spot in Vegas! Best breakfast and lunch on the planet! I love the chicken fried steak and eggs... it's heavy but epic!Their signature banana nut or pumpkin bread that comes with breakfast is to die for! The omelettes are huge! I like to get the baby sized portion so I can actually finish. Their fried zucchini and cheese dip and ranch is my favorite! The half order is just enough for my family. I have yet to have a bad meal here! Their sandwiches to their burgers are amazing!"}
{"text":"Love their huge menu and the pumpkin and banana bread!  They don't normally serve the traditional hash brown as a side to the omelet, but the chips are good.  I always read that there might be a long wait, but the few times that I've been there it was quick and fast."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Kevin (Owner) is the rudest person I have ever encountered! We had an emergency and had to run right after we put in our order & Kevin came at our table and yelled at us! I couldn't even believe it.   F You Kevin! Me and my family have been coming to this restaurant for years and will NEVER go tho this location EVER AGAIN!   The Rampart location is much cleaner, and everyone who works there is nice with excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Definitely a Las Vegas icon. Took me 3 years of being in the city before I discovered this with my wife. Great history and huge portions. Then again I did order the kitchen sink!"}
{"text":"After a week of $20 coffee and croissant in LV, we ventured to Henderson for breakfast.  Wow!  Excellent omelets, staff was sweet and attentive, a great experience."}
{"text":"Have been to this place so many times with family and friends. Quick service and delicious food. Always a must to get their banana bread or pumpkin bread! So delicious"}
{"text":"Everything was great this morning for our breakfast.  Especially our server... Wish i would have got her name. We were very needy this time and she kept up with all our little hassles with a great smile.  (we did tip generously in case u were wondering. 35% she was truly a gem)  Oh And the bathrooms were tidy."}
{"text":"Another amazing breakfast joint if you're like omelets then you are in omelet heaven Outstanding chef, staff and management great food portions flavorful food  Loved it"}
{"text":"fantastic food!! fantastic service (shannon)!!! gigantic portions!! excellent value!!! highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This establishment isn't even deserving of 1 star. One word to describe it = RACIST. On our short visit to this place we were met by a man who looked at us all and said \"oh now i see whats going on here... i have the perfect spot!\" He then took my family and I (colored people ) all the way to the back of their restaurant which looked like a back room with a bunch of old tables & it looked nothing  like the front. On our way to the back of their place we walked past 3 empty tables and the front of the restaurant was really nice and full of Caucasian people. When we got to the back there was nothing but colored people - old tables and chairs and dirty silverware . This place practices segregation and it's no secret . It's disgusting."}
{"text":"Been going for over 16 years best breakfast in town hands down especially for me the eggs Benedict delicious never had better lots of sauce and wonderful home made potato chips. The lobster and shrimp omelette is loaded,first rate ."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE omelet fan, I can't get enough of them. And when in town why not give this place a try.  I was a little intimidated at the fact that they do not have hash brown, but that didn't keep me away. our order consisted of: -Popeye Omelet- spinach, mushrooms and cheese -Cowboy- chili -Carnitas- Well pork for you that don't speak ESPA√ëOL  -Everything but the kitchen sink- Literally EVERYTHING it was HUGE!!  They have the sharing charge. I do suggest this option if you do not eat alot since their portions are RIDICULOUSLY BIG.   We were all very satisfied. My only complaint on my omelet was the chili was a little watery. There was an accumulation of water in my plate, not a major factor but I do like my Chili on the thicker side.   Your meal comes with a complimentary side of bread, we all got pumpkin spice.   Overall it was Delicious!!!! ! can't wait to go back and visit my sister to have breakfast here.  Customer service: GOOD. **I do not rate on customer service."}
{"text":"This was like a fresh air breeze after a crappy New year celebration (everyone in a family was sick except me, duh!) Went there for a breakfast on January 1st with a slight headache (had to drink all that champagne by myself ughhh...). Their portions are huuuuuge - I mean I ordered an omelette and it looked like it was made out of at least 5 eggs :-) had to get a doggie box. And they were so nice to offer a coffee to take out. If I'm ever in Las Vegas again, I am totally eating breakfast there again."}
{"text":"My sister decided to take me to Omelette House because she wanted me to try the eggs benedict with lobster and hollandaise sauce.  She's been here several times, and it was one of her favorite spots.  The place was super crowded, and I was worried about the wait time.  Surprisingly, it was only a 20-minute wait.  So we sat down and looked at the menu while we wait.  Within 10 minutes we knew what we wanted and one of the waitress asked if we wanted to sit at the counter instead.  We wanted a booth, but why not?    At first it was kind of awkward sitting at the counter.  Within minutes, our waitress, Lola, came and took our orders for drinks.  She really made us feel welcome.  After speaking to her, we got a lot more comfortable.    We put in our order, waited, and watched all the orders that came by us.  Everything looked so good and amazing!  When our food arrived, I was so excited.  The hollandaise sauce was amazing.  Pair that with big chunks of lobster and I am so glad my sister found this place.  One of the best eggs benedict I have ever tried.  We also got waffle with bacons and eggs.  The waffle was crispy, but not hard, just the way I like it.  Waffles and bacon just goes hand in hand.  This is a great place to stop by if you're in Vegas!  It's about 25 minutes from the strip, located in Henderson.  It's worth the detour from the strip."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We were looking for a more local place to eat before we went back home after a weekend in Vegas. This place popped up on Google maps so we decided to give it a try. Everyone on the staff was extremely friendly. Instead of normal bread options of toast or English muffin, you also have the choice of banana nut or pumpkin bread. We both got the banana bread and it is DELICIOUS!! We ended up buying another piece to go. Our breakfast was also quite tasty; the taters are so good. The portion sizes range from perfect to huge depending on what you order. We got the scramble which was still too much food. We saw other tables with omelets that you could totally split and still have too much food. Anytime we are in the area, we are going to make it a point to stop by for breakfast. :)"}
{"text":"Great variety of omlettes.  Love the spuds (their version of hash browns).  Casual environment.  Not far off the strip and worth the drive.  Serves breakfast until 3:00 PM.  Also serves lunch."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!  Huge omelet selection and the pancakes are delicious too.  Don't miss out on the \"Farmer Juan\".  If you don't want an eight egg omelet, try the \"baby\" 3 egg-er.  The best part about this place is the service.  Real people working hard to fill your stomach quickly.  Gotta love it."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! We went a couple years ago & I just told my husband we need to go back to the place with that delicious pumpkin bread. I looked up breakfast and Vegas & it came up immediately!! Heading up next month, can't wait to go again! It had a real family feel to it, I remember it seemed like it was family ran & they had some pre-teens or teens helping out poring coffee & clearing dishes. I liked that, teach them young, good work ethics!"}
{"text":"Omelet House is a hidden treasure. The cozy down home feel makes you feel at home. The service was terrific and the food delicious. You leave with a full belly and happy."}
{"text":"Ok this is my first and last time too to Omelet House this is how my experience went..   Before pride it was about 8am in the morning and me and  the girls wanted some home cooked breakfast.. so we decided on Omelet house sounded good.. I was outside.. i could smell the food.. it smelled so good.. we walked inside told the lady table for 5 for a booth.. we waited like almost 10 min.. wasn't crowded.. the manager came over and seated us at the booth.. he was very sweet and i started off with some chocolate milk and some water with lemon.. waited like 5 min and we got our drinks perfect timing.. than i looked at the menu.. everything looked good but i was craving some good stuffed french toast.. there special stuffed french toast looked good..it came with 2 eggs..3 pieces of bacon and 2 sausage.. was $8.59 (around there) Sounded good but i wasn't that hungry so i found another french toast special for $7.39 it came with 2 pieces of french toast 2 eggs 2 pieces of bacon and 1 sausage. so i decided on that special..  took 15 min til the waiter FINALLY gets there..she was so rude to my gf.. she didn't even tell us her name.. she just says.. ya.. what can i get u.. not a good morning or anything.. (i forgot her name.. srry) I g ok.. i told her what i wanted and she says ok.. she was so sarcastic.. she didn't even look at me while she took my order.. whole entire time she was rude and bitchy too all of us while taking our orders.. so me vo and abby went too the manager and complained.. the manager told us that it wasn't the first time that this waitress got complained about.. so the manager had enough and fired her ass that day.. was glad too.. s Well after we complained anther waiter got us 2 plates of banana bread which was REALLY GOOD!!! The other waitress was laughing Little bit and said I'm so embarrassed i'm so sorry that happen.. than she left... We were having enough so we got a doggy bag what we didn't eat.. (I was s stuffed though the food was good though)   Right after we packed our food we asked for the check from the manager..The manager gave us 20% off of our $60.00 bill.. (if u ask me.. we should have gotten our meals for free how much we went though..) Right after i mean righter we got our bill the same waitress (the bitchy one..lol) came up too us.. having this kinky smile says.. u all have a good day and i left u a little something special on the bill.. she gives us another cold stair and walks away..    I never in my life has ever ran into such a rude and mean waitress.. I'm NEVER coming back here again.. even though there food was Really good.. there people there stinks.. i wish i could have been those customers who has a good experience here.. UGH!   that's why i give this place a 2 star.. give them a 2 star because they have a good food.. was just going to put 1.. but since they have good food i gave them 2.. Man I'm being too nice but that was my experiences.. I really hope u have a better time than i did.."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled turkey and avocado sandwich and boyfriend ordered the sassy chicken sandwich. Boyfriend liked his, but mine was bland. Portion sizes were large, and the homemade potato chips were so good. I would consider returning for breakfast.  The food is more diner type than fine cooking."}
{"text":"A little pricey but food is overall really good I would definitely recommend trying this place I know I will come back to try more stuff on the menu the level of service was great to they were very attentive"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service. Portions are more than adequate.  No kid's menu, but a regular meal could be split among the kids."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  In the mood for a hearty breakfast, my friends and I stopped in.  We were SO glad we did - huge omelet full of veggies, amazing stuffed french toast.  Crispy house fries, so delish.  If you're in the mood for a real breakfast and a down-home diner, this is the spot."}
{"text":"This place is almost always busy, which means it's worth the wait! The food never disappoints. The portion sizes are very big! Bring your appetite or be ready to split any meal. The service is always good. The joint is pretty clean too."}
{"text":"Wow. I was not expecting much but what a wonderful surprise. The huevos rancheros was epic and when I added chile verde, I'm seriously starting to question if my town of Santa Barbara can retain its crown of the best Mexican food. No kids menu but the prices are so reasonable, who cares!   Also amazing was the service. They brought ice for iced tea that needed a bit extra and without asking. No one does this. Thank you Dena. What a treat.   Flips flops absolutely"}
{"text":"First, I do not leave Yelp reviews.. until today. I just ate the single greatest breakfast of my life. I feel like I almost can't articulate how delicious this food was but I'm going to try. We came to Omelette house today for my birthday breakfast, we've been wanting to come for a while but just haven't, to start the staff was so friendly and courteous & fast! But not annoying rushed just prompt and caring but the real gem was THE FOOD! Okay.. so I ordered the lobster eggs Benedict thinking this sounds really yummy, at first sight I was in love with this damn masterpiece but then I took a bite.... this was no joke one of the single greatest bites of food I've ever had in my life. Eggs cooked perfectly, lobster mix bursting with lobster flavor, fresh sliced avocado ( like a whole avocado!) perfect English muffins and velvet sauce. The potato chips/ browns they serve with them are incredible and dudes, it was crazy great. I will be eating this regularly & blissfully the rest of my days. Total perfection."}
{"text":"While waiting for my car to get fixed, I stopped by this Omelet House. It has the cozy diner setting that is often difficult to find in Vegas. It reminds me of back home in the Midwest, where this kind of restaurant is common. It's the perfect place to grab breakfast, sip on a coffee, and lounge with family. The service was friendly, and our food came out fast.    Their corned beef is really good and so are their omelets. The plates are huge, so you can make more than one meal from the food. Or, if you have a smaller appetite, you can get a \"baby omelet.\" The menu really has something for everyone: omelets, pancakes, French toast, waffles, sandwiches, soup, salad, and burgers."}
{"text":"Lobster Omelettes were ok.  Ask for real eggs because I will next time.  The banana bread was really good and hot.  Orange juice is really good. Good little breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Great food Great service. We will be back when in Vegas. We had Stuffed French toast, biscuits & gravy!  It was amazing"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and a great price. Like eating at grandma's house. Fresh made bread was great. Make sure you go during grunion season so you can get a side of grunion lips."}
{"text":"It has been said that you're not an American until you leave America.   I sort of feel like you're not really a Californian until you leave California.   I'm not the healthiest eater in the world. I like greasy and meaty foods but I love fruits and vegetables. It seems that every time I leave my fair state, I am suddenly in a world where salads are made with iceberg lettuce and where steamed vegetables mean defrosted frozen peas with some ice still chilling on the top of the pile.   I'm not looking for a vegan dish here. I just want a little green on my plate. The legal kind.   The locals always know best. On our last trip to Vegas, my roommate recommended this place. She is a former Vegas resident.   First of all, there was no line when we walked in. We were seated right away.   Our waiter was extremely attentive. My lady's coffee was perfect. I kept getting the bottom of the pot.   I, obviously, wanted an omelet but which one? There were so many to choose from. At first, the health nut attracted me. Then I saw the Jolly Green Giant which came with spinach and broccoli. That is mine. i ordered it with a slice of ham.   The omelet was perfect. The potatoes were so good, my girlfriend kept eating them and she HATES potatoes. The ham still had a bone in it. That is always the BEST ham.   My lady got herself an incredible looking eggs benedict. It looked like the eggs were taking over the bread like Iraq invaded Kuwait.   We both had to take food home. You can be sure that the next time that I am in Vegas, I will be coming here."}
{"text":"I had the waffle and I did not like it - there was some really strong ingredient - I think too much vanilla extract and it wasn't crispy.  The eggs and bacon on the side were fine.  But, I tried my grandma's food and it was pretty good - she had the lobster eggs benedict with avocado - that was pretty good.  And her potatoes were interesting - like large cut fried potato chips with seasoning.  I think I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere. It was very welcoming. The service was great and the food OH MY!!  It was the first time that me and my husband didn't finish an omelette and it was so delicious!! I'm definitely coming back when I come to Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"We really love their fried potatoes.  The coffee is good, basic blend.  The place is like a throwback in time with it's mismatched, garage sale decor.  The service is fair and friendly.  food is good, with decent sized portions.  They are a truly local establishment, we have been doing there for years and several of their waitstaff are long timers.  That always speaks well for a company.  While it's fairly routine (basic good good) we have never had a complaint on either the service or the food."}
{"text":"Love this place.... One of the best in Vegas !!  I get the Omelet almost every Tuesday morning.... this place is a Las Vegas Institution!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place. Great food. Could easily split an omelet as they are huge.  Pumpkin bread is fresh made , warm and delicious  . Will return again."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast a Monday morning.  It was near noon, but they serve breakfast all day.  The place was pretty crowded and seems to be popular with older folks. It's very kitschy, but it has that old mom-and-pop diner atmosphere, and that type of menu as well.  We tried their stuffed French toast and their pancakes combos. The food was good, tasty enough, but not particularly outstanding or inspired.  Basically, this is your typical all-American breakfast joint.  Full review at http://www.marga.org/foodblog/2011/08/omelet-house-las-vegas-review/"}
{"text":"Nice retro d√©cor. Pretty architecture. Food great if you feel like omelettes and the potato chips that come with them are like homemade chips, portions so very generous I can see why you must take half of it to go."}
{"text":"Quirky hole in the wall! We came here on Sunday @ 10am (also Mother's Day). It was very crowded but there is ALOT of seating. I definitely thought there would be a wait but We were given a table immediately. It is a huge menu, obviously featuring omelets. There was about 30 omelets to choose from and a bunch of other breakfast options. The portions are enormous and there was maybe one healthy thing on the menu so I wouldn't suggest coming here if you're dieting. I got an omelet with chorizo, cheese and onions. Each entree comes with spuds which are basically potato chips. Wasn't sure how I felt about them at first but they grew on me. Could barely finish half of my omelet and should have gotten the baby size which is 1$ less. The restaurant is filled with random knick knacks and interesting collectible items. The staff was very sweet and attentive. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service was great, portions waaaay too large, chips for breakfast bad idea, but will go again just order different.  Food was very good."}
{"text":"I was visiting family in Henderson for the 4th of July week. We decided on breakfast at the Omelet House. My family is fond of the restaurant and food quality. I wanted to treat them for their hospitality. The bill came and I provided my credit card. I admit I should have reviewed the bill before signing the credit card invoice, but I didn't.  When I did look at the bill I noticed I had been charged .99 for salsa the server never provided. I had noticed that they seemed to be understaffed as earlier when my brother saw that the rye toast was marble rye and asked for a substitution, our server seemed frustrated, but smiled and brought him a biscuit instead.  When I pointed it out to our server she made a bit of a scene be offering to bring it to me though we had completed our meal. She then took a dollar out of her pocket and threw it on the table. I told her to reimburse herself through the cashier. She began to speak loudly about priorities and it only being a dollar. We tried to make a joke out of it as we were embarrassed by such behavior. She went on to tell everyone within hearing range that she had four children and counted every penny. She was obviously stressed, but her behavior was totally inappropriate. As a mother of four, Zi would suggest she is very observant about what she is charged. I'm retired and living on my social security benefits. A dollar is a big deal. I hope her management is able to connect with her to listen to her concerns rather than having her okay them off on the customers. Server #5 July 6,2017@ 8:56AM"}
{"text":"I got the Lox Benedict and the bf got the Cowboy Special Omelet.   I never thought breakfast could pack so much flavor but this place proved me wrong! It was just amazingly tasty right from the beginning.   The chili in the Cowboy Special was flavorful and had the right amount of spice without being too hot. Beans and finely ground beef in and delicious chili sauce all stuffed into this gigantic omelet that we couldn't finish - HEAVEN.   My Lox Benedict had the creamiest sauce on top of the softest muffin. The salmon was a great touch to the meal. I found myself using the extra potatoes that came on the side to finish up the sauce.   We also ordered banana bread that was piping hot when it was delivered to us. How can so much banana go into bread?????? What is this magic???????  Service here is friendly and has a home-grown feel to it. Save some money and come here to enjoy and chill breakfast that won't bust your wallet."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get breakfast in Henderson! Huge portions, good bang for your buck, and quite possibly the best cup of coffee I've had. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Full..and happy like a fat cat. Love me some french toast. The service is honest and friendly. Not a hoity toity place. Comfortable. The portions are huge. The food is comfort."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot when in Vegas. Coffee was amazing and so was the food. Omelets are cooked perfectly and the potatoes are like home made chips (get them extra crispy). Service was just how it should be, friendly, fast and funny. Coffee and water never empty."}
{"text":"Love this place. Whenever in Vegas it is worth the trip away from the strip for breakfast.  They give you a nice portion and the potato spuds and specialty bread served with every meal always hit the spot. The omelets are awesome too and you have plenty of choices. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fresh home cooked breakfast at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"At first the restaurant seemed a little unappealing. However once we were seated the staff was super nice and the food was phenomenal! We got lucky with our waitress who treated us with pure kindness. The food was way better than I expected. Great coffee and amazing food."}
{"text":"Large large large very large portions. I was so shocked at the portions and even more shocked at how cheap the bill was. The Omelets are amazing and I wish I had tried the french toast. I know that it would have been amazing. I am more than happy with our visit here. It was last minute and it is a hole in the wall that LOOKS tiny but is huge inside. Don't expect for it to look like a 5 star restaurant this is a very old and old fashioned establishment that apparently has to be appreciated for what its always been. My server was very very nice and I loved her personality. Its easy to judge this place if you have your panties in a bunch. The worst part about it was that there was a large soccer team there and there were a bunch of little girls and one of them decided she wanted to Laugh the ENTIRE TIME! All jokes aside, she laughed LOUDLY the ENTIRE TIME. It was overly annoying but it had nothing to do with the food, or the service there. :) I will probably go back one day, but I dont live out here."}
{"text":"Go here for breakfast, the 2 for $12 dinner deal sucks. The dinner proportions are small, it felt like some weight watchers ish. 1 scoop of mash potatos, a small fillet of whatever, and a table spoon of corn. This normally goes for $8.99? You gotta be joking me.  You're forced to buy two drinks at $2.59 a piece, so the bill came out at around $18. Omelet House always comes through with the monster massive omelets, so i was expecting something similar from their dinner entrees. nope. Ditch the dinner deal, or anything dinner related."}
{"text":"Great local joint.  Lots of food.  Had breakfast and it came with potatoes that were chips.  They had pumpkin bread with bfast which was awesome.  Looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"The service was the best part. Our waitress was awesome. From the outside, this restaurant doesn't look too promising but once you get your food, you'll realize not to judge a book by its cover. Inside it's really cozy. I actually didn't order an omelet, I had French toast and my company ordered Country Benedict. Both were awesome. The crazy on the Benedict tasted like it was made from scratch. I'll be returning here for sure"}
{"text":"The banana bread is a must! The omelets are big and yummy 6 eggs in each omelet two can share one plate.  The coffee could be stronger but it was good but the SERVICE IS THE BEST! Our waitress was Lulu she's a sweetheart she will make sure you leave happy."}
{"text":"It has been quite awhile since my four star review and I haven't been here in awhile. The food is still pretty much the same. Large servings of average food. The spuds are good, the dressing is fresh and the coffee is hot. The food has become nothing to exclaim over. The omelettes are good but way too big for me. They need a real kids menu to chose from with a better price point. But the servers usually do try to offer the mouse pancake. The gravy with their biscuits was quite good previously but now is tasteless. Frozen sausage patties didn't help.  The service is on point, with some of the same people still here from my original review. They always seem to check in now. Very friendly.  But my issue today is cleanliness. The tables were gross and the menus were sticky. It was clear that whoever was responsible for cleaning did not do it. On all the tables around us I was able to see that the settings had not been moved and it was disgusting around them. I was in a long booth and it looked as though the table was wiped off only as far as they could reach standing at the end. The dirt was so built up I could have scratched it with my nail. This was breakfast time so there was no excuse for the way the place looks. Both of our menus had syrup on them as well as other unknown sticky substances. Seems like people are slacking on that cleaning too. Because it isn't clean I am forced to only give two stars. Hopefully this can change soon."}
{"text":"Omelet House puts together a strong Midwestern style breakfast experience.  I stopped for a meal while in Vegas by direction of a colleague recently and was immediately transported to the Midwest by the feel of the menu and interior, even the friendly server made me wonder if I was in Minneapolis or Kansas City. The menu is enormous and offers just about any breakfast staple that you could imagine. It took considerable time to decide upon the Chili Verda Skillet Breakfast, something I figured I could not find at home in OC.   This Southwestern number combines Chili Verda served over home fried potatoes, onions, peppers, and Ortega chilies which is then topped with two eggs and Jack cheese. All killer, no filler and with a $9.49 price of admission, I would try it again happily.   The downers include a less that sterile environment in the dining area and disgusting bathrooms. Considering the locale, I am sure this isn't a deal killer locally but it drops a 4 star meal down a notch for this Yelper."}
{"text":"Every time we eat there the food is great!  We have ordered many different dishes and loved them all.  The service is ok,  not great though.  I had to ask for more water and coffee and they never came to get our plates after we boxed up our food."}
{"text":"The French toast we're not the same  and the bacon was greasy and small I  usually leave this place feeling very full  very dissatisfied after spending $50 but I guess I have to find another breakfast spot or even better eat at home it's healthier"}
{"text":"Has a million trinkets in the restaurant. Reminds me of someone that is a hoarder and smells kinda like an old persons home.   Sorry no pictures of food to show. The food was good, but all we got was breakfast plate. How can ya mess up pancakes, eggs and bacon? Ya can't."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place.  It brings in many different kinds of people happy and wanting to get their grub on.  Sometimes there is a wait but it goes quickly.  The waitresses are friendly and do their best to keep your coffee cup full.  The menu has every kind of breakfast item you could possibly want.  From many different kinds of omelets, egg, potato, meat with toast to biscuits & gravy to waffles, pancakes and fried zucchini sticks.  All of it's delicious and I have never had a bad meal.  This last time around I ordered up a Lobster Benedict.  The lobster was sweet and complimented by the delicious hollandaise sauce.  Forget about the corporate pancake insane asylum further south!  This place has character and is as warm as their pumpkin nut bread."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our Comedy on Deck tour for lunch and we had a great experience.  The food was delicious and the staff was very nice and friendly.  They accommodated our large group with ease."}
{"text":"A regular place to go and a regular place to bring out of town guests to show off our locals hideouts. The food and the price makes everyone want to come back. The omeletes are huge (6 egg) and are the standard plate size. If you'd like less, order \"the baby\" at only 3 eggs. But for a few coins more, I go regular size then have leftovers for lunch!  As everyone else has said; the banana bread & pumpkin bread are great! served both moist and warm. The potatoes are more like thick cut potato chips (but that isn't a complaint!!).  They've always managed to keep my coffee cup & water glass full.  It's a maze of rooms and filled nick-nacks. Look around at all the kitsch, you'll find something from your childhood. The hidden large back room is great for groups and children (I've seen balloon animal makers here, late mornings, on weekends). A side booth area for more of a coffee shop feel, and a main room that feels like tables have been set up in grandmas dining room.  I've seen local \"celebrities\" eating here & sometimes there's a short wait (when the after church crowd hits)."}
{"text":"Very laid back and unassuming decor but they have great home style cooking! I came at 10am on a Sunday and my party of two was sat immediately although they were starting to fill up. The banana bread I ordered with my meal was brought out first and was very good. I had the Bugsy Siegel omelette with egg whites which was one of the best omelettes I've EVER had. There were tender roast beef chunks in a savory Italian red sauce with creamy sour cream and lots of cheese. Their signature potatoes are thin crispy slices that are a cross between potato chips and home fries. I also added a pancake which was huge and fluffy--like a larger version of an ihop pancake. Melia took great care of us as well. Overall this was a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place from 1-10, it would be 12!!!  Excellent home style cooked meals!! Lots of items to choose on the menu but my two favorites are the homemade corned beef hash and the chicken fried steak breakfasts!!!  I can hardly ever decide which one....  Their daily made pumpkin bread is served so warm and yummy!!! And their coffee tastes great!!  If I could eat there often, I would, but then I'd be 400 lbs., so I save it for special occasions because I know I'll always come out more than satisfied!!  Ask for Cathy... She'll treat you like family!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and they have been open since 1979! Never too late. I'm in love with their corned beef hash! Nick our server was amazing"}
{"text":"We been coming here for many years, and when its good ... its super good. Potato spuds are golden brown where sometimes is soggy and dark brown. Pumpkin bread is always very good. Owner is very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous omelet (#34) at the Omelet House. A word of caution, they make their omelets a with SIX (6) you read that right, eggs. Share if you dare. Excellent food, excellent service. I highly recommend.   We ate at the Boulder Highway location, but since they are all owned by the same family, expect consistency."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. The six egg omelet is enough for two! Their potatoes are like potato chips but better.  Their stuffed French toast is really thick and stuffed with apples or blueberries."}
{"text":"Timm is a fantastic server lots of personality. The food was fantastic and the portions are huge. I would suggest you take the time to have breakfast here before you leave for the long drive back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of the best omelets I've eaten. Cooked correctly, eggs not overdone. I ordered the Health Nut omelette with banana bread. The bread warm and added butter to it. It was a great start to the breakfast. I also ordered the smaller portion which was still too much for me to eat. I added bacon to my omelet and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Boulder Hwy location is our favorite!!! Best food and the waitresses are the sweetest. Love the breads and the way they cook their eggs!"}
{"text":"With a gazillion omelet options, this place is a lot of fun.  They have pumpkin and banana nut bread! Very friendly, fast service."}
{"text":"Really, really like this place from the food to the artwork and memorabilia.  We had the banana bread and pumpkin bread. So good and the butter took it over the top. Omelette was good.  The chicken fried steak was okay.  The service was pretty fast."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast/lunch spot in Vegas!! Everything, not just the omelettes, is so DELISH!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat breakfast in Henderson! The prices are amazing for the amount and quality of food that you get. I have eaten here a lot and have never had a bad experience, service is excellent and fast and the food is incredible!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and service was prompt, you also get a 15% discount if you stay at the Siena Suites hotel across the street."}
{"text":"Excellent ham and cheese omlette. Ordered the 3 egg and it was a hugh portion. I would hate to see the 6 egg! There potatoes have great seasoning. Great service. Hometown, mom and pop shop feeling."}
{"text":"It's a cute concept. It has a mom and pop type feel. It's similar to an ihop/Denny's. It's mostly a breakfast/brunch spot. The food is pretty good. They have so many options. The menu is absolutely huge. The only issue I really ran into was that our waitress didn't tell us our Benny's come with potato so we ordered fries too. once we realized we had all this extra potato we asked to have the fries taken back. Our waitress seemed so upset.  I mean you could of mentioned it comes with it. Regardless it was still a decent experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy chicken skillet and the meat lovers skillet, both were below average. The potatoes were underseasoned, as well as their chicken. The food tasted so bland, we couldn't even finish the food, sadly. The banana nut bread was close to dry and on the saltier side rather than sweet. However, the staff were great and friendly! Best part about the meal was the water."}
{"text":"Holy Cow!!! When Siri gave us this place as s suggestion, I pictured the typical roadside diner. Was I wrong!!  Apple pie inside an omelette??? No way! But I had to try and it was incredible... And more than I could eat. The pumpkin bread alone could have been my meal, but the omelette and fries were plater sized and most filling. My Lady had the blueberry stuffed French Toast, and finished it all... Usually I get to eat her leftovers but there were none.  If you're nearby and hungry, don't pass this one. Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"FOOD: 5 Stars SERVICE: 5 Stars Atmosphere: 5 Stars   This place will make you gush with Love, Joy, Happiness, ETC lol. EVERYONE there has got to be some of the nicest and happiest people I've ever met. I saw 4 different servers greet the same \"regular\" there and all were so happy to see him! I also saw the manager compliment this guy on how amazing of a person that guys wife was haha.  Service was amazing. I never saw the bottom of my cup of of coffee and never had to ask for a refill because they were on top of it.   I ordered the homemade corned beef hash and eggs. On their menu it says \"best you ever had\". That is 100% accurate lol. Literally the BEST corned beef hash I've ever had. This place is going to be a tradition every time I go to Vegas. Every plate comes with homemade potato chips too!  My friend ordered their vegetarian omelette which was almost the size of a football lol she finished half and loved it. You can also opt in to get the smaller portion for a dollar less."}
{"text":"We finally got to try this place for breakfast through our friend's invitatition.  The place is huge and although the place has aged, it has kept its charm and grandma would approve.    There were 13 of us and our server Megan was so accommodating and definitely made for a pleasant dining experience.  I shared the chicken fried steak omelet with pepper jack.   The omelet was huge, but I found the egg to be overcooked which forced me to eat around it.  It seems to me like they concentrate more in bigger and not better.    The plate also came with sliced potatoes which I believe were intended to be served either crispy or soft but not in between.  I did enjoy them however, but I think it was more my love for potatoes. Then you have a choice of their toast selection or a slice of their homemade pumpkin or banana nut bread.  Pricing isn't bad considering you can split your plate which I did, but they failed to mention there is a $1 charge for doing so.  I can see why, since the portions I am sure prompt people to do so more often than not, but my thing has always been not being made aware of it by our server.  Whether or not it is mentioned somewhere you should still be told by your server.      Overall I liked how accommodating they were for our large party and offered to split checks for us without having to ask which was very nice for a change since most eating establishments frown upon this practice which is pure laziness when they hesitate or refuse to do so.   As for the food though, I still think I can cook better eggs and yet I am not a cook."}
{"text":"What a find!! Sometimes I get tired of eating at chain restaurants in Henderson, or at the ever present casino....thank the egg gods for O.H.  I appreciated the well ventilated interior, not too chilly (man you folks sure do like your AC) and silly art/memorabilia was perfect for my early breakfast mood.    So for food I ordered the smaller portion option---AND still took home most of my omelet. I opted for the slab of pumpkin bread and by the time I was done with that, I really had no room for food. Mind you, the left over chorizo-cheesy goodness that was my omelet was amazing the next day.  I cant recall what my 2 companions ordered (I know, lame) but what ever your taste, O.H has it!!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service. Everyone was friendly. The meals come with \"spuds\" and homemade pumpkin or banana bread. About a 5-10 minute drive from the strip depending on where. Easy parking too."}
{"text":"This place should be called Kathy's she was a amazing server, I felt like I was home in my kitchen enjoying breakfast. The food was good oh so good. It would not been as good if not for the exceptional and constant sincere service from KATHY !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is going to end up being my go-to breakfast nook, for sure.   Tons of other five-stars here, so not much to add.  I kept taking a pass on trying this place because it looked too much like a deep-South, good-ol-boy, food-as-fuel Waffle House unit. Big mistake.  Then the RJ spotlighted it so I gave it a go.  The quality is excellent, the menu-choices are many (about 40 different omelet choices) ... and the portions are Godzilla-gigantic!!   Prices are quite fair, given the quality and portions.  A wee bit of sadness; only open from 7am to 3pm.  Turns out everyone from Mayor Goodman to Bill Clinton to Jerry Seinfeld (for his 'Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee' series) has dined one of Vegas' three Omelet Houses at some point or another.   And I say with good reason.  You'd have to be at least slightly insane to pass this joint up in favor of an IHOP or Denny's.  Adios casino coffee shops, arrivederci Peppermill Diner ... aloha Omelet House!"}
{"text":"Went around 11:30ish and was not packed like I usually see when I drive by. We were seated right away, they sat us in what seemed like the way back, it's a lot bigger than I thought. We were greeted and asked what we wanted to drink right away. About 5 minutes later the server took our orders and our food was out in less than 10 minutes, I was actually surprised how fast the food came out. I got the California omelette with bacon instead of sausage (and when I asked for that I wasn't given attitude about the change) the cowboy special was the other omelette ordered and it smelled SO GOOD, I had a little taste and it tasted as good as it smelled! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for omelets when in Las Vegas (unless you're getting comped at one of the hotels!). An abundance of food, and the \"spuds\" are the best chip style potatoes I have ever tasted! The omelets are made from a half dozen eggs. Both the pumpkin bread and the banana bread are excellent as a choice (although I think I prefer the banana bread). And the best part of all, they are not at all overpriced for the amount of food that one gets on their plate! If you can't choose among the 38 different omelets they offer on the menu, you can bring the whole family and order the \"Flatlanders Special\" (#33-A). Their menu does have a second side with lunch offerings (not open for dinner), some of which I'll try for in the future. BTW: 2 for 1 coupon in the Entertainment book - Even Better!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots to go to after working a 12 hour shift and not eating lunch the whole time.  Just looking at the menu makes you all so full already. Menu contains all sorts of dishes from breakfast to lunch, from Mexican to polish.  Definitely something new to try each time you come.  This place gives excellent service.  When I'm eating here it feels as if I'm eating at my lola's (grandma) house with all the antique collections.  The feel is very warm and cozy.  As soon as you come in to the door you're greeted right away and seated.  So many people come and go.  Only thing, worst time is around 8am. All medical students come and eat breakfast there.  But as quickly as they seat you and you order...your food comes in less than 10 minutes!   As for the food, I had the \"egg white special.\" not your typical breakfast size.  Even when you split the food, your plate is still overflowing! I like how their potatoes are like chips...quite different!  Most of all, the favorite to have here is their pumpkin nut bread. Comes warm and fresh from the oven. Every time you come, it's must!  Over all, excellent and quick service, great and delicious food and cheap prices!!!"}
{"text":"Biggest omelettes and a homey atmosphere! Great French Toast!!! This place is a gem for breakfast. If you go here and aren't amazed I will be shocked!"}
{"text":"A delicious old school breakfast place full of history.  I have eaten at other OH's in the past but none have the character and style of this particular location.  I have turned the other cheek of gluttony and went for a more modest breakfast.  My coffee cup was never empty.  When in the area would happily stop by again."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancakes were the best I have ever had. Amazing texture that had the perfect amount of crisp. Sweet enough to avoid syrup altogether. An absolute gem!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast spot in town! The food is delicious, and they give your large portions! On top of that your glass will never be half empty, which my husband loved since he drinks so much water! The staff was kind and efficient! Our food arrived quickly and was delicious! I ordered the breakfast sandwich lunch special on rye bread and a banana nut bread slice on the side! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very good food here. Was in the area and hadn't eaten here before. Great atmosphere and very nice bartenders. Would highly recommend. They originally had a problem accommodating all 8 of us, but we were quickly tended to and had a great night!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go even when I was young. I loved the pickled jalape√±os burger with the spuds and mustard on the burger."}
{"text":"I love all of the Omelet Houses.  Potatoes are super yummy.  I had a simple egg over hard with toast and a chili omelet, both excellent.   Coffee is good."}
{"text":"Biggest and best omelet you will ever have.  Comes with delicious bananna bread (or pumpkin bread if u choose.). Also comes with amazing potatoes sliced thin."}
{"text":"So good! Food is tasty, portions are big and staff are super nice and friendly. I had the Lobster Eggs Benedict, and it was so good - the side chips are amazing! I also like the cozy atmosphere. Definitely a gem and I'm glad we checked it out."}
{"text":"I can't believe I lived in Vegas for almost 20 years and I just found this place. Now I'm not a huge omelette guy but oh my God. A buddy of mine took me here last week and I already returned the next day lol. Had the cowboy on the first day chili was amazing the banana bread was really really good as well came back the next day had a 357 that one was amazing too tried the pumpkin bread and loved it. Get there early the place fills up fast service was good they're running from table to table to table so they do the best they can. I will definitely return to this one and try some more of their tasty treats."}
{"text":"Great place! We got seated right away, our waitress was great. Customer service was top notch. The food was delicious. Recommend the banana nut bread."}
{"text":"Few minutes away from home and serves breakfast food, I'm there! I've actually been here a few times but most recent visit was my fave so far.  Came in close to 11am, waited a few minutes for someone to greet us and then was sat right away.  My friend and I shared the B.B.C - Broccoli, Bacon and Cheese Omelet. Comes with a side of their really yummy, perfectly seasoned and cooked, breakfast spuds -- shaped like chips, crispy outer with soft inside AND choice of bread, we chose to have the freshly baked, warm, banana bread. Very good! I was happy they didn't have it overly cooked like the previous times. Omelet had the right amount of bacon and broccoli in it -- also the egg was light and fluffy.  Portions are HUGE! They do offer a \"Baby Omelet\" for the smaller appetite but it's only $.89 less, IMO, you might as well buy the bigger portion and just take it home!  LOTS of breakfast items to choose from, including about 35+ different omelets. They also have lunch items like soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches, and a couple entrees.   This place hits the spot if looking for a breakfast joint, def better than Denny's or IHOP."}
{"text":"Easily 5 stars.  I had the Loch Ness omelette and a waffle.  I am coming back here, they were both amazing"}
{"text":"Everyone has been raving about Omelet House lately. My mother in law brought the whole family down here as a birthday celebration for my husband and other members of the family. I have to give it to the restaurant that they were very accomadating to our large party and they had Spanish speaking staff available as some of our family don't speak English. It was a comfortable experience for them.   However, I personally was less than impressed. I have more of a sweet tooth than the rest of the family and have been trying to watch my weight, so I ordered a short stack of pancakes. The portion was huge! Don't get me wrong, it's not a complaint and I was happy to eat more than my fair share and make a cheat meal out of it. I'm not sure if it's because this restaurant specializes in omelets, but if you offer something on the menu, you should be comfortable serving it to customers right. The pancakes were nasty and so sour. Tasted like they were made with rotten milk. I really should have sent them back, but didn't want to make a scene in front of family.   If I were ever to go back, I would go for the omelets, but nothing else. Everyone else really enjoyed their meal. Wish I would have had the same experience."}
{"text":"my favorite breakfast place!!!  the omelets are always perfectly made, love the spuds that come with it :-) lately i've ordered the eggs benedict and by far this place makes the best one, the eggs are perfectly cooked, the ham is big enough that it covers the whole english muffin. the hollandaise is delicious!!!   the omelets are big enough that sometimes me and hubby need to share but if you don't wanna share they do have a  3-egg omelet which is perfect. they can also half the big order of omelet if your sharing.   customer service is perfect everytime we go, always the same ladies and gentleman that help us, only a few times that we ask for our coffee to be refilled but they're always on top of that.    we did try there lunch menu which is also delicious.  the onion rings are my favorite, batter is nice and not too much, its crispy, hardly any oil. the chicken fingers and spuds are perfectly cooked as usual.  hubby got the meatloaf sandwich, which was alright, it did have too much bread, the meatloaf seems as if its not homemade but we've never asked the fries were delicious though."}
{"text":"Love this place it never fails!! Eggs Benedict on point! And the spud potatoes are so good!"}
{"text":"Whats NOT to love? HUGE portions! great food,so many selections to choose from and if it's not on the menu, they will make it your way. Place is big, clean, easy to get around in. The wait time is usually not long. All I can say is BE HUNGRY when you get here, as they are going to load you up:) Price? Not bad for what you get. If you are looking for a $3.99 breakfast this is NOT the place for you, plan on about $7-10 per person. This is a regular haunt for us, has been for years."}
{"text":"Seriously, breakfast here is a heavenly experience.  Lol. Huge portions, so don't go there if you're on a diet. This place is always busy, but the service is great. Pretty decent prices too."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! The service is fast and friendly, the food is AMAZING and I always have to get a doggy bag. I would definitely take a client here if they were looking for great breakfast and a small town feel!"}
{"text":"I have eaten breakfasts there for over three years.  They serve a very large breakfast menu, and it's all delicious. I like to have something different each time I go.  Gene Hayes"}
{"text":"Now that I hopefully have management's attention with the three stars, I just want to say that the food, the service, and the ambience in this place are wonderful. The only problem with this place is that plastic straws are given out automatically. By not using plastic straws, we can reduce the amount of contamination plaguing our world. I hope that the Omelet House and other restaurants will consider illuminating plastic straws and swizzle sticks and drinks."}
{"text":"Been to multiple OH's around the valley and found the food all prepared to a very high standard.  One could order a #12, \"The Toadstool\" omelet with delicious saut√©ed mushrooms and cheese at any of the OM's and receive the same quality chow where ever you go.  On this particular outing I knew that I should have had my head examined because I know the area and I don't particularly care for it.  My experience pretty much confirmed why I feel that way; Boulder north of Sunset can get a little hairy.  First off, as previously stated,your gonna get decent tasting chow.  OH's have a great menu that appeals to just about every breakfast, brunch and lunch seeker.  This OH is clean and the staff is friendly, even though they didn't listen to the finer details of my order.  Worrying about your vehicle or if your going to be accosted by one of the trolls prowling north to south and back along Boulder High Way, will impede the digestive process.  Be sure to lock your car and have your head on a swivel either entering or exiting this establishment."}
{"text":"Menu is bountiful, fits any taste, or appetite  Anything you could eat for breakfast, lunch,brunch, appetizers, dinner, desserts Portions overflow, always enough to share Take out, order in Fresh, flavorful Can order menu items to fit any taste or diet So many menu items to choose and mix and match Inviting welcoming atmosphere   people Family friendly  Great service Love"}
{"text":"We came here for a big, yet intimate, diner feel and we got just that! It's a great place to come chill in the morning, especially given how hectic Vegas can be.   The servers were amazing and attentive, always being around to fill my mug with much needed, delicious coffee.   We got their zucchini sticks, chile omelet, and huevos rancheros. The food was great with the omelet TO DIE FOR. I recommend getting it with a side of their fresh zucchini or banana bread!   Their prices are extremely reasonable, especially considering the rip-offs you will undoubtedly find on the Strip. It is definitely worth driving out to!"}
{"text":"Land of BIG food!   Come hungry.   Tucked away in an obscure location this is definitely a gem.  Homemade potato chips are pure genius."}
{"text":"This was a surprise.  The food was great and the service was great.  The Omelet number 33.5 was hilarious.   The potatoes were a pleasant surprise, like thick potato chips.  Plenty of food and a clean restaurant.  We will be eating here again when we come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and great service!  I had visited the other location just down the road.  I wanted to see if this was comparable.  Thankfully the food is just as good with friendly service.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  The location is older than the other.  Probably could use an update inside including their seats.  Our waitress was really attentive as well as other staff. I don't think my coffee cup went below the half mark at any point.  That always makes me happy.    I chose the Loch-Ness Monster omelet.  This omelet has shrimp, avocado and cheddar cheese.  I think they put too much avocado and not enough shrimp but it was still tasty.  I do love their style of breakfast potatoes served on the side.  Plus these are piled high and I can't bee finish them all.  It also comes with toast or one of their homemade breads. The pumpkin bread is served warm and was delicious!   I think Omelet House does a good job and I always enjoy breakfast here!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Old fashioned decor with excellent food!!! Make sure you go early as this place gets Crowded fast"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We went there on a Sunday for brunch. Even though they were busy we only waited 10 minutes for a table. The service was excellent. Fast on bringing out the food and our coffee never went cold. I had the country fried steak and even though it's a huge portion I manage to finish the whole thing! I love that the potatoes it comes with are potatoes chips. The pumpkin bread and banana bread are also made in house."}
{"text":"Great breakfast that is off strip, but worth the drive. Lots of various home made style foods to pick from and the banana nut bread is yum."}
{"text":"Worse serves the host was awesome but the server was terrible. She was rude and my daughter was a little cranky made us feel very unwelcome and rushed us to leave will not be back would rather just go to the Cracked Egg more welcoming and way better food. FYI hire way better servers you have great host but terrible servers that act like they don't want to be at work."}
{"text":"Food was good, big portions. Value was good for the amount off food.  People were friendly."}
{"text":"It is just okay. The portion size and food is really not worth the money you pay for it."}
{"text":"Come here hungry!    We stopped in for a hearty breakfast.  They did not disappoint! We were seated immediately to start browsing the delicious items on the menu.  Our server was ok. It wasn't the best of service (especially towards the end of the meal) but it was fine.  Sometimes he'd disappear and wouldn't see him for a while.  Oh well.  The food made up for it...  I know I was at the 'Omelet' house but I decided on the Cinnamon Apple Stuffed French Toast.  Oh yum.  It was fully stuffed with apples and cream cheese. I loved it! My husband chose the 38 special omelet.  This was probably the largest omelet I've seen.  It was filled with ham, bacon, sausage and cheese.  The sliced breakfast potatoes were awesome.  I loved the flavor in every bite.    I'll definitely come back for the food and just hope for a little better service.  :-)"}
{"text":"So much good food. Staff was great. Thank you for the hospitality! They're only open 0700-1500 so get there before. Overall good food and portions are huge."}
{"text":"Who cannot stop at the Omelet House?  It like the old time truck stop/ diner.  In fact I think the booths are from the 70s.   Service is good with them taking your drink order as you sit down.  The chip sliced potatoes are tasty but hit and miss if you like them all crispy.  Omelets are big and we usually end up splitting one but the big decision on which one to split.  If you go on your birthday you get a free meal."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 25 years and the food has always been consistently good.  Seating and service is fast and courteous. I will continue to go here into the future"}
{"text":"Wow... Strikingly mediocre. The portions are gargantuan... I left over half of it on the plate. The service was cordial but not impressive. It was ok... Just not something I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Wack is the word that comes to mind from my experience here.   Walking in this place is country cute and felt like an old grandmas home, I enjoyed the very cozy atmosphere.   As we sat down we ordered two orange juices and as they were brought over by a young kid they both slipped out of his hands (maybe because he was attempting to carry 2 waters & 2 juices at the same time). All 4 drinks landed on my lap...down my legs and into my ballerina flats. What a way to start a Sunday morning off! FML!  After basically washing my ass & legs in the bathroom and my ballerina flats now squishy from taking a full bath I was pretty bummed. I decided to stay because this place was bookmarked forever & I was really hungry for some great breakfast food. I need to also point out everyone apologized & the manager came over & said my breakfast was on him. That helped but now I'm sitting here soaking wet.   We ordered banana nut & pumpkin bread which were both great. I ordered a Black Forest ham omelet & it was massive. Unfortunately I took a few bites & was over it. The entire thing was in a puddle of grease & butter and there must have been a pound of Swiss cheese on this thing. Just a bunch of thick wads of cheese everywhere. So gross and it felt like a heart attack on a plate, no thanks. My man did enjoy his polish sausage & eggs and luckily my plate was free because it would have really sucked to pay for that.  Here's the worst part. After getting 4 cups spilled directly onto my lap they didn't charge me for my food however they charged my man for his and guess what, they also charged us for the drinks. What a joke. I could definitely get over the accident but to be known for the omelette's here and to have one of the shittiest omelette's I've ever had was too much.   Next time when you spill anything on your customers, just a piece of advice DON'T CHARGE THEM for what was spilled on them. Common sense..."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever received. I am a server on the strip and working in a customer service related environment I know how you should treat a customer and I got none of that. From the moment we walked in the hostess was rude and accompanied the waiter in making this the most uncomfortable stay here. I will never return to this place and I'll be sure to let people know how my experience here was."}
{"text":"Breakfast eggs are good and they serve awesome papas.  The banana bread and pumpkin bread are both tasty!  YUMMMMMM"}
{"text":"The charm of an old diner  -  something you don't get much of here las vegas with most of our restaurants consisting of multi-million dollar celebrity chef build outs or some corporate conglomerate.  So an independent is great to have.  Service is always friendly and your coffee never runs empty.  They also figured out the simplistic nature of food and beverage - cold food served on cold plates, hot food on hot plates and its all served with a smile.  Most restaurants can't figure that basic part out...  So on with the food - OH is the best independent free standing breakfast in the valley.  If you want a more refined breakfast, spend a bunch of time parking, walking through a casino, spending 5 times more, and dealing with a las vegas strip-union-pompous attitude server - read my other reviews.  But OH breakfast is very good - from there fresh breads, to their omelets, pancakes and my newest favorite - Lobster Benedict.  This Benedict comes with a good 4-5 ounces of lobster and its under $10!  Absolutely delicious and I'm not sure if I will ever order anything else on their menu.  I can't wait to go back and to eat it again."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm impressed! Food is really good, the omelets are huge (six eggs!) and the ingredients very fresh and tasty. The prices are pretty fair. And the decor with all the roosters.. perfect  Our server Priscilla is superb! I have been to many restaurants where the servers have been pleasant but this lady is different.. she's simply awesome.. and very well spoken. Definitely a little restaurant we'll be coming back to anytime we're in Vegas. Certainly recommend it!"}
{"text":"After a long night of partying, I awoke with a hangover that was demanding to be fed with some good breakfast food. Since I don't know my area too well, I decided to see what Yelpers recommended for breakfast close to me. Omelet House popped up and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot. I called in an order of blueberry stuffed french toast, with 2 eggs, and 2 slices of bacon. It was ready when I got there to pick it up and all of the food was still piping hot when I got home. Everything that I ordered was delicious, it definitely helped the after effects of my indulgence in spirits from the night before. The best part about the entire meal was the pumpkin bread I warmed up later on for a snack. I usually make my own breakfast but any time I'm not feeling up to it (especially after a night of drinking), Omelet House will be my breakfast restaurant of choice."}
{"text":"I came here not realizing that I came by here one time before on my last trip to Las Vegas.  Being an out of towner, I found this place through Yelp the last time and found it again through Yelp, without realizing that I've been here before.  Both times, I was very happy with the choice.  It's a breakfast / brunch type place with good food.  The ambiance is very fitting.  You'll find a very eclectic mix of people.  I had three OLD people next to me, a gay couple across the room, and a bunch of families and younger couples too.  The decor is all wood paneled in a woodsy cabin from the west sort of look.  I liked it.  It's simple and clean.  The location is about 3.5 miles from the mid-strip and a short car-ride away.  It's in a strip mall with nothing going for it from the outside.  It's got a cheesy \"Voted Best Breakfast\" banner outside and from the looks of it, you'd never tell that it's crowded and popular inside.  I got the egg white omelet and a pancake.  The omelet comes with your choice of toast, pumpkin bread, and banana nut bread.  I chose the last one and it came piping hot and really tasty.  I put butter on it and ate it up.  It was also a good sized.  Everything was good sized.  The omelet was huge and tasty and perfectly done.  The side was potatoes thinly sliced like chips but more soggy like fries.  I liked it.  The pancake was also tasty and perfectly prepared.  It was like 9 inches across and 1 would be more than enough for most people.  I had to take it to go after finishing my omelet.  This place is good for American breakfast food prepared right at very reasonable prices.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking for exactly that."}
{"text":"Went with the corned beef hash which wasn't as salty and I appreciated. The brisket is all homemade and was great. Tons of people while they first open so if you want slower traffic, go an hour before they close. Great service, friendly and always checking for refills. For the price and servicing size was decent. Wouldn't go out of my way to visit again, but would if I were in the neighborhood. Parking is a bit limited."}
{"text":"OMG!  The biscuits and gravy are the BOMB!!!! The potatoes are blissfully delightful!   Shhhhhh! A gem find"}
{"text":"one New Year's resolution is to write more Yelp reviews, so here goes...  In Vegas for NYE & gave this place a shot per other Yelp reviews. I had the chicken fried steak (which is pretty much my favorite breakfast) & the girlfriend had huevos rancheros (didn't try but looked good). Overall, the food was very good & the place has quite the kitschy ambiance. I prefer chicken fried steak to be an actual cut-of-meat steak rather than a ground steak product. The former is rare & this place served the latter. The gravy, however, was distinctively outstanding & the potatoes, served as home-style chips, were pretty good too. If you're looking for breakfast in Vegas & not in the mood for the $50 buffet with the obligatory gluttony that accompanies it, Omelet House is a very good, much lower cost option that still serves up ample portions."}
{"text":"The tragically shabby and nondescript Vegas strip malls make LA's look like Manhattan commercial blocks, but there's one that houses Omelet House--and dang, they serve some of the best \"homemade\" corned beef hash I've ever had. The unique chips and delish pumpkin bread sides along with the perfect over easy eggs help make everything stick to your ribs. Coffee was ok--reminded me of that brand you find in bad motels--\"Chock full o' nuts\"?. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Portionen sind riesig. Schmecken tut es auch sehr gut. Zu jedem Getr√§nk gibt es standartgem√§√ü ein Glas Wasser dazu. Au√üerdem werden Getr√§nke wie Softdrinks und Kaffee unendlich ohne Aufpreis nachgef√ºllt. Sehr zu empfehlen. Freundliches Personal."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! Stop thinking the now OVERPRICED hotel buffets are best when you are in LV ! Yelpers directed me here and they did not disappoint ! Hubby had the Mile High omelet which he said was full of good ham in between smacks! He also wishes he had got the junior as the regular size was huge! If you have kidsI suggest they split a junior. Petunia omelet is loaded with crisp bacon...take your BP meds people!! The spuds are crispy, more of a good potato chip than a hash brown but quite tasty. Waffle is light and fluffy with warm syrup! Ooooh the BANANA BREAD... Trust any Yelpers who advise you to get this it is warm, full of nuts you must get it there and extra to go for later!!!!  Just Gooo!"}
{"text":"WOW ! What a delicious surprise... Had a late breakfast (1pm) with a friend, had an opening cup of chowder, KILLER GOOD, lots of clam, shrimp and even had some crab (rivals Mo's Famous chowderhouse on the Oregon coast !).... then had the California omelet, fluffy, LOTS of avocado, sausage and cheese, MMM-MMMM ! ... Delicious and bigger than HUGE ! (6 eggs !!!). Had to take half of it home. Great waitstaff, great atmosphere and decor, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Luv luv luv the food. I live for their banana cake/bread. Big portions. You definitely get your money's worth. My fav breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"The banana nut bread is worth the trip. The coffee doesn't suck. Ask for milk for your coffee: half and half that lasts 3 months in the fridge. The omelet I ordered, Swiss cheese, mushrooms, onions is huge! Side of potatoes cross between home fries and potato chips.  This place is so in the middle of nowhere but it seems a destination from throughout Henderson. I was grateful it was down the street from where I needed to be; served in a timely manner so I wasn't late.  They have another outlet in Las Vegas, I think."}
{"text":"We have been coming to the Omelet House on Charleston for years.  We always get great food and service at a reasonable price.  The Bugsy Siegel has long been my favorite omelet.  The place gets very busy on the weekend but the staff does a good job serving everyone and we have never had to wait long for our food.  There are so many trendy breakfast places but the Omelet House is great and thankfully has not joined the trendy breakfast movement."}
{"text":"I eat here for breakfast about twice a month with a good friend and we both enjoy the food and service very much. I've tried several different omelettes and have been happy with my choice every time. The french toast is really good too, and the Eggs Benedict are as good as any place you go. Lots of options to choose from and the service is always friendly. I'm offered refills for my coffee a minimum of 5 times."}
{"text":"Best french toast! Yum.  Friend had the lobster benedict and is raving!  Want to eat where the locals eat?  This is the place.  No frills.  Doesn't look pretty on the outside.  But get inside and the staff is friendly and helpful and the meals are delicious.  Big portions.  Left completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Great French toast. Yummy waffles. And they know how to provide good old fashioned customer service.  I had bacon, eggs over easy and sourdough toast with a slice of French toast just to try because our waitress said it was her absolute favorite thing on the menu. Great bacon...not thin and not thick-just right and delicious.  My wife had one the their famous Omelets with Swiss cheese and avocado - the avo was both inside and out and was perfectly ripe.  Our local friend (it was her first time here) had a waffle with scramble eggs and bacon.  Our meals came with those homemade potato chippy things with garlic salt everyone on yelp talked about. All I'll say here is we all enjoyed them. My wife ordered hers without salt and were a tad underdone- but the owner overheard her telling us and insisted on fixing it by bringing another plate filled with those delicious potatoes.  The coffee was ok. I prefer supper dark full bodied coffee, but I was there for good eats and the coffee was totally drinkable.  We all took home leftovers. Next time I'd like to share a meal! So in the end we paid $55 including a generous tip, ate three meals and have three \"leftovers\" meals for later.  WE WILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"We are from Portland Or we stopped on our way to the Hoover Dam. The service is friendly and its a busy restaurant which was a good sign. I ordered the corn beef hash and eggs. When the food came it looked delicious. The potatoes (hash browns) we so good the corn beef hash the best I ever ate. The rye bread was fresh and full of flavor. I will definitely be back to try something else on the menu"}
{"text":"Never disappointed, this place is right near my house! Good service and solid food! My breakfast of choice after a long night or a long week!"}
{"text":"We were driving through Vegas and stayed overnight on a trip to Zion & Bryce. It was so good we made a point to eat here again on the way back home.   On the first visit, I ordered the Corned Beef Hash, and my wife ordered the Eggs Benedict. It was when I tested her dish that I decided we were hitting this place again. I'm not much of an egg person, and I find that most restaurants just don't do them to my liking. But these were heaven.   The hash was real, house-made corned beef hash, and it was damn good too, but the Eggs Benedict... whew! Easily the best eggs Benedict I've had.   Our second visit was on a Sunday, not particularly early in the morning, maybe about 10:30ish, and the service wasn't quite as friendly as the first visit, but to be fair, the service was still snappy, the personality of the server was a bit annoying. Nothing I'd knock the restaurant for.   Go there, get the Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"One of the best diners I've ever been too. Crazy generous portions, delicious quality food, giant selection and just all around awesome place. The staff is also wonderful, all the servers were delightful and helpful. You MUST get their homemade pumpkin bread and banana bread. And I LOVED their potatoes. One of the places in town."}
{"text":"I could talk about the Omelette House all day long. Seriously, if you live in Vegas and you haven't been here, you're missing out. I have introduced this hidden gem to a dozen people and it immediately becomes their favorite too. So before you go get a 'moon over my hammy' at that god awful chain restaurant, give this place a try. I promise you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. The zucchini was a group favorite. The service was less then okay. Our server keep forgetting stuff we ordered. I had to get up & get my own cup of coffee because they kept forgetting to get me one. Disappointing service but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Second time here and it didn't disappoint. I'm from CA and love this place that is away from the strip!  Had the rio grande omelet if I remember correctly. It had chorizo and avocados! I love that they have fresh baked banana bread or pumpkin bread. The spuds are also great! (Thin sliced potatoes)  This is an old fashioned mom and pop place with wood paneling on the walls and cute trinkets of roosters n such."}
{"text":"The omelette house as fantastic we had a very decadent breakfast including a lobster Benedict and stuffed french toast with cinnamon apple both were excellent I believe the chips are homemade and the service was great. This is a good place to go to get out of the casinos in have a good fresh breakfast"}
{"text":"I usually stay downtown when I'm in Vegas because it's not as crazy busy as being in the strip.  So of course, I was looking for a spot that was nowhere near the strip when heading out for breakfast.  Found this place and was immediately impressed with their food and portions!  Ordered an omelet, which came with potato chips and freshly baked bread (I chose banana).  Although I wish some of the chips were a bit crispier, I love potato in general so I just kept eating it up, with a side of ranch, of course.  The freshly baked banana bread though was so good!  They don't joke around with the portions of this place.  Needless to say, both the boyfriend and I had to take to-go boxes, and if you've ever seen my boyfriend, he's not usually the to-go box type of guy.  The servers are attentive and the owner is very friendly.  Make sure to make your way to this place before 11am though because anytime after that, you'll be sure to have a wait.  Oh and make sure to bring an appetite and an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Pumpkin bread is warm. Leave off butter.  HUGE portions. Great and attentive service.  Every waiter/waitress helps you, not just yours.   Spuds are not homefries northerners are used to.   Corned beef hash was actual chunks of meat and obviously not from a can!  (can't say the same about other places).  Mile high omelet was too big to eat and I am big guy!  Kitschy decor, but who cares with that when the food is good!  Packed for Thursday morning, but didn't have to wait.   If you have a car and you are near the strip, take the drive out. You won't be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"Whenever we drive beyond 95 freeway we always try to eat here. It's our favorite breakfast restaurant in this area. Food has always been good and the service is fast. Atmosphere is cozy. They offer a good selection of breakfast and lunch items."}
{"text":"A little hesitant at first just because of the area. Once I got inside the long line was seated quickly, within 5 minute (on a Sunday). The waitress Cathy was super friendly and the rest of the staff was courteous, helpful and fast. The food was excellent. (Everyone gets banana nut bread) I'm glad I came hear. Oh ya the price was more than half what I payed at the casino. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Our waitress,  Melia, was outstanding. She kept our coffee and water filled. My wife had the egg white omelet and I had the health nut. Huge and outstanding. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"So the surrounding neighborhood is nothing to write home about.  Reminds me of LA neighborhoods in the 80s.  But if you step into this restaurant, you instantly are in another place, and it feels comfortable.  Yeah, everything is kinda woodsy, but the food is where this place really shines.    We start off with coffee and water with our meals, or as our waiter calls it, \"a stiff coffee and a water chaser.\"  Hey, this place has personality too!  \"Waiter!  Another round !\"    Omelets are huge and very delicious.  The Californian omelet has avocado, sausage and jack cheese.  American comfort food at a good price!  The only drawback is that I miss the hash browns.  They have \"spuds\" which look basically like potato chips.    The chili is very good.  It has a little kick, but it was made for most people to enjoy, so it is not too hot.    Sandwiches  and burgers are also very good.  They come with spuds too.  Why can't they have french fries?  You can check them out on the web.  http://www.omelethouse.net/"}
{"text":"Love this place, food and service are always great. We love the banana nut bread and they give you a hood size of it. Prices are good I think and they are close to home. Just wish they were open for dinner, they close at 3pm."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to the Omelet house in probably 30 years so decided to try it out this morning. Staff was friendly and attentive but server was slow and unorganized. She may have been new, not sure. French toast was soggy. Toast didn't arrive till 10 minutes into our meal - apparently the first batch burned. Not a huge fan of their potato chips rather than traditional breakfast potatoes. However, my mushroom, spinach and cheese omelet was off the chart. Huge, hot and tasty. The ham and eggs my husband got were standard fare. If you go, get the omelet for sure."}
{"text":"Wow what a place...there is a lot of breakfast places but not like this one.  First it has a retro style to it.  The service is really great.  My motto is if you don't have to wait then...wait I don't have a saying, now normally when I hear the word omelet I thinking of a little fold over omelet with 3 small pieces of meat...but this place has one of the best omelet ever first the omelet is made with 6 eggs loaded with lots of meats...veggies...and cheese.  I like the fact that this place had different types of omelets...and their pancakes are amazing they melt right in your mouth.  They had these type of potatoes that were actually chips and they were good.  Overall I will come here again..."}
{"text":"Seriously good Corn beef hash was amazing. My new favorite breakfast house,"}
{"text":"I came here to get some breakfast and this place was just down the street from my house. I ordered the country fried chicken with eggs and a side of corn beef hash.  The waitress brought over the country fried steak which came with breakfast country potatoes your choice of toast and 2 eggs. The waitress got my order wrong but it was really good I didn't care. The eggs were supposed to be over medium but I got over easy. The toast was just overwhelming with butter that I couldn't eat anymore. The meat and country potatoes were the best things on the plate. I would come back to order something else but I would have to ensure I get my country fried chicken with gravy!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good breakfast spot! The omelettes are huge(you can definitely share) and you get a nice helping of potatoes too. I wish there had been a little more of the mix ins / filling of the omelette - seemed to be a whole lot of egg, but it was good none the less. Service was pretty good, food came out in a timely manner. I'll probably give it another whirl!"}
{"text":"As a valley resident since the early 70s, I appreciate the fact that the Omelet House family has been an established local favorite for a very long time. Since relocating to the southeast Henderson part of the valley 5 years ago, this has become my favorite location. It is a pretty good sign when the faces of the staff never change. They are well appreciated with good tips by regulars like myself and don't leave.   It is like my \"Cheers\" because I can go there alone and sit at the counter, or bring in a group and I am known. I always get quality service. I know that I am recognized as a regular, but I observe a consistency for everyone.  The food servings are always ample and quite reasonably priced. I love bringing guests with kids here because of the Balloon Lady making the rounds with entertaining balloon creations. A young man serves as doorman and greeter while selling the Sunday paper.   The staff is always friendly, courteous and accommodating even when they get slammed on Sunday mornings. Make sure to arrive before 8:30AM on Sundays if you don't want to wait for a table.   I enjoy the Omelet House and am so at home that I don't see any flaws. It was recently pointed out to me by a guest that the restaurant's carpeted floor is not a hygienic choice. I have to agree. I would much rather see a floor that is easier to keep clean in an eating establishment. Nonetheless, I will continue to patronize the Omelet House, but I have to only give it 4 stars because of the carpet."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Black Forest omelette was good & homemade chips are nice. Had the baby omelette which is 3 eggs. Walnuts on top of pumpkin bread nice addition. Waitress & hostess were fabulous"}
{"text":"As good as the food is and the solid derive, just be prepared to be accosted by an obese family every weekend peddling their newspapers."}
{"text":"This place is still the same after so many years... and that's a good thing.  I love that you can get half size omelets and the potatoes are wonderful, almost like homemade potato chips for breakfast!  We try and make it back at least once a month, the servers are so friendly!"}
{"text":"Food was great service was beautiful(Amenda ) Price was too low ,bread (pumpkin and banana ) Was AMAZING,the best breakfast in Las Vegas  1st time here ,found them on yelp."}
{"text":"Omelet House is the PERFECT place for a great breakfast at great prices.  They have a million different omelets and a wide variety of hearty breakfast selections to choose from.  They also have lunch selections like burgers and sandwiches that a really good as well.  If you want a fresh, hot and hearty breakfast, then this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Very run of the mill breakfast. Stale, cold French toast, runny omelets and bad coffee. What you would expect to get from a place like this. Service is nothing to write home about either. You'd be better off going to an iHop or a Denny's."}
{"text":"The main reason for 5 stars is the staff...we constantly were checked on, had different waitresses refilling coffee and water because they were getting their tables, it's not something you see that much anymore...the staff working as a team!  I'd come back solely because of that.  The amazing banana nut bread is the second reason!!!!"}
{"text":"Must visit place !! We went in for late breakfast and as expected there was a wait-in but not long. We were soon seated and our order wAs taken by the lovely waitress who was more than accommodating our request to split the gigantic 6 egg omelet for 2 people! The potato chips are to die for ! Banana bread was good but didn't live upto the hype"}
{"text":"Anyone who has lived in Vegas for a while will tell you to check this place out. Do give it a shot. Do not expect it to be your typical, modern Las Vegas restaurant.   The best words to describe Omelet House: cute, classic, comfy  The food is consistently OK, but the portions are HUGE and often unfinishable (new word). Breakfast comes with a \"chips\" option, which are delicious, fresh made slices potatoes... GET THOSE!!!  There service is good, but nothing too special. If you are there on a busy day, expect a missed item or long wait for follow ups.  Omelet House is a MUST TRY but not a MUST LOVE... you'll like it. it is good for certain days :)"}
{"text":"Omelet House rocks! Over 30 different and unique varieties on the menu, all with clever names, a gut-busting size, and crazy-low prices! Even the varieties with fancy fillings like asparagus and lobster are still around $11, and the sheer size makes them more than shareable!  THE SPARTACUS: Asparagus, mushrooms, and cheddar, with cheese sauce on the side. You wouldn't think to combine a classy veggie like asparagus with the white trash favorite condiment of nacho cheese, but it works! Even without a protein this packs a punch, if you can eat the whole thing, it'll fill you up all day! CHILI VERDE OMELET: pork, green chile sauce, and jack cheese. It's just slightly spicy, super meaty, and full of flavor. The green sauce is done well here, and you can add on various hot sauces at the table if you need extra heat. SIDES: Omelets come with a bread choice and \"Rip Taylor's favorite spuds\", which are house-made potato chips, and they're pretty decent. Good mix of soggy and crisp potato slices to pick out the kind you prefer, but I wish they were seasoned better. Of your bread options, the Pumpkin Nut Bread is off the chain. Get it.  Service was attentive throughout, the whole staff hustled to flip tables and help each other out. Interior is bigger than the exterior suggests, and it's decorated country-style with homey knick-knacks and antique furniture. Definitely coming back to this spot, gotta try their (current featured special) chicken fried steak omelet (with gravy inside!) on my next visit."}
{"text":"We were a party of seven, it takes a long to be seated but it doesn't matter...when we received our order we were impressed!!! Everything good and fresh, good service, good coffee, everything was perfect! Generous tasty portions and good prices! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had not been here for many and so glad we stopped in!  If they continue with the quality of service that we experienced, they will be open for another 39 years. I couldn't ask for better service. The omelettes are wonderful. I only wish they served another type of potatoes. The \"spuds\" (potato chips) don't work for me."}
{"text":"My husband I went there for the first time a couple of days ago and I ordered the sausage and cheese omelet ( I think it's the porky pig or something like that)) and my husband ordered the French toast. The French toast came with 2 eggs, done perfectly, and bacon. It was your standard french toast like you would make at home but it was delicious and like I said, the eggs were done perfectly. The omelet I ordered was stuffed with sausage and cheese. Delicious!!! It came with these thick cut \"potato chip\" type potatoes that I surprisingly really liked ( I'm a hash brown kinda girl). The BEST part of our meal though was our waitress Shirley!!! She was the sweetest, cutest lady ever!!! She said she's been there for 15 years and everyone knew her and would grab her to say hello. I'm gonna ask for her section every time I go from now on. Adorable!! She really made the place and made you overlook the old, dusty, fake plastic plant decor. Lol. So In summation, I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a really good omelet. If you're looking for gourmet, fancy breakfast dishes you won't find it here but they do have eggs Benedict too. The selection of omelets was vast. 2 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"This used to be a 5 star rating for me, it has changed to a 1 star. With the past 3 bad experiences, I can now say bye to the original omelet house.  My heart is broken... the owner of this place needs to calm down with employees and customers."}
{"text":"I have been stopping and enjoying the Omelette  House food since 2001. The food is consistently good and I count on it being the same. I nurture myself with the home cooked goodness. Yum!"}
{"text":"Review about this place were right, BIG portions! Off the strip but only about 10 minutes away from the end of the strip. We ordered the Corned Beef Hash breakfast, a pancake, and an omelette The Corned Beef Hash came with potato crisps, very flavorful and tasted just baked, not soggy at all. I ordered the banana bread instead of toast, was pretty tasty! The servers were nice and attentive, only when we paid was there a wait, but no biggie to me. Overall, food was good and the price just as good."}
{"text":"The Omelet House is pure calorie overload, and as you might suspect there is nothing gourmet about it.  However, knowing what you're going in for, it's good classic comfort (read: deep fried) food.    We started with the fried zucchini at the suggestion of the waitress, which came with ranch and orange \"cheese\" sauce, and was good in that it just tasted like fried dough (I'm not sure why they even bother to put zucchini inside!).  I had the scrambled eggs with wheat toast and potatoes - for those of you who don't like your toast pre-soaked with butter you must ask for it dry, and beware the potatoes are sliced like potato chips but are not crunchy... not really my thing, but my boyfriend loved them.  He got an omelet made-to-order with spinach and cheese and mushrooms and it was enormous, but he made a good dent in it.  :)    We also got the pumpkin bread and banana bread on the side and both were moist and tasty.  My better half said the coffee was surprisingly good, and we both found the service to be very friendly and quick.  Oh, and as far as location - if you're not a local, be prepared to pay about $20 for a cab from the strip to get here, which is pretty steep considering the bill for two people was around $30."}
{"text":"If your in Las Vegas you have to dine  here. They sat us right away. Staff was so friendly, their fresh warm pumpkin bread was to die for, and my omlette was delicious. They have over 40 omlettes to choose from, pancake & waffles specials as well. My kids and husband also loved it. Very clean restaurant. Will definitely be dining here when in town again. #ByeIHOP"}
{"text":"The food is fabulous.  I've enjoyed breakfast here as well as lunch and have eaten here several times; always great food and more than I can eat.  Food is fresh and not processed, heated and served.  My only complaint with this place is the service.  There are a couple of good waitresses, but for the most part I wasn't impressed with the wait staff."}
{"text":"I'm from Louisiana and this place felt like home. The service was is phenomenal. The waiters/waitresses made me feel like family and were very kind and generous. The food was outstanding and very filling. I definitely felt the ITIS hit me after eating. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who plans to visit Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The Lobster Benedict was what I ordered. With no regrets. The side option was thinly sliced chip-like potatoes. I dipped these in the hollandaise that smothered my benedict dish.   A nice selection of hot sauces:  Tabasco, Frank's, Cholula.  Coffee wasn't great.   The service is pretty on point. I have to say that I had forgotten who our server was because she was tag-teaming with at least 4 others.   So when boyfriend didn't get his side of pumpkin bread, I asked the next server that refilled our coffee about it. She scanned our table and told us she would be back with it right away.   I guess our original server saw her do this and ran over to our table. She asked the other server what she was bringing us. She told her that we hadn't gotten our bread. Original server asks me if she had brought the pumpkin bread out and I say \"no\". She then grabs our receipt from the table and says, pointing at me, \"She doesn't get bread with her dish\" to the other server. Other server says, \"Well, we forgot, so they get two now.\" Original server makes a huge deal and finally says \"ugh, okay. They can have both. This time.\"  So rude? So not what I was expecting? I'm more than aware that the English muffin from my benedict counts as my toast option, but when the server brought bread for both of us, I figured it was her way of making up for forgetting about us. Our original server made it seem like we were scamming them out of pumpkin bread. Did she get up early to bake it herself?  Boyfriend asked her for a to-go box for his unfinished bread. I made it a point to tell her that we only need it for the one piece, but she acted like she didn't hear me.   I'd definitely go back to Omelet House. I would say that I'd just avoid being sat in her section, but I honesty don't remember what she looked like!"}
{"text":"Love the pumpkin bread!!! My favorite omelette is the bugsy siegel. I also love the potatoes.. with a side of cheese sauce. Been coming here as long as I can remember with my mom and dad"}
{"text":"Very goo quality food here.  They have great breakfast and good lunch ietms.  The burger I ordered this last trip was very big, and really good too.  I like the breakfast dishes here especially.  They are slightly different than a lot of other places.  My only issue is I wish they had normal hashbrowns, but instead they server some other form of potatoes.  Overall though, good food and good service, and that is why you come here right."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, cost was very reasonable for the food and atmosphere is what I wish the rest of Vegas still emulated.  Great stop before your flight home..."}
{"text":"Great hangover food...more later.  OK. It's later..a Friday...and I have given up alcohol for Lent so I have time to add more.   Omelet House has 2-3 locations in Vegas but we went to this location, located near UNLV. We walk in and it looks like a Denny's. There are some booths, some tables and some bar seating. No drinks are served though...just coffee and food.  So we sit down and get our drinks, it feels like diner. Strong coffee that tastes like sh*t but it does the job, water is filled with a smile. But what do I want to order. There are literally over 100 things to order here. After about 10 minutes we all decided on what to order.  Chicken Fingers - 3 huge fingers, lightly breaded served with fries..a ton of them. Not anything special.  Turkey Club - Typical turkey club served with fries.   Lobster Omelet - Pretty damn good. It probably used about 3-4 eggs but there was at least 1/2 a pound of lobster and avocado along with cheese. The taste was awesome. Keep in mind that all omelet's come with hash browns and all omelets are HUGE.  Chicken Fried Steak - Mine. I love chicken fried steak, or as some call it Country Fried Steak. My obsession with this meal began in the Marine Corps and it continues till this day. So what is it? Let me tell......A chicken breast pounded flat, drenched in batter then fried. Served with 2 egss your style and hash browns, this was heaven to me.  Honestly one of the better ones I have had in my life.  Bottom line: I would come back again and again. This hits the spot for your Sunday afternoon hangover from Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is just plain awesome. The BEST Eggs Benedict in all of town, hands down. Really good breakfast potatoes, and obviously just endless omelet possibilities, and they are all delish. HIGHLY recommend this one."}
{"text":"I'm here right now and had and issue deciding either the Lobster Fest or the ever famous Corned Beef Hash... So I decided to go with the Corned Beef Hash and boy.... It was indeed one of the best I have ever tried, just the right crispness and the right serving size, the coffee is great!  I will definitely be back for the Lobster Fest Omelette...  Friendly staff and very nice homie feeling, which kept this hidden gem grounded...  I'm headed back to Vegas next week for work so I am definitely coming back for more..."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good...If you're in Vegas and want to eat a great breakfast try the Omelet House, it's about as good as it gets, staff is super friendly, and the food is amazing. I tried the Lobster Fest w/ banana bread and their addictive Potato Spuds and to be honest, with you, couldn't remember when I'd had a better omelet, I walked away stuffed and raving about my meal.  I consider a few things in Vegas \"must try,\" like Sammy's LA Pastrami & Burgers or the Oyster Bar in Palace Station, and without a doubt Omelet House has joined the list.  Considering how the good the food is here and the proximity to Downtown and the Strip, it's well worth a drive to have an amazing, reasonably priced breakfast."}
{"text":"Must must must try. Usually I go to the Peppermill in Vegas but I was in Henderson for my daughters soccer tourney. I found this gem and now..... I will make a trip here every time I come to town. It's worth going out of the way for. The Corned Beef Hash is a game changer!"}
{"text":"Actually I love eggs and everything made with eggs. But here I got less than expected.  THE SERVICE: It was truly disappointing. They were slow and unable to answer any basic questions. They never refilled our drinks. Staff just seemed to disappear for long periods of time.  THE FOOD: Well, actually I am a good eater and usually finish my entire plate but here I ate only half. It just wasn't that great. The omelet was OK, potatoes were very bad((( and my friend also agreed with me. Have to say that the portions are huge.  OVERALL: It was a bad experience. Won't return to eat here again..."}
{"text":"It's worth the wait in line on any weekend. Hands-down far superior to an IHOP or Denny's. Staff even for a busy day was on top of drinks and our tables order all came out correct. The food was excellent to the point there wasn't even leftovers. Super large portions but so good you'll eat it all"}
{"text":"Reading is fundamental. Wish I would've read the reviews clearly...closely, whatever. I don't like potato chips with my breakfast. Yes they were good, seasoned well, but can get soggy by sitting with on or next to your omelet. So I'd suggest a separate plate to preserve the crunchies!!"}
{"text":"Great place! My party and were served fast and the food was excellent. Ordered the Eggs Benedict, loved the holidaise sauce. The potatoes that came with the breakfast were soft, tasty, and seasoned to perfection. Coffee was great too, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I traveled with a group and notice this spot. We were welcomed and the hostess Dena was great. Since we were a bigger crowed we have a total of four servers and each one was pleasant and accommodating. The food is delicious, I recommend the lobster omelette and the coffee was great. This is the best diner I ever met. This cali girl will come back!"}
{"text":"Now this place does a omelet right! Well they better since it is the name of their business. The portions here are huge and you definitely get your money's worth here."}
{"text":"Substitute cheese for actual flavor, burnt & limp potatoes, portions huge, unable to split checks, locally run. I support cuz its not a chain."}
{"text":"There is a fine line between service and hospitality! This place define the real hospitality. Awesome! Server's smile are worth coming back.  Food are awesome! Delicious! Home cook style, not commercialized."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times and had all great experiences, until this last one. My coffee was never refilled for the entire meal (which is hard to do because there seems to be an abundance of people serving coffee). Also, while trying to get the biggest bang for our buck, the waiter couldn't tell us what was in the kitchen sink omelet (so we could take out things and split to. And then proceds to LOUDLY say that we must be on a very tight budget and that there are cheaper options on the menu we could have. That. Wasn't. The. Problem. There was no issue on money, just trying to get what we want while the being money conscious. I felt so embarrassed. I don't know if we will be back..."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, the only reason they are even getting a 2 star is the patty melt. Every time I have been there I have had the worse service, paid way too much, and was served subpar food. The last time my husband and I went we were served moldy bread and had to ask to see the manager and to actually have the bread brought BACK to the table after the server just walked away with the bread without a word. I would rather just go down the street a bit and go to the other omelet house."}
{"text":"Try the Bugsy Siegel omelet and the stuffed French toast."}
{"text":"Very good home sty;le breakfast.  We have been to other locations - always yummy.  Feels like a neighborhood diner."}
{"text":"Hands down!! Jennifer, the waitress is bomb!! The food, the omelet (can feed two) , pancakes, warm banana bread, toast, and coffee was definitely worth ubering here! Country to the max and WE love it! The host was also on point and very nice!   Jennifer is definitely someone you do not want to lose as part of your business!! great  job Omelet House! Mahalos from the 808!"}
{"text":"Great service!!  Omg the pumpkin bread was to die for and how about that homemade corn beef hash.  Me and the gf loved this place.  One thing to point out, the baby omelet isn't exactly baby-sized."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Good portions. The bread is great always refilling drinks without needing to ask."}
{"text":"Imagine a fabulous 6 egg omelet? Of course you can downsize to a 3 egg.  Every vegetable in my omelet had a fresh and distinct flavor, especially loved the sauteed mushrooms.  The place is decorated with a lot of history (Vegas and otherwise), we sat in a Mayor's booth.  The potatoes were chip style, I would have loved the option of country style.  Oh my!!!  The banana bread was incredible - our server was super friendly and knew that we couldn't possibly finish our fresh baked banana bread, so she offered to wrap it to go.  It was the perfect snack for our 5 hour drive home.  Thank you Omelet House - Best Breakfast in Las Vegas - We will continue to always visit when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit. Kind of a hidden treasure!! Joanne was awesome and Kendrick was very attentive. Food was great and there was no wait. Will come back!!"}
{"text":"Great service ! Server was very accommodating . Got the veggie omelet and I absolutely loved it . Had a great visit and I will be coming back for more stuffed french toast !"}
{"text":"I stopped by the Omelet House with a group of friends a few Sundays ago.  We were looking for a good recovery breakfast after burning the candle at both ends all weekend.    After looking over the dozens of omelet combos I settle on the Porky Pig, which comes stuffed with sausage and cheddar.  On the strong recommendation of one of the others in the group that has been coming in for years I went for some of the homemade pumpkin nut bread.  Great call, it was awesome!  Served before the other food comes out it's warm and ready to soak up some butter.  I have to say that I was not much of a fan of their potatoes, as they were more like brau chips than hash browns.  They were cold and fairly greasy, and seemed to me more like what you'd get as a side at lunch.   Besides omelets they have all the breakfast standards on the menu, as well as some tasty looking lunch options.  The service was fast and very friendly, and the environment was uber casual.  Toss in some great grub and it was just what the doctor ordered for me.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Speak-less this is a diferente Secret treasure From the moment we walked in .... call incredible service some of the best and Las Vegas oldschool The wait staff works like a team.   Thank you miguel , Laura, Kathy , Valerie is & Loni and all the Team   The Food super generous portions Our new home for breakfast"}
{"text":"Holy cow.  I was trying to find a great breakfast place that wasn't cookie cutter and just focused on making great food.    I hit the mother lode - this place was absolutely the right choice.  From the moment I walked in and was greeted by the hostess, to the time I ordered my meal from my waitress (Amanda, I think?) everything about this place oozed with customer service.    I had the lobster omelette and had pumpkin bread instead of toast.  The omelette was fluffy, loaded with lobster and avocado and had just the right amount of cheese in it.  Oh, and it also came with potatoes that were sort of like home made potato chips.  Cooked perfectly, not dripping with deep fat fryer residue.    I had to pace myself to enjoy every bite.  Service was attentive but not over the top.  My Waitress seemed to know exactly when to stop and refill my coffee or water.  This is THE place to have breakfast.  Now, sadly, others will know my secret.  Go to this place.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great food! Good price.  Our order was messed up, but it worked in our favor - we would have had too much food! If we received what we originally ordered.   Breakfast portions were very generous."}
{"text":"Service is awful. Waited over 25 minutes just to have our order taken. There were tables who were seated after us whose orders were taken before us. We were getting ready to walk out when the waitress finally came over. Never again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the location on Maryland Pkwy that closed down. There are a couple items that make me come back and that would be their 'Real' Corned Beef Hash, Fresh Potato Spuds (like Potato Chips) and their homemade Pumpkin Bread. And as the name says \"Omelet\", not only are they great, they are also portioned for heavy feasters!  Homemade Pumpkin Nut Bread: Very Delightful Treat, more like a Dessert for me!  Homemade Corned Beef Hash: \"Best you ever had\" - their description.. Eventhough it wasn't quite the Best I've ever had, it was close! Chunky, Prefered and Always makes me a Happy Camper!   Fresh Potato Spuds: are super thin twirl slices of potato and lightly fried. Some parts are crispy and some are a bit chewy.. Unique, Not Filling and Delicious!  I've tried a few of their Omelets that did not Disappoint!  \"The Cowboy Special\"- homemade chilie, cheese and onions \"Farmer Juan\" - bacon, onion, tomato and cheddar cheese \"38 Special - for all you meat lovers\" - ham, bacon, sausage, cheddar and jack cheese \"Chili Verde Omelet\" - pork, green chili sauce with jack cheese  I love the Chicken Ranch Decor and their Creative Menu Item Names and Descriptions! Servers always giddy and quick to serve and Prices are Reasonable!! HHHHMMMM.. Now I'm Feeling Breakfast,..Tonight!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The staff is amazing!! The owners are so kind!! The food is great!!! Large portions to keep you full!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Definitely the place to go to while in Vegas. Took a chance and looked on yelp for reviews, had great reviews and it was co-signed by the Lyft driver. It's definitely one of the great cheap eats diners you want to try."}
{"text":"I ordered the lox omelet which was delicious the only downfall was how massive my plate was that I couldn't come close to finishing it. The potato spuds were amazing and the pumpkin bread to die for My mom had the Greek omelet and she said it was really great"}
{"text":"Of course, we found this little place on YELP. The decor was very dated. Most of the clienteles were locals which is always a good sign. All we can say is this, they must put crack in their banana nut bread because it is simply amazing. Also, their coffee is very very good. They tell me that it is Farmers Brothers but I think it is a different grade. I could easily eat the banana nut bread along with 4-5 cups of coffee. That would be my definition of a good meal here. Oh yeah, the food is delicious, too."}
{"text":"We had the lobster omelet with chorizo on the side, the pilgrim sandwich, the banana bread, and a cup of strawberries.  Basically the food was ok.  The lobster omelet was huge, the pilgrim sandwich was decent.  The strawberries weren't that sweet.  The banana bread was very fresh, right out of the oven.  The service was very good and attentive."}
{"text":"Superb selection and great service. I only give 4 stars because we have only been there once and I want to leave room for improvement"}
{"text":"Very clean, great service, friendly staff and amazing food. The hot banana nut bread with butter super yummy. So glad we decided to get off the strip and try something different. All the Yelp reviews are spot on and would highly recommend anyone to try the Omelet house"}
{"text":"Huge omelets and great food. Mid range in price but the portions are enormous. Six egg omelette...nuff said. Service was awesome and just a great Vegas experience here. Will definitely be back when we're in town."}
{"text":"we started with great hot chocolate! Then ordered the Ranchero omelet and my son the porky pig. The banana nut bread is incredible and a serious size portion. The omelet s were also incredible. Highly recommended and will come again."}
{"text":"The omelets are HUGE!! If I'd known this I probably would have gotten the \"baby\" size which I'm sure is still gigantic. I had the popeye omelette which has spinach, mushrooms, jack cheese, and I added bacon. Then they give you the option of pumpkin bread or toast. I had the pumpkin bread which came out first, steaming hot with a side of butter. very good! Overall, this place is a fun breakfast spot to check out. Kinda hole-in-the-wall, country diner feel, but tasty! The only disappointment was weak coffee, and we'd been up since 6:30, so I needed it. I went with my boyfriend and his two little ones (2 and 4) and the service staff was very friendly to the kids and accommodating to their needs."}
{"text":"Fantastic neighborhood place. A \"Must Visit\" when you come to town. Pick the pumpkin bread over toast, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Huge amount of food. Regular omelette has 6 eggs, ask for baby size , it's 3 eggs. Really tasty. Great pumpkin bread"}
{"text":"Tried this place today for brunch and it was really good! They have huge omelettes and the server was nice enough to tell us they have big portions so we were able to share. It looks like a family owned business and everyone was very nice and friendly. We are deff coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast while attending the US Rugby 7's and it was a really nice surprise. The service is fast, the food is very fresh and you get a discount if you stayed at Sienna Suites.   The positions are huge and the potato chips are a nice surprise. Those are bomb! I would eat here again for sure if I am back in the area."}
{"text":"Pulling up in a lyft was a bit questionable due to the shopping center this restaurant is in, but I am so glad I went in. Service was fast and the Lobster Eggs Benedict was delicious. This place was also very reasonably priced! Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, but first yelp review on it. Has ways been a decent breakfast spot that I regularly visit whenever I'm in Sin City.  It's a good spot to start your day of hangover recovery.  Only negative so far is they don't take AmEx which when I'm out here on business sucks cuz  I have to use my own cash instead of the company card.  Not the end of the world, just extra hassle."}
{"text":"Your Omelets are HUGE! Fresh real eggs. Veggies bright and fresh. And the potatoes are like potatoe chip looking but made from real potatoes. Will I come back! A huge yes!!!!"}
{"text":"In town for business and needed a good hearty breakfast. The Omelet House did not disappoint. While the decor is stuck in the late 70's, the food and the service is spot on! I had the 38 Special Omelet Bacon, Ham, Sausage, Cheddar and jack Cheese. The eggs were fluffy and delicious plus you did not have to search for the meat...IT WAS everywhere. I am a big eater and the portions were HUGE.  Great potatoes too. They were almost like chips. Good Stuff."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite breakfast place. I never order omelettes at restaurants but this place has got them down. They are delicious plus they have a big selection of lunch items. You got to try their country fried steak omelette. You actually stay fool the entire day. My son has had the hamburger and he thinks it's delicious. This place is been around for a long time so it's older. The staff there are wonderful. We've gone to them over the years and they remember you. They are professional friendly and just lovely people. Get there early because it is a popular place."}
{"text":"How lame you can't do substitutions on omelets. A $10 omelet is now $13. Screw this crappy place, I won't be back!"}
{"text":"This breakfast spot is one of the oldest and the BEST in this town. Homemade down home cooking. Flavor never disappoints. The service is always welcoming, efficient and everyone seems to work as a team! The corned beef hash is amazing and the potato spuds are delicious. They have flavored creamer upon request (thank goodness) and opt for the pumpkin bread, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I think the locals have spoken. This is a good place too eat. The layout of the restaurant is awkward (since we walked through a dining room then past the kitchen to the back dining room). Along the way it's decorated with random old collectibles. Interesting.  So we had the Homemade Corned Beef Hash and the Lobster Eggs Benedict. Both were really good. Thank you quick tips. Portions are huge! Also the pumpkin bread was awesome. Get it!  Originally came in there with a GROUPON Now deal only to find out that it was for their OTHER location. SAD FACE. Oh well.. still worth it.  My ONLY issue was there was black stuff in my water. Gross. 3.5 stars from me."}
{"text":"I am a native (born and raised) in Vegas.  I've been coming here for years! My husband is also a native, he has been coming here (this is the original location) for 40+ years!  We have tried lots of breakfast & brunch places, but this one tops them all.  Best prices for large meals, great service and good coffee too.      We LOVE the homemade fried zucchini, long strips dipped in a light batter that will have you craving them always (we have them as a breakfast appetizer with ranch instead of cheese)...      I have tried a lot of different dishes, (I often order the awesome Lobster Eggs Benedict) and every thing has consistently been great... I look forward to the choice of bread and their homemade potato chips on the side as well... yummy!      The kitschy feel of the place, and comfortable decor reminds me of a cottage with old Vegas entertainers signed pictures on the wall by the door.  The menu even has a sense of humor; see the \"Flatlander's Special\" Omelet.       I always take out of town guest here and they always want to go on their next visit as well.  The Omelet House is a Vegas original, and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast if you are in the area.  The portions are big. The food tastes ok. The service is fine, but I simply would not go out of my way to eat here.   We tried the waffles, chorizo omelet, farmer Juan omelet and the corned beef hash. There was nothing special about any of it. We did, however, enjoy the banana nut bread, pumpkin bread and the fried zucchini. Definitely give those a try. So, if you happen to be driving by and suddenly have a craving for mediocre omelets and a great banana loaf, by all means, stop by for breakfast...if the wait isn't long."}
{"text":"A fantastic place to have breakfast.  You are greeted with a warm and friendly hello.  The food is outstanding.  It doesn't matter if we sit at a table or the counter, everyone is kind, the food is perfect and the price is very reasonable.  One of my local favorites."}
{"text":"Before leaving my hotel today I was looking for breakfast on Yelp! I was tired of hotel food and wanted to find a locals type spot. I came across this place and noticed there 4.5 star average with 760 reviews. I thought how can that be? It must be good and I'll half to go check for myself to see if this could be true.  Yep!! Lived up to the reviews, very nice staff and food that seems like it's made in my own kitchen.  This will be my spot from now on the day I leave Vegas for home.  Jose was our waiter the whole time and was very friendly and attended to our every need. He also fixed us up with a to go cup of our drinks which I find very thoughtful.  I will spread the word to my Vegas friends."}
{"text":"Ordered the Farmer Juan felt like it was made out of 6 eggs so large attempted to make a dent! Their potatoes were pretty good though I thought it came with some sort of house sauce but it didn't. Had a side order of one blueberry pancake and that was ok a bit chewy-ish wasn't fluffy as I've had before elsewhere. I was turned off by the syrup it had a dried film on the top layer??? Had to keep tipping it until it broke through was disturbing but I was hungry so I let it go...but reason for one less star."}
{"text":"Oh my stars. Fast seating... fast service. Friendly and the most important part= delicious!!!  Had the corned beef hash and eggs and we'll be back when we're in Vegas again. For sure!  Hubby had French toast, eggs and bacon and he loved his food too. Portions were a good size."}
{"text":"This place was really good.  Huge portions of comfort food.  Good service.  The decor is totally old school, but the food and service helps to overlook that."}
{"text":"THE OMELETTE HOUSE IS BEST FAMILY RESTAURANT                     IN LAS VEGAS , HENDERSON   !!!! Thr owners Jeff , his wife and their staff are very friendly and and they always have smile and they are sweet and so good with my grandkids and if my grandchild is old enough to  talk the waitress or any staff members  will ask them what they want to eat then look at grandma or grandpa or parents to make sure that good. They make hudge portions I mean all their meals are hudge and everything  homemade to perfection the prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is the feeling of home that why my hubby will actually come eat here the feeling of home and the home cooked meals and they offer banana bread and pumkin bread with breakfast meals  this is why this is  our family's favorite place to eat and why we bring our family and friends from out of town when ever they come out to visit. This Omelette House is absolutely the best one all around the food make feel like ur home and the staff makes feel like family they are on top everything like when it comes to clean restrooms , clearing the table , to the waitresses taking an order , feeling refills and the owners always try to make sure their customers are always happy and they definitelyly don't want u to leave hungry and the portions are all so big u will always be taking a doggie bag home.   God Bless U At The Omelette House                          And Mrry Chrstmas &  Hppy Nw Yer"}
{"text":"Great hidden breakfast place near downtown Las Vegas (old Vegas). Lots of food for your dollar and real mom and pop feel. Doesn't feel like casino buffet breakfast and it is much cheaper than any restaurant in the casino areas. The reviews are correct on this one so stop by."}
{"text":"We LOVED the Omelet House!!! We can't pay the prices of meals on the Strip, so heard of the Omelet House and had our two breakfasts here. Prices are amazing - the average 2 eggs, bacon, potatoes, bread of choice was like $5.95. Yes! And their potatoes are homecooked and crispy - almost like potato chips. Their bacon is done just right, crispy and lots of it.  All their plates of food are large and with the breakfast comes a choice of banana or pumpkin bread. The place is large, with room after room filled with locals. Both times we went there during the week the place was packed. We'd be here weekly if we lived in Vegas. Which, thank god, we do not."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for breakfast. Huge portions, fast service and great prices. Was so good we went three days in a row. The pumpkin bread is so good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been eating here ever since we moved to Vegas, which was 6 years ago, and why I never wrote a review,  I don't know.  We love this place, because the prices are good, the food is great, and the service is wonderful.  We went in today for brunch, had a lovely server named Shannon,  who was the best server I've ever had since being in Vegas, and once again, due to their beyond huge portions, I wasn't able to finish my whole meal. LOL  I highly recommend Omelette House, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for breakfast. The omelets are one of the best ones I've had. They are huge so you better be hungry. We never really have to wait to be seated. The wait staff is always nice and on point with the refills. I will say don't expect your normal hash browns here they give you crispy chips. They are good but wasn't expecting that. Overall experience is good I come back again."}
{"text":"First time at this location and husbands first time in general. The service was great, speedy and attentive. Food was delivered fast, hot and delicious. Will be going back again. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food (large portions), service was excellent. Banana bread is a must, delicious. Davynn our waitress and Loni were awesome. We will come back next time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Food here is amazingly delicious... it's definitely a local spot huge omelette almost the size of the plate and it's paired with thin crispy fried potatoes... but to start off with first I got a slice of the pumpkin but bread it was nice and hot with a side of whipped butter! I will definitely be back and will make this on my list of MUST eats in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I loved going into a restaraunt and being greeted with a \"hi honey\"!  The service was excellent and the food was down right home cooking!  Hearty food that mom always made!"}
{"text":"Great place to go.  Good food.  Plenty of food.  Awesome atmosphere.  Check it out.  Local joint and worth the visit"}
{"text":"Must stop breakfast place if I'm in Vegas for a girl's trip! No need for any casino buffet, because this place has it all! Those potatoes are THE hangover cure! Something about the pancakes just warms the soul. This is definitely a local's treasure, thanks yelp for showing me this gem!"}
{"text":"I'm just not a huge fan. My table top was dirty upon being seated, and altho the hostess saw me wiping it-she didn't apologize nor take over cleaning it.  Food was just a notch above cocos or IHOP. I ordered the Benedict florentine. Way too much spinach. Very thick hollandaise, but not very tasty. Service was nice but no trophy. Guess this place is just a bit too cheapy trucker for me."}
{"text":"Went to try the omelette house for the first time as we were recommended this place by a friend. The decor is old fashioned and looked like your grandmas house. The menu had a quite extensive array of omelettes ( duh why would it be called the omelette house) but also offered sandwiches, pancakes, waffles, burgers, and more. These omelettes are really big so I would suggest you guys just order one and get it split (cost 95 cents) and they just added more potatoes (kind of a hybrid of a potato home fries and a chip). For the whole family we got the chicken fried steak, the famous fried zucchini half order, and the chili verde omelette. The omelette was almost like a chicken enchilada but replace the tortilla with eggs. It was good, filling, but couldn't eat to much of it. Seemed like they used half a dozen eggs to make the darn thing. Chicken fried steak was also good and again portions are so big you can share between two people unless you eat a whole lot. Kids got the waffles and hit chocolate and that was too much for two kids The zucchini was ok as I prefer large pieces of zucchini and they made theirs like zucchini fries. Never had it with cheese dip but was good. Service was great and overall would seem like a 4 Star deal but I just couldn't do it. Omelette lovers this would be the place for you!  Sorry almost forgot and had to come edit it but the banana bread was probably he best part of the meal as it was warm and tasted pretty good. Didn't much like the pumpkin...but I'm kinda biased too about banana bread because I am still floored by the ones I have had in Maui, HI and really haven't had any better"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for the weekend and decided to go to this place based on reviews and we did not want to go to IHOP as it gets old sometimes. we were a party of 7 adults with 3 children, we go seated right away which is always great when you have a large party. we got the menu and the first thing we noticed is that the kids menu was for children under 10 years old. with two 11 year old that was disappointing. so we were forced to order from the regular menu and mind you that if you decide to share a plate, there was an additional charge of $.90. which is the first i have heard of for breakfast. the second thing we noticed was how expensive this place is, and I'm from the San Diego area where there is pricey food. i was shocked to see that every omelet was between $9 to $10 dollar range which did not include a side of pancakes (maybe IHOP wasn't too bad). when we got our food it was plenty, but maybe not as much when you decide to share an omelet. My son ordered ordered short-stack of pancakes which only contained two pancakes..go figure, everywhere else a short-stack is usually 3 pancakes. My son will eat just about any kind of pancakes as long as there is enough syrup pour on them. Well, let me tell you, when my kid turns down pancakes, there is something wrong with them. i had a taste and they tasted like someone took a McDonald's pancake and put it in the microwave too long, after a while they were stiff as a board. The banana bread was Very tasty but the food in my opinion was nothing special and certainly not worth the $114 we spent at this place for breakfast. I could tell no one else was too impressed with the food as they had some left over and no one wanted  take the leftovers with them.  I was not a fan of having potato chips served with breakfast, with no options of having anything else. one last thing, if you want to order a \"baby size\" which basically is half the size of a regular omelet....you save a whole $.98 cents.....what a ripoff.  sorry Omelet House you are too pricey and food was not all that great...maybe i have high expectations for $10 omelets."}
{"text":"Amazing warm banana nut bread and delicious potatoes! The omelettes are huge...consider sharing. Coffee is not the best but everything else makes up for it. Friendly service and cozy place....the restaurant is inside a shopping center not to be confused by the sign."}
{"text":"Love this place. We try to come here or Hash House when we visit LV. We decided on the Omelet House this trip and it was great. They offer delicious pumpkin or banana bread with their entrees (A MUST), along with the usual toast or English muffin options. They have a huge choice list for omelets, and the standard breakfast fare. My wife and I shared a spinach, broccoli and Bacon omelet with cheese and the server split it onto separate plates as well as the banana bread. There is a 99 cent charge for the split, but they plate it like two smaller entrees. I received my own breakfast potatoes, that are served like tender chips - Delicioso. Also, I hate to say it, but their banana bread is better than my mom's."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and it lived up to its ratings. Great place. Get the smaller sized omelet unless you eat like a monster. You MUST have the freshly baked pumpkin nut bread. Request extra butter and be prepared for a party in your belly."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, the service is good. The prices are a little pricey but the portions are large. I would recommend."}
{"text":"The food portions are generous!  The service is exceptional.  The quality and price is great!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Had the omelets been a little less greasy, I would have given them five stars. The food was seriously delicious, and the service was super friendly! Plus, it's only a few minutes away from the strip. With everything on the strip being so expensive, especially the food and buffets, finding this place was definitely a nice alternative. Like I said, all the food is great, so the only suggestion I have is to \"baby-size\" your food because the portions are huge. They use around 6 eggs to make a normal meal. That's a pretty unhealthy dose of cholesterol in my opinion."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service, hot tasty and plentiful food. Coffee is in need of help. I have had church coffee better than their coffee."}
{"text":"Good eats. Great taters. Order the small omelet, and I bet you still can't finish it. Really good huevos rancheros and corned beef hash. Pumpkin vs banana bread?  You can't go wrong. Uber busy on the weekends, so go for a later breakfast. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We ordered the corn beed hash, and chili verde omelet. The portions are huge, but both were delicious. Their homemade banana bread was also super tasty! Plus, our waitress was the best. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Awesome place for school omelet! Huge ass portion! Regular size omelet is made out of 6 to 8 eggs! Ask for the mini version!!!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for yelp to help find little spots like this. Was amazed at how the reviews were for a dollar, and after my first breakfast here I'd have to agree.   The best part is the price, everything is less than 10 bucks but tastes great. My friend got the meat lovers omelette with a delicious side of potatoes that I've never seen prepared like that and I had the stuffed Apple French toast. Also great.  If you're feeling guilty for spending 70 dollars at a Vegas dinner last night and want to balance it out with a fair priced breakfast Omelette House will not disappoint"}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful.   The exterior sign in the front is a little deceiving, we almost left because we thought the building in the front of the shopping center was the Omelette House, and im so glad we found this little gem..  It was pretty busy for 10am on a friday, but we were seated immediately and asked what we wanted to drink as I was seating down. \"Great!\". I went to the restroom and its a little dated and dark but still clean. I cane back to the table and drinks were already here.   My boyfriend got the lobster omelette and I ordered the lobster benedict. The Benedict came with bread; the server gave me three options: pumpkin, banana and regular toast. I chose pumpkin and OHHHMGG, VERY SOLID CHOICE. It was so hot and you need to use the butter on it.   The food came out shortly after, very very quick food. And the Benedict was to die for because \"that is the best benedict ive ever had!\" Me and my boyfriend split food whenever we go out, I didnt even get to taste my boyfriends omelette because I was too full after the bread and my half of the Benedict. They do charge for plate splitting though so make sure you just split it yourselves. Our server was nice and told us beforehand.   They even checked my id for my credit card but they dont take discover or american express.   Overall, win. Im so glad we came here."}
{"text":"My coworkers love this place. So I've come to love it as well! I work with a lot of locals and they really know the hidden gems in this town.   I've been 3 times now. Each visit, the service has been spectacular. Friendly, and tenacious. They take your order quickly and keep your beverages topped off.   Most importantly, the food is really good. I have gotten the waffle and pancakes. I have also tried the homemade chips that they make. The muffins they serve look amazing but I have not tried one yet.   You won't leave here feeling like you've had the most amazing dish in your life but you'll certainly have enjoyed your experience here.   The decor isn't fancy but the place has a great, locals feel to it that makes it feel like an extension of your own dining table at home.   Definitely give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize that this was the same as the Omelet House located on Charleston. A pleasant surprise that I have such a good place close to my house. I took my parents here on a Friday morning and insisted that they try the homemade banana nut bread. They thoroughly enjoyed. I went with the pancakes and they were tasty.  The prices are good, the service was solid. There was very little crowd in there on a Friday morning which was also nice.   My mom went with one of the omelet options and said it was one of the best she's had in Vegas. My dad got French Toast, egg and bacon and he also thoroughly enjoyed.  Overall, definitely recommend as a solid local breakfast option."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for breakfast off the strip.  It doesn't have much appeal, but it makes up for it with the food.  The Omelet House has the best banana nut bread hands down.  The omlets and other breakfast items are good, but you definitely need to eat here for the banana nut bread."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast.  Large portions of well cooked, tasty food.  We went there one morning when we had an appointment downtown and hadn't eaten.  We informed our waitress that we were in a time crunch and she cheerfully made sure we got out of there in time for our appointment.  It's a little hidden away but well worth the search."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Well worth the wait, ( we only waited 10 minutes for a table). The omletes were HUGE and tasted fantastic!  Our waite staff were awesome! We WILL be back :-)"}
{"text":"This home style joint has excellent food and even better staff! Our coffee was kept full and so was our stomach.We will be dropping by every time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  I loved this place.  Locals seem to be flocking here.  The parking wasn't the best as it was a crowded shopping center.  The food was outstanding for breakfast.  From start to finish the service was great.  The waitress was super friendly and attentive.  The food was fresh and hot.  The -.5 would be for the restroom being kind of dirty.    I've heard you can tell a lot about a restuarant on how clean the restrooms are.  If they are messy chances are the kitchen is messy and dirty as well. Here the restroom was a bit dirty, but nothing too much to complain about.  After I'm giving them 4.5 stars.  If you are staying downtown and want a good breakfast, get in a car or cab and check this place out.  Better than any breakfast on Fremont street."}
{"text":"OLD SCHOOL!  Every time I step into the omelette house I feel as though I am going back to a different time.   The food is delicious and there are massive portions. I especially like the lobster Benedict it is amazing although I can only eat about one third of a meal no matter which one I order.   The servers are all very nice & share a certain casual vibe.    The cowboy is really tasty.  The Mexican on letters & dishes are all yummy.   Enjoy a warm slice of banana bread or pumpkin bread.   You will leave feeling stuffed if you are not careful.   Taking home a doggy bag is typical for us when we go here!"}
{"text":"As a LV resident for 10 years I have been to this location easily a dozen times since living here. My wife's preference is huevos rancheros as their version surpasses any other we've tried in the city. Their breakfast crowd on weekends is usually full but they're efficient in moving the clients along. Once upon a time I said I would continue dining here until I tried each of their omelettes. Not there yet but I have a goal. Service has always been excellent, with coffee replinished with a regularity that I wish other places would learn. Highly recommended for locals and visitors, so long as it's not overwhelmed for us regulars."}
{"text":"My god, the omelets here are the size of a Nerf football cut in half lengthwise. No wonder other reviewers split them among two people. There's 30 or so types to choose from; I had a guacamole, tomato and cheese omelet. You don't get hash browns, you get what appear to be thickly cut potato chips. They're pretty good. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the back of an older strip mall so no photos necessary.  If your looking for great omelettes and service, this is the place to go.  Lots of omelette choices so there is something for everyone!  I love the potatoe chips that come with the omelettes!"}
{"text":"I liked  the variety of omelets,  the one I tried was the lobster I loved it..i will go time and again.  I'm from Pomona California."}
{"text":"A charming breakfast restaurant.    We stopped here before leaving for home. We found this through a gluten free app and we were surprised at how yummy the Omelet House really is. I had the lobster benedict and it was AMAZING.  It came with what looked like chips, but they were thicker and more like fries.  I would definitely come back to this family owned restaurant. It was interesting to see all the family memorabilia on the wall.  I'm coming back when we're in town!"}
{"text":"Great food. Hearty omelettes my husband loved. I had the pancakes. They were good hard to go wrong with pancakes. Bacon was hard and didn't like. Decor needs major updating. The fake plants probably just house so much dust and grease."}
{"text":"Love this place! Extensive menu with lots of options plus they serve the best banana bread everrrr. Whenever I'm in Henderson I make sure to eat breakfast here"}
{"text":"Good food! Excellent portion sizes and overall good taste. Ordered sausage and cheese, hubby got chorizo, definitely hit the spot. Their banana bread is so good too!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"In Vegas wanted to try something new. Once again I have found another great place by using my Yelp app! Don't judge this restaurant by its location appearance or its decor.  The have a UNIQUE menu with a plethora of choices. There is something for everyone!  The food is EXCELLENT, the service is FANTASTIC and if you leave there hungry that is entirely your problem, portions sizes are HUGE!  We will definitely be back again, and will send friends too!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  Not the most amazing experience I've ever had but still something I would go back for.  Very old fashioned feel from the waitresses to the food experiences.  There were sometimes long waits between visits from the waitress.  This wasn't her fault - it's whatever this restaurant's process is: because it was clear she was hustling.  My omelette was pretty good but I think the place focuses more on giant food portions than food quality.  There were spots that were soft and undercooked in a way that was unpleasant but it didn't make it inedible.  The interesting potato side, pumpkin bread, and bacon were delicious though.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"Was able to get seated right away. Huge portions! I got the eggs Benedict and the spuds on the side over took my plate! My mother in law got the kitchen sink omelet and barely finished half. Plenty of left overs to take home. Nice pit stop on our way home"}
{"text":"After a stay at Valley Hospital, I was brought food ordered from Omelete House. I could go on and on about the zucchini and chicken noodle soup, they were fantastic. I was told everyone was pleasant and took pride in their restaurant, so I will likely make the trek back to check this place out for myself."}
{"text":"8 am in Vegas - we wanted breakfast. This spot is your usual country style breakfast joint... I would say like Denny's/Ihop with more offerings (especially omelettes) and cuter country like personality. I got the french toast breakfast which came with eggs, sausage (you can choose bacon if you prefer), and hash browns. The breakfast was pretty standard. Prices are standard as well, and service was friendly. It's a pretty big restaurant but it wasn't too busy during the time we went - I assume it gets busier on the weekends."}
{"text":"All in all a good place to share a ginormous omelet with someone. Their omelets are HUGE, so you can, for a small 'sharing' charge, split one with somebody and be quite well fed.  Their service is quick and friendly. The decor is ... just ignore it. The prices are reasonable and the food tastes pretty good. You should be satisified.  Don't tax their culinary skills though. I'd recommend sticking to the simpler breakfast type items."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Breakfast restaurant  ! I don't \"Mess with Success \" ,when it comes to my menu selection. The # 26 ( Spinach-mushroom-cheese ),cooked \"soft \",with a side of hollandaise.  The staff will insure you are very satisfied, and everyone involved ( bus/wait staff ) as well as the Owner ,goes \" The Distance \" to create a memorable dining experience  !  I always bring home extra Pumpkin Bread ,( a specialty) for those not able to dine-in . A mainstay ,in Las Vegas ,for many years .Skip the Strip , ( high food prices/ pay to park ) and make this your  \" Go To \" place. As a Strip Hotel Employee, I ,instead, recommend The Omelet House ,to our guests, looking for a better place for Breakfast /Lunch ."}
{"text":"We uploaded some photos of the omelets - they really speak for themselves.  You start with a slab of banana loaf (which should be called a cake) and then wash it down with your 6-egg omelet served with a side of really nice potato chips.  When you're sick of downtown Vegas, wake up a bit early, grab a rental car and drive out to the Hoover Dam and stop off here for breakfast; it's just the tonic for a Vegas night."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast spot in all of Las Vegas ever since it opened in 1978 the best of everything staff food parking atmosphere and the owners Kevin, Mike and Priscilla the best as well"}
{"text":"Me and my cousin went here for lunch today and when we were ordering the waitress (short, thin with short black hair blue shirt) seemed annoyed at our order but was still acting friendly. we order 2 omelettes as well as one omelette to go we also ordered a side of bisquits and gravy to share as i have had them before and they were amazing. I tasted the bisquit and gravy and it had a strong menthol flavor so i had my cousin taste it also we both agreed that there was something wrong with them so decided we didn't want it. We told the waitress what was wrong at that we didn't want it and she asked if we wanted something else while looking annoyed. We said no and that we just didn't want it. When we were about to go pay we saw the waitress up talking to the cashier, thinking she was telling her not to charge us for a order of bisquits and gravy we didnt want. we went up to the front and gave the cashier our check and asked her if we could get the bisquits and gravy taken off. She replied that our waitress said we had eaten half of them. We were appalled considering it had been a large order and 2 small bites had barely made a dent. We said you should go look at it and see then you will know how much we ate. The lady smirked and replied i don't know where they are now i said well i didn' eat it...she took it off all the while acting as if we were liars.  What happened to customer service or the customer is always right? I guess people just go there for the food and not the bad service.. I know last time i was blown away by the service and the food but it's been a while and standards must have dropped. I am a General Manager of a fast food chain and i would never employ people who acted this way.   Anyways we were here today Sunday the 10th at 120-220 pm. Normally i would give a large tip but because of that i didn't give her one."}
{"text":"Pretty solid American breakfast foods.  I was impressed by the attitudes of the workers, who all seemed pretty happy to be there and were enthusiastic when talking about the food. The clientele at the time was largely the grey-haired set which meant that our meal went smoothly, devoid of any obnoxious drunken silliness from other patrons. The environment reminded me a bit of Florida.  We ordered a few things;  * Cup of navy bean soup: Thick and hearty with ample chunks of navy beans and ham throughout. Not the most amazing or flavorful soup, but a satisfying bean soup. * Pumpkin Nut Bread: Woo-hoo, this stuff is GOOD! Warm pumpkin flavor with a molasses undertone and crunchy nuts with spices, this is more like banana bread than wonderbread. It's especially good warm with butter. * Biscuit with gravy: Thick, creamy sausage gravy smothering a biscuit that's been cut in half. A bit salty but overall good. * Lobster, Avocado & Cheese Omelet: This thing was a beast. HUGE omelet! The eggs are light and fluffy, supposedly cracked fresh on site. The lobster was tender, well complimented by the avocado with a decent amount in a $10 omelet. I didn't particularly like the stringy cheese with it as it seemed an incongruous flavor pairing, but the omelet was overall very satisfying with enough for 3-4 servings. It wasn't bad reheated the next day! It was served with crispy little potato rounds seasoned with herbs, salt & pepper. They're a nice change of pace from the standard hash browns but not necessarily what I'd consider a breakfast food. They, too, were good reheated the next day after being crisped in the oven. * Chicken Fingers: Interesting coating, different from the standard with a nice crisp bite. The meat itself was a little dry and the pieces were small. They come with ranch or cheese sauce and I believe more of the potato rounds. * Side of Bacon: SUPER crispy. I like bacon with some gristle left over for me to gnaw on so I didn't have any. J did and wasn't particularly into it. * Side of sausage: Instead of links these were patties, which we hadn't anticipated so we sent them back.  Their coffee wasn't astounding, but it was strong which was exactly what I needed. The mug it came in was awesome, too, very wabi-sabi baby!  We'll probably come back over the next few months. This place is a step above your average Denny's or IHOP, the staff all seemed pretty happy and the food was good.   Fun Fact: I don't know what a Grunion is, but make sure you take a peek at their \"Flatlander's Special\" . Takes a brave soul to order that, I assure you. ;)"}
{"text":"Love the food and the service here. It is so good! THe banana nut bread is to die for! It doesn't have the best menu for children but we manage. It's a little expensive. But we get big portions and great service!!!"}
{"text":"My fellow yelpers were not wrong on this one, and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast here last Sunday.  First, you have to know that we were staying at the Golden Nugget, and we needed to get out of the constant thump, thump, thump that has become the staple of the casinos.  We needed calm, we needed organized, we needed the feeling of home, and boy did this place deliver.  Your town probably has one of these places.  It offers everything, but, as this was our first visit, we only got to try two things.  My wife had an egg white veggie omelet that arrived with a side of potato chips.  The chips had been freshly cut, cooked and seasoned.  She ate a few and I ate a few.  It was all good.  Her dish also came with pumpkin break, which she enjoyed.  I had the pancake, egg, and bacon breakfast.  It was good.  So, if you're downtown at one of the casinos, need some space, some calm, some 'down-home', this is a great option, and it's only about five minutes away."}
{"text":"At first glance, I didn't know what to expect.  The exterior/ interior was kind of old-school, and kinda compact.  But me, my boyfriend, and his mother decided to give this place a chance. I was hesitant because diners / cafes in Las Vegas are a 50/50 to me.   The service was fast, and we were sat right away. Our server was on top of her game and she could tell by the look of our faces that we were newbies in this establishment She gave us time to look, and was ready to take our orders.   Me, knowing the food and beverage industry - I could tell our server was busy, but still managed to hit our table. Also, I could see the manager was trying to hit every table as well. I wish I could remember our server's name, she was pretty awesome, pretty, blonde, and on top of her game. She definitely received more than 20% from me.   Now to the food part, my boyfriend ordered a side of banana nut bread - and let me tell you, it came out fresh, warm, and tasted home made! The portion sizes of the breakfast were good. I ordered the waffle special, and the waffle tasted good even without syrup. My boyfriend ordered the corn beef hash breakfast and I was surprised to see potato like chips. The chips were different sizes, some thick and moist, others were crunchy. I kept grabbing at his plate for it. I have never been to a cafe that served this. His mom ordered stuffed french toast, and she was happy with it.  I'd like to come back, hopefully I will have the same great service. :-)"}
{"text":"We were in Henderson for my sons baseball tournament, and decided to try this place out for breakfast.  So glad we did! Great service and awesome food! Their potatoes are delicious"}
{"text":"I ordered the baby omelette and it was still overwhelming. The omelette came with homemade chips and a piece of banana bread. The omelette was tasty, just too big. The banana bread was delicious. After I had two bites of the bread, I gave up on the omelette and focused my efforts of the delicious bread."}
{"text":"the food is great, freshly made and made to perfection and to my exact order. the service is phenomenal. everyone is always so nice and helpful, it really made for a great experience. It's definitely a must to go to whenever I am in Vegas to visit friends. it has become a tradition for us."}
{"text":"Delicious comfort food. Portions are huge so come prepared in stretchy pants and an empty belly. D√©cor and building make you feel like you stepped back in time. The staff is super hospitable. I wish there was one closer to me in the green valley area."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times before. The food is yummy, the portions are very generous and the price is reasonable.We love the pumpkin and banana bread that comes with most breakfasts. The service is also good. The restaurant itself could use an update/face lift but I'm sure that's what keeps the prices reasonable."}
{"text":"What can you say about 39 omelette selections? How about a Peter Griffin FREAKIN' SWEET!!  I had the Porky Pig with sausage, cheese, and a side of cheese sauce and it was out of this farm! I wont even go into the banana bread, but if you don't order that you're the equivalent of snake eyes on the craps table. Ok fine, the banana bread MELTED in every bite and it's the best I've had (sorry Mom)..I'm glad she isn't a Yelper!  This is off the strip and I'm quickly learning the local cuisine blows circles around the main stream strip food..Be afraid corporate america because the roof to this house is on FIYAA!!"}
{"text":"Awesome banana nut bread. Huge, delicious 6-egg omelets. Friendly, quick service. A+!!!!   There was a huge wait (it was a Saturday morning), but we managed to get two seats at the \"bar\" in 20 minutes, cutting our predicted 30-40 minute wait time, and everyone was incredibly upbeat, helpful, and attentive. And the omelets were AWESOME!"}
{"text":"This place iS always great!  Good staff delicious food. Never disappoints.  And if you have a man that's an eater take him here!!! Great prices too."}
{"text":"Excellent service....Excellent food!!  Truly a hidden gem!  A little sketchy looking from the outside, but you won't be  disappointed.  First of all, a big thank you to our waitress Megan.  She was awesome!  Fast friendly service and a great sense of humor.  Look no further if you want a great breakfast experience.  Breakfast entrees can easily serve 2-3 people.  There is a surcharge of 95 cents if you split an entree.  Our group ordered the following entrees.    Kitchen Sink Corn Beef Hash Chile Verde Omelette Stuffed French Toast with Apple compote Meat Lovers Omelette  All were yummy....but my favorites were the  Kitchen Sink and Corn Beef Hash.  True to it's name, the kitchen sink had a little of everything, bacon, sausage, ham, mushrooms, 2 maybe 3 kinds of cheese, beans, bell peppers and more.  Sampling all the entrees put me into a food coma so my memory fails me.  The corn beef hash is homemade.  Yum!!Served with fried potatoes and your choice of banana or pumpkin bread.  Think extra thick potato chips.  Crunchy on the outside, some with soft centers.  My favorite was the banana bread.  Definitely will be back the next time I am in Vegas!  Not soon enough for hubby......  P.S.  Check out the \"Flatlanders\" special.  Reserved for the adventurous."}
{"text":"Service is great! The portion is big. One plate is good for 2 people or take it to go"}
{"text":"Super omelets and egg benedict. Had the lobster avocado eggs benedict, amazing, tons of avocado and lobster chuncks, would come back. Service was fast and staff was helpful and very helpful and friendly. Highly recommended to all."}
{"text":"Food AMAZING! Portions were HUGE! And the staff was friendly and quick. We will definitely make this a regular stop when we are in town."}
{"text":"The food is typical diner fare but the waffle is really really gooood. I love the waffle and go there at lunch time just for it. I am not a big egg liver so I'd never be able to fairly review the omelets, but they are massive and have many choices. They also offer many burgers and other breakfast items. The pancakes aren't a bad option either, but again, I highly recommend the waffle."}
{"text":"Food is good. Home style Potato chips are oily. Serving size is big and equally priced. Coffee tastes bad. Not one of the finest breakfast places with fresh and nice servings, pastries etc. But still manageable with huge omelets variety they have."}
{"text":"Great prices ad big portions.   Come early because we came for breakfast and with a table of 10 waited about 45 mins. The turn over for food was pretty fast they were jammed pack.   I don't think their breakfast tasted special. Nothing better than Denny's. Only thing I could rave about was how crisp their bacon was. But I wouldn't come back just for that.   Service was good but nothing over the top. We had to ask for refills and for to go boxes."}
{"text":"One of the best places you can eat in Henderson. Meatloaf sandwich is my favorite but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Cathy and Amber are our favorite waitresses and the entire staff is ALWAYS friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! 6 of us ate & we all had somthing different. French toast, pancakes, omelet, chicken fried steak, sausage patty n eggs, & even a hamburger -- the patty was homemade.  The hash browns are out of this world!! A++++"}
{"text":"The potatoes are AMAZING...   Everything else (omelets, pancake and chicken fried steak) was really good too...  But the potatoes! Best.Thing.Ever."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  The staff are amazing.   I shared the lobster omelet with my wife.   We were both extremely full. The banana nut bread melted in my mouth with the walnuts crunching behind the scenes of my mouth.   Wow."}
{"text":"This was a breakfast stop on our way back to AZ. Excellent service. Was greeted and sat right away. Them were served beverages quickly.  There are more than 30 omelets on the menu along with the standard breakfast offerings. The omelets are made with 6 eggs. Needles to say, we split the #16 and each plate came with Potatoes as well as your choice of bread.  The food was excellent. The coffee cup was never empty.  The ambiance was \"old school\" decor with pictures of classic cars and old fashioned appliances and Christmas decorations. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty food! Portions huge and enough for an additional meal. Ordered an omelet that included home made sliced potatoes and warm banana nut bread."}
{"text":"I did not have the same experience as many of these other reviewers which is surprising.  I met a colleague here for breakfast during the week and we were greeted promptly - service was fine.  I ordered the Petunia Pig omelet and my colleague ordered the Corn Beef Hash.  The food portions were big, but the taste was lacking.  My eggs were a bit overcooked and did not have enough cheese or meat in the omelet.  The \"homemade potato chips\" which accompanied the dish were nothing special - would have preferred hash browns.  The toast was dry.  I just wasn't impressed.  I've had many other breakfasts here in Vegas including the other Omelet House in Henderson (which was great).  Not sure what went wrong today."}
{"text":"I love it great location no Vegas parking fees hehe, but most of all just great breakfast choices I just want to eat good food and not go into a casino love places like this, classic Vegas decor"}
{"text":"Went here after a post-Xmas and it was pretty good. The portions are huge and they have that old-timey feel inside. You feel like you are in Michigan or somewhere woodsy inside. I ordered the corn beef hash which was huge. They don't have hash browns but use these homemade potato chips instead. They are good, but I really wish I had more hash with my hash, if you get me. I tried the banana bread which was warm and delicious too, but very filling. The waitresses were so friendly and attentive. Shermaine was always on it for the coffee refills which is great. Nothing worse than cold or empty coffee.  Definitely a good local spot and one I would gladly come back to patronize."}
{"text":"Althoug I'd already had breakfast. Meeting family for lunch, someone mentioned this place.  i had the 38 special with out cheese ( I'm off dairy)  It was sooo good.  i was too embarrased to eat the whole thing, so i took some of it back to my hotel.  it didn't last long. :-) My cousin made me try the banana nut bread. (she made me i said).  it was delish!   This place is on my list of places to visit whe I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious food the entire staff are great ppl and attentive.  Customer service was awesome, thank you Devenn and crew for the great service and delicious monster of a meal..."}
{"text":"My family and I came here on a Saturday morning. Thankfully it wasn't crazy packed like other breakfast joints get over the weekends.  I guess that could have been an indicator for us, but we just didn't realize it at the time. We all ordered omelets with the exception of French Toast, Eggs Benedict, and a kids Chicken Fingers meal. The Eggs Benedict that I had was extremely salty.  And I think this had to do with the thick slices of ham they used.  I ended up removing the ham and eating small bits of it along with the rest of the benedict.  We also weren't a fan of their potatoes.  Our server informed us that they came out wrong.  Because they were definitely hard and crunchy.  We kept joking that they had to be some sort of potato chips.  The server kindly asked if we wanted to get them replaced with the proper way they should be cooked, but we were unimpressed by all the other food that we didn't bother. I do like how they offer to split the omelets up, since they are so large.  However I don't like how they charge for the $1 split. Just give us an extra plate and we'll do it ourselves!"}
{"text":"hands down best omlettes in town and service is excellent .. found this place while visiting a friend in the nearby hospital and they have won me as a lifetime customer! the californian porky pig ect the list can go and on all great choices!!!"}
{"text":"The two star rating was not for the food because my boyfriend enjoyed his lobster omelet, and my french toast stuffed with blueberry jam was delicious, but rather, it was for the dismissive customer service.  We arrived on a non-busy Wednesday morning. This is a local's joint, but I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the absence in customer service that morning.  It was odd that when my boyfriend and I were seated, the waitress NEVER returned to our table to take our orders. I forgot her name otherwise it would've been mentioned on here. She had passed us a few times, and I think she had forgotten about us. There was one occasion where she even asked us how we were doing, but she still managed to not take our orders. I'm not sure if this was an off-day for her, but the restaurant was not busy. It was strange, and it left me feeling uncomfortable.  I finally had the nerve to flag down another waitress and informed her that we were ready to order. She rudely communicated this to our waitress, and finally she came over and jotted down our orders. She apologized, but it was an empty apology, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt nonetheless.  Our dishes were delicious, don't get me wrong. The coffee could've been more bold because it was very light and watery. I'm picky with my coffee (I grind my own beans at home) and was left disappointed that the coffee didn't give me an extra kick.  Anywho, I still tipped the waitress generously, but I hope that she learns her lesson to be more attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  The staff was very friendly and the food came out fast!  Large portion sizes gave this restaurant choice an excellent value as a Sunday breakfast stop!"}
{"text":"Great variety. The adventurous and the safe will be happy. Get a half portion because it's too much food. Cozy and creaks like a old house. Despite the side of town it's on I never seen any weirdos in the parking lot. Good for a morning after meal. Service is pleasant."}
{"text":"The food was great but what really stood out was the service. Our server was quick, kind and never let our coffee cups get empty. Can't wait to return on my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"As a breakfast junkie from the Midwest I know a good breakfast when I see one. This place offered the best diner style breakfast I have ever enjoyed.   My teenage kid who can eat tables of food was unable to finish his food. So there's just enough."}
{"text":"as breakfast joints in vegas go - hell, you can go to any casino and get a plate of eggs, bacon and toast for like .99 cents.  but if you want a hearty 6 egg omlent served with the house style chips, or homemade corned beef hash and eggs, or just fish and chips - this is the spot. everything is served with your choice of bread, buscuit or toast - but get the PUMPKIN bread, or if they have it the BANANA NUT bread - made from scratch and worth the price of admission.  we love the 50's flair, the locals feel, and the service. but its the choice of like 30 different types of omlettes on the menu that makes this place famous - my personal favorite: chile verde omlette. o yeah."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place over 5 years ago while attending EDC LAS VEGAS. Since then this is my go to place for breakfast whenever I go to Vegas! The food is delicious, the servers are very friendly and nice & the place looks and feels like you're at home getting food from the omelette gods! Lol"}
{"text":"Ok. I am reviewing this for me and my bud James V. He had the Farmer 1 and it was delicious. The potato chips were amazing. I had the Petunia Pig. It was much drier than the Farmer. So I down check that one but again, chips were fantastic. The short stack was AWEsome. So good.   Last was the coffee. I had coffee yesterday at some place that tasted like liquid pavement. Today, I had liquid gold. So good. Thank you."}
{"text":"Was a great pit stop on way back from Hoover Dam with our tour group.  Pretty splendid."}
{"text":"Hugh omelettes and delicious banana bread.  Coffee was very good too and the servers kept the refills going.  Nice friendly place and I look forward to trying other items on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Portions are Yummy and HUGE.  Why didn't I give it a 5?  NO wow factor..but still a great place to eat...I would go back in a second."}
{"text":"The boyfriend, friends, and I went here this past weekend. We were looking for a good breakfast, with good service... and barely achieved either.  I'll just describe my omelet, as there were 6 of us, so that would take quite a bit of time.  I ordered an omelet with lobster and cheese, avocado on the side. The \"lobster\" was pretty tasty.. (quotations because i'm not sure how real it was.. i'm guessing it was the cheap precooked kind) ..the omelet was terribly dry and overcooked, but the massive amount of cheese in the middle helped. I also got 1 orange juice.. why just 1? Because our waiter never came back. And it took 3 times of asking \"can we get a box to go?\" for him to FINALLY give us one.  I suppose the plus to this place is the wide variety of choices. They really do have anything you could possibly imagine, mixed into their omelets. (They also serve pancakes and waffles)..  When we went to go pay, the girl at the register was more than pissed off when we split the bill 3 ways. It took me no more than 22 seconds to circle, dot, and check what belonged to whom. And the whole time, she was sighing, and rolling her eyes. Yikes.  I will admit, only 1 person from our group of 5 left our waiter a tip. Sorry. Not so much though.. he was an awfully inattentive server.  The pumpkin bread was good, but microwaved...trying to mimic \"fresh baked\" hotness. Well, if you've ever microwaved anything before and then let it cool, you know it gets rubbery and hard as a rock, right? Bingo.  If you want cheap-close-to-dennys-but-not-dennys style food, enjoy yourself here. just don't assume to be treated like a customer, more like a bother."}
{"text":"The great debate: which is better, the banana bread or the pumpkin bread? I liked the pumpkin, my wife thought the banana was better.   The omelettes were very good with lots of filling. Would have preferred a different style of potatoes.  All in all a good place for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is a staple in Las Vegas! Family owned old school diner style breakfast house. They just know how to do it right here.  I've come here on countless occasions when at UMC hospital. Just good food, service, and feel every time.   They have a plethora of customs omelettes with countless combinations if you want to make your own. What I love is a normal size omelette is 6 eggs!! No one else does that! That's amazing.   I haven't had a chance to have the pancakes or French toast. But just by looking at the menu and how they make them (fruit cooked inside the pancake) - that's how you're supposed to do it.  When here, you have to try the freshly made banana nut bread with butter. Soooo...good!  If you are a spuds fan, then you will love this place because that's all they serve. I'm a little disappointed that you can't swap the spuds for fruit, oatmeal, potatoes, hash browns, or even greens. That would be a great improvement if they could one or all of these.   Definitely a staple of Vegas and a must try if you want to be happily stuffed for just good clean breakfast."}
{"text":"I got a huge omelet and my husband got biscuits and gravy. They were both excellent! I will definitely come here again when I pass through town!"}
{"text":"If your in Vegas and looking for a great all around breakfast, this is the place. Get out of your hotel and give it a try. The food is fresh, good portions and the service is excellent, with a home town feel right outside the craziness of Vegas. You can't get food like this at your hotel.   Side note, the owner is a gentleman. Myself and three friends were standing outside after our meal waiting for a cab to take us a short distance away. We were late for a conference. The owner came out and said that we would be waiting for a while and gave us a ride in his own car. Thank you for a great experience! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"New to the area and was completing new hire orientation across the street so was there 3 days in a row. Wish I would have gotten all three pics but I did get 2!  First off, every single person who saw me standing there waiting to be seated asked if I had been helped so I was waiting like 45 seconds. SUPER friendly, fast and efficient. This is the quickest place I think I have ever been to. Like....ever. But they don't lack in quality which is the amazing thing!  The first 2 days I had different omelettes.....both were delicious. Last day I was in a MEGA hurry (but they are always fast...) I couldn't believe it when my food came even faster just because I said I needed to get out of there in a hurry and the food was still fresh and tasted great!  You get HUGE portions - like I could order an omelette and split it. I would have taken portions home but it would have sat in my hot car and that wouldn't have been good. Prices are reasonable so no need. Last day I got a sandwich expecting that it would be just ok since it is an omelette place, the sandwiches wouldn't be all that great. BUT I was pleasantly surprised!   Everything I have eaten here has been fab, service is excellent and very, very quick with orders and it is still fresh! I would absolutely recommend and would go out of my way to come back often. Zero complaints as everything was better than expected. Wow. I think I will even bring out of town visitor here to this location. Yeah - it was that good. Wish I would have cut into the omelette and THEN taken the pic because it was stuffed full of goodies and not just a wad of egg. It's worth it. Go there. I'm sure I'll be back and I'll update with pics of the insides. ;)"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant. $11.99 for a 6 egg omlete. I ordered the banana nut bread with my breakfast and my husband got the pumpkin nut bread. We agreed that the banana nut was better. Order the 3 egg omelete....the 6 eggs is way to much egg.  Most of their meals are homemade.  Staff is really nice and excellent service."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to get breakfast after being outside in the early hours of the morning. I came here after getting a recommendation from my tour guide Paul at the Henderson Bird Preserve, and boy, I was in for a treat! The staff was friendly, and the food is really good! Come here hungry because the omelettes are HUGE. I had to take my food with me, but it was worth it, because I finished it for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Was told if this place by Pete at Harrah's while i waited for my rental car. Omelets were big snd tasty. The lumpkin bread is home made and worth the trip all vy itself. Had potatoes that were sluced thinly and complimented the omelet very nicely. I recommend the Omelet House to anyone with a car in Las Vegas snd the surrounding areas. definitely competition for Denny's. All that was missing was grits."}
{"text":"I'm from California and this is the best place in Vegas from the drinks to the food to the employees there customer service was amazing my family loved it we were a family of 25 and literally they seated us all together in under 3 minutes. The atmosphere around my kid and nephews was really friendly. I recommend this amazing restaurant to everyone and anyone who wants to try something new in Las Vegas. Overall my family and I were very satisfied and we are definitely going there every time we go on vacation to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband & i stopped by before our long drive to the Grand Canyon & everyone was really nice to us, very friendly & super attentive! Wish there was one in LA  next time we hit Vegas, we will definitely make time for this spot. Cant wait to go back & eat their Banana bread"}
{"text":"AMAZING customer service! From the front desk to while exiting. We were taken care of the whole time. Our refills never went low. Our food was cooked to perfection. The biggest thing was my food. I'm changing my eating habits but my family invited me to eat. I have to be able to go anywhere and continue my journey. My order was custom ordered and I got exactly what I asked for no complaints and with a smile on her face. We were laughing with our waitress and she remembered certain thing to come back with jokes. There was a gentleman that made sure we were also taking care of with creamers and refills and he has a smile on his face while doing so. It was a really nice experience for my family and I. That was my first time there so I will be returning ! Thank you to your staff, and restaurant manager for the amazing service."}
{"text":"Still the best pancakes in town, but they're not big fluffy dry \"pancake mix \" hotcakes so if that's what you like, avoid these babies.   Chicken fried steak was excellent and I'm still not sure why people complain that they want the same old shredded potatoes that every other place in town serves up, because SPUDS are unique and delicious.   Service was a little slow today and spuds were a bit UNDER cooked, not sure what was going on in the kitchen, the restaurant didn't seem overly busy."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Huge portions. Great service. I'm glad that we came across this place. Coffee is excellent. Service goes beyond imagination;))"}
{"text":"Loved the food and customer service. It was my first visit but not my last. Wish they were open 24 hrs or at least until dinner time..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I'll definitely be a returning customer, the service was fast and friendly as corny as that sounds.. the food was excellent and came out super fast.. across the parking lot is a Jimmy Johns, I think Omelet House is giving there neighbor a run for there money when it comes to freaky fast service. I was skeptical about the place when I pulled up, but once I stepped in all doubts flew out the window. 4 stars for this place, only because of its location. Otherwise was a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is so great! I would have given it a 5 star rating, but I'm not a fan of the decor and plus the booths needs work. Besides all that the food is NEVER a disappointment. I love the option of pumpkin or banana bread with you meal. The breads come out hot, fresh, and begging to be smothered with butter. The portions are HUGE and cooked very well. It's like they've been doing it so long, it's effortless perfection. The potatoes are thinly sliced and grilled to almost a potato chip consistency. The omelets are never over cooked, done just right. I've tried several omelets with egg whites and I enjoyed all of them. My boys like the stuffed french toast or the bacon, egg, and hash. I've become a breakfast snob after eating here. I definitely could never go back to IHOP or Denny's. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the this place! Huge selection of omelettes. We had the lobster omelette. Super fluffy and big enough to share. The corned beef hash is house-made and out of this world ! I can't say enough good night hints about this place. High quality food , very reasonably priced. Very good service"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant through Yelp on vacation in Vegas food and service where excellent. Made my eating husband tap out large portions great price ! Banana nut bread is a must try they give you butter but it is so moist don't need it"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!!!! My family was coming back from Vegas and we decided to come here because of all of the great reviews. I opted for chocolate chip waffles while the rest of the family got various omelettes. Little did they know that each omelette is made up for SIX EGGS! Had we known that we would have spilt it. Our server Shawna was amazing! She is a beast because she carried out four of the massive omelettes plus four other dishes all at once. That is some major arm strength. The service was wonderful. People always coming around to make sure our water and coffee is topped off. There was even a lady making balloon animals. The spuds lived up to all of the hype as well. You gotta get the banana and/or pumpkin bread because they are to die for. I will definitely be coming back whenever I have to head up this way."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food. I ordered the waffles with a side of their \"spuds\", and both were great. True to their name, they have a huge selection of different omelets. Their portions of omelets are huge, but you can order a smaller size for 89 cents less.   The reason this place did not get five stars from me is because the decor is horrible. They really need to get rid of the fake flowers and knick knacks everywhere. I would go back, but they need to redecorate."}
{"text":"Just picked up an order what a mess. It seems like place is usually good. Its a shame this restaurants owner maybe manager probably takes a lot of pride in this business but without proper management or accountability they could lose more business. The phone didn't work. Not a big deal so I just walked in and placed an order. When I got the food, the waiter nearly forgot to take payment then when I gave him my money he asked if I wanteu change back. Uh... Once I left I realized I didn't get part of my order. My fault I should've checked. The food was negligently packed, food spilled everywhere though I held it up right. The food is good but whoever is managing the morning shift has to hold the employees more accountable because without decent service they won't retain new customers"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Service was excellent and shout out to Kevin who made sure everything was great!!"}
{"text":"Walking into this place is much like going back in time. It almost feels wrong using a cell phone inside.  It has a farmhouse type of feel--but not in a modernized, trying-to-hard-to-be-farmhouse-type of way. Like, you know it looked like that long before it was cool to look like that.   The omelets are incredibly well-priced. They were pretty much all $11 for a 6 egg omelet (only 50 cents more for egg whites), unless you wanted a 3 egg omelet--then it's $1 less.  I got the My Little Chick-a-Dee Omelet, which had white chicken breast, onion, broccoli, and cheddar cheese. It was pretty tasty. Not the strongest of flavors, but nice and light.  My fiancee got the Rio Grande Surfer, which included chorizo sausage and cheddar cheese. I'm usually not a big chorizo fan, but this was really good quality.   Each omelet comes with their house made potato chips, which have an oddly appealing anti-crunch to them. Absolutely addicting, but when are potato chips NOT addicting? Nonetheless, I loved the unique spin they put on them.  The honest truth is you can't beat this place price-wise. My favorite omelets are at the Peppermill across town, but those are still 4 dollars more than this place (albeit, tastier). But if you want to support a cool little piece of off-the-strip history, go to the Omelet House and you won't be disappointed. Plus, the staff is really homey and friendly."}
{"text":"Cute place tucked in a strip mall next to a Smith's. Standard, though extensive breakfast menu, there are like 20 different incarnations of omelettes avavailable.  The lobster eggs benedict will make you curl your toes, its amazing. Portions are generous. I couldn't finish my omelette and hash browns, and I'm known for harboring a lumberjack's appetite in my track athlete frame.  I shared an order of pumpkin bread right out of the oven. Slathered with butter, it was a taste of heaven."}
{"text":"We go to the Omelette House at least a couple of times every Vegas trip we make. Almost every element to critique for this place ranks outstanding; specifically service, food and cleanliness. The prices are par for the experience and the wait times for a table can get lengthy on the weekends. The entire staff is friendly, courteous and on top of their duties. No changes... we'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good breakfast place near the Palace Station on yelp and ran across this hidden gem only about a mile from there, and would definitely come back along with bringing some freinds to. The prices are fair the food had great flavor and was all homemade. But our waitress Priscilla was just the best!"}
{"text":"Amazing Omletes the Staff (Melia) was extra awesome - if your a corned beef fan you have to have the Hash!! WOW-  If your in Vegas it's a must do for breakfast-"}
{"text":"Love this place, great to come with the family and enjoy breakfast and choose from there 39 different omlettes and bread of choice to start your breakfast. Theres many options and the staff is just amazing! They never dissapoint."}
{"text":"Food was average but waitress was terrible! Asked what was on cajun salad...she didn't know and didn't offer to ask! She tantrumed when we asked for separate checks. She rolled her eyes when my friend asked to add a salad."}
{"text":"Those who read my reviews know I have A LOT to say.   But for once, I shut up and just shoveled the massive amounts of food they serve here down my gullet.  And to reflect that mood, I will keep this review as short and sweet as I am able to do.  -Sub egg whites for $1 more -Make it a three egg omelette instead of the regular 6, -$ .95 -Chicken fried steak is a MUST try. -Try the pumpkin bread. . .I'm hesitant to say this but. . .it's better than the one I make (and I make a damn good one!)  Eat here next time you're in Vegas. . .I sure will!"}
{"text":"Great food, big portions and excellent customer service. I don't care for the free banana bread or the coffee or the decor"}
{"text":"We orderd the lobster eggs benedict, it was delicious and we will defintely come back next time we are in Las Vegas! The spuds are amazinG!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. You have to eat the banana bread. They gave us a huge slice and we ate it in record time. Also, the restaurant is decorated with tons of knick-knacks which is equal parts hilarious and weird. We'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Don't hesitate just go!!!!! This place is quirky, fun and the food is phenomenal!!!! I picked this off of yelp as we don't want to have breakfast in our hotel and wanted some local flavor. We split an philly omelette and some corn beef hash. There is nothing to say but wow!! I can be a big eater after a night out and just half the omelette the fried potatoes were more than enough to fill me up. I could only eat a little of the hash that was awesome as well. If you get the chance just go you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Came for quick breakfast.  Food and service are moderately good.  Price is reasonable compared to main strip dinning.  Looks like family own business with farm house style decor.  Mainly local eating here so ambience is very casual and relax.  Small parking lot but sufficient parking spaces."}
{"text":"If you love omelette's you need this place in your life. everyone is so friendly. i fell in love with our waitress a much older woman with a southern draw. they make their own chips!!! how awesome is that ?! the omelettes are huge covering a little more than half the plate.  I'm a huge breakfast guy and this place is legitimately great!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, tons of variety and great customer service. Any omelette you can think of!  Massive portions with great value!"}
{"text":"It's got an anti-Las Vegas exterior in a strip center , but the food and service is great.  Had the delicious breakfast scrambler along with their wonderful coffee.  Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I like going there a few times a month, Food served is more than enough to feed a family of 5...lol  Very cheap cost for what you are getting... Weekends its always packed and for good reason... Love this place..."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Quick local homey-diner type feel with great service and excellent food.  The homemade banana bread was to die for.  We went for breakfast/brunch and I had one of their omelet's which was on point.  Their spuds were amazing as well! Can't go wrong at this place!"}
{"text":"I like the appeal of the old decor inside. The service was okay. Our drinks were never refilled. The problem I have with this place is the food that we ordered. I like getting corned beef hash and their menu says the best ever so I obviously went for it. The corned beef hash tastes a lot like canned corned beef. I absolutely despise restaurants that charge 12 dollars for canned food. I'm sure the omelets are fantastic but based on the fact that their corned beef hash is advertised as made fresh, I wouldn't trust anything else being made with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great selection. The banana bread is super moist and yummy. The place was packed and the staff was still super quick and pleasant."}
{"text":"I wrote a review for the Maryland Parkway location of the Omelet House, but here's one for the Henderson one and this is it:  This is the only place in old Henderson where you should even think about having breakfast.  The line's usually long, but they whip you through pretty quickly  The decor is a mish mash of trailer park staples, but it works.(Man, this building has been every restaurant that's every existed over the past 30 years, I'm amazed it's survived.)  The omelets are huge and fresh and expertly created.  ALL of their breakfasts are amazing.  This is one of those places to come after a hard partyin' night to get yourself back on an even keel.  Those spuds are magical."}
{"text":"Good breakfast , it was huge and delicious !!! Love it, will definitely come back next time when visiting Las Vegas !"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for establishments with a comfort food feel and a tasty bakery item as a side option. The vintage kitchen appliances throughout the place gives it an even homey-er feel.  I always get the Green Hornet omelet. Loaded with my favorite veggies and my favorite protein, this breakfast choice of mine gives me energy to accomplish all of my Sunday errands. Sometimes, if I eat all of my banana bread that accompanies my meal, I only find the energy to take a long nap, but either outcome, the food is always on par.  Added fun stuff:  -I like the 'we aren't going anywhere' sign I see as I drive up. It gives me a great deal of comfort.  -the hidden easter egg/fake menu item in the middle of the menu. Fun!"}
{"text":"Outstanding omelette and waffles. Got the cowboy one. Will definitely go again. The waffle was even fresh in the afternoon.  The portions are huge."}
{"text":"Our first time here, the food is excellent and freshly made every day. The wait staff is nice, friendly and very patient when you don't know what you would like to order. We had service with a smile that made our meal that much pleasurable. I must also add they're not shy with the portions so make sure you come hungry. Before going back to California we'll stop by here again (our new favorite breakfast spot)."}
{"text":"This place is the frickin' bomb!  Huge omelets at great prices.  Customer service here is remarkable.  The owner is always there and goes the extra mile to make sure you enjoy your visit.  Servers are friendly, your order comes out fast, and the line to be seated moves very quickly.  I come here every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to come and eat when we come for lacrosse.  The portions are huge, the service is always great and the menu has a million choices.  Come for breakfast, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One word AWESOME!  This place has a great staff who is very friendly!  Great customer service! Now the best part is the FOOD!   Definitely stop and eat here!"}
{"text":"The corned beef hash made me feel good about eating here,  no cans allowed.  Then I had the Lobster and Jack cheese omelet. The lobsters were fresh caught from Lake Mead earlier this morning. They had to open two more locations to handle the hungry throng of diners anxiously awaiting the best breakfast grub this side of the Rockies. Ask for Terri, she'll treat you right."}
{"text":"My group and I came here on our way out of Nevada. We're glad we came! The food is fantastic along with the hospitality.  I ordered the Flap Special, which comes with four pieces of bacon instead of two! (The breakfast specials exclude weekends and holidays, FYI.) Along with my crispy bacon came two buttermilk pancakes and eggs. The pancakes were light and fluffy, and my eggs were over medium. I also got to try out their sausage patties, and I am a bit skeptical of those, but everything together came out excellently. The food was cooked to a T. I only had water to drink, and it tasted just fine.  Altogether, my meal came out to be $9.61 with tax. I would definitely recommend this place with its great service. Thank you, Amy!!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've ever had in awhile. From the scrumptious banana bread muffin with a wallop of pumpkin spice, to the Philly cheese steak omelette -- this is absolutely a must have if you come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Found this little Gem during our last trip to Vegas. We wanted breakfast but not on the strip we yelped up places and spotted this place not far from us. Man were we happy we did all 4 of us in our group could not find something to complain about. Everything perfect. Now this is an Old School diner type place it's only open for breakfast and lunch and closes at 3pm so you know what they do is good. I ordered Chicken Fried Steak, hadn't had this in about 5 years, it was Fantastic. The steak nice and crispy the gravy had great flavor and tasted completely homemade. Now those potatoes I would go back just for those home fried potatoes. We all agreed the coffee was very good and for my wife to say coffee is good that's few and far between because she is a  Starbucks Addict. The waitress was very friendly and completely on top of our needs. If in Vegas you must give this place a try!"}
{"text":"FOOD: Large servings of food.  The omelets are 6 eggs so you can easily share with 2 or 3 people.  We had the pancakes and country fried steak omelet.  Love the potatoes  and gravy. The pancakes are so good; syrup not necessary.   SERVICE: we were sat immediately; no wait on a Friday morning.  Decor is 70-80s eccletic. The servers were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Found this place on LivingSocial.com....was a great purchase.  GREAT food and prices. Huge portions and decent prices.  Would go again when back in Vegas.  Looked forward to going back the next day.  Recommend to anyone.  The corned beef and hash was the best!"}
{"text":"you had better come hungry! the omelets are 6 eggs omelets, compared to a standard 3 egg elsewhere. the pumpkin and banana breads are served warm with butter- more like a dessert than appetizer.   everything was exactly as described and  was delicious and fair priced. definitely get off the strip and get over here for a hangover brunch!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but this place  has some kind of sentimental value to me. Every time I come to Vegas I come here, even though I know theres a million other places to try.  I'm not sure if it's the memories I've had here, the banana nut bread, the omelets or what. I can fondly remember every booth or seat I've sat in, and who I came with. I love the staff, they are thoughtful efficient and great!"}
{"text":"Eat here on a regular basis. Love the potatoes which are made kinda like a chip. Big portions that are well priced. Cute and comfortable ambience and friendly attentive staff. Also the banana muffin is delicious! Highly recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Food was so good! The banana bread was the best I've had and their homemade potato chips are addicting! It is worth the short drive off strip. Will definitely come by again next time we are in Vegas.  The servers are amazing and very attentive, my coffee cup was always full and my water was never lower than half the glass. Wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"Our experience was an incredible one. The staff were all very kind, friendly, and wanted to make sure we experienced the best breakfast Vegas has to offer. They definitely succeeded and we'll be back for their outstanding breakfast, atmosphere and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for omelets in Las Vegas, the selection of omelets is amazing and are very much worth every penny. The chip style potatoes that come with your omelet are seasoned to perfection and are also delicious. This is a must do in Vegas for breakfast."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is homey and inviting. I like that they have country lightly playing on the speakers, which goes well with the farm themed decor. Staff is friendly. We had a wait time (brunch hour) of about 10 min which wasn't bad at all. Drinks were brought out immediately by our waitress followed by their signature pumpkin bread. It was devine and definitely satisfied our hangry tummies. Our meals came out pretty quickly. In the 3 times I've visited, I've never had to wait an extensive time period for my food, which is nice.   Everything smelled delicious; plates were presentable and generously portioned. I ordered the french toast special with bacon (4 large pcs) $ 8.99 with a side of spuds $1.99. The french toast was eggy with the right amount of firmness. I hate when its soggy, but no worries here...it was perfect. The eggs were good, but I'm not sure if they use real eggs or an egg liquid for scrambled. Hubs got eggs over easy and those were obviously real eggs and cooked just right. The bacon was a good mix of crunchy and chewy. It could have been a little crispier for my own personal taste, but it was still quite yummy. Who doesn't love bacon? The spuds were my fave next to the pumpkin bread. They are almost chip like, but with the right amount of crispness and breakfast spud appeal. I practically ate the whole plate without realizing...so they are deliciously addicting.  Hubs ordered the chicken fried steak, which he described as being tender with a crispy breading. The gravy had a nice, thick consistency and good flavor.   This is a nice, clean place with reasonably priced breakfast. Overall, we were quite pleased with this place and our empty plates can attest to that.  We will come again."}
{"text":"Amazing service, incredible food.  Take a huge appetite....even the 3 egg omelette was too big for 1 person.  Fabulous choices and delicious homemade breads!!! This place is a must!"}
{"text":"I was out in Vegas for a friends b-day back in Jan.  We wanted to grab some breakfast and didn't feel like a buffet, or any other tourists traps, so I looked this place us and decided to check it out.  The place is pretty big, and looks str8 from the 70's (maybe 80's).  Certainly not the best place in terms of ambience, but if you're more concerned about food, then this is your place.    The servers were very friendly, almost motherly.  They had the whole team approach going and all of them seemed more than happy to help us with our requests and inquiries.  Their menu is pretty large, and has all the breakfast specials, plus a couple interesting specialties- (my sister got a lobster omlette, or lobster benedict... something with lobster).  I opted to get the omlette and my wife got a sandwich.  My friend just got a standard bacon and eggs.  When we got our food we were blown away!  The servings were HUGE, and all of us were more than satisfied with our orders.  My sister was very surprised by the lobster.  Not only was it plentiful, but it was good too which was a very nice bonus.  The omlette was ENORMOUS.   Everyone at the table was trying to help me finish (heck we were all trying to help one another finish).  The other thing I heard about this place was their pumpkin bread- it ws pretty damn good.  Maybe not as orgasm inducing as some people might claim, but warm and tasty.    Overall, we were very happy we took a chance on this place.  They have another location in Las Vegas, but since my friend lives in Henderson we checked this one out.  Breakfast fans won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! Stopped by for breakfast while traveling. Food and service is amazing. Portion sizes are huge, it was a struggle to eat everything. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Since I got back from Asia - it seems like the food portions here in the States have gotten bigger. Especially when I dropped in for breakfast at the Omelet House on Charleston.   It's been forever and a day since I last ate here and the parking sucks just as bad once the other businesses open up. The wait wasn't bad but there were a few larger parties that had to wait for their turn. I lucked out as I got there early enough and a party of one is easier to seat than two large parties.   I don't like leaving food as much as I don't care for leftovers and the portions were so big that I ended up leaving a quarter of my breakfast because I couldn't take it to go because I'd be out and about all day and it probably wouldn't have kept. The breads are awesome which I know I ate too much of - and the Omelet I had, pretty much the Denver, was tasty enough to where I didn't drop on any condiments, like hot sauce etc.   Service was ok but I think the fact that my face was buried in the paper was a sign to just take my order, bring my food, bring refills and bring my bill when I was done. I didn't need nor want much more than that.   Anyway - I was a fan back in the say - I guess I still am. Just forgot about this place after all these years."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great breakfast, super-friendly service, old cafe style, can't ask for much better."}
{"text":"Growing up in Vegas brings a lot of unique experiences, but one that I can't imagine living without is breakfast at the Omelet House.  There are a few locations throughout the valley, and the quality is the same across the board.  The omelets are freakin' HUGE.  We're talkin' the size of your head HUGE, and they're the best made omelets in town as well.  I watched my (very hungover) roommate once eat an entire one because of the busboy's soft and slightly degrading exclamation of, \"Oh, and you almost finished all of it!\"  That's the only time I've seen such a feat.  I'm a sucker for the eggs benedict and if you're a fan of slightly fried, slightly mushy, slightly salty, and 100% all delicious things, the potatoes that come with almost every meal are a godsend.  The service can run the gamut between \"Holy crap, I can't believe there's already delicious food swirling in my mouth.  It's almost like they beamed it there!\" to, \"Holy CRAP! I think I need to go change my Depends.\"  (That last one works best if you're a senior citizen or an astronaut.)  To make this unknown factor more fun and less annoying, place bets on the speed of your service before you arrive.  Just don't try to tip your server with the potatoes.  They may look like gaming chips, but let's not take this too far, shall we?"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and the food was better than I'd expected. I had the chicken soup and it was full of big hunks of tender white meat. Delicious!  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Much better than expected. Large portions. I only ate half my omelet! Got enough for lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing food, even better service. Well worth the short trip off the strip. I hate repeating restaurants while on vacation, however, we will be back this week. I had the Californian, out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by The Omelet House for a late breakfast with my daughter today.  I ordered the french toast special.  Again my meal was perfectly prepared-the french toast was golden brown, the bacon was crispy and the scrambled eggs were melt in your mouth delicious.  Jose, our server, was promptly attentive to us with everything we wanted and did it in a efficient and friendly way.  I have been a customer here since the late '80s because it is exactly what a dining experience should be."}
{"text":"this is one of those types of places with almost too many choices.  I kept eying different omelet combos until the waitress finally arrived. got one with broccoli, chicken, cheddar and onion (I think). it was enormous and filling (proud I made it through a little more than half) but not heavy. the potatoes were yummy but the pumpkin bread I also ordered was pretty dry.  this place could have potentially warranted five stars but the waitress was a bit on the bitchy side. she just seemed annoyed that she had to be working.  don't know if I'd rush back here if I came back to town but it's excellent if you're craving a good omelet."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places I went to. When you frist come inaide they are very welcome to have tou there and ready to serve you. The food is really good here cant wait to come back one day when I have the say off ha lol!"}
{"text":"How can reviewers not give this place 5 stars?  We were staying on the strip in Las Vegas and headed out of town for the Hoover Dam.  It was so nice to get away from the strip and have a REAL breakfast.  I had the corned beef and hash with over medium eggs.  BEST corned beef and hash I have ever had.  It's your typical greasy spoon, hole in the wall type place.  Prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get.  We saw all the signs on the strip for \"all you can eat breakfast\" buffets starting at like $25 a person...yeah sure it is all you can eat, but can a person really eat $25 worth of food at a buffet (ok maybe some people can, but that is besides the point).  We got 2 very large breakfasts for 2 people for under $20.  Well worth the extra drive out of town to get to it.  If you are looking for a good breakfast place away from the strip try this place out!"}
{"text":"Love their locomoco breakfast plate! Big portion & tasted great....pretty busy when we got their, wait time was like 20mins but it was a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"Gigantic portions of delicious food. My partner and I went last time we were in Vegas and decided to come again for this trip as well. Staff is very friendly. Good family owned diner."}
{"text":"Best pancakes around. Staff is always friendly the breakfast is always delicious. Portions are massive , makes a great brunch location, 7am-3pm.  My favorite is the cinnamon apple topped pancakes . However they are best known for..  Omelettes.  With 38 to chose from you will definitely find something you like. Give it a try and you'll see."}
{"text":"Another good breakfast spot. Serves all the great dishes that the other omelet house restaurants do. All the staff are very pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"Pumpkin and banana bread amazing good service interior rundown And they need to clean better definitely in need of tlc.   Now the food ..... Portions huge omlets amazing everything cooked perfectly taste almost perfect.    Service - 7 to 8 out of 10 but the place was busy so it is what it is. Let me add that once she brings the check she basically shuts down nice mode and goes into omg get out mode"}
{"text":"We like to venture off the strip looking for great place to eat, JACKPOT! Absolutely delicious,  great customer service! Homemade potatoes,  I had country fried steak , my husband had lobster omelette. . Deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Totally great place for a meal to share. Got the kitchen sink for $11.99 and paid the split charge of $0.99  Got a giant piece of pumpkin bread and two plates loaded with potatoes and omelet. Basically enough for two full orders!"}
{"text":"I missed this place! There use to be one much closer to my house but that one closed down. The place is very cosy and vibrates with energy. Not the best place for VEGANs because everything has eggs or dairy, but for vegetarians, pretty darn yummy.  I got the Jolly Green Giant which is an omlete FILLED with veggeis.. but since american style restaurants are always so gigantic in portions i got the baby omlete size. I love that there's such option!!! Their potato spuds are a sinful delight of homemade potato chips. Greasy and salty but SOO yummy!!! Come check it out!"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago with my wife. I ordered the lobster omelette. It was so delicious with the spuds on the side. I loved the fresh baked pumpkin bread as well. Staff was friendly and service was excellent. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Amanda was our waitress and she was excellent.  She even apologized for our patience which was cool,  but we didn't have to wait long for anything. The bf had biscuits and gravy. He liked that a lot. I had the stuffed french toast with blueberries. So good! I recommend this place highly. Quick service for a low price and a home-style feel."}
{"text":"This place was soooo good that in our recent trip to Vegas we kept coming here for breakfast everyday! Home style cooking, food was superb...everything we ordered was delicious! Portion sizes were large!  The omelets are so good and very cheesy, ingredients were fresh and were served with thin and crispy potatoes. The Huevo Rancheros were my favorite. Eggs prepared to your liking and served on top of two crispy corn tortillas with beans, guacamole, and sour cream.  A type of tomatoe sauce on top of the eggs and a couple of crispy chips (wish it came with more.) I ordered a side of pico de gallo...yum! Pancakes, French toast...everything we ordered was great! But.....the best part was the awesome service!!! A+++++  Thank You! Everyone treated us great! We will be coming back :) can't wait!"}
{"text":"We were referred to this delightful place by our garage repair man! And I can I say that this place is the bomb! Their banana nut muffin is served warm and is moist with a nice added nutty flavor thanks to the walnuts.  I ordered the Philly cheesesteak omelet and my niece and I shared it. I'm a pretty big eater and it was hard for her and I to finish! Our waiter was very nice and sweet as well but I forgot her name.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Standard breakfast and lunch menus.  Tables, chairs and booths were probably made in the 1970's and are not in great condition.  Food is good but not spectacular.  This is a place to go if you are there and want to eat.  I wouldn't make a trip to eat here."}
{"text":"Me, my aunts & some of their friends visiting from California went here on the fourth of July this year for a little brunch during our little outing party. Service was quick, but to me, the pancakes I had weren't very good overall. I'll be back, but I should choose something different next time."}
{"text":"My wife and I were heading to the Hoover Dam and stopped here for breakfast.  It is a larger space for a dinner theme, but they make it work.  It was a Sunday morning, and we were seated within 10 minutes.  Great atmosphere and amazing food.  The omelets were big and delicious."}
{"text":"The restaurant is quaint and charming and inviting upon entry. It is easy to miss, buried in the back of a shopping center with a very nondescript entry.  We were seated at a table in the back which is normally reserved for the mayor of Las Vegas! The service was a little bit slow because our server had too many tables - but she more than made up for it with her visits to our table and kindness.  my husband and I ordered omelettes of course, and they were absolutely fantastic. Served hot, generous portions, and the house chips are very tasty! The prices are reasonable, approximately $15 per person all in. We are definitely adding the omelette house to our list of recommended places!"}
{"text":"Greatest Omelet's place to eat in Las vegas.The foood is great and the customer service is excellent..They serve you more food then you expect plus waitresses are very kind and fast service.."}
{"text":"It's a great spot, food was good lots of locals go there. Will recommend for breakfast."}
{"text":"Came in here for brunch on a spontaneous trip to Las Vegas. Yelp did not disappoint. Great food, fair prices, and excellent service! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere for a family breakfast restaurant was nice.  Service from the host to the server was good.  Ordered the chicken fried steak, was probably the best I've had.  Eggs were cooked perfectly, sausage gravy was good, and my toast was as ordered.  Only a few complaint: -Bacon was super thin cut, not my preference.  -Asked for hash browns crispy, ended up with extremely thin cut hard potato chip like potatoes, not edible.   Wish the server had told me that they do not have hash browns.  -The mens bathroom was a smelly mess needing the walls around the urinal cleaned desperately. Glad I used it after my meal."}
{"text":"A very friendly service, fair prices for very good foods. We were 6 and we all said that they are the best omelet and best pancakes we've ever had"}
{"text":"Mmm.  Fresh corned beef hash..  Love love love this place!  They are so nice and warm here.  I believe we had the daughter of the owner serving us and she was sweet.  She also gave full descriptions of the items we were in question about and told us her favorites.    My favorite thing to order here is their corned beef hash - extra crispy.  They make the corned beef from scratch, shred it, add the potatoes, and fry to a crispy brown.  Served with home fries (think, meaty potato chips) and eggs, this can hold you all day long.  One of my go to places when staying in Vegas."}
{"text":"There's a lot of options and the breakfast was some of the best I've had! Service was great and NOTHING could have made this place better! Every thing was cooked and seasoned perfectly. If your ever in Las Vegas take the time to come here!! We ordered the chicken fried steak, pancakes and the biscuits and gravy!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast great service at a great price I always go there for a good experience so far I have not been disappointed it has a very cozy ambiance"}
{"text":"Stopped here while on vacation. Large menu and reasonable prices. Breakfast food was awesome. Going back for lunch now. Would recommend to family's as well."}
{"text":"Diamond in the ruff. .. everything is delicious,  large portions and friendly staff.. try the pumpkin bread best bread ever!!  Been here several times and I am always happy with the food and the service"}
{"text":"Always fresh great food.. huge portions and yummiest pumpkin bread I've ever had!!! Yummmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp.. and it is awesome! No wait.. cheap prices.. great service.. and the lobster benedict was absolutely delicious!! The best benedict ive ever had! Yes.. its off the strip but definitely worth the trip! Our waitress devynn (slim blonde..i think that was her name) was very attentive and friendly! We also ordered an omlette with the spinach onions and feta.. it was average but a large portion (6 eggs). Get the lobster benedict!!!!"}
{"text":"Portions were amazing, great breakfast great service. you can tell this place has a ton of regulars. I kept hearing my waitress refer to people by there names it was a nice place to wake up drink some Coffee and eat a good omelette. My only complaint was I had to send the omelette back to cook a little bit more."}
{"text":"If you are coming here for an omelet, it's 5-star all the way.  Great food and great service in a comfortable atmosphere.  Had the Lobster omelet and LOVED it but couldn't finish it.  Easily a splittable meal for 2 hungry people.  And the banana bread, wow!  (Note:  the banana bread had walnuts in it, so all non-nut eaters beware).   I enjoyed every bite and every moment I spent in there.  An extra \"Thank You\" to the staff of this very enjoyable restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this particular Omelette House, but this place was just as good as other places around town. The service was great and you're given your drinks as soon as you are seated which saves some time. Their banana bread is piping hot and delicious with a side of butter. The homemade potato slices are a bit on the salty side, but that's to be expected. There's a wide variety in of omelettes on the menu with a dish for anyone. Next time I go in I'm definitely trying the lobster omelette (and it's only 12.95!). I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for a low-key place to enjoy a quality meal!"}
{"text":"Great food and the owner was awesome promised he would have us seated in 12 mins or breakfast was on him. Really nice family owned restaurant...My favorite place for breakfast and we were seated quickly..."}
{"text":"This was our second time here. Get an omelet. Huge variety of hearty omelets that are MASSIVE. One easily feeds two people. They are also served with banana or pumpkin bread (or toast) Service is friendly and quick.  It was probably my mistake to order eggs Benedict at an omelet place.   Plus that the english muffin was buttered and grilled on the flattop which gave it a great texture and flaver. Minus for the worst hollandaise i have ever had. It was grainy and missing acidity.   Coffee was what you would expect in a dive.   They get the most points off for the atmosphere though, it is a dive which I normally do not mind (dives can be treasures) but it frankly seemed old and dirty which I do mind."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Las Vegas. You cannot go to Las Vegas and not visit Omelette house! Servings are huge."}
{"text":"Ate brekkie here one morning on a Sunday, the place was insanely crowded but the staff was very efficient and seated us fairly quickly. The food was so tasty!!! I usually like to hit Blueberry Hill when I'm in the area but we thought we would try a new closer to our friends place and we were not disappointed. We only tried this place because of the good Yelp reviews, so thanks Yelpers! You are always spot on. I had the french toast (perfect) and my wonderfully picky fiance had an omelet. Our friends also had omelets and everyone was full and happy after we were done. I will definitely return here, thanks again Yelpers for the recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice place, huge portion, friendly staff. I like the old looking style inside the restaurant. Will try it again when we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place. I wish I had found it much sooner than I did. It has now become a huge part of my lunch rotation list. I love coming here on a rainy day!!  Don't let the outside ruin your perception of the place. It's amazing on the inside. Every wall is decorated with items from days gone by. You could spend hours just looking at that!  Service is great, and the food is even better.  I love the banana nut bread! Warm and melted butter on top. Divine!  My favorite lunch is the 'Sassy Chicken Sandwich' with their famous chips!!! I don't think I ever get anything different for lunchtime.  Will continue to come again and again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service! We never had to ask for coffee or water refills. The food was delicious (I had the lobster Benedict) and the portions are huge. They don't have hash browns but they make up for extra thick homemade chips that they serve with each entree. Oh and the pumpkin bread! Do it, you have to."}
{"text":"Great place to come for breakfast.  I had an omelet with Bacon, Onion, Tomato and cheese.  Arriving at their opening, I was served promptly and service was outstanding.  The portions were huge and the staff is very friendly.  I'll be back when I return to Vegas later in the year.  You wont be disappointed.  Thanks Omelet House !!"}
{"text":"Dined here for breakfast on 4/4/13 with 3 friends. Everyone loved their breakfasts. BIG portions so come hungry or plan on sharing. I had the Stuffed French Toast, cinnamon apple + cream cheese. Added 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon for another 2 bucks. Good value. Good food. Waitress was friendly. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Huge portions at a good price.My son intoduced me to this place for my birthday.Turned out to be a great way to start off the day,when i say huge ...my omlete was the size of a closed Catchers mitt,size and height! and it was delicious. The waitress was nice not always interrupting but near enough to call (perfect) and the establishment was clean.I will return."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place and had to see what it was all about so I decided to head on down. From the outside this place don't look like much and it's even kinda hidden in the back corner of a little strip mall. When you walk inside it kinda looks a little mismatched and it's almost like a maze to get to some of the tables. When I looked at the menu the first thing I noticed was the 40 different omellette's. After seeing other people getting their food and seeing huge the portions were I decided to go with the 38 special (perfect for meat lovers). The food was amazing. Every bite was packed with meat. There wasn't an overkill of cheese. I did have the large portion (6 eggs) but I could have easily done with the small portion (3 eggs). My only complaint was that they serve home fries instead of hash browns. Hash browns are not even an option. Also, you might want to try the pumpkin spice bread, it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas and my friend and I were looking for somewhere spectacular to have breakfast. We were on our way to Hoover damn and decided to Yelp this place and had good reviews. This place has to be the diamond in the rough. The people who work there are amazing. They explained the menu to us and said each omelette has 6 eggs , all I can say is OMG. I highly recommend this place anything and everything on the menu is amazing."}
{"text":"Big portions yummy food, nice staff :)"}
{"text":"In town for sports kids sports events. This place was close by and decided to try it. Food was great and service friendly, clearly a local favorite. I will be back next time. Pastrami burger is wow"}
{"text":"One of the best dive restaurants ever. The portions are generous and the quality is consistent. The corned beef hash is amazing and the service is efficient & friendly. Great value and worth the visit."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and I've been coming for over 20 years.  Nothing fancy here and it's a throwback kind of place but the food is very good (the best corned beef hash ever), the service is quirky but friendly.  There's often a line, not to worry it moves quickly."}
{"text":"When your tired of the casino scene, tired of high prices and just want a quiet off-strip breakfast, then Omelet house is a nice place to go. Its not as over the top as The Peppermill, but it on par with the food. Not sure if I would make an effort to come back out here again, but you won't go wrong trying this place out for yourself."}
{"text":"Great service to start with... Our waitress and staff was friendly and prompt. Food was delicious and we enjoyed the atmosphere. We had a variety of dishes and there was no complaints at our table . Drinks were kept full, no wait to be seated and hot food served."}
{"text":"Great restaurant top breakfast & lunch options I had the eggs Benedict serve with fresh slice potato like chips hot tasty banana bread French toast serve with sausages chicken soup orang juice coffee. This place also has a eating challenge 12 eggs omelette or 3 pound burger must stop by!"}
{"text":"Excellent! First time here kept a pretty safe and went with the ham and cheddar omelette, truly amazing. Hashbrowns or fried like chips and also quite amazing. Great customer service all around, will be back."}
{"text":"First time here on suggestion from a friend. Crazy good food with largest selection of omelets I have ever seen. Huge portions and the pumpkin and banana bread are delicious. Home town feel with top notch service! Prices very reasonable. I will be back..."}
{"text":"This was our lunch stop after visiting Hoover Dam. A typical diner, they offered us a limited menu so they could move us along quickly after the tour ended.  They must be used to tourist coming through on these tour buses and then stiffing them on tips. So, the service was pretty poor. They seated us all together (it was not crowded). The tour guide had called in our orders from the bus, so when we arrived, we presented them with our order cards and they brought our food.  The food was fair. (I had a burger and a coke.) It was kind of tasteless unfortunately.   And, we did leave a tip."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time coming here and it's just as delicious as I remembered. I ordered \"The Californian Omelette\" which has sausage Jack cheese avocado AND it's made with 6 eggs!! Split the omelette if you must, I suggest you do. Comes with their homemade potato chips. Everyone collectively serves you, not just your waitress. It's very \"country kitchen\" feeling inside. I recommend this to anyone in town for a good hearty BIG plate of yummy food. Oh and they have banana nut bread to die for! Can't say enough of this place. So good!"}
{"text":"Best \"driving down the street lookin for a diner\" experience ever. I can't believe I have never been to one of these . I ordered the turkey Benedict and it was so much more than I expected . I called myself ordering light , still left stuffed with a bag of half my plate in my hand. It was fast friendly service and a casual atmosphere . Did I mention the food was bomb? I'll be back. *in my Arnold voice *"}
{"text":"Pumpkin bread is sooo delicious and the banana bread. ...treat YO Self to some carbs!  Can't go wrong with an Omelet and Coffee. The service is always good and will not disappoint. The atmosphere is definitely dated and needs a massive remodel but that would not change the flavor on your taste buds and your sniffer."}
{"text":"Omelet House is a great find off the Vegas Strip for a hearty American breakfast!  We came here on a lightly drizzling Sunday morning and the restaurant was jam packed! After being warned that the wait was an hour, and it was, we finally made it in. The restaurant was very organized with someone always keeping track of the line and making sure that the smaller tables go to the smaller party and the larger tables are saved for the larger party.   All of the omelettes were excellent. They must have used at least 4-5 eggs because each portion was more than sufficient. They come with potatoes that were like crunchy like potato chips but some were thick enough to be soft and greasy and delicious!   They also come with a side of your choosing: toast, English muffin, homemade pumpkin nut bread, banana nut bread, or tortilla. I highly recommend the pumpkin nut bread and banana nut bread! They come out still warm and are super fresh and scrumptious!   Here are some of the omelettes we tried: - \"The Californian\" - sausage, avocado and jack cheese - how can you go wrong? Yes, yes... I am actually from California. This was designed for people like me.  - Rio Grande Surfer - this one had spicy Mexican sausage that went really well with flour tortillas.   The \"Famous Friend Zucchini\" is also really good but GREASY. I highly recommend it but make sure you have the stomach for it. We only got 1/2 portion to share among 6 people and I think that was sufficient for all of us to get a bite and enjoy it. Any more than that and I think our stomach would have a hard time handling it.   For 6 people, the bill came out to be less than $10 per person (keep in mind some of us only order salad and soup). For the amount of food we received, this was valued packed! Sure the plates did not come out in fancy decoration as one would expect from restaurants on the Strip, but this was as good as it gets at an all American diner.   Note:  *$0.95 charge for splitting plates *omelette in smaller portions for $1 off. *parties of 8+ get a 15% gratuity add on.  The parking was a bit tough given how crowded it was. I overheard some people saying to each other that they were going to go to another branch. There are 3 locations listed on the menu but since I'm not local, I have no idea how close they are from each other.  Omelet House is an amazing American diner off Las Vegas Strip that is value packed and affordable!"}
{"text":"The omelet house has a vast majority of omelettes, different types of omelettes. I ordered an omlete  with bacon, onions, and tomato. I got a small omelette which consist of 3 eggs instead of 6 and it came with potato chip style potatoes. I believe it is their specialty. Our breakfast also came with banana nut bread which was delicious, it was warm and it came with butter. The servers were very friendly and we ordered and got our meal rght away."}
{"text":"amazing portions!!! delicious food! The staff is excellant!  We normally stop here on the way back home.  Probably where the locals eat.  It's always crowded when we go.  Have yet to be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Always a good experience here.  Food keeps bringing me back. Nice break from the busy casino environment."}
{"text":"Omelets use 6 eggs. If you want a 3 egg one, they'll take 99 cents off.  As a result, it feels like I'm overpaying if I get the 3 egg version. Many omelet choices, but many of them are very similar.  There is no reasonably priced option to build your own omelet. It would be great to have a 3 egg build your own omelet with 3 or 4 add ins included that was similar in price to their other options.  Aside from that though, the decor is kitschy. There are a few sections with old, curled post it note prices on some garage sale collectibles. In other areas are old garage sale style toys hanging around. Not in a tasteful display, but stuck on the little ledge between booths. Think that creepy baby doll from some scary movie. It's watching you eat!  I think the whole place would be cleaner feeling if they got rid of all the ceramic collectibles and old garage sale toys and repainted."}
{"text":"i woke up at the crack of dawn on my second day in vegas. the bff and i were still running on miami time. he asked me what i wanted to do and i said i'd love to have a big breakfast at a little dive by the side of the road somewhere in the desert. having been to vegas several times already, he knew just where to take me. the omelet house is clean and cozy and the wait staff are darlings. i ordered the popeye (spinach, mushroom and swiss) and asked the waitress if she could add hollandaise (i know, fat attack, shutup). she cheerfully obliged and before we knew it, our orders were brought out. the omelet comes with a heap of freshly fried, seasoned potato chips and one of several bread sides. i wisely ordered the banana bread, which was an enormous, piping hot slab of moist, fragrant bread with a little cup of butter. obviously i HOUSED that shit - well, half of it - and took the rest to go. omelet house will always hold a special place in my heart as where we ate before we drove half an hour down the road to see the hoover dam."}
{"text":"Just the food was cold service was bad only one server so i cant blame the her too muck get it together or dont serve dinner but i will say breakfast  is good"}
{"text":"Although the food was delicious the owner is a complete jerk.  My husband was speaking with the manager who proceeded to walk away, before my husband was still talking. I do not care how good the food is, customer service should be #1 and if it is not...then you have issues."}
{"text":"Love the omelet house. The first time my husband and I went, it happened to be my birthday, and we were on the hunt for a brunch spot to start the day. It's close to our house, and I love all things breakfast food, so it won. Turns out, if it's your birthday, you get your meal free! (not drinks, and not \"extras\", but the first time they let me add on to my omelet for free anyway - can't hurt to ask). Now it's our birthday tradition :)  I tend to get either the lobster omelet or the lobster eggs benedict - I just love those feisty crustaceans. The portions are definitely huge, but they make great leftovers, so what's the big deal? Both lobster meals are very heavy on the lobster - giant chunks. If I'm feeling saucy, I add bacon and shrimp to go with the included avocados :)   The potatoes are kinda homemade chip style - not always awesome warmed up later, but nicely seasoned. And the pumpkin bread is worth getting an extra side."}
{"text":"The chicken fried steak with gravy  was delicious and the pumpkin bread was great to start off breakfast."}
{"text":"Where do I start...If your looking for white table cloths, dim lighting and soft music, this ain't the place. It's high speed, food slinging, waitress slapping you on the back, gastro-bliss. It's old school OMG how did you fit all of that on a plate.   Expect a wait on the weekends, but trust me it's worth it. The place looks a little wore down, but that's part of its charm, plus I think Henderson would riot if they closed to remodel.   The omelet's are about 6 eggs and are stuffed with just about anything you can think of. The spuds are seasoned sliced potatoes and portions are on the large side.   Coffee is fresh and fast to be filled. I haven't experienced lunch there yet but the burgers look great and so does the fried zucchini. I can see why they been voted the best breakfast in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in Las Vegas /Henderson. Great big heart proportions are sure to leave you satisfied and in a nice food coma."}
{"text":"Not much I can say about this place, seems to have it together service-wise. The salad bar placement in  the middle of the restaurant is awkward especially with the transition to the serving area is right there, but who cares about that right?   Ordered the chili verde scramble, after taking time to study a menu with LOTS of options. The food came out quick, and they have a hearty portion. Was decent, left plenty to take home. The green sauce seemed canned,so it took away from the food.  Will be back to try some of the other dishes, just too many to fit in one setting."}
{"text":"nothing bad you can say about this place the food is tops the service is great and the coffee never stops coming if you try it you will love it"}
{"text":"Didn't wait long , the food was really great they have baby omelettes that are still a lot of food ! The potatoes were good but some were hard like chips , the waiter took a while to take our order and got my order wrong but the food was still great . I will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!   Service: 5/5. They were busy but service was fast and efficient. Our server, Jose, was very nice.  Food: 5/5. I love the lobster fest omelette, full of lobster and avocados. Everything was so tasty including the French toast, banana bread, and wheat toast!  Recommend: Yes! I will definitely come back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"serious breakfast with a local crowd.  you won't leave hungry but you might have some indigestion"}
{"text":"2nd time this week I had breakfast here. Servers, Amanda and Kathy were great! All of the other staff was very attentive. Food was really good and came out quick."}
{"text":"Consistently Good. Great - Friendly Service. My favorite breakfast place in town. The best corned beef hash and the waffles are delicious. Generous portions, Me and the wife usually split meals and still leave stuffed.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat had the mushroom burger, waiters were really friendly and the food was fast. Cool atmosphere, mellow vibe loved it!."}
{"text":"Came here at about 12:30pm for breakfast. Place was relatively packed but we signed in as a party of 3. We only waited about 8 minutes to get seated. They have about 38 different combinations of omelets. All in all great food and good experience"}
{"text":"Let's break this down...  - full parking lot ...check - polite news paper kid opened the door for us...check - old timey grandma's house vibe...check - quick to be seated...check - coffee cup stayed full the entire time...check - REAL butter served with my banana bread...check again  This place was awesome! The Spartacus with egg whites is definitely the way to go. Large pieces of asparagus, thick cut mushrooms, and fluffy egg whites. I dig this dish. The had splenda for the coffee on the table so I didn't have to ask anyone to travel to the back of the kitchen for any. I was pleasantly surprised by the great service. Thanks yelp for another grade A experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try something new for breakfast and we always drive past this place and wanted to try it out. I wish we would of just gone with what we know and went to egg works. First, there was a bowl sitting on our table the wasn't even clean. Second, our server Shannon I believe her name was didn't even come to our table until we were already there for 10 minutes then when she finally got there she rushed us ordering even though the restaurant wasn't even busy to the point where I wasn't even able to order exactly how I wanted it. She was so RUDE. Then we tried to grab her attention because we wanted to order the \"huge ice mocha\" first she ignored us, then she reluctantly paid attention to us. Then she didn't even bring it, she got one of the other girls to bring it out AND SHE TOOK IT TO THE WRONG TABLE. At least this girl was sweet. Once we got it, it wasn't huge, it was a regular sized chocolate milk at best. After that, we over heard a dispute between Shannon and another guest there. The guest was complaining about her taking too long, which is true, then Shannon ARGUED with the guest and said that she was wrong and then walked away.  Overall, the food was just alright and I would NEVER recommended it to anyone. Never going there again."}
{"text":"off the beaten path but worth the drive. very good, clean, reasonable and better than eating on the strip. worth a return visit!!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been here the last two times I've gone out to Vegas and there breakfast is incredibly delicious! I've ordered the Lobster Benedict both times, super yummy, I've tried their biscuits and gravy also awesome, and the dishes my boyfriend and friends have ordered were great too.  There's a reason there's a long wait on weekends, but it's definitely worth it!  The waitresses were super friendly as well and always kept our coffees and waters filled. Our food came out fast.  Will always stop here every"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and when I read the high rating I knew I had to try it. I was not disappointed! This just made top of the list as one of my favorite breakfast spots! The food is exceptional and the atmosphere has that cozy diner feel. I had the Liberty Bell which was amazing in both taste and quality. It's rare to find that \"home cooked\" quality these days. Kathy was our serve and she did an excellent job of making sure we were take  care of. I am definitely coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Although we didn't have breakfast here, (a definite, \"mark this down for the next trip to Vegas!\")  we did have lunch, which was part of the  Comedy on Deck Tour Company's Hoover Dam Untimate Tour. Jason, our tour guide, said that Omelet House was the best, and indeed it was! Serving all 43+ of us in a timely, organized manner, exactly what we ordered, was a feat of amazing teamwork from Jason's communication, to the delivery of our drinks and meals. Very impressive! We were able to choose from several selections and got the recommended hamburger and enchiladas. Every bite of my hamburger was filled with juicy, tasty sensations of med/done quality grilled hamburger, lettuce, thousand island dressing, tomato slice on homemade delicious bun served with homestyle french fries. The cheesey/meat enchilada was served with red rice, and was devoured fast-a testament to its tasty goodness!  Not only is the food exceptional, the atmosphere here at the Omelet House, takes you back to the 50's with strategicly posted pictures and \"artifacts\" from the beginnings of Las Vegas but even more noteworthy, is the personnel-so professional, courteous, efficient and friendly; really felt \"at home\" from the moment we walked into the Omelet House!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!!! Definitely what we needed to eat today to start our day. We didn't have to wait for long and just as soon as we walked in we knew it was going to be good. The menu gives you so many options for omelettes ( obvious, the name of the restaurant). I ordered the French toast special with turkey sausage instead of bacon, and I must say it was the best.  I suggest this place for a good comfort breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, the banana nut bread is amazing, I always like to o scramble my omelette, and they are really good at that, great ambiance as well."}
{"text":"My second visit today and the French toast special with bacon and scrambled eggs was the most perfect breakfast! I love how friendly the staff is and how fast and yummy the food arrives. Another A++!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident when I first moved to this side of town and I took a wrong turn. So glad we did. It's so cute and the food is great! Apparently it is pretty popular, there is always a good amount of people on there. The service was faster than we expected especially for it being so busy the day we went. The prices are great for their portions-which are huge! If it was not so crowded on the weekends we would make it over there more often but luckily they have takeout too which we are happy with as well!"}
{"text":"Tough to find and well worth it once your in. Fresh hot pumpkin or banana bread, six or three egg omelettes. (Almost 40 selections). Delicious, priced well and kitschy, everything you need for a great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Had jolly green giant omelet and added bacon, pastrami sandwich, chili with garlic bread, and pumpkin bread. Our server, JILLLLLL, was effing fantastic. She recommended stuff to us since it was our first time. The pumpkin bread was warm and tasted like Fall. Chili was delicious. We got it with cheese and onions. The garlic bread was crispy and chewy with one side having caramelized cheese. It was PERFECT. The omelet was delicious and ginormous. I took 80% of it home because we ordered so much food. The boyfriend said the pastrami sandwich was delicious and came out piping hot. First time here and it was super freaking awesome.   Don't be put off by the exterior condition of the place. I'm not going to lie.... The interior could use a little revamping. It essentially looks like how I would imagine grandmas house with knick knacks that she's collected over the years. It's pretty neat and the restaurant is a lot bigger than I expected it to be. Anyways will definitely try to get my boyfriend to take me here again!!!!!"}
{"text":"HUGE portions, tasty, not the best quality cheeses used in the omelets, but huge.  Mine was a little dry, (spinach, mushroom, jack) but hubbies had chorizo and was more moist.  The banana nut bread was wonderful and beats toast anyday.  Side of bacon cooked just right.  Only downside it's a little spendy.  About $30.00 with tip for two."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. The best thing about this place is the service and the warm bread they bring out with the food. The potato spuds were decent nothing special. It has huge portions and its relatively cheap so if you're looking for a huge breakfast come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this little breakfast joint. Every server makes you feel at home. We always leave with fully bellies and leftovers. I love that you can get some pumpkin or banana nut bread with your breakfast entree... it's adds the perfect amount of sweet to a hearty omelette. My favorite part is that I can bring my 2 year old and not have to worry about disturbing others because it's a very family friendly (and fairly noisy) restaurant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I needed to run some errands around town and wanted to hit a breakfast place.  I was in the area and checked Yelp for a tasty spot.  I had heard of this place before but put it in the back of my head.  I saw that there were about 50+ review and the place was getting an average 4 1/2 starts, which never really happens. I was excited to finally eat here.  Now, I don't ever really give 5 stars.  In fact the only way to earn that 5th star from is to provide exceptional service.  This place won it hands down.  Let me take a minute to explain before I get the food.    We arrived and there was a wait but not that long.  Sometimes I don't mind a short wait because most of the time the food is worth it.  We were seated in a booth by a tall guy in a black shirt.  He took the drink orders and then our waitress came a few minutes later.  I love it when place have people who make sure drinks are filled.  The wait is busy enough.  We have our girls with us.  My youngest is still little.  show we had the car seat in the booth.  When we got our food we asked for a seat so she could sit in it.  One of the employees said that we couldn't put a seat where were seated.  We said it's ok and we understand.  The gentlemen that sat us down saw my wife trying to eat and hold the baby and asked if we need the seat.  We said that we couldn't put it there.  He look at us and said \"Why not?\"  You need and then put the seat down.  I thought that was awesome!    One thing I can say about the food is PORTION! Wow, do you get a pile of food here.  I ordered the .38 special omelet.  It had all the meats in it.  My Wife ordered the egg scramble.  The food was tasty.  The potatoes were amazing.  They also have a giant 12 egg omelet you can eat if you want to bring out your inner \"Man Vs. Food.\"  I also noticed they have a 3lb giant hamburger you eat too!  If you are ever in old Henderson by the boulder highway you have to check this place out! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've now been to this restaurant twice - both during short, quick visits to Las Vegas. The first time, we stopped at here because my parents practically demanded that I give it a try! We stopped in on our way out of town for both visits, and it really was some of the best food and service for both, too.  The first time I ate here, I ordered corned beef hash, which came with eggs and potatoes if I remember correctly, and I got one of their sweet baked breads instead of toast. DELICIOUS! I also ordered a side of pancakes and split them with one of the people I was with - actually, come to think of it, I remember giving him a decent sized portion of all of my food. They don't skimp on things, let me tell you!  The second time I ate at this delicious restaurant, I tried the Eggs Benedict Lobster - SO WONDERFUL! The hollandaise isn't too rich, which I really appreciated. I rarely every enjoy hollandaise, unless I've made it myself - theirs complimented the flavor of the lobster. The eggs were done perfectly, the potatoes were delicious, and there were actual chunks of lobster. I really enjoyed my breakfast.  Speaking specifically about the second visit, myself, my partner, and our best friend were traveling. We ate at NUMEROUS places during our 4-day stay in Vegas (even a restaurant that ended up having a film crew there from the travel channel WHILE we were dining there!), and I must say, the service here blew every other place out of the water. Before eating here, we were all talking amongst ourselves about how absolutely horrendous all of our customer service experiences had been at almost every single place we'd dined at. Say we ate at 8 places - only two of them were nice, and one of those two was better than nice (guess what - it was Omelet House).  Also, it should be noted that both times we stopped in, they were pretty busy - and yet we were sat pretty much immediately.  If we go to Las Vegas again, this place will be on our breakfast list, for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go and get omelette the best on what they have is the kitchen sink it's humongous most people won't finish it I always do but it's fantastic and I drink tons of their orange juice and the waiters are always nice in the food's always hot and tastes very fresh love going here"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our Lyft driver, and it did not disappoint. Delicious breakfast, friendly service, and the coffee just kept coming. Great hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My daughter and me have a wonderful experience every time we go. Plus we leave stuffed and happy...  Fred has got to be the best and friendliest person I know. Thanks for bringing this restaurant near me I will continue to go for a long time!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, so much history here! Ms. Irene is so sweet and the owner is always here helping customers and staff. I over heard the owner thanking one of his staff members that stayed late the other day and wanted to let her know how much he appreciated her hard work!"}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favorite breakfast place. Every time I come to Vegas I make it a point to visit.   The variety and the omelets themselves are gigantic. They're made with 6 eggs for the \"large\" and 3 eggs for the \"baby.\" Personally, I think it's more bang for your buck to get the large as the price difference is only about a dollar.   I've tried a variety of omelets and each time it was delicious. My faves are the Rio Grande Surfer and the Cowboy Special. The distribution of ingredients throughout the omelets is a little off sometimes so don't think they skimped out on you when you make that first cut!  Before Omelet House I was never a huge fan of omelets. Now, I get excited whenever I see the sign. A tip: definitely get either the banana nut bread or pumpkin nut bread instead of the toast. It's no extra cost and is half the reason I love this place.  The service here is also impeccable. The waitresses are always friendly and quick to refill drinks/take your order. They even take the time to assure you your food is quick on the way if you've been waiting a few minutes."}
{"text":"I have no idea what I was thinking ordering oatmeal AND splitting \"The Kitchen Sink\" with Don. That was just way too much food to handle. For those of you that don't know. \"The Kitchen Sink\" pretty much has everything in it. I can't even tell you what the ingredients are because the description just says. \"For adventurers only, this one really has it all.\" It's also the only omelet on the menu that comes in a size large and you can't get it in any other size.   My oatmeal came out right away. It was in a regular size bowl with raisins, brown sugar, butter, and cream on the side. I mixed everything in and started chowing down. To be honest, this was the first time I've ever ordered oatmeal anywhere. I normally just eat oatmeal at home and feel like it's overpriced at restaurants, but I was craving it and it was only $2.99 (a great value for the amount you get). The texture was nice. It wasn't too thick, too watery, or too grainy, just right. I ate about half of it when the omelet came out. It was seriously huge and literally had EVERYTHING in it. It doesn't say it on the menu, but Mamie P. stated down below that it's made with SIX eggs. No wonder it's giant. I saw carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, chili, hotdogs, cheese, bacon, ham, turkey, onions, broccoli...I'm guessing everything that's listed as ingredients for all the other omelets is in this omelet. It also come with spuds on the side and you choice of carbs, e.g. tortillas, toast, English muffin, pumpkin bread, or banana nut bread. We went with the banana nut, which was delicious and fresh. The spuds look like potato chips, but they're thicker and soft. Don is a potato freak, so he enjoyed them. The omelet was just a little too much for me, especially after eating half of my oatmeal. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty tasty with the mixture of all the meats and veggies, but I was just too full to enjoy it. If we ONLY ordered the omelet, I think I would've really liked it. Don enjoyed the amount of mushrooms it had in it and the Filipino in him really loved the hotdogs as well. I really suggest you only get \"The Kitchen Sink\" if you're splitting it between at least two people and that's all you're ordering. You should also be fine with the amount of random ingredients that are in it. It's kind of like an \"ghetto\" omelet in which everything is just thrown into.   All in all, I like this place. The menu is very broad, they have about 40 or so omelets, and the service is fast and friendly. I noticed there were a lot of regulars when I went, so it almost felt like having breakfast at someone's house (not in an awkward way). When we were walking out I even noticed a cookie jar that was just like the cookie jar my mom had in our kitchen when I was little (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s4JjYgLO5dGUUV9Op4YBrw/l.jpg). It was literally the same exact one. I didn't say anything, but ten seconds later, Don said, \"Dude, that's the same cookie jar my mom had when I was little.\" So we learned that we had something in common as kids. Next time, I'll stick to a smaller omelet though, or maybe stuffed French toast and definitely another piece of their banana nut bread ;)"}
{"text":"Warm and welcoming staff. Went there with my son after a weekend get away. And this was a great end to a great trip. Food portions are good size I probably could have shared my omelet with another adult."}
{"text":"I love there omlet it's so big and good I love going there every chance I get there a lil high tho"}
{"text":"I second EVERYTHING from \"Melissa D\"....   My husband & I decided to stop in for one last taste of Vegas before we return to the real world after our weekend hiatus. And BOY! Was it a good one!! We were seated right away and greeted warmly by our waitress. After taking our drink order she gladly gave us more time as she could tell we were in awe of the menu options! OMELETS ANY WAY YOU CAN THINK OF!! :) I ordered a single pancake with blueberries and he ordered an omelet (the Juan one, add bacon) I tried his and it was AMAZING! I especially liked the \"house potatoes\", I could've eaten a plateful alone! :) My pancake was okay, personally the topping was a bit more like syrupy pie filling and a little on the sweet side but it was more than enough and I enjoyed it!  The service was just as great! The employees were friendly and even though very busy they all seemed to be in sync & working together! Our cups were refilled and plates cleared promptly! The atmosphere was the warm and laid back, much like the \"mom & pop\" breakfast houses at home.   bottom line, it was a great ending to our perfect weekend and we will MOST DEFINITELY be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow.. On our way to Hoover dam this morning we wanted to get some breakfast. A simple search on Yelp and we found this gem of a place! From service to food quality to taste, it was all amazing!! I ordered an omelette with cheese and the wife ordered the waffle special. Both the plates were so delicious. Moreover, the portion sizes are ginormous, we barely ate half the omelette! In all, it was a great tasting quality breakfast. Highly recommend the Omelette House!"}
{"text":"A home run!! Wow.. We were on the way to hoover dam and needed to find breakfast. We yelped and found this gem of a place in Henderson! I ordered an omelette with sausage and the wife ordered Belgium waffles. Both the plates were huge and so tasty. The service was fast and nice. We were so happy to find such a nice place and the flavors exceeded our expectations down right. We highly recommend the Omelette House and will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh delicious. Every time we come to OH, I say I'm going to eat something different, but alas, it never happens. There are three OH, one down the street from the other. The original is the one we've gone to the most, but the new location has mimosas and beer. Simple things my friends, simple things, especially in the morning after a very, very long night.  The lobster omelet is phenomenal. Real lobster, avocado and Jack cheese. I am particular about my omelets and how they're constructed (yes, omelet snobbery exists), and OH puts a ton of lobster, avocado and cheese stuffed into the omelet instead of sitting on top of the omelet doing nothing. I strongly dislike lazy omelet makers that put main ingredients (other than chili, chile verde, etc)on top of the omelet only instead of inside the omelet, so OH does everything right. There is nothing like cutting into the baby Lobster Fest omelet (which is still massively large)and getting a supple chunk of lobster, cheese and avocado in every bite. The homemade chips that come with the omelet have a great seasoning on them that makes it easy to devour them in one foul swoop.   My fiance has tried several different dishes. So far, his favorite dish is the lobster eggs benedict. I don't know how they make their hollandaise sauce, and I don't know if I want to. There are some high caloric foods that I don't need to think about when licking the plate. Picture a beautiful piece of lobster resting under a perfectly poached egg drowned in hollandaise sauce. Somewhere on the plate is an english muffin, but that's not as important as what's rocking out on top of the muffin. Some people don't want their EB drowned in hollandaise, so if that's you, ask for it on the side. I may or may not have dipped some of my chips in said hollandaise sauce just to ensure my arteries were clogged before working out later that day.  Advice: Get the baby omelet. They say it is a baby size, but the baby size is large enough still for an ogre baby, because its still hefty and fills up 75% of the people who eat it. If you're getting an omelet topped with chili or chile verde (which is pretty delicious, but doesn't have enough kick like I'm used to with chile verde), definitely go for the smaller size or you'll be hurting in the restroom for many hours following your meal. Come on. That many eggs can rarely do a body good. Also, get the banana bread. Oh dear God. Piping hot homemade banana bread smothered in real butter (margarine is a crime against the world)not only has one of the most intoxicating smells, but according to my fiance the taste of it is fantastic."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place for breakfast! We come to this location a lot. The service  is always awesome and so is the food. We haven't tried the lunch or dinner, so that's something to try one night! If it is your first time visiting, you have to try any dish with the spuds and their warm banana nut bread. I always get the meat lovers skillet."}
{"text":"FOOD Ginormous portion sizes that can be shared (for a fee). I ordered the \"Plymouth Rock\" Omelet ($8.89), and was told afterwards that it's made out of 6 eggs!!! Ingredients also included turkey, guacamole and Jack cheese. I thought it could have been seasoned better, but I wonder if this is on purpose: catering to an elderly crowd perhaps. On the side was some freshly fried potato chips and moist banana bread. Overall, I was satisfied with the food.  AMBIANCE A local breakfast spot, and certainly seemed popular. The interior felt cramped in some aisles. The decor was primarily decked in wood, as well as the walls, booths and tables. It really feels like an old-fashioned diner from a long time ago.  SERVICE Most of the waiting staff was pleasant enough. Managed to get a refill for my soda. The main reason for the rating was this: after just eating half of the omelet, and as we were preparing to pay the check, our grandmotherly waitress cleared the table... At first I thought she was going to take it back to box it to go... Nope. And it wasn't just my order that was thrown out. My girlfriend's dish as well. Oddly enough, she didn't take away the banana bread.  There are men and women's restrooms.  I would have been more favorable with my review, but not being able to take the majority of the food I paid for, left me on a sour note. If you do come here, be sure to watch your food."}
{"text":"Food was good but nothing amazing. Huge omelets. Potatoes are yummy in ranch, which is weird for breakfast but so good."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, huge portions and a great place to go whit large groups! When ordering an omelette... SPLIT IT!!!  We had the cowboy omelette with chili and cheese and it was delicious.  Served with home made potato chips that are crispy and YUMMY!   When splitting  a meal there is a $1 charge... Well worth it!  One person will not finish it!   I will always come back here while in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very good find in Vegas off the strip. It was not busy as we came on a weekday. I had the porky pig baby omelet with spuds and toast. The omelet was delicious and while I was at first skeptical of the spuds, they were a great little addition. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Of course ive been relying on yelp for restaurant navigation and everyone wanted breakfast. Our hostess was such a sweetie!  She had a great sense of humor.   And our waiter was fun and on top of things. Our bill was bout $70 and we left a $20 tip because all of us liked him. Our food was really good. With our breakfast, we had these potato chip style potatoes w/seasonings. Yum! A must try is their homemade pumpkin bread...they serve it warm and give u butter. Even my picky mom enjoyed it!  She stole some of mine and then changed her order to pumpkin bread.  There are a million omelet choices (as if you couldnt guess that by the restaurant name)."}
{"text":"This place had the Best stuffed blueberry french toast I have ever eaten I knew their omelets were delicious and after trying the stuffed french toast I know everything thing on their menu is terrific if you've never treated yourself to the Omelet House you have no idea what your missing and very reasonable also I have been going there for over 20 years and will continue for 20 more God willing"}
{"text":"Ordered the Eggs Flourintine Benedect with a single slice of french toast. It was very delicious. No disappearing spinach, they were very generous. The rest of the crew ordered omelets and waffles. Portions are very big, so bring your appetite. Friend of mine had the banana bread that came with his meal. That alone tasted amazing. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Had an omelet, of course. It was big and cheesy and delicious. Highly recommend the coffee and the banana bread too."}
{"text":"Not too shabby.  The decor in this place is hilarious...betty boop figurines, roosters, a picture of a lobster, vending machine with bounce balls and a love-o-meter machine?!?!  Little something for everyone here.  If you like chatchke's this is the place for you!  The old timers definitely like this place...cheap food and Large portions.  I had an egg white omelet with cheese, broccoli and white chicken meat.  The thing was huge, I ate about 1/4 of it.  Not a bad place of breakfast.  Parking can be a bit of an issue but it's not impossible."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and service. The decor is dated but you're not there for the knock knacks. The omelets are HUGE made from six eggs. You can opt for a three egg \"baby\" omelet. I loved the Californian with avocado, jack cheese, and sausage. I exchanged the regular sausage for chorizo. Yum! Comes with amazing potatoes and your choice of homemade breads.   My mom got the full stack of pancakes. They were fluffy, tasty, and monstrous. You may want to get a smaller portions.   Service is very good and friendly. If you like lots of cafe coffee come here because they will try to refill it every minute.   The only disappointment was the biscuits and gravy, but my husband is a snob about those since he is from rural Virginia.   You pay your bill up front. Go in with your fat pants on, and leave with plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"If we hadn't come here with locals, I  may not have found this place for myself.   It's entrance it tucked way up back in a strip mall. It's the kind of place I like, though. you wind around down different corridors, into and out of small dining space. You can tell that they just kept expanding into the neighboring retail spaces. Oh, and 1982 called and they want there fake flower displays back.  The Omelet House would have gotten five stars, but our server was a little crazed about taking our order within two minutes of sitting down. Seriously, she first came to take orders at about :45 seconds. When we said we needed another minute, sh must have taken us too literally, because she came back about :60 second later. Cripes, girl, it's my first time here and you've got four pages to look through.  *EGGS BENEDICT ALERT*  Really, really good eggs bene!  Probably one of the top five Hollandaise sauces I've had, flavorful, little tangy, just the right amount.   And those taters!  I got to have potato chips for breakfast and not feel bad!"}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM! everytime. love that country scrambler. best ham in town. i always do takeout tho cuz its always crowded."}
{"text":"This is probably the best service I've had from a manager!!!!! Kevin was phenomenal!! It's not very often you see a manager helping the the people they manage. Not only was Kevin seating tables, he was also taking drink orders and doing table visits. This all with a warm and welcoming tone. At last a place you can come to and know you will receive a great experience."}
{"text":"Everything here is pretty yummy. Omelette's are pricey but you can feed 2 3 people with one. Spuds are amzing and the banana bread is so.yummy!"}
{"text":"Warning all breakfasts come with toast, bread, or English muffin on the side accept egg's Benedict because I guess egg's Benedict doesn't count as breakfast... However the menu has it listed under:  \"Each Breakfast is prepared with only Farm-Fresh Eggs, Spuds, and your choice of Toast, English Muffin, Homemade Pumpkin Nut Bread, Banana Nut Bread, or Tortillas.\"  After pointing that out I was told by one person it already came with English muffins (which made no sense as English muffin is part of the eggs Benedict not as a side). Another one said that it's not part of the deal because it's something separate(I guess it's not considered breakfast? And another agreed with me, but no bread anyways. I tried to make a comparison saying \"It would be like getting an omelette with bacon in it an because the omelette has bacon in it you don't get it on the side.\" To which the lady said \"We don't have omelettes with bacon\"... I used to love this place an highly recommended it an would take visitors to it and recommend it to passengers(I'm a Uber/Lyft driver) when asked about a good locals place to eat, but after this experience I don't foresee that happening."}
{"text":"Meh.... Green giant omelet (smaller portion) was watery and really had no flavor. Potatoes were also meh, mostly soft and very few had crunch around the edges.  Banana bread was delicious.  First came here in 2011, but don't remember it being this horrible. Much a disappoint. Won't return.  Staff is very nice."}
{"text":"This is The Place you have been looking for and couldn't find for years. This hole-in-the-wall is an old time throwback to happier times with just plain good old grub that don't cost an arm & a leg. Super omelets with a menu selection that reads like a book. The home fries are different and yet very good, so is the homemade corned beef hash. Come hungry."}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast joint in Las Vegas.   Started with pumpkin bread served piping hot with a side of real butter. It was kinda wrong to put butter on the cake-like bread, but it was sooo melty delicious.   And since I was on vacation and calories don't count on vacation, right? I ordered blueberry stuffed french toast which was DIVINE. Husband ordered a ham and cheese omelet which was the size of a baby.   The food here kept us happy and full on through dinner."}
{"text":"Great food with huge portions. Service was excellent. The employees were kind. If you're in Vegas I'd definitely take your family here for breakfast"}
{"text":"So I tried this place a long time ago when they first opened and it was very ehh, cold, overcooked food but my dad was craving breakfast so we decided to give them a try since it's near my parent's house. What a complete turnover! I got the Lobster Benedict, and my dad got the Chicken Fried Steak and both were loaded with flavor. It's funny because I really don't like omelets but even though they have a bunch of omelet options they also have a lot of other choices for breakfast as well as sandwiches and hamburgers! So if you've never been here, there they don't have hashbrowns, they have spuds. Basically homemade thick potato chips. I was kind of iffy about these but our server told us we could have them soft so they're closer to the textures of potatoes in potato gratin or we could have them crispy. My dad and I went with the soft spuds and they were just as good as hashbrowns in my opinion. Now I was really surprised with my Lobster Benedict. There was probably about  5 inch thick pieces of lobster on each english muffin! (came with two) And it was really fresh tasting as well! The Hollandaise sauce was also really creamy and seasoned well. Yum! I had to steal a bite of my dad's Chicken Fried Steak and it was pretty good as well. I really liked their sausage gravy but their Fried Steak made me sad when some of the breading slid off but the flavor made up for it.  As for service, our server was really friendly and made sure our waters were kept full. Their hours are really good as well open everyday from 7am-3pm. Can't wait to come again and maybe try their Pumpkin Bread I've been hearing a lot about as well as Stuffed French Toast."}
{"text":"TWO WORDS!! Green Chile!!   Oh my word, it's been years since I've been here and still one of the best in town! Suzette was a pleasant and cheerful server getting us water immediately and saving us from the sweltering heat outside!   My green Chile omelette was Heaven and just what I was craving!   Only wishing that they had a bread today that was Nut free. Banana and Pumpkin bread looked great but not for my nut allergy!   Still the omelets are what will be calling us back soon!"}
{"text":"Looked up a local breakfast spot on yelp and this place came up. My boyfriend and I split the mile high omelette. It was huge! We also split a pancake. Everything tasted great and the staff was friendly. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We were visiting LV and used yelp to find a breakfast place.  Great place, the banana nut bread is the best OMG so good!  Very friendly staff and the homestyle decor makes you feel right at home.  The portions are big you can share and still get full.  A worthwhile stop we'll be back for sure. *it's tucked in the back of stripmall*"}
{"text":"This is an absolutely amazing place to go for breakfast! I honestly have had a very difficult time finding a place that served delicious hollondaise sauce, and this place not only made that possible but exceeded my expectations! Their menu is amazing and everything sounds so delicious! Their portions are huge though, so come with an appetite lol! But wow, the service was so friendly and hospitable even though they were packed! I had Kris as my server and she was an absolute delight. I ordered the eggs Benedict lobster and wow, I was BLOWN away. I was not expecting to get SUCH a great dish that was seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly and just so beyond anything I would have imagined. I'm definitely coming back and I'm bringing every single person I know here! What a great experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, delicious, and very affordable! Tried the country Benny and my boyfriend had the chorizo omelette, both were amazing! You also have to try the banana nut bread!"}
{"text":"We had some time to kill while getting our windows tinted, this place popped up on my map, it was a nice little spot, the hot chocolate was yummy and the french toast was great! I had Strawberries on the side and it was perfect, my honey got an egg skillet sort of thing with this potato chips type potatoes. We had a good breakfast and our waitress was very sweet and attentive, forgot to ask her name, but she was a younger brunette with an accent, we would definitely visit again when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Could hardly wait to get off the Vegas Strip and its blas√© cafes and buffets. The Omelet House has our business for sure. Could order a single meal and it would leave two people comfortably full with great food. I got the ham and cheese and my wife got a veggie omelet, that's why we don't share, and it was great, and did I mention big.  Their \"spuds\" are to die for. A thick homemade potato chip is the best way to describe them. Deep fried at the perfect temperature. They could be baked they were that good.   Friendly staff, comfy seating. Very good place."}
{"text":"Went here with the BF and his nephew and niece (6-yr-old twins), and I really enjoyed it!  The food was great!  I had a stuffed, french toast (with apples and cream cheese).  The BF had omelet, potato chips, and french toast.  The kids shared one pancake and had soda pop.  My french toast was delicious, and I tried some of the BF's banana bread (that came with the omelet), and it was good.  Our bill was $32 (without tip).  The wait wasn't that long, and the service was great.  The decor was really homey too.  There was also a lady that came around to each table to see if the kids wanted balloons.  Our table said yes, and she proceeded to make a dog and a bunny for the kids.  I tipped her $5 for the balloons.    The only reason I deducted a star was because I would have liked for them to have coloring books and crayons for the kids.  I also would have liked to see a little more interaction with the kids as well.  But overall, great place, and I would go here again!"}
{"text":"Had to wait because we came on a Saturday morning, but all was good once we were seated. I didn't like sitting at the bar because the seats are a bit too close together, I even bumped elbows with the gentleman next to me a few times. The place is relatively small and difficult to feel comfortable in.   The food was good, I got a Patti Page burger and boyfriend got an omelette. Both of us had to get go boxes. Everything was hot and fresh when we received it.  The waitresses were very attentive and asked us how we were doing fairly often."}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant! The staff is friendly and helpful, the food is amazing (try the house made potato chips... to die for!)  All the sandwiches are delicious, biscuits and gravy... yummmm.  Got seated quickly, food came to the table quickly, it's not too loud to talk to each other, and the tables are comfy. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"My favorite part of coming to Las Vegas is coming to the omelet house after a weekend of adventure. No place like this. The food is delicious and the customer service is always above and beyond. Been coming here for over 10 years!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas.  I started off at Jamm's as my favorite breakfast spot, but I heard about this place and had to try it.  I went with a friend one weekend morning and scanned their menu for something good to eat.  Everything sounded great, so I went with my usual Denver Omelet and my friend has corn beef hash and eggs.  I have to say--their food is excellent.  Their breakfast potatoes our OUTSTANDING and their omelets are fluffy, full, and satisfying.  Great seasoning, not too much cheese, and just the right amount of filling, too.  Those breakfast potatoes are heavenly--I couldn't get enough!    I try to eat here once a week now because they are worth the trip.  If you want a great breakfast for very affordable prices with an interesting atmosphere, get off the strip and try this place.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Hole in the wall mom and pop joint. Huge portions and flavorful food. I love the home made breads they make. They change sometimes too. Banana nut, pumpkin nut, or bread pudding all made from scratch.  I will never get toast again!   Clientele was a lil on the older side but they did not discriminate! See you next year Omelete house!"}
{"text":"Trust me when I say... HUGE PORTIONS!!!  I'm so glad my bf found this place because its so close to home. Really good prices, great food, and huge portions. Kind of wish my server refilled my coffee cup or stopped by the table more but other then that, everything as great.   I came with my bf and we ordered The Kitchen Sink which included mushrooms, bell peppers, tomatoes, ham, sausage... italian sausage and a bunch of cheese and chili ($11.49)  We also ordered the pancakes which had 3 for $6.99. I was tempted to order their banana nut bread but luckily I didn't because the omelette came with choice of toast, banana nut bread or.. something else. Food came out within 15-20 minutes and my first thought was oh gosh... we ordered way too much.   I really enjoyed the chili in the omelette but my bf did not. It came with some potato chips which were unique and seasoned well, very crispy! The banana nut bread was super moist and yes, we slathered butter on it! Pancakes were so so.. nothing stood out. If you're craving pancakes I'd say try somewhere else. We ended up taking a pancake home along with half the omelette."}
{"text":"Local restaurant. Huge portions. Everything made fresh. Weekends expect a line for breakfast. Very reasonable prices. Only open for breakfast and lunch. Terrific staff. A hidden gem! Highly recommend! Five stars!"}
{"text":"My husband, my parents and myself went here on a Sunday morning. The place is small, but I like the countryish deco and it reminded me of a cafe in my hometown in Texas. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We didn't wait more than 10 minutes for our meals. We all got omelets (they have over 40 different ones!!). The food was abundant and so delicious. The omelets had to have more than 4 eggs each in them. Wow! I had breakfast for the next few days with my leftovers.  I will definitely go back and try something else on the menu. I don't think I can go wrong. On a side note, my dad did comment that the hash was on the sour side, but that some people make it that way and it was still good to him."}
{"text":"Potatos are amazing, a very solid breakfast choice. Bluberry infused french toast is ridiculously filling"}
{"text":"The host was very nice, not a lot of people. There was only one server I seen on our side of the restaurant. It did take awhile for our food to come. But I understood the situation, and the food turned out to be so delicious. I definitely would eat here again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in vegas so far i have been in vegas before but this weekend we find this place and is the best for breakfast. Best carnitas omelette i have also there also with it, really good.  The banana bread  the best.  Customer service on point they were really nice thats why i give them 5star."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. It's always busy and you think \"my god, I'm going to wait forever!\"  It's never as bad as it looks.  Staff is fast and efficient.  Amazing portions.  Go for a walk after your done!!  Kee up the good work!"}
{"text":"Not just Omelets! Other breakfast dishes are just as tasty with large portions. Nice stop with the Route 66 travels feel. We recommend stopping. Better than the usual chain breakfast stops."}
{"text":"Was not let down by the reviews and ratings! It was yummy. Although everyines fiod was great I have to agree with hubby and wasn't to impressed with the gravy. And I wanted to by one of the items they had for sale and couldn't because the person with the keys was not there. Disappointed because I really wanted to purchase the items. But I would eat there again. As a mattrr of fact I book marked it so when we cone back to Vegas we can go there again."}
{"text":"Found this place during a recent visit to the Lake Las Vegas area, thanks to my portable GPS.  Wow.. wish it had told us there were 6 eggs in the omelet!  Excellent omelets, quick and friendly service, no pretense, and yes, them potato spuds are damn tasty and addictive.  Type of meal my dad would be talking about for weeks if we forget to medicate him."}
{"text":"I eat here every Thursday morning at my networking meeting.  The potatoes are a \"Home Run\" with the great eggs or any omelette.    CeCe is the best server in town!  Love omelette house!"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast place! 4.5 star rounded up because of fantastic service and good prices.   Tricky to find the first time but worth the extra trip around the block.   It was busy but I got lucky and didn't wait at all and was seated quick. I was promptly brought my ice tea and she brought me extra ice and lemons without me even asking. Quick to take my order but wasn't ready, but perfect timing to come back and take my order. Brought an awesome salad and cup of soup within minutes. So many check-ins to see if everything was good, just amazing good service. Haven't been called hun that many times ever. :)   Simply amazing service and teamwork from all employees!   What could be better.  Wish the plates were heated to keep the food hotter longer.  Need hash-browns as option which they don't offer.  Chunks of ham needed in the split pea soup.   I'm excited to come back and try an omelette even though it's a little out of my way. Thanks Omelette House, see ya soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped at the Omelet House for breakfast on Veteran's Day.  Very busy, about a twenty minute wait.  I had a \"Mile High\", their version of a Denver Omelet with their special potatoes and pumpkin bread.  All of the above were excellent.  The only downside is that instead of butter, they serve a vegetable oil spread that is truly awful, and the only sweetener they had for ice tea was a generic version of Sweet & Low that tastes terrible."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was in love with this place, just good food and a nice atmosphere.   Fun menu items make good conversation, staff is super friendly, and food was just right."}
{"text":"OMG, service was great, but the food was a little different.  Who wants to eat potato spuds for breakfast?"}
{"text":"My wife had the pork verde omelette and I had their 38 special omelette - a kind of all-in meat omelette. There are 38 omelettes on their menu, along with a variety of other breakfast and lunch items.   The quality? Fantastic. In fact, my wife said it was the best omelette she's ever had (and that's with decades of eating experience).  The service? Second to none. Lola helped us out selecting the food and kept the coffee flowing.   I really couldn't recommend a place more than this. We are recommending it to our local friends and family and we will be back.   We saw an add on Yelp for them, saw their 4.5 star rating and decided to try them out. Great job, Omelet House!"}
{"text":"Phenominal food period! Over 30 omelettes to choose from & they got pumpkin bread!!  Great service non stop coffee refills!!"}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint. .I had the 6 egg chorizo omelet. OMG. .Friendly staff with amazing attitude. Definitely we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! The chicken soup was homemade with so much flavor...not like the  watered down kind reataurants usually serve. Breakfast portions were big. Will be going back when we visit LV. Hidden treasure:)"}
{"text":"This is going to sound like what most people would think. If you come here get an omelette, obviously. Don't do what I did, and venture out of THEIR norm. I got chicken fried steak, trash. Gravy was good. Steak was flimsy like a Banquet TV dinner. On top of their \"fries\" or spuds, or what Lays would be like if they were disgusting. Overall, awesome atmosphere. Great coffee. Good service. Terrible food outside their omelettes. How do I know the omelettes are good? My sister's food looked great. She ordered an omelette."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite spot in town for breakfast or brunch. It's absolutely one of those places you could easily drive past and miss altogether, but both the food and the service are fantastic! It has that homey, small town diner feel, and while it isn't much to look at, you won't regret it. I'm always sad when I think about it too late in the day. Wish they were open for dinner!"}
{"text":"After our first breakfast place was closed on New Years day we chose Omelet House and have to say. WOW! fast service friendly staff and glad I ordered the small Omelet three eggs was enough to fill me.  I saw the Omelets others were ordering and they were six eggs Big! Yikes to much food. They were delicious and the staff was fun and quick.  It is in a hole in the wall but it is well worth the visit. The strip mall has some funny shops but it is safe. Enjoy the food and leave with a full belly and safe some money from the strip food to gamble later with."}
{"text":"Great food, Great service, Great value, and Great coffee.  HUGE portions and the wait staff are very courteous. These guys and gals understand customer service!  When I'm in the Las Vegas area; The Omelet House will always be my \"go to\" list for breakfast and lunch . Oh yea...the spuds and pumpkin bread are awesome."}
{"text":"Shirley is really sweet here.  Very friendly staff.  Huge portions.  A Vegas staple.  Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! So I was there about 2 weeks ago! My BF and I rented a car to take our Vegas adventure off of the Vegas Strip. I use yelp a lot especially when out of town to make decisions on where to eat and what to do.   So this gem popped up and we agreed to give t a go. With a like almost outside (and was way beyond outside when we left) we are please to say this was an amazing experience and we are still talking about it! The staff, the customer service and oh my gosh that Omelet that I had! I had the Lobster something. It was so good! My BF said his was good too. He eats very healthy. And he was extremely impressed when they had turkey sausage AND turkey bacon! If you are ever in town make a point to go here, you will not be disappointed. And if there is a line outside. It's totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"As always.  Great food. Can share.  Had silver dollars pancakes.  Friend had a turkey burger with to die for chips.  Not the prettiest place from the outside but worth the trip"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  I would recommend getting the baby omelet though, six eggs is a little much."}
{"text":"When walking in, feels like you're at great grandmas house. Especially coming from Nebraska. Such a cute atmosphere!! I ordered the chicken fried steak with banana nut bread and a pancake. It was sooooo good. Not too greasy and super portion sizes!! We took it back to the hotel and are it as we got hungry!! The eggs were definitely good!! And tasted super fresh. Hubby got the pumpkin bread and we split, both were amazing!! He got the polish sausage breakfast and had no complaints.   The waiter was kinda slow and we sat awhile before getting greeted to order.  But not enough to knock a star."}
{"text":"This place is amazing it looks like a whole in the wall from the outside but the food is amazing and service is great. Fresh home made cornbread hash that was out of this world, and the serving size is wonderful. Highly recommended and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Took a while but the food was good and came out in enormous portions. Drinks were fine although they charged for refills. Omelettes not great if you are looking for a light breakfast since they are massive and heavy. Lobster Benedict and the complementary pumpkin bread were standouts for me."}
{"text":"This place is really good! We ordered corn beef hash, country fried steak and pumpkin bread. Happy New Years 2015!"}
{"text":"SHANNON.!   SHANNON.!   SHANNON.!  What a disgusting nasty horrible person! Who hired this person? Whom ever it was should be ashamed of themselves for being such a bad judge of character.  The worst \"service\" we have EVER witnessed. What a lazy wretched woman.  Our very first and LAST visit to this Omelet House location.  It started out with us waiting in the reception area for over 10 minutes to not only be seated but for someone to leave the employee party that was going on in the back.  We could hear laughing and joking from the kitchen area. Not one server or hostess could be seen. The customers that were seated were obviously annoyed by this.  We have been regulars of their other location down boulder highway and wanted to give this location a try.  A buss boy noticed us as he was the only one working and he politely asked if we've been seen and he was upset when we told him no.  He sat us then he quickly retrieved the \"hostess\"  from the employee party in the kitchen. It took another 10 minutes for the hostess to bring our drinks and another 10-15 for \"Shannon\" to waddle out.  She was wearing a shirt that was absolutely filthy and way way to tight.  We reluctantly gave her our food order and when the \"food\" was finally done she slammed the plates on the table spilling some of the food onto the table.  The food was average at best as none of us finished eating any of it for fear of food poisoning. When she refilled our coffees she over filled our glasses and spilled all over the table.  It was an absolutely horrible trip to the Omelet House. Since then we have heard from quiet a few people of similar experiences with other staff with marginal food quality.   DO YOURSELF AND YOUR INTESTINES A FAVOR AND AVOID THIS LOCATION.    If you are foolish enough to go, beware of the SHANNON."}
{"text":"Great staff and 4 of us was seated instantly.   Got a ham and cheese omelette and Split.  It was super large as everyone says it is. The fried potatoes were unusual they were not perfect but they were good and different. The quality of the omelette was perfectly made.  The banana bread was good but it wasn't the most amazing bread I've ever had. Everything was just OK and I'll be back."}
{"text":"We shared the 38 special. Ham sausage bacon & 2 different cheeses. Plus rye toast. OMG it was so delicious. I don't usually get omelets but I can't wait to try different ones. So glad we decided to share there is no way in the world I would have been able to finish it. I can't finish half of one. This might be our new Egg hangout"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the setting, everyone that worked there was so kind. I got the Health Nut omelet and it did NOT disappoint!!"}
{"text":"WOW! Food is plentiful!!! We shared the kitchen sink omelet and the spuds! It was a boggling amount to eat!! Boyfriend should have burst because he also had 1 biscuit and gravy!  He liked the sausage gravy much more than I did, but if you like sausage gravy, I would say to go for it!!"}
{"text":"\"Hands Down Best Omlettes!\"   The Irish Omlettes is my favorite here and the pancakes that come with it of course are amazing! Orange juice a bit on the expensive side but then again that's almost every breakfast place! Anyways I'd eat here before I would at ihop or Denny's any day!"}
{"text":"Holy crap balls. In town on vacation and the Airbnb we stayed in was close to this place on yelp so we came in for some brunch. So glad we did. The place inside is very homey and reminds me of my grandmothers house. Literally. The staff could have been a little warmer on the welcoming and service but the food definitely made up for it. The servings were huge! I couldn't finish it and had to take a bag home. And on top of that it was so fucking delicious. And didn't skimp on any of the ingredients.   Just go. It's fucking good."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I love the omelets, the \"health nut\", and the \"meat lovers\" omelet is the best. Great service, and overall, a nice relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was good as always. Very consistent. The service today was so bad I   Will more than likely not come back to this location.  Never got my water. Never got my tea refilled and they are not even busy.  The server was rude.  This was the worst experience here ever."}
{"text":"Omelette house is truly the perfect restaurant to get... a huge omelette! They have many to choose from, or simply create your own. Of course there are other great breakfast items on their menu and the serving sizes are large enough to eat half and take the other half home for tomorrow's breakfast! The service is always friendly, the food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Quick breakfast stop - we wished we had more time to enjoy.  HUGE portions beware but oh so good.  If you're thinking of sharing, share.  Omelets with homemade chips instead of hashbrowns and the pumpkin and another type of bread (both great) were served first.  No Amex accepted, but great service."}
{"text":"Holy huge portions, batman!  The omelets are HUGE, but very tasty. The potatoes that come with them are awesome as well.  They aren't your typical hash browns or home fries, but rather thin potato slices (almost like chips).    They do give you the option to order a smaller sized omelet for $1 less.  It's at the bottom of the menu.  Unfortunately, I forgot and ended up with a plate full of omelety, cheesy goodness."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I have to stop at Omelet House . Literally the BEST spot ever !!!"}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled in here for breakfast while on a trip and it was the best dang breakfast I have ever had. The potatoe chips for breakfast rock!"}
{"text":"Get the Lobster Omlet... delish.. Lobster & eggs may now sound like they go together, but they really do... Plus great service!"}
{"text":"A little off the beaten path but worth the drive.  Hole in the wall old school diner.  Had the homemade corned beef hash.  Awesome.  Shredded and chunked corned beef.  Do yourself a favor and get the pumpkin nut bread for your side.  Also fresh and homemade."}
{"text":"No better breakfast in this valley. Especially the Boulder Hwy/Lake Mead location.  Great place for family and friends. Killer huge omelets & yummy home-cooked breads. Comfort food at its best."}
{"text":"Excellent. Comfortable, love the decor and atmosphere, such good food, friendly service and they made a bunch of mini pancakes for our daughter which was so nice."}
{"text":"My sister and I come here always every Monday. Not only is the food great,staff is to. Eggs Benedict is my favorite."}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall, fabulous service and food. Pumpkin bread and breakfast potatoes are killer."}
{"text":"I couldn't find an IHOP, but we found this place and I'm so glad we did. My wife was pretty apprehensive because the building isn't \"trendy\" or completely modern. Yes, it's an average, older building, but it is clean and well-maintained. The omelettes we both ordered were excellent, hot and served pretty quickly. The service was phenomenal. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a \"comfort-food\" breakfast with a smile."}
{"text":"We landed in Vegas at 0730, starving after a three hour flight. I turned to Yelp to help find a good breakfast place and came across the Omelette House! And so glad did! It was fantastic!! HUGE portions meant we weren't hungry till mid afternoon! Tried the pumpkin bread because of the reviews, and it was delicious. My husband had the biscuits and gravy, and it did not disappoint! He got the \"hashbrowns\" which were essentially home made potato chips and were so good!! I had an omelette (I don't remember the name) with all veggies...asparagus, mushroom, tomato, broccoli...and I am glad I ordered the \"small\" size (three eggs instead of the regular size SIX eggs ). It was so good! Prices were great, especially compared to the nearby strip! Will return!"}
{"text":"A 12 egg omelet! No joke! I didn't have it but I saw it with my own eyes. I had a simple cheese omelet, unforgettable warm banana bread, and yummy thinly sliced potatoes. The service is quick, friendly and easy. You have to go off the beaten path to find this place but it is well worth it! We went before visiting Lake Las Vegas and Lake Meade."}
{"text":"Personally, one of my favorite omelets is the chili verde! Served with crispy chips to accompany the mix of egg, cheese, and green chili sauce. A perfect start to the last day of my work week"}
{"text":"Very good food here, I was very impressed. Excellent, friendly, service as well. I'd try the western omelette here, or they have another 100 or so you can try too. Although I'm trying to drop sugar, the chocolate chip pancakes are very good.  Clean bathrooms, always an added plus."}
{"text":"Loved the small home town feel of this place! Even though it was our first time we were greeted like we were regulars! The food did not disappoint either. My husband had the chicken fried steak and I had eggs Benedict. Both were delicious! The portions were huge so be prepared to take home leftovers...or even share a plate with someone. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"There are very few good places to eat breakfast in Las Vegas without going into a casino.  There are the chains like IHOP and Blueberry Hill, and while they are solid they are not great.  This place is great!  The portions are huge, the wait staff is great, and the prices are extremely reasonable.  You can get a giant omelet with toast, bacon, etc for about 8 bucks.  The omelets are great, but I recommend the stuffed french toast...and you can't leave the place without eating the pancakes...very tasty.  Very busy most times but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Perfect experience! Quick, clean, friendly and delicious. Amanda, our waitress, was pleasant and prompt. We ordered the heuvos rancheros and corned beef hash- both delicious and heaping! First time in Las Vegas and this was our last stop on the the way out! If I ever return, I'll be coming back to this spot for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, people were polite, service was fast, and the atmosphere was adorable! If you're looking for a quality meal right off the strip that doesn't cost a million dollars, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, the server Kelli recommended the Lobster Fest Omelette and she was dead on, it was really good, I recommend it too."}
{"text":"Awesome food in large quantities. Had the stuffed French toast with apple cinnamon cream cheese.  Wife had 1 of like 36 omelettes listed on their menu. Omelettes are made with 6 eggs!!!!   Definitely recommend. Great and quick service, too."}
{"text":"We waited for a bit o be seated and it was just us two (bf and I) waiting... but we were acknowedge by a waitress. He got the rio grande (I think that's the name), its #21 and I got the stuffed blueberry french toast. Delicoius!"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast!  Asked for a scramble without potatoes and onions but was told it was pre packed with all the ingredients and couldn't be served separately.   I got Eggs Florentine instead and the spinach was soggy and the sauce didn't have any flavour. The thin potatoes were the best item on the plate and they were not very nice. I ate half of one egg and couldn't eat anymore. We asks for a second serving of wheat toast and was told they didn't have any more. This was 7:15am on a Sunday morning.   There was only two servers on so the service was slow.   It's very disappointing to spend $25 on a sub par breakfast, I just can't see how they have four stars?  It will not be somewhere I go again. This is the second time we've eaten here, the first time was no better but it was six months ago and we wanted to see if it was a one off. It wasn't."}
{"text":"Best breakfast, food & service hands down!!! Our server was above & beyond explaining all the food options! What we ordered was so fresh & hot! Best ever & we will definetly be back"}
{"text":"Iconic old Vegas. This is the only location you should visit. If these walls could talk...  the soups are always reminiscent of home style cooking and hearty. the zucchini sticks with cheese sauce is a staple when we visit. sandwiches I prefer over the omelets, but that is just me. Enjoy this spot and soak in the yesteryears of the city."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Vegas!! Rachel seated us and Angela was our waitress. Angela was a mind reader and anticipated our every wish. The staff moved like a well oiled machine that didn't skimp on great customer service. We will be back when in Vegas! My Eggs Benedict was bomb ."}
{"text":"Dear Lawd!! Omg. Breakfast is an important meal in our home. We yelped this place and we were NOT disappointed. They had 32 different omelets to choose from and a huge variety of other breakfast foods. I ordered the lobster fest and my husband order the chicken fried steak. As we waited for our meals we got more and more excited watching everyone get served. The plates were huge with the food piled on high!! Our breakfast cake and it was heaven. My omelet was packed with lobster and cheese with almost a complete avocado on it. My husband's chicken fried steak was huge and so crispy. I took the time to read their lunch menu and it looked amazing. We will make this a must go to spot every time we are in town. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent, amazing food and great service. The pork chili Vertie omelette was the best we ever had. The stuffed French toast with apples and cream cheese was delicious. Definitely going to stop here again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast this morning and our waitress Cece was the best.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town!  Big portions and banana nut bread with real butter is BOMB!  I ordered the small portion and it was still more than what I could eat at one time...and leftovers for lunch.  The potatoes are great too."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Poor service and poor food. Seated quickly and offered drinks. asked for two waters and coffees. There was no cream on the table so I asked for half and half. Waitress brought non dairy creamer and left before I noticed. When waitress returned I asked for half and half again and pointed out we had non dairy creamer. Waitress said she would bring some but that most people didn't care either way. I really don't care what most people do. I asked for half and half the fist time. We both ordered omelets. I started with pumpkin bread and my partner with banana nut. The pumpkin bread had a awful metallic taste and the banana bread had a scorched aftertaste. The omelets came, a popeye (spinach) and a jolly green giant ( a combo of veggies), both very big and served with a large side of potatoes. The potatoes are dry, hard potato chip things and not at all good. Both omelets were very dry. After a couple bites I sat at the table waiting to get noticed by someone. I wanted some salsa, anything really to make the omelets edible. I sat long enough for the food to get cold while watching various employees walk past the area, eyes fixed straight ahead or at the floor making absolutely no notice to anyone or anything in the restaurant. Finally someone glanced our direction, we waved her down and asked for salsa. She returned with two little cups of salsa and our waitress returned to add them to the check she had delivered along with our food. I was surprised they would charge for the salsa and said to cancel it and at this point was completely over it and no longer wanted the food. I went to pay at the register. no one asked how it was. I was considering asking for the manager but was too annoyed to want to speak to anyone and figured if that is how the place is run, they probably don't give a shit about much anyways. I paid my $26 and just chalked it up to a shitty restaurant. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to Utah and it was terrific!!! Service A+ Food A, wait time A+ sat at counter and it was comfortable not crowded. Service here is absolutely top shelf!!!!  The side of potatoes were good but not typical. Kind of like chips. Seasoned perfectly!!! 3 egg omelette was big and delicious!"}
{"text":"Minimal wait. Friendly staff. Huge portions. Fast service. Luckily my hubby and I split a chile verde omelet because they must have used a dozen eggs to make it!   I recommend their banana nut bread for starters. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Great food, the pumpkin and banana nut breads are sooo good. The 1/2 omelettes are huge and contain only 3 eggs instead of the regular 6 egg omelette. The prices are very reasonable and better than casino prices. A gem off of the strip."}
{"text":"This place is so cute on the inside!  It's very homey and what I would imagine Betty White's house to be decorated like.  The staff is also very friendly and there was a nice kid that was selling newspapers by the door.  I can't believe they had so many omelette variations on the menu!  If you are an omelette fiend then you have to come here!  They average around $10 but they are seriously big.  I don't like how they have a split charge, but I guess their omelettes are fancy enough for that.  I mean, where else can you get a lobster omelette?  Not IHOP.  I got the King of Hearts and it was amazing!  It was huge and loaded with yummy artichoke hearts, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, fantastic!  It also came with these potato chip things.  Potato circles?  Potato slices?  They weren't crispy but not completely soft either.  Well no breakfast is truly complete without some potato side-dish so I ate them anyway.  I also got the pumpkin nut bread which was good too, but probably would have been better for me if it didn't have nuts (ew).  It was very warm when it came out and heavily spiced.  Next time I'm in Vegas I have to stop by here again.  It's refreshing after eating at a ton of casino buffets."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy was good.  Husband had omelet with crab and veggies, said some of the veggies were canned not fresh and seafood was imitation.   This was a one and done.  Nice server."}
{"text":"Went here fked up. It's pretty standard, not gunna lie, but WTF WITH THE PORTIONS! you get a lot of what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Second time here, both times were great! Excellent service from start to finish!  The food is fresh, perfect and fast!!  The homemade Banana bread and Pumpkin nut bread are a great start to any breakfast!  Both times we had different omelette's, both times they were so amazing! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I get it. This place has been here for years, in this industry that is not always a good thing.  My party had 3 different hosts try to seat us. There is no organization up at the door. Idk why the restaurant is laid out like this to where walking to your table you have to walk through the busser/server side station....very unorthodox.  We got sat and didn't get greeted for 17 minutes. I started timing it on my phone after 5. We had to grab another server who clearly wasn't supposed to be ours. She kind of saved this \"experience\"  I specified to my server I was vegetarian and didn't touch meat. Low and behold my omelet was full of sausage. Gross. I lost my appetite after that. The avocado on my omelet was turning. Either it was originally bad or it was in the expo window wayyyyyy too long.  Banana bread was probably the best part of the meal, sadly that's not a good thing.  I'm upset with the fact no manager came over after ALL OF THIS. Maybe the server should have told the manager it was going this bad. Nothing was done on the check for anything. Losing clientele isn't a good thing, especially locals.  Had really high hopes for this place and it fell flat on its face."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe that I ate half my breakfast, my  omelette here was enormous and the stack of sliced potato chips was awesome . I was overwhelmed, I had to get the banana bread so damn good, I am glad I got that first, very cool spot and it's been here since 1979. That's sick"}
{"text":"Place should be legendary if it isn't already. I don't have the words (should've... sent... a poet), but you should show up hungry.   Watch for 33 1/2."}
{"text":"Banana bread is the greatest on earth! It's worth driving here just for that alone. The breakfast is huge and the price is tiny! My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great service, AMAZING FOOD!!! The biscuits and gravy were just like grandma's. My new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!! If your looking for that home cooked breakfast this is the place. I played it safe and just got a waffle special but it was delicious. I also tried the banana and pumpkin bread. I preferred the pumpkin but both were delicious. I had them to go. I wish I would have heated them up and added butter then they would have been heaven sent. We went on a Sunday morning so we knew there would be somewhat of a wait they quoted us 20 mins. And we probably waited a little less than that. Our service was decent. I don't like to be bothered to much while eating. Waitress was very polite and friendly. Definitely recommend this place for a low key home cooked breakfast. We"}
{"text":"Mmmm that banana bread and pumpkin bread is to die for!!!!!! Wonderful homemade breakfasts it was honestly one of our fav meals the whole time we were in Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"Its our first time here. I ordered the lobster eggs Benedict and my fianc√© ordered the kitchen sink omelet. We both enjoyed our food... it was delicious!! Portion was also great for the price  highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wasnt anything special, make sure when you order you get a baby size because the meals are huge. One pancake is the size of 3, hot chocolate was bomb tho"}
{"text":"I ordered the Health Nut subbed zucchini for spinach. Best breakfast in Henderson/Vegas and for a great price. Warning portions are huge!"}
{"text":"They have a great menu selection.  Both times I've been, there's been a wait. You know that it's a good place!   The first time we sat next to the window and unfortunately there were some flies that kept bothering us, and my husband even had to kill one cuz it kept grossing me out. Sigh.   I really enjoyed their White Egg omelet (comes with veggies like squash, spinach, and some other stuff), their potatoes are tasty (they look like homemade thick potato chips but sometimes aren't crispy. Whether crispy or soggy, they do taste good).  Choose the Banana bread! It's delicious and a huge portion. Tastes great w/ their coffee. I had their pumpkin bread also, and the Banana is definitely the best!"}
{"text":"I really liked the biscuit and gravy here. They have good basic dinner breakfast and great service. Would recommend anyone give them a try."}
{"text":"A year later and thousands of miles away and I'm still thinking about that damn pumpkin bread."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, huge portions and great tasting!  The location and parking lot may scare you away, but go, its worth it!  All the staff we encountered were friendly!"}
{"text":"Monday morning before leaving Vegas breakfast led to Omelet House. Okay, but pretty average in my book, at least our selections. You could tell how popular this place is by the almost full parking lot. The server that showed us to the Garden Room, mentioned how crowded they were, probably due to it being the day after Father's Day. The Garden Room was a bit more intimate, fake plastic hanging plants and all.  Our server gave us a few minutes to look over our menus, then we decided on the following: my wife the Health Nut Omelet, since in her words \"you can't come to Omelet House without ordering an Omelet. That would be like going to IHOP without ordering pancakes\". Her extra tomatoes were noticeably missing and when brought to the server's attention he removed the        additional .79 charge. She also chose the banana nut bread which came out first. She shared it with me but I only wanted a small sample, which was very good and moist. Our plates arrived not too long after. Oh, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with scrambled eggs. Good sauce and large portions, but I've definitely had better. I also ordered a side of 2 Turkey Sausage Patties(average). Not to say that I didn't clean my plate, my wife even joked that all I needed to do now was lick it. I was hungry. She had plenty to bring back home. One plus was the size of my regular order of orange juice. No need to go large when regular is enough to wash it all down."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this cool spot. They have a huge list of omelettes (duh). I ordered the South of the Border...I think that was the name...it has chorizo. I asked for avocado which I think made it awesome. What I didn't know is that a normal order is made with 6 eggs!!!! Someone at another table ordered it and I was flabbergasted by the size. They have an option where you can baby size it and they take .99 cents off the menu price. You can split a normal order between two people but they charge you $1 to do that...but it's not a bad option. My friend and I will be splitting an order next time bc it is cheaper than both of us ordering our own \"baby\" size. Splitting would be around $11 vs splitting a $19 bill. Great place and cutely decorated. P.S. The potatoes are bomb!!!"}
{"text":"We live their food. The best place to go after church. Their waffle taste like a sugar cookie, it's so good. Decent portions and the spuds are delicious. The eggs Benedict all kinds are so great. Clean bathrooms which is important to me. The staff is excellent."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service and location.  What else could you want?"}
{"text":"Exceptional service and extremely friendly. We were a party of ten and they sat us down just a few minutes after we had arrived. They quickly had our drinks and made sure they had a server come to our table and refill our drinks. The food was as equally great. Loved my experience here and definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The layout and atmosphere are unique. The sheer size of the place prohibits self seating, as the server may never find you. We were greeted with the proverbial \"we'll be right with you\" from two different employees. Once seated, we waited again. Of course, I opted for the chicken fried steak and was met with some resistance when trying to substitute a pancake for my choice of bread. The eggs were cold, I'm sure due in part to the cold draft coming through the door we were seated next to.   The chicken fried steak itself was pretty good. Tender with a flaky breading covered with country gravy. However, it was served on top of what is usually fresh and crisp potato chip like, fried potatoes. I had to move the CFS to it's own plate for proper consumption.   The service was slow at first, but once they got rolling, the coffee and water were never empty.  I would give the chicken fried steak nearly four stars, but the overall rating is only three stars this time around. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast stop! Excellent customer service, vast menu, easy to reach from the strip and the interstate. Highly recommend the pumpkin bread option, which arrived as an appetizer - delicious, and served with real butter."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've stopped here many times while my car has been serviced nearby, and on additional occasions as well. I still have yet to be disappointed! I've tried the stuffed French toast as well as 8 or 9 of their omelets, and I've always been impressed. The portion sizes are for individuals with a large girth only! I feel comfortable saying that I eat larger portions than the average American, and I normally have to box up what's left of my meal and take it home.  The service here is immaculate as well; they're very friendly, and I've never waited any longer than 5-6 minutes to receive the food.  I'll definitely be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"The food is awsome, the people are awsome ansmd this is the best breakfast in town (locals spot)"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place so decided to check it out. There were lots of cars when we pulled in which was a good sign. When we got out the car we could smell the aroma.   The waitress was the best. She was cheerful and seemed happy to be there.   When our food arrived it was fresh and hot! We were able to order the banana bread instead of toast with no extra cost.  This is a gem if you want good inexpensive food."}
{"text":"6 egg omelets! Liberty Bell omlet is stuffed with Philly steak, peppers, mushrooms and cheese. Served with thinly sliced potatoes, similar to a kettle chip. Hot pumpkin bread. Fabulous service...always a person walking around to refill coffee. Highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, never disappointed, the staff has changed and could be a bit more pleasant but the service i can't complain. The food is amazing, I've tried almost every omelet on the menu and there isn't one that I don't like."}
{"text":"Not sure you could ever beat this place on breakfast! I'm impressed to the max! I mean so many inlet choices and they are delicious and huge! And then the warm pumpkin or banana bread and butter you get to choose before your meal comes out is killer! I eat way too much for my own good when I go! This location is kinda hidden and we almost didn't find it but I'm so thankful we did!"}
{"text":"So wonderful! Large portions and friendly service. I recommend the shrimp and spinach omelet... Its amazing!! There's no shortage of ingredients so bring your appetite. But honestly everything is delicious... Take everyone you know!"}
{"text":"We had the lobster benedict and the porky pig omelet. Portions are huge. Prices are reasonable. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love finding places to eat off my normal radar especially breakfast places! This is like going to grandmas house for breakfast. Nothing fancy to look at but the food is great. I had the salsa verde and pork omelet which came with these delicious potatoes and a big slice of the most amazing banana bread!  The coffee was your normal cup of joe with no fancy sugar or creamer so don't come here thinking its Starbucks. But hey a cup of coffee and a good breakfast make my whole day!"}
{"text":"A nice break from the fast pace of the Strip. If you are looking for a delicious, inexpensive breakfast this is the only place you should bother with. And they have Frank's hot sauce on the table which is a rare find out west."}
{"text":"Very large portions, so much to choose from on the menu. Our waitress was delightful and informative. Was nice to see all the waitresses/waiter helping and working together. We will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Oh my god, superb omelettes and customer service, and it's cheap and comes in portions you can/should split. Sides of potatoes are amazing, like fat potato chips but seasoned perfectly. Chicken noodle soup great, superb service. Crowded busy place but it moves, worth it.  Too tired to write more, but you won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Okay a local favorite for many years. if anybody's ever eaten at the omelette house they know how good the food is. If you haven't eaten at the omelette house what a shame you missed out all these years.   They serve breakfast & lunch with lots of delicious omelettes, good sandwiches and of course the banana nut bread and the pumpkin bread is worthy of going just for that. The names for the different omelettes are pretty funny  It's tucked in the back of a shopping center. From the looks of the exterior you would never dream of all the delicious things behind the doors. Family owned and operated it has kind of a grandma's kitchen feel with wood d√©cor and pictures of the family on the walls as you walk in the door.very busy around lunch time so come early. Lots of seating and they get you through during lunch pretty quick, it's just busy.  I had the Californian omelette and it had sausage avocado and Jack cheese the home cut potatoes are thin cut like chips with seasoning. My wife had a omelette with peppers and cheddar make sure you order the baby omelette unless you're extremely hungry the omelettes are big!   Great for breakfast"}
{"text":"Classic lv breakfast and lunch spot. I highly recomend the lobster omelet and the Ortega chili burger..... This place is always good. Expect a small wait on the weekend's and holidays. The servings are huge and well worth the price."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that the \"Comedy on Deck\" Grand Canyon tour stops at for breakfast so we had a limited menu to choose from but it was still very enjoyable. The service was great and the portions are very generous, also the little potato chips are amazing!  Even with a group of about 30 people the stop here went off without a hitch and I was surprised. The drinks and food came quickly with no problems whatsoever. Since the breakfast was including in a tour that we went on I have to say that I was more than satisfied but I'm not too sure as to how this place is on an everyday basis."}
{"text":"So I go out to Vegas at least once a month and this will be my new favorite place to come for breakfest!  Best place ever great big portions you can get baby size which is 3 eggs instead of 6 eggs for the omelet the biscuits and  gravey are amazing the service was great and quick Richard  was the best waiter ever!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place it is great if you are needing a go to spot with all American comfort  food.I ordered a side of one scrambled egg and a side of pumpkin nut bread .It was very filling it filled me up for breakfast and lunch.My favorite thing is the homemade pumpkin nut bread."}
{"text":"We thought this place was delicious. I ordered the green chili verde omelet which also came with \"spuds\" which were freshly sliced potatoes and fried to resemble chips (but not as crispy), seasoned with a yummy seasoning. Very large portions so be sure to come hungry.   Service was great and never had an empty glass or needed anything additional from the waitress. Next time I'd like to try the pumpkin bread (I had an English muffin) as it seemed to be a popular choice with others who were eating around us."}
{"text":"this place is ghetto-fabulous, and that's definitely a compliment.  it has an old-school greasy-spoon feel, but it's homey at the same time.  the portions are huge, and you can get tortillas instead of toast!    this place is always good for a hungover weekend breakfast....avoid the crazy $40 juice they advertise on teh tables, though."}
{"text":"Nice old style deco. You can tell it's been here for a while. We were greeted and sat promptly. 5 of us. The omelets were huge and great. I ordered The Italian adding bacon it was awesome the kids ordered other omelets and they were amazing as well. The service was the best I have seen in many years just great."}
{"text":"We passed this spot many many times & never stopped. One of our friends mentioned the pumpkin bread is awesome so we decided to stop for brunch. Can I just say that we are a bunch of IDIOTS for passing this place up. *on our knees* \"We humbly apologize Omelet House, please forgive us for our breakfast snobby-ish attitude.\"  Lets  start with the exterior. Its very 1970-ish and its in between a storage property and a McD's right on Boulder Hwy. They have a huge yellow Omelet House sign towering over the bldg with another sign in the front that says \"the home of the 3 lb burger.\" The interior decor was like a country diner, nothing fancy.  It was pretty empty @ 11:30am (we aren't complaining) there were a couple families and a bunch of metro police officers. I believe that policemen know all the good eats around town and they were coming in and out of Omelete house...a good very good sign.   The service was excellent. We got greeted and got our drinks...double quick. Our waitress Gina was very friendly and kept our drinks filled. She took our order and our food came out pretty quick. They have a wide range of menu items.   We ordered the: -Homemade corned beef hash, potato fries, eggs up. The potato fries are different and addicting. Hash was ONO- it had more corned beef than potatoes ...my kind of hash. -Philly cheese chicken sandwich w sauteed mushroom & onions. My wife loved the taste of it but said she'll ask for light cheese. -We had to order a pancake just to try it, since they did sell a single pancake for $2.39. I like it like that- sometimes its a waste of money to order a short stack. Pancake was nice and fluffy, perfect golden brown. -We also ordered both  of the pumpkin and banana nut bread...they were both very good. I give the nod to the pumpkin bread. They also have the 3 lb burger challenge or a 12 egg omelette (we'll leave the challenges to Chestnut & Kobayashi).  This is one of those joints that you don't judge a book by its a cover. They are only opened from 6am to 3pm, so don't delay...plan your next breakfast here and you won't be disappointed. if you aren't happy with their food...then you can pleasure your simple palette right next door at those golden arches. Aloha!!!"}
{"text":"Stuffed French toast is delicious. Food is good and worth the price.. a lot of good, so bring an appetite."}
{"text":"My man and I got to enjoy breakfast here when I was child-free for the weekend. There were so many omelets to choose from. I decided on a bacon, cheddar and broccoli half sized dish. It was still HUGE (I would hate to see what the full size looked like). The potatoes were yummy and well spiced and the pumpkin bread should have its own food group. I also enjoyed an orange juice concoction with what I can only guess was sprite and spices (weird I know)....it was delightful. The server was a little cutie pie. You could tell she was quite young (probably 15 or 16) and just super friendly and adorable. I felt bad  because the table behind us was really rude to her (I think they were from Jersey). I wanted to get up and slap the mean and nasty chick upside the head (my mommy instinct kicking in) but she handled it well.  Will come back here when I get to that neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent food! Eggs Benedicts can be hard to perfectly cook the egg and they topped perfect here. Service was quick and we got a greeting as soon as we walked in. This is an amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the largest omelet I have ever tried to eat.  I was not successful.  The food was good and the staff attentive.  I ordered the potatoes crispy and the we're awesome.  Like thick cut homemade chips. My wife ordered a pancake.  And it was good.  She also was unable to finish the omelet.  I suggest if you are with someone, split the omelet.  It's great food."}
{"text":"Very yummy omelette , my husband and I shared the cowboy chili with pumpkin bread! So good and so filling which is why we shared! Service very friendly and fast! Glad we stopped as we were here in city for football tournaments !"}
{"text":"They say the omelets are large here and they sure as hell aren't exaggerating. I came here with a large party and several of us were determined to finish their omelettes in one sitting. I was not among that company. Just getting through 2/3 of this monstrosity took an absurd amount of effort.   I went with the cowboy, which is basically beef chilli and cheese in an already enormous (must be at least 4  or more eggs) contraption. The chilli is tasty- I had no problem wolfing it down. Bit of advice-- If you are feeling a bit of health guilt and opt for the wheat toast as I did, make sure to ask for it UNBUTTERED or else you will be treated to two gelatinous slabs of what used to be a healthy side dish. I can't say I was impressed with the fried potatotes-- they were extremely greasy and soft. In other words, not appetizing at all. Our party ordered some fried zucchini as well which came with some tasty ranch, and some not so appealing nacho cheese like substance.  Our waitress was pretty friendly however, and I thought the coffee wasn't bad. And in terms of restaurants in vegas, this place is bordering on iconic-- it's a known landmark on Charleston and is often frequented by Old Vegas money. The selection is very impressive-- they basically have an omelette for every possible taste preference you can think of. If you're in the mood for a hearty dance with the devil to start off your day, this is your spot."}
{"text":"First time here and the only thing better than the food was the service! Didn't wait long for a table and it's such a neat place. DH got the kitchen Sink which he couldn't finish (he said it tasted very good) and I had the Italian Beef sandwich (not really big on eggs) which was very filling and tasty. We will definitely be returning on our next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing polish sandwich tender meat grilled bread yummy!  Omelet was huge and the potatoes were delicious a hidden treasure location. Really good"}
{"text":"I came with my co-interns during orientation and we were a little rushed but managed to have a quick lunch here. Best of all, they were able to accommodate our large group of 13 at one table (this restaurant is huge with several dining areas).   There are a lot of fun decorations inside so the atmosphere is really quite charming. Service was also very friendly and attentive, though in retrospect, we should have stated at the beginning of the meal that we wanted separate checks.   The menu is quite large (literally, the double-sided single page menu is printed on oversize paper), and as the name of the restaurant suggests, they have quite a few omelet options, many with clever names. They also have a full breakfast and lunch menu.  I ordered the lobster benedict, which took a while to prepare but was tasty (though I wish it came with some fruit and/or vegetables). Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dishes as well.  Not open for dinner, but I recommend coming for a hearty breakfast, brunch, or lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a long time.  I'm always looking for a good chicken salad for lunch.  Their Cajun chicken salad was actually pretty tasty.  The spices were just right and there was a decent amount of chicken on the salad.  I'm not a huge fan of Iceberg lettuce, I would have preferred Romaine Lettuce or a Spinach Salad.  The portions are good and the price is reasonable...There's not too much to not like about this place...Now I just need to go back and try one of the omelets and the pumpkin bread which everybody raves about!"}
{"text":"One of my fav places to eat breakfast when I'm in Vegas. Nice portions of food, I'm always satisfied with the portion and taste here. I love the warmed breads they bring out(big piece of bread-pumpkin or banana nut) or you can have toast or biscuits and gravy.  Everything I've ever had here was cool though."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! If you don't like the omelette house than you simply don't like breakfast or Vegas. Fresh baked bread, crispy potatoes and fat a** omelets in an old school Vegas atmosphere . What's  not to like!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time this month and they have the most amazing breakfast potatoes!! Had an omelet with egg whits and artichokes and it was yummy!! Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Not everyone likes potato chips with their eggs or for breakfast for that matter. We prefer hash browns!"}
{"text":"My husband says he doesn't want Vegas buffet and I didn't want Peppermill (our usual stop). I'm soooo glad we found this place! We almost didn't stop because there was a large group of people waiting outside, but I'm glad we went in anyway. We were seated within 5 minutes of arrival and the service was prompt and solid. I ordered a baby sized omelette and it STILL was too much for me to finish!! And PLEASE treat yourself...get the banana walnut bread! It's AMAZING! This is now our go-to breakfast spot whenever we're in town!!   I know they have another location in Henderson because I saw it as we left my niece's house...so if you've NEVER been, I swear you won't regret it! It'll be the best breakfast decision you've ever made!!"}
{"text":"It's all about the omelettes and the service here - forget the spartan surroundings and pick an omelette from the huge menu.  My favorite is easily the Chile Verde - it's been a while so I don't recall the number, which means I need to go back.  I can't comment on anything but the omelettes because I've never eaten anything else.  Actually, that's a lie - I've had a side of the corned beef hash, which is also damn tasty.  Even the potato wedges on the side and the bread they serve prior to the meal is outstanding.  Bottom line is that this place rocks for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I'd give this breakfast spot a 5 if the coffee weren't so weak--looks like tea! But the staff is efficient and  friendly which made up for it. These omelettes are ginormous!! Ingredients taste fresh. I ordered a veggie omelette --required salt pepper and hot sauce but very good and cheesy. Veggies were fresh and plentiful --I added Ortega green chiles for  extra flavor. The banana nut bread is homemade and served warm!! Yum!! Definitely coming back. Great value!"}
{"text":"OMFrikkenG!!! I frikken love this place so much I went back the next day! I had the lobster Benedict,  my son had the crab & shrimp omelet. I have never had so much lobster on my breakfast plate before. The wait staff is amazing, my coffee cup never got cold! The best breakfast in Vegas hands down...and I'm picky!"}
{"text":"Food's OK, not worth dealing with management though. Always thinking about the next customer instead of the current ones. Specifically the male manager with grey hair wearing a purple shirt and khaki shorts.  Thanks for the reply, guy.  Apparently you didn't notice the other tables around us who walked out not appreciating having received the same kind of service. Guess they weren't \"honest\" enough either.  The woman who attended our table was actually nice and playful and she was as concerned about getting the rest of the party there, but she wasn't rude about it and getting in our faces in the same manner. That's another thing you should learn to respect: personal space. It's not nice to lean waaay over the table not really saying anything, making faces, and just kind of sweating over our plates. And unless you had your timer on and were on it, I'd be hard pressed to say it was an hour wait. And it wasn't like the present party wasn't ordering drinks, appetizers and entrees in the meantime.  I noticed that you only respond to negative reviews where you think you have the upper hand and can get the last word in. I hope that continues to go well for you and I hope you can maintain your friendly staff to cover up for your managerial (if you are in fact, a manager) ineptidude."}
{"text":"My family & I came out to Henderson, NV for my mother-in-law's surprise 60th birthday. My sister-in-law also lives in Henderson & we asked her if she could recommend any really good breakfast/brunch places nearby and I'm glad she did!  Once we walked in, Omelet House seemed pretty busy & crowded, but you can tell why once you taste the food! Super delicious! I ordered the French toast w/ bacon & eggs.. Very tasty! The wait for the food was shorter than most waits that we've experienced at Denny's or IHOP.. we were pretty shocked at how fast the food came because of how busy the restaurant was!  Definitely plan on coming here at least once EVERY TIME we're back in Vegas/Henderson!"}
{"text":"Ginormous 6 egg omelet. Comes with either pumpkin bread , banana bread, or toast and sliced fried potatoes. Chile verde is yummy.  Old diner setting. The servers are very nice & the service is friendly"}
{"text":"6 egg omelet- basic nothing special I asked to sub spinach in lieu of zucchini, I don't mind paying for it but the server didn't mention there was a $1.09 extra charge Served with potatoes that were deep fried chips and pumpkin spice bread that was nuked in the microwave too long.  The server brought the bill but didnt come back to close my bill with my credit card."}
{"text":"This little breakfast joint is the BEST!  Fast service and the food was very good.  We ordered the food and I took 2 sips of my coffee and the food was already coming out!!!  I ordered the baby portion omelet (only 3 eggs).  The regular size omelet comes with 6 EGGS!!  It huge!!  If driving through I would totally stop in here for a late breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast or lunch. The food portions are big and tasty, and the service is fast and friendly. Probably the best place in Vegas for breakfast."}
{"text":"After getting burned on multiple Strip recommendations (that's the road, not strip clubs), I sought a highly rated breakfast place that was a little more local, away from the hungover sin fest and douchery along Las Vegas Boulevard. I'm sad to report that my new favorite omelette (or omelet?) is two time zones away from where I reside. This is why we need to eliminate time zones altogether and have one universal clock. Then that way I could have Omelet House anytime I wanted. Er, wait...  ...Anyway, think Denny's, but way nicer and friendlier and less greasy. Actually, don't think Denny's. It's a quaint, old-timey establishment that is unapologetic for what it is. I'm surprised to find these kinds of friendly, no-frills restaurants with (mostly) good folks in them. That's what I get for forgetting that Las Vegas is still a city outside the Strip, with hospitals, offices, grocery stores, and friendly restaurants. My older server was delightful. And when people say the omelettes (or omelets?) are enormous, they are not lying whatsoever. They're gargantuan and hearty. And with many options to choose from, you're sure to find one to your liking. The spuds on the side, though, are basically potato chips but harder to eat. You get a choice of banana bread or pumpkin bread or toast before the meal, which is fun.  But what bothered me most here was, as a guy was bussing a table, the manager came out behind him wiping tables (typical manager, doing the easy part), and called him out in front of everybody, saying he needed to pick up the pace because his fellow associates had made complaints about him not working quicker. I hope that manager reads this: that's not okay. Do that kind of thing in private. I guarantee you that kind of management toward me would have the opposite effect than me working faster.  One-star reduction for the spuds (although they are unique, which is nice) and that manager.  Omelettes (or omelets?): 5/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"Meh. The  big crispy homemade potato chips are awesome and make this really a 2.5-star place, but I can't in good conscience round up to 3.  No one greeted us when we walked in, and we had to wait a while to get someone to seat us, and our waitress was not exactly friendly and I felt like she just wanted to push us out the door the whole time (they close at 3 and we arrived at a little before 2). I had a feta cheese omelet which was huge (I didn't feel hungry for the rest of the day) but lacking in flavor (and feta). The pumpkin bread was a nice touch, but nothing amazing, and the coffee was weak. Also, two omelets, a soft drink and a cup of coffee totaled over $30 which just seems totally ridiculous for this kinda place."}
{"text":"Superb service.  Everyone helps each other out there at taking care of the customer.  Huge portions too!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's because we drank too much, but our whole group barely ate here.  I had a few bites of the pumpkin muffin and forced myself to eat half of the huevos rancheros.  I think it was too greasy for us to eat or maybe we're just getting old, sigh..."}
{"text":"Big servings, very prompt service, owner was visible and making sure customers are having a nice time..."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the old diners my grandfather took me to when I was a kid. The decor is the same, old and full of memories. The place may be old but it really appears to be clean. When my wife and I entered on a Wednesday morning about 830, we were greeted and seated right away. The waitresses are almost too quick. We had our drinks immediately and our orders taken right away.  I had the chicken fried steak. The steak was good but the oil tasted a little dated. Maybe I just came at the end of the oil cycle. Nothing special about the potatoes but they were good.  Overall our experience was a good one. Great feel to a diner rather than a box breakfast place. We will return."}
{"text":"My bf and I ate here yesterday. When we got there we were not acknowledged right away,  there was no line to be seated and we were probably waiting for about 5-7 min and finally they noticed us and sat us down. The place was lacking a bit AC. When we did order our food, it was served promptly though, they were also on top of my bf coffee. I had my mouth set for some steak and eggs, but unfortunately they did not have that on their menu, which is kind of rare. They are know for there yummy huge omelets....six egg omelets, enough actually for two people! I ended up ordering the \"popeye omelet\" but with sausage instead of bacon. It was really good, but it had a bit too much cheese on top. Their banana bread was delicious, I really recommend it. Overall it was a pretty good place to eat at and we would eat there again."}
{"text":"Hefty omelet that's for sure. I didn't finish and I'm not ashamed to admit it. Good family restaurant that's the best option in this little suburb, and definitely a better value than any of the chains of Vegas buffets. The menu is to be applauded. I spent longer trying to select a breakfast here than I have anywhere else in recent memory.  And surprisingly, this coffee was actually good for this type of restaurant. I almost bought a mug. Almost."}
{"text":"During our trip to the Hoover Dam, lunch in the Omelet House was included. I chose a burger with potatoes. Unfortunately, except for a strange off-taste, the burger was completely tasteless. In addition, the fried potatoes were far too soft for my liking. The service was ok.  To sum up, I am unable to recommend the Omelet House."}
{"text":"Well, Yelp has yet to fail me.  The pumpkin bread is as amazing as everyone says.  I had the lox omelet and it was delicious. Biscuits and gravy were to salty for my liking.  Definitely will be returning here the next time in Vegas"}
{"text":"I just love this place! I have been eating here since I was a wee little girl. I love taking people here who haven't been which is usually someone who has moved here from somewhere else because what true native hasn't eaten here?! When family comes to town this is my go-to place to go out for breakfast.  I can't go and not get an order of \"Fried Zucchini Sticks\". They are the best I have ever had! They come in a half or full order and you can get cheese sauce or ranch or both for dipping. If you haven't tried them yet please do! I always get the \"Green Hornet\". It has avocado and cheese and tomatoes. I am notorious for it and just can't change it but do take a bite off my families plates hehe!  Just so you know, the omelets are made with 6 eggs so if you don't think you can eat that much you can just ask for a \"baby\" and they will make it with 3 eggs. They also give you a little off the cost for using less eggs I think it is like 75 cents or something. The spuds are so good too. I usually ask for them with no salt and love to dip them in ranch dressing.  The lines can be long but you don't wait for long and the wait is more then worth it! This last visit we waited maybe 5 minutes. They are only open for breakfast & lunch. During the week it isn't as hectic as trying to eat at Omelet House on the weekends but still consistent."}
{"text":"So I am only giving 3 stars not because of the food. The food was fabulous. However Dmanatha and Dina the servers are rude and very unfriendly. They do not make you feel friendly. Ad a matter of fact they made me feel like I was a bother. When I asked Dina for crispy spuds she said I should have informed my server ahead of time. I have always had crispy spuds so I have never had to do that.  Ride and made me feel like I was a scolded child"}
{"text":"We came here from Vegas on our way to see Boulder Dam. Breakfast and service were amazing!! Highly suggest their home made corned beef hash"}
{"text":"During our stay in Vegas I was in the mood for a \"home cooked\" type of breakfast. We found this place thanks to Yelp and it looked really busy. When we walked in we were expecting to wait a long time, but we were seated right away. I ordered \"the Californian Omelet\" which had sausage, avocado, and jack cheese. My husband ordered the \"Lobster fest Omelet\" which had chunks of real lobster, avocado, and jack cheese. Both omelets were absolutely delicious, filling, and very huge! It's big enough to share and I for sure had some leftovers. Our waitress was attentive and super friendly. If you are in the mood for a yummy hearty breakfast, this is your place and you will not get disappointed."}
{"text":"We were in town for the Vegas Cup soccer tournament this past weekend.  We decided to eat here after the reviews on Yelp.  We arrived with our party of 11 and the place was packed!  Luckily we didn't have to wait too long.  Our server was so friendly (wish I could remember her name).  The portions are huge and the food was very good. I loved the fact that the wait staff worked as a team and filled coffee, water, etcetera when needed. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful old style customer service. Food is fantastic! A must try or a once a month breakfast kinda deal."}
{"text":"To make things simple, foodies should not go to Vegas and neglect to visit this jewel! It's not on the strip, but it is worth the 10-15min commute. Omelets your way...and they are huge and flavorful. The home fried potatoes that compliment your omelette are good, though they pale in comparison to the omelette. Oh, and the banana or pumpkin bread that come with your meal is delicious, as in better than your grandma's (if your grandma could really cook). I got an omelet with shrimp, crab, avocado, and cream cheese with egg whites and it simply blew my taste buds away. Fresh, hot coffee and they keep your cup full!  Old school feel by the ambiance of the place...very homey, rustic and charming. The service was amazing! Server was very attentive, full of recommendations, and worked to meet dietary restrictions of my group.   Hands down, 5 stars!! If in Vegas, don't miss out on this breakfast masterpiece!"}
{"text":"Oh my God!  Where should I begin?  When I make a trip to Vegas, this well kept secret is a must. Everything is delicious, hot and prepared to order. Of course the omelettes are to die for, but you have to have slice of their freshly made pumpkin bread or banana nut bread.  My new favorite is the country fried steak omelette.   DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"The pumpkin bread and banana bread are freshly baked and served piping hot.  My girlfriend and I loved this place so much we actually came back the next day for breakfast.  The omelettes are ridiculously huge...you won't leave this place hungry at all.  Definitely go small if you don't have a large appetite... the regular sized omelettes are made with 6 eggs, whereas the smalls are made with 3-4."}
{"text":"We went to for a late brunch at the omelet house......it was packed! The manager seated us right away, though, and took care of us personally. We did have to wait a long time for the food, but the biscuits a s gravy were worth the wait. I wish they had an alternative to the potato crisps- but all in all, the food, service, and prices warranted another visit soon."}
{"text":"Omg I'm so full! This place is a nice little spot for a great burger. They have a Monster Burger challenge and then they have just regular burgers. I ordered a regular Mushroom Burger and It was the size of my head. I thought I was doing the challenge. Friendly staff, made sure coffee and waters were topped off. Spenser Nail ordered a omelette and couldn't even finish half of it. Great price for the amount of food you get too."}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE SERVICE IS THE BEST!!!!  SUPER OLD SCHOOL. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!! I WISH i remembered my servers name, but she was amazing!!!! + the price of the food is a total shock with all the food they give. So worth your bucks. SO happy i came here. The server took care of us like we were her own children, and she knew we had came back from a rave as well so she made sure we had plenty of water and food.  Love her!!! I come to Henderson Once a year every year and i will be back! EVEN though its out of my resort.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast joint...why?  Because I love corn beef hash and this place has the best corn beef hash I have ever tasted!  If you are a huge fan of corn beef hash, then you will LOVE this breakfast place as well.  There were chunks and chunks of corn beef with potatoes.  I got the meal so it included the potato spuds (these are thicker home-made potato chips) and the homemade pumpkin spiced cake.  Everything was sooooo delicious.  This was a huge portion.  I took half of my food to-go and ate it for a late lunch and still tasted as delicious as during breakfast.  Too bad they didn't have rice...I wonder if I can bring my own rice and just order a side of corn beef hash (pondering...nah).  Oh how much I love delicious corn beef hash over rice.  nom nom nom  I repeat, this is the best corn beef hash I have ever tasted..."}
{"text":"Great food. I have been coming to Omelet House for 30 years, usually for a huge breakfast. Also, their Pumpkin bread. They used to just bring you a piece to taste, now it is only by order ($2.99), worth it. Today I had a salad. I couldn't finish it. Just get on over to the Omelet House to see for yourself. You will love the D√©cor too, so homey."}
{"text":"Loved the omelet. Great ambience was an added bonus.we had the Popey and joes special.the portions were big.in fact we found it difficult to finish.we also had a banana nut bread which was yummy.overall,a very satisfying breakfast experience and highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 28 years................literally in my mother's womb I was ingesting this GOODNESS!  It is my go-to breakfast comfort food!  I've tried many a things but my go to favorite is the Californian omelet......oooooey goooooey jack cheese goodness!  The potatoes are my favorite in the city, even in the country, hands down no questions asked!  But the reason I continue to go here is the PUMPKIN NUT BREAD.........what!!!???!!!???!!!  I cannot get enough nor can I duplicate this recipe at home; makes for a great excuse to go back! The decor kinda makes me nuts........lots of STUFF everywhere, but that's not what's on my mind while I'm eating there.  And the hostess, the older woman that works during the week................LOVE her!!!  I can go six months without eating there (at one point it had been over a year) and she still remembered me!  I felt special!  It's the little things like that, that make me want to go back over and over again! =)"}
{"text":"There on it here, we got a seat ASAP!  As we were sitting, the waitress asked us what we would like to drink.  So our coffee came to us right away.  She took our order.  I like to try different stuff, so I did the lobster eggs benedict.  Hubby did the basic, waffle, sausage, eggs and hash browns.  If we had known, we wouldn't have ordered the extra hash browns, because I couldn't eat all mine, and he couldn't eat all his, we could have just shared.  But my lobster benedict was really good.  Yes, I would try it again.  The waffle was really good, it was fully, crunchy and light.  They close at 3 p.m.  So get there in time to enjoy your food if you check it out."}
{"text":"I love a good ol' hole-in-the-wall breakfast. This place delivered on their chicken fried steak & eggs, but it needs a major renovation. It looks like an old Village Inn where a bunch of people dumped their unsold garage sale items. That sounds harsh, now that I'm reading it, but truly this place would attract more customers if they overhauled the decor.  Service was good! And not just ours. I could hear the neighboring server, and she seemed to be doing a great job."}
{"text":"As the breakfast \"barometer\" for The Omelette House, I seriously suggest having your business meals here! The staff is excellent and the service superb!"}
{"text":"When you go to a place, and its named after a dish, for the love of everything, order that!  The omelets here are super huge and super filling.  The height of the omelet alone is just shy of an inch! They super fill the omlet as well, I don't think this meal is made for a normal person. I also love how they do the potatoes!  I wanted sausage and biscuits and regret not ordering an omelet.  The gravy was pretty weak and lacked in flavor. (-1 star)  The staff were super nice and welcoming.  The place is pretty packed with regulars and not many tourists (like our group).  If you drove to LV, or willing to cab it, I'd say its more than worth it!"}
{"text":"Great service! Very friendly staff and always refilling our coffee. The food was Excellent!"}
{"text":"I give this privately owned chain one star, not because of the food but because of the prices.  You can bet that having one of their namesakes (an Omelet) and a coffee, will cost you $15.  While portions are big and the food is good, I just don't think it's necessary to overfeed people, and, yes, charge for it!  Oh, and if you want cheese with that skillet breakfast ... it's an upcharge of .99.  Salsa with that, $1.99, breakfast potatoes with your omelet instead of potato chips, that's and extra too!  We will not be back anytime soon.  Too many choices that are just as good without being overpriced and nickle and diming."}
{"text":"Pumpkin Bread.....AAARRRGGGGHH!!!! MORE BREAD!!! I've never been a fan of bread, but the Pumpking bread here.Wow. The 1st bite got my attention. The 2nd bite with butter.....YUM.  Then we had breakfast.  The portion was filling. Comfort food Vegas style. Definitely a place we will visit again next tri[p to Vegas."}
{"text":"Our first visit is definitely not our last! Nice diner and delicious food! The service was fast and servers were very attentive to our needs! The waitress definitely recommended some great choices for us first timers and I can't wait to try other menu options!"}
{"text":"Immediately greeted upon entering.  Seated immediately.  Waitress was attentive to us. Good food served fast and hot."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a group of 14 and enjoyed friendly, prompt service even with four separate checks. The food was great!  I had the corned beef hash and eggs and both were great. Hubby had biscuit and gravy and loved it.  Friend's chorizo omelette got a thumbs up as well.  The decor is old school Vegas, lots of tables in the back as well as booths.  Will definitely stop here again!"}
{"text":"Spent four nights in Vegas last week and had breakfast here twice. First time I ordered the comp banana bread and The Californian omelet (jack cheese, sausage, and avocado) - truly the best omelet i've ever had. So delish! Two days later I ordered the comp pumpkin bread and got the same omelet: it was THAT good! Both comp bread are excellent but the pumpkin bread is my favorite - served warm with a pat of butter - heavenly!! Also served with the omelet is a huge pile of homemade potato crisps...but omelet was so large that had only a few crisps, which were slightly salted and quite good. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Potatoes are original and yummy. Coffee cup will never be empty as everyone serves you as a team effort."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast hands down. Never leave hungry and always satisfied. Staff is great and always have more than enough items to satisfy everyone in your group"}
{"text":"Terrific, down to earth breakfast and lunch.  Nothing froufrou or crazy.  Omelettes, hugely portioned, and potatoes, and other similar dishes.  Everything is well-cooked.  The staff are nice enough.  Service is fine.  The decor and ambience are nothing to write home about.  It's a bit shopworn and nostalgic.  But who cares? It's a nice feel, if a tiny bit grunge.  But the food is just fine."}
{"text":"I have been to Vegas over hundreds of times but this is my first time staying in downtown and trying out new things around the area. We happened to stumble upon this place based on previous reviews on yelp and boy oh boy! What a find this was. The place does not disappoint everything from their six online to their iced coffee was delicious to the core. A must visit !"}
{"text":"Best place off the strip to have breakfast. Everyone there was so friendly always called us sweethearts, I got the Flapjack Special and spouse got a huge chile verde omelette. Loved it"}
{"text":"This is the go to place for breakfast if you are in the Las Vegas area. A few years ago we at at the Henderson location, and I have been dreaming of their Lobster Eggs Benedict ever since. So while here for a quick trip, it was on the top of my list of places to dine. Needless to say, I was not disappointed!   It all starts with the service. The staff(from hostess to waitstaff) were so friendly and welcoming(congrats to Loni's son that just got married). They were not just trying to feed us and turn the table, they actually took the time to chat and make us feel \"at home\"(not many places in Las Vegas do that). They coffee was just what I needed to wake me up, but was not punch you in the gut strong like so many of the chain coffee places. The portions are huge, so if you're really hungry, go ahead and indulge, but know that you can easily share. My hubby had Californian omelette, and loved it(insider's tip: order the baby size...it's only three eggs). All the egg entree's come with homemade potato chips(more please!)  I saved the best for last: the Lobster Eggs Benedict. Loaded with chunks....yes chunks, of lobster and topped with homemade hollandaise sauce. The eggs were cooked to perfection! It was worth jumping off the diet train and indulging. Again, this was accompanied by the those delicious homemade potato chips.   The kids had pancakes and sides of bacon and ate every bite. This is our new go to breakfast place when in town."}
{"text":"This place is always 5 stars, I live in Los Angeles and when I'm in town I always make an effort to come here. Great good, fantastic service ."}
{"text":"After seeing  the great reviews decided to try this place out this morning. The ambiance reminds me of a hometown diner from 40 years ago. Dated, but I liked it. Was seated promptly and the friendly waitress went over the many, many omelette choices. I chose #38 the meat lovers.  It was served quickly with pumpkin bread and good fried potatoes which were sliced into chips. This was a winner!  Good food and plenty of it. Good service It is a bit of a drive for me, but well worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in town! Mom and I go here for delicious affordable breakfast. We usually get a #10 to split. Always yummy, although the potatoes are always my favorite part! Super friendly staff and the service is almost always very quick. We love it here!"}
{"text":"Hi.  I grew up in Las Vegas and have eaten breakfast at the Omelet House many times.  My experiences have always been decent which is why I am completely disheartened by my family's last experience with the Omelet House.  Yesterday, my husband and our two children, ages 8 and 4, were running errands and decided to have breakfast there.  My husband had been fasting for blood work.  The facility was across the street and as anyone who has ever had to maneuver around Charleston and Rancho knows, it is quite difficult to get around due the no u-turn lanes and multiple lanes of traffic.  My family parked at the Omelet House and walked across the street at 9:50am.  He signed in at the blood place at 9:57am.  He returned at almost 10:25am ready to eat food and noticed that his car was missing.  The Omelet House had him towed.  Now I understand the need for ample customer parking on busy days, like weekend brunch, but it was Monday and there were many open parking spaces.  The gentleman and I use that term loosely, claimed that he waited 30 minutes to call the tow truck, but tow records show that they called at 9:52.  As my now stranded husband was trying to figure out what to do, The Omelet House staff read to him from a piece of paper something that ended in him needed to leave the premises with threat of arrest.  Did I mention he had two small children with him?  When did we stop treating people like people?  How would parking in the lot been any benefit to my family unless they were planning to eat at the Omelet House?  Well, if the purpose of the parking policy is to keep people from parking there, it worked.  I know of at least 4 people that will never park in the parking lot again.  Good job Omelet House!"}
{"text":"Staying at Paris in the strip and as you can imagine it can become very pricey, so my family and I  decided to venture off and try and a new spot. We asked the parking attendant and they recommended the omelet inn. What a great choice!!!!!!  Great food, service and atmosphere. If your looking for very up scale place and waste your money this isn't the place for you, but if you are looking for a great place to save money enjoy your food with great service then come check them out."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love the fries and the omelette. It really is a family restaurant like they say. I would go here erry Sunday with my pops. One of the restaurants that I personally think is best well run with at this location"}
{"text":"Delicious! The potatoes were great with my omelet! Serving was SO BIG I could NOT finish it, definitely worth the money and could get two meals out of it!  Only reason it's not 5 stars is because it wasn't anything... special or unique. It was missing that \"WOW!\" factor that would draw me back whenever I crave breakfast.  Pumpkin bread was also AMAZING! But I am not a fan of nuts, so I wasn't fond of that part.."}
{"text":"Seriously good food. I had no idea. After eating here I do not understand why anyone would wait for hours at the damn peppermill.   Service was outstanding, extremely friendly and willing to help pick out something tasty on the menu.  The pumpkin bread was fantastic. Served piping hot with tons of butter this little slice of heaven was extremely moist. It also came out before the omelet which was great because I was staving.   I picked the baby meat lovers omelet which was three eggs loaded up with bacon, ham and sausage and then packed with two types of melty gooey cheese. It was great. The best part of this plate might have been the freshly sliced potato chips served on the side. They were fried crispy, needed a little more salt but other then that I loved every bite of them.   This is the best breakfast spot around."}
{"text":"2 years later from my last review, and I still love this place. Definitely try the pumpkin or banana bread, they serve it nice n hot with butter.  Service is always good! This is the family atmosphere here with customers and workers alike.  For example, police officers come in frequently for breakfast, and we've seen Sheriff Lombardo and Commissioner Sisolak. They're all very friendly, saying hello or starting conversations.   Constant coffee and water refills are still going around all the time.  Everything on the menu is hearty servings. I'm always switching it up between the omelets, French toast, and breakfast special (on the weekdays).  What I like the most, they accommodate requests. I know the potatoes can get soggy, so I request them extra crispy and they're served to perfection. Same with the baby Greek omelet, since the feta cheese can make it soggy I ask for it to be cooked well done. If your first time here wasn't to your liking, I recommend you give it another shot and request how you like certain things, they don't disappoint :)"}
{"text":"The food is always good here. Today the service was becoming a concern. Our server Amy sincerely apologized. Thank you Amy! In a world where people are harsh and quick to be mean spirited, I appreciated and accepted her apology! Everyone has rough times in a day! Highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The kitchen sink is a six-egg omelet with diced turkey, hot dogs, peppers, chili and more. I am not a huge fan of meat cut into perfectly square cubes. It reminds me of grade school hot lunch, but I ate half of it and boxed up the rest. Goodness, the pumpkin bread is as amazing as everyone says it is, and so are the potato fries.  Weiss' Deli serves better food and coffee but the service at Omelet House is outstanding, and so are the sides. I will definitely return. Glad I tried it."}
{"text":"I went into the restaurant without looking at the reviews for the first time in a long time. Thankfully I did! The food was beyond amazing. The service was a little slow but they were extremely nice so I didn't mind too much."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for breakfast or brunch off the strip.  Like most places off the strip, the price is very reasonable and the portions are big.  we ended up ordering waffles with eggs and sausage, and the vegetable omelet with added ham.  as there preparing the food the server will give you hot fresh banana bread to munch on.  food came out nice and hot, full flavored and fresh ingredients.  the omelet was so large we had to take it home to go.  they have a wide variety of items, pretty typical breakfast and brunch items such as big breakfasts, pancakes, and eggs Benedict.   if i ever go back i would like to try to the eggs benedict.  great prices, large portions, friendly staff, overall great destination for an off the strip place for breakfast at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We ended up sharing a table with a couple from New York  (right next to the kitchen) since it was so busy and the hostess was having trouble figuring out how to seat people accordingly.     The pancakes were ok......the syrup was just warm, caramel colored HFC Syrup. No flavor.  They did not have real butter......so not much to top them with.  Between the other couple and us, we ordered, Potatoes, Corn beef Hash, pancakes, egg white omelet, Denver omelet and a side of bacon.  Nothing looked nor tasted good. Omelet's were under cooked and very runny.....and their 'famous' potatoes???  Seriously????  They were under cooked and lacked flavor and no amount of ketchup helped.   Highly disappointed based on the high ratings for this place. On the up side.....we did enjoy dining with the New York couple.....the only highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"My wife and kids brought me for Father's Day and it was our first time dining here. Heather was very nice to explain the menu in detail for me and make some good suggestions. We all had a great experience and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Large serving portions, great food and excellent service!  I highly recommend this little diner!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place is awesome! Huge omelets with a ton of varieties!"}
{"text":"Well being in a wheelchair I gotta start off with accessibility.. With a little help I was able to get in the front door .. The incline to it was pretty steep though.. Luckily I didn't have to do the deuce because the bathroom could not accommodate a wheelchair person at all.. I'm pretty much wheelchair bound so I wouldn't be able to transfer to the toilet at all.  With that said... Let's get to the food. I had the B B AND C . Broccoli Bacon and Cheddar .... It was awesome but I didn't care for the potato chips they pushed off as potatoes... Stale. Asked for extra Bacon so it was all good. Had the pumpkin bread... Scrumptious.   Food was great... Cept the potatoes.  ADA accessible bathrooms need a lot of work."}
{"text":"OMG, this is the place that we would go to every weekend if we lived in Vegas. We read about it on Yelp and we were not steered wrong. We went for breakfast and it was nothing short of fantastic. I got the corned beef hash and it was without doubt the best I have ever had. Real corned beef, big chunks of meat that were tender and tasty. The hash was moist and not at all dry. I got the banana bread to go along with it and it too was excellent. The homemade potatoes are like potato chips and were a bit weird for breakfast, but that did not stop me from eating almost all of them. The wife loved her turkey eggs benedict. The best she ever had. She got the pumpkin bread. The breads are obviously homemade and fresh because our were hot out of the oven. The portions are huge. This place is a deal and a steal. I just wish that Dallas had a place like this. If you are in Vegas and love good breakfasts, you have to go here."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on vacation with our friends! Good portions and wonderful service. Worth the short drive."}
{"text":"Nothing like going to a place, put our name on the list, wait and three groups one I. After you and are seated. When we ask nothing is said the just take us back to a table in the middle when asked for a booth. We left! Won't be back for a while, for them a loss of about $400 to $500 of revenue. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"This place is legit when it comes to omelets!  The portions are huge!  I got the meat lovers omelet and it was dericious.  Had a server who offered great service.  Would definitely come back especially on an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"We had the egg Benedict and polish sausage & egg with banana nut bread , it was so good !!!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the omelette was amazing. Definitely a must go for anyone who appreciates good quality breakfast."}
{"text":"Make sure to come with a biiiiiggggg appetite, food are so good and big portions, we came for breakfast and end up with breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner all in one meal! Reasonable priced and very good food. The restaurant isn't in the best area but the facility and set up was gorgeous and roomy. Our family was so surprised to see the number of customers, just to prove that place is popular and good."}
{"text":"Classic breakfast place for locals and non chain lovers.  Skip Dennys and the casinos for the best selection of omelets you can find, 38 pre-made choices and endless options to create you own.  I went with the chili omelet which was excellent.  The chili was not too spicy and had a sweet taste up front and a little spice at the tail end.  It was big enough to share between two hungry people.  It came with a side of homemade potato slices that are fried, not quite a potato chip but a little thicker but delicious.  For an appetizer I tried the fried zucchini and loved it due to it being battered in a tempura style batter and the cheese sauce was a strange choice of dipping sauce but it was a tasty decision.  Great place to eat off a hangover but on weekend mornings it gets busy so be prepared for short waits."}
{"text":"My chicken fried steak was off the hook Would definitely go back kind of far off the strip but worth the drive will keep you from throwing all your money down those slot machines Waitress was great service was fast but we were there pretty early who knows when they get busy"}
{"text":"Great place Great service Little off the beaten path But there chicken fried steak is on point Will go next time I'm in Vegas worth the drive Potato s are delicious too Everything was perfect"}
{"text":"For a breakfast place, this place is pretty good. It is a little hidden and hard to find. the decor was a little too cluttered and eclectic for my taste. If you are craving an omlet this is the place to go. Their menu is full of every omlet you can think of.  I had the lox benedict. it was good and rich. maybe a little too rich. overall if you are looking for a diner style breakfast this is the place to go."}
{"text":"33 Omelet choices, really? I got what I was looking for, a great food experienced. 33 different omelets with food combinations that blew my mind.  I never would have thought to mix some of the food.  The omelets are made with 6 eggs (enough for two), homemade potato chips and bread choices (I chose the homemade banana nut bread- hot w butter). The staff deserved 5 stars; friendly, helpful. Great for this adventurous woman!"}
{"text":"The spuds are to die for..great service. The Polish sausage was a bit salty. Great banana bread..and served warm...yummy..will be back"}
{"text":"How does this restaurant have such high reviews?  I paid $15 for a Lyft ride because this place looked like the place to go based on the reviews.  When I walked into this restaurant there was a smell I could not identify but it did kill my appetite.  I was going to still give this place a try despite the smell but when my girlfriend spotted what appeared to be a cockroach on the floor we immediately left."}
{"text":"My husband and I ALWAYS eat at the Omelet House when we visit Las Vegas, which is at least 2x a year. Even my parents have made it a tradition and many of our friends who we've recommended it to.  - The banana bread is amazing! Large portion, moist and delicious. We order it as an appetizer while we wait for our meal. - My husband always gets an omelet. Today he actually got the \"baby\" version bc the standard is so large. We came in on a motorcycle so we couldn't take leftovers. - The mushroom burger is soooo yummy. Yes, on vacation, it is perfectly OK for a grown woman to eat a burger for breakfast. Don't judge.  Even when there's a line, we've never waited more than a couple minutes. There's plenty of seating, the servers are attentive and the food comes out quickly so it keeps everything moving.   Just, stop looking at reviews and go eat!"}
{"text":"the biggest omelette i have ever had and it was really good.if your in vegas and you want a comfy spot to have a very good meal.this is your place!.we went here for breakfast all three days we were here in vegas .all three times the food was great and with great attentive servers.its very relaxed and comfortable here and check out the signed celebrity pictures they have on the wall, very vegas.enjoy!"}
{"text":"HUGE serving of luscious lobster eggs benedict, side of lightly fried perfectly prepared potatoes, frequent coffee refills and all close to home. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The Banana Bread is off the chart good.  Had #38 omelet 6 eggs, sausage, ham and bacon.  Potatoes on the side are a mix between chips and hash browns. All very good food.  For small appetites get the half order this will keep you from having a food coma.  Service was fantastic.  From the great smile and energy from the host all the way tho the end with great service from the waitress!!  They had multiple people running around with coffee pots keeping our coffee and other drinks full!    Small wait at 9:45 for fifteen minutes.  Not bad for a great breakfast place.  I would wait a lot longer if needed next time.  I highly recommend this place.  Umm good!"}
{"text":"Fried zucchini is your friend.  Banana bread is your friend.  Pumpkin bread is your friend.  Sharing an omelette is your friend.  The last piece of advice is especially true because the omelettes served here are huge.  I definitely had trouble finishing an omelette myself (I didn't finish).  The fried zucchini could be a meal in itself.  Crisp batter, tender zucchini, and ranch and cheese sauce.  Doesn't get better than that.  One thing to remember if you decide to go here is that their portions are HUGE.  The country in decor is cute and the servers were all around some of the nicest people I met in Vegas. Definitely sharing next time, but not the banana bread or the pumpkin bread or the zucchini.  :)"}
{"text":"Great service. Great price for the amount of food you get. Try their pumpkin or banana nut bread."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. They give you really big portions of food. Enough for at least 2 meals. You will definitely have food leftover for later. The service is great too. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not sure how I haven't reviewed this place yet. I lived in Henderson for a couple years, but my brother has lived there far longer and said we had to go for breakfast. Their potatoes are prepared like no other breakfast place I've ever been too. Very good. My child verde omelet was incredible, also confirmed by my wife and brother who agreed that I made the best choice. Don't know when we'll be back in Henderson again, but when we are, Omelet House will be one of our first stops."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have always had a weekend tradition of going out to different breakfast joints every Saturday morning. We can say with certainty we have tried at least 90% of all of the breakfast places in the Las Vegas-Henderson metro area, and we have no reason to return to any of them after we decided to stick with the Omelet House.  Unlike the most other breakfast spots like The Cracked Egg or The Egg and I, where on a weekend you will almost certainly have a 25-35 minute wait for a seat (generally the wait is outside), I have personally never waited for longer than 8 minutes to get a seat here, even when the line goes out the door. We are seated in a variety of interesting rooms with lots of neat old decor (think grandma's house), and drink orders are taken immediately, no waiting for a server! They serve topnotch Farmer Brothers coffee, which is a major plus for me since I'm a big coffee drinker. The menus are simple and descriptive, and offer all the usual breakfast fare, with a major emphasis on the omelettes. We have a few favorite servers there, and we usually get Devynn (hope I'm right on the spelling) who is nothing short of fantastic and kind. Orders are taken quickly, and I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my order to arrive (I time it every weekend, just to see if maybe I'm wrong, thankfully I'm not!)  It's impossible to describe the food without it sounding like hyperbole, but I can genuinely and honestly say this is the best breakfast I have ever had. I've seen a lot of restaurants boast about their portions, and the value of those portions, but Omelet House cannot be beat in that regard. The omelettes are simply huge, and packed to the gills with whatever ingredients you like (and trust me, whatever you want, they have). I can't recall ever finishing an omelette in one sitting, come to think of it. I usually get a #9 bacon and cheddar omelette, plus I add chorizo. I couldn't tell you if it's a four-egg omelette, because it looks like they used a half-dozen eggs to make it. They also serve excellent seasoned fried potatoes with every omelette, sort of like really thick potato chips fried and seasoned with a salty garlicky mixture. Generally the potatoes are heaped on the plate to the edges, even on top of part of your omelette (which gives you a few potatoes with cheese on them!). They serve steaming breads with their entrees, currently the choice is between pumpkin or banana bread, either of which are fantastic. The portions are large enough that I usually take half of the omelette home with some potatoes and reheat it in the late afternoon for lunch or dinner.  As another important point, the value of what you get for your dollar is incredible. We pay $29 plus tip for this gigantic meal, which is basically two meals for each of us since we have a ton of leftovers (not quite Hash House A-Go-Go huge, but pretty close, and much cheaper!). The crowd is also much more mellow and friendly here, with lots of Rotary Club, motorcycle club, Elks Lodge, etc. folks coming here to enjoy some socializing. If you are worried about obnoxious kids and loud diners, you won't find them here. Just considerate older adults for the most part, which is why we love to come here (we're probably their youngest customers, we're both 28!) I also get the sense that the emplyees are well-treated, and some have been there for a very long time, which speaks for itself. I know that cooking, serving food, cleaning floors, and dealing with entitled customers can be very hard, but I've never seen it on anyone who works here. Everyone is very respectful and kind, and the manager is very direct and firm, but also respects the people who work here, and I can appreciate the good business sense.  In all, this is the best place to enjoy a good breakfast and chat with your friends and loved ones, and it's a great place to start a weekend breakfast tradition. If you do, we'll see you there every weekend, because they can consider us customers for life."}
{"text":"That's a great place I totally recommend it to anyone that like good breakfast coffee and great customer service when we all meet together for breakfast.  Great place for family get together good breakfast very recommended....."}
{"text":"Wife and I love this restaurant! We really enjoy their breakfast, coffee and delicious pumpkin bread! Anytime we have family in town this is the breakfast place we take them to. So far everyone we've taken here loves it.   My mom and her friend enjoyed the pumpkin bread so much they got a whole one to go and put it in their luggage when they flew home!  Their omelettes are quite large so if you're a light eater go with the baby option or even share it with a friend. I believe they have an option to split the omelette onto a second plate for a small fee.  If you go during the typical breakfast and lunch times expect a small wait. So far, after five years of going here once or twice a month we've never had bad food or service."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to the Omelet House but the memories from my recent visits bring to mind a tasty breakfast experience. For the early birds (like me) it's important to note that they aren't open super early (7:00 AM) but if you're hungry it's probably worth the wait. The dining area is made comfortable by the homey diner decor and I've always been pleased with the service.   All three of my visits consisted of similar orders (omelets/homemade chips) so unfortunately I cant speak with much variety but that should also show how much I enjoyed the omelets. First and foremost the portions are HUGE, there is no way you will leave hungry. I've had the Popeye, .38 Special, and both the Porky and Petunia Pig omelets with the homemade potato chips and never finished my meal in one sitting. My Popeye was a little under seasoned but the other two I had no issues with. I usually get sourdough toast (dry) with my breakfast but I've had the pumpkin bread once and it was a pleasant alteration from my norm. Nice and moist with good flavor and not too sweet.  This Omelet House is definitely a breakfast spot I'd recommend."}
{"text":"We meet here every week for a networking meeting and the food, and service is as good as it can be.  They serve 50 people in the matter of minutes as regardless of what I order it always exceeds my expectations."}
{"text":"Our Sunday morning routine includes breakfast at the Omelet House. Great service and good food. We keep coming back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the omelette house ever since I was a wee gambler. Thank God for my Vegas connections that told me about this gem back in the day. The O.H is situated towards the back of a little strip mall. The decor is 1970's grandma style....very quaint and nauseating with the random selection of things. However, I swear there is a room where you can get married located all the way in the back of fhe restaurant. \"I do!\" Now bring on the banana bread wedding cake lol (for those that know what I'm talking about).   Food: A+ with gold stars. I've tried their omelettes even though they have other things but why go to the OMLETTE HOUSE and order a salad? I've never been disappointed with the food. I go for the petite selection which is 3 eggs versus the OG size of 1/2 dz eggs. ALWAYS order the banana bread as your bread choice. Moist, rich in flavor, warm....mmmm   The zucchini spears are good too. Service was on point but it was Monday mid-morning.  I've been during weekend and there is a little wait but never to the point where you say, \"forget this.\"  They close at 3pm (I believe) but check with them to make sure. Till next time O.H.....wish there was a clone in L.A."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Nothing special. One star dropped for the service: although the staff was nice, 3 different servers kept coming over to us constantly, every five minutes, asking us how we were doing. It got very annoying.   Another star dropped for the WAY TOO HUGE menu (please cut it in half, holy crap) and the massive portion sizes but mediocre flavor. My eggs Benedict wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. My husbands omelet was HUGE, like way too big for any normal human to eat, and just kinda meh. He got The Californian.   Maybe for someone who can eat 25 eggs at once, this place would be awesome. But for us, it was just way too much and that was sort of a turn off. 75% of our plate was left untouched. Reheated eggs Benedict and omelet is just not tasty.   Also, the coffee was bad and my pancake literally looked like someone took a bite out of it when I got it. I ate a portion from the other side."}
{"text":"I am so pleased with the high level of service from the staff and the kitchen! I called to order something not the menu... and they were able to make a sausage biscuit with egg sandwich! I ran over on my break from work, and it was ready at the time they said it would be. The hostess Beatriz was very friendly, and quick. I was even more pleased and surprised when I opened my order to find potatoes spudz chippie things inside and ketchup! I love when service is so spot on, and a restaurant exceeds your expectations."}
{"text":"Another winner from YELP!    While visiting family in Las Vegas, wanted to go out for breakfast.  Although we were staying near the strip, everything there is overpriced and underdelivered.  We wanted to go somewhere for a good homecooked meal.  The Omelet House did not disappoint!  The omelets were huge.  My 14 year old son had one with chili in it and try as he might, he couldn't eat the whole thing.    They were served with crispy potato chips, toast or banana bread.  Delicious.  This is definitely a place where two people could split one meal.   Family owned restaurant has been around a long time.  Not fancy, but darn good food."}
{"text":"Having visited Vegas on numerous ocassions, we have visited many hip and chic breakfast spots.  However, we wanted something plain.  The \"fusion\" restaurants sometimes overdo things that should remain simple.  So, we decided to leave the Strip behind and find a true local spot.  Omelet House quickly entered our radar.  After reading the reviews, we knew that the portions here were large.  So, we decided to share an omelet and a waffle.  What a pleasant surprise!!  The OH is a diamond in a mountain full of carbon.  It truly delivers on taste and service.  Their signature \"chips\" put normal hash browns to shame.  I must say that I was so happy that we chose the OH as our breakfast spot.  It will be a regular hangout when we're in the Vegas area.  I highly recommend giving the OH a try.  You will not be disappointed.  In fact, you will be elated that you visited them.  As a side note, as we were leaving, we started to see the line forming.  I recommend getting here early!!"}
{"text":"Huge huge plates and alot of choices, no joke. Their pumpkin bread is amazingly awesome. Really. Don't go for the other options of bread. They're just trying to fool you. Get the pumpkin bread. You can thank me later. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, nice atmosphere, phenomenal service, family owned, definitely deserving of 5 stars! Try the pumpkin bread!"}
{"text":"Where fat people go to die. This place may be a future heart attack for many, but boy was it delicious. I got the hash with the banana bread. This place is the perfect hangover cure, but warning: don't eat before long drives. The calories will put you asleep.  Quality: 5 stars Price:  5 stars Service: 4 stars (it gets packed)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Vegas if you want great breakfast off the strip. It's in the back of a shopping center so it's kinda hidden. The menu selection is big. Most plates come with banana or pumpkin bread. I liked the banana, but the pumpkin was too spicy for me. Not a big fan of pumpkin anyway. Their omelettes come with 6 eggs, if you want half order they reduce $1. The restaurant is dated but looked clean. Not a big fan of carpet in restaurants because it can get dingy like the one here. Took half my omelette to the hotel. You get a whole day's meal here."}
{"text":"Price is good, the omelette dishes are huge you won't leave hungry I won't eat till dinner the place is always packed with people. Great service"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! Fantastic, we're just visiting ya'lls town and we stoped in here from some grub, and they definitely delivered. Food was fresh and delicious. Me and my family are picky eaters. They had something for everyone. Portions are huge, hell we boxed left overs for the road. Ya'all can't go wrong with this place! Mmm Mmm Mmmmmmmm!!"}
{"text":"Large portions, friendly and fast service, constant coffee refills, and easy payments. Would totally go back if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"Everything was good. No waiting to be seated quick fast service. I had the  Mexican egg omelet add the spinach. Even though the potatoe spuds were good it wasn't a fit for breakfast."}
{"text":"Seriously I'm not sure why this place has such a high rating... It's in a really weird part of town. I ordered an omelette with a cup of coffee. The omelette was okay but the potatoes that came with it were really good instead of them being regular shredded hashbrowns they were actually like potato chips. The cup of coffee however was probably the worst cup of coffee I've ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"Started my meal off with a steaming pumpkin bread and coffee that never went cold.  Great service and good food.  Reminds me off the classic diners and yesterday.  Thank you Omelette House."}
{"text":"They seated us and then forgot us. Coffee was very weak with no flavor. Food was just so so. The one true stand out were the potatoes.  Those were 5 stars. I live in vegas but will never eat here again. Our waitress was awesome. Sadly I don't remember her name. Go down the street to the Egg and I. Much better food for a better price."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this seemingly hidden gem of Vegas. The decor is a little busy, but the staff was overly attentive and friendly. The food tasted great and the portion was enough for two meals, HUGE! They even serve your meal with homemade potato chips."}
{"text":"There aren't many times that I say that a restaurant is all that it should or could be, but this time I am constrained to do so. This place is on fire! Food - 5  Quality service- 5  Ambiance- 5 Parking and extras -5 Lookout for the calories here as they are going to come at you have d and fast...! Almost as fast as you taste buds will run about trying to figure out what to do with each bite!  shout out to Kate for a great job serving us!  Shout out for their support of our military!"}
{"text":"I loved this old school, out of the way, at the back of a strip mall, been around for ever breakfast joint.  The decor is what you would expect for a place that has seen many many moons in Vegas, the interior doesn't change and the knick knacks and photos just keep piling up.   What I like in a breakfast spot, lot's of choices, a little grease, and great tasting grub. This place has all of the above.   I had 2 eggs with corned beef hash, the hash is homemade!, yep and oh so good. My husband had the lobster bennie, and they did not skimp on the lobster, another delight. The spuds are like fried potato chips - loved them. Last but not least the banana bread, yum!  Definitely worth a trip off the strip."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Prices are low and servings are huge.  Lots of choices and the service is prompt."}
{"text":"sooooooo much food, but this is a local spot we hit everytime we are in Vegas.  Forget about the breakfast buffets at the casinos, three people could share one meal at this place.  The staff has been there forever and they also hire young high schoolers and teach them the ropes about customer service.  Two thumbs up for this place"}
{"text":"This food was awesome! the potato chips that came with my omelet were awesome too!!!! I didn't finish my omelet but it was just as good the next morning."}
{"text":"Decent hearty breakfast choices.  The best part is the pumpkin nut bread that comes out warm and yummy.  I had the scramble with the potato chips, the chips were very salty and over seasoned.  The wait was a bit long and the coffee a bit watered down but overall a good breakfast place.  It's old school and a total local's joint.  Sadly our first choice down the street recently burned down so we gave this place a try based on Yelp reviews.  If you want something different and away from the strip this place will satisfy."}
{"text":"The best pumpkin bread I've ever had! All the omelettes come with a bread and some homemade potato fries (which are a little over seasoned for me, but still good with ketchup). Friendly service and a nice big open area which makes it a great place for big groups. The omelettes are a little too big for me, so I usually take half home and have a delicious breakfast for the next day."}
{"text":"My hubby and I came in for a breakfast date in this cold, rainy morning and had a wonderful breakfast. He had the chili omlet which is soooo good. I had the french toast special and it was delicious. We love coming to this Henderson restaurant! Sjuana (pronounced like Shawna) is such a nice, pleasant waitress. She is friendly to everyone without being fake. I am happy that we had the pleasure of her being our waitress."}
{"text":"An amazing place for breakfast. Tucked away in the back of a u-shaped shopping center, it's a good thing the large sign was out on the street. Don't be put off by the outside of the building. Go on in and transport yourself back a few years. The place is huge and just goes on and on. We ordered the omelet to share (at the suggestion of Kathy, our server). She was outstanding! The omelet was made with SIX eggs and was cooked perfectly. There is a small charge for splitting the plate but it's worth it to each get your own side of potatoes (think homemade potato chips) and a side of bread. I had the sourdough toast and she had the pumpkin bread. The pumpkin bread was a large thick piece that she loved. The next time we visit Vegas, we will definitely have breakfast here at least once."}
{"text":"No brainer really, nice decor, nice people, terrible omelette and average service.  Bad coffee, fake cream. On a positive note the pancakes were good. When you make an omelette the cheese shouldn't be the only flavor.  No seasoning on anything.  Vegetables are all watery and flavorless, and cooked into an omelette that is so diluted in order to make it fluffy it has no flavor.  IHOP makes an omelette that is 10x better than this one.  Ironic I guess.  By the way there is nothing healthy about this breakfast, more carbs than anyone should eat.   I wasn't looking for healthy, I was hoping for good and hardy."}
{"text":"I started my morning by Yelping Breakfast spots to celebrate my hunny's birthday. We were looking for a place that locals and yelpers rave about. They say this place is a gem. Once we arrived we weren't impressed by the appearance of the outside but it was 12pm and we hadn't had breakfast. Once inside we were seated within a few minutes, the host was nice. We asked for a baby chair BUT the helper brought us a high chair when u can clearly see that we had a newborn, we asked him if they had a baby chair, he was pretty rude and reluctantly brought us a baby chair. Our waitress finally arrived and she looked frazzled. She told us 5x that she would be back to take our order, we saw her walking back and forth and not making eye contact with us but she keeped saying \"I'll be back\"  finally she takes our order, & then brings back our food but my order was the ham benidict  when I had ordered the lobster Benedict, I was pretty disappointed, my tummy wanted lobster. We heard the manager talking to the table next to us, apparently our waitress didn't bring take down their order correctly and didn't bring out all their plates. We felt bad for her and cut her some slack, about 10 mins later it seems like everyone left and we had the restaurant to ourselves. Our waitress came over and apologized, she looked a lot more relaxed. Understandable that in the chaos she lost her head. It took alil bit  away from our experience, but all in all everyone enjoyed their plates."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a local. It's a little run down and the old \"country\" feel is a bit over done but, if you are looking for a local \"greasy spoon\", this is your place. I think there must be a police station near by, 'cause there were a lot of cops in there. If you are looking for HUGE portions, come on in, their normal omelets are SIX eggs. They also have a light weight portion of three eggs. We shared the King of Hearts. It was very good. The wait staff could over all use a little re-training and I, personally, would appreciate it if they had \"brewed\" iced tea instead of that Nestea stuff. Overall, it was good and I would venture back, if I was near by."}
{"text":"Came in for an early afternoon coffee wake-up and a greasy, starchy, gut-coating, belt-loosening, breakfast after yet another very late night tiki-bender consisting of multiple 4-skullers at Frankie's.  Upon removal of my cheap sunglasses, I notice the \"Specials\" board. Chicken Fried Steak Omelet? Yeah, this is happening.  Seated immediately by the friendliest hostess in town! Coffee was good, the cup was never empty thanks to the outstanding service.  The omelet was huge! Actual chunks of chicken fried steak in an omelet that had to have a half dozen eggs in it and, smothered in a country gravy-like substance to boot!  Damn the triglycerides, I'm finishing it!  The potatoes were chip sliced, kinda funky, not terrible. Very uh, potatoey.  I can't believed i finished it all. Pretty gosh-darn good. I'm sure I will be back sometime."}
{"text":"The food presentation is not that impressive. There is a lot James Dean, Elvis and Marilyn Monroe chotskies, which makes it look like a diner instead of a breakfast place. No designated hostess, 2 registers, yet no one seems to know what is going on. Front of house management.....well, what FOH management?"}
{"text":"Service great.  Banana bread awesome.  We had a big group so tried lots of items.  Good but more for those who care about big portion size than quality."}
{"text":"Extremely LARGE portion sizes. Split your order or prepare for leftovers. Omelette was delicious, I did not care for the potatoes so I'll try a different one next time. I absolutely love their banana bread which came with omelet at no extra charge.  Interior was once a old country kitchen restaurant but now it is a Mexican/American breakfast restaurant, so the motif is a little strange."}
{"text":"Wow! they have over 30 different omelets! Food was ok quality, typical diner food. What sold us was the friendly and fast service we received from all of the lovely ladies that worked here, they worked as a team to take care of each table, probably the nicest staff in Las Vegas! Five stars for amazing service"}
{"text":"What a refreshing change of pace. Have car, will travel and find more interesting food. The Omelet House reminded me of some of my favorite diners. Little hole-in-the-wall places that have been doing their thing for decades. Long list of omelets with silly names and unapologetically dated d√©cor with knotty pine walls. Not far from the glitz of the Strip, we found people of all ages from bikers to college kids tucking into piles of food. It felt like a glimpse of the real Vegas.  Their standard 'O-Boy Omelets' are made with SIX EGGS! Totally insane. We ordered 'Baby Omelets' made with three eggs for a little bit less money since there is no point having leftovers when you're on vacation. For choice of bread, my favorite was the pumpkin bread served piping hot. The thinly sliced side of potatoes were on the verge of being potato chips and just as addictive.  I enjoyed The Guac, but had plate envy after I tasted Mr. K's Cowboy Special (chili, cheese and onions) and kept going back for more. This isn't the best place in the world, but I am tempted to give it five stars because it is just what the doctor ordered. But, the coffee is weak (even though the refills were plentiful) and I've had better versions of this style of cooking elsewhere. Still, damn fine."}
{"text":"The hype was spot on. Visited the Omelet House on a nice Sunday morning, what a great treat! Awesome service, fair pricing and most importantly a solid breakfast. My French toast was perfect and my table mates loved their meals. Heads up, their normal size omelets are 6 eggs! Huge! Do yourself a favor and leave the strip. Short ride to a nice local joint!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food was fantastic! Servings are very large, we could have shared. The coffee was very weak but when I told the waitress she made a fresh pot double strength, which was perfect! We are definitely coming back next time we're in Henderson"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Omelets are huge and the potato chip home fries are the best! Service is great always around to refill your coffee. We're going back before we leave Vegas!"}
{"text":"We first came here a few months ago, and we've probably been here half a dozen times since then. My bf frequently teases me over my enjoyment of breakfast foods, and this place is no exception. I've tried several of their dishes- french toast, omelettes, pancakes... none of them have disappointed. Their drinks are good, too. My bf fell in love with their chili verdes skillet and has never varied. And their portion sizes are great- we both brought home enough in our Tupperware (we're trying to go green, so we brought our own) for 2nd meals today. But my absolute favorite is their bread- when you go, make sure you get either their banana nut bread or their pumpkin bread- I sometimes bring pieces home with me for later treats  :)"}
{"text":"WOW! How have I not heard of this place sooner? I've lived nearby for over 7 years and did not know about this place. I am giving it five stars based on food and service alone. The place needs a makeover and the clientele was typical to \"Boulder Hwy\". I ordered the Californian omelette with egg whites and substituted the jack cheese for cheddar. My daughter ordered the corn beed hash. I give both a ten. The omelette was huge and I shared it with my younger daughter. I am still full after splitting a meal 7 hours later. The pumpkin bread was so good! The corn beef hash was the best I have ever tasted and you could tell it was fresh. The potatoes are outstanding as everyone else has stated. The server was friendly and attentive. Our bill for three people with drinks was less than $25. IHOP would be so much more and not nearly as enjoyable. I highly recommend this place and will be returning next weekend for sure!"}
{"text":"Omg Absolutely delicious! Opt for the banana or pumpkin bread instead of toast same price and soo worth it! This will now be a stop every trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Such a great place for breakfast. Make sure you come hungry, though, because the portions are large. Service was good--very attentive to refills, etc. Easy to find, good location. Menu has over 30 kinds of omelets, but I opted for my favorite: eggs Benedict. They didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"On a road trip with the family and we decided to stop here based off reviews! It did not disappoint at all from great service to great food! Thank you Jill who was our server, she made sure everything was running smoothly. No complaints here! The banana bread was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"So good! Friendly service. Omelets are huge, enough for two. Sliced potatoes are great, especially if you ask for them well done (crispier, almost like chips). Pumpkin bread is a must. They seemed to have fixed the weird smell near the bathroom to salad bar area, so yay!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast value!!! Huge portions & delicious! Definitely a regular drop in whenever in town. Coffee is awesome & the service of Cathy, our waitress, was second to none. Get off the strip & get some good old fashioned, unpretentious food!"}
{"text":"Amazing omlettes, HUGE portions, friendly (but not necessarily fast)service.  The potato things they serve with all the breakfasts are the best part of everything.  Yes, the chicken coop motif in the middle of the place is a tad freaky, but you don't go there for the decor.   I bring all my out-of-town friends here, or the Henderson location for super good food before heading out for a day of sight seeing.  (Oh, and do yourself a favor and order a \"baby\" omlette - no one can finish a regular sized one on their own!)"}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can I even say that?  I can't believe they have places like this to eat anymore.  I had ordered the corn beef has and eggs, and it came with the BEST home fries I have ever tasted in my life!    This place is not for you to eat at if you are on a diet.  Our waitress was so polite and the entire staff for that matter.  But she did something that has never happened me to before at restaurant. I LOVE zucchini sticks, and on their menu they claim they have the best one in town.  I was joking with her if they could just make one stick for me to try since I was so full from my breakfast, and with in 2 minutes she came out with one fried sick WHAAAAAAT?  I LOVED IT!  If they had a place like this in Tucson I would be eating there everyday!"}
{"text":"Lost star for bad service. Another for mediocre food and last for not being very clean.  Needs a complete renovation imo."}
{"text":"Holy cow. The worst coffee in, LV? The West? The country? For a breakfast spot?!?  Got french toast. Two slices of white bread.  Came with the home made cornbread - Ok, that's a star on it's own. It was inspirational. I now want to cook more cornbread, just thinking of it.   The service sucked that star away though.   My friend ordered some crazy lobster benedict, with, I wanna say, avocado? He said he was expecting it to be rich, and it was, but that he wasn't happy he ate it afterwards.   Instead of home fries or hash browns, they insist you eat their crunchy fried chips. That was a fail."}
{"text":"I've been eating here sine the 80s as a kid, one of the best breakfast places ever. If its still open and busy then that tells you something! Nuff said"}
{"text":"Wow one of the best breakfast in town. An the service WOW! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp, we decided to give this place a try. When you arrive, the place looks a but run down and ghetto-ish. But don't the outside fool you! The staff inside are super friendly and nice! We ordered a Flap special for our 2 kids to share. The waitress had the kitchen split it between two plates and they made the paclncakes into Mikey Mouse and our kids were so happy their food arrived! We also ordered the corned beef hash which is made from scratch and the chili Verde omelette. Both came with a choice of either homemade pumpkin or banana bread. I personally liked the banana bread over the strong cinnamon flavored pumpkin bread. Both also came with potato chips. The portions are large enough for two people to share, which is something we should've done. But overall, very satisfied with this place."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, with huge portions and a menu to fit anyone's taste buds.  A+ in my book."}
{"text":"I could condense my review into four simple words, to be honest -  Get. The. Pumpkin. Bread.  I'm ashamed to say that I can't even remember what I'd had here.  (The pictures tell me chicken fried steak and eggs.  Not bad, now that I remember.  Pretty good, actually.)  The fries stood out because they were sort of almost like potato chips (not necessarily a bad thing) - but otherwise, it was decent, good breakfast food with nothing else that was truly a standout.  Except for that pumpkin bread.  Oh...em... effing.... GEE.  That pumpkin bread was hot, steaming, with butter slathered on the top... I can't even use any word in the English language to describe the utter deliciousness.  If I'd had my choice, I could have simply eaten that alone for breakfast and I would have been just fine with that.  Completely fine with that.    My husband had the banana nut bread and he said that it was just as good as the pumpkin - maybe even better.  When we come back here, I'll make sure to find out and report back, heh.  If you get Julie as your server, you'll be completely and totally happy.  She was the sweetest lady with a heart of gold.  Totally deserved that extra tip we laid down.    The decor was very countrified, paneled walls, dark and \"homey\".  No complaints here - I thought it was charming and suited the place very well.  No wait, but we came sort of late in the day (after 11:00am).  One star off, though, for the coffee.  The coffee was... in a word... abominable.  But that pumpkin bread completely makes up for it.    I think that we could have been served warm cat excrement and had a server straight out of Dick's Last Resort on the Strip and it wouldn't have mattered, as long as I could have that pumpkin bread.  Did I mention the pumpkin bread was AWESOME?  Oh, I did, then.    Not a bad spot to stop in for breakfast.  It's not the absolute #1 choice (you want Mr. Mama's or Kailyn's Kitchen for that)... but it's worthy.  Especially for that....oh, well, you know.  :)"}
{"text":"On our trip to Vegas, we were looking for a local place to eat breakfast and found this place on yelp. It's in a strip mall and not fancy but homey. The breakfast cooked fresh and the portions are big. The service was excellent. If you are looking for a place to eat good breakfast off the strip, this is the place."}
{"text":"If you are hungry and want a great breakfast you have to come here .. One of the best places in town .. You won't go away hungry ... Their food will satisfy !!! Only open for breakfast and lunch so don't wait to late to come try this place"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in town other than my house ... Have been here many times .. The food is always excellent as well the service .. There is a lil bit of a wait early mornings but it's worth it"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas. I always find myself ordering the monster omelet called the \"Kitchen Sink\". This omelet has everything you can think of meat wise in it. This hulking omelet is the size of three regular sized omelets. I am always prepared to take home at least half of the omelet to eat for a second meal. The \"Kitchen Sink\" offers a great value and extreme flavors and is well worth the purchase. You won't be disappointed! The wait here can be long depending on the time of day. They seem very efficient and the waiting period never seems to be too long. The staff offers friendly service with a smile!"}
{"text":"In Vegas and wanted a good breakfast, yelped this place and it did not disappoint.  I ordered the chili verde omelet, the portions are huge. It was tasty and very generous with the amount of meat, not spicy, but that's ok. My husband loves chicken fried steak, and he said this was one of the better CFS he's had. The gravy was very good. Now the service was great. We had Shirley and she was so cute, made me miss my grandma. Even though she was older she was quick, attentive, and talkative at the same time.  We were able to walk in get seated but do be prepared for a wait if you go on a weekend. The location is a little sketchy, but it turned out ok."}
{"text":"Food was great ! Service  not  so great ,our waitress Megan took a long time to acknowledge us she finally stopped talking to her co-workers and took our order I asked a question and she was rude like I'm supposed to know what a Spud is"}
{"text":"Great place if you want an order of six omletes and bunch of stuffing.  Their signature patotoes was fantastic and service was great. It is a great place to check out but did not work for me."}
{"text":"The waitstaff where amazing and the food was outstanding.This is are first time . Eba  was an amazing waitress and very attentive we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Was my first day here , my mother in law brought me here for my bday , wasn't super excited where I was going and I am not a big fan of omelet or should I say I didn't like them at all .! But once I order and received my food and actually tried it ! It was super super bomb !!!!!!!!!! I will definitely be coming back !!!! And those potatoes were super good , perfect combination ! !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had an omelet and it was cooked perfectly. It was still slightly soft and not at all dried out. The wait was long because there was a lot of people."}
{"text":"The menu doesn't lie, the best corn beef hash I've ever had. The service was exceptional, they run a smoothly oiled machine. Very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Old school with excellent service and food!! Thank you for being open on the 4th of July.  BB&C was excellent along with the banana nut muffin."}
{"text":"I love the Charleston location.  I am not as impressed with this location.  While it is close to my house, thus available for breakfast on the weekends, I have say that the quality of food is not quite there, nor is the level of service.  Maybe I will give them a try again in the future, but there are so many places to get breakfast, they need to step up their game."}
{"text":"My mother was in town visiting and i wanted to try something different from my typical breakfast place i normally go to,  so i did a Google search and found this place. I'm a vegetarian so i looked at the menu prior to going,  and the selection looked good and BONUS!  At the bottom of their online menu it said that you get a free entree on your birthday,  and it was my birthday (I.D.in hand in case they asked) so we went!  It took a few minutes of us standing at the door to be acknowledged or sat.  However, the gentleman that  ended up seating us was very friendly and likeable. That's about the only positive thing i have to say.   Our server greeted us relatively quickly and seemed sweet. We ordered water and when she asked us to order we informed her we had never been there a needed just another couple of minutes to make our final selections. At least 15 minutes passed and she still hadn't come back.  As i was getting ready to go to the ladie's room,  she popped out of nowhere and we ordered. Appetizer: we ordered fried zucchini with cheese dipping sauce and ranch. Took a while for it to come out,  but tasted pretty good. I had a veggie omelet and my mom had a Denver omelet.  The omelets were HUGE,  and were decent at best. Nothing to write home about.  They were served with what looked and tasted like undercooked,  homemade potato chips. Still kind of raw, very greasy, and tasteless. The waitress dropped the bill and i politely mentioned again the it was my birthday and inquired about the free birthday entree. She said,  \"oh, we don't do that anymore,  our  website isn't up-to-date\". She even mentioned that it still had old (cheaper) pricing on the items and a lady came in with not enough money to pay her bill because she looked at it, too. She then told me that she would go ask the manager. 10 minutes later she came back and said \"I'm sorry,  he said no\". Are you freaking kidding me?! Aside from not honoring something they are still advertising,  he didn't even have the decency to come to the table and tell us no, himself? He made the waitress do it?! She then informed me that her dad is one of the owners and that she told him what was going on and he said he will take it off the menu asap.  They just lost 2 potential life-long customers over a 10 dollar omelet and an m.i.a. manager."}
{"text":"Courteous and adorable staff. Had a wonderful lunch there. I've been coming here for many years but this time felt I should give credit where credit is due. Food tastes great and again the staff is so sweet. Haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten at this place for breakfast. Its a solid place for Omelets, hence the name.   They give you a ton of of food and don't skimp on the fillings. If you are super hungry/hung over this is a great spot to hit up."}
{"text":"Big improvement omelet was huge and yummy. Waitress was really nice food came fast I'm so happy"}
{"text":"Side of them fried potato chip/fries???  Addicting!  Banana nut bread served warm w/ a side of butter??? Amazing!  The portion is large enough to eat some as a appetizer and save the rest as a dessert!  Haha!  Lobster Eggs Benedict??? OUTRAGEOUS!!!  It had an abundance of lobster bits and slices of avocado; so good!  Their portions here are fairly large and filling, but like a savage, I finished it all!  It's that good!"}
{"text":"This is our brunch stop before we return to the Bay Area.  Arrived on Sunday at around 10am, the place is packed with a wait line, but the wait was shorter than I expected. After around 15min, we were sat at one of the spacious booth.   Ordered: Lobster Fest: come with real lobster meat and avocado The Sparticus: asparagus, mushroom, cheddar cheese Tried out their pumpkin bread and the banana bread instead of regular toast. Also ordered one hot chocolate and a side order of one pancake.  They served the two pieces of bread first. Both were moist and tasty, but the banana bread to me was a little bit too sweet, whereas the pumpkin one had just the right amount of sweetness to it. If you have a sweet tooth or like banana flavored, definitely go with the banana bread. You just can't go wrong choosing their bread instead of the regular toast offered at any diner.  Both omelet came with a generous serving of \"spuds\", which were freshly cut potato chips. They were crispy and very tasty, but since chips were easier to carry to go and much easier to consume on the road, we saved most of the chips for our way home. We knew before we ordered that the omelets would be big, so we ordered two for the three of us to share. And indeed, even between the three of us, we couldn't finish the two omelets. The lobster fest was pretty good, and did indeed come with real lobster. But what I liked was the sparticus, the asparagus invention was a surprisingly tasty, and somewhat healthier version. (I say somewhat because the portion is too generous to be called healthy!)  Another plus: they offer you one free refill for the hot chocolate! Yes, it still won't compare to the unlimited refill for the coffee, but this is the first time I've ever seen a restaurant offer refill for hot chocolate, so color me happy!  Overall a great meal, very friendly staff, easy location. The spuds were still crispy enough after a 9hr drive, and with a little bit of reheating (I recommend baking instead of microwave) back at home, tastier than ever.  If I'm back in LV, I'll definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"It's like breakfast for the RAT PACK crowd!  And that ain't bad at all!  Omelet House here is ol' skool cool.  Not to mention it's by the historic neighborhood of old Las Vegas, right near Alta where all the celebrities used to live back in the day!  If these walls could talk!  Just imagine the stories!  Located in an older strip mall just off of Charleston, Omelet House is ready to mix up a serving of nostalgia for you.  I mean, the place just oozes the past!  Kitschy items all throughout, down to the smell of days past!  Thankfully, the food is great!  I work near here and never really been in the restaurant until my wife took me one day.  She and her co-workers often frequent here for staff meetings or get-togethers.  The food here?  Some excellent, stick-to-your-ribs, no frills, no apologies...hearty EATS!  If you leave Omelet House hungry that is your own fault.  I'm a big dude and I didn't finish all my breakfast!  Cold leftovers for later, lovin' it.  Wifey and I ordered:  *Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs *\"The Sparticus\" omelet - dubbed the Kirk Douglas special, has asparagus, mushrooms, cheddar cheese & special cheese sauce on the side  Each breakfast plate is served with Spuds (kinda like potato chips but thicker), and your choice of toast, English muffin, tortillas, Homemade Pumpkin Nut Bread or Banana Nut Bread.  We chose one of each - Pumpkin Nut Bread and Banana Nut Bread.  Food didn't take too long to come from the kitchen, maybe about 20 minutes.  Big portions!  Food was warm, and more importantly - TASTY.  Those dang spuds were delightfully addictive.  Yummy with a splash of hot sauce and a dip of ketchup!  Wifey's Chicken Fried Steak was cooked well and smothered with some delicious gravy!  So so so rich.  The Sparticus omelet was great too, full of fresh asparagus and mushrooms & lots of cheddar cheese.  The side of special cheese sauce was totally unnecessary so I didn't much bother with it except to dip my spuds!    The Pumpkin Nut Bread and the Banana Nut Bread were good but on the dry side, my only other complaint was that they tasted somewhat similar.  I love banana bread so I was hoping for more of a banana taste.  The coffee is good & strong and just kept coming.  The service was excellent as well.  No complaints overall, unless you want me to count calories.  Great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I was torn between 3 and 4 stars. The banana bread was fantastic! The potatoes were unbelievable. BUT, my omelet tasted ok but sat in a puddle of oil/grease so I was only willing to eat the edges that weren't soaking in a puddle. It lost stars there. The staff was really friendly and I was lucky enough to be sitting by a kind spirit who ran my wallet out to us in the parking lot after I dropped it inside."}
{"text":"On my last day in Las Vegas I wanted to find a local family restaurant. I'm a huge Omelet fan and found this place before heading back to California.  I was not disappointed at all haha this place was delicious! The portions were huge and the service was excellent. If you're in Las Vegas and an Omelet fan I recommend this place! I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a brunch. Best omelettes, ambience and service. I am definitely coming here when I come to Vegas again: :)"}
{"text":"We were headed out back to Socal, this placed happened to be on our path and had a good name. It's pretty straight forward nothing outstanding. The service was good, nothing to complain about rhere. They offer a mocha iced coffee with whipped cream, don't get it, it's not as good as it sounds at all. My overall experience was satisfactory, I wouldn't exactly tell someone to make it a point to wat here, but if you're hungry and near this place its okay."}
{"text":"The staff is very nice. The omelettes come with homemade chips that would be better with lunch items."}
{"text":"They have the most amazing warm, freshly baked, and melt in your mouth good pumpkin bread! I would come back just for the bread! I had the kitchen sink omelette which came with chili, cheese, green bell pepper, bfast sausage, hot dog, chicken, and mushrooms. At least that's everything I can recall. The omelette is a large portion and fed two people with a little left over. The potato chips are great once served to you eat them up bc they have the balance of crispy and soft! They eventually get kind of soggy.. But I still think they were the best I've had! I'll definitely be back and will be sharing the good news with others to come try omelet house!"}
{"text":"best breakfast in vegas. excellent omelets!! A must for ALL breakfast lovers. But I'm sure the rest of the menu is just as GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Massive amounts of food, amazing prices, and friendly staff. My husband and I can share a meal with each other and our 3 year old!"}
{"text":"Portions sizes were huge and food was great. Definitely a good choice to have breakfast here. I ordered the Corn Beef Hash and it was the best I've ever had. Fianc√© had the stuffed French toast and some omelette, needless to say she devoured what she could."}
{"text":"My son and I decided to go here for breakfast after reading the reviews.  I'd give this restaurant a definite 4.5. The waitresses are very friendly. The place does not try to be too trendy it keeps its decor from the 80's. The omlettes are very large and tasty,  I just wish they had some with a few more ingredients (most omlettes only have 2 or 3 items in them). The potatoes are to die for, they are thin sliced and crispy but not too greasy. The pumkin bread is the best way to go for the bread choice and its served with whipped butter."}
{"text":"What can I say I just recently decided to try this breakfast restaurant now and I am so disappointed it took us eight years to finally try this place out.  This is by far my wife and I favorite place to get omelettes. The lobster omelette is one of the best items on the menu and I highly recommend it to anybody going over there for the first time. Corn beef hash is also phenomenal one of my favorite items."}
{"text":"Is it even Sunday morning if you're not out to breakfast?  I didn't think so.  We originally wanted to go to Kitchen Table because its close to my place and I heard nothing but good things, unfortunately we got there and there was an hour and a half wait. My heart said stay but my tummy said go, so off we went.  We happened upon this little road side gem and i am going to be honest this place looks like the type of place you stop in the middle of no where at a truck stop to grab a bite to eat before hitting the road. I was weary to say the least.  We got seated right away and the food was fantastic! I had Corned Beef hash and it was actually true corned beef. I was very impressed. The only reason for 4 stars instead of five is that instead of hash browns they give you those weird potato chip type things. Is that becoming a thing? I really don't want that to become a thing because ewe.  Friendly, quick service and great food! This was a Sunday win for sure!  **They have an Omelet on the menu that sells for $69.00 and it has raw liver, Grunion lips (when in season of course) Petunia petals, mint chocolate chip ice cream among a few other strange ingredients. If anyone orders this omelet, please, send pictures.**"}
{"text":"I enjoy lunch with my mom at this restaurant which felt old skool fashion style. Food was excellent, the server Jennifer was super nice! I had a burger with spinach and the special chips they serve with the meal. My mom did enjoy her egg salad sandwich. I would of gave 5 stars, but they made a mistake on my order. I will come back again.   Side note the restroom was not to clean."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Vegas that's the first breakfast stop. I've been enjoy thier cuisine for at least 20 years, right after they opened. 5 *****+"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, we usually come here when we're in Vegas. The omelettes are amazing, customer service is great and our complete experience is always a good one.."}
{"text":"A solid choice for breakfast. Unless you are in a large group there is never more then a 10 minute wait, even on Sunday morning when the place appears to be packed.  Friendly service, and the pumpkin bread is to die for. There have been times I was tempted to stop in just to buy a piece of the pumpkin bread to go. The omelets are huge, consider sharing if you aren't a heavy eater.   Never had anything other then breakfast so not sure how the lunch food is."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the breakfasts served at the Omelet House that is down the street from this location, on Boulder Highway and Lake Mead. This location is open for lunch and dinner while the other is not, and we were in the area so we decided to stop in for a late lunch/early dinner.  No one was up front when we arrived but a waitress spotted us after a couple minutes and seated us in a large booth. The menu was almost all breakfast foods... Maybe a dozen burgers and sandwiches were offered for lunch/dinner, as well as 5-8 dinners. Both my husband and I felt a bit underwhelmed, and had a hard time finding anything on the menu that really jumped out and said 'Order me!'   I ended up with a tuna sandwich and my husband got the cajun chicken sandwich. Our food came out fairly quickly and was made to order, but was nothing to write home about... I did notice there was a menu for booze which I don't think the other Omelet House serves...   Even though they are open for lunch and dinner, Omelet House is clearly best for breakfast only. I doubt I will be back if it isn't for breakfast."}
{"text":"I seriously eat breakfast here a couple of times a month.  They have a few healthy options.  You can get an egg white omelet half portion.  Sometimes I even manage to force myself to order it.  Usually though, I get the eggs benedict and grub like a lumberjack.  No this place is not trendy.  Your food will not be served on small plates and it will not be innovative.  But what you will get is super huge portions, good food, GREAT coffee which is constantly being refilled and reasonable prices.  This place is a Vegas institution and I love it!  While you may not be a fatty if you skip it, you're a fool if you miss out on the homemade pumpkin bread."}
{"text":"Come with a empty stomach and you probably still won't finish you plate. Order the kitchen sink."}
{"text":"Came here right after I had surgery and was STARVING! We lived right down the street from this location but we've just never had the chance to try it, I have to say I am so impressed with this place we will most likely be back THIS weekend for more. I ordered the eggs benedict and it was REALLY good! Usually I'm a stickler on the ham being real canadian bacon and the sauce being authentic, but it was still REALLY good and full of flavor I had no complaints. Our server was OUTSTANDING! Drink refills before we ever ran out, our food came out in 10 minutes, checked up on us and was very friendly! SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"First time ever going to a restaurant solely dedicated to breakfast foods, and it did not dissappoint. We were seated quickly, and our waitress took every consideration make our stay confortable; our original booth had a few of our members in the sun, so she allowed us to switch to another without hesitation.   The fried zucchini was okay, I felt that it could have used less breading, but it was still good. I ordered the meat lovers omelet (can't remember the name). It was good, but the serving size was a little big.. Nothing wrong with that! Enjoyed the potatoes that came with it, and the banana bread was awesome.   Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is Las Vegas old school and kind of a mainstay for this UMC/downtown area.  Any given morning, you can find blue collar workman, attorneys in suits or simply locals sitting beside one another enjoying breakfast.    Ambiance is outdated, but kind of goes with the old school feel.  Warn carpet, marinated fake leather booths, bad wood paneling about, convention sale like metal chairs, chachkies and trinkets kind of collecting dust all over the walls and for sale in their front entrance display case.  There is an extensive menu of omelets and surely something for everyone's omelet tastes.  Omelets are large and I would said simply OK.  Maybe a touch greasy.  They are served with \"homemade chips\" or you can substitute another side (some at an upcharge).   You also get a bread option with your breakfast.     Waitresses are old school, just like the venue.  Kind, welcoming, low key, local, many have been serving up Las Vegas locals for a very long time.    I like Las Vegas old school, so don't let the 3 stars insinuate that I would not be back, for I would."}

{"text":"You could surely miss this place from the street. You could miss it with the GPS. It's not an assuming building but don't let that deter you. You want breakfast with great service? Come find the Omelet House.  You'll notice that this place is huge. Twice as large on the inside than from the outside. Seated quickly and waited on quickly. Few different servers helping us. A nice woman got me an iced mocha but hinted that it wasn't that great and she'd make another one if I asked. First sip was nothing but lukewarm ice water so I got another one made, sans ice. Not great either but she was super helpful about the whole thing.  We stuck to omelets, didn't come here to eat salad. I got the 38 Special with ham, bacon, sausage and a couple of cheese. That hit the breakfast spot. And then some. And then more. I've learned that any restaurant that ends in \"house\" ain't messin around. These omelettes tasted amazing even as leftovers.   And I just wanted to say, the service was very friendly. The server was extremely nice and attentive. Made us feel welcome, even advocating me to ask for a better Mocha. That says a lot about a place."}
{"text":"I woke from my Venetian slumber hungry and thought where can I get a good AM meal that will not leave me wanting throught the rest of the day. So I Yelped and  the Omlet House was the first to pop up on the radar that wasn't a new kid on the block.    If this were a truck stop the economy would seriously slow down to a crawl.  This is the real deal. A local big boy breakfast establishment that has been dishing out the goods for almost 35 years.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA?select=x0qFaEDDU9rjoIY0c8WQsw#6zAZ_w1PQ4sThfUhAH2ZLA    You are in Country royalty as Presidents and kings have dined here.  http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2003/Feb-18-Tue-2003/news/20702658.html   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA?select=x0qFaEDDU9rjoIY0c8WQsw#y2tBxR3WW0bxKh_zW0z3ig  This is my kind of family run mom & pop shop.

Next time in Vegas you bet I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience! I could tell upon entering as there was a 15-20 minute wait on an early saturday morning!   The menu is overwhelming with so many options! I came in for brunch and ordered the corn beef hash, the dish was mediocre, as i found the corn beef very inconsistent with the meat size. I'd recommend they work on it a little bit. The fried zucchini, i give that dish a 5, even for a half dish it was plenty to feed about 4 people.  The service is tremendous, staff is on point with refills (coffee/hot chocolate/water) and periodically checked in during the meal.  I was also please to see the manager (featured in the monster pictures of the 3 Lb burger and 12 egg omelet) come by and deliver my meal!  I would definitely go back and try something again."}
{"text":"great omelette's but we waited a little long and I paid too much after finding out that groupon has specials all day for this place"}
{"text":"Wonderful find...The food is tremendous. Chili Verde is flavorful and like home..The Lobster Benedict is one of a kind...This place is a gem in the rough."}
{"text":"Time for possibly the fastest turnaround ever on a review.  Just got home from Omelet House, the Boulder and Russell location. It's just a few minutes from my house, and I was a bit apprehensive because of the mixed reviews. However, when I saw that it was doing brisk business at Sunday brunch hour (11:30), my fears were allayed.  It's the Omelet House, so of course I went straight to the omelet menu. I was almost gonna order the Lobster Fest, but I figured it couldn't have that much authentic lobster if it wasn't $15+. I decided on the Bugsy Siegel (#16) instead, which they say is roast beef  in an Italian red sauce, sour cream, and jack cheese. Within a couple of minutes, our server had brought out my pumpkin bread. While the texture is moist, the flavor is good, not great. When I got to the second half of the bread, I had to use a little bit of butter to offset the growing blandness. I slightly preferred my friend's banana nut bread, which I'm definitely going to have next time I'm here.  My omelet was just good. It was little overdone and a little bland, which are safe things to do at a diner, but you can't excel if you don't take risks. I might ask them to \"undercook\" it by half a minute or something next time and see if they'll consent. Oh, and the omelet really is as huge as they say. I might've been able to finish it had I tried harder, but I spared my belly and took about a third of it to-go. Be ready to do the same, or consider sharing the omelet with a friend.  The fried potato slices (they're all a little too thick and some are not crunchy enough to be called \"chips\") were the real star of the show. They come with some dried parsley (?) flakes and some pepper, and they go well with a little bit of Heinz ketchup. They also add a bit of saltiness to the omelet. I also tried some of the Mexi-Chicken, which killed my sensitive taste buds with jalapeno, and the cinnamon apple stuffed french toast, which was yummy and not at all dwarfed by the syrup.  This is definitely a nice breakfast joint, and for about $9, it's a very good value. Check it out when you're on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Walk in hungry, walk out with a massive food coma.  Omelet House is a local chain with this since-1979 spot near UMC serving as its flagship. After seeing the line when I arrived and the longer out-the-door line when I left, I was thankful that my friends had arrived early to grab a table. Also, the layout is a bit clunky and labyrinthine but I suppose that's part of the old-school charm (along with the framed art and whatnot). I was fortunate that a server noticed my confused wandering and directed me to the rear dining room, where I found the table fairly easily.  Having last been to Omelet House a few years back (around the time during which I penned what would become one of my ROTDs), I forgot just how huge the portions are. Even the baby omelets look hefty, but I got a full-sized #39 Chicken Fried Steak omelet ($11.79) and ended up taking over half of it to-go. The omelet gets a bit dry toward the outside, but jack cheese and sausage gravy more than make up for this. I was a bit confused by my difficulty in locating chicken fried steak and decided that they'd either pounded it unnaturally thin or else used a corned beef paste (a la hash) instead, but the flavors were great overall, with no additional seasoning needed.  Out of the included-with-breakfast-entree sides, pumpkin bread was an easy choice because it had the most seasonal appeal. I did find it a little dry and had to use the vegetable oil spread (no butter, really?), and I think I would've been better served to listen to my old review and order the banana nut bread instead. Also, thick potato chips came with the entree, but they were mostly not crispy enough for my liking. I don't need them as crispy as the mass-produced packaged stuff, but most of the pieces were soft if not soggy  I also had a few pieces of Fried Zucchini ($8.89 full portion) thanks to Christie L. I could've used a more crispy texture on the batter, but I liked the juicy slices of zucchini inside. They weren't overly salty or greasy, and they went well with the dipping sauces (ranch or nacho cheese).  Considering that I did enjoy my overall meal quite a bit, I still have to give a stamp of approval to this location of Omelet House. It's a good value for simple, comforting breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is a well oiled machine! Sunday morning is very busy, but we only waited approximately 15 minutes. Once seated, our food arrived promptly. Portion sizes are big so I ordered a \"baby size\" omelette (regular size is 6 eggs) and I still needed a box. Everyone was so attentive, constant refills of coffee and water, multiple people checking on us, everyone friendly-it was quite pleasant. Food prices are really reasonable! Only $9.99 for a 6 egg omelette  with bread or toast and potatoes. Food arrived hot and was very good. Recommended for family and friends."}
{"text":"I still give you a high rating, although your prime chicken noodle soup - now has a ton of chopped zucchini and very little chicken.  Hope you cut back on so much zucchini because it's more like a vegetable soup now. Pumpkin bread still delish!  Just a note from a long-time loyal customer."}
{"text":"Been coming here for at least 8 years with friends and family.  I love the breakfast here, hubby always get their omelette and I'm partial to the BLT with avocado. Love love love the spuds ;) Always had great service here."}
{"text":"Friendly service from the time you walk in the door until the time you walk out. Large portions of food so you are able to share or bring home and enjoy for a meal or snack later on in the day. Coffee was outstanding not to strong or weak. Lots of flavor in the food, fresh pumpkin and banana nut bread. The potato chips were a nice touch to the omelette I ordered. Will definitely be returning. Thank you for the awesome service from all."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough for this place! The service was amazing and the food was great! Big portions.  Good prices. Def a go to breakfast spot when we come visit again! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I reviewed the yelp site for places to eat and found the Omelet House had some good reviews.  The omelets are super huge with 6 eggs.  You could share your order for a $1.00 more or you can order a smaller portion (not sure how many eggs).  I wished we had known that they use 6 eggs because we couldn't eat that much.   I ordered the lobster eggs benedict and that was delicious.  Their meals come with potatoes which were like potato chips (very good)."}
{"text":"There's a new location up the Boulder Hwy. by Russell just a stone's throw from Sam Boyd Stadium.... It's a beautiful store and the menu is basically the same. YUMMY...they serve dinner too Mon-Sat. OH YEAH!"}
{"text":"Good:  The food is excellent, fast, hot and the portions HUGE.   We love the kitschy and the atmosphere.    Bad (potentially):   Just a precaution... use cash to pay.  I have visited this restaurant twice in a year (I'm not local to Vegas), and there are only two restaurants that we visited each time where we used credit cards to pay, this being one of them - and each time we've visited our cards were skimmed, duplicated and the fraudulent charges started racking up.  We keep our cards in sleeves that protect from random skimming so they had to have been physically skimmed when we paid our bill.  As I said, it was either here OR the other place, I'm dropping this same warning on my review of the other restaurant."}
{"text":"A Must Go!! ..For Breakfast in Las Vegas Must check out best Banana nut bread I've ever had"}
{"text":"Great old fashioned setting, mostly the locals eating here. Good food, friendly service, reasonable prices. Recommend you SHARE an omelet, and definitely get the pumpkin bread."}
{"text":"This place is legit!!! The food is home style, so fresh,  delicious, and affordable. The customer service is top notch too. I'm craving the food there as I type this. I'm definitely coming back to The Omelette House next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best omelette I've ever had!!  Cali club was so good. Portions were so big I couldn't eat it all although I wanted to!  The banana bread cane out warm & reminded me of grandma's. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best hangover places ever. This place has not failed me everytime I'm in town. I love the homey atmosphere, the amazing banana bread, the perfectly crisp potato chips. I remember having a burger there that was good, chicken fried steak that was good, french toast that was good... Omelettes are fucking HUGE and good."}
{"text":"Wow I was shocked that my breakfast experience here was uh! I've been bringing clients and have dined at the Omelet House for years and this was my first unpleasant experience here.   I ordered the chicken fried steak with potatoes, eggs over medium and a biscuit which would normally go good with gravy. The Chicken fried steak was yummy and so was the gravy but what was horrible were the potatoes which were under the chicken fried steak. The potatoes were so greasy I couldn't even eat them. Second complaint was the biscuit which was like a dinner roll!   I confronted the hostess who took the unfinished potatoes and showed the cook. She advised the waitress later bc she wasn't around and she advised me that was is the way their biscuits are made and she also explained she didn't know what happen to the potatoes which are usually crispy. Nothing was offered like new potatoes or even a discount which was shocking.   I still left a minimal tip because I didn't feel it was the waitress's fault but was disapointed with the end result!"}
{"text":"Bomb always. Omelette are amazing and all the staff seem super happy and eager to serve. Had the 38 special so cheesy"}
{"text":"This is in my top 5 favorite breakfast places. The food is always phenomenal and I've never had to wait more than 2 minutes to grab a seat.   Recommendations: - Any of the omelettes - Lobster Benny - Corn Beef Hash  However, do stay away from the smoked salmon omelette. It's a sodium packed nightmare."}
{"text":"All around a great breakfast spot. The banana nut bread was delicious, you have to try it. The lobster omelette was stuffed full of large chunks of lobster and avocado. The portions are large so bring your appetite.   The wait staff was extremely friendly. We never had to ask for a refill on our coffee as all of the servers top you off as they walk by."}
{"text":"I had never been to this Omlete House before I went with 8 of my co-workers for our annual holiday lunch. Given there were so many of us I called ahead to make a reservation. Well, it turns out they don't take reservations. I was told to call back about an hour before we wanted to eat so they would have a heads up. No problem.  We showed up about 11:45 and were led back to an area of the restaurant where tables could be put together for the nine of us. We were led back quite a long way too. It turns out the Omlete House is massive. There must be three or four dining areas. The hallways and corridors wind through like a labyrinth through dozens of antique decorations adorning the walls. Paintings, copper art, knick knacks Coke signs. Some of it is for sale. Some of it is not. It gives a lot to look at while waiting for your food.  The food was good. Some of my co-workers ordered omletes as that is the specialty here. Me personally, I don't care for breakfast so I ordered a pastrami sandwich on marble rye. The pastrami was sliced thick and stacked not super high but high enough to be pleasing. The rye bread was too toasted for my liking and tore up my mouth. But it tasted good enough that it didn't really matter. On the side was the \"famous\" potatoes that I don't actually like. They are almost like chips but not as thin and not as crisp. Potatoes that don't know what they want to be. Not that it made any difference. I ate most of them anyway. What really stood out was the fried zuchinni we ordered for the group. Batter fried rather than breaded and seasoned too. It was delicious. And it came with two dipping sauces. Ranch dressing and cheese sauce. I ate my pieces plain. Still good. I also was given a co-workers pumpkin bread. That might have been my favorite part of lunch. It was moist and loaded with pumpkin spice and topped with walnuts. Fantastic.  This was a good lunch at a cool place with accomodating staff."}
{"text":"Large portions great prices. The food will fill you all day of being satisfied. And to top that all of the serve fresh banana bread before you breakfast with your coffee. A Must eat in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably THE BEST breakfast joint in the Las Vegas area. When in Vegas (twice a year) we always visit this place. Sometimes several times during our holiday. And I think we stand out being European tourist because on several occasions we've had a nice conversation with the owner asking us how we found and like the place.  We'll: we love it! The atmosphere is like you're dining with your crazy aunt that can't stop collection teapots and hasn't change her decor in ages. But that's the fun of it.. You'll find not only teapots, but also cookie jars, muts, salt and peppers, etc. Really nice to look at. And don't forgot the big wall painting.  Service is very, very prompt. Portions are beyond huge. Spuds are to die for. Best we've ever had.  Have to be honoust: although we come here 4-6 times a year we always take an omelet. Most of the times my love orders a 38. meat lovers omelet and I always order some kind of egg white omelet with vegetables and feta. Both a big succes. So can't really tell you something about the dishes besides the 40 somewhat omelet choices. But hey, why go to an omelet house to have a salad?   And remember Intold you the portions are huge. Consider ordering a baby omelet."}
{"text":"I found this awesome hole in the wall from Yelp, thank you very much!  OH GOD IT WAS SO GOOD!!!!  After struggling with what to order, the menu is fantastic, so many really good choices, the people next to me were served.  Let me just say there was absolutely no freaking way I could possibly eat an omelet all by my self, my husband agreed,  we decided to split.  Here's the delicious concoction that arrived.  A very simple green chili, onion, jack cheese omelet, smothered with there verry good hollandaise sauce, they even put the sauce on the potatoes.  I'm talking heaven.  I seriously was having mouth orgasms.  Mmmm, aahhhhhh, I just couldn't stop.  Oh and I forgot to mention the breakfast also came with a choice of breads on of which was pumpkin nut bread, YUM!  They split every thing for us and were just so nice.  How refreshing, Nice waitstaff.  Go figure!  I will definately recommend again and go there when ever I happen to be on my way to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place.  Nothing fancy but the omelette we had was amazing!  We should have shared thy were so big.  Is one of our must go to's when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed... It is worth the cab ride off the strip.. The place appears small, but it can fit many. Everyone (including the owner) lends a hand to sit you quickly and refresh your coffee. The menu is simple the chioces are numerous, and the servings are plentiful... I would even recommend getting the jr omelette for .90 cents less for those who don't eat to much.. They make the banana and pumpkin bread fresh themselves, which looked delightful. Their rendition of hashbrowns is very unique and tasty!  I can't find a single thing bad about this best kept secret, other than I wish there was another near my home...."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by this morning for breakfast. We had read the reviews and we're looking forward to it. We were not mistaken! I ordered the stuffed french toast with apple cinnamon and cheesecake filling, two scrambled eggs and sausage. Portions were gracious - if you do not eat a lot like me, I would opt and share with someone. If not, go there hungry! My husband ordered the petunia pig omelet with bacon and cheddar cheese. He had the option of choosing the banana nut bread or pumpkin bread but he went with the toast. I made a face and the waitress noticed I was upset with his choice of toast! And without me asking her, she brought us a complimentary warm pumpkin bread slice with butter. Service was great! Food was phenomena and VERY filling and prices are VERY affordable."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say. This was our 6th time here, and sadly our last. Must not be in the cards for us to eat out today. Although this place has great food, and we have brought family here for special occasions we were not given the opportunity to eat today.  We were immediately greeted by a busser, brought to a table and brought waters and menus. We decided what we wanted and waited for our waitress. The table across from had great service. Their waitress came to check on them multiple times. A family was seated behind us, and brought their drinks. Another table was then seated in the back room with us. They were brought their drinks and immediately had their order taken. We thought of the three...yes three...waitresses in our room at least one would stop and ask us for our order. We had the menus sitting at the end of the table thinking this was a universal sign saying we were ready. Although one waitress kept looking over at us, no one ever took our order. We could hear some of the waitresses talking and laughing while standing in the back. So disappointing.  The bus boys were working hard, so props to them."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to breakfast out today. Haven't done that in awhile, so this was going to be a treat.  At 8am on Sunday, we walked in right after another couple. At first, the lobby looked rather inviting. It was large, and had the look of an antiques shop with all of the figurines, glasses and other cute things on shelves. Then we noticed the yellow caution 'wet floor' sign in the middle of the floor. It wasn't wet, but they really needed to sweep. Crumbs everywhere. Looked like the floor in a ski town when people walk in with salt on their boots, and it dries.  We watched the couple ahead of us being seated. And then we waited. And waited. No one ever came back, so we left. Would really have liked to try their food, but we were never even seated. Won't be back."}
{"text":"To day is Mothers Day , The restaurant was pretty busy  and The service was very good , I had Yelp them a few days ago . Food Looked Good in pics.  But now you can compare my pics Now ,to ones 9 months ago . Smaller portions more money. The corn beef hash was OK needed flavor in the corn beef plus as you can see compare pictures smaller portions but was OK with me because I really didn't like it. 3 STARS FOR GOOD SERVICE Price Too high $$$$"}
{"text":"This is our go to place after a weekend in Vegas. We hit it on our way back to California. The food is amazing. Their French toast is to die for. The omelets are wonderful and come with a side of potatoes chips that are delicious. The service is always great and wait time isn't usually long at all. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Went here on a Sunday (also Mother's Day) and it was jam-packed. My friend and I decided it was worth the 30 min wait to be seated, and also another 25 for the food. Our waitress did the best she could, but it was clear that the restaurant was a little overwhelmed by all the patrons. One nice thing we noticed was that they brought our side dishes (yummy banana and pumpkin bread) out first and kept on top of our drinks. Food was great and you get huge portions for the price."}
{"text":"Wow!  Wonderful breakfast with exceptional service.  A gem off the Las Vegas strip.  It appears that local and those (like us) who find it on their way home.  Great stop before heading on the long ride home to LA"}

{"text":"This place has a funky eclectic atmosphere and serves up huge, delicious omelets. We ate here twice during our stay. Highly recommend The Californian. Cool local spot."}
{"text":"Let's start with Jose our waiter. He was thorough. Polite. Goes above and beyond. Great service. Thank you Jose.   Decor: old school and pics of movie stars and celebs that have been there. Plus decor that could have come fun my grandmas house (in a good way).   It's Omelet House. But we went rogue and ordered Corned Beef hash  (comes with pumpkin bread) and I had blueberry waffles with a side of whipped cream.   Whipped cream was from a can. And I'm ok with that (I asked before I ordered). Pancakes were delish.   Corned beef hash was A-Maz-Ing. And the pumpkin bread was to die for. (More like a cake)   Coffee was soso. But hot and not burnt or old.   All in all great meal off the strip. And great staff."}
{"text":"Wow! Great customer service. I had the eggs Benedict lobster and it was amazing. Huge pieces of sweet lobster underneath a really great  hollandaise sauce. Also the portion was hugr"}
{"text":"Four star breakfast place bumped to five stars for the great service and the value for your dollar!  Love this place =)"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out for awhile and finally got there.  The service was outstanding.  You can tell that management treated their employees right since everyone worked as a team.  The food was excellent, it came hot to our table, and the banana nut bread was so out of this world that I have to get another order.  I've been in a lot of breakfast places over my life and never had such great service or food ever before.  I would definitely go there the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. They went out of their way to accommodate our large party. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for some breakfast yesterday after driving past this place a million times before.   Love the old diner feeling! The service was great and our food came out fast. They do serve BIG portions so definitely come with an appetite.   This is so much better than the basic IHOP or Denny's."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas this place is a most! Chili verde omelette with a slice of banana bread is pure bliss. I recommend  this place to all my friends that visit the Las Vegas area. That staff there ate A+"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast because of Yelp reviews and we were in the area. The place was packed but we were helped quickly and everyone was so polite and welcomin. Even the young boy outside selling newspaper hopped up when he saw us coming, opened the door, welcomed us, and wished us a great day.  Everyone checked on us throughout our meal, not just the waitress, and were very friendly. The food was delicious and in very large portion. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with bacon. The spuds were a surprise and were slices thin and fried with salt and pepper on top. I loved them! I wouldn't hesitate to come back the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Real diner food. Their navy bean soup was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Flippin' yum!  Spicy huevos rancheros, great service and reasonably priced. A catacomb of a space filled with lots of original kitche. Weekday's are great anytime; lunchtime gets hectic."}

{"text":"Nothing fancy . Very casual down home kinda vibe . The staff is what makes this place . Everyone is friendly and happy . Our waitress Shauna was a sweetheart . Her smile and good vide is infectious . The food is great too . My big boy and I had the corned beef hash with eggs . Very good . My big boy who is a big eater wiped his plate clean in a matter of a few minutes . I had left overs .  Portions are huge . My hubby had the chicken fried steak omelette. He could barely finish his and my 13 year old had the French toast stuffed with apples  eggs and potatoes on the side. He cleaned his plate And picked on hubbys leftovers . My 6 year old had the French toast breakfast which he almost finished and it was a lot of food . My five year old had the Mickey pancakes with chocolate chips and bacon on the side . All the boys want to come back before we leave for LA. By the way , there is a sweet balloon making lady that comes from 9-12. She will create any balloon character you want . My middle boy turned thirteen today and she created a huge bday hat for him.  She had everyone say happy bday to him and embarrassed him like every 13 year old boy should be embarrassed on their bday! Love this place!!"}

{"text":"I believe this place is the best breakfast place in town. it's one of my go-to places when my friends visit an do they always leave a happy customer.  they have every omelet you can think of and they are HUGE! if you can finish that in one sitting then props to you. aside from the omelets they're hash browns are REALLY good. oh and the banana bread... that could be a delicious meal in itself. if you haven't been there try it and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Fantastic old-school wood-paneled breakfast spot in a shitty strip mall, staffed by motherly waitresses serving obesity-epidemic-fueling-sized portions of all the regular brekkie foods.   Order less than you think you'll need...trust me, it will be MORE than enough!  The only bummer with this place is it closes at 3pm...and who the hell is up and about before 3pm in Vegas?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Wonderful throw back Las Vegas Establishment. Everything deeeelish and very generous portions. Start off with the incredible banana nut bread. Mmmmmmmmm! Lots of Vegas memorabilia. So glad we found this place. Thanks Yelp... Again."}
{"text":"I love you omelet house!! Thank you for your delicious zucchini and pumpkin bread. I hope that you are always here when I travel to Las Vegas! Julie you are an AMAZING server. So attentive and kind. Thanks for the great food and service."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday for lunch and the place wasn't busy but it had people coming and going. The portions are huge and I would say reasonable. The service was great ever since we got there. We got seated quickly and our waitress was very attentive through our meal. My coffee mug was never empty. I ordered the eggs Benedict Florentine. It came with a side of things sliced fried or baked..(not sure) potatoes..a big heaping side of potatoes Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I didn't think the food looked great from the pictures, but they have almost any kind of omelet you could possibly make, and they give HUGE servings for extremely reasonable prices! The food was also delicious, and a man came around constantly to make sure that your coffee cup always stayed full. I definitely want to come back and try the lunch and dinner here as well"}
{"text":"It was OK, big portions if that is your thing.  I couldn't get super excited as our server was pretty checked out the whole time but the food was good enough and lots of it."}
{"text":"This is the best homestyle cooking restaurant in Las Vegas. We heard about this place through the Entertainment Book (coupons not accepted on holidays). First of all the inside is Kitsch- it's like Grandma's house, basically. Prices are reasonable- about $10.00 per person. We've been come here for breakfast and lunch- open 7 am to 3 pm daily. The best thing for breakfast is the Eggs Benedict Lobster for $9.89- two  eggs, avocado, chunks of lobster, hollandaise sauce on top of an english muffin. It's heaven! We've had the other omelets but if we come for breakfast,  we always order the Eggs Benedict Lobster- we love it. Lunch is usually burgers (my husband gets the mushroom burger for $7.69- mushrooms, american cheese, lettuce, tomato & 1000 island dressing) or sandwiches- like the Cajun Joe- cajun seasoned chicken, mayo, lettuce and tomato for $7.99  (but there are other things on the menu like salads & chili). Both breakfast and lunch is served with their signature potato, spuds, which is really good (unless you have them soggy, which happened once).   Service is usually very good. This location is like  a tee-pee. Especially crowded on sunday mornings. Local celebs eat here. This is one place I would really recommend to out-of-towners and other locals alike."}
{"text":"Old school breakfasts are definitely my thing.   It is huge inside and super easy to get lost. Lots of weird little kick-knacks to look at. The menu is also large and fun to look at, with even a joke item on the menu. I can't wait to work my way through the variety of omelets. I ended up ordering the Loch Ness Monster, which had shrimp that they did not skimp on. I also enjoy their potato-chip style chips.   The portions are also huge. I know that I keep using the word huge in the review like I am paying $5 per use, but it is true. The staff also have huge hearts. Seriously, super sweet and attentive. When one of our waitresses asked my husband if he liked the coffee drink she made, he took a small moment of hesitation (he was afraid to hurt her feelings) and she forged ahead and whipped up an even better one.   This place is near my doctor's office, so it is soon to be a staple. Get an ultrasound to see a baby and then go get a food baby."}
{"text":"3rd time here. We always come on a weekend after the gym. This place has amazing customer service and military friendly. Great replacement to our weekend trip to pancake house. Banana bread is crazy good!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, the food is amazing. we tried 3 omelet types and all were great. portion is more than enough, Coffee is great (not bold) with free refills. my kids liked the side potatoes (much better than french fries). seating and decoration fits the place and staff are very helpful. The prices is much less than any other place with same quality of food. I am sure I am going to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Old school. Best corned beef hash I've ever had. Great omelets. ... And their pumpkin bread is nothing short of warm perfection!!!  It's plain food. No frills with old school waitresses and ambience. A good place to go when you roll out of bed on a Sunday morning and don't feel like getting dressed up but want a good old-fashioned breakfast."}
{"text":"Omelet House is as  'classic breakfast diner in small town America on a Sunday morning' as you can get. Older female waitresses that call you Honey and remember you by name? Check. Newspaper boy selling papers up front? Check. Older couples who seem like they've dined there every day for the last 10 years? Check.  Sure you can call it old, beaten up and even grimy, but that's what gives it that homey, been there for years, family owned feeling. You can say that waitresses are old or you can appreciate that they know most customers by name and are really dedicated to their job.  The food isn't fancy and there are better places to get breakfast, but if you're looking for a no frills, classic breakfast Omelet House is your place.   The omelets are huge in size and stuffed with their toppings. The potatoes are so crispy they are almost a potato chip. There banana bread is good-however its occasionally over-heated and no longer tastes \"fresh.\"   The Bugsy Siegel was a ton of roast beef dripping in sauce. It was good, but it didn't taste right as an omelet or as a breakfast meal. I would have liked it better in a sandwich and not as my first meal of the day. It has a strong taste and a little too heavy to start the day!   The Mile High City =  Ham, bell pepper and onion. It may not be creative, but its a classic."}
{"text":"Nothing good to say. Omelet was cold dry an tasteless. Had cold chunks if ham n cheese.  Server no where to be found. It's too bad, last time we were here it was great."}
{"text":"I gave The Omelet House 4 stars because the food was great. We got alotthe wife and I could have shared one breakfast. The pumpikin bread was out of this world and I like the homemade chips. My wife had the hashbrowns and said they were perfect. I only have a couple of complaints the first what is we waited 10 minutes before we were seated I noticed there was a lot of empty tables the other complaints what is the coffee was watered down. the wait staff was very pleasant all in all my experience at The Omelet House was very good. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Was touring Vegas and heard this place is a must try and decided to come here. Ordered an omelette and the serving was humongous! I.T was enough to feed two people and I had the king something...sorry bad memories but it's the biggest omelette they have available.   The potato chip was unique and very delicious. Omelette wise is good too! Gotta try I.T in order to critique I.T because I honestly feel this place was worth trying to get a taste of Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food and huge portions.  Waffle was delicious, as was the pumpkin bread.  Service nice too.  A great change from the strip.  Would return anytime."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and reasonably priced (especially in light of the enormous portions). This is about as close as you will get to a NY/NJ type dinner in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Service was good, the banana bread was great.  I had the healthy omelette and was very filling.  Big portions so come hungry.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Tremendous service! Good food and warm people! I think it was my best Banana bread I ever had!!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow.   I'm from California and we don't have ANYTHING compared to Omelet House there. Not only are the prices affordable compared to everything else out there, but the waiters are very nice and attend to you within short notice. Major props to them because they are running around making sure everyone's satisfied.   When it comes to the omelets, they sure do them justice. They have burgers and sandwiches, but people come for the omelets (Cmon, they're called OMELET house for a reason). I had the Rio Grande Surfer (chorizo, cheddar cheese) and it was made to perfection. And don't get me started on the Pumpkin Nut bread, it was fire.   The only con I could possibly think of this place is the wait time to get seats on a busy day but that could be negligible on most occasions.   No doubt this is 5/5 stars. Major key."}
{"text":"Our group of four went for brunch yesterday. This was my first time there and I can't wait to go back - maybe later today. :) We were not only absolutely happy with the food, but  even more impressed with the kind and caring attitudes of every single staff member. I ordered the pumpkin bread with my omelette which was the perfect temperature and was delicious with melted butter. My husband had the chicken fried steak and eggs - yummy! The potatoes were thinly sliced and cooked so some were crunchy - my favorite! I can't imagine not being more than satisfied with a meal from here."}
{"text":"My Fianc√© and I absolutely LOVE IT here! We are from the Northeast (moved in June) so we are no strangers to great diners, but The Omelet House totally crushes it! We were so happy to find out for ourselves that all the great press about this place is true! Great prices for HUGE,delicious portions and friendly, family atmosphere. We have found our Go-To Breakfast Place and recommend it every chance we get!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is really good. The balloon guy on sunday is hilarious and my daughters love him.  Overall it's a great experience."}
{"text":"We just moved right around the corner from this location and it is now our favorite breakfast (and sometimes lunch) spot! We always try to ask for Esaun (sp?) because his service is amazing! He is speedy, kind, and makes sure we are taken care of. Everybody there, from the hostesses to the management, are very friendly and professional.  The food is always fantastic ( we usually go for the Country Benedict) and never inconsistent with taste and quality.   If you are looking for an amazing place to get some breakfast I 100% recommend this location.   Thanks guys! We will probably be there tomorrow because we apparently now live at your restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been eating here since I was little. The portions are big but they offer half size portions. Healthy options all over the menu. I've never been unhappy with what I've gotten here from chicken strips at lunch to an egg white omelette. I've know some of the staff since I was a kid they'd always great."}
{"text":"Still the best breakfast in town. Awesome service! Thanks Kevin for your gracious hospitality!!"}
{"text":"We start (and usually end) every trip to Vegas by coming to this location. My go-to is either the Californian or the Spartacus and my husband loves the Kitchen Sink. Don't waste your time on a side of toast or English muffin, take a chance and live a little by ordering the banana bread! You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"I loved this place all the way from the old school decor to the yummy home cooked breakfast. The place was warm, cozy , clean and the staff was friendly. Anytime I am in town... I will make it a point to stop in."}
{"text":"Great place to have a breakfast or brunch They close at 3 pm  Every time we came to Vegas we stop here not regrets ... If u visit the denis at Vegas Blvd u understand me   Love this place  Just 10 minutes from Vegas strip ."}
{"text":"Great place to have a breakfasts or brunch !! Highly recommended ...it's our 3 th time here since last year ..every time we come to Vegas we eat here ... It's just 10 minutes from Vegas strip .!!! If u tried the Dennis on Vegas boulevard u will love the difference !"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Vegas for breakfast, staff was super awesome and friendly and the coffee is so god too I think we drank 7 cups of coffee each of us and it was a party of 9.... the huevos rancheros with Chile verde was so delicious. This will be our stop for sure everytime we come to Las Vegas.  They seat us right away and I can't forget about their homemade freaking delicious warm banana bread... omg to die for \" trust me\" it's a Must to get"}
{"text":"We took our valet's advice and hit up this local Las Vegas spot. We were served quickly and both enjoyed out delicious omelet's. We will definitely hit it up again next time."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I was in high school (over 25 years), but my meal today was terrible.  Food was cold, stale, and looked like it had sat for awhile.  I think because I came in an hour before closing time, which isn't any excuse!  Also, service was bad.  The cashier asked if everything was good on my way out and I said it was just ok.  She took that as is and didn't even ask if there was any improvements they could make.  I won't return here again."}
{"text":"The Omelet House is my go-to for comfort food.  And the funny thing is, I don't usually go for breakfast!    This visit, I had my lunch favorites:  the Ham & Bean soup with the banana walnut bread and the zucchini with the ranch dressing.  The zucchini is served with your choice of cheese sauce or ranch, and I love the cheese sauce with their spuds or chicken fingers.  But the ranch is best with the zucchini and is in my opinion, the best ranch dressing in Vegas!  I've also gone for breakfast and dinner in the past.  My kids rave about their pancakes and I love all the omelets.  Dinner is good as well.  They have daily specials at the Summerlin location, but I'm not sure they serve dinner in Boulder City.  There are a few locations in town and I've been to all of them.  There is always easy and convenient parking, but be prepared to wait for a table on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"Thanks banana cake was just mind blowing. It is served hot n fresh with butter that melts in your mouth. The service is fast. So if u r getting late n wanna be in and out in 30mins, this is a good place."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon located in the Lake Mead/Boulder Highway area.  The restaurant is reminiscent of a old diner. Breakfast and lunch is served. The prices are very reasonable and on the inexpensive side. The staff is friendly.  I had a Belgian Waffle which was good."}
{"text":"Just make sure you order the.......never mind. Order anything off the menu. It is all delicious. Even down to the simplest of things like their coffee."}
{"text":"I was on my way to the Las Vegas Premium Outlets and used the Yelp app. on my phone to find a good breakfast spot that's not a buffet. This popped up and just based on four stars and one dollar bill sign, I headed over there. It's literally a hole in the wall and when you walk in it looks like a country kitchen. The waitress called me hun and asked if I wanted pumpkin bread, banana bread or toast. I chose pumpkin bread since it's pumpkin season and when she brought it out it was steaming hot!! I ate this with the side of butter and loved it! I ordered the California omelette with avocado, cheese, and sausage and got the baby size. It was huge for one person! It also came with a side of home made potato slices. I ate half the omelette and saved the other half for the drive back to California. Not only was the service great but it was fast! I was in and out of there within 30 minutes.         I don't know why I have to go all the way to Nevada to get a damn good California omelette, but I'm making this a regular stop for all future Vegas trips."}
{"text":"If you love big plates of food in a kitschy ambiance, Omelet Place is definitely your place. There are so many different types of omelets that I was stuck. I told the waitress that I was debating between the lobster omelet and the chile verde omelet. Her decision, let the coin decide! *LOL* So I ended up with a chile verde omelet.http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/9oejaQafFch7vjEiHoCQ4g/l Very good. I could only eat a few bites because I ordered some pumpkin bread with my meal. That bread was piping hot and so flavorful. Hubby had the country fried steak. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/B4JKIvsJHlQu-uVp165kYQ/l  He liked it. It wasn't the most fantastic CFS that he's ever had, but he said it was good.  The staff was extremely nice and the price was just right. It's in North Las Vegas but not that far from the strip.   The other cool thing that they offer is a mini-omelet. It's cheaper too. I totally forgot though."}
{"text":"5 stars for sure! The Omelette House was a hidden gem. Huge portions and enough to split for 2 people. The king of hearts omelette I ordered was delicious! My dad had the short stack of pancakes and loved them.  Our waitress Cece was so nice and we loved chatting with her. This place is the real deal. Authentic and home cooked food! If you're in Vegas come here for breakfast. Worth the drive from the strip :)"}
{"text":"Yum! I've only been here once but when in the area this will definitely be my go to. I was here with a few co-workers for lunch and everyone left pleased. The omelets, chips style potatoes, chicken Philly sandwich, and banana nut muffin were all great!  It's also TONS of food! It was so much food that I had left overs for dinner and couldn't finish them! Ridiculous amount of food.  Now I can't say I was a fan of d√©cor or service but the food definitely made up for it. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"This is the second Omelet House location I've experienced. Came here for brunch with a couple of girlfriends and all of us left with happy bellies. The restaurant has plenty of seating and reminds me of a maze, it has several different rooms/areas. The d√©cor has an old school diner feel to it, cute and cozy. I had their lobster egg benedict with home made potato chips and ALOT of coffee. The lobster benny was pretty good. The potato chips are my favorite, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, YUM! My friends ordered different variations of the omelets and were all pleased.  Omelets come with potato chips and pumpkin/banana nut bread or toast. The restaurant serves up about 40 different omelets, even the pickiest people (I know a few) are bound to find a combination they like. They also offer sandwiches, hamburgers, soups, etc. Solid breakfast, lunch place."}
{"text":"Simple, unpretentious, and old fashioned (the latter in appearance and with menu options). We stopped by the Omelette House with a large group and no one was disappointed. The portions were HUGE, and the food just scrumptious... Several in our group tried some of the omelettes, others pancakes and I went for the French toast. They have just about all of the breakfast classics (as well as creative variations of them) sure to hit the spot."}
{"text":"Breakfast is always a treat here, Mon.-Fri. they have a great special with nice choices.  Weekends can get real busy, especially Sunday Mornings.  The standard Omlettes are made with 6 eggs and are huge! (They have a \"baby\" size of all the Omlettes that are made with 3 eggs)  Skillet breakfasts are good, too."}
{"text":"Read about a great locals breakfast place in Vegas. We stopped in on a Friday morning after our plane landed.  We were seated as soon as we walked in even though they were busy. Wait staff: friendly, attentive and very pleasant.  Food: Lobster Benedict was delicious! Chicken fried steak with eggs was also perfect and tender.  Homemade chips in lieu of hash browns were a welcome change.  We visit Vegas 2-3 times a year and will definitely return next time!  Thanks Omelette House!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a retro dive with huge portions, you must check out this place. The omlets are so big it turns one meal into two"}
{"text":"I was on vacation in Las Vegas, and I wanted a break from the over priced food on the strip so this place was a much needed break. At first I was a little skeptical, but wow this place was delicious and the staff was very friendly! The proportions are huge! I ate the best pancakes I've ever had, no syrup needed. Overall, the next time I'm in Vegas, the Omelet House will be #1 on my list!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat.  Fast, friendly service and delicious food.  We selected the pumpkin nut and banana nut bread w/our dishes, served hot with butter.  My hubby ordered the Lobster Benedict and ate every bit of it.  I ordered the Loch-Ness Monster with gulf shrimp, cheese, and avocado.  We will definitely return to eat when we come back to LV."}
{"text":"This old establishment is the typical coffee shop.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak.  I thought it was a pan fried variety, but the server told me it was deep fried.  The steak was breaded lightly and the breading was peeling off the steak.  This is typcial of pan fried, but not typical of deep fried.  This means their breading technique isn't good enough to keep the breading on the steak during the deep fry.  The steak was average.  The gravy had a lot of bits of ground sausage, so that was a plus.  More sausage than other places I tried here in Vegas. The Biscuit was small in comparison to other biscuits, but I can tell it's homemade by the flacky texture.  It was a very good biscuit.  The potatoes are thick potato chips.  Different, but burdensome.  Not used to having to use a knife with breakfast potatoes."}
{"text":"This is favorite breakfast spot when we are in Vegas. It is a local place that is always busy.  The biscuits and gravy are homemade and so good, they are a must here.  Our table shared a plate while we all decided what to order.  Nothing says breakfast can't have an appetizer too.    Today I had the scramble, eggs with large ham chunks and onions, very tasty.  The others had omelets and are stuffed with all the goodies they like (although I don't think I would ever like an omelet with asparagus and mushrooms but that's just me).   Each plate comes with their home potatoes which are thinly sliced like homemade potato chips but not fried to a crisp.  If your throwing caution to the wind, ask for a side of cheese sauce, it is a wonderful combination.  They have homemade soups so we ordered the ham and bean soup to go.  That will be our post night out gimme something to eat food.  I cant wait.  The service was friendly and our drinks were constantly topped off.  Family and kid friendly.  It is very plain on the outside and I likely would never have tried it if I wasn't with someone that already had.  The inside looks like my grandma decorated it but that is all part of the local, mom and pop place charm.  The biscuits and gravy make it all worth it."}
{"text":"I must say, I'm pretty impressed. I've never been one for breakfast food, until now.  My wife and I were driving out to the lake and found this little gem on the way.. and we are very satisfied we didn't pass this up.  Not only does this restaurant serve breakfast but they also offer some great options for lunch too.  I ended up taking a gamble on a breakfast item, which is a rarity for myself.. however, I went with the biscuits and gravy and MAN I am still left wanting more!  Our overall experience was pleasant and worth writing about.  We had good service, everyone was nice and the food was great! Try this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I came for the eggs Benedict and was so impressed i came back today. Started with the fried zucchini....omg....this place rocks"}
{"text":"I had the waffle deal, which consisted of one huge waffle, eggs and 2 bacon pieces.  The food was good, the restaurant was enormous but the decor was outdated.  I would go again for some good breakfast."}
{"text":"Great and fast service. They go out of their way to get exactly what you like. The only \"too bad\" thing is their fresh brewed iced tea is pretty so so. Would be awesome if they served tropical tea :-D"}
{"text":"I love this place. Walking into it is like walking into Grandma's house. There's antique knik-knacks everywhere and it's all strangely decorated that just tells you something about happiness... or some cheezy nonsense like that.   After the Lumberjacks fiasco, we're seated instantly, towards the back through this maze of an area filled, no joke.. FILLED with people. All smiles from the workers and the customers. Our drinks are immediately ordered and the bathroom is easily found by the signs that tell you where you need to go.  Our order was taken by a lovely waitress and drinks are refilled by a guy walking around with pitchers of water and pot of coffee.   Our food arrives and mine looks delicious. Blueberry stuffed pancakes and a side of spuds for me and what was supposed to be a Pastrami Burger for boyfriend... but the waitress mis-heard him and got him a Country Scrambler. Quickly corrected, she races back to tells us that his order is being made on rush and should be out in a few minutes. Once it's out, his burger is piping hot. She tells us that she'll be charging us for the Country Scrambler instead of the burger since it was her mis-hap. It's a few dollars cheaper, so we are a happy couple.   Food was absolutely delicious and I'm definitely revisiting."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. Gracious. I love this place. I normally order the stuffed blueberry French Toast and a side of spuds. It's a blueberry cream cheese sandwich. So amazing. The spuds are delicious and I could eat them daily if it weren't for my want to be more healthy... Who am I kidding? I love food!   I've never had a bad experience here. The servers are always friendly, tables are clean, decorations are ancient and it's great. I wish there were one on the south east side of town. =)"}
{"text":"Really good customer service but the breakfast wasn't as good. It wasn't bad just not my favorite. I love hash browns with my breakfast and they don't have any! What the heck I don't want to eat chips for breakfast! Don't get me wrong the chips are good, they would just be better for lunch with a sandwich or something. Not a bad place though."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast cafe place.  It's huge so they can accommodate lots of people and they do on those Saturday and Sunday mornings when it's hopping but I've never had more that a 5 minute wait.  I'm NEVER disappointed.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"My kind of omelet place! Definitely beats IHOP, Denny's, my microwavable omelet maker, what have you... I got the baby-sized Californian omelet (sausage, avocado, jack cheese), with pumpkin bread and spuds. My wonderful partner in crime opted for the regular sized meat lover's omelet (ham, bacon, sausage, jack cheese) with banana bread & spuds. We both finished barely half of our portions.. they are that big and tasty. Each breakfast comes with a side of bread & potato spuds. I personally love the pumpkin bread a lot! The seasoning on the potato spuds is pretty addictive as well..  Will come back to try other food items!"}
{"text":"Serious breakfast-eaters, this is your place.  If you don't like omelets, they have other stuff, I think, but I honestly can't say what it might be.  You have 3 size choices for omelets too.  The egg-stavigantic 12-egg.  You also have the regular sized, which is truly plenty for normal people.  You can also order a baby-version of any omelet for a slight savings.  The baby is about half the size of the normal.  And by normal, I mean 12 inches wide and 2+ inches thick.  Two can also split the plate if you can agree on what have.  I got the \"38-Special\", so named because it is # 38 on the menu.  Basically a meat-lovers with cheddar and jack cheese.  Best omelet I've ever had, anywhere.  Period.    There is a little of something on the menu for everyone.  Then there are the \"Spuds\".  Spuds come with just about everything and are an interesting cross between thick potato chips, and breakfast fries.  They have other locations in the Vegas area, but I will gladly make the trip out to Henderson again for this mostly-locals spot.  Close enough to Lake Las Vegas (where I was staying) to be the breakfast spot of choice.  Bring your appetites and stretchy pants."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Every time I come to Vegas I make my way over to Omelet house. I'm a sucker for the Chicken Fried Steak. When you pair it up with the homemade potato chips it's absolutely the best hangover food. You have to get there before 11 am or else you will be waiting for a while. Something that is a must get is the banana nut bread or the pumpkin bread. Both freshly baked everyday.   Their waffle special is also good for $9.00. If you go to iHop or Denny's the quality won't be the same. The omelets are huge. 6 eggs?!? That's bananas. You can get a 3 egg omelet for 89 cents off.   The decor looks like the inside of your grandmothers house. Plenty of vintage salt and pepper shakers and dusty silk flowers."}
{"text":"It's relatively clean here; although, I did not check out the bathroom. The food was mediocre. Typical diner food--stuff my kids could make at home. The service was okay as I was with a close friend who loves to entertain the wait staff, so I suspect my experience was better than average. I had to wait for someone to come to the register so I could pay to leave, then suddenly there were two people to show us out, one of whom was waving at my friend who is a regular (and a great tipper if they play along with her shenanigans). It seemed like there was no staff at the front unless there were customers at the front, and none of them had a whole lot of enthusiasm for being there. This was just like the Omelet Houses I've been to in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas area without the southern hospitality. Would I recommend it? Depends on what you're looking for. I prefer to find new places that inspire my own cooking; full-flavor, made from scratch, fresh."}
{"text":"Super awesome staff and great service ! The food was delicious! Everyone was nice and super attentive. BTW.. I had stuffed French toast with blueberry, side of scrambled eggs with cheese and a sausage patty."}
{"text":"This place most really have their shit together. All the reviews here read the same.  Great staff, fast & friendly service. 70s/80s diner decor/extensive breakfast menu  Great omelettes.  3 locations in the Valley-no real wait for a seat on Sunday AM?! Less than 5 minutes.  Give it a try-I'm glad I finally did."}
{"text":"We're staying at the nearby hotel & just wanted a real delicious filling meal to start the day with out draining our pockets. So glad we found this place on Yelp. I honestly wouldn't have found it otherwise. I had a tuna melt & spuds, husband had a burger, & the little one had a grilled cheese. The spuds are like thick cut potato chips, they were pretty good. Everyone was stuffed at satisfied by the end of the meal. Our wallet is still pretty stuffed to as this place isn't pricey at all. I only wish they had longer hours as I could really go for another sandwich & spuds right about now. We're probably going to get breakfast there again tomorrow morning before we head back home to AZ."}
{"text":"What a gem! This is a new must go to for me in Vegas. The food is delicious. I had the biscuits and gravy and it did not disappoint. Their crispy breakfast potatoes are to die for! Definitely make the trip off the strip to have breakfast here."}
{"text":"The omelettes are great. I love the spuds too! Also had the french toast with blueberries and it hit the spot. The coffee wasn't too great. Will be my go-to when in LV"}
{"text":"An institution when it comes to breakfast. Been here three times now and one thing about their omelletes are the servings are big. We ended up splitting the ginourmous \"kitchen sink\". Which had everything. The taste was ok for me. Except they went all out on the beans. Part of our party enjoyed it and ordered it twice already.  It was like eating two omelletes. I tried their lobster benedict which is ok. The pumpkin bread was good. The mile high omellete I ordered was a little dry. Everyone elses food came out ok. The Belgian waffles are huge and so are their waffles. Most of their dishes come with spuds and we all enjoy them extra crispy. We ended up ordering an extra order coz it was that good. The only issue I have with them is that their drinks are overpriced. Regular coffee, tea, or soda is 2.75. Their pancakes have a hint of baking soda that we could tell. Overall the service is what makes them shine. They do take good care of you. It's that at home feel that makes this place a gem that we sometimes miss being around big business. I know they will stand the test of time since they have been here a long time. Whenever in Vegas this is one of our stops for breakfast."}
{"text":"food is over rated. both omelets dry, coffee is colored water, worse than denny\"s. pumpkin bread and banana bread like the dry omelets (BIG) with very HARD POTATO Chips ALL came right out of the poison cancer causing \"micro wave\". WE will NEVER go back here again! Waitresses switched tables on several customers,it was amusing to watch, staff seemed confused about job duties, that was FUN to watch. The FOOD & COFFEE AWFUL. THEY NEED TO THROW OUT the micro wave that causes cancer & nukes out all nutrition and drys out food. make healthy food from scratch & cook it-dont nuke it! thats way most are sick, and why your place is empty!  NOTHING HEALTHY COMES OUT OF A MICRO-WAVE-DUMB IT !"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast with homemade signature banana and pumpkin breads. Quick coffee and water when we arrived as we were acknowledged immediately. Friendly waitress and generous portions of my egg white with veggies and hubby pigskin ham/cheese omelette. Potatoes are sliced thin and crispy like potato chips. Very delicious getaway from the pricey and low quality Las Vegas buffets."}
{"text":"It was ok but nothing to wrote home about. I expected if they won best of las vegas 9 times it would be 5 star food but nope. I would rate it right along Dennys in quality of the food and somewhere close to a Strip restaurant in terms of price. Like I said, it was just ok."}
{"text":"This probably would be my favorite restaurant on every trip to vegas food was delicious the place is awesome very comforting the lady waitress was so nice she make us feel good while we wait for our food the restrooms pretty clean, please if your in Las Vegas I recommend you this restaurant instead of any buffet in the strips is so much better option for your family."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a find.  I have been to Henderson 50 times and know have a breakfast spot.  The best!!!"}
{"text":"Well Yelpers, you've done it again!  After reading reviews and seeing the pictures, we had to give this place a try.    The atmosphere is home-y and friendly, lots of knick knacks.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  They were pretty busy but the service didn't suffer at all.  The food was amazing.  We had the corned beef hash, chili verde omelet, and biscuits and gravy.  Everything was homemade, the banana bread was warm and delicious, and our coffee cups were never empty.  We will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome, tons of food, great tasting and excellent service. Expect to pay about $10 a plate. \"Spuds\" are more like homemade potato chips than hash browns FYI."}
{"text":"So so amazing! I got the omelet with philly cheese steak in it and it was SO good! The portions are huge so get the smaller one! It was weird getting potato chips for breakfast but honestly not complaining. The customer service was great and everyone wanted to help and serve! Definitely will return again (:"}
{"text":"Party of 7. Service was fast. Every order was correct & service was perfect!  Food was delicious. A place to visit on your Vegas trip for sure!!  5"}
{"text":"Went here for mother's day and was excited to try it out.  We (of course) had to wait a bit, but we expected that.  We probably waited about 30 minutes or so after we were sat down until the owner/manager came over to our table and told us that if we didn't order now he was going to kick us out of his restaurant since other people were waiting!!!!  Keep in mind that our waiter hadn't even been by our table!  We were so taken aback by what he said and he actually even cussed at us!  By the time the waiter came over my mom was crying and he couldn't apologize enough.  The assistant manager even came over and apologized, but unfortunately the person who was unbelievably rude was above them.  The food was ok, but at that time we were pretty upset so I can't really give an honest review.  On our way out my mom talked to the owner/manager and expressed how upset she was about his outburst for us waiting for the waiter to come to our table.  He was even more rude, yelling, and cussing at her in front of customers.  And trust me, my mom is very quiet and never yells at anyone or gets upset with anyone.  If management changes, we will go back.  Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Amanda was so on point and delightful as our hostess. Please ask for her when being seated. Food was 5 as was the atmosphere. Highly recommended once again."}
{"text":"This is the best one of the chain.  I had 2 breakfasts and a lunch here and whenever I am in LV, I will be coming back for more.  Good food, well prepared.  Always get the fresh spuds!  And the people who work there will tell you the best local places to gamble...."}
{"text":"Quaint diner. Small town feel outside the big city.  This place is located in \"Hendertucky\" on Boulder Highway. Service is quick, food comes in huge portions, menu is varied (lots of omelet selections obviously), and coffee is served up hot. All pluses for me. Another plus was their warm, soft delicious banana bread served up with nice, spreadable butter. I love a place that brings me butter with my banana bread. That's the way to eat it right!  Husband and I both ordered omelets which were overflowing off our plates. We ended up taking a big portion of our meals home. I'd say the omelets had to be at least 5-eggs. They do not skimp.  If you're in the Hendertucky area and need a filling breakfast, this one is a winner!"}
{"text":"...I have shared a pic to my friend back in LA to show how delicious the food looks. prices are reasonable for the amount of food and how good it is. the appearance is unique, and what most important is how clean this place is. staff is so friendly... gotta try this place...!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp 31 Day Challenge #7 /31  It's NOT about the QUANTITY it's ABOUT the QUALITY!!!! Dear Omelet House didn't you know that by now?? :(  Ok maybe I was out partying to long the night before and wasn't really capable of judging the food, but I sure wasn't hangin (cuz I usually don't drink), so there must have been something wrong with what I ate...  So as we walk in I take a look at the menu and the selection is wow, they have everything u can possibly want, the service was also nice, a lady brought us the menus and immediately asked if we would like something to drink, OH YESSS a cup of coffee PLZ (i need it bad). So I looked at the menu and found my fav dish (which I usually make at home and is WAY better), then I go ahead and order my egg white omelet with lots of veggies and little bit of cheese, mhm talk about not being hungry for the rest of the day... As we wait for the \"goodies\" to be cooked we chit-chat and the omelets arrive, the \"goodies\" I thought a minute ago were now chunks of I'm guessing egg substitute, that wasn't even properly cooked (had that yucky mushy and gewy stuff that indicates it needs to be cooked more, hello). Ok the mushy and gewy wasn't even that bad I could still deal with that but it was really really un-tasty like I'm eating old eggs in economy class on a plain, plus the portion was the size of my head & they expect me to eat all that? Buahahaha yea right if u want to call an ambulance, cuz i'll explode... So I picked out the veggies ate those and did my best to try and eat a lil more, I had a big day ahead of me still needed to fuel up a bit, but seriously didn't eat half of half even yea that's how big the portion is and hey I CAN EAT!  Puh I kno I will never go back there, no need to upset my tummy like that, only if I knew I get leftover economy airplane eggs I would of never ever came here.  I'm sorry guys at least u get two stars, if it wasn't for the nice lady serving us I would of prolly gave u guys a one star.. I'm a breakfast person u know & I prolly know all the best spots for breakfast in HNL, and I was NEVER this unsatisfied with breakfast in my life :( sorry...  Maybe lay off the egg-substitute??"}
{"text":"Old school awesome!  Omelet house is super 70's meets 80's with a special table for the Mayor of Las Vegas.  Interesting people from all over the city meet here to discuss and fuss and chow down.  All of the food is good, and the pumpkin bread and banana nut bread is outstanding.   The OH has \"spuds\" which are thinly sliced potatoes fried in a skillet that heaven would probably order for a brunch.  Just a great breakfast spot!   I wish they had bagels, I really do, because that is all they are really missing here.  You can order your eggs anyway you want, and for the health conscience, you can sub whites or egg beaters, or have stuff cooked without oil, or get sliced tomatoes or cottage cheese.  They are breakfast savvy!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a dump so you're expecting your food to suck.  HOWEVER, the food is delicious!  Huge portions, very tasty, great sides, attentive wait staff, all in all a great deal.  It's a bit dim inside, reminiscent of a casino, and the wait for your food can be a bit long when it's busy, but it's well worth it.  The banana bread is some of the best I've had.  My omlette could've served three easily.  i ate half and gave the other half to a friend, who heated it in a microwave and said it was still delicious an hour later.   PS  The photos of the food on this page make it look nasty, but it's really quite good.  Looking at those thin cut fries makes my mouth water in remembrance."}
{"text":"Awesome omelettes, egg Benedicts and food in general. Really hidden in a corner of a shopping plaza but very well worth the journey. Portions are more than generous and price is excellent; awesome place I'll definitely come back when I'm in town"}
{"text":"Brunch is one of my favorite meals. The hours arent great, much like egg works, its a breakfast and lunch only place.   The food is very good. I love the omelettes, and prices are very reasonable compared to the portion sizes you get."}
{"text":"From the outside, you might think it's not all that appealing. It's been there since 1978 and they haven't done that much to \"update\" (which I rather love). But, Omelet House is the exact right combination of kitsch and comfort.   The interior is like a time machine. It's got a very 70's breakfast diner vibe, kind of like a Cracker Barrel, though not as countrified and not manufactured. It feels authentic and their knick-knacks feel curated and not just cookie cutter. It's got a lot of character and charm. It feels like going to breakfast with your grandparents.  In that good way.  The staff was so warm and genuinely enthusiastic about the food. When I asked two different servers what their favorites were, they were more than happy to share. They also pointed out that their omelets are SIX eggs and the options we had when ordering: we could get it baby-sized (3 eggs) for .89 cents less. Or we could split the full-size for .95 cents more and they'll give you extra potatoes. So that's pretty cool.  The prices were on par with other breakfast spots like Cracked Egg and Babystacks. Maybe a tiny bit higher, but there are six eggs in those omelets. SIX. So you're getting a lot for your money.  Each omelet was in the $9-10 range and they are served with toast (or homemade pumpkin or banana bread) and thin-sliced breakfast potatoes (almost crispy!).    There are maybe 15or 20 kinds of omelets to choose from. I had a baby-sized \"green chile omelet\", which had pork, chile verde and jack cheese. Even baby-sized, I could only eat half and barely made a dent in the potatoes, which were delicious. Everything was delicious, actually.  The look/texture of the chile verde was a little different than I expected. It's not *pretty*, per say, but it was *tasty*. Food around the room all looked delicious, I think it's just the nature of that particular style of sauce.  I'd eat it if offered, but don't know that I'd *order* it with so many other options.  Had a bite or two of the blueberry waffle, which was amazing, as well. Light, fluffy with the blueberry compote not overly sweet. Definitely a win when so many Belgian waffles tend to be too heavy or tough.  Two breakfasts with one orange juice was $24.65.  A little more than say, Denny's or IHOP, but much, much better.  And we brought home the leftovers to make into breakfast tacos for dinner.    Looking forward to going again... maybe next weekend..."}
{"text":"Food: Delicious, plentiful and fresh Customer service: Excellent Coffee: Fresh and not bitter Favorite dish: Banana bread and the shrimp and avocado omelette.   If you are in the area please check them out."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! My family and I came here on a whim, they wanted to go to IHOP, I thought that was a lame idea, so I yelped breakfast and found this place. I've been here at least 5-6 times now and every time it is amazing and consistent. I've NEVER needed a reservation, and they are ALWAYS super busy, even late in the afternoon on a weekday.  There are over 40 variations of omelets, and each omelet comes with a choice of bread, and a pile of sliced & fried potatoes. While there is a choice of bread, the only REAL choice is the banana nut bread. A square of it comes to you before your meal, hot with a side of butter to smother on it. My favorite omelet is The Californian, it comes with sausage, avocado and jack cheese.  BE WARNED, come extra HUNGRY, the omelets are a whopping 6 egg omelet, and I believe the average omelet is 9.99. If you have people to share with, order the fried zucchini which is on the lunch menu. You have the option of a 1/2 order or full order, both sizable orders. They have the choice of ranch or cheese dipping sauce, I always get both.  : ) You have the option of getting a smaller 3 egg omelet, but it is only .89 cheaper, so I say it just makes sense to get the regular one and do as much damage as you can.  The service is always great, some of the older waitress' seem like they're going to be rude, simply because they sometimes don't smile often, but they are always attentive and get your orders right and out quick. Again, this place is always busy, but the staff helps each other out, making the experience great, and turn around time efficient. I've brought my family here, including super picky younger brother and sister, and my in-laws, and everyone has loved it here. My in-laws loved the coffee FYI. My husband and I will continue to come here for as long as we live in Las Vegas, Thank you Omelet House!!"}
{"text":"A lot of food for the price! Soooo good ! I had the skillet and it was a ton of food after I finished! Service is good too"}
{"text":"Came here looking to get away from the strip scene. Found this place on yelp, and thanks to all the reviews, we decided this was going to be breakfast before heading home.  The location is in a sketchy area...but don't let that deter you from coming. The inside makes you feel like you are at your grandmas house. The decor and music are great. The food is even better.   I ordered the huevos rancheros and they were amazing. The boyfriend ordered the Philly cheesesteak omelette and he loved it. Like others have said, the portions are huge.   We will come back here no doubt. So glad we stumbled across this gem. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"This is just one of those little places here in Henderson that I absolutely love! The staff here is always kind and very attentive to every single customer that walks I  the door with either a greeting or a smile which is a nice way to start your day. Almost every time I come in get the country biscuits and gravy with bacon and it has never failed to start my day off right the casual ambiance and plenty of seating gives you room to just enjoy your meal and relax which is hard to find these days. Food portions are very healthy here you will not leave hungry at all I can never finish the potatoes but regardless just another tasty item on the plate. I suggest trying this place any time you are I  the neighborhood or have family in  town it's just such a nice little spot and you can't miss on anything you order. Thanks to the owner for keeping a really nice restaurant open and doing food the right way great job love having good you I  my neighborhood."}
{"text":"As a first timer I was not disappointed! Tried the zucchini and banana bread and they far exceeded my expectations. You get a lot of food and flavor for such a great price as well. I'm sad I live in California otherwise this would be my regular breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Work nearby good service, very close by to me. The food is really greasy. Not a bad place to go to one a month every day I don't think so."}
{"text":"I feel like home here!  I love this place foods always good the waitresses are always super nice huge portions and good prices.   Tip: Get the Lobster Benedict trust me!!"}
{"text":"One of the better home cooking type of breakfast places I've been to. Omelet  is light and fluffy, large and stuffed with salty smoked ham and a nice cheddar cheese. The home potatoes are nearly home made potato chips yet not quite there and are a delightful crunchy treat with breakfast. The blueberry cream cheese stuffed french toast is very tasty, the french toast batter and melted cream cheese work well together. The coffee shop is dated adding to the experience, there's a balloon lady making the kids ballon hats and animals and the staff are attentive and friendly.    Update, the owner or manager replied to my Yelp review today thanking me for my review, pride of ownership / management a big plus in the food industry."}
{"text":"With so many buffets and restaurants in Las Vegas, I was hesitant to wander off the strip to grab breakfast.  But we decided to give it a try since we were leaving anyway.  WOW!! By far the best omelet I ever had!  These are not your normal 2-to-3-egg omelets I'm used to getting.  They are SIX (6) egg omelets that are amazing.  So many choices too.  They brought me warm banana bread before the omelet arrived that was a slice of pure heaven.  I will make this my go-to breakfast place every time I'm in Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. We don't have anything like this out in LA.  Take my advice folks. Get any of the eggs Benedict dishes. Truly amazing for the taste, quality and price. That with a coffee and or OJ and you're going to have a happy morning.  We went ahead and got omelettes too. I have to say it's a LOT of egg. So if you order this, you won't need anything else. I split the omelette and eggs Benedict with my friend, and i wish I had ordered the eggs Benedict for myself. He cut me the smaller half of the two eggs because he knew what was up."}
{"text":"We all ordered sandwiches for brunch with my family and we all rated about a 5/10. We didn't like the chips that it came with either. They were mostly soggy but the crispy one were good. It's fairly priced too."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!!! The food was so good! Pancakes are amazing!! We ordered an omelet with steak bell peppers and jack cheese. The potatoes are delicious with some ketchup! Yum! Crispy! LONI is the best!!! Such a sweet sweet lady I felt like I was her granddaughter! I would ask to sit in Loni's section :) The banana nut bread is so delicious and moist but the pumpkin bread was my favorite it's so spicy!!! Coffee was good! Everything is just amazing! Except the decor lol it's literally like eating at a pawn shop  but the food and service is worth it. I definitely recommend it and I will be back!"}
{"text":"we were out in Henderson this morning and decided to give this place a try.  So glad we did.  Fast service and the food was AMAZING!  They even have a 12 egg omelet for $20....WOW!  Im not sure who could eat all of that but what a deal."}
{"text":"Experience:  I brought some out of town friends who asked me for breakfast at a local spot that wasn't touristy. I have been here about 3 to 4 times in the past and always enjoy it. This time was no different.    Food: we started out with some of their Zuchinni Sticks, because they are so good. We got half an order, which was plenty for 3 of us.     They ordered omelettes, but I went to an old safety...their homemade Hash and eggs. It is so good!!!   There are big chunks of corned beef and fried with potatoes. It comes with two eggs, their delicious breakfast hash browns, which are more like yummy chips, and your choice of bread. And here's the best part...besides the normal toast, muffin choices, they have homemade Pumpkin or Banana Bread.   Since I got my eggs over easy, I needed toast to sop it up, so I always order some Banana Bread in the side Togo.     The portions are huge, so there will be a Togo box, unless you downsize to half omelettes.   Service: the service is typical of a very busy breakfast place.  Not rude or slow, but not friendly or fast. But the food is good, so I don't care.   Facility:  this is a divey kinda place, but with an eclectic flare.  They have memorabilia from all things Vegas and old school. A lot of the items are for sale too.   Overall review: probably my fav breakfast place. Their food has never disappointed, so I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I waited a bit to be seated. And I thought it was weird that we were led through the back of one of the work stations to our table.  But at least the waiter was cute... in a despondent, coked-out, model-esque way.  After waiting an egregious amount of time to place our order we flagged down a waitress. She replied she would send someone over.  But at least that server was cute. I ordered the chicken and broccoli omelet. The food came out surprisingly quick, and he split our checks.   Two hours later I experienced some type of demonic, food poisoning episode. I threw up, felt severe stomach cramps, and a headache. I think my head did 360 spins.   Maybe I ordered the wrong omelet. I think I'll just order coffee next time. But at least the waiter was cute."}
{"text":"I've got two words for this place big food. Normally on our lunch hour we go in here and I am always going to get the California omelette it has avocado sausage and cheese. I really can't think of anything better. I always get the baby omelette it only takes off about $.95 but I'm telling you you won't notice that it's baby because it's huge plus you get these fries which are more like chips and they have this crazy salty peppery chivey deliciousness on top of them. You also get your choice of bread and believe me people always rave about the pumpkin bread and people always rave about the banana bread I don't eat bananas and all of the breads have walnuts which I also don't eat so I just get a side of sourdough toast which is great. So yesterday my friend convinces me to try the chicken fingers and oh my gosh. So generally they ask you if you want ranch with them but read the menu closely because you get to choose between ranch and cheese sauce. That's right cheese sauce how evil genius is that?? It is so good and it still comes with those wonderful chips"}
{"text":"Probably our best LV find!  We came here while visiting for the rodeo.  Yum!!  Mom and pops local feel!  Reasonable prices, lots of food!  Great menu, the omelets are BIG and fresh and good!!!!  Wow!   Make sure you get the banana nut bread too!    We will for sure come back next year.  This would even be good for lunch.    Clean place.  Great service."}
{"text":"Great service...big portions!!! Old fashion setting...nice place!!! If your really hungry...I definitely recommend eating here!!!"}
{"text":"Old diner vibe with worn vinyl booths.  Country on the radio.  Coffee is decent and piping hot.  Ordered a late AM biscuits and sausage gravy meal.  After 20 minutes the food arrived.  Good biscuit and tasty gravy, although not even a crumb of sausage was present.  I'm certain they made up a small batch of gravy sans the sausage.  Bacon was room temp but good flavor.  Eggs were lukewarm but cooked to order.  Potatoes were fried potato-chip style and room temp.  I expected grilled potatoes with breakfast.  Average all around.  At least it had good flavor?"}
{"text":"I have loved everything I have ever had here.   My husband loVes the pumpkin bread.   I only wish they served dinner."}
{"text":"Soft, fluffy pancakes.  Crispy bacon.  Fresh eggs.  Amazing, warm pumpkin nut bread. Great and fast service.  Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"We were vacationing in Boulder City and we love to find a good breakfast place where ever we go. We really liked this spot. The potatoes are to die for! I loved my basic breakfast, huge portions and the pumpkin bread that came with it was so good! The service was also great!  They were attentive and so sweet to our baby boy! My friend didn't love her waffle, so I gave it a 4, but would definitely recommend the Omelet House if you are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I ordered egg Benedict and it's great and great waitress my husband ordered waffle n eggs n bacon he says taste great"}
{"text":"Okay, so the coffee is awesome...the food is even more awesome. All I can say is, 6-egg omelets. Yeah...6!! The pumpkin bread is so good...and yummy fluffy pancakes too! They have these potato \"chips\" that are amazing. Cece was our server...she  was the absolute BEST! HI CECE!!! :) So, I'm ALWAYS going to come back for breakfast whenever I'm in Vegas. ;)  Until next time...mmmm."}
{"text":"LOBSTER EGGS BENEDICT!  Im leary of eating seafood in breakfast joints....so yummy ! Nice staff & rapid service !"}
{"text":"Service here is a little rough around the edges. Waitresses would interrupt each other in the middle of helping customers. However they're nice enough. Had the lobster benedict and it was ok. Eggs were cooked well but the whole thing was drowned in hollandaise. They only offer these with thick-cut over-seasoned chips as a side and they're nothing impressive. The menu is covered in disclaimers like, no split checks and $1 for substitutions. The whole menu comes off as unaccommodating. Over all the place is very forgettable."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  But beware though, a lot of food. Make sure that if you get any omelets. Get the 3 egg one. That is big in it self. Waffle special is go too"}
{"text":"So I'm in town for a class and needed to find an early morning breakfast. Yelp did not let me down!  This place opens at 7 which is perfect.  When I arrived I saw several people waiting for it to open and the all appeared to be locals. All good signs for a good meal.    I had the country scramble, it came with ham, mushrooms, eggs, onions and potato's, without the cheese. It was good, the potato was served like chips which I used to scoop up my food and eat. I got a side of salsa and I have to say, get the salsa it's yummy.  Service was good and my water never ran out.   I'm here for a week so I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Very good food and very good service. I actually found it to be better than your typical IHOP or Denny's or even Waffle House."}
{"text":"This place has an old time, grandma feel to it mixed with grandpa's hunting game days. It has a weird nostalgic homey feel to it that just feels right. Staff here are very attentive and friendly, and their food portions are GINORMOUS!   You will leave hating yourself, holding your belly or groaning, or both. Either way, it's good... Especially after an all-nighter."}
{"text":"Holely moley this place has the biggest omelettes I've ever seen! Seriously you could feed three people with one of these monsters! The omelet was very tasty and the service good too!"}
{"text":"The food was okay... I've definitely had better. I guess i kind of expected more based on the other reviews... I had the waffle breakfast which came with 4 pieces of bacon and eggs. The waffle was warm and not hot like fresh and the cold syrup didn't taste like maple syrup.... The eggs were blah, but the bacon was good. 2 friends had Omlettes and they didn't like them. 2 other friends had the french toast breakfast and it was pretty much like the waffle breakfast, they had better. Also they do not have turkey bacon, just an FYI.   There was also flies in the restraunt and the booths could use some dusting and cleaning. I totally get the vintage look, but not dusty vintage.  The funny thing is, I thought that this was another place that I went to and it totally was not. *sad face*"}
{"text":"This place knows how to do breakfast!! And there were a fair amount of people ordering lunch too so I would guess that is good as well. Even though I'm not usually much of an omelet fan, I ordered a ham and cheese omelet \"the piglet\". There was tons of meat and cheese and it was absolutely delicious! I didn't see it on the menu but the omelet came with choice of homemade banana or pumpkin bread. The banana bread was killer!! Tasted better than my grandma even made!! Definitely give this place a try if you're able to!"}
{"text":"Good! A lot for the price, totally worth the drive and everyone working is extremely friendly and attentive but not in an annoying way!"}
{"text":"The banana bread and the pumpkin bread are absolutely amazing. As soon as you order they'll bring you your choice (if it comes with the meal which most meals it does). The bread is super fresh and warm and served with whipped butter, it doesn't get much better than that. I have actually been here a couple of times and the service is always consistent, very sweet, very attentive staff. The food is sooooo good, I ordered the Petunia omelet and it was great, I loved the crispy bacon in it. Another great consistent food is the potatoes, they are like homeade chips but they go wth everything. I love that they have something different than every other breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Great food and fabulous service. Sad to leave food on the plate, bit the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Woke up craving Waffles.  So I did what i do best: I yelped for a breakfast spot. :)  I gave this place 4 stars for: Speedy and friendly service.  Your normal all American diner spot...well lit, enough parking... The pumpkin bread was awesome.   #38 meat lovers omelet was crispy on the edges (I like) lots of meat, and spuds (seasoned and thinly sliced and friend potatoes) were tasty. Portions were huge.  I came here with two others, neither one of us were able to finish our orders.  we walked out with 3 boxes. :)  Cons: (1)If you wanted to share an order (which are all pretty big) extra charge   0.95 just for an extra plate.  (2)There was way too much cheese in the omelets.  I like cheese but when you cut into the omelets, if left untouched for a few minutes, you see a whole layer of cheese oozing out.  :( I don't find that tasty at all.  (3) There were about 40 different styles of omelets to choose from but we notices that the options offered either had all meat, or all veggies: No options for an omelet with ham, spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes! Sucks... (4) Lastly, my waffle was okay. nothing memorial. It wasn't crispy enough, the inside was a bit too soft (I momentarily questioned if it was fully cooked), so i couldn't really pour the syrup on it.    Overall, I will definitely be visiting again. the next time however, I'll be skipping the waffle and settling for the pumpkin bread, asking for light cheese on my meat lovers omelettes and possibly some spinach too.    Thanks for a great breakfast Omelet house.    Tk"}
{"text":"Everything that I have had here is always on point and the portions are more than enough to fill you up..so I cant give a plug on any certain items other than the must have pumpkin bread and the staff is always cool..if you are in the area and in need of a bomb ass breakfast fix.. definitely don't pass up the omelet house"}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak omelet is to die for! Service is on point and the way they serve potato is *muah* *kisses fingers to the sky*"}
{"text":"Seriously?  Why did I ever stop coming to this location years ago? Probably because I moved.  Every Wednesday lately, my friend and I go to breakfast.  He's pretty laid back so I get to choose and something told me to choose the Old Omelet House on Charleston today.  What a GREAT experience!  Sydney made our breakfast even better with her outstanding service!  I would do what you can to hold on to her because word of mouth is the BEST marketing tool! I will definitely let my friends and everyone know about this place and about Sydney! Great food,  exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Love this place! ! Pumpkin bread is AMAZING .Great portions you get what you pay for . Forget ihop and dennys ."}
{"text":"That's the last meal we had for our Las Vegas trip. If you like to eat omelet you have to come here. Six eggs omelet is huge and the piece of  cake come with the meal's so delicious. The staff there's so nice and the price of the food's not expensive at all. We had a good time there, definitely will come back next time."}
{"text":"This place is hella old school. When you walk in, they have collector trinkets in display for sale. Makes you feel like you're walking into a grandparents house. Friendly people greet you at the door with warm smiles, as if you're walking into their home.  And also just like your grandparents house, you better come hungry because they will feed you well for the price! An omelette comes with potatoes and a pumkin/banana bread or a toast."}
{"text":"OMG This place is AMAZING!! Each team I come to Vegas, I always have to find time to sit and eat here. The portion sizes are huge, you'd definitely be satisfied"}
{"text":"Wowzers that is some hearty stick to your bones breakfast fuel for the day!  On our way to Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam I pulled this place up in a Yelp search and off we went.  We were sat right away and our server was on point and super friendly.  We were all so hungry we couldn't narrow down what we wanted and she really helped us make the best selections.  I ordered the chicken fried steak with gravy, potatoes, two eggs over medium, side of sourdough toast and added bacon because apparently I didn't have enough meat on my plate.  The gravy was mind blowing and the chicken fried steak was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.  My eggs were buttery and cooked to a perfect medium.  I could have done without the potatoes because they were a bit limp and flavorless.  The bacon was thick, crispy and all that is the greasy goodness that bacon should be.  The fact that they had apple jelly on the table made my toast way more enjoyable.  The coffee was also noteworthy because it was strong, just the way I like it!  I tried my friend's banana bread and let me tell you I haven't had any version of this that was this good since I was a kid.  The portion sizes were huge, especially on the omelets so you could probably share one if you wanted to.  You pay at the register but, our server was kind enough to take it up for us and cash us out.  We boxed up our extras for my dog patiently waiting in the car and headed out on our daily adventure.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! This place is amazing! If you go away hungry is your own fault! Omlets as big as the plate and they don't skimp on the ingredients! LOVED the atmosphere Super friendly and off the strip! This is a must visit place"}
{"text":"When it comes to a delicious and filling breakfast, the Omelet House is a place to call home. The Omelet House has been home to delicious and filling breakfast for over thirty years. It is my understanding that this location is the second with the original being off Charleston. This location is off Boulder Highway where the road transitions from the Boulder Strip into the ribbon of concrete passing through southeast Henderson toward the Hoover Dam. It is a road that has taken me to the parkland abutting southeast Henderson. A couple of times on the way to these open spaces I'd stop at this Omelet House.        The Omelet House is a living legend. According to a Las Vegas Sun article, Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman declared September 12 Kevin Mills Day to in honor of the owner (http://m.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/omelet-house-owner-honored-key-las-vegas). The crowds that line up to get into the restaurant honor the owner with a very popular breakfast and brunch restaurant. On my leading visit here, the wait was so long that I ended up sitting at the counter. Last time, I beat the crowds. The Omelet House is so popular that in recent times they built a location a few miles northwest at Boulder and Russell Road.       This is an interesting restaurant to check out the pictures and decorations. It just reminds me of a place you would see off Historic U.S. 66. I call this American Road Trip dining. This is a fitting environment since Boulder Highway is a Great American that connects Fremont Street to Hoover Dam and was the original US 93/95 before the freeway rerouted it. Proceeding this review is a couple of pictures of the nostalgic inside. Now I will talk about the inside of the menu.       The centerpiece of the menu is the massive offering of omelets. There are at least twenty choices of omelets with every kind of name and style. It was so difficult to make a decision. But where there is a problem there is a solution. The solution to the problem of choosing from the sundry of omelets was to order the western breakfast scrambler off the menu.      Both times that I had breakfast here, it was the western breakfast scrambler. I really admired the taste of ham, onions, mushrooms, cheese, and yummy ingredients surrounded by potato spuds. At the Omelet House, the majority of breakfast dishes feature the Potato spuds. They truly are delicious and in my opinion add to the quality of the breakfast. Good service ultimately adds to the quality of service.       The server was on top of my coffee refills. Good coffee by the way. On my last visit, the waitress had a good sense of humor at the expense of my clumsiness. We both got a laugh out of the fact that I unintentionally added the empty packets of Sweet N Low into my coffee and had managed to get ketchup on the green currency that I paid with. It is nice when the staff has a sense of humor especially when the food was good.      The Omelet House has the winning ingredients of a place to have breakfast: delicious food, good coffee, friendly service, an upbeat environment, and a location on the way to hiking trails. I would choose the Omelet House as a home for breakfast in the future."}
{"text":"Great Service. Food was mediocre to say the least. homemade corned beef hash was delicious, but the potatoes and eggs were SO greasy! and the oil tasted OLD.  I might come back... but then again, I might not."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast, for the money, ever!!!  The coffee train keeps the cup hot and filled.  The servers are friendly.  A real family atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"We had the Sausage egg & gravy omelette and also the stuffed apple cinnamon French toast! Amazing super yummy food, very kind friendly faces and fast service too!! Definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Wasn't blown away by this spot. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish.   FOOD: I ordered the eggs Benedict (my usual go-to at bfast joints). The order (according to the menu) came with Spuds and \"your choice of toast, English muffin, homemade pumpkin nut bread, banana bread, or tortillas\". I went with the Spuds and banana bread. The Spuds are basically potato chips with seasoning. They tasted soft and old. The banana bread was pretty good. It came out nice and warm. I wasn't blown away by the Benedict. Instead of Canadian ham, they layered it with a stack of deli ham. And there was just too much sauce.   PRICES: ~$10/dish. According to the menu, I thought the banana bread was included but apparently it wasn't. I had to pay an extra $2.50. Coffee was $2.50 as well, includes refills.   SERVICE: My waitress checked on me a few times and refilled my cup whenever needed. She was nice and friendly.   Overall, I wouldn't come back here. I paid $20 total for one person. I don't mind paying that price but I've been to better bfast spots that also offer better combos and deals."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden, old-school gem.  The plates are definitely oversized, so plan to share if you have another person with you!  The omelets are incredible, and they're served with breakfast potatoes and bread side of choice- GO FOR THE BANANA NUT BREAD, it's worth the calories!  I enjoyed the California omelet, but there are more than enough to choose from for your specific wishes.  They do not accept AMEX.  Service is always friendly and quick."}
{"text":"My first time here and I will definitely be back. I was looking for a new breakfast place with good portions at an affordable price and Omelet House is it. The service was great, Jennifer was amazing. I had biscuits and gravy and the hubby had a green chili omelet. They were both out of this world!! The spuds were addictive. Very satisfied. A must if you're in Vegas looking for delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot for breakfast that's reasonably priced and gives you a lot of food for what you order. There's lot of breakfast choices, but the star of the show is the banana nut and pumpkin bread they give you before your meal. Also, the potato spuds are basically potato chips that are seasoned and ridiculously delicious. This place gets pretty busy, but the restaurant is also really big and seats lots of patrons at one time, so don't get discouraged by all the cars in the parking lot."}
{"text":"It was our first time here on a Sunday morning and we arrived at around 945am. There was virtually no wait, we were lucky I think. There's a huge lobby or front waiting area which I appreciate because breakfast joints like Denny's always have such small waiting areas and people are forced to wait outside in the cold or hot. First thing I noticed was all the farmer-ish Americana decor everywhere, ceramic or porcelain chickens and milk trucks...very homey and cute. They have the mother load of omelet options! The menu was a looong savory list!  They have kid friendly options, small portion options, split plate options and the portion sizes are hefty. We got a pancake for the little one, a kids portion scrambled eggs and bacon, we shared a side of biscuit and gravy, I got the French toast special, and the big man got the ham & eggs! Spuds btw, are freaking awesome! They're sliced almost as thin as potato chips, fried and topped with seasoning. So good!  Our server was friendly, and so was the rest of the staff that came by to help us. The place is very attentive, we had three refills of coffee, the kids got refills of their apple juices...we never had to ask. Our food came out quickly too, I want to say everything came out in 15 minutes from the time we placed our order. Once we received our food, we knew it was way too much. Did I tell you about portion sizes?!  I didn't visit the restroom during this trip so I'm not sure what the restroom situation is, but we are definitely adding this place to our top breakfast digs."}
{"text":"Lobster omelette, okay! I was really happy with the breakfast spread here. The butter was really yummy. The banana bread was better than the pumpkin. The omelette selections were awe inspiring!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had breakfast here last week, on a Saturday morning...we expected a long wait but it was only 5-10 minutes.  The service staff were AMAZING, very attentive. As my friend put it \"those girls never stop moving!\" Very impressed!  The  menu is huge, but once we settled on our choices, an omelet and country fried steak, we were pretty excited from watching other orders come out.  Everything smelled amazing,  the banana bread and coffee are enough of a reason to com back and get a 5star from me as is...sooooo good!     Our food was hot and fresh and delicious, the omelet my friend ordered was huge and yummy and even after several minutes on the table was still steaming hot and thr cheese was melty and amazing! My country fried steak was almost perfect and the potatoes were on point!  I had such an amazing experience not only are we going back Friday for breakfast but I'm looking to find out if they're hiring, this is not just a great place to eat but it's a place i want to work at!  Definitely come to henderson and check this little slice of breakfast heaven out....if youre not local to the area...worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"My husband eats here every time he comes to Vegas and enjoys the quaint hometown feel. We came as a family and the kids enjoyed it a lot too. They loved the balloon lady.  Definitely will return, you won't leave there hungry that's for sure! The banana bread was yuuuummmmmmyyyyy!!!"}
{"text":"Large portions with a humorous menu. Great service and friendly staff. Highly recommend and plan to come back on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Failsafe food. When I'm craving a great breakfast at a fair price with good service, this is where I go. My car can almost drive itself here as I've been here so many times. From omelets to french toast, you really can't go wrong giving the Omelet House a try. I've also brought kids, teenagers, and other family with me and the kids love the french toast, and it's one place where the teenagers don't walk out and 30 minutes later complain that their hungry.   I'm bumping the Omelet House to 5 Stars...and I don't hand out 5 Star reviews lightly. But when you've been there practically every weekend for months and it's been consistently good every time I've been...they've earned those stars. I'm also putting them on my Best of Vegas list...and I want to thank my Yelp followers for recommending this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on Charleston in a sketchy section of town.  We both ordered 3-egg omelets which came with a choice of bread, muffin or bagel.  Each of us chose pumpkin nut bread, a house specialty, which proved to be very dense and was largely left behind.  My wife ordered the Green Hornet which featured avocado,  tomato and cheddar cheese while mine was the Popeye prepared with spinach, mushrooms and Jack cheese.  Both were a little too thick and heavy for us."}
{"text":"One of our favorites since it opened ! Great fresh food and always good service ! The servers are wonderful and they have that local cafe touch that makes you want to come back. The eggs always taste fresh, not cold storage, and their bacon never tastes old. I personally am a sucker for the \"Patty Page\" patty melt at lunch time.. Yum ! I have been told by a couple of friends that they would prefer a different choice on the breakfast potatoes other than the homemade chips but I guess they have their reasons for serving the chips as long as we have been going. My wife likes their Mexican menu that starts at 10:00 AM and we think their beans taste like they are homemade. They serve large servings of everything so take your appetite !"}
{"text":"My group decided to have breakfast here before heading home from our weekend in Vegas.  Still sick, and having spent the entire weekend violently throwing up with food poisoning I had no intention of eating anything else that i'd end up tossing 5 minutes after consumption.  However, my sister and boyfriend INSISTED I try eating something so I hesitantly ordered a cup of their chicken noodle soup. Because the soup was the first thing I'd been able to keep down in 2 full days my opinion may be a little bias but...  IT SAVED MY LIFE. It was perfect for my sick stomach. Lots of veggies, big chunks of white meat chicken, and not salty at all! This was the best homemade chicken noodle soup I have ever eaten.. The next time I am in Vegas I'm having a real breakfast here!"}
{"text":"I didn't think much of the place nor was it on my radar for restaurants I needed to try, but I was pleasantly surprised! Luckily for a holiday Sunday, it wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. Ruben and I ordered their very large omelets and could only eat half! The portions are ridiculously generous and the prices are very inexpensive. That completely earned them another star. I tried the \"Plymouth Rock\" with huge chucks of turkey breast, a lot of guacamole, and jack cheese with egg whites (I'm pretty sure there it was four eggs). Delicious. I got their \"Spuds\" with my meal, which are like housemade potato chips just a little thicker, so it still had their texture with some crispy parts. Little under seasoned, but good! With your gigantic omelet, you also get a choice of toast, Pumpkin Bread, or Banana Nut Bread. You must get the Pumpkin or Banana Nut. We ordered one of each and really enjoyed it! I preferred the Banana Nut (yum!), but both were good - moist, just enough flavor and sweetness, and of course, a generous serving. Service was really great and overall, great experience."}
{"text":"The menu has so many omelets to pick from. I'll have to come again, I didn't get my 1st and 3rd choices. On top of normal menu items (so many) they have the specials that change on top of that.   The Lobster fest is really good, it's huge and has so many chunks of lobster and Avocado.   The cowboy looked really good on paper, but but a little heavy, as I wasn't suffering a hangover I thought it better to save that for another day.   The service is awesome, the servers are all supper freindly and the food is quick. The ambiance and the service are the complete package and it feels like step back in time. Come hungery, it's a huge amount of food. I don't think anyone finished their plates at our table, I skipped lunch after that."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The food is tremendously large portions but they offer petite\" sizes. The staff is great, friendly and makes the dining breakfast experince the best! The prices are amazinh as well. Well worth your money!"}
{"text":"Can anyone say \"Humongous!\" or \"Enormous!\" portion?! These are for the regular omelets...there is a poster for a 12 egg omelet!!! Mmmmm...flashing imageries of Man vs. Food...  Ok, besides the size of the portion...  Omelets were good, BUT the stars were the baked goods.  -Biscuits - They were the lightest, the flakiest biscuits I had in a long time...I think the secret is that they are yeast biscuits.    -Waffles - Again, they looked like any other waffles, then you bite into them, crunchy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside....DON'T drown them in syrupy...we dipped!    -Pumpkin Bread - their secret recipe...came as a choice for your side...get it.  Old fashion diner feel.  There were so many regulars that a couple of the tables around us didn't need to say what they wanted for breakfast.  The waitress just asked, \"your usual?\""}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite breakfast spots for years, and hands down the best place I have been to in Las Vegas for omelets. Their portions are huge, their prices are reasonable and everything taste great.  One note on this review, the Omelet House is open for breakfast and lunch, but I have never had anything off their lunch menu. I have looked it over, and it mainly consist of sandwiches and burgers. This review is based upon their breakfast food only.  The Omelet House has that country style ambiance that is fitting a breakfast place. No hipster re-purposed wood walls here, but there are porcelain chickens and other farm animals for decorations.  The menu is very large, and they have quite a few options to choose from. The star of the menu is, as you'd expect, the omelets. They have well over 30 omelets to choose from, as well as a large selection of skillets. Egg related breakfast options dominate, though they do have a fair selection of pancakes and french toast for those that want a sweeter breakfast option. The entrees range in price from around $8 up to $12 for some of the pricier omelets, like the lobster omelet (yes, real lobster for $12 in a omelet). The prices seem downright cheap when you see the portions, as the omelet's are at least twice as large as most restaurants. Omelets seem to be made with at least six eggs here. You can easily split an omelet and I usually only eat half and box the other to take home.  My favorite omelets are the kitchen sink, the lobster and the chili verde. The kitchen sink is the biggest omelet, and it contains a little bit of everything. Inside you'll find chili, cheese, kielbasa, sausage, ham, bacon, turkey, and a slew of veggies. The lobster, as mentioned above, contains real lobster! It also has cheese and avocado, and it's huge and delicious. The chili verde has cheese and green chili stewed pork, and it's awesome if you like Mexican food. For an extra dollar they will add diced jalapeno and habanero to the omelet if you like it spicy.  The skillets are also very good, and though they aren't quite as big as the omelets the portions size is still very large. My wife got the meatloaf skillet last time and there was well over a pound of meatloaf on the potatoes and eggs.  All the breakfast come with home fried potatoes, which are good, and served in a pile, but I have had better. The potatoes are thin sliced and often get a bit soggy, but this is really the only thing at the omelet house that isn't great to me.  The breakfast also come with a choice of toast, pumpkin bread or banana nut bread. As much as I love a good slice of sourdough toast, you have to get one of the homemade breads here. They are both great, but the pumpkin bread is better in my opinion. I get it every time I come here and it is another thing that makes their meals fantastic and huge.  This really is an amazing place to eat breakfast. If you are a fan of big breakfast or love omelet's, you really need to come here. This place is actually worth trekking across town for."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Delicious food, fantastic service and crazy portions! Definitely worth a stop for an excellent breakfast experience."}
{"text":"It's a great restaurant but I can't recommend this place because you have to wait in a very long line to get in.  But what if you're already hungry?  I was waiting in line and some angry old white man poked me on my back startling me.  Any decent person would have simply said excuse me.  This restaurant seems to attract a type of clientele which doesn't have my best interest at heart.  The food is pretty average.  The prices are a little pricy depending on what you order.  If you come alone you have to sit at a very small table.  It's tiny.  You can't even stretch your legs or arms.  I do like their omelettes however.  It would be nice to only come here when it's not busy.  If you are an ultra conservative Republican and Lilly white you will fit right in, in this place.  If not.  Good grief.  Try going to the \"egg and I\" instead.  They are more accepting of diversity over there.  This review is for the omelette house on Charleston not the one on Boulder Highway in Henderson."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try for breakfast. This is an old restaurant and you can tell that it has been here for many years. It was Friday around 10:30 in the morning and all the tables were filled. I am sure there will be a wait on the weekends, but it will be worth it. All of the staff was super nice, you can tell that they truly love their jobs and are happy to be there. I have to commend my servers Kelly and Jessie for their perfect service, both went above and beyond to satisfy my picky eaters.  One son ordered the Jolly Green Giant omelette which was a vegetable omelette - it was delicious. My other son ordered a chocolate chip pancake in the shape of Mickey Mouse head that was plenty big enough to fill him. The portions here are huge.  All of their omelettes are made with six eggs. You can get a smaller portion with 3 eggs for $.99 less, but I would recommend getting the full order and taking your other half home and heating it up later. We will definitely will come back here again, great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat at for breakfast. Way too many options though. Took us at least 10 minutes on deciding what to eat. I highly recommend this place if you're starving. The portions are extremely big. One omelet plate can feed almost 3 people!! Flavors were good and the service was great. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I was browsing Yelp for breakfast spots near me and Omelet House came up. After reading a few of the reviews I decided to try it for myself.   The place was packed, but we waited no more than 5-10 mins for a table.   After we were sat the server quickly came around and grabbed our drink order.   I decided on the Toadstool (mushroom) omelet. I decided to try the pumpkin nut bread.   The portions were huge! The food was amazing. I loved the flavorful pumpkin nut bread which was served warm with butter. The breakfast spuds, thicker slices of potatoes which were fried.... AMAZING.   Service was superb. We were checked in on frequently and offered refills of coffee and water, never running low.   I definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"We use yelp to find restaurants when we are in area we are not familiar with, the Omelet House was a gem. We will make it our breakfast place whenever we are in town!"}
{"text":"The place looks like an old school diner full of antiques that are for sale. We got the jack of all trades burger which was mediocre, nothing special. The server said it came with fries but it came with thick cut potato chips that had French fry consistency so those were new and interesting. We originally ordered the chili verde skillet which looked amazing but came with pork (even though the menu didn't say so). Our server seemed annoyed when we asked him to switch it out because we don't eat pork and he assumed we knew chili verde meant pork. We got the veggie skillet instead and it was a big disappointment. The veggies weren't thoroughly cooked and it looked as though they just topped the veggies with a scrambled egg. Not to mention, the coffee was watered down. I won't be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Gosh, we stopped by here before the drive back to Phoenix a few years back. Fast forward to now. It was the Fourth of July and omg, they're open? It was time for a long overdue visit.  They are only open in the mornings til early afternoon, so late risers, you are missing out, but trust me, waking up early for this is most definitely worth it. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu - everyone in our party ordered something different and nobody left feeling dissatisfied. The food is tasty, the ideal hearty breakfast that you need to get you fueled for the day. Portion-sizes are not for the weak either, or a box might be in order, we definitely all needed one. Plus we had the nicest, friendliest waitress.  Amazing food, cozy atmosphere, and great service - that's just the ingredients for the start of a great day!  PS. I wish I could say I was either team banana bread or team pumpkin bread but they're both too good, I still can't decide. Guess that means another trip is in order!"}
{"text":"Driving up to this diner was a little sketch since the area seems more on the run down side, but once we walked in, I knew we made a good decision. The place gives off a very homey, small town, local feel. Coffee was refilled without us asking! Per the recommendation of our waitress, we ordered the Californian Omelet, banana bread and the Biscuits and Gravy. Yum!!! Good choices all around. The banana bread was super moist, flavorful and tasted so yummy with the whipped butter, The omelet is huge so I understand why people say that it's shareable. I highly recommend getting an omelet here just because the egg actually tasted different from a lot of other omelets I've had at other restaurants. It was really fluffy, light and flavored to perfection. The combination of avocado, egg and chorizo was right on the mark. The biscuit was lightly toasted and topped with a smoky flavored gravy that was so good. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Absolute best corned beef hash and eggs ever! Completely homemade (slow cooked) - not from a can - and just WOW! Comes with 2 eggs,  sliced potatoes and banana nut bread! Best breakfast I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"First, let me begin by saying Idk if this is the correct location I'm Yelping about. Vegas was a blur while I was there...  However, the plethora of omelets to choose from is RIDICULOUS! If you're an omelet enthusiast like myself, this place is heaven.  Since eggs are the best thing you can eat for a hangover (they soak up the toxins of alcohol) I was thoroughly satisfied with the ginormous omelet they gave me. I believe I had the chili verde omelet. You can order a small one if you can't handle the savage sized ones (only $10).  Everyone raves about this pumpkin bread and the verdict: it's pretty good. Not anything to say OMG about but definitely should get it since it's an option other than toast.  Not really a fan of the potato chip style spuds that come with the dish.  Good bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"My gf and I were craving some good breakfast foods and there was nothing on the strip that would satisfy our tummies unless we were ready to dish out some $$$.  So we decided to go out to the Las Vegas Premium outlets and found this place just a few blocks away.  It wasn't too hard to find as there was a huge sign out front and the decor gave it a real local's feel.  When we walked in the host was very friendly, asking us if we were from out of town and joking with us as he showed us to our table.  The coffee was good but the real kicker was the Banana Bread.  It came out piping hot and the texture was melt in your mouth.  And what is even more awesome as you can have it as a side if you order an Omelet!    As a main dish I had ordered the Cowboy Omelet which was all chili.  I decided to order this as there was a rodeo and the American Country Awards going on at the same time so I felt like getting into the festivities.  My girlfriend had ordered the Lox Benedict so that we can sample two of the top recommended dishes.  Both our orders came with a hefty side of home made potato chips that were delicious.  The Omelet wasn't heavy (as i thought it was going to be) and the chili portion was perfect to the size of the dish.  It wasn't too spicy but it was definitely satisfying.  The Lox was soft and the bread underneath wasn't soaking in the egg as it kept its fluffiness.    All in all it was a great little place to eat at if you are on the way to the outlets for a great meal and I definitely want to try the rest of the dishes there."}
{"text":"When I saw the photos on their website, I knew I had to try it out. The omelette looked huge, and it did not disappoint! First off, the restaurant was clean, bright, and very welcoming. I was comfortable eating here. Second, my waitress was friendly, noticed things like the design on my shirt and where I was from, and gladly gave suggestions for my meal. Very good service.  The omelette came out steaming hot, covered half the plate, and was packed with bacon, sausage, and ham (can't remember the name of the omelette but I believe it was #36). The potatoes were an interesting option, basically potato chips that weren't totally crispy. The options for bread are also amazing with choices like banana nut bread and pumpkin bread.    Finally, as I sat in my car ready to drive away, my waitress came sprinting out of the restaurant with my banana nut bread in hand (well, in the container I left on the table), making sure I didn't forget to take it with me! A+ for the extra effort. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Tasty and satisfying.   Cute and fulfilling breakfast/brunch restaurant. Portions were big. To compare, they are a bit larger than an omelet at IHOP.  I had the Cowboy Special. I would not order it again. It was tasty but chili was not to my liking. My favorite was the potato chip/fries! Loved those! My bf had the Californian and I liked that one much better. The avocado was fresh. I enjoyed that they weren't stingy with it; the omelet had plenty in it! My sister had the waffle, which I loved! It was fluffy and sweet, they consistency was perfect. I appreciated that it wasn't soggy or thin. The pumpkin bread I did not find as flavorful as I thought it would be after reading all the reviews. I found it to be bland.   Service wasn't anything out of the ordinary, if anything, the hostess walked by us twice before saying a word to us, which is quite rude. Acknowledge your customers. The waitress was more attentive.   I would go back to try a few other items on the menu!  Date of service: 9/13/2014"}
{"text":"Saw this place on our way to a dealership. The thought of stuffed blueberry french toast is out of this world. The banana bread smells are heavenly and the taste reminds me of something from grandmas kitchen. Prices were good as well pictures to follow....My poor hubby I couldnt stop eating his banana bread glad he shares."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I have no idea why anyone likes this place. Three friends and I went really hungry and left utterly disappointed. First let down was coffee. I love diner coffee but this was weak tea. I ordered the sausage gravy over biscuits and sadly it tasted like it was all from a can. The signature potato (sliced and friend) were cold. My friend had the stuffed french toast which was okay. It reminded me of IHop's. Other two had omelet and eggs benedict which were greasy."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great food! Portions are generous so come hungry! I was skeptical at first looking at he outside of the building, but it's what's inside that counts! This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Never disappointed in hearty, large menu. Had many of the omelette dishes with favorites being the porky pig and Denver. The skillet dishes are good also. The portions are such that sharing is cool which makes this a really good bargain on top of quality food. Service is old fashioned good with attentive staff."}
{"text":"Overall so tasty omelettes. And waffle. I liked the fact we had a choice between toast and pancake. Yes l would go back."}
{"text":"The perfect place to go for a wonderful breakfast or lunch, great food, large portions, home diner style, service is always top, you cant go wrong love the place"}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak with spuds is the bomb and fried zucchini is a must.  The staff has always been great; friendly and attentive.  Last time I went I had the Patty Page (patty melt) good stuff."}
{"text":"Looking for breakfast OFF the strip, come here! This place has HUGE portions and the works. It can, however, take long to get your food since this place is ginormous. We would recommend splitting a plate but they will charge extra if you do. However you can ask for a smaller portion for a dollar off.   My one hiccup with this place is that their coffee is watered down. This really is unfortunate but they refill you rather quickly.  Oh and this place looks like a museum of figurines. Definitely your granny's place :)"}
{"text":"This was a gem. Food was phenomenal and service was outstanding. Nice break-a-way from the Strip Food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A COCKROACH DECIDED TO JOIN US AT OUR BOOTH! We left a $5 on the table for the server & left. Managements explanation was that \"they'd just had pest control spray the previous night\". My immediate thought is this, though....if roaches are literally crawling on your guests tables...are they crawling everywhere in the kitchen too?"}
{"text":"Greasy average food. NOTHING LIKE the other location. Service was poor, bathrooms were in need of attention.  Eggs were not over easy and had to go back.  Will not return even on everything is free day!"}
{"text":"Eat the pumpkin bread!!! Drink the coffee! I had the shrimp omelette, I wish I would have tried something different..."}
{"text":"Rough on the outside sweet on the inside. The outside for you. If it is great and the waitresses were nice. Easy to split an omelette because they're so big"}
{"text":"The place is tucked away in a small shopping mall. There is plenty parking witch makes it nice. It does get crowded at times so you might have a wait but not very long.  The food is fairly priced and they do offer some good specials during the week. I ordered the pancake (flap) special that came with sausage and eggs. If you are craving hashbrowns or country style potatoes they do not serve them here, I found out. They do offer a freshly made potatoe chip. The service was also good and they always keep your cup full of coffee. If in the area stop by and you will find yourself around many of the locals."}
{"text":"It used to be great, now not so much. They took away their salad bar, they changed their hours and some of the waitresses are not that great. Who closes at 3pm during the week? Food is pretty good most days but the last few times it was very generic and the water tasted funny. I will try a different omelet house location instead of this one."}
{"text":"HUGE HUGE PORTIONS!! Not only that but the banana bread is to die forrrrrr. My favorite omelette from them is the Philly cheese steak. So much meat and yummy goodness inside. And they have chips as the side order that comes with it and that was crispy and tasted freshly made. I could eat those chips and banana bread all day. I'm definitely considering seeing if they sell a loaf of their banana bread. I also tried the pumpkin bread which is amazing as well but it wasn't as flavorful and tasty as the banana bread. Two people can definitely share one omelette. The lox eggs Benedict was also a huge portion. The salmon was actually cooked which took me by surprise because I'm used to a lox bagel with a raw smoked salmon instead of a cooked one but regardless it was still good. The sauce wasn't overwhelming or anything. The display of my eggs Benedict  was pretty funny. They put a black olive on each egg so it looked like boobs. I'd definitely come back! There are so many different omelettes on the menu to try."}
{"text":"1:30 on a Thursday. In town from Phoenix. This place has gold stars so we tried it. Waitress was pleasant. Food came in a decent amount of time. Food looked amazing. Food tastes amazing. We were starving and totally stoked we had found a cute little place. Towards the end of the meal I found a hair in my meal. It was literally stuck in the cheese in my eggs."}
{"text":"Service was perfect- Kelly was so friendly! The servings are huge and everything was delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great 1st time experience! Got to the restaurant at 11 am on a Sunday morning. Our wait was about 5 minutes. 3 adults ordered 3 breakfasts. 1 corned beef and eggs, 1 avocado omlette, 1 blueberry stuffed french toast with eggs. All 3 portions bigger than you usually get at most restaurants. Everything was hot. We tried both the pumpkin nut and bananna nut breads... Loved them both.  Servers never let our coffee get below 1/2 cup before offering refills. Friendly and engageing service associates. Our cost for 3 full breakfasts with coffee was $38.00. Overall, I could care less if you try it because you would be one more person I would have to wait behind the next time I go there, and I will go there again."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm eating breakfast in my grandmas kitchen! This is a breakfast gem in central Las Vegas. The staff is super personable and friendly. It makes me feel like I'm back in the south --- something I miss dearly. The food is delicious and home made ---- no complaints here!! Plus, the price is right!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Found this place one day while i was lost driving up and down Charleston Blvd., so i yelped it at a red light.  Glad i did too!  Its very country charming inside. You can tell as soon as you walk in its an older restaurant.  We ordered the country club omelette and the lobster benedict. Both were very satisfying. Looking at the pictures i wasn't excited about the potatoes...until i tried one...soooo good!! Prices weren't bad. Most omelets were $10.49 for the small omelette which has 3 whole eggs in it and ended up being a large portion. The large has 6 eggs.  There is a $1.49 charge to substitute egg whites.   Overall great experience...good food...friendly staff...We'll be back and would definitely recommend having breakfast here."}
{"text":"Bread:GOOOD Staff: super sweet and quick.  Location: not too far from the strip, worth coming out too.   Inside it does look old, but its a nice old school feel.   The food basically is priced right(not cheap, not expensive) but packs a punch.   I went with basic eggs and bacon with english muffin and it was perfect, but everything i tried from my buddies dishes were great."}
{"text":"Great big portions. Food was delish. It was the best Pumpkin bread we've had included with our breakfast."}
{"text":"I love close to this location and never tried it. So today was the day. The food was normal breakfast food. They have ALOT of Omelette options. However I ordered the French toast and my partner got the catfish. She said the Catfish was a tad over cooked. We got seated right away with no wait. It was a Wednesday late morning though. The only negative thing was it was FREEZING in there so make sure you bring something to cover up."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great homemade food and their bread is to die for.   A little pricey but a good value. Not sure why I don't get coupons for them like we do Ihops but still like to stop in here once in awhile"}
{"text":"Well... my Omelet was actually pretty good but there was a live fly in my mother's food. Also, coffee tasted like they used the same grounds twice. They reduced the bill for the order that had the fly but honestly they should have comped the entire bill. If they had I might not have posted this."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and tons of different omelet varieties! Go hungry cause they pile on the food. The pumpkin bread is delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a child and it is always yummy. It's a little hole in the wall straight out of the 70s but is so much bigger on the inside ( doctor who ish indeed) I love the spuds with the seasoning. I always ask for extra. They are always on the coffee rounds and the flap special is simple and delicious. I was served by a special lady today who understands the need for extra seasoning, her name is Shirley and has become my new favorite waitress here due to her awesome personality, attentiveness and love for spuds. I highly recommend this place. Also Torres the coffee lad is on his game. He never lets my drinks get low and is always so sweet. #classicvegasresturants #spudsforlife #win"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!  Based on yelp reviews stopped on the way to zion national park as just a few minutes off 15.  - food:  great. Pumpkin and banana bread both met our high expectations.  - omelettes: huge and excellent. You can easily share 1 and still be stuffed.  - ambience. . Looks like a bit of a dive on outside but the inside is classic diner.  Very nice.  - service. Friendly and attentive. Coffee and water was never empty.   We highly recommend and very well might stop again on our way back to the airport."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite breakfast places. I ordered the corned beef hash and a side of banana bread. However, I'm not a fan of the potato spuds. But anyway, everything else is really good. My friend ordered the lobster omelette (I never thought seafood and breakfast could mix), and it was so good! Can't wait to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Pumpkin bread. That's it! Omelette was great, everything was good, wait staff is fun and efficient, but that Pumpkin bread dragged me completely off my Keto diet.  I'm told the Banana Bread is just as good."}
{"text":"Pumpkin bread. Six egg omelettes that no human can finish. Friendly staff that keeps the coffee coming. There is no down-side to breakfast at the Omelet House. I'm only in Las Vegas once a year, but I always drop by at least once."}
{"text":"This place super amzing!!! Amazing food bang for ur buck. Super service best meal I had in Vegas a musssttttt!!!!!"}
{"text":"The banana nut Bread piping hot and amazing. Food was great eggs scrambled perfectly. Polish sausage fantastic. The spuds were different more like homemade potato chips, wish hash browns were an option overall it was one tasty dinner."}
{"text":"Hit this place at 12:20 on a Sunday. The parking lot was packed. Was able to find a spot next to the old lady walking in with a white and baby blue colored cane wrapped in plastic vines and flowers.   OMG this place is going to be amazing!  They don't take reservations, its first come first serve. There was a crowd of 10 ahead of our party of two. I thought about backing out but the pictures of the old celebrities charmed me back in.   The wood paneling and retro carpet kept my head on swivel and eyes dancing around the place. Curio cabinets, dishes, trinkets, grandmas house decor multiplied by a thousand! The heavy set patron sitting at the bench was equally attired for the place and when I asked her about the food, she rolled her eyes and said, \"please\". So we waited and got to the end of the line quickly (about 10 minutes) to come face to face with 3 state fair coin machines. Test your grip, your love it your athletics. I apparently I have a Wimpy Grip.   We were shown to our table that included a mini tour through the kitchen (which was spotless) to our booth. Lovely enough and situated in a well ventilated large room with enough seating for a company of Marines! What an experience!  The diverse patrons, the on point staff, the eclectic decor make this place a MUST.   The food ..... I'm rolling my eyes. Delicious. I had a number 39."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. I had the number 32. I barely finished the omelet, it had precooked turkey, stuffed with bagged guacamole and a side of greasy sliced potatoes sprinkled with very little seasoning. I had brown water, supposed to be coffee. My boyfriend's French toast was delicious, hard to mess up that. The service was okay. I would rather go to the coffee pub."}
{"text":"ENORMOUS PLATES, the servings are for giants super delicious, banana nut bread , pancakes, omelette sand more"}
{"text":"I work down the street, so my coworkers and I sometimes drop in for non-fast-food lunch.  We've always been happy with our omelettes and sandwiches.  The people tend to be friendly, service isn't slow, and the prices are average.  It's mostly out of convenience that we come here; not sure I'd go out of my way versus the other diners in town -- but I do love their spuds though -- yum!"}
{"text":"There decor will take you back. The huge omelettes will bring you back. The pumpkin bread is very good. There potatoes are the only thing I have not made my mind up about. Have not had a bad omelette yet"}
{"text":"First time to this omelet house. Little more sterile and chain store looking than the one further south on Boulder. Omelettes are the bomb. Had a Philly cheese steak omelet this time. Majorly delicious. I donated my pumpkin bread to my son. There potatoes are weird, even after a few visits I haven't made my mind up on them but the omelette will fill you up on its own anyways."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Oh i wish we had same place in LA! My fav breakfast place to go, when I am in Vegas. Everything here is good - service, food, prices. When we got there first time - they sit us at the Mayor of Las Vegas honorable table, which was really nice) Love it!"}
{"text":"It was great to meet my friends there, the service was meeting my expectations but the food not what I wanted because the order got wrong and it was cold. Not recommend when the food is not what you want."}
{"text":"Good is great.  Portions are huge.  Even the small omelette is big.  Love their style of home fries.  Waffles are delicious too."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem for breakfast! :) I came here with my mom after errands were done and the food is quite pleasing to the taste buds! We started with the Pumpkin Nut Bread......AMAZING! I don't usually say that about most places but this place....thumbs up. The bread was fluffy, warm and had just the right amount of walnuts. So that was a plus! My mom had a egg sandwich I believe which came with these thinly potato sliced potato chips. She raved about how good her sandwich was and you get a generous amount of portions of each! I wasn't extremely hungry so I stuck to the oatmeal with bananas and strawberries. I know it seems so simple but this was also quite delicious! Normally when I get oatmeal it's incredibly dry....thank goodness for this place! It was absolutely delicious and again you get a generous portion.   Service: Our server and service was okay in the beginning we were greeted with a different server who was peppy, but she politely asked the other server if that was her table. We wanted the other girl back. Other than that everyone worked well together and I was surely surprised about how packed it was! Coming back to try those omlettes for sure :)"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast ordered the \"38 omelet\" and it was delicious! They have home made banana nut bread which is also delicious! The customer service was great, they never let my coffee go below half way. Priscilla was our server and she was delightful. Gave us our space but still made sure we were taken care of. Will absolutely be returning back here whenever we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Portions are HUGE! The food is excellent and the service matches. Couldn't even drink my coffee down an inch before someone was refilling it. The wait time for a seat was fairly quick for a Sunday morning. It's definatly a popular place and I can see why. This is definitely our new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"So hard to get into this place! Once you are inside it reminds you of a raodside diner that a trucker would go to. After looking past all that, the waitresses are nice and efficient. The food is great, but you really need to order the zucchini. Ho-Li-Moly. The batter is hella good and it comes in long spears. Great for dipping!"}
{"text":"I got the Carnitas oddly it was definitely a 3/5 for me and my boyfriend got the flap jacks but for the amazing service and hospitality I would give it a 4/5"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Pumpkin bread and coffee before I got my omelet won me over!"}
{"text":"This was our first time going to the Omelet House. I was hoping for a really good lunch out as I am on a diet and allow myself a cheat day. I should have chosen a different place. While the people are very nice and the service was good, our food didn't come as ordered. I ordered chocolate chip pancakes. I got regular pancakes. Strike 1.. My husband ordered the kitchen sink omelet without chili. He got something with beef in a sauce in his omelet. Which wasn't explained to him when he asked what comes in it. Strike 2...Our 8 month old needed a highchair. What we got was a highchair with one of the bottom rungs broken. Strike 3... Will not be going back."}
{"text":"The reason for the 4 stars is because they have the lobster omelet on their menu. It's such a good deal and it's a big portion that I share it with my hubby. It comes with potatoes and a muffin. There's a charge for splitting an entree, so we usually just order an extra side and add my half of the omelet on that plate. It's just smarter to order that way. I also like ordering their food to go, considering it's right by my work."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! I was supposed to meet my BF, after 30 mins of him running late, the server suzette & the busser were not rude or rushing me. They actually were quite the opposite, made me feel like a usual customer, had conversations with me took my order, held his food. Very accommodating. Mr. Mills is hands on, helps his employees & welcoming. Portions are large & food is really tasty."}
{"text":"The portions are absolutely gigantic. Food is incredible, particularly the potatoes. Service is always swift and friendly. Make sure you ask for real cream for your coffee.  I always bring home 2/3 of my food and eat fit three days.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in Las Vegas. Fresh eggs and the banana nut bread is off the charts"}
{"text":"Really good if you are hungry the omelettes are 6 eggs I had the kitchen sink it had everything in it it was so good.would have taken a pic but I was hungry lol"}
{"text":"I always enjoy this restaurant the food is always good and I specially love the balloon lady she's great for kids and"}
{"text":"First visit here--decided to order the chicken fingers and some fried zucchini. I absolutely love fried zucchini, so of course I had to try it from here. The restaurant was very busy when I stopped by, but the hostess at the front was so nice and friendly! I wanted to order to go and she took my order right away. I only waited 7-10 minutes and then my order was ready to go! Amazing! Again the hostess was so kind in packaging my order to go. This place definitely makes you feel very welcome. The serving sizes here are huge! Good thing I was sharing my order with some friends! The chicken was great--very tasty and moist. The fried zucchini was also very good. I will say it doesn't have much zucchini in it though; it is probably 70% dough to 30% zucchini. It was for sure different than fried zucchini I've gotten elsewhere. The dough was light and airy and not super greasy. I'd for sure come back here for breakfast or lunch. They have a lot of things on the menu that look good."}
{"text":"Crazy portions! That was the first thing that came to my mind once I was given my plate of food. I ordered a carnitas omelette and the flavor was really good. It also had a great proportion of meat to egg. The omelette came with a side of fries that was also very good and plentiful.   The omelette I ordered was about $10. I think this is a fair price for the amount of food you receive. I ended up taking half of my portions back home. I decided that when I visit this establishment again with the hubby, we are only ordering one plate and sharing.   Overall, we also received great service. Our waitress was very attentive when it came to refilling our glasses and coffee. This is a place I plan to come back to. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We came here early one morning b/c my love wanted to try the 3 lb burger. UM no.. But an omelet sounded pretty good. However, I ordered the blueberry stuffed pancakes. I was picturing real blueberries. I was wrong. It was more of a blueberry compote sugar solution. It was good but after 2 or 3 bites its just too sweet for my taste. Someone w/ more of a sweet tooth probably would have enjoyed this more.   My bf ordered the bugsy siegal. It was huge. He loved it. To me it looked very busy and piled high. Every man's dream! gotta say not only was a ton of food but it also came with toast or pumpkin bread or banana bread. he went w/ wheat toast and it was a very full meal.   We have since gone to the new one that is way closer to our house. like 3 minutes. or w/in walking distance and we have walked there a few times. See that review fmi :)"}
{"text":"I live so close to this location and mybf and I have walked here a few times. The 1st time I came was on a Sat. afternoon and my bf ordered the .38 special and I went with the Sorry Charlie -tuna sandwhich, which was delicious by the way! dang that was good. I gandered around the salad bar which is only half full.. I guess tahts smart b/c everything on the salad bar looked incredibly fresh.  Cold salads, pudding, fresh beautiful looking fruit, strawberries and grapes, etc. They also had a frozen yogurt maker for their dessert bar. I was kinda thinking man, I wish I had just gotten the salad bar. It sure beats sweet tomatoes prices $5.99 v.s 9.99 -   2nd trip: Well the 2nd time I went I again wanted the salad bar but... I was a lil more hungry that day than I was the previous visit. So I went for the Cowboy special. Yes I am I dallas cowboys fan! this was chilli w/ egg and cheddar cheese, hold the onion. It was good but I woudlnt order it again. I pictured the chilli thicker like Wolf brand chili and it was rather runny with chunks of meat. Not really what I envisioned, but doesnt mean you wouldnt like it.   Pumpkin bread: Wow, that deserves a paragraph of  its own. enough said.   I highly recommend this place. staff is always friendly and they have neat posters around the place of the Dunes, etc. I like it. One of these days I will try the salad bar and I might up then one more star!  also note: they lose one star for closing soo early on sundays. thats why we dont go more often. It closes @ 9 during the week and like @ 2 on sundays."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! It was busy but they got us in quickly. Amanda was our waiter and she did an excellent job. Helped us on what to get and the food is so delicious. French toast with choc chips! Awesome family style restaurant"}
{"text":"My family and were in Vegas recently and decided to not shell out 100 dollar bills for mediocre meals so I googled this place and we LOVED it. I ordered some HUGE Omelet with lots of stuff in it and my wife and kids ordered Veggie Omelets and we were stuffed. The food was delicious and well worth the trip. It's like 15 minutes off the strip on the freeway going N but navigation it and ENJOY. A great breakfast and MUST stop every time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Servings are huge and delicious! The banana bread is OMGahhhhh yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very solid breakfast, great value, and a lot of choices.  And, since opening up the other location at Boulder and Russell, this Omelet House is not nearly as crowded, so wait times are way down.  That's a definite plus, we've waited awhile before.  I typically get the chicken fried steak and eggs.  Good gravy, I ask for more on the side.  It's traditional sausage cream gravy with good pepper flavor.  I like the spuds, their fried potatoes, but I typically find the seasoning a little lacking.  So, I also ask for more seasoning on the side.  It's a good seasoning, not just your traditional seasoning salt.  My wife gets the stuffed french toast lately, but we both have had omelets (of course).  As many note, they are large, and a half, or \"baby,\" is what my wife orders.  We also get it to go pretty frequently.  When ordering to go, they usually tell me 10 minutes, and they are spot on.  It's usual for me to be walking in the place while they are packing up the order.  Dine in or carry out, we will definitely be back to the Omelet House."}
{"text":"When I walked in I thought for a second I was at an IHOP built in the 1980s, but this place proved to be so much more. The menu was filled with dozens of different omelet choices with creative names. After much debate, I decided to go for the Plymouth Rock, filled with delicious turkey and guacamole. The omelet was gigantic, there was at least 5 eggs there, served with tons of potatoes. A choice of pumpkin or banana bread was offered. I went with the pumpkin, which was divine. The service was excellent, with coffee refills being offered at an moment. So happy to have found this place! I'll definitely be back..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the newest one in the Omelet House chain, a chain that has had restaurants around the Vegas Valley for years. It is at the Boulder/Russell intersection, in the building that previously housed Sizzler.  My mother wanted to try this place so me, her, and my girlfriend went last night. After our experience last night, I would say that eating at this place wasn't exactly a revelation, but I certainly would not be opposed to going back.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is quite good, with a sort of \"country kitchen\" feel to it, and posters/artwork/etc. of assorted American icons (actors, singers, airplanes, etc.) They even sell some of this sort of stuff at the front counter. My only real complaint with the atmosphere is that, despite the wide, spacious restaurant space, the hostess seemed to insist on seating everyone in the restaurant very close together. Given the lack of customer traffic last night, I wish she had seated us a little further apart.  The menu is HUGE. Like Sizzler that occupied this space before, there is a good-sized salad bar here. As the name of the restaurant implies, the place prides itself on its omelets, and they have tons of options for those. If you're not into salads or omelets though, they have plenty of other choices as well, including pasta and meat dishes. Everything I tried last night was solid, in particular the home-cooked \"spud\" french fries.    The service in the restaurant was good. Not the best I have ever had, but definitely solid. At times they were pretty slow refilling my water, but everyone in the restaurant had a positive attitude. However, I did hear a waitress tell another customer who requested some drink on display at the front of the restaurant that they had to get those items from up there, separately, and that there was some policy that wouldn't allow them to serve said items directly to the customers at their dining tables. Don't know what the hell was up with that.   Still, in the end, this was an excellent dining experience. Not the best I've ever had, but I'll more likely than not end up coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"Came here on recommendations from Yelp. When we got here on Sunday morning, they said the wait would be 10-15 minutes, but we ended up getting seated within 5.   The service here was the best. We weren't limited to one waitress; multiple waitresses stopped by to ask if everything is okay, to fill our coffees, to clear our plates, and to bring us things we asked for.   I split the corned beef hash and apple cinnamon french toast with one other person and it was more than enough food. The corned beef hash was probably some of the best I've ever had! The meat was very lean and partially cubed; not too salty, but very tender and tasty. The potatoes they came with were awesome; like a thick-cut potato chip, reminiscent of a potato wedge. The apple cinnamon french toast was just okay. It ended up being a little too heavy for both of our tastes with the cream cheese filling. Coffee, though refilled a lot, was a bit watered down for my tastes.   Overall, I'd definitely return! The service here was great and they had a large menu with large portions."}
{"text":"Waking up early has never been my sort of thing, but lately the Big F and I have been able to clamber out of bed just in time to grab brunch at these various restaurants blanketing this city.  Omelet House was on our agenda last weekend and we were worried when we saw a crowd outside.  Lucky us, no wait though on this Sunday afternoon.  Beyond all the breakfast items, they have sandwiches, homemade soups and chili, fried zucchini, chicken fingers, and burgers.  Although we were tempted by #33 \"Flatlanders Special\" for $69, the Big F couldn't say no to the \"Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs with Sausage Gravy\" for $8.39 with his eggs over easy.  I went for #35 \"Egg White Special\" for $8.89, an \"egg white omelet stuffed with mushrooms, spinach, zucchini, and tomatoes.\"  For 79 cents off, I had the \"Baby Omelet\" making it a smaller dish.  Other choices than the toast include English muffins, homemade pumpkin nut bread, banana nut bread or tortillas!  The most unique thing about our meals was the potatoes.  They were almost sliced thin enough to be considered homemade potato chips.  In a way it was cool, but I guess it would have been good to know too.  Overall, it was a satisfactory brunch choice.  We didn't think it was extraordinary, but it worked.  You'll find a lot of older folks at this place too, which to me means it has some staying power over the years.  They are a couple of kid specials too!  And on your birthday, the meal is on them!  Just bring at least one paying friend!  (Pics of our brunch are posted!)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place for a Sunday breakfast. We usually go for the omelettes, but enjoy the pancakes and the banana bread is to die for. We started splitting an omelette lately, because they are huge."}
{"text":"Truly the best corned beef hash i've had in a long time."}
{"text":"This is the newest addition to the Omelet House Family. It is also located on N. Boulder Hwy but it is located a little more north at Russell and Boulder.   Slightly hung over one morning a friend and I went to grab some good food to start the day off right. She wanted Roberto's so we pulled up to the drive thru got our breakfast burritos and started to drive home. All of the sudden she freaked out, \"THE NEW OMELET HOUSE IS OPEN!!! WE HAVE TO GO WE MUST GO!\"   I got very excited because we just bought food, still hot in my lap, and this place made her want to forget that just so we could eat here. SO we dropped the food off at home put some real pants on and went to Omelet House.   No being a virgin to this place I had no idea what kind of reputation the other locations had. I heard all about it as we ordered and got our food.   I was blown away. Warm Banana Nut Loaf, an Omelet as big as my head, and the BEST Potato Spuds. As other yelpers have said- they are magical and addictive. I had the Guac omelet with guacamole tomatoes and cheddar cheese, my friend had the health nut with jalapenos.   We both didn't finish it all, and ended up only taking the left over loaf home since we had breakfast burritos still waiting for us.   The building is nice and had an eclectic feel to it full of ceramic roosters and other pictures all over its walls. This building use to be a Sizzler so you will still see the Salad Bar chillin in the center of the restaurant. I know by the end of this month they are going to start serving dinner so hopefully it will get some use. Its roomy and inviting to say the least.   And don't worry the manager said they won't be closing any of the other locations so you can still get all your favs in the usual spot.  I am looking forward to going back here, and if you are a virgin like I was bring your appetite and head on down to the Omelet House!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast, awesome omelets, huge portions and always great staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a breakfast on the way Hoover Dam.  Boy, did we get lucky! They not only had my requirement: eggs whites, oatmeal and whole wheat toast, and tea, but they also had these incredible things they call\"spuds\", which are fresh made potato chips for He, and fresh strawberries for She.  All this, huge ham slice, etc, etc, ask for less than $ 25.  Whoohoo!  Bookmarked for another trip."}
{"text":"I like this place.  We had a pastrami hamburger, chicken sandwich, and chicken soup.  All were quite tasty and reasonably priced. I will definitely stop by again when I am in town."}
{"text":"This place was a gem that we found while out in Vegas. It was very busy on the strip due to spring break and we did not feel like waiting over 2 hours for Hash House. I found this place on Yelp and boy am I happy I did! We drove maybe 10 minutes from our hotel and got seated within less than 5 minutes. Everyone is very nice and our waitress Valerie was a sweetheart! She recommended the pumpkin muffin that came with my husband's omelette meal, and she even cut it in half so we could share. Valerie also let me know my waffle had come out a little burnt so she had them make me a new one and brought out my eggs and sausage while I waited.   I got the waffle special and it was so delicious! Very big portions so we also have yummy leftovers for our drive back home. We also got a side of biscuits and gravy and it wasn't the BEST I had, a little salty, but the biscuit was really good. You could tell everything was freshly made. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great food and huge portions ! The staff is nice and inviting, the dinner is adorable !"}
{"text":"Second time here and just like the first time had an amazing experience! The place is really unique and the staff is great! You can tell that all the staff work together as a team and help each other out with making sure your drink cup never goes half way down. I noticed my cup never got half empty because they were always on top of making sure it was full. The food is very tasty and affordable  for the huge portions you get! Will be coming back soon and recommending it to others!"}
{"text":"The Freshen Up is a tasty light drink. Ask for Cece, shes the best."}
{"text":"Went for specifically breakfast food and portions were large,  with mixed reviews in our party. I am quite particular and found omelets (tasted two) mediocre at best.  However,  when I ordered eggs over medium  (whites set and yolks warm and runny) I was pleased. Toast arrived cool and butter cold so it didn't melt. Breakfast potatoes, which I asked for crisp, were soggy and flavorless. Service was tolerable - waitress seemed to lack interest in providing quality service which was disappointing. If I had another alternative for breakfast nearby and NOT fast food I'd opt out of returning."}
{"text":"I really love the lobster eggs Benedict here and the home fried potatoes that come with it are excellent. I highly recommend for the food. Service was a little rushed which I get, it is a \"turn and burn\" kind of place but did feel a little rushed but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The pumpkin bread was very good as was the lobster Benedict.  However the French toast, pancakes and omelet were below average.  Service was good as the coffee cup remained full.  Note that there is a very limited kids meal."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long time. My go 2 breakfast spot from now on. Nick was our waiter and he was awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"Egg-cellent! Had corned beef hash & eggs. Was served with home made potato chips & choice of bread. Toasts, pumpkin, or banana bread. Oh the bread is warm. My husband hadcthe Liberty Bell omellette which is basically a cheesestesk omellete. It was gi-normous! 6 eggs to make it. Server was sweet. Her section as packed but she was so attentive & kind. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll be having breakfast here."}
{"text":"Oh Omelet House how I love thee let me count the ways..or in this case Omelets!  If you love breakfast, this is the place. They have every omelet combination under the sun and they are huge! I've had several of their omelets and they are all scrumptious, but my favorite item on the menu is the Eggs Benedict Florentine. It comes on a perfectly toasted English muffin with spinich, mushrooms, poached eggs & a yummy hollindaise sauce!! I always ask for avacodo on it too!  Mmmm their hand cut spuds are an excellent side item. I love to dip them in ketchup! Their bread is also yummy! I prefer the rye bread, but they also offer pumpkin bread that looks good too.  Omelet House's staff is so friendly and attentive to all your needs. They never let your coffee cup get empty. I've been to other locations, but this one is my favorite. If you come on a weekend morning be prepared to wait! It's totally worth it though!   Omelet House never disappoints when your looking for a filling & yummy breakfast!"}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here and a great lunch here.  The decor at this place is quirky.  The food is fresh and hot and the servers friendly.  We were impressed.  The pumpkin bread is wonderful, omelettes wonderful and the cajun chicken was good too.    I saw some people ordering the fried steak and chicken which looked a little too decadent for us.  We would definitely go back here if we were in Vegas again."}
{"text":"The Chicken Fried Steak Omelete by far the best I've ever had! This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"The chili verde omelet was wonderful. Don't let the crowd waiting to get in scare you off. The lines moves fast & the food is scrumptious. The locals know!"}
{"text":"Lobster Omelet with egg whites was delicious. Seriously.   Parking is somewhat hard to find in this plaza.   It's like a huge house inside."}
{"text":"Not only was the food too greasy but they wouldn't accept our Entertainment coupon because they said it was a holiday which wasn't true. This was a Sunday, the day before Veteran's Day. I thought the point of such coupons was to build a customer base, not piss people off by making up weird rules and then quibbling about them. Never again Omelet House! Never again!"}
{"text":"It was right before our team photo shoot and we were hungry!  We decided to go to the Omelet House as it offered either breakfast or lunch.  We have approximately 72441675267 Omelet House locations in Vegas and I've never been to one before so I was excited for the Yelp review opportunity.    When I parked, I was a little sketched out.  It's in a very interesting strip mall in the back corner.  When I walked in, I noticed a very outdated, old place.  Stain carpets all over the place, light wood all over the place.  In the front area, there are benches to sit on and next to it, you have a glass case with miss matched items for sale.  The place is seriously outdated and the perfect opportunity for a modern makeover.  I was expecting a staff that was older, who probably worked there since they opened back in 1954 (date is incorrect and placed there only for joking purposes).  What I got instead, was a variety of older and super young hip looking servers.  Our server was a tall, skinny guy, good looking and younger.  He was seriously an awesome server.  Super attentive to his tables, super nice and when our food came out, he took the time to review his notes and give us our plates, without yelling the order out to the table.  As a previous server myself, I really appreciated that.  He didn't have a name tag, so I can't call his name out in this review.  It didn't stop there.  The other supporting servers around, took part in helping each other out.  Refilling our coffees, checking to see if we need anything throughout our meals.  I loved the service!!    For my meal, I teamed up with a coworker and got the following (Don't judge):  The Californian omelet and added onions and mushrooms for $9.99, the Eggs Benedict Florentine for $9.79 and a Full Stack Buttermilk Pancakes for $6.39.  Let's start with the omelet.  It was HUGE!!  Sausage, avocado and jack cheese with onions and mushrooms.  What a beautiful omelet.  You literally can save a half for later.  Jack cheese is the best cheese for this type of omelet. So savory, so good!  The Eggs Benedict has two medium eggs, with spinach and mushrooms and topped with their light Hollandaise sauce.  I love me a good Benedict and this one was no exception.  Although the Hollandaise sauce is light, they did pack on.  It was super flavorful, but maybe just a little too much.  The spinach and mushrooms took the Benedict to a whole new level, I was loving it!!!  Then you have their pancakes.  Three large cakes, super fluffy and moist.  Their syrup seems store bought, but it came to our table warm so it really made the cakes amazing!  Highly recommend these dishes!  The moral of the story, don't ever judge a book by it's cover.  This place is a gem.  When you're in the area, hang a right into the parking lot, grab a table and check them out.  You will not be disappointed!!!  I wasn't :)  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"3 words: biscuits and gravy! I'm not kidding, I would smuggle their biscuits out by the dozen if I could!! Wish it wasn't 90 minutes away. Loved eating there. It's a typical diner atmosphere but the food is stellar!!"}
{"text":"I like the kitchy atmosphere and the old servers who have been here for ages. I dunno, it's just a good, \"loved\" vibe about and it was bumping with a mix of people from club kids to old timers who probably have been coming every Sunday since '79.    I got the lobster egg benedict and the BF got a Joes Special- which the menu lists with \"ground beef, spinach, garlic, onion & jack cheese and secret seasonings\" .  It was decent benedict, very homey, diner benny with a solid hollandaise.  I like that their potatoes are a cross between potato chips and griddle scalloped potatoes.   BF couldnt finish his omelet. It was a hefty portion though I see now you can order a \"baby\" size which still is quite a portion. His omelet was pretty tasty from the bites I tried. It has fluffy egg which is my big schtick with many places who make it so well done it just gets too dense.  Best part is they have something for everyone with their extensive menu. It took us quite a while to decide and probably will each time. Now that we at least tried the breakfasts, I will try to order a lunch entree next time.  This place was so hyped up by people that I was afraid to go, but I think it's a solid comfort food breakfast spot with friendly, family establishment hospitality."}
{"text":"We have come here a bunch of times and ALWAYS enjoy our food and the service. Even on a busy day, we get seated quickly and our food comes out fast. The food is always hot and delicious.  Today, I am not writing a review for the food or the service, but one waitress in particular. We have had this waitress a few times and she is always happy&welcoming and she makes an effort to get to know us. On June 22nd, I was standing outside when I overheard her come out and ask a guy (who was sitting in the heat, outside reading a paper) if he would like to come inside and have a meal on her. He gave her a very excited \"Yes!\" and she welcomed him in. She did NOT have to do this and I thought it was so sweet.   Definitely going to be speaking to management about this waitress and her choice to go above and beyond."}
{"text":"I love this place from the bottom of my heart. Omelets are amazing. I ordered the Kitchen Sink one time and actually ate the entire thing- I was impressed with myself, but I was also well impressed by the omelet. It was delicious and each bite was full of meat and vegetables. Most people do not finish this dish.    They do not have hash browns but they have spuds, which are just as good but ask for them well-done as they served me soggy, greasy ones last time, even though I asked for them to be well-done.   The burgers here are really good, too. Medium-rare burger actually comes out pink in the middle. It's huge, juicy and thick. Our first time here, we ordered burgers because the woman next to our table was eating one and we were jealous.   Everyone's food that passes by makes me jealous but I always love what I end up with! Except for those greasy, soggy and cold spuds, I've never had a bad experience here. They were too busy today so we opted for Jimmy John's, instead."}
{"text":"My favorite Las Vegas Breakfast place. I've lived here for almost 20 years and have tried them all. Non compare. My favorite is their eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"I missed this place so much. Seriously stop by and have one of the best breakfasts ever. My favorite is the Verde burrito, but ask for Verde nachos. They are amazing. Thanks so much for staying an awesome breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Exceptional restaurant. The closest to home cooking that you can find. I caught the owner bussing tables! A pleasant fellow that keeps the place moving. Our waitress, Cassandra, was a beauty with a pleasant disposition. The portions were huge. The price was in the average range but the quality was very good!"}
{"text":"After an amazing 3 mile jog this morning we were hungry and not In the mood to go home and cook. This place is on the way home and close to home so very convenient. We have been here previously but being ripped off has stopped me from returning. ( See my last review to see why )   This morning i thought I would give them another chance and it was definitely better than my last visit. We were seated immediately and I had to use the little girls room , my boyfriend as well since we had just finished out workout. ( don't eat your germs ! lol ) I hate it when a bathroom has push on/off sinks. What's the point of washing your hands when you have to turn the water back on midway washing your hands to finish rinsing. I might be being dramatic but it's annoying to me. They also didn't have any toilet seat liners :/. I had to ask for some. That's no fun.   Anyways we sat down and decided what to eat. Our server Cheryl was very friendly and prompt to take our order. I needed a few minutes. I knew I wouldn't order chili verde again since I got barely any meat last time. After placing out order we received the pumpkin nut bread that are with my meal. Even though it's officially October I love pumpkin anything any time of the year.   Pumpkin Bread - you could see the steam coming off the bread it was hot and ready to devour. Baked with walnuts it was so yummy. Slapped some butter on that and shared with my boyfriend. It was a huge piece too.   Blueberry stuffed French toast - two thick cut pieces of French toast stuffed with blueberry compote and cream cheese. Not overly sweet and still worthy of maple syrup. Served with two eggs he went for over easy and your choice of bacon or sausage. The French toast does not come with spuds so he ordered a side.   Spuds - a cross between chips and fries. Super yummy. They come sliced in pieces like chips so you can dip them in ketchup or ranch. I dipped mine in ranch. So good. That ranch. Oh man that's some good ranch. I could eat that stuff all day. But I won't.   Phillysteak Omelet - huge omelet stuffed with steak meat , peppers , onions , mushrooms  & cheese. They definitely gave me some meat this time I was afraid I wouldn't get any due to my last experience. This was good it was just lacking seasoning. It was bland. I just sprinkled a little salt on the inside and it was fine. Especially after slapping some ketchup and cholula on it.   We shared the French toast and the omelet and still had food leftover. The service was good and the food definitely better than last time. With it being close to home I will be back now as last time I stated I wasn't sure. Just don't let me down in the future ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered the omelette with onions, bacon, cheese, and tomatoes. The size was huge and it was cooked to perfection. The potatoes are nice and crunchy. The service was great. I will be back and highly recommend anyone come and get an omelette, it was super!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and each time has been a really good experience! Definitely a place with a lot of history. As the name would suggest, this place has fantastic omelets- my favorite would have to be the Mexi-Cali (with a boatload of hot sauce) or the King of Hearts. Would recommend doing the \"baby\" size- the name is totally wrong, it's still a huge omelet! Also of note, their omelets come with fresh, seasoned potato chips- which are really delicious and I'd highly recommend- but, I suppose, that's not for everyone and they do have alternatives. Overall, I definitely do like this place a lot. It's never going to be a super trendy brunch spot and it's not trying to be; this is the type of place you go with family or friends to relax and catch-up- it's super friendly, quiet, and delicious."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place to get stuffed !"}
{"text":"The original Omelet House,  on Charleston,  started it all.  This kitschy Henderson location has been on Boulder Highway since the 80's and is a locals favorite.    Today I tried their new carnitas omelet and WOW.   Could be my new favorite and I've been eating omelets here for 20 years.  I added avocado because,  you know,  avocado.    The carnitas are big,  juicy chunks of tender pork. The eggs are fluffy perfection and the tangy ranchero sauce is it's crowning glory.    Btw, this order in my photo is the 'baby size '... I'll be boxing it up.  Lol! Love their signature home fries... basically a well seasoned potato chip. I recommend choosing the hot pumpkin bread or banana bread as your side.  It's homemade and very special.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Omelet House is old-school Vegas. As expected,  omelets feature prominently with approximately 40 varieties to choose. Other breakfast classics are done well.  You can go every weekend and never get bored.  The corned beef hash is one favorite off-omelet offerings but honestly,  the omelets are where my taste buds lead me nearly every time. Signature sides of thinly sliced potatoes,  crispy and seasoned and homemade pumpkin or banana nut bread round out my plate.  The many of the servers have worked at this friendly, locally owned family business and it contributes nicely to a warm atmosphere.  I love bringing out of town guests here for breakfast or brunch.  Expect a bit of a wait to be seated as demand for a great breakfast in this popular, homey establishment."}
{"text":"Cute breakfast place. Was staying in Vegas for the weekend and tried this place. Yummy food. HUGE portion sizes. The potatoes were also really tasty. Coffee refills came faster than any place I've been to. Friendly staff, will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The waitress was quite nice. The potato chips are awesome. The rest of our food was just ok, nothing spectacular. Place is very old school. It was an ok breakfast in general here ..."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Went with a large group, very accommodating staff, fast, and friendly service. Portions were huge!  Everything was delicious, pumpkin bread, pancakes, deep fried zucchini, and omelets had by alll, and not one complaint!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! I had the healthnut omelet with avocado and it was so good! I just wish I would have ordered the baby omelet size, I barely finished half of the omelet. Lol. The homemade chips they give you with your omelet were delicious! Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy, but quickly seated me in a clean, comfortable booth. Coffee and water were promptly served. I tried the country Benedict with the gravy on the side. It was excellent. The potatoes were homemade crispy chips. The sausage, biscuit, and eggs complemented one another. I am glad that I had the gravy on the side so that I could adjust the amount. I used some of the gravy as a dip for the potatoes. I recommend this restaurant for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Be warned the omelets are 6 egg omelets, unless you order a baby, that's 3 eggs. Good portions, the spuds are house made potato chips, salty and delicious. Service was good and prices were very reasonable. Loved their lobster omelet. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for breakfast. I had the Ham and Bean soup and it was just like my mom's home made. Thick and flavorful. Girlfriend had the bacon and cheese omelet which was very good loaded with Bacon and Cheese. We will be back. Prices are awesome. We like Hash house a go go but it's just to exspensive. This is our new breakfast place when we visited Vegas"}
{"text":"Yelp proves again to be a trustworthy travel partner!  Heading out of Vegas to the Hoover Dam, we decided we wanted something more interesting and cost-effective than the buffets. Omelet House did not disappoint, and was worth the drive.  His plate: meat lover's omelet  Her plate: green chili omelet, 'baby size' - pulled pork and green chili, ordered without the cheese  The choice of pumpkin bread instead of toast was welcomed - and worth it! Green chili was fantastic, pork was not too fatty and really just perfect. His omelet was well received as well, however if we go back we'd both order 'baby size' since it's an overwhelmingly large plate regardless!  Fried potatoes instead of traditional homefries - a great textural contrast, and I thoroughly enjoyed dipping them in my green chili! We'll be back again, even if we're not heading to the touristy Dam!"}
{"text":"Omelet House is one of our favorite Vegas finds - we stopped at one of their other locations on a past trip out to take some pictures at the Hoover Dam, and they were the Yelp suggestion for a good local breakfast. We were thrilled to find another location with the same great menu right in town, and visited twice on our last trip.  I'm particularly fond of the green chile sauce, whether it be in the pork chili verde omelet or just on the side. D has alternated between breakfast food and the lunch special sandwiches, and we both really love the breakfast potatoes. They're unevenly cut, which means a perfect blend of crispy thin slices and tender thicker ones.  Service is friendly and prompt, and we feel great about having a flavorful local meal instead of overpriced and underflavored hotel breakfast."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've ever been to! Biscuits and gravy were the best I have ever had and their sausage patties are so so good. I will definitely be back every time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"What a find  All thanks to yelp , one of the best breakfast place in town , away from the maddening breakfast buffets in Las Vegas . Banana bread/pumpkin bread is a must  And you can't go wrong with any of the omelets choices . Don't get deceived by the outside appearance. Staff and our server were very welcoming . Loved it"}
{"text":"If you're looking for ginormous portions in a homestyle setting, Omelet House is the jam. You can't get much different from the the ritzy Vegas Strip than this!  As the name of the business indicates, tons of egg/omelet options to choose from. Almost too many! Denver Omelets, Crab Omelets, Bacon Omelets... which one sounds best?   The burger. Get the burger! 1/2 pound of beefy goodness in a bun. With a side of potatoes. Have someone in your party order an egg creation and you can switch halfway through your meal. Then you have absolutely nothing to complain about.  For the price, this place is a steal! Average tab per person comes out to about $12 each. And unless you're a \"big bunch\", there's no way you can finish everything on your plate the first time around. Make sure to tip your waitress extra for all of the refills and sweet as pie service."}
{"text":"Love the rustic homey feel.  Food is great, portions are huge and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"If you want a restaurant that possesses the recipe for success... here it is!  Nostalgic Vegas is alive and these guys have been serving amazing food since 1979.  Melia was our server and she was not only awesome, she was genuinely friendly and down to earth.  We ordered the California omelette, pancakes, and their homemade corn beef hash...wow!  It was all delicious and I'd go back just for the hash.  The home made salsa was some of the best I've ever had.   Ok... now put this place in your contacts and get off the Vegas strip... it's off the beaten path."}
{"text":"I'm assuming this is a hungover or now that marijuana is legal, some sort of smokers dream place. For us sober folks, stay away. The food was so freaking greasy!! The amount of cheese used was fatal and the flavor was nonexistent.   Decor: It could use an update. There were random trinkets and roosters all over the place. It was dark and could severely use some sunlight and windows. The lack of windows gave it a mildew-like dark feeling.   Cleanliness: The gentleman to the right cleaned off a table then put the bare silverware for that table on the cleaning rag, then picked it up from the rag and placed it for seating of the new guests... I stopped eating right then!!"}
{"text":"A Vegas institution with expertly executed breakfasts and other traditional comfort food. They are known for their fried zucchini sticks with good reason, a delectable light crispy batter seasoned just right makes these a hit.  The pumpkin nut bread ($1.99) will take you back in time, yeah, go ahead and add the butter, it's ok. Decor is straight out of a midwestern restaurant you would find in the country...lots of wood, chickens, and cheesy murals, makes you feel like your at grandma's house. Most items priced around $5-$10, service is speedy and friendly."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!! This place is amazing! We had a party of 7 on a summer Sunday at 12 and we're seated in 20 minutes. The service was phenomenal! Our party had 2 adults, 2 teens, 2 tweens and a 5 year old. The menu was full of options for everyone and the portions were so large we split a certain yoke of meals and still had left overs. Don't forget to try their banana nut bread! It melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I split the kitchen sink omelet. The omelette was huge and stuffed with just about  everything. Delicious, filling, cheap, and the customer service was good too. This was a welcome change up to the huge buffet lines. ****"}
{"text":"Anything omelet! This place is great if your looking for EGGS breakfast! Flavors are great. Portions are as big as the plate. Omelets come with fresh homemade potato chips. And choose the homemade banana bread or the pumpkin bread that comes with it. I say share the plate! I'm a huge coffee drinker and that took one of the stars down. Coffee was very weak, if the coffee was just a little bit better this place should of gotten a 5 star. Price was was great for what you get. We got the 38 special, country fried omelet and the kitchen sink. Place is a small old school place. Servers are awesome!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with my family, and we all loved it. The portions were enormous, and our server was both helpful and prompt. If you like big breakfasts, you should definitely go here"}
{"text":"I came to the Omelet House with about 15 girlfriends during a road trip to Vegas!! From the time we walked in, we were greeted & pampered  by the owner(we didn't know she was at the time).  This place is, hands down THE best breakfast place in the area!!! Their lobster omelette is to die for and their fresh baked bread is also out of this world.    The food AND service was so amazing, we came here 2 days in a row!   ANY time I'm anywhere near Vegas...I will be stopping by here & so should you!!"}
{"text":"FIVE starts truly are not adequate for this place.  I would give them 100 if I could.  Family owned & operated.  From the moment you walk into the door, throughout your meal, til the time you pay & leave...everything is perfect.  The customer service here is equal to black level American Express....   Everyone here cares that you have THE very best experience possible.  You NEVER have to ask for something twice, NEVER have to wait for someone to clear things off your table...NEVER ask for a refill on coffee or water.    The staff is warm, friendly & funny!   I haven't even gotten started on the food.  There will NEVER be a time when I visit Vegas and don't come to Omelet House!    Thank you Owner Kevin and everyone here.  You guys all truly have a special place in my heart...and in my stomach!! The lobster omelet IS fantastic! The house made banana bread is to die for.   Get your butt to the Omelet House if you are ANYWHERE near Vegas...you will NOT be sorry."}
{"text":"Came here before going home to California. Everything was so fresh and hot. Customers service was great. Will definitely be back whenever im in Vegas"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat, the food here is amazing and the portions are huge. Their breads are also wonderful. The servers are normally very helpful and attentive, save for one occasion I came here. You can't really go wrong with going here."}
{"text":"Coffee was like water and warm, even after I requested for a change. Pancake syrup was runny. As I poured it over the pancake there was like a film over it and once that was broken, it just exploded on the pancake. Yuck. The only reason I gave this place a 2 star was because the server was really pleasant."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for breakfast.  This is a true family owned and operated spot, with the whole family working here.  You will see regulars/family in here hugging and talking to the staff all the time.  It has a real down to earth feel and family owned vibe.  But you want food!  So is the food that good??  Happy to say it is!  We have come here multiple times...tried quite a bit of the menu.  Where they really shine is...you guessed it...the omelets!  We have tried multiple omelets, but my favorites by far are the LOBSTER omelet and the CHORIZO omelet!  The lobster is made with real chunks of lobster, and it is so light and fluffy, it goes down too easy and doesn't hold you down like a heavy meat and bacon omelet.  Super satisfying and awesome flavor though!  The chorizo is the opposite...super heavy and oily like chorizo should be...so much flavor and delicious going on in every bite.  By the way, the servings here are huge...we always order \"baby omelets\" which are 3 instead of 6 eggs, and we still always have leftovers.  Prices are very fair especially considering the quality and serving sizes.  The potatoes are great and everything is fresh!   And the banana and pumpkin bread are crazy good!  In the mornings, they come out piping hot!  If you want a solid breakfast, look no further!"}
{"text":"Cowboy chili and the Mexi-Cali omelette is good. Potato spuds are yummy in my tummy as well as the Banana Nut Bread! Portions are big and satisfying. I would have given 4 stars but Terri, our waitress should brush up on her customer service skills."}
{"text":"Simply has to be the best in Las Vegas for breakfast. Come with an appetite, you will be stuffed and probably leave food on the plate. You also get a choice of pumpkin bread or banana nut bread and they are not small either. Wife says the banana nut bread was awesome. I really recommend that you Verde chili omelette"}
{"text":"This place has good food, a friendly staff and prompt service. Huge portions at a decent price. I would recommend giving it a go. It's clean and comfortable. It's a normal dining experience, somewhat loud and busy. Not chaotic though. Good for families."}
{"text":"This would've been a five star place no doubt \"BUT\" at the beginning of our meal the restaurant allowed a lady to come to our table and offer to make balloon characters for the kids WHICH would normally be ok BUT she didn't ask my husband or I first so of course the kids said yes and we don't carry cash we only had our cards and I told her that BEFORE she started making the balloons but she made them anyways which was nice I thought I guess but then she goes up to the front and complains about just having made balloons for free WTH right! It was very uncomfortable and I thought very unprofessional of the restaurant :( the lady was not clean her bag was filthy and she set it right on our table where we were going to eat yuck.  Ok now for the actual food... It was very good with nice large portions. It came out quickly and all at once. Our waitress was very good and attentive. It was a clean place that would've otherwise been very comfortable. Everyone smiled and was very kind.   After the first initial impression it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The banana Nut bread is worth the trip alone. Everything else is either ok or great depending on what you get and like. I personally hate the spuds and wish they had normal home fries.  Think of this place as a more comfy \"I hop\" with better food for your money. Not super, not bad. Acceptable, reasonable..."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounded up.  My family and I decided to escape from the touristy buffet scenes on the strip and wanted to find where the locals go to get their grub. It was around brunch time and found the Omelet House on my Yelp app, sounds good!  The ambiance had the homey feeling, with the picture frames and figurines on the wall. The chairs were sort of janky, but I didn't care. For the food, they have a large selection of entrees, especially for the omelettes. My parents ordered off the omelette menu and my brother had the $5.99 breakfast special. They also have other breakfast options if you're not an omelette fan like me. I ordered the huevos rancheros.  The food came out and wow, the omelettes my parents ordered were GINORMOUS! How many eggs do they use to make a serving? Looked like half a dozen. It also came along with potatoes that are sliced into coin shapes, such an interesting take on homefries. However, my brother $5.99 breakfast special looked so small, which my parents donated some of their omelette for him. My huevos rancheros was perfectly portioned and loved it. the tortilla chips were a great addition to scoop up the refried beans, salsa and runny egg yolk on the plate. My parents couldn't finish their omelettes even though they gave a portion to my brother.   Overall, great hole-in-a-wall joint. Definitely recommend those who are bulking up on protein or just simply love eggs."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. At par with the other omelette houses in town. The service however, could be much better! I think I saw our waitress maybe 2 or 3 times. Neither me or my girlfriend received any refills. When it came to paying our bill we pretty much could have just walked out. No one seemed to care at all."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Loved the banana or pumpkin bread options instead of toast. Their take on hash browns was good but interesting. If I weren't such a hash brown purist I would've liked it more. Huge portion & great price."}
{"text":"Ridiculously huge omelets, good spuds. 6 egg omelets will keep you full all day long!"}
{"text":"Ok the potatoes chip fries were old and more like stale chips I couldn't eat them. My eggs Benedict lobster was ok but there was a lot more fillers than actual lobster. Like imitation crab meat smh . The flavor of the omelette was nice though."}
{"text":"Off the strip...sooo worth it!!!! 5stars!!!! $$ for cost. Had the Californian and chili cheese omelets, kid had pancakes, everybody shared plates, we all left stuffed! Get the \"baby\" omelets, unless you can eat a 6 egg omelet. Jus' sayin!!!! We shall return!! Oh hell yeah!!!! Julie was Awesome!! Someone comes around with coffee every 5 minutes, so the cup never emptys!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great customer service and the food is excellent!  It is always a must when we come to Vegas....Always!!"}
{"text":"Was out in Vegas for MDW and found this place by a friend's house we were staying at. Place was busy but no wait when we got there. We both couldn't say no to Lobster Benedict! WOW!! I'll be back in Vegas this weekend and we're for sure going to stop back here for some breakfast!"}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast / brunch. Came in today with the family and had a great time. The portions are huge and the prices are really great. Customer service was great: kept our drinks full and not going crazy do you need anything else again and again.  Wasn't too noisy we were able to have a conversation.  I suggest to come and try the place, I will go there again :)"}
{"text":"Classic diner feel, simple and rustic with friendly wait staff. Fairly quick service, went for breakfast/brunch. French toast was very good, melted in your mouth just could have used more of a sear on the outside. Corned beef hash was delicious, very tender. Overall, great food for a good price in a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is \"good old fashioned home cooked\" and very generous portions. I order from the child's menu, as I don't eat a lot, and even the child's plates seem to be an average sized adult portion.  Staff is warm and friendly."}
{"text":"just stopped in for breakfast after playing early morning bingo at the casino, it was pretty quiet, a few patrons.. there is a large selection of omelets on the menu. the portions are pretty big,so we split an omelet.with a 95 cents plate charge((which was ok). Came with tasty fresh pumpkin bread and potato chips??? Yeah deep fried potato like chips for breakfast is a little different,but I prefer hash browns and/or country potatoes.. waitress was friendly and attentive..Unfortunately i am not one to have chili in my omelet and ordered the kitchen sink,which came with it oops,but will go back and try a different omelet.."}
{"text":"We've been to this breakfast restaurant (rounded figure) around 30 times.  Each time the experience has been great - wide selection of breakfast omelets and skillets (they have a lunch menu too!)  Seating has been quick with attentive service.  The menu is vast yet shows they care to make not only delicious omelets but to also make them different than you'd normally get at other breakfast places (yes EggWorks and Blueberry Hill I talking about you).    I personally love the 23. Kitchen Sink - a hodgepodge of any kind of meats, veggies, cheese, and whatever else they have back in the kitchen thrown into a three egg omelet.  Yes, you may need gastrointestinal nursing afterwards.  Others in my company have enjoyed  26. Popeye (spinach, mushrooms, jack cheese), Mom's favorite 27. Lobster Fest (real lobster, avocado, jack cheese), 28. The Sparticus (asparagus, mushrooms, cheddar cheese), and the amazing  Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs (with sauce on the side), plus the Corned Beef and Hash (WITH REAL CORNED BEEF - NOT CANNED).  Yummy!  I have personally enjoyed (besides the Kitchen Sink), 25. Jolly Green Giant (Broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms, tomatoes, cheddar cheese), 13. Green Hornet (avocado or guacamole, tomatoes, cheddar cheese), and 33  1/2. Flatlanders Special (raw liver, parsnips, peanut butter, black jelly beans, grunion lips, gardenia petals topped with mint ice cream).  All have been very tasty!  And, yes 33  1/2. is a joke menu item.  You can't order it.  A part of me wishes I could - just to give it a try.  The last time we were there I ordered a pork chile verde skillet (a first).  There was an option to order it \"Hell's Kitchen\" style which meant it included diced jalapenos and habaneros.  Whereas normally I would add hot sauce to my breakfast, I didn't have to this time.  It was spicy enough.  I only wish they offered the \"Hell's Kitchen\" option on all their dishes and not just the skillets.    I can rave and rave about this place but I have to say we've also had (recently) a bad experience.  9/12/15 to be exact - all of our three orders came out burnt.  Burnt omelets and burnt toast.  We should have sent it back but decided to just scrape off what was edible and drink lots of water.  It was very surprising coming from a place that had up to that moment, been our \"breakfast place.\"  I'm sure we will visit Omelet House again and hope our last visit was just a bad day at the house.    Who doesn't have a bad morning?  See you soon..."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. Seems like a family place. Waitresses and servers recognize the locals.  Food was good and a lot for the price."}
{"text":"Great food and great service from Allison. This place has always been good for a large and hearty meal. I had the eggs with turkey sausage, and a side of oatmeal.   I wish that they would be more attentive to cleanliness and modernizing the dusty decor.  Parking can be difficult during busy times."}
{"text":"This is by far the best option for a Las Vegas hangover. A huge selection of omeletes with combinations I would have never imagined! You can even customize the item you choose with no issue. Omeletes come with potatoes that I was a little sceptical about at first, but they went well and tasted great with the massive omelets. Good price for the portions, and especially after blowing all your money the night before."}
{"text":"Overall decent restaurant portions were huge, no way  you could eat it all in one sitting! The restaurant itself was a little run-down, could definitely use some improvements. Would try it again if I was on that side of town but would not drive out of my way."}
{"text":"My honey and I have been coming here almost every Wednesday or Sunday. This is now our official to go place for some breakfast. The servers here are always happy and hive great service.  The food is delicious and cheap. Their omelets are huge, I can't even finish the baby omelet. Burgers are also huge. A must try is the blueberry stuffed french toast!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and since it was close to downtown where we are spending a few nights, we checked it out.  Let me start out with the really great service.  Constant checking on us and refilling my coffee :)  My hubby ordered an omelet and I ordered the corned beef hash.  Based on other Yelp reviews I ordered my potatoes extra crispy.  They are honestly more like homemade chips than hash browns or fried potatoes.  While not my favorite, they were good.  I got the banana bread instead of toast and it was warm and delicious.  The corned beef hash was made with 90% shredded corned beef and 10% potatoes and was crisped up on both sides...delicious...one of the best I've had.  My hubby enjoyed his omelet but could only eat half since it was freaking huge.  Would definitely go back on our next trip to LV"}
{"text":"Nothing extravigant...im a sucker for eggs benedict...but not when it has powdered hollandaise sauce!!"}
{"text":"Omelet House is my favorite! I love diners and tend to get a variety of foods when I go (weird combinations like pancakes with a side of fries or a burger for breakfast lol) and they never disappoint. The chocolate chip pancakes are my favorite"}
{"text":"Love their simple flap jack can't go wrong with that tasty pancake"}
{"text":"Last time here was extremely long line!! But still good place. Parking seems plentiful, though it is shared with the other nearby businesses. Prices are also fair."}
{"text":"This was an incredible breakfast. I had the #27 Lobster and avocado omelette with a waffle. The food was of such hearty portions that I shared it with a friend. The prices are more than reasonable for the amount of food you get. The staff was extremely knowledgeable, professional and fast. Whenever I visit again I'm coming here. Oh and I can't forget the light and spongy banana nut bread. Fantastic. Nom nom"}
{"text":"This place is great. You have to be in Vegas with a car however as it is not exactly close to a lot of other things (but it is a very short drive from the Strip, etc.) The food was excellent - the selection of omelets was amazing. The Plymouth Rock - (turkey, guac, cheese, some veggies) was great. There is an option for a slightly smaller omelet for 89 cents less. Unless you are a huge eater you probably are going to want to go for the smaller one - because you get Pumpkin or Banana Nut bread with the omelet!"}
{"text":"If you're tired of waiting in line at all the big hotels and want to eat brunch off the strip, this is where you should go.  All the plates we ordered we're filling and large.  Some noteworthy items on the menu: Chicken fried steak, pumpkin and banana bread, and the corned beef hash!"}
{"text":"Awesome diner! Loved it.   The good:  Omelet rocked! Especially the #38 (sausage, bacon, ham,  jack cheese, cheddar cheese).. heart attack on a plate!  Chips were \"weird\" for bfast, but yummy Pumpkin bread... warm and DELISH Service was off the hook. Our waitress was cheerful, funny, and sweet. She was fast and attentive and had a personality to boot. Some of the best service I've had in the Vegas area.   The bad: Orange juice was eh... OPH has much better. Pancakes weren't good. Weird texture, not good taste.. stick to the pumpkin bread people !  Overall a great dining experience.. I'll be back, but Original Pancake House is still my #1."}
{"text":"Good food. Good people. Good choice. Have a very difficult old-fashioned mother who hates everything. She loved this place, which means I now love this place."}
{"text":"This place is great! The service was awesome, the staff was very friendly and the prices affordable. Will definitely come back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is insane on the weekends, but even if there's a wait - it's short. There's plenty of room, in fact you'll probably have to walk at least three-minutes to arrive at your table if you're seated in the back like we were. I dislike how noisy and crowed it can be, but I suppose that's expected. Our server was quick, gave us the attention we needed during our meal, no rush, got the order right, no issues.   The food was good - fatty - guaranteed to help you pack on at least 5 pounds. But the omelette were HUGE and of course there's other typical breakfast stuff, pancakes, waffles, bread muffins. The coffee was not very good but at least it was warm.   I could probably come back for something lighter. I was really impressed at how easy it was to come in, get seated, order, eat, and get our check and no issues."}
{"text":"Oh gosh this place is tucked back in a corner of a shopping center but well worth finding. The young man who greeted us was a little rude scolding us for not waiting to seated however the \"sign\" telling us why to do was not out so we sat ourselves. Anyway.....so worth it, the waitress Valerie was so attentive, she was  training new waitress so she was trying to please us and her trainee, she did marvellous. I had a cheese omelette, my husband had polish sausage omelette...the potatoes that come with breakfast are hardto describe but so very yummy. Their banana bread is so good we ordered some to go. This place is the real deal breakfast! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge!  Food is soooooo yummy! The chile verde is soooooo yummy and the spuds are sooooo yummy! Everything that I have ever tried has been yummy. But they do all the dollar to change this, dollar to add that, and not say anything about it.  That bugs me, if you are going to charge extra for something give me a heads up. Other than that the service and food are great!"}
{"text":"I'm literally always looking for good breakfast places, and this one happens to be right by my house. Everything I've had there has been average but enough to keep me satisfied. The ONLY thing that I dislike about this place is their hash brown potato buds which are more like potato chips. It's the only thing that makes me choose somewhere else, every time! If they could even offer hash browns on the menu I'd be coming back!"}
{"text":"Im in Las Vegas for a few days and my husband and I decided to go somewhere for Breakfast.  Found this place near downtown. I had the corn beef hash which was quite good but the potatoes that came with it, were like having Home made potato chips, which is not exactly what I was looking to have for breakfast.  The place was very nice, very clean a little hard to find, if you missed the sign, you would miss it.  Not sure if we are in town again that we would go back."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service. Old school restaurant .Wife and I ordered a omelet. Big servings. Probably  could of shared a plate. Food and coffee were good :)"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Omelet House is way over priced. Many other restaurants in the area reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I do not understand the high rating for this place.  It wasn't terrible, but it was not good.  A four or five star rating should indicate an outstanding experience.  I'd say it's worthy of a rating between one and one-and-a-half stars, nothing more. Coffee was so-so, but I'm not rating the coffee... Wife took a bite of her \"potatoes\" (basically homemade potato chips...  Breakfast is SO much better than potato chips, homemade or not) and warned me they were extremely salty. They were, but I enjoyed them for a few bites, then I was over them.  I love a good chorizo, so I ordered the chorizo omelette with flour tortillas.  Maybe the cook was being heavy-handed with the salt today, maybe it's always this way, I don't know, but all I can say is that we will not return.  Chorizo is salty anyway, but this was terribly salty.  And the tortillas?  I'd swear they were purchased from a supermarket, taken out of the wrapper, put on a plate and microwaved. My wife ordered sausage and eggs.  She felt the sausage was from the freezer aisle from the same supermarket. I am far from a food snob and love a good dive/greasy-spoon restaurant every once in a while, but I feel like Yelp let me down on this one.  A cheap Vegas buffet would have been more satisfying today."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to grab Sunday breakfast from, but today marked the end of my love.  I never knew ordering a simple omlet from their menu would be so difficult.   First,  the cashier had no idea what was provided on the menu then we were moved to the server where the server had no idea what the restaurant offered on the menu.  It is safe to say that this location as incompetent workers and lack of knowledge of menu items into they are able to know them in you or at least review the menu I don't believe I will be free quitting this facility any longer."}
{"text":"This place is our go-to breakfast place.  My wife and daughter love the pumpkin bread which is one of their bread choices to go with breakfast.  Personally I'm a huge fan of their Chicken Philly Sandwich.  Their \"Spuds\" (basicly fresh seasoned potato chips) are killer.  The only time we have had much of a wait is when we have family in and are coming as a large group, coming in a group of 4 or less you can get in and seated in a matter of a few minutes usually."}
{"text":"With all the great reviews . . . this place was on my definitely stopping list . . . boy what a disappointment.  First . . . the d√©cor was older, quaint, and Midwestern . . . but the dust on some of the things looked like it had been there a while . . . definitely in need of a good dusting.  Second . . . the food was luke warm, tasteless, and very disappointing.  Order the biscuits and gravy with a side of extra biscuits . . . while the first biscuit was great, the side biscuits looked, tasted, and the texture of dinner rolls.  And though I new the potatoes were home chips . . . they tasted stale and were not crunchy.  All thing considered . . . not one of my better breakfast choices . . . not sure if I will ever be back."}
{"text":"This place looks like it's a million years old, but the service and food are awesome.    Had the eggs benedict, the they throw on some kind of seasoning that's like paprika and parsley over everything.  Tasted real yum.  Their potatoes are off the hook.  Banana nut bread is really good, pumpkin is ok.  Waffle is nice and large, too.  There is a lobster version of eggs benedict which is supposed to be the bomb but I have a seafood allergy so no thanks.  Be careful of how much you order - don't order 3-4 things like I do even if they sound/look good.  Great for a bunch of hungry guys.  Not far from strip.  Travelers will feel welcome.  Big parking lot."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Vegas!  Not on the Strip and an old southwestern looking style restaurant but such an awesome awesome breakfast.   I had the Lobster Benedict.  What a deal.  Cost me $12 and the portion size was incredible.   Lots of eggs, lots of lobster.  I was in heaven.   Waitress kept refilling my coffee and was kind , polite and friendly.    6 stars if if I give it, but Yelp only allows 5."}
{"text":"YUM! Their omelets are huge (6 eggs). You can get a baby omelet which is half the size, but it's only $1 cheaper so definitely not worth it. I would suggest just sharing the regular sized omelet. (They charge $0.95 splitting fee which is definitely not bad.)  Omelets come with homemade chips (YUM) and choice of bread. Choose the pumpkin bread!! So good!  Omelets are about $10-$12... But are HUGE and shareable.   KITCHEN SINK: omelet with basically everything besides the premium items (seafood, avocado, etc). This was really really good!!! And even included chilli which made everything better. GET THIS.   LOBSTER FEST: omelet with lobster, cheese, and avocado. The lobster was really good and they are definitely generous with the lobster. However, I wouldn't order this again. Lobster is a pretty bland flavor in general, so is egg.... Making the omelet uninteresting. The individual components of this omelet were good, but all together, it didn't fit well.   JACK OF ALL TRADES: burger with guac, lettuce, tomatoes (also comes with homemade chips but no bread). Surprisingly really good as well!!!! I liked this better than my lobster omelet. $10"}
{"text":"GIGANTIC portions of breakfast treats and potatoes, now that's what I'm talking about!  Just 10 minutes away from the main strip, the Omelet House is definitely a place to get your money's worth. I ordered the Shrimp omelet that was about half the size of my head, and to top it off, it came with a side of spuds and toast.   Saving your appetite for the buffets? No, save your appetite for the Omelet House, A must-try breakfast place!"}
{"text":"1st note..... prices are reasonable for breakfast, you get large portions and it's tasty.  The muffin/ bread they have that comes with the omelet is bomb. My husband had the pumpkin nut bread. It was hot, moist and it comes with butter.... so yum.  His omelet also came with fresh cut potato chips.... loved these. I had the waffle with bacon. Waffle had an almond extract flavor to it. Different but good. Bacon was thin and greasy so I didn't care too much for that. They have a long list of Omelets with yummy interesting combinations, they are stuffed and they are huge. You can also fill with whatever you desire if you don't decided on the menu items. We'll be back as soon as we return to Las Vegas. It's worth the trip away from the strip."}
{"text":"15% off with my hotel stay right across the street, so we thought, why not? Plus, the reviews are really good...  It's not like it's terrible. But it just isn't ANYTHING special at all. It's not up to par with the sort of brunch places I'm used to going to, it's more like Dennys or IHOP quality.   I got a skillet. $10.95 plus $1 for the \"hell's kitchen\" (jalapeno and habanero added) and while I appreciate the option for heat, it WAS overwhelming for me. I got the spicy chicken, which was very medicore chicken that wasn't spicy at all. It was supposed to come with a ranchero sauce, but I saw none on there to speak of. Basically, it was chicken, potatoes, cheese, the peppers, onions and green some green pepper and an egg over medium plopped on top. I put the egg to the side; I'm not really an egg person, they are too boring! It was aight.   I was served a big fat slice of banana bread for some reason and it was completely flavorless. Gross.   I wouldn't come here again, just not good enough to be worth it."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the portions are very large, the coffee is the best I have ever had  (sorry SB). And the service is great.  Everyone including the patrons are very very nice."}
{"text":"I'm from California and I don't really know that many places that are like this over there. To be honest I was going to go to eggslut but I had a what evers impression of the one in California and there was a long wait. In my opinion, I think eggslut is over rated and not worth the wait. I don't want to spend my time waiting in line for an hour for something I'm not too excited over when I can go to someplace new and possibly more yummy. I'm glad I tried this place because it's delicious! I'm usually not a fan of omelets cause a lot of places make it really dry. But not this place. This place made it deliciously juicy and they even have their own chips which was also super yummy. Their service is amazing and they pay attention to their customers. Also I got seated almost immediately after walking in. I'm glad I came here over eggslut. It saved so much of my time and it's super filling. I even had left overs when I left. If I had gone to eggslut, the amount of money I would have wasted on a meal here wouldn't have even gotten me full. I would definitely recommend this place and would come back when ever I'm in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"the line will move fast...so don't worry if u see one...ok the eggs are good but what take me here is the .warm banana bread ..and the potato  (spuds ) its a must its more like breakfast chips....when u find yourself in Las Vegas try this place ..your be back again and again."}
{"text":"Lobster Benny is a must try! Soooooooo fresh and good! Their portion is also huge! Omelette is also very fresh and tasty! Everything is fast, service is good! Will definitely drop by again for breakfast during my Vegas visit."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to spots in Vegas when I want a solid breakfast.  Off the strip and I like hanging with the locals.  You must try this place when in Las Vegas.  Big portions I recommend sharing, enjoy"}
{"text":"Rating is zero stars for the customer experience that I was given to me by the employees and even owner of the omelet house. I unfortunately had to experience hair in my food and when I brought it to the attention of the employees there was no apology or accountability. Then the owner came over and proceeded to tell me that \" I enjoy the hell out of my meal and blamed me for having hair in my food\" I was at this point insulted and made to feel as though my meal of $10.00 was more important than the overall customer experience. I will never eat there again. Needless to say this was the worst customer experience I have ever experience and after you read this you rethink if you time is worth being mistreaded by an owner who doesn't value his customers experience."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Our waiter Geo was awesome.  Those potato \"chips\" were unbelievable."}
{"text":"This is my favorite non-chain breakfast spot and that's saying a lot because I would normally pick sleep over waking up for breakfast. It would take a lot for me to sacrifice an extra few hours of snoozing - this place is THAT special. I actually look forward to eating here...well, once every few months.  They have eggs benedict and a variety of omelets hence the name \"Omelet House\". Don't bother getting toast, make the right decision and pick the banana bread. It's delicious, warm, buttery and it's huge. It's like having dessert for breakfast - what a treat! My favorites are country club/ sparticus/ 38 special...in baby version which is still quite big (3 eggs). Your omelet will come with a side of potatoes. They're like thick freshly-made potato chips and oh-so good! You're off to a great morning and nothing can ruin your day.  Aside from omelets, they also have pancakes, waffles, sandwiches and burgers - I haven't tried them. With omelets served here, I don't need to try anything else. But I would imagine they're good too."}
{"text":"THE breakfast of Vegas champions, or at least when you feel like a champion the next morning.  (Is it really morning already?) These omelets are so huge, they have their own zip code.    Choosing one of 20+ omelet varieties is probably the best bet, since they could feed a family of four. Side of home fries or chips, big cup of unlimited coffee, and you are a champion."}
{"text":"All good plenty of space inside if parking lot looks full they have open tables inside"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast to end our Vegas weekend. Really good pancakes and spuds. The service was a little slow but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for breakfast at about 9 a.m. on a Saturday morning.  Was very busy, but we were seated fairly quickly.  Service is very efficient - the servers have busers and runners to keep coffee cups full (very good coffee!).  Our server was very friendly and helpful as well.  I got the cowboy special - a chili cheese omelet, which came with potatoes and (I chose) a side of pumpkin bread.  The pumpkin bread came out quickly, and was, warm, moist and delicious, especially with the coffee.  Omelet arrived before I finished my pumpkin bread - kitchen definitely runs like clockwork here.  The omelet was HUGE and good, but a little heavy on the (raw) onions for my taste.  Nice chili.  The eggs were a little firmer then I like, but that's just me (my perfect omelet is Peppermill).  Was still tasty though.  The potatoes on the side were really good - like a combination of a potato chip and a french fry.  I ended up taking them home and having them that night for dinner - they were great even cold and refrigerated.  We finished up, got the bill (arrived very promptly at the end of the meal), and vacated the table for the next party - we realized when we left (about 9:45) that the line was not only out the door, but was starting to wrap around the building.  Definitely would like to come back and try some of their other items.  Food is good, very nice service, just get there early if you're going for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great service, yummy food for a great price! This is a family fav for sure. There's something for everyone our kiddos love it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better omelette houses in Vegas. With that said. It's one of the busiest omelette houses in Vegas. Expect long wait lines.  Some of your servers have been around with omelette house a long time. The give it the down home country, hey how are u vibe.   What can I say I love this place. One of these days I'll take on the 12 egg omelette or the 3lb burger. Until then give this place a try.  Note: if u don't like waiting this us not the place for you. Call ahead and check their wait times."}
{"text":"This place may have an unappealing 1970s country diner vibe, but the high food quality, huge portions, low prices, and excellent service will definitely win you over. I live on the other side of the valley on the west side of I-15 but this breakfast spot is always worth the trip.  The number of omelet options is staggering and I can't stress enough how massive the servings are (the standard omelet has six eggs). The breakfast potatoes are also the best in town -- although they're more like thick potato chips than traditional hash browns -- and the pumpkin bread and banana bread will \"blow you away.\"  You can't go wrong with most of the items, but my favorite omelets are the Chili Verde (pork, green chile sauce and jack cheese), the 38 Special (ham, bacon and sausage with jack and cheddar cheese) and the Country Club (turkey, bacon, tomatoes and cheddar cheese). The homemade corned beef hash is also amazing and may just be the best I've ever had.  This restaurant even has a famous food challenge (the Flatlander's Special) that makes people's eyes bulge out when they see it on the menu. It has to be a joke, because it's probably the most disgusting thing I've ever heard of...   If you're man enough or woman enough to order it, the Flatlander's Special consists of raw liver, parsnips, peanut butter, organically grown black jelly beans, sauteed grunion lips (2), and gardenia petals and then topped with mint ice cream. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After eating her the second time, I had to write a review! I found out about this place, after my friend told me all the locals go here not far from the strip. I admit the place looked questionable from the outside, you'd never know it was a great restaurant. And when you enter, your taken back by all the novelties decorated on the walls, but I must stay the food and service is great. I had the country fried steak and eggs, and it was the best Ive ever had. The second time I went with my boyfriend and we had the pleasure of the owner actually serving us. He and his staff always showed some of the best service we ever received. Next time you visit Las Vegas, save your money from one of those high priced  hotel buffets and go here. You wont be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast joint. Anytime I go out for breakfast, I go here. My roommate and I split a veggie omelet as they give a lot of food. You can split any omelet and get extra potatoes for an extra dollar. I've liked everything I have had here. There are so many options so any palate can find something they'll love.   Friendly staff and always quick service."}
{"text":"I love there potatoe spuds and they make great omlets love there muffins. You should definitely go there for breakfast it's very relaxing and comfortable."}
{"text":"With all of the more modern breakfast places around (Cracked Egg, Eggworks, etc.) it was nice to visit one that had a more traditional feel. Reminds me of the places back home I went to since I was a little girl. The decor is aged but charming with antiques and older knick knacks around the restaurant. The menu is great and I love the choice between pumpkin or banana bread with breakfast. And the spuds were so good! The prices are reasonable, the service was decent, and the food was delicious! I'll be heading back here for a reliably good breakfast."}
{"text":"Delicious! There was a long line when we first arrived but everyone was seated within 10 minutes. Immediately after being seated we were greeted by three people making sure we had our drink order in. The food was amazing! I had Blueberry stuffed french toast with eggs and the most perfect bacon I've ever had. The ONLY downside (and this is simply a preference and not an actual con) is the spuds. I love me some hashbrowns or country potatoes but they serve more like a roasted potato almost like a chip but softer? It was good, just not what I preferred. My husband ordered an omelet and it was just as delicious! Wonderful experience! Definitely going back next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Holy cow...this place rocks! Take a trip off the strip and check this out if you're in town! I got the King's Heart (I think that's what it was called) with mushrooms, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, and jack cheese. SO good and huge portions. It came with a side of a bread you can choose. We chose banana bread and omg...warm and delicious. Great service also! The inside is pretty kitschy, but this is off the beaten path and where locals go. Love it!"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of coming in here on a whim. I saw some good reviews on here and thought I would enjoy it. I was wrong. This place is entirely too crowded and loud to expect actually enjoying a meal. I ordered an omelet and hashbrowns. I directly stated HASHBROWNS, but they brought me....potato chips... and they were covered in the most disgusting moldy herb mixture that unfortunately, it seems the kitchen covers everything with, it was dumped all over my omelet as well. The one, and I mean ONE saving grace of this place was the side of bread. I got the pumpkin bread and another of my party got the banana nut bread. Both were amazingly moist and flavorful. I would highly recommend here only to get a piece of bread to-go. I had one final awful experience, the waitress dropped off our check and disappeared, it took flagging down a table busser to grab my payment for it, even a man who I assume was the manager walked around personally seating people, but was equally as useless after departing. I personally will never return, the bread wasn't worth the rude awakening."}
{"text":"I think our waitress was Valerie. She was fantastic.  Our beverages were always filled quickly.  The lobster eggs benedict was divine!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant!  We visit the Omelet House every few weeks.  The staff are always friendly and the food is always fantastic.  The Stuffed French Toast and Lobster with Avacado omelet are superb."}
{"text":"Great food!! Great service!! Great atmosphere!!! Don't let the shabby exterior fool you!! Inside is AWESOME!!! Thank you for a Wonderful meal!!  ***Thanks to the \"local\" that directed us here!!"}
{"text":"Ew. First they have the worst coffee I have ever been served in any restaurant ever. I'm 62. I lived in America before Starbucks and this is still the worst. It tastes weak and burnt at the same time. Quite an achievement. No excuses for a hash house charging all the money. I ordered the corned beef hash with poached eggs. I did not receive poached eggs. I got something called \"steam basted\" eggs. They looked like fried eggs without the frying. Unappetizing. Finally I'm not sure what they are thinking with their potatoes. They are potato chips cut just a hair too thick to cook up crispy so most arrive just full of oil, soggy and stuck together. The single worst potato dish I have ever been served in a restaurant. That's 'two worst ever served' for this joint. English Muffin was the cheapest store brand variety. This place was extremely busy. And the reviews here are mostly positive but from my perspective it is in desperate need of an intervention."}
{"text":"Today, I got hot dogs instead of polish sausage in my omelette. The spuds were good though. Next time, I'll try a burger instead."}
{"text":"Henderson's little hole in the wall. If you're looking for a great breakfast spot, you need to hit up the Omelet House! Their portions are huge and the price is cheap and affordable! You can tell everything is made fresh and everyone is always so friendly. I love the vibe and the decor! They close at 3pm everyday so if you want to go, try to go early. It tends to get pretty packed on the weekends but they seat you fairly quickly.   Their Corn beef Hash is the way to go! I've never had anything like it! It'll make you say Hash-House-A-Go-Who?    The Omelet House - a MUST try if you're ever in the Hendertucky area!"}
{"text":"I came here a few times when I lived in Vegas. It's a very cute mom and pop looking place.  If there is a wait it's usually only a few minutes.  The only thing that's disappointing is that they serve these potato spuds that look like potato chips instead of hash browns or breakfast potatoes.  I find that strange in a place thts  known as a breakfast joint."}
{"text":"What a find! Hidden away off of Charleston, this is a homey, wonderful place. Great breakfast menu, nice staff and great food! A welcome relief from the casino restaurants."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot in downtown vegas! Their corned beef is AWESOME and so is their banana bread.  I always want to try one of the omelets but i can't pass up corned beef so my review is based solely on the corned beef and banana bread.  Just thinking about it is making me hungry!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. It's one if my favorite breakfast places in the valley. The service is always quick and friendly, and I love that it's a family owned business. I always love supporting that. The only thing is the omelttes are HUGE! I'm talking massive. My fianc√© and I have to split one, and even then were STUFFED! But it's good because you get a lot for your money... So that's a plus"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!! Amazing homemade food.Servers are beyond friendly and attentive. Portions are also great for anyone who likes to eat.. Met and exceeded expectations! Wish they had one of these in California. A definite place to go!"}
{"text":"Local spot with amazing service. The food was tasty and portions were huge. More importantly, the coffee, definitely not your typical weak, watery, American coffee (no offense). This was strong, tasty and bottomless!!! We will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Nasty, canned food. This place gives large portions of flavorless mushy food. Everything is heaped with homemade potato chips that have no taste. Im guessing the 4 star rating is for the portion size. Yuck!!! Glad I didnt waste the calories and didnt eat it, a couple bites and thats it. 33 bucks down the drain."}
{"text":"I ate here for breakfast over the holiday weekend with some friends. They, of course, ordered Omelettes (I mean, who goes to an Omelette house and orders anything else?!) and then me being the weirdo that I am, I got a chicken sandwich. We were all thoroughly satisfied with our meals, the portions given and the pricing. The only complaint I have is the overly attentive staff that visited our table at least eight times during the course of a forty-five minute meal (which, if that is the worst thing to say about a food joint, you know they are darn good at what they do). I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed...the potatoes were dry and rubbery...the corned beef hash was tasteless, a bit dry and had those same rubbery potatoes..the pumpkin bread was very good.. the prices are rather high"}
{"text":"It's been one week since I walked in your doors.   I miss you so much eggs Benedict Florentine. So, so much."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars because the food is great,  It's clean, kitschy and very generous for the price.  Expect to take food home unless you are feeding a teenage boy. Server we had was not a perky high energy person but since we came in an hour prior to closing, she was fine. Our omelets were hot, fluffy and exactly as ordered,  which isn't easy since the Hubby must order HIS way!!!LOL We enjoy bringing out of towners here because of the consistent quality in food & service."}
{"text":"I have NOT eaten here, yet! I work in LLV @ Sunset & Vines and a \"local couple\" mentioned that it is the BEST breakfast around! Planning to try this weekend! Sounds like they will NOT disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great diner to stop in and enjoy hefty portions of breakfast food while you're chilling in Henderson, NV.  We stopped in on a busy Sunday morning and only had to wait for about 15 min before we were seated. They're pretty fast and efficient here, and I'm talking about the local customers not just the servers. :P  -Eggs are cooked well. -House potatoes were BOMB diggity! I totally thought I was going to pass on these but they're like thinly sliced potatoes sauted lightly with some salt and pepper. I ate them like chips!  -Pumpkin bread was moist and delicious as well.  Definitely a diner we will return to if we're ever in this area again.   Side note: If you're sort of a \"health freak\" but you do enjoy diner food, bring your own packets of Stevia to sweeten your coffee. They only carry the \"bad sh*t\" here (Sweet'N Low or)."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 10 years. My aunt had found it on one of her visits to us and said we would try it. Thank goodness we are breakfast ppl! There are 39 omelettes alone! Not to mention regular breakfast offerings such as fluffy waffles with a hint of almond flavor. They also offer lunch, burgers, sandwiches and soup. The Fried Zucchini is amazing, light batter around thick cut spears of squash. I ordered the Lobster Fest omelette, baby sized for .89 cents less, its 3/4 the size of the reg omelette avail on any omelette, this was stuffed with chunks of sweet luscious lobster and slices of buttery avocado. Accompanied by homestyle spuds and choice of warm pumpkin nut bread, toast, or when available, banana bread. I always say I'm going to try lunch, but inevitably end up with a scrumptious omelette."}
{"text":"This place is pretty big and has a old school country appeal to it. Their menu has omelettes every which way you can possibly think of and much more. They have what ever your taste buds desire. Make sure you have a large appetite because their portions are HUGE. I really enjoyed this place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast on the weekends! The service and food are always top notch. This family owned and run restaurant always feels like home as soon as you walk in the door. You are greeted and seated by the husband, wife is in the kitchen cooking, and son is cashing you out at the end of the meal. Wait staff is always pleasant and smiling. Here is a place that gives you an all around great dining experience."}
{"text":"Our families favorite breakfast place. Customer service is always great and the food is even better. Huge portion sizes, as we always end up bringing half of our meal home. Restaurant is always clean,  food is always hot and consistent. Their pumpkin bread is the best I have ever had. The potato's they serve with meals are freshly cut, fried and so good! I usually get the ham omelette. Never disappointed. Fluffy eggs, generous amounts of ham and cheese. Served with the potatoes and pumpkin bread. So good!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Vegas, hands down. I would not trade this place for any spot on the strip. They serve most of the breakfast plates with some amazing potatoes. Do not let the pictures of potatoes deceive you. The potatoes are soft, tasty and are better than hash browns. This is what a real American breakfast tastes like. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was good. Banana nut bread was awesome, omelette I was not so crazy about. Over all I was not dissatisfied but I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"My parents insist on eating here every time they come to town. Not that I mind of course. The bugsy omelet has suckered me into trying to gorge myself on several occasions. It has Italian roast beef in it...and is scrumptious! My Mom loves the Popeye omelet, which has a lot of spinach in it. The home fries are really good too! I sometimes visit the other location on west Buffalo because it's closer. I heard they opened one in the new Alliante casino, I'll have to try that as well."}
{"text":"I've been to the Omelet House many times. Each and every time, I have been exceptionally pleased with the service and the food. The staff is amazingly friendly. They will do their best to serve your needs and they also seem to be enjoying their work.  The portion sizes are huge and present quality selections on both their breakfast and lunch menu. Concerning breakfast, I have many different skillets and always leave satisfied. In addition, their banana nut bread melts into your taste buds. Concerning their lunch menu, I have tried many of their burgers and sandwiches and find them all delectable. I especially enjoy the Chicken Mushroom Sandwich.  In terms of atmosphere, the decor is playful and there is plenty of open space. Unlike a chain like IHOP, even when they are busy, you don't feel as though your neighbors are sitting right next to you. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to locals and tourists passing through."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here. The food portions were huge, the potatoes delicious, and most of all the service was great! Everyone was very friendly and quickly refilled our drinks. You may have a bit of a wait, but it is well worth it. I am definitely returning next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"The client I worked for today took us here for lunch..... I asked \"Are they still serving breakfast?\" He said, \"All day, Everyday!\".....Sweeet! I could eat breakfast for every meal if I could.  I had the #13 Omelet. The F'in thing must of had 6 eggs in it! Huge! I ordered the banana bread for toast. I expected cold sliced like at home....Nope! A 2 inch tall square like a brownie. It was awesome! I could barely finish half the omelet..... and i ate very few fries.  My only dislike was their style of fries/ hash browns. They're pretty much homemade potato chips. They were OK, but I don't like potatoes cooked like that.   And I was on a business trip.... No Amex. Did I say try the banana bread?!?"}
{"text":"Order the spuds with breakfast and sandwiches they are awesome.  Come hungry because everytime i come here..always leftovers"}
{"text":"I love it here I try to go every week if I'm not working. I am firm believer that it does not matter how impressive your menu is what the quality of your food and if you do not have awesome servers that always have a smile on their face people won't come back and they will not recommend their friends I have been to restaurants where the food was delicious but the staff left a bad taste in my mouth and that is where I go to this place because the staff are awesome I always sit in the same section my servers name is Jose I always get the same quality service from him and if his section is full I would wait even if every other table in the restaurant was empty He is very knowledgeable on the menu and  recommends good things to eat. Their menu is great I am Big omelette person so I usually order from the lunch menu. But my dining companion that I usually go with has tried pretty much all of them and loves them. the omelettes are large enough that he cannot usually finish them.   So what I recommend going here to eat I most definitely would and if you decide to stop and ask for Jose as your server because he is A very good server"}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a Sunday around noon with three others for my boyfriend's birthday breakfast! The plaza is quite old looking and the Omelet House is a bit hidden. When you go in, you'll see several figurines and trinkets on the wall, like in your grandma's house, as my boyfriend had put it. The hostess seated us right away and led us to our table in the back area to the right past the restrooms. I was surprised on how huge the restaurant was!  When we got seated, the hostess handed us menus that were huge also! It took me awhile to decide, but I knew I was getting banana bread as my friends had highly recommended. I ended up getting the Country Club with no tomatoes. And wow, it was delicious!! They are very generous in the content of the omelette and loved how cheesy it was. The chips it came with were so good too!! Also really big portion, so I didn't finish mine. Probably next time, I'll do the smaller portion or share with someone.  Food - 2/2 Atmosphere - 1/1 Customer service - 1/1 Price - 1/1 My Overall - 5/5"}
{"text":"I've tried giving this place a shot a few times and every time I am disappointed. I've had their sausage and avocado omelette, huevos rancheros, French toast, zucchini, and biscuits and gravy. The omelette didn't have any flavor, avocados were not ripe. Huevos rancheros were severed over a tortilla instead of a tostada and once again lacking flavor. French toast and the biscuits and gravy were good but not great enough for me to order them again. Zucchini was yummy but the cheese sauce and ranch weren't too great, which how can you go wrong with cheese sauce and ranch? Anyways this place is right by my house and I really wish they had good food for the amount of stars they have."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. The first time for eggs and the second time we chose the country fried steak and let me just say WOW, YUMMY, DELICIOUS...and it came with their famous warm banana nut bread. The homemade potato chips are the bomb as well. The chicken fried steak was very generous in its portion and the gravy was perfect. We are going again tomorrow as a matter of fact. Love this place and the service is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Not so good. Chicken fried steak was greasy, homemade potato chips seemed old. On the upside banana nut bread was good. Drinks are way overpriced as well. I recently ate at the Charleston location which was EXCELLENT,  I can see that each location is so different,  to bad. We won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Breakfast today, it's Omelet house and I got a favorite of mine, the cheese, bacon, and mushroom. We got fast service and the food came nice and hot, but my omelet which had cheddar cheese in it, had way too much cheese and someone had added chicken?   Since I was very specific about bacon, I was surprised to see the chicken. I think that perhaps my order was mixed up with someone Else's, or the server didn't hear me correctly.   It wasn't that bad, but it was a disappointment that I didn't get my bacon. Since my husband and I often watch our carbs, (we try to go pretty strict) we both got sliced tomato's instead of potatoes. I think they have pretty good potatoes and of course the pumpkin bread, which we did pass on this time, is always good.   This place is good for breakfast and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Let me start my review by saying the reason why I gave it four stars is because it's kind of in the ghetto but once you get in there you feel like you walked into your grandma's house and it makes all that ghetto-Ness go away LOL.  OK now down to the nitty-gritty of the review. First off let me say that we had a large party and they quickly accommodated all of us we waited about 10 minutes to get seated. Our servers were always coming to our tables asking us if we needed anything, not to mention they had a packed out house. Inside disestablishment is like a blast to the past I took so many pictures of little Nick Nack's and pictures that were hanging on the wall because they were things that I had seen in my moms house or my grandmas house. I really enjoy the ambience of this restaurant very homey feeling and the food was really good. I ordered the Chile Verde omelette and I must say it was delicious, if you're not a big eater this is probably something you could split with another adult I only ate half of mine and I was stuffed. With every plate they give you a side of homemade potato chips let me just say bomb! When they ask you if you want toast English muffin pumpkin or banana nut bread make sure you get the Punkin bread it was to die for and it was a huge serving once again I split it with one of the kids.   I will definitely be visiting this establishment when we return to Vegas on next year's family vacation."}
{"text":"When they deliver your omelet to your table it is so big you don't think you will be able to eat it all. But it is soooooo good you will. Great selections of many different omelet styles or order other food items. Prices are good and service is great"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.   Stuffed french toast with cream cheese and blueberries sausage and eggs- SOO GOOD! HUGE proportions.  Chorizo omelet with pumpkin bread and potatoes- HUGE AND VERY TASTY!  Health Nut Vegetarian omelet with mushrooms zuchini pepper jack cheese - pretty good too.  Overall BIG proportions. One order contains approx 3 seevings if you're not a pig. Not too salty like other breakfast joints."}
{"text":"OMG!!! I have found my new guilty pleasure! The pumpkin bread was excellent! And, my 38 Special omelet, I just finished eating it at 1130pm!!! The meat was very tender and you did not have to put any extra seasonings!!! The potato chip fries were awesome, but never got to eat them!!! The hot cocoa was excellent...OMG! I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Me and Mama came for lunch today and normally, I order an omelet. Well, ordered the pastrami burger and bought fell out of my chair!  O-M-G!!! I have not had sucha good burger in sucha long time!!!  They cure their own meat and our waitress said they even cure their own corned beef...heart be still!!! Well, as we were leaving, this lady came in and said that we must try the fish and chips; they are cooked to perfection! not bulky and have a crunch! oh, next time...next time..."}
{"text":"First time visiting Vegas and stumbled upon the omelet house. Wow best corn beef hash I've ever had the omelets are HUGE. We LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast joint. Shannon my server was very friendly and made sure my coffee and water were topped off. The portion size was insane. I am 300 lbs and I'm super full. I'd recommend if you're not fat to get the smaller size omelet lol.  The spuds, FYI, are homemade potato chips that are just a little bit thicker than usual. Really good, but they aren't good for you by any stretch. Kind of wish they had breakfast potatoes tbh.  Very good bacon, very pleased with this place."}
{"text":"OMG simply amazing! One of my new fave breakfast spots! Portions are HUGE so come hungry for sure. The warm banana bread that comes with your meal is a meal in it's self! Lots of options, sauces, sides, egg beaters, whites etc. You can even order the kitchen sink - literally! It's nothing fancy but very homey and cozy like you are at your grandparents house for Sunday brunch! Staff is extremely friendly and sweet. They even called Stan (one of the waitresses husband who is a cab driver) and he was just awesome! It's about a $15-20 cab ride to/from the strip but soooooo worth it! All around a must do for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We didn't eat here. Walked in, saw the old decor, furniture, clientele, then turned around and found somewhere else. Crazy how the place is highly rated on Yelp. After many years in food service, I can actually smell if a restaurant is going to be good, when I walk into the place. Omelet House might not be good for me and my family, but that doesn't mean it may not be acceptable for others. It's like buying fresh produce at a Farmer's Market, versus WalMart.. just depends on your own taste."}
{"text":"I come to this location and the Henderson location a couple of times a month. They're both great. The food is exceptional, portions are large and a great value for money, the service is excellent.   My waitress was Megan, and she did a fantastic job of keeping the coffee full and making sure our service was prompt and accurate.   This place is great for business lunches because they get you in and out very quickly. I don't have any criticisms of this place - solid.   Definitely check out the Omelet House."}
{"text":"This is a locals breakfast joint.  It's been around forever, and hasn't be redecorated since the mid-70's.   The servers are mostly older, and have probably been working there since the place opened.  The decor and the service is 'Meh'.  This isn't a Strip restaurant.  It's a small hole-in-the-wall place in the middle of a strip mall.  They are not trying to impress you.    BUT, the omelets are really good!  5-eggs, in every possible combination you can think of.  The potatoes are like thick chips and SOOOO yummy.  The plates are huge: I'm a big guy, and even I can't finish a full plate.  If you can deal with the servers, the wait, and the decor, the end result is really worth it!  Place is kid friendly, but large groups are probably going to have to wait a while...like I said, it's a small place with a few room extensions.  Every friend I've brought to this place has become a fan and returned on their own.  That should tell you something.  =)  If you did the drive to Vegas, and it's your last day, I would totally recommend this place as your last stop before you hit the long road back to LA."}
{"text":"Little bit of a wait, but well worth it! Food is delicious and filling. Prices are extremely reasonable. Over 4 waiters made sure we were comfortable and happy. If you are able to ask for a certain waiter ask for Nate, he is extremely helpful. Definitely plan on returning soon."}
{"text":"Well...we finally made it to the infamous Omelette House.  Was it all it was cracked up to be??? I'm sure you guessed by my 5 star review...YES!!! We 1st went on a Saturday morning...the parking lot was FULL. The line to get in was long. The people leaving looked incredibly happy and overheard many say...God I am so full.  Now, if you are looking for a swanky Las Vegas restaurant...don't come here. If you want one of the BEST breakfasts you have ever had, served by friendly staff...COME HERE!   The owner sat us, we thought the wait would be really long...but this place is deceiving from the outside. It is HUGE inside. A maze of rooms, each in an old country theme.  They are of course known for their omelettesso we had to try. I had the Californian. Sausage, avocado, cheese. Now mind you, this isn't an ordinary omelette...it is a 6 egg omelette, with a TON of ingredients. Normally they say avocado...it's topped with 3 little slices, not here....packed full! The sausage was yummy and the cheese was just the right amount.  Now for the man's order...he is not a huge fan of omelettes...he loves chicken fried steak, potatoes and biscuits and gravy.  They just happen to have a chicken fried steak omelette so he gave it a try. He said it was great...but for him...the gravy is a huge deal. He said and I quote \" It is the best gravy I have ever had in a restaurant!\" The biscuits were cut in half, grilled, buttered and then covered with sausage gravy!!!  I say customer service is a lost art...but you can tell the owner makes this a priority...the staff was so nice and we never had an empty cup. The food was served fast...and when we left they gave us a to go cup for the road!  We have been back, on a Thursday and it was just as busy, just as tasty and friendly. We will be making this our go to place for breakfast and will be taking all of our visitors here to enjoy as well! Thank you for doing breakfast right!!"}
{"text":"Omelet house was on point but I just wasn't in the mood today! The food and service was great! Got the pancakes scrambled eggs n sausage patties! Food was out fast an everything was hot n fresh. I think I'll go with the waffles next time, I was just feeling some type of way today I guess. Coffee constantly on refill n great atmosphere, give this love a chance n bring ur appetite bc portions are huge!!!"}
{"text":"Great quick service potatoes were my favorite part. Like home cooked potato chips. Good prices too"}
{"text":"I loved their banana bread. It came out nice and warm. They actually give you a choice of what kind of baked good you prefer - banana bread, pumpkin something or toast. When I ordered, the waitress asked me if I wanted a \"Baby\" omelette and I shrugged out an \"okay\" and gave her a funny look. Thank God she asked me that cuz I saw the other portions which were humongous. Apparently the normal omelettes use 6-8 eggs, while the baby ones use 3 eggs.  The inside is very dated and needs some serious remodeling, but I appreciated how the staff knew everything on the good-sized menu by heart, that it was noticeably family owned, and that there was a very entertaining balloon guy that made everyone smile.  Don't expect first class digs, but the food will satisfy you completely."}
{"text":"Excellent! If you are looking for a GREAT breakfast at a decent price you MUST eat here! OMGosh! Your journey to nirvana begins with menu. Wonderfully name entrees, great combinations, something for everyone and you haven't even eaten yet! Check out menu item #33 1/2! Soooo funny! Next, portions.....incredible! Bring your appetite and expect to bring home a doggie bag! (Too good for the dog, sorry Rover, we're not sharing these leftovers!!!) you can order your omelette at full size or baby size. Don't be fooled! The baby size is still bigger than anybody else's!! The side potatoes, affectionately named Spuds, are fresh potatoes, sliced and cooked to perfection!! The bread options include the standard fares but check out the pumpkin bread or the banana bread, a meal in themselves!!! We all ordered different omelette a and we all hummed as we ate! Doggy bags were taken home and dinner round two!!! Couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"NEW REVIEW: Husband wanting to treat his two ladies to breakfast/brunch on Sunday and he chose to come back here.  We had about a 10 minute wait which wasn't bad at all.  The menu has so much to choose from.  It was only 11:00AM and we could order anything.  My husband ordered a omelet, I ordered a BLT and believe it or not my daughter wanted a cheeseburger.  My husband's omelet filled his whole plate with just a little room for the homemade chips and then he got toast on top of it.  I loved my BLT, the bacon was extra crispy and my fries were wonderful.  Daughter ate her whole cheeseburger.  I just love the decorations here on the wall - you really feel like you are in your grandma's kitchen.  Mom visiting soon from California and we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is weird and adorable, the food was great, It wasn't too expensive and the wait was only a few minutes.  The place was laid out like a maze, every time you turn a corner it looks like a different building and it was full of weird little knick knacks.  The food was MASSIVE; the omelets filled the entire plate and the pancakes (which I got) were some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wow.  I tried this place on a whim, and was NOT disappointed.  It's larger than you expect.  It's tucked away in some tiny mall, out of the way, and completely unassuming.  Inside, the place is surprisingly HUGE, and very homey.  You can tell the place has been there for a while.  For starters, we got hooked up with a nice slice of pumpkin bread.  It's not overly sweet, but it has a nice amount of spice to make it incredibly tasty.  Then the meal came.  The missus got chicken fried steak, and it was delicious.  I got lobster eggs benedict.  Honestly, I was expecting something lame and wimpy, as every restaurant thinks a few little sprinkles of shredded lobster here and there suffices in any related meal.  What I got was CHUNKS.  Big, wonderful chunks of tasty sweet lobster on both parts, and the entire experience was just awesome.  I more than got what I paid for.  Prices are great, service is fast, the staff is friendly, and the wait time to be seated was surprisingly short.  It was nice to eat in  place that had a little personality, and you could tell they've been around for a while.  After eating breakfast there, I could see why.  This weekend, \"whims\" paid off, and I have a new place to frequent.  It's nice to know that I can still find \"new\" things in the neighborhood. Recommended."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here and I have loved it both times. All of the staff is friendly and helpful despite being incredibly busy. Our coffee and water cups were always full and dirty plates were off the table minutes after we were done.   Not only is the staff incredible the food is wonderful, and a great value for the amount you get.   Splurge and get the pumpkin bread or banana bread as your breakfast side. It's AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! Huge portions, delicious fresh food, tons of choices, good service. We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was a quick stop the first time and a long stop the second time! way yummy food awesome staff who was nice and helpful. and if you like breakfast foods you will love this place. the chicken fried steak was yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a small chain..there are three we have visited two and only recently realized they were the same. awesome food, friendly service and super large portions! I love the home fried chips that come with the omelets and the pumpkin bread is so delicious! the decorations give a home-like feel and some you can purchase.  The Chicken fried steak is very tasty and you really do not need the knife that comes with it. The servers are friendly, answer questions with a smile and quickly refill drinks!"}
{"text":"A family friendly(and family owned) diner-style restaurant.   Brunches on Sunday are a must (I highly recommend the lobster eggs benedict-YUM!). Portions are pretty big so go hungry! They have plenty of omelet options, and a wide variety of lunch & dinner options to choose from.  If you see memorabilla you like, you can probably buy it (Elvis cookie jar anyone?)"}
{"text":"Great service.   Food potion was huge and the price is right.  Loved the Cowboy Omelet.   Shirley was great at her job."}
{"text":"Service amazing, friendly and so pleasant.  Got the chili Verde omelet. AWESOME!  Don't get fooled by the location or the look from the outside.  This place is not fancy but it great food."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 3 stars because the food is really good, unfortunately the other 2 stars aren't warranted because of the lack of service. The food here has always been pretty good but the service or shall I say lack there of has always seemed a little suspect. As a person that has worked in the industry it seems as though they act as if \"not one single person can break us\"is the matter of which some of these servers care for the people they serve because they do stay pretty busy. I think the servers there need a refresher class in how they serve people in their establishment or fired whichever works. Okay rant over...."}
{"text":"The best deal in Vegas period. Best freshest food in town and price ain't bad either. The banana nut bread is to die for. Lola was awesome with the service."}
{"text":"After hearing many great things, we finally made it to the Omelet house for the first time yesterday. It was Father's Day, and when we drove in to the lot there were a lot of cars and we thought uh oh, we're in for a wait. Not so! Kevin (the owner/manager I think?) greeted us immediately, as did two other staff members, and we were seated in a great booth (normally reserved for the Mayor of Las Vegas!) right away. Every host and server we spoke to was warm and attentive. Our server, Devynn, was outstanding! She answered our questions about the extensive menu and we chose to order two 'baby' size omelets, made with three eggs instead of six. They were still huge and delicious! The banana bread was SO GOOD. Our daughter had a yummy pancake. The drink server was always on hand preemptively offering coffee refills. The good came out hot and fast. I cannot fault any aspect of our experience, it was superb all round! Our only regret is that we didn't start going to breakfast there earlier!"}
{"text":"The best customer service I have ever had! The food is great and the portions are pretty big *you can share a plate* I am sad it's so far from home but will be coming here when I visit Las Vegas soon."}
{"text":"Came here to eat breakfast with my family and WOW! What a huge breakfast selection!! The restaurants ambience has it setting in a 1950s All-American time warp, with a warm, & welcoming feeling.  It's a pretty big breakfast diner, being able to fit parties of all sizes.  I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict with Bacon instead of Ham & an order of Belgian style Waffles. The Hollandaise sauce was AWESOME! Probably one of the best I've had. My Waffles were good & went perfect after eating my Eggs Benedict.  Really good customer service from the staff. This won't be the last time I visit the Omelette House!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The best breakfast deal in the city! The options, quality and quantity of food can't be beat."}
{"text":"It was our first time at The Omelet House after deciding I can't do IHOP any longer. Well, My husband and I were promptly seated and greeted by our server. This has now became one of our favorite breakfast joints. We had the kitchen sink which consists of every darn thing however phenomenal. They're are 35 different varieties of omelets so take your time when ordering. What more can I say besides LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!"}
{"text":"Solid place to eat lunch.  Sometimes I have eaten breakfast foods for lunch.  Quality food, friendly service.  Parking is a bit of an issue and sometimes meters is the only option.  If they had fries instead of the slightly odd (IMO) homemade chips, this place would be my number one lunch joint."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Close to my house and church.  Took my little man there after church for a mommy/son lunch not long ago.  Good service.  Good food.  In the past, we have gone with all four of us.  Service/food delivery is a little slow for the 4 year old, but my 8 year old has a bit more patience."}
{"text":"Loved it but biscuits and gravy were sooooo salty - they were nice about it and didn't charge   We had the chili omelet - never had one - and it was amazing  People are so nice there!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast. Enough staff, friendly, quick. Decently priced and close to the factory outlet center. We will be back."}
{"text":"Everything was great! Huge omelet served with thick cut potato chips that at soft but still have a crisp. Some of the best sourdough toast I've had."}
{"text":"This is a go to brunch place for anybody visiting Vegas. Friendly staff and a homely atmosphere. Omelettes were really good. So was the hot chocolate and the coffee we ordered."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best place for an omelet no matter how you spell it.  It is my first stop after an early morning flight into Las Vegas and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Stop with our tour to the Hoover Dam.  The food was amazing.  The staff was friendly and they were on top of every need from the group.  I did not give 5 stars because i do not know the pricing."}
{"text":"This review is for a couple years ago, but somehow my posting didn't get posted until now...  The 40+ minute wait at Hash House, on and off strip, was not appealing to the guys I was with, so my cousin recommended this place. The fast seating and service here are great!   I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine. The hollandaise sauce was the best I've ever had, and it went well with the spinach and mushrooms. The potato chips were awesome too...slightly crispy on the edges and soft in the center. The other guys ordered omelettes, which they seemed to enjoy too.  Most likely you won't be walking away from this place without a box to go."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"kitchen sink.\" This should be featured on man vs. food. It's huge! Really good too. The pancakes, potatoes at this place are great. The service is excellent. They do not let your coffee cup go close to empty. Don't let the shady exterior strip mall look fool you, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place.  Had a traditional breakfast and the biscuit and gravy benedict.  I'd give it a 'meh' rating although this is only a couple things from their menu. The toast and orange juice were delicious, friendly service and clean establishment. Prolly won't go back though."}
{"text":"Came to have brunch and read great reviews, so we gave it a try. food was good and their portions are generous. If you're looking for a good breakfast or lunch spot, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"A nice mom and pop style breakfast joint...  When I first walked into this place, it reminded me of Blueberry Hill or some sort of country style place with cookie jars, things with roosters, those \"stained glass\" lampshades, and autographed pictures of famous people who ate at the restaurant.  My friends and I heard that the portions here were huge, so we decided to split our meal. We ordered the Jolly Green Giant omelette which included various veggies like zuccini and broccoli (~$8.50), and a full stack (3) of buttermilk pancakes (~$5). The omelette came with their home made potato chips or their \"duds\". You can also choose a side like toast, banana nut bread (We got this, and it was DELICIOUS!), pumpkin bread, or a biscuit. Our choices were both really scrumptious! It was definitely a good idea to split everything in half.  My other friend ordered the \"Flap Jack\" special, which included two pieces of bacon (or 1 sausage), 2 eggs, and 2 pancakes for $6.99. Great deal, eh?  This will not be the last time I go here for breakfast! The service was excellent here, as the servers were very friendly, I might add!"}
{"text":"The food, such as pancakes and waffles are very good. The only complaint I have, is the coffee is lukewarm after adding creamer. I like hot coffee, but I don't care much for it without cream and sugar. Maybe if they heated the cup first? (Just fill it with hot water) That's what I use to do when I was a waitress (oh, food server, sorry)."}
{"text":"As breakfast/lunch places go this is a more than solid standby.  Their omelets are excellent and they have such a large list of combinations that it could take your entire lunch hour to decide.  Their portions are large but you can order a \"baby\" omelet that will more than fill most people up.  If you want to skip the home made potato chips, they will substitute fruit or tomato.    Definitely one of our goto lunch places."}
{"text":"Went to the one at Boulder and Russell. First of all I have eaten at the Omelet House ever since I came to Las Vegas and this is by far the worst it has ever been! The service was nonexistent. The spuds must have been several days old. The OJ was warm. The #7 Omelet was just OK. I will NOT go back to this one. There is one about 4 or 5 miles south on Boulder in Henderson that has always been better !"}
{"text":"I have lived in the Las Vegas / Henderson area for 32 years. I made my first trip to the Omelet House last week. and I am glad that I did. The food was great and the service was even better.  Just a note I went to the other Omelet House on Boulder Highway and Russell. I will never go there again.  I can't wait to go back to this one again."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time and I will never go back again. We were greated by beggers outside who told us that they were hungry and could we help them out. I offered to buy them breakfast but they turned me down and asked if they could just hae the money.  We went inside and waited way to long for a hostess. After being seated at a table with a view of the people begging outside we were brought our coffee and our orded was taken. The food was acceptable the service was not. Our coffee was never refilled and it took forever to get our check. It took even longer at the counter to pay our bill. The lady would not get off the phone and take our money.  Upon leaving we were once again approached by the beggers outside and asked once again for some money.  Even after telling our waitress about the people asking for money outside nothing was done about it.  I went to the mens room and 4 waitress/ hostess were sitting at a table eating and talking.  Perhaps this is why the service was so poor.  I should have known from the time we walked up to the place to go somewhere else when I told 2 homeless men that I would buy them breakfast there and they turned me down and asked if they could have the money instead.  They knew better that to eat at this place."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Omelette House for the past 15+ years.  It is always my \"go to\" place when I have out of town visitors (and a great excuse to go for breakfast.)  Two must orders are the fried zucchini and the pumpkin bread.  I took a friend this morning (she was hooked a few years ago so we always go at least once when she is here.) The food was great.  Breakfast scramble, waffle special and, of course, a 1/2 order of zucchini.  Gavin was our waiter.  I will say that while I have always received good service, today was stellar. Gavin was second to none as a waiter.  Food came out hot. Drinks were kept full.  He did not hover, but made sure that all was good at our table.  Thank you, Gavin!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok. I've lived in Nevada 11 years. I've driven by here everyday almost. Finally ate there today. It was great. Great food , great service , wasn't an issue at all. I highly recommend it. We always go to IHOP but you definitely get way more for your money here."}
{"text":"We went here looking for something good other than the buffet/restaurant  on the strip. Great breakfast place and the warm pumpkin bread was delicious!  I would definitely come back here"}
{"text":"This breakfast/brunch place goes on my list as the \"Best of the Best,\" (for Omelets.)  The service that we had was 5-star and the food taste and portion size was 5-star.  We had a great incredible waitress--Amanda, but I did notice that another woman that came to our table at the end of the meal to help out was a lot less friendly and sourpussed so I am glad that we were not stuck with her otherwise this may have been a very different review.  I had the egg white omelet, veggies, add chicken with the banana nut bread and potatoes.  The Omelet was a 6 on a 1 to 5 scale.   Off the scale!  It was approx. 14.00 before tip.  The included banana nut bread was a 4 of 5--excellent taste but unhealthy.  The potatoes were a 2 of 5--really could not eat too many they were so greasy and oily and tasted from oil. Yuk!  Would definitely return for the Omelet again and try to substitute the potatoes for something else.  Restroom Side note:  The men's restroom here was a nose holder.  It was dirty, urine smell, and you had to hold your nose and get out quickly.  They probably can't clean properly because the wall tiles and floor tiles look like splattered urine so you can't know if you cleaned it.  It's not like solid white where you know immediately if you missed a spot.   My partner was unable to use the woman's restroom it was so dirty."}
{"text":"Bobster Lenedict! That is what you will sound like when someone asks, \"hey what are you eating?\"  Your response will be skewed only because of the explosion of flavors in your mouth!  Aside from all the amazing offerings here, hands down I must say that I was hooked on the Lobster Benedict from the first time I had it.  It has been hard to try anything else, especially since I don't normally frequent this place unless I need a fix.    Although, the lobster chunk sizes has been varying, I understand that there are many factors that affect this such as, season, the economy and even natural disasters...yes i get deep when it comes to food yall.  Please believe me...budabyebye....  I have yet to ask if it is genuine lobster meat, it would shatter me to learn otherwise, but if yall get a chance to ask, let me know the verdict.  The OJ tastes like pasteurized and from concentrate, not fresh squeezed, but not why I am there.  Someone can verify this as well. #PassingTheBuck  Although, my favorite breakfast place is still Cinnamon's back in Honolulu (half and half lox with kalua pork benedict), this place goes an extra step with the exquisite nobleman offering of the king of shell fishes.  Baby Stacks attempts to give Cinnamon's some rubs, and aside from convenience, does a decent job with their own kalua pork benedict.  Next time, I may get creative and add spinach or maybe grilled onions, we shall see.  In the meantime, let me know what you guys think of it, grazi!"}
{"text":"This is a breakfast place like a breakfast place should be.  You can say it is a little run down or you can say it just has a homey feel to it.  The service is efficient - not exactly friendly - but good.  I kinda wanted to call the wiatress \"Flo.\"  Just for fun...  Anyways, I had the Huevos Ranchero.  I don't know why I would pick that here, but I did.  It was the best gosh darn sauce I have ever had.  It had some umami too it.  Tasty.  Muy Bueno.  Large portions too.    The place was very crowded."}
{"text":"A Must place for breakfast!!!! Unbelievable food, unbelievable service!! Top notch, if your in vegas, eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Portions are big and enough to share. Banana bread is great!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good home style cooking. I like it alot. I love breakfast. My kids love it too.Cant beat the price and quality of the food at all."}
{"text":"All I can say is, don't judge a book by its cover! The food was great, the service was great! I got the 38 special omelette. It was HUGE! I actually ended up taking half of it home. Now I can say that was the first time I had leftovers from breakfast. Our waitress Jenn was excellent. She was very friendly and helpful. As were the rest of the staff. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area. Forget about the big hotel buffets, go to the Omelette House! One last word of advice, try the pumkin or banana bread."}
{"text":"I ordered the mile-high city omelette and added tomatoes. It was excellent and huge! With the potatoes, you won't be able to finish everything. The atmosphere is interesting, very kitsch with lots of vintage ceramic figurines. The service was kind of slow but our server was nice."}
{"text":"Nothing like a hearty breakfast to soak up late night Vegas partying!! Lots of different omelet options, huge portions, and banana or pumpkin bread = heaven!! Coffee was constantly refilled with a smile. Will most definitely be back next time I'm in Sin City!!"}
{"text":"This is a fast food restaurant with a very good, quick and friendly service although if you love eggs Benedict better order something else, their omelets are huge and really tasty. Eggs benny are a fried egg version of the traditional recipe and the reason they gave me for not making it as it should be is because the are a fast food restaurant and they don't have time to poach eggs, which to me is unnaceptable if you offer eggs benny, better call it eggs benny style. Anyways as I said tasty food, super service and good ambiance"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last year with a few co-workers who raved about this place. It was very busy on a Saturday morning and a good breakfast but that was it. I recently came back because I was in the area and wanted a good breakfast. I wanted to give it another try. This time I came on a Thursday morning. It was still busy but this time there was no wait and the service was great! It had a very \"home-y\" feel and I loved it! The omelets were huge with homemade potato chips and your choice of toast, or banana bread. I had about 3 cups of their coffee it was delicious. I definitely plan on coming back next week :)"}
{"text":"We went here based 100% off yelp reviews. We had waffles,beef hash and loved both. The coffee was perfect and my cup was never low at all! The staff was super friendly and attentive. The prices are good and the portions are plentyfull. I will come back next time im in town. The bannana nut bread was sooooooo yummy. The have to your payment in back it might take couple minutes so just have another cup of coffee and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to breakfast here especially after reading reviews and drooling over the pictures on yelp. brought the family in (6 of us) and was seated almost immediately. ordered coffee and took some time to look over their HUGE menu.   peeve #1 - coffee was not HOT. none of my refills were hot. ugh.   here's what we ordered: lobster eggs benny x2, cinnamon apple stuffed french toast, 2 egg bfast special, egg white omelet with veggies, flap special (2 pancakes, eggs & bacon) along with a full stack (hubs was hungry), banana bread  lobster eggs benny: smelled and tasted obscenely fishy. hollandaise could have been powdered knorr. egg yolk was not runny. avocado seemed wrong and out of place. would not order again  stuffed French toast: 14 yr old loved it. pictures showed sliced apples in a cinnamon type glaze but he rcvd diced apples   2 egg bfst special: typical egg breakfast with bacon and toast  egg white omelet: mom-in-law was pleased - omelet was fluffy and veggies good (again, nothing to warrant the $11 price tag in my opinion)  flap special with short stack: all 5 pancakes had to get sent back. had the texture of premade pancakes that's been sitting out waiting for its next victim. I mean customer. they made the hubby 5 more pipping hot fresh pancakes. eggs and bacon were standard  banana bread: pipping hot fresh out of the microwave. how do I know?? because after a few minutes, it turned gummy and tough the way bread gets after you nuke it.  lastly, everything was served with \"spuds\". no one ate theirs. it's a cross between kind of a homemade semi soggy chip and country potatoes I think. whatever they were supposed to be, they didn't taste good.   maybe i'm picky. or expect too much. overall food is alright but most definitely does not warrant their prices - breakfast for 6 including luke warm coffee and 2 milks that they forgot to initially bring out, $90 not including tip. yes, portions are big but quality is low. seriously this is basic diner fare nothing to rave about or be amazed with. up your quality/standards and the price you guys are charging will be on par."}
{"text":"Good food good pricing some service is better than other but over all it is a good experience.  The whole $1 for an extra plate is stupied. There bannana bread is yumy as hell."}
{"text":"Great place. Many options and we enjoy sharing a plate. We always come by when we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My visitor to Vegas is an avid traveler retired military and has eaten breakfast all over the world. Today is the day he stopped our waiter Nick and said \"I've eaten all over the world Nick...and this is the best omelet I've ever had\"! He's going to recommend to all his friends and family!"}
{"text":"Food that never disappoints. Portions are huge. Service is always pretty good. Never left here hungry or with a complaint.   Kitchen sink omelette is fat kid friendly!! Nom mom nom  I usually order breakfast but the lunch menu is always on point as well.   Gets busy on weekends but they do a good job keeping things moving along."}
{"text":"Service and food was exceptional! Our drinks were never less than half full. The portion of the food is very generous, and like others have said you get your choice of toast, banana bread, or pumpkin bread. Would eat here everyday if we lived here."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything I'm in town I make it a point to come here . Food is always great lots of food. The price is always right. You can't go wrong with the banana bread. I tried the pumpkin but I always go back to banana bread. Others beg to differ. My favorite omelette is the green giant omelette . You will not be disappointed Ted with a side of polish sausage."}
{"text":"Family friendly and old fashioned dining with good service. This place has been around forever. There are several locations but I come here since it is in my work neighborhood.  I stopped in on this day to have lunch with a friend. I usually order an omelette or breakfast item but this time I tried the Just A Hamburger with their signature chips. I also shared a piece of their delicious banana bread which is one of their featured items. They also serve pumpkin bread which is just as yummy. My burger was huge! I ordered it San Francisco style with Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing and pickles. It was really tasty and definitely one of the better burgers I have had in a while. I also really enjoy their breakfast items. There is much to choose from including pancakes, French toast, omelette and various egg dishes served with or without meat. The portions are large so sometimes I share a meal with a friend.   The service is always friendly and employees that work here have been dedicated to this family owned restaurant for quite some time. There is nothing fancy to the decor, just kitschy and unique. I always feel at home dining here like I just got back from a long trip. This place is definitely a throwback to old Las Vegas and I hope it never changes!"}
{"text":"I've had this place on my bookmarked list for a while now and today we finally tried it. There was no wait even on a busy Sunday morning. The menu was large but not too overwhelming. The servers were fast and efficient, the portions were huge! You could definitely share and have a full plate. I chose the \"health nut\" omelette, my husband had the \"liberty bell\" which was pretty much a Philly cheesesteak omelette. They come with your choice of pumpkin bread, banana bread, or toast, and a large side of \"spuds\" which were thin sliced potatoes that tasted like a mix of fries and potato chips. We were very satisfied, checkout was quick, service was quick and the food was great. We'll be back. The only negative i could possibly include is that there aren't many kids choices."}
{"text":"If your looking for giant sized delicious omelets this is the place to go. They have a large selection or will make what you ask.  We have always had good service and good food."}
{"text":"Good spot in Henderson for Breakfast.   Lots of food!  Share a plate!"}
{"text":"Vegas will always be competitive with abundance in food for cheap. Buffets everywhere, fancy places or just regular chain restaurants at you convenience ! This restaurant is a hidden place we found, We go back every time we visit Las Vegas ! It's a highlight of our trip every time!! The fresh bread, the selection of omelets.. Very reasonably priced!! It's a must go !!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best breakfast hands down!!! And the wait staff is the greatest... The food is top notch I will definitely tell all my family and friends..."}
{"text":"I cant wait to come back!!  Location. Near the back. Kinda hard to spot from the street.  Menu. Lotta stuff to choose from. I have a decent menu pic so zoom in to scope out the gazillion options.  Foods. Basic. Nothing fancy nothing crappy some chiles or hot sauce cant fix. The portions are epic. This make any fatty happy v(^^)v  I only got ommletes here. The liberty aka philly cheeseteak ommie was delish. Not too saturated with beef with plenty of shrooms and peppers.  The sad part is no hash browns. I dont know what its officially called but they give u potato chips. Super salty and oily. I didnt touch em.   The homemade breads, banana or pumpkin is a must. Do not get standard wheat or sourdough. These homemade puppies are badass. I think the pumpkin bread tasted better. They are nice, fresh and hot out the oven (or microwave). Check the pics, im pretty sure i took a shot of the steam but there was poor lighting even with flash so dont quote me on it.  Blueberry pancakes were ehhhh. Very little blueberries considering the flapjack appeared to boast a 10\" diameter. For you dummies, that just means its a big ole pancake like texas sized chicks :P  Sarcasm aside, the service was top notch. Everyone was polite, it seemed like all the staff is from the South cause thats what i got. Contrary to fake news cnn, the south (think alabama or trump voters regions) have amazing hospitality. Southern hospitality is no joke!  Price. Cheap for the overall package.  Im glad to find more of these gems in viva cause the whole casino foods and buffet got old and nastaaaay."}
{"text":"Coffee and pancakes and eggs were delicious.  Very good service!   Kids liked the chocolate milk.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I feel so bad giving this hidden gem only 3 stars!  Omelet House is not very far from where I live, so I love how convenient it is.  I have been here a couple of times, but today was a little bit late, around 1pm.  When we walked in there was no hostess or server available to sit us, so we just kind of stood there for a few minutes waiting (there were plenty of open tables).  Once we were sat, the waitress took our drink order (me, a chocolate milk, my Mom, a Mr. Pibb).  A different waitress came a few minutes later to take our food order, but she seemed pre-occupied by another table and quickly wrote everything down.  My Mom had the apple stuffed french toast, which was REALLY good.  I definitely think cream cheese can make (almost) anything better, and this was no exception.  After reading so many other reviews, I decided to order the lobster bene.  I was very hesitant, because it is one of their more expensive items ($9.79), and I assumed that they would skimp on the lobster and avocado.  I was wrong!  This was way more food than I could've possibly eaten.  There were 2 small english muffins, topped with \"lobster\" (it may not be REAL lobster, but whatever it is sure tasted good!), and a ton of sliced, fresh avocado.  It was topped with 2 poached eggs, which were a bit overcooked, and very good hollandaise sauce.  On the side were the sliced potatoes.  Overall, everything was delicious!  Our server was nothing exceptional, she was more worried about her sidework than her tables, but we didn't really need anything anyhow.  We did order a side of corned beef hash, and although I appreciate that they are trying to be different, the meat was just too dry.  It was flavorful though.  Not sure I would order that again.  I look forward to going back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Great service!! This  is the older location  and you get a cool nostalgic feel. Every time im in town I come here with my family. They have a great novelty selection all around the restaurant if you choose to buy one. Everything from 1960s star trek to I Love Lucy and many more older era goodies."}
{"text":"Really good food!! The pancakes are buttermilk wonders, the banana bread was served warm and steaming fresh from the oven. So nice. Had chicken fried steak with the potato chips which was different for breakfast but very tasty. Had to add some bread to the check to take home!! The service was great and we were offered coffee refills constantly. Very affordable and I have tons of leftovers for later! I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Waited about 5 minutes after check in with our party of 10 and a high chair.  The host had fixed our table at a section where it was tight so went to another section and assembled the tables where it was more comfortable.  We were sat and greeted by two servers for beverage orders but WiTHOUT menus.  We got beverages a few minutes later orders were taken.  Food didn't take long as the restaurant wasn't that busy.  Other assistant servers were doing refills on beverages and check backs on our food.   We had previously asked for two checks but decided to combined them but it would be done at the cashier.  There were four employees at the front and the cashier didn't know how to do our combined checks and military discount.  They also implied that service charge wasn't included in our second check so that had to be added on as well.  The entire process of combining checks and getting discounted took a few minutes because the lack of experience from employees asking each other how it is done.  Very disappointing and frustrating to have waited just to close a check.  No manager was around to assist the employees. Overall the food was good as stated here on Yelp but the host and cashier needs a lot of improvement soon!!!"}
{"text":"Place:  kitschy, not here for ambiance, although it was a neat little country diner-ish type place.  Seems that many people riding motorcycles also frequented this place.  If there were such a thing I think I'd call it a biker breakfast boutique ... LOL.  Food:  The breakfast was certainly one of the best that we encountered on our journey.  The omelet was indeed huge and all the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  The pancakes were also very large and fluffy, tasty treats.  Even the waffle was good, crispy on the outside, tender in the middle.  Bottom line: Can't go wrong here - great food, great service.  Only thing slightly lacking might be the ambiance, but seriously, it's breakfast ... shut up and eat."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Henderson/Vegas! My family and I loved everything we ordered. There are 6 of us so we got to taste everything from the omelets to the waffles to the pancakes and everything was awesome! The service was super friendly and fast. The whole feel of the restaurant is very home-like and old-fashioned. This is definitely our new breakfast spot! Check it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A real great find thanks to a local friend who met us here while we we're stay in town. Don't spend your money eating breakfast at a casino, eat here for half the cost. One if the best omelet I have had and the service was great."}
{"text":"Middle of no where but worth driving for their breakfast.  We yelped this place because someone said it was the best corned beef hash in town.  They were pretty much right on.  My boyfriend loved it!!  The pumpkin bread was good, but I wish they didn't nuke it.  When it cools down, it gets spongy.  Big portions, especially the omlettes.  Coffee isn't bad either!  Thumbs up.. we'll be back."}
{"text":"This hugely popular breakfast/brunch place is located less than 2 miles from the strip, hidden in a dilapidated strip mall off Charleston Blvd. The locals seem to know where it is, as there were tons of people in business attire enjoying their lunch break.  We came here on a Monday around 11:30 AM and the place was busy. When we walked in,  there was a dining room to the left and more seating area straight ahead.  We were seated at neither location but we were led to the right and to a huge, hidden dining area. This place was pretty big!!  Like the restaurant, The menu was just as big, as we were given tabloid size laminated menu with one side with omelettes and breakfast items, and on the other side lunch items.I had to take a video of the menu because I wasn't sure my phone could capture the whole thing.  It's took us about 10 minutes to figure out what we want it, and ironically, not one of us ordered the omelet.    We were at the Henderson location 2 years ago and Stephen ordered the house corned beef hash and eggs.   He liked it so much, he decided to order it again here.  Karen had the country scrambler, and I had the ham and eggs.   Stephen's corned beef hash took up almost half the plate along with his to sunny-side eggs. There were chunks of beef, and you could see it definitely was made from scratch.    Karen also had a very generous helping of eggs with chunks of ham and loads of melted cheese. My ham steak was about a half inch thick and took up the entire plate as well.  They had to serve my egg and spuds on a separate plate.   All of the breakfast orders came with their version of spuds, which was a cross between slices of potatoes grilled almost to chip consistency. The breakfast also came with bread, which included their pumpkin or banana nut bread.   Service was a little spotty, as it took a while to get things we asked for. We asked for Splenda, and it took a while, and I never got my refill of my Diet Coke. However, coffee cups were refilled regularly and frequently.  Friendly people, huge portions, are reasons why I can see why this place is very popular on weekends."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, the place is a bit dingy at first glance from the outside. The painted cinderblock exterior is plain, somewhat dirty, and the sign doesn't indicate that things get any better inside. Once you walk in, your initial thoughts are confirmed, and you are blasted in the face with decor that is a mash up of country western \"goodness\" from the 1940s (i.e. probably John Wayne's living room) to the 1970's brown and orange color palette and stained glass craze.   Yet, inside the establishment, your doubts peak, then fall. You begin to appreciate this restaurant. The service is good, friendly, and honestly, the decor grows on you. Though I was not entirely comfortable in the generic restaurant seats with their metal frames and paltry cushions, I looked around in awe. Of course, my vision was not without constant reminders that I was indeed in Las Vegas, but this is true of most establishments in this tourist hotspot.  I ordered an omelette with shrimp and cheddar cheese, though the official name escapes me; it was decent. Furthermore, the shrimp was cooked sufficiently, and I wasn't left with the feeling that the shrimp was left in a tepid pool of water to thaw. In addition to the omelette, I received potatoes. These were quite good as well. It was A LOT of food, and the prices were not exorbitant either.  All in all, I am indeed a fan. A big fan, actually. If you can get past the looks of the interior and exterior, you'll have experienced a gem in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First off it was packed.. But being a Sunday morning I didn't expect anything less. With that being said I had a to-go order and they greeted me immediately. As I sat and waited for my food everyone tat came in was immediately seated even tho it was pretty busy. That's awesome.   The workers are very personable.   I ordered short stack, meat lovers omelette, French toast meal, and large portion of fried zuchinni = $35.  My Hubbz couldn't finish the omelette, and when he was finally full it looked like he didn't even make a dent (it was large portion sizes)  We would definitely return :)"}
{"text":"*military discount*  Ate here again with my dad on Friday 5/22/15 around 10am.    Sydney is the bomb...my dad wanted some tomato slices but didn't wanna pay $1.50 for 3 slices and Sydney hooked him up.  Such a small act of kindness but it meant a lot to me.    I had the waffle this time...omg soooo good.  And the banana bread is irresistable as always."}
{"text":"I ordered steak and eggs the steak was low-quality meat and color was off.  It tasted like liver. Never went back.  For steak and eggs you have to go to the rainbow casino on water Street in Henderson."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in vegas! Nice friendly people serving  good country home style cooking!"}
{"text":"One of the best local, non-chain diners to get a great meal and fabulous service. Get the zucchini fries, they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was spectacular! They serve heaping proportions and the customer service is second to none.   We ordered the chili verde and lobster omelet. The warm banana nut bread mets in your mouth. Highly recommended eatery."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I absolutely love how friendly they are if you need to take something back. Their sausage patties are amazing! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem thanks to Yelp. It's a little off the strip but worth the drive. My omelet was top notch."}
{"text":"We were going to do Dennys or I Hop because they are easy. Both my husband and I usually like to take the path less traveled. How we found this place was our fortune. From the outside, this place looks like nothing. On the inside, it's all hustle. It's never-ending. It's a bit worn and very old school. You can tell it's kept with a lot of TLC. I ordered the waffle with bananas, walnuts and whip. He ordered ham and eggs. While we waited the sweet waitress Jennifer brought us a slice of banana nut bread with butter. That certainly did the trick to wake up my taste buds. They were screaming: More!  More! Did I mention I was dragging from the night before? When our food came the potatoes in my husband plate were homemade potato chips. Wow, they were the best I have ever had! The delishiousness set before me was so scrumptious! The food was really good my taste buds were screaming...Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lobster eggs Benedict. For lobster it was a pretty good deal being only $2 more than the regular benedict. As an eggs benedict though, it was only ok. The chips on the side were good if they had a lot of seasoning on it or were soaked in the hollandaise sauce but otherwise didn't add much to the breakfast. The pumpkin bread was pretty good though. The service was okay as well. One spilled water on us, which happens, but didn't do much to help us clean it up. Overall the place was ok and I would go again to try something else, but with all the great Vegas breakfasts, it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I live close to this place, but it took me awhile to actually eat at this restaurant. However, when I did stop in, it did not disappoint. This is a very good breakfast place with that old school diner type of feel. There are tons of old photos on the wall (which are for sale might I add) and tons of little nic-naks scattered around. The stuffed French toast is AMAZING, I would highly recommend, however, I love their omelettes as well (egg white one is amazing as well). Coffee is always fresh, and the bread is amazing too. If you ever drive down  boulder highway towards Sam Boyd stadium, do yourself a favor and stop by this place. You won't be disappointment."}
{"text":"I think we made the mistake of coming here right before closing time, my seafood chowder was too thick and creamy with no flavor, my chicken was cold and flavorless, the sauteed mushrooms felt like they only touched the skillet for a second and my husbands chorizo omelette had about 2 pounds of chorizo in it! Gross!   Bad food and bad service ( I even saw a manager wearing shorts), don't come to this location.  Stay far far away!"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan! Was looking for a sandwich place but this one caught my eye.... definitely go for the chorizo omelet (baby version is enough for a moderate eater, otherwise make sure you can keep the leftovers cool enough) and the banana nut bread is AWESOME. I'd go back there right now.... Nice service, no foo foo but straight up great food and very affordable."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in Las Vegas without a doubt. The most friendly servers I have ever seen. Big portions, free refills on your hot chocolate. This is my go to spot for breakfast from now on!"}
{"text":"I always visit this place every time I come to Las Vegas. I recommend this place to everyone when I hear that they're visiting Las Vegas. I hope they enjoy it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Great little whole in the wall, homie type of places. Most likely a local favorite off the strip. It was a lucky find on our Vegas trip and hit the spot.  We split the Farmer Juan omelette and it came with a choice of breads, we choose the banana bread. It was warm and freshly made and so good!! The food was just what we needed and more than enough to split. We also got a single pancake which was also perfect."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas from Houston. on our way to Hoover Dam we were looking for a place to eat and found this place on the map. Thank God we did. Best omelet we've ever had, paired with the most amazing potatoes.  Choose the pumpkin bread, it's a meal (or dessert) all by itself. I'm going to ask them if they expand to Houston!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff and very good food.  You will not leave hungry .... for two days after eating here.  The portions are huge!!  We ordered an omelette and stuffed French toast.  The omelet is made with eggs and comes with potatoes and banana bread.  The banana bread was warm and awesome and could have been enough for breakfast. The omelet was well made and huge! The potatoes are different, sliced thin and fried so they almost taste like potato chips bot hash browns.  My son got the stuffed French toast which was sugary heaven - he had it stuffed with cinnamon apples (pie filling).  It is sweet and gooey.  Really great service, never a half cup of coffee or water before I was refilled.  Expect a wait but expect to also gain some weight!!"}
{"text":"Craving breakfast at 11am, I stopped in here and was lucky enough to find a seat at the counter. It was pretty busy with most tables full, and plenty of staff working the room.   I ordered the chicken fried steak, served on a bed of thin sliced potatoes, two eggs, and toast. One of the better chicken fried steaks in town. Portion was good for me, maybe a touch small for people who love to load up. You guys can order the 6 egg omelet if you are that hungry!  Overall, good food, decent prices, plenty of selection, and friendly staff makes this a place to visit again. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'll do 3.5 stars for the star people out there. Stopped in for a late breakfast/lunch. I remembered the old one farther down Boulder Hwy but this one is newer, cleaner and very nice.  I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs and it was pretty good. Loved the sausage gravy and their potatoes, which are cut thin like potato chips and crispy.Just the way I like them. Service was very good, as it wasn't too crowded on a Thursday around noon.   I'll try them again, the stuffed french toast the guy at the next table ordered looked pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Good food, Service is usually a hit or miss. I do feel some of their add on items tend to feel like your being nickel and dimed"}
{"text":"Been here three times and every time the food and service is amazing!!! I was excited to bring my mother and in laws here, everyone was so happy with the food!! The banana bread is to dieeeeeeee for!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here . My boyfriend and I lovveeeddd it . Samantha our waiter was super kind and sweet along with the other staff. The food was huge and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is of the chain.! Friendly service great advice about Vegas. I would come here 10 times a day if I could."}
{"text":"Its been a year and a half and still just as delicious as ever! Wish they would share their pumpkin bread recipe."}
{"text":"Massive breakfast plates that include potatoes,banana nut bread, and toast! Be careful the omelets are made with six eggs!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Omelet House since I was a child, and my family has always loved it. The food has always been phenomenal for breakfast, and to this day that has still not changed. The reason I have a lower rating, is because of the poor service my dad and I received from a waitress named Sjuana. My father and I met up with my mom and brother there, so they had already been sitting at that table for awhile, which I understand can be frustrating to a waitress when it's rather busy, but that doesn't make it okay to have bad service the rest of our meal. When taking our order, she wasn't paying attention, which became apparent when our food was brought to us and it wasn't correct. We weren't brought any silverware, I had to actively ask for drinks, and butter and syrup to go with my pancakes. I felt unwelcome and rushed my entire meal, and while I would recommend this restaurant for an amazing breakfast spot, I would not recommend her as a waitress."}
{"text":"This is favorite local place, the reason why is because the photos all over the walls of all the celebrities and famous people have eaten there. The is a busy place its the original location so one would think its kind of small but once you get there it seems like they have utilized just about every space they can reasonably think of use. Impressive service, multiple people asking can I get you anything else? Can I refill your drink? May I take that? Polite and the owner is around usually asking people where they want to seat and they honestly say what the wait will be and he will help you get seated quickly. I never once was upset about anything. Oh and go when you are hungry because you will not leave hungry at all."}
{"text":"We wondered in on a super busy, rainy, weekend morning.   People were huddled inside the doorway and all over the entryway around the front desk.   We thought, although the food may be great, this was not what we were ready to sign up for.   Through the crowd, a happy face noticed us come in.   She told us it should only be 15 min or less and there was plenty of room.   We were seated in just 6 minutes and had a great server right away.   Yes, the food was great too.   The pumpkin bread was so good along with perfect fluffy omelets that did not skimp on the avocado or anything else.  Customer Service is expected but Customer Surprise is what makes restaurants get great yelp reviews....Great job all around!!"}
{"text":"This was the most amazing breakfast to end. A classic Memorial Day Vegas trip for a couple of boys from LA.   Had the flap special and wow just amazing. I want to come here more and more and more. Again and again. I recommend it for anyone!"}
{"text":"Came on Father's Day. Very short wait, even on a holiday. The place is cute, very classic outdated but cozy little diner feel. The food was unexpectedly good! My husband got the kielbasa (polish sausage) and it was some of the most flavorful we have had! And we love kielbasa. I wish they had more topping options for the French toast, pancakes, and waffles. All they seemed to have was apple or blueberry topping. I wish they had at least cherry compete or something. My husband was not a fan of the potatoes, which were thin cut and fried. He thought they lacked flavor, but I liked them a lot. Overall great experience, just what I was looking for!  Edit: banana nut bread was amaaaaaaazing."}
{"text":"Great place, great service, so quaint. The omelets are TO DIE FOR, and the banana nut bread was so soft and warm. Also, definitely try the French toast, shoot, try everything! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were on the road for 3700 miles over two weeks and this was our best meal. The waffles are awesome and the friendly service is great!"}
{"text":"I ordered the sausage and biscuit gravy and it is not worth ordering the sausage was good, the biscuit was a joke and most of the plate was sliced potatoes fried like potato chips and Tasted like cardboard"}
{"text":"Our visit to the omelette house was a delightful surprise.  The omelettes were yummy, the service fast, and the ambiance eclectic. Definitely worth a trip off the strip for breakfast"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat! The portions are generous for the price and the servers are kind. Don't eat on the strip, this place offers good home cooking."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast joint! It's located in the back of a strip mall off Charleston Avenue and the food was delicious. To top off the meal, I saw Hall of Famer, Cal Ripken eating at this place so it must get some street cred. I had a Meat Lovers omlette with bacon, sausage and ham topped with cheddar and jack cheese. I also had a side with his incredible polish sausage and potatoes. The price is definitely right and most people were getting to go boxes because the portions are huge and it was my only meal of the day!  A must eat at place in Sin City and the staff is very friendly and my waitress was excellent, friendly and service with a smile. I'll definitely be chowing down here on my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I think my expectations were too high before I arrived. I love me some good eggs Benedict, and my friend had wanted to take me here to try the lobster.   I'm a bit picky, since good Benedict has to have amazingly good sauce. Once that sauce is instant made or out of a bag, it just doesn't taste right.  I wasn't too fond of the sauce on my Benedictus. The banana muffin or bread thing was good. The interior was a bit run-down when I went."}
{"text":"This place was perfect. The service was excellent, the food came pretty fast, and the waiters were ALL over our every need. The best part for me? I asked for Crispy bacon and they made it just like I do at home. So good!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for big portions at an affordable price, look no further. My husband loves their crispy corned beef hash and I like their Mexican influences dishes.   Hot and fast food mixed with friendly service goes a long way!"}
{"text":"We showed up here on a Sunday late morning after the first place we tried to go to down the road had some plumbing issues and had to close unexpectedly.  The parking lot was packed so we had to park across the street from the lot in the back.  We figured we would have to wait a while with it being so crowded but we were almost immediately seated.  Within minutes we had our drinks and shortly after that food was on it's way.  We barely had time to eat our delicious banana bread that came as a bread option with our meals before our food was already being delivered.  Everything was delicious!  Pancakes, omelets, lobster Eggs Benedict - all so good!  And every staff person we interacted with was so pleasant and friendly!"}
{"text":"Would like to give them four stars, but I'm deducting due to the 20min wait time, after calling ahead and being told there was NO WAIT. 20mins isn't long, but an eternity when your hungover and just want to get in the road. With that said, my omelet was amazing. I had the 38 special with six eggs. It was filling, I couldn't even finish. Very generous portion. I'd like to give them another shot, hopefully I can get seated a bit quicker."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!! Servings were enormous. Enough to share. Very delicious and friendly service. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge (6 egg omelet, I think). Their potatoes & banana & pumpkin breads are delicious. They have an interesting assortment of omelets to choose from. They chop the mix-ins in huge chunks (I'd prefer smaller pieces in an equal distribution and more cheese). Service is attentive and sometimes different servers check on you. They have a lot of antique/retro decorations."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!  The Chicken Verde skillet special is awesome!  And our server Geo is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent service excellent food and a wonderful atmosphere. I ordered the Eggs Benedict, best I ever had. You get a lot of food so be hungry when you come."}
{"text":"I still love this place. I remember grabbing breakfast here when I was in high school, 15 years ago. And still to this day, I get the same nostalgia walking through these doors. This is a fantastic mom & pap type place. Home grown, small town vibes. Service is always friendly, fast and inviting and the portions are still as big a circus with prices that can't be beat. What more could ya ask for? The perfect brunch spot, can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Picked our breakfast spot based on location and rating. We made a great choice. The service upon entry was indifferent. However, they warmed up. Staff seemed a little flat overall... But it didn't matter too much as they weren't eating with us. Place seemed clean... Even the little tchotchkes were dusted. Something to note is that their omelette are generally 6! Eggs. I went with 3. The Popeye Omelet was good and had great flavor. The cheeze  to egg ratio was good and not too much. The potatoes were GREAT. We had a piece of their homemade banana bread as an appetizer and that was a good decision My gf went with the Chicken Fried Steak. She thought the size as good and liked the meaty gravy. Both of us commented on the bread used for toast. Real good. They got a little nuts with the butter but still good. Coffee was average and they had flavored creamer.   Service was quick and they didn't bring the check until we were finished...   Worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"Our first visit to the Omelet House and I am sure happy we went! We were in the mood for breakfast so Omelets we got as that is what they are famous for! I decided on the \"Mile High City\" which is basically a Denver Omelet, ham, onions and bell pepper and it was delicious. The side I ordered that came with my meal was the fresh baked walnut banana cake, mmmm so hot and flavorful! I like that they have other choices than the typical option for toast.  My boyfriend got the \"Bugsy Siegel\" which was very tasty, generous chunks of moist roast beef, Italian red sauce, sour cream and jack cheese! The Omelets are huge to say the least, I think the Server said 7 eggs? I took a bite of his Omelet not really sure if I would like that combination however it blew my mind it was so damn good!  The portions are generous, the prices reasonable for what you get! They even have a coupon in the Entertainment book for $7.00 off. We love to eat out and save money so that was a nice added bonus, I am just shocked they have a discount coupon with how big their portions are! It did the job it got us to try a new breakfast place that really delighted our taste buds! We will be back for sure!  My only dislike is that they pair their Omelets with homemade thin potato chips instead of hashed browns or Country style potatoes. The homemade chips I might like better paired with a sandwich for lunch rather than a breakfast omelet. That was just the opinion of my boyfriend and I. We will ask next time if there is a substitution option available instead of the chips.   The service is Amazing, good old fashioned kindness at this restaurant and is very comfortable as it has a Country thrift store theme with all of the decorations on the walls."}
{"text":"Typically I'm not a huge fan of breakfast restaurants as they tend to be boring and \"plain.\"  However; Omelet House does not fit into the previous category as the menu is ridiculous. If you can't find something on this menu that you like, you probably don't like food.  Tons and tons of omelet creations to try that very from simple to outrageous (but you can always customize your own as the staff and kitchen is willing to make customers happy).  Love the chunks of chicken, shrimp, tomato, guacamole and fresh cheeses.  If you happen to not want a fabulous omelet, no fear, the menu does include the typical breakfast offerings of waffles, french toast, pancakes as well as lunch fare.  Extra perks I love: -flavored coffee creamers on the table (yum) -banana and pumpkin bread served with omeletes (HUGE hunks of warm, fresh bread served before your entree) -kitschy decor (makes you feel like you're in \"grandma's house\" as it's not pretentious or stuffy)"}
{"text":"Another great locals spot in Vegas for breakfast! Giant omelets - like 5-6 eggs I believe. Tons of options as well as other breakfast classics. Their potatoes are...different, more lilke a soft potato chip than a hash brown of home fry, but good the same. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I wanted to leave only 2.5 stars, however it was not an option. Omelet house is a place I visit each timeI visit Las Vegas. The omelets are large in portion and the chips are the best chips I've ever had. The pumpkin bread is so amazing I forgo calorie counting when dining here. Sounds like a 5 star worthy rating right?   Wrong, and here's why.   The restaurant closes at 3pm. I visited the restaurant this past Saturday and Sunday, with a group of 6, both days arriving near closing.  On Saturday our food wss great with extra to take home,  however several in our group noticed a \"rushed\" tone and energy from our server. As always, we went back Sunday and I ordered the exact same omelet. An egg white omelet with added lobster and additional veggies. Our food came and I had no lobster in my omelet.  Now, due to many food restrictions and intolerances, I suggested coming here as I know the lobster omelet was satisfying and filling. However, when i told the waitress there was no lobster, she said it was in there because she told her chefs to add it, and she rushed off. I dug more through my omelet looking for lobster, and still no lobster! I told the waitress again and she pointed to egg white and said \"theres the lobster. Its shredded\". The lobster is not shredded. I just had the omelet the day before. I pointed to my friend next to me and said look at her lobster omelet,  it's not shredded. She said, well i told them to put it in there. She then went to confirm with the cooks and they said they put it in there. And offered to take off the $5 upcharge for added lobster.  Herein lies the problem:  Typically when a restaurant gets your order wrong, they can remake or fix your meal.  Because they close at 3, I was informed that my food could not be fixed because the chefs have now left! I dug through my omelet until it was scrambled eggs on a plate and there was no lobster. I told the waitress that i specifically came here and ordered this for the lobster. She took my plate to the back to the managee and it was then it was determined, yes in fact there was NO lobster in my omelet! Yes, the waitress removed the omelet from my bill,  however I left hungry, disappointed and frustrated with the service.  My suggestion to the restaurant:  The waitress takes immediate action if a plate is cooked incorrectly, especially before closing.  The cooks should not leave until the waitress verifies that all plates are prepared as ordered.  Be mindful of your tone, you're still on the clock.  The manager should address an issue with the customer directly. It makes for better customer service  My suggestion to patrons:  Dont visit just before closing. Or be prepared for subpar service.  I do not know if I'll be visiting here again after this experience."}
{"text":"Stopped for my BOGO birthday meal. The special was a pulled pork BBQ sandwich. It was GREAT!!! Not too spicy, just right amount of tang and the bun was the right one - stood up while eating the sandwich at a leisurely pace.   Too bad they aren't open for dinner anymore..."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! I thought I previously reviewed this place but I guess not. You can't go wrong with almost anything on the menu. Big portions that will leave you feeling full and asking for a box. Anyone who is coffee/sweet tooth lover I strongly recommend getting the Iced Mocha to start with. It's so good!"}
{"text":"Very long line. No one working the counter or hostess station, so getting service was chaotic at best. Food was mediocre. Not worth the wait or the chaos of fighting for a seat. If your looking for a stress free pleasant breakfast? Avoid this place.  Please see what the \"Owner\" posted to my initial review of his establishment.    3/9/2016 * I think you have the wrong Omelet House. 1.We always have 5 hosts and one owner working the door on Sundays. 2.We do not have a counter or hostess station. 3. All of our 25+ floor staff are trained to make eye contact with anyone waiting to be seated and, if they are unable to seat the customer, they say something to the effect \"Someone will be with you right away.\"  We are located at Charleston and Rancho. Read less   So, first off?  I was at the establishment listed in the \"Owners\" response.  And I have no idea where his 25+ floor staff were or his hosts for that matter.  Never saw a single one of them helping of addressing anyone at the entry.  No one ever made eye contact, no one ever even recognized we were there.  Secondly, there is a sign when you enter that states \"Pease wait to be seated\".  Thirdly, the \"owner\" states he or she has no \"hostess station but they have 5 hosts! Where do these hosts work out of? What do they do? The \"owner\" needs to accept and own an honest review of his business like it or not. But saying that, what I and my party experienced in his establishment, didn't happen because he says so? Is just a sad and weak retort.  The \"owner\" can post whatever he or she wants.  The truth will be in the service they deliver.  Personally I am insulted by the \"owners\" response, for all intensive purposes, he or she is calling me a liar.  Another sign of a poor manager and a bad business person.  Another sign and another good reason to avoid this establishment."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation. I got the meat lovers skillet and was very pleased with my selection. Out waitress told us about the homemade pumpkin and banana bread- oh...my...gosh-it is amazing! Give it a try, it is served hot and goes well with coffee. Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST breakfast hands down!! Both quality and quantity. I've tried the country style scramble, The mile-high city, the biscuits & homemade sausage gravy and last but not least the pigskin(added fresh avocado).  I am never disappointed when I eat here. They also offer homemade pumpkin or banana bread(always comes out steaming hot). My bf always orders the Homemade corned beef hash and eggs. He says it's the best he has ever.  I recommend early arrival on weekends as it does get busy.  Great family ambiance and great customer service."}
{"text":"Authentic homemade dishes. It was curious to stay here and eat. This place is amazing with friendly staff. The stuffed French toast is terrific, the omelette is huge, and the toast is incredible. I remembered the omelet and again wanted to."}
{"text":"Burgers were really good but oh the potato slices were amazing! We were with a large group and I was so impressed they had everything ready as we arrived! And pralines and cream will make your mouth water!"}
{"text":"My food was good but my moms food wasn't. They offered her terrible customer service when she let the know. Still charged for for her meal and now I feel bad for bringing her to what I thought was a great breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Omg I absolutely love this place! Came here in May for a Vegas weekend getaway (and to also see Magic Mike) and man, I was in love. This place is so good, I came here twice to breakfast.  The staff is super friendly. Our waitress was great and remembered us from the day before and as a bonus, she remembered my avocado omelette with tortillas in on the side. It was so yummy and satisfying. They make homemade potato chips which were crunchy, well salted and good. Washed it down with a great strong up of coffee.   Great environment and interesting decor."}
{"text":"Had a Saturday, before Mother's Day, breakfast. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes, but it turned out to be 50.     That being said, everything after was superb. From the service we received from Terri, to the food portions and quality, we were very impressed. Just what a local diner is supposed to be like.    I had the home made chili omelette, the Cowboy. The eggs were fluffy and the chili and cheese were plentiful. The side of homemade chips was fabulous and the rye toast was very fresh. There were other things on the menu that looked great, like homemade corned beef hash,  and I will try one of them next time in town.    Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We at at Omelet house because of the rave reviews. I will have to agree that the food is quite delicious. The omelette is a great portion. This is an \"off the beaten path\" type of places which I find to be worth it. Prices were cheap and the food is better quality than anywhere I have been with the same prices. Will be going back"}
{"text":"This place is so good! You get plenty of food, you won't leave hungry. Try the corned beef hash, its homemade and sooo good! I recommend the banana nut bread over the pumpkin :)"}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast before our drive out to the Hoover Dam and were quite pleased with both the food and customer service.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a friendly employee and we were seated right away.  The restaurant has a really \"homey\" look and feel to it.    I asked our server for suggestions and she recommended the pumpkin bread and the chicken fried steak.  The pumpkin bread was served with butter on the side and it was really moist and delicious.  The portions were huge and the chicken fried steak was alright.  Believe it or not, my favorite thing was the \"spuds.\"  They're basically sliced, seasoned potatoes.  I would actually go back just for the spuds.    I recommend Omelet House to others and would definitely return for the food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and good customer service , the omelette are amazing, the warm banana bread is divine"}
{"text":"OMG this was the best time I've ever had in my 37 years of living it was huge chips were bomb omelet was huge with lots of meat NF for the chili verde Only complaint I had is that they don't take American Express"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place 15 years ago and I am so happy to be living in Vegas again. I went to another breakfast place today and I regretted not coming here instead. My sister and I ate here last week and always a delicious meal! For people who complain about the size of the omelette if you read the menu you can order the smaller version instead critics cry it's so massive lol whatever! The potatoes did change they used to be very greasy and softer now they're more of a potato chip but thicker and not as greasy as they used to be. The coffee is on point along with the banana bread, never ate a bad meal here."}
{"text":"One of the greatest breakfast places in Las Vegas spots- this place has great food and great service!  I had the eggs benedict- delicious!   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought this rando spot across from UMC would actually have really good breakfast?   Like a diner straight out of the midwest, this place has some charming 80's knick-nacks, friendly service and HUGE portions. The food here is also pretty awesome.  Pancakes are sooo fluffy I could die! They are basically delicious, golden pillows of perfection. I also ordered \"The Californian\" Omelette which was HUGE and loaded with sausage, fresh avocado and yummy melted jack cheese. Served with tasty chips AND your choice of banana bread/pumpkin bread/ toast :) It was so huge, I shared and still took half of it home.   I will definitely be back every morning after my night shift....  Tip: Open 7am-3pm daily. And get the breakfast :)"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place for an easy meal when also looking to get more for your money. As far as diners go, this place is a little better than average. Relatively clean and super quick service most of the time. The coffee isn't that good, but you can ask for real milk or cream to dress it up. The omelettes are gigantic but I wasn't a fan of the home fries (fried potato slices) as they are soft and oily - but they will fry them harder or softer if you ask. The salads are strangely enough super fresh and crisp. I'm not sure I've ever seen anyone else order them, but they are on point with their lettuce! The banana nut bread is worth a try, although hearing the microwave every time it's ordered is unnerving. I know it's the best way to heat up cake but maybe move it to the back?"}
{"text":"We search this place out because we did not want an IHOP or Dennys etc.  I ordered sausage and eggs.  Should have ordered an Omelet like my husband did.  Our meals were very good.  Staff was friendly and seated us quickly.  If I lived in the neighborhood I would make it my go to spot.  Spuds are different and good.    Home like atmosphere, lots of stuff to look at.  I will be back to try an Omelet.    Keep up the good work:)"}
{"text":"FOOD - This was my first time eating at Omelet House and it is seriously the best breakfast I've ever had. I ordered the 38 special omelet and it was packed with delicious sausage, ham, and bacon. The generous cheddar and jack cheese on top was perfect. I was not expecting to be blown away but this is definitely a place I will be visiting every time I travel to Vegas from now on. I also got the pumpkin nut bread with my plate and it was equally amazing as the omelet. My boyfriend had some pancakes and I was able to steal a bite of that. Honestly the best pancake I've ever had as well! I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!  SERVICE - Our server was very friendly and nice. I asked her what the top omelets were and among the ones she listed, the 38 special was one of them. It was an excellent recommendation and I can't wait to try the others.  I love the mom and pop feel of this restaurant and the food is amazing! I could eat breakfast here every single day."}
{"text":"Staying off Strip, I discovered this gem of a place. I love breakfast so this hits the spot.  The menu reminds me of Harbor House in Seal Beach, 80% full of yummy breakfast foods, 20% lunch/dinner type stuff. Great selection of omelets!   Chicken fried steak & eggs were absolutely delightful here. The fried steak wasn't soggied down by the gravy and not too salty. A weakness of many fried steaks I've tried. The fried potato slices were a welcome change from traditional hash browns. You can also choose pumpkin nut bread as a bread side, they're fantastic! http://media2.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mbO66Wvl7CgJnaErZZWEGw/l  My friends thought very highly of their omelets. Greasy breakfast foods are great hangover cures. Y'all know I'll be back here soon."}
{"text":"I actually found this place because of yelp I decided to go have breakfast there last week and it was incredible. I was only able to eat half of the omelette and a part of the pumpkin bread there was so much food it was crazy.  It was excellent... the place isn't anything to look at but the food is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Tried going to IHOP today and it was a ZOO.  So went down to the Omelet House and had a great breakfast. 2 minute wait and a more down home character.  Everything came out perfect, as ordered and their thin cut potatoes are to die for. Egg white omelet and banana pancakes were yummy too.   Only minus is the \"No Substitutions\" on omelets...I hate that rule. They have a \"Huge Iced Mocha\" on the menu, but I was informed it's not made with real espresso."}
{"text":"Buen lugar para ir a desayunar, Como su nombre lo dice \"casa de omelette \" hay variedad de diferentes tipos de omelette al cual no sabes por cu√°l decidirte. Pedimos de dos diferentes para probar y compartir, el plato con porci√≥n grande todo y nuestros panqueques calientes y esponjosos acompa√±ados de nuestro caf√©. Al final nos dan de cortes√≠a un pan de postre creo era pumpkin con almendras."}
{"text":"Pumpkin bread was o so delish.  Omelettes were fabulous.  My fiance's first go from here was actually a to-go order, and when i opened all the boxes and dished up she was like, uh, is someone else joining us??"}
{"text":"I am in love! Dont be hesistant to enter this aged diner because there's so much more to this place than just bomb food! There is a lot of history here and I have always been amused by vintage wall art and decorations. It is obvious that this place withstood Vegas through the years and all of its glory. I was seated within 10 minutes on a Saturday morning and i'm sure that is an impressive wait time. The service was also divine and the food came out within 5! I am not a huge fan of American diners but this place deserves a spot in my foodie heart. Lobster Eggs Benedict FTW!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was 8 years old and now I'm writing this gem off my last the last 4 times I have had  my order jacked up and this time the waitress even tho she repeated it to me at the beginning still told me the wrong thing is what I ordered just terrible experiences for last few years"}
{"text":"Best omelets we have eaten anywhere. My husband had the kitchen sink,  it had everything in it.  Tasted amazing.  He did the split plate for 99 cents which came with extra spuds. I had the country fried steak omelet,  I recommend to anyone who loves country fried steak like myself.  Prefect amount of eggs to steak. Our meals came with a choice of bread, we both picked pumpkin bread.  It did not disappoint either.  Great food overall. Definitely see ourselves going back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. We passed in a million times and decided finally to give it a try. The first time we stopped by it was already closed ( it closes pretty early, at 3 pm) and we came back. First of all, the food is delicious. I tried their Polish sandwich and it was unbelievable. The service was pretty fast and super friendly. Even though we came 20 minutes before their closure, nobody rushed us out. We enjoyed our meal. The inside is pretty cool, you feel like you are inside an antique store. We live close by so we will definitely come back. This restaurant has existed since 1979 and now I understand why :) . I wish they had a more noticeable sign outside ( it looks closed) , I think they would get even more business which they deserve."}
{"text":"This place was good we were looking for a place that was off the strip.  We had omelets that were big enough for 3 people. The pumpkin bread and the banana nut walnut were excellent. We could have Shared the omelette but we Didn't and we Had more Than enough. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is the go to breakfast spot in Las Vegas! You will not be disappointed in their meals. Its cost effective and you get the most bang for your buck. I enjoy that they clean their condiments tops everynight. Making it feel like home. The only thing is they do it while your eating, reaching over you. Also, when its not busy they talk more to eachother then take your order. Other than that, food is great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots to go to while in Las Vegas.  Do yourself a favor and drive off the strip once and a while and get yourself some good old fashioned breakfast.  Great Omelette's and all other breakfast goodies.   DEFINITELY GET THE BANANA BREAD!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot. Very unique place and friendly service. The type of ppace you want to try everything in the first visit lol"}
{"text":"I have lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and first ate at the Omelet House way back when I arrived.  It still never disappoints and can't be beat.  Their homemade pumpkin bread is the best.  I highly recommend the Flatlanders Special for your breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great place.   Too many choices of omlettes to chose from.  People r friendly and it's affordable.   Food is great too.  And they have a balloon lady for the kids."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time looking at any other breakfast spot.....this is where you'll want to eat. If I had my last meal at The Omelet House, I would die full and happy.  I can easily be described as a food snob. I care about presentation, service, taste, quality of ingredients.... I want it all. I'll pay a high price for great food. Fortunately, that wasn't necessary, here. The portions were enormous, the quality was impeccable, service was on-point, and the price was completely fair.  There were 3 of us, so we ordered a variety and shared. Pancakes.... I never order these. They're just flat cake...why waste the calories? Psh, I'll tell you why... Bc the pancakes at this place are perfectly cooked with a slightly crisp exterior and soft, fluffy inside. I'm better for having eaten them. Corned beef hash....we ordered the side dish. Holy cow.... It was a heaping portion of homemade hash with both small and large pieces of corned beef that they obviously roasted. Hands down the best corned beef hash I've ever had. Turkey Benedict....they obviously roast and slice their own bird. Thick, moist, fresh turkey slices with a sliced roasted tomato, avocado, and homemade hollandaise. The traditional Eggs Benedict doesn't hold a candle to this gem. I think my eyes rolled back in my head after the first bite. Side of potatoes.... These looked like chips. Nope! They are thicker and have a more meaty, potato center. Crisp edges with a perfectly soft center. Whatever they put on these sealed the deal for them bring the best potatoes for breakfast imaginable. Oatmeal.... Call me crazy, but I order oatmeal, often. I love to top my oatmeal with sliced banana, salt, bacon pieces and cream. As the base, the oatmeal is so important and rarely am I blown away by it. The consistency, temperature, and texture was ideal. I don't know if it's this perfect every time, but I suspect so. I don't believe that hitting the bulls eye on every single dish was an accident. These people know food.  Atmosphere..... Okay, so it's in a shopping center and it looks like you're at your grandmother's house. And? Did you come for interior decorating advice? Neither did I. It's clean, the service was fantastic and the food was better than many fine dining establishments.  Go here. You will be glad you did.   Darn.... Only thing I'd change is the coffee. Weak, with a dirty water flavor. With food this good, they need a rich, dark, robust coffee. If I'd had that, my head may have exploded from the experience."}
{"text":"The food is always great, the people are very friendly and Kelly is so sweet.  I always enjoy having breakfast there."}
