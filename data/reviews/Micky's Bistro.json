{"text":"So happy it's close by!This is a jewel lost in Huntersville.   The restaurant is very pleasant, elegant looking although without tablecloths.  It has an outside area with tables and umbrellas in the back (which is really the front of the building since the entrance is in the back).   The hostess was a bit abrupt but the service was outstanding, very attentive.  The food was absolutely delicious!  I had the ribeye, done to my specifications, so tender and had been marinated just right.  The mash potatoes were good but my husband french fries was really tasty.  His Philly steak sandwich was very good.  We had a private party with some friends that worked out really well since they have a private room in the back perfect for about 20 people.  That time we tried the chicken pasta, which was surprisingly good and the salmon, very moist and perfectly done.  I have also tried a quinoa salad and it was great.  We have tried two desserts, the breadpudding is very large and so tasty, best for sharing but will definitely finish it.  The chocolate cake dessert was devoured by my husband.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was edible, nothing to write home about.Strip mall atmosphere, strip mall food.  Nothing stood out as being anything above marginal. I had hoped for something to bring me back. The one thing that drove our experience down was the waiter. Heafty/fat dude that was rude/ condescending at best..not knowledgeble on the menu at all, argumentative about something as simple as house wine that he was sure wasen't offered and was clearly on the menu?? He showed up to take our order and drop off our food and made NO appologies about it. I probably wouldn't of bothered to write anything on a so,so blah restaurant if it weren't for the super crappy experience from the waiter."}
{"text":"This place is great! The seared ahi tuna salad is amazing. There are so many flavors (spiced tuna, olives, artichokes...), you would expect that it wouldn't come together...but it does!  Everything is less than 20 bucks, (even the full rack of ribs) and the self proclaimed \"bar food\" is far better than the sarcastic description would suggest. Pork sliders and Chicken Genovese are my other favs!  Great beer and wine specials!"}
{"text":"Completely average. Everything seemed frozen. The calamari, the crab cake. The French dip was underwhelming as well.   There are so many better options  than Mickys. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We passed this place for years and never gave them a chance based on their location. Everything we've had has been exceptional. Atmospher and price are excellent as well."}
