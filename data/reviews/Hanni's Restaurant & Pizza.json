{"text":"We found Hannis when we moved temporarily imto the area.  What a find!  We know go put of our way to pick up order their two lasagna for 18.95 plus GST.  Its amazing!  Best we have ever had and large portions too! Garlic toast. ..its a special pick up only I think.  There pizza is great too and very friendly service. Family atmosphere. ..casual. . Excellent table service.  Hubby loves a glass of red wine if he just ordered walking in to wait. We're so glad we popped in one time to try them!  Now we're regulars!"}
{"text":"This is such great homemade pizza. They have lots of cheese, thick crust and quite filling. I would highly recommend the hummus too but the pita bread that comes with it is hit if it's fresh or not."}
{"text":"A group of us went here on a whim last night for dinner because we were craving pizza and saw some good reviews. We were very pleased! The best way to describe the restaurant is cozy; nothing fancy.  From what I observed, it is a family-run business and they had many regulars coming and going, either to eat in or take out. Our server was a young, enthusiastic woman. She was very helpful. We had the Hannis Special gourmet pizza with a Greek salad to start. Fabulous! My only negative comment is that the parking lot is very small and we had a hard time finding a spot. Beware that if you try to park in front of the convenience store, you'll get yelled at! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery based on yelp reviews of this place. Service on phone and at the door was very friendly. Food was delicious.  Well above your average pizza place and very affordable. I'll be calling them next time in town."}
{"text":"Hanni's is a favorite of our family. With two growing boys, age 8 and 11, it's not hard to imagine why a place that is family friendly and features generous portions of pasta and pizza would be a hit. My wife and I appreciate that it is locally owned and family run and that those generous portion are, if not cheap, then at least reasonably priced. The meals are all freshly prepared after ordering. This means two things: food is piping hot and tasty fresh and service is slooow! In fact, I don't believe we've ever received our meal in less than half an hour. This is compounded by the fact that Hanni's is always busy. If the wait staff were not so friendly, or the food not so good, this would be a deal breaker for me. But Hanni's is the exception to my slow service rule - every rule has to have at least one, so why not. There is one other aspect of Hanni's that might make you cringe - the decor. I don't lnow why family run joints have look like they were decorated wire garage sale leftovers. Perhaps for some that adds to their charm, but not for me. If you own anything made by Gucci or Prada then just walking through the door might bring on anaphylaxis. Still, it's hard to to beat Hanni's for quality homestyle food. And at the end of the day, that's what my family wants out of an eatery, so Hanni's suits us just fine.."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a year as I moved away from the neighbourhood  but I did go there a lot when I lived there. This place has been around for a long time and has always had great food. The pizza is just the way I like them. Nice edible crust and fresh, plentiful topping. The staff (owners?) are always helpful and friendly. Nice cozy place to take a date. Try the appetizers also they are also very good. Pizza for takeout is great."}
{"text":"If you like Greek food and pizza oh my god this is one of the hidden wonders of Calgary. The portions are very very large and so filling. If you come here you will have fantastic leftovers for the next day. I highly recommend this place to everyone. I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"We had the Hawaiian & Zorba the Greek pizzas and loved them! Loads of cheese and very yummy overall! The crust was even amazing too!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I am a HUGE pizza connoisseur, critic, and snob. I grew up in a city with a long, rich pizza tradition, and have travelled all over the US eating the best of the best. I've also eaten pizza throughout Europe and Italy... I'm very picky about pizza, and can pick out flaws in pies from even the most recommended shops.  Recently we went to Hanni's Restaurant & Pizza (http://www.hannisonline.com) because we had a Living Social voucher. I had never heard of Hanni's before, and to be quite honest we were just expecting \"run of the mill\" Greek-style pie like you find at the older neighborhood pubs and restaurants across Calgary. We ordered the S.M.O.G. pizza (talian sausage, mushrooms, onions, green peppers), and MAN were we surprised - this is OUTSTANDING pizza. HANDS DOWN the best Greek pizza I've had in YYC, and equivalent in quality to the best pies from other genres including Il Centro, Rea's, Tom's, Pizza Bob's, Gondola,Pizza d'Vogglio, etc.  This pie has a crunchy fried rim that somehow [i]isn't[/i] greasy, a thick bold and spicy sauce that is applied VERY liberally (perfect - i usually order extra sauce but they have nailed it), a very meaty italian sausage that reminded me of the meat they used to have on the \"Hoven\" pizza at Rocky Mountain Flatbread Co. in Canmore, and a very thick layer of top-quality cheese. (This cheese is actually STRINGY, something that you don't see in many pies these days as many shops use cost-cutting processed cheese food.)"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place...  Period.  Not exceptionally different.  Not fancy.  Just great ingredients put together skillfully.  My second favorite is una and that's a whole different type of pizza experience.  This is just that comfortable neighborhood pizza store that you love for beer nights and superbowl, the place you go into wearing sweatpants to pick up pizza...  Don't get me wrong it's a cute and quaint place to eat.  It's just that comfortable.  But the pizza has yet to be beat.  And I LOVE pizza.  My favorite order is a double pepperoni with half the pepperoni on top and half under the cheese with extra sauce.  It's not on the menu but I'd appreciate it if you call it the NEIL!  I've had this order at other places and I like it...  But never as much as Hanni's.  The cheese is perfect in amount and quality.  It just tastes wonderful and complement the whole pizza without overpowering.  The pepperoni is exceptional.  The thickness is perfect.  Not so thin that it's like bacon.  Not so thick it feels like a slab of meat.  Again never overpowering.  The sauce as well is just that perfect tartness with even spices and viscosity.  The kind you sop up off the plate after dripping!  The crust is always perfect.  And on occasion I've had this pizza multiple times a week...  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So I'm not going to argue, the fact is Hannis has the best Baked Tortellini Alfredo and Pizzas in South Calgary.  So why only the 3 stars? Well, for starters My family has been ordering delivery every other Friday since 2004. The guy who drops off our food is the sweetest and nicest guy you'll ever meet, he will go the extra mile for you. But it's another story if going to the restaurant;  1. You MUST wait to be seated or else they get mad 2. The owners favour certain people... even if you get there before others they don't bring your food with first come, first serve theory.  3. They offer no Gluten Free products (get with it already)! 4. The owners daughter is arrogant and obnoxious... she always has a chip on her shoulder and will \"help you when she's ready...\" 5. The seating arrangement needs to be feng shue'd (serious) 6. The wash rooms are grimy and need to be cleaned 7. If Hannis screws up your order they will make you pay for it (without apologizing) or offering a complimentary option like; taking the dish off the bil 8. Sometime they will send you away... tables are empty but they claim it's all Reserved... I doubt them at times (that was my last straw).  I don't eat there anymore because I don't feel valued HANNIS JUST LOST MY FAMILY OF 20 LOYAL CUSTOMERS..."}
{"text":"A nice little local Italian restaurant, if you like pizza.  My friend recommended this place to me, but he had only ever had the pizza. I think that's the reason I had to disagree with the quality of the food. I expect an Italian restaurant to serve a good pasta dish, but the spaghetti I was served was really poor in quality. The sauce was quite bland and the spaghetti was over cooked. Not to mention the cost for such a small portion. Service was good though and the staff was friendly.  Try the pizza, but it's probably not worth getting anything else."}
{"text":"We've been to Hanni's many times. It isn't fancy or imaginative but the portions are huge, prices are fair and food is delicious. You always know exactly what you are going to get; well made food that is what the menu says it's going to be.  Hanni's is a great place when your tired, don't want to cook but want some comforting pasta or pizza.  It's a family favourite."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not fancy, however the service is absolutely amazing and the food is so delicious! Their pastas are reasonably priced, and you get quite the bang for your buck. I would highly recommend this restaurant for absolutely anyone."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great.  Prices were fair and the portions generous."}
