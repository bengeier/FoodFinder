{"text":"Melissa was JW's manager running the restaurant at the time. Melissa was terminated due to fraud, theft of money, food and equipment. I can see why she would  like to badmouth JW's. She told me  that once a felon always a felon. Due to her actions JW's has been sold and is under new management..."}
{"text":"Business no longer exists.  Phone number belongs to another company."}
{"text":"Do not know what happened to this place it was good one time but I do not know what the hell happened. Been there several times past and we will not be going back. When to order ,an example ,rye bread they were out, chicken fried steak overcooked. And on and on.  Again I say I do not want to know what happened here."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!   Looks like a great hole in the wall but my scrambled eggs were burnt..my sausage was raw and the waitress never said anything when I told her to take it away other than to offer me a box..service was barely mediocre and the kitchen clearly had no idea what they are doing..and to top it all off instead of compensating for bad food the waitress charged $8 too much on the final bill...as I said DONOT GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little breakfast place. It's now called Mike's Cafe but it is virtually the same place. I love supporting local businesses over chains so I go here for my weekend brunches."}
{"text":"New owner......Now called Mikes..... Breakfast was WONDERFUL!! Home fries.... perfect, veggie omelet....really good, pancakes.....yummy!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is known as Mike's Wright in the corner.  The present employees were not aware it had ever been called JW's or the discrepancy on Yelp and Foursquare.   Food was very good. No complaints from my party of six. Gravy is scratch and very good.  I recommend."}
