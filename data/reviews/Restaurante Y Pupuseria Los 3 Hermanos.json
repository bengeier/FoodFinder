{"text":"One of our new favorites. We had frijol and chicharron pupusas and the carne guisada. Everything was fresh and delicious. The simple, but hearty corn tortillas and homemade chips and beans are a highlight. Really good service in a nice setting. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So I would like to start off by saying this place is a hole in the wall. Its small and home feeling. Now to get to the good part, the food. My husband and I had pupusas revueltas (beef, cheese and beans), yucca frita (which is accompanied by fried pork and cabbage salad) and beef empanadas. Everything was delicious! The pupusas had really good flavor and the cabbage topping wasnt too tart, the vinegar flavor didnt over power it. The yucca frita was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Same with the fried pork, crispy outside and juicy inside. The empanadas were fantastic!  They were filled perfectly with beef and were delicious like everything we had. The drinks were amazing too! The ensalada de fruta which is pinapple juice with tiny chopped apple bits was refreshing! So if you're in the mood for some good tasty Salvadoran food i definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The pupusas were amazing! I also ordered some horchata and yucca frita. I am glad I tried this place out and will definitely go back. Seating is minimal but I went on a Sunday afternoon and was able to sit down and enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here. I had the pupusas and pastelitos. I had an horchata and my husband had an agua de tamarindo and you can tell it was made fresh! However the service was bad. Slow service and they were very unprofessional, arguing over whose turn it was to wait on us. Apparently no one wanted to work that day. I've had better service and food at other salvadoreña restaurants. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. I had yuca and pupusas (revueltas). The pupusas are on the thinner side but relatively average size, filling is nicely distributed so it's not too doughy. Be warned the curtido is spicy, but good. The yuca and chicharrón was very good too! Nice and crunchy :) The staff was very nice and the restaurant was nice and clean! Definitely looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner since discovering it. Amazing food, kind and friendly service. Small mom and pop type location. It's like a different, better twist on Mexican food. Food is more flavorful, less spicy, but worry not... Plenty of Tapatio to go around if you need more kick. The horchata is the best I've ever had. Plantains are delicious! Don't hesitate to come here for something different!"}
