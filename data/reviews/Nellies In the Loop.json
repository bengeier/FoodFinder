{"text":"This is my favorite Nellies location in Calgary by far. It is not located directly downtown and is therefore usually less crowded and very clean. The atmosphere is slightly more contemporary then other Nellies although still very comfortable and casual. I usually go for the bennies and have never been dissapointed. The food is typical breakfast/brunch and about the quality you'd expect for the price. Maybe not gourmet (closer to diner style), but deffinitely quality comfort food. Service is very casual yet attentive. My coffee cup never runs dry! For the best experience try to avoid peak hours."}
{"text":"Over rated by far, disorganized at best. Prices are too high for the lack of quality. Head to Moxies for a much better breakfast or lunch for a better price. Also the Freedom Fries incident still upsets me, strange how they changed their minds on that one!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recent trip to Calgary and had very high hopes. I used to be a big fan of Nellie's on 17th Ave (though I just found out about their health violation business. Eeps!) and I also adore Marda Loop.

Overall it really wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that great either. The cherries for my stuffed French toast were just cherry pie filling from a can, which while delicious at first, is just way too much and too rich. I was also astounded at the fact that my side of bacon cost almost $4 and I only got 3 sad looking pieces.

I really do enjoy the space and location though. It's clean, bright, well laid out and all the serving staff were quite friendly. Plus, you can't go wrong hanging out in Marda Loop."}
{"text":"Good food, though prices are a bit high.  Get there early if you don't want to wait in line.  Had good service each time I've been there."}
{"text":"Being a huge lover of every other Nellies in the city, I thought I'd give the Marda Loop one a try.  I was in the neighborhood one afternoon and I was craving some good ol' Nellies breakfast.

I was disappointed after my breakfast there.  I was unbelievably happy to see that this particular Nellies location offered Veggie Benny's; I've yet to see these at any other one.  They were not good.  There was something about them that tasted sour and I couldn't bring myself to finish the meal... that's unusual for me at breakfast-time.  

What I also couldn't bring myself do was complain about them.  I didn't feel that my waitress was too impressed with me being there as it was (maybe it's because I brought my laptop and book and ate alone) so I definitely didn't think she'd take food criticism too lightly.  I'll be honest, I was a little scared.

I did like the set-up of the place, but the service and icky food definitely wrecked that.  Oh yeah, and the prices are a little high for what it is.  Maybe it's because it's in Marda Loop.  I don't know about that, but I do know I don't like the place much."}
