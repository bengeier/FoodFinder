{"text":"Went here for lunch.  We were seated quickly, ordered quickly, and received our food surprisingly fast (which is not necessarily a good thing).  With that being said, the food itself tasted good enough (I ordered one of the pork/rice plates).  For taste, service, and value, I probably would have rated it higher, however, my appetite was somewhat ruined by the extremely unclean cutlery they presented to us.  There were visible stains on the forks that I could wipe off with just a simple wipe from a napkin, which leads me to question exactly what their cleaning procedures are."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Markham. Bbq chicken and beef are so good that I couldn't find another to compare in my own experience.  I visit there often and I am still happy since first visit."}
{"text":"Small size was much larger than you would expect. Chill atmosphere and the waiters watch everyone like a hawk (which is good because if you ever need anything just raise your hand.)"}
{"text":"This is not at all authentic Viet - it is Cantonese run and is cooked with a distinct Canto style.  

And it's great.

This was my favorite Pho place for a very long time...i used to go weekly.  Having said that I've taken lots of friends here and they're not as addicted to it like I am, so maybe it's just me.

It's run by the guy who used to run Kim Po a bunch of years ago

Everything I've had here is great."}
{"text":"I've been back here, since it was my favorite pho place, and something has changed. The broth is very watery, and there's no flavor in it anymore. I'm wondering if the chef has changed, but overall, now it just tastes like beef watered down soup."}
{"text":"Consistent flavor profiles. Soup for the most part is flavorful and you can ask for extra noodles for free. Service is okay. Would recommend to a friend. Have been here more than 50 times in the last 5 years."}
{"text":"Stopped by FMP on a Saturday night for a late dinner and was glad to find somewhere open. 
The wait staff was pleasant, and there was one that stood out as particularly friendly and accommodating. 

I ordered curry and my friend ordered the lemongrass & BBQ chicken rice. The curry was watered down and did not have much flavour other than the spice. It was decent, as you can't mess up curry, but I've definitely had better. On the other hand, my company enjoyed the BBQ chicken.

Saw a few nice desserts and drinks on the menu, perhaps I'll be back to try some of those. The prices are decent and reasonable too. But don't expect too much, there isn't anything special about the food and the interior isn't much. Come here for some decent priced food if you don't mind occasionally swapping at flies around your food."}
{"text":"The family comes here often because we're all too indecisive in choosing restaurants. After walking around looking at all the various restaurants, we decided to just stick with one we've been to before (wow, so adventurous).

The meals here are always decent. Nothing especially amazing, but we've never experienced something horrific either!

What we ordered:
BBQ beef crepe  - wasn't all that great, the fillings were a bit bland. The rice wrapper was also quite...chewy?
Flank brisket & beef tendon rice noodle soup - this was alright. A bit lacking in the meat, but my brother enjoys the soup and I like stealing bean sprouts from everyone!
Steamed seasonal vegetable with oyster sauce - really soft, and fell apart easily with minimal chewing! The oyster sauce was horribly salty. though.
Pan-fried pompanos with papayas - Haha, this confused us because we thought \"papaya\" meant that reddish fruit thing, but this papaya was an entirely different kind of...vegetable? (I guess.) The fish was pretty good, but the fish bones were pretty annoying to eat around (I think I swallowed most of mine).

Overall, decent."}
{"text":"I have been here three times in total over the last six months. I initially came here as a recommendation and enjoyed my visit all three times. I can't completely agree with the other reviews because I haven't tried their pho. Every time I have managed to order the same thing: BBQ chicken on vermicelli with spring rolls and minced shrimp on sugar cane yum! The chicken is always tender and the spring rolls are consistent. Sometimes we'll even order the BBQ oysters, for $3 each you get one great baked oyster with caramelized onions and garlic, even more yum.
When it comes to service I believe they do very well compared to other pho places. I do hold Asian restaurants and westernized restaurants at different levels of expectations, which is not to be racist in anyway because I've been at both ends. VIP just seems more attentive than most pho places. 
My last visit was on a Tuesday lunch. The restaurant was full but was still able to accommodate us, and didn't give us a hard time for moving tables. 
I will definitely return when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"So the pho here is probably not authentic, and it's run by Chinese people, not Vietnamese people. 

I'm not sure what real, 100% authentic pho tastes like, I just know I love their pho.

Good amount of veggies, super sodium OD level soup, and they are one of the few Viet places that will serve the young coconut whole (not some lame juice drink in a glass with chunks of coconut in it). 

Definitely my go-to place in Markham"}
{"text":"I feel that this has gone downhill compared to 2 years ago.

Since my previous visit, they've introduced daily lunch special (~$9) from noon to 5pm.

We order 2 Pho Tai (Rare beef) and 1 Rice with Lemongrass BBQ pork.

The Lemongrass BBQ pork was terrible! It tasted like boiled pork with with just a bit of pink coloring on the side to make it look like Char Siu. The only good part, I guess, is that they were generous and gave 2 T-bone pork chops. Best part of this dish was the rice in fish sauce.

As for the bowls of pho, I like that they were generous on the meat, and the rare beef is not dried cuts like in Ottawa. The rice noodles tasted \"fresh\" (as opposed to the dried dehydrated ones you boil at home) and a slight bit oily, to help prevent them sticking. The soup broth was nothing special."}
{"text":"Decent enough place, I'm pretty sure it's one of the only viet places in the plaza so it will do the job whether you are feeling pho or bun. They have some lunch specials but I think they only apply for weekdays...

Service like others have said is efficient and friendly so kudos to them, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the food is just A-OK. 

Got the Grilled Chicken Bun. My eating buddies got the pho which were sized well for the price, they didn't have any complaints =)."}
{"text":"Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 7/10 
Service: 8/10
Overall experience: 8/10

This has been my family's go-to Vietnamese place for many, many years. Though some prefer Pho 88 and the multiple others you can find in the Markham area, we always gravitated towards this one!

Pho is really good. Always piping hot and comes out quickly. Their cold appetizer platter is great to share if you're with a large group. Curries and lemongrass dishes are also staples on the menu. 

Service is good and quick. Though it is a fairly sizeable restaurant, they are always well staffed so you're never waiting a long time for anything. Decor is fine.

THE BOTTOM LINE: great staple for Vietnamese cuisine in the Markham area."}
{"text":"This place has the tastiest pho I have had in Markham or Toronto.  It isn't suthentic, but it tastes great.  I don't get the other dishes so I can't say much except this is my favorite pho...and I have tried dozens of bowls from many restaurants."}
{"text":"Bought 2 special noodle soup and a few appetizers for pick up tonight. Got home and got the food ready for dinner. I've picked up many Pho's for dinner from many different places but this place is by far the worst. The most important part of Pho's are the soup and i cannot taste the vitnamese noodle flavor. It was more like boiled hot water with salt. Very disappointed and will never waste my money there again."}
{"text":"This is a first for me, but I've to been this restaurant before, and it was so bad that I completely repressed the memory of being here.  But I've realized this too late, as it only came to me after I ordered the food.  

After catching probably the worst cinematic rendition of my favourite tragedy; The Great Gatsby, my friend Harry and I decided to grab something some eat.  We hopped into my truck, and drove exactly 100metres, circling the First Markham Place in a true display of laziness.  The restaurant was literally a stone's throw away, and the fact that my vehicle was a gas guzzling beast was the icing on the cake...or the cherry on the icing..or whatever it's a thing.

The booth we sat in was the only authentic thing about this Vietnamese restaurant, as a corpulent person could never dream of fitting in here.  I was brought immediately to the table's edge, which meant each time I was to lean inwards slight for the food, I would be at risk of gay kissing Harry if he was to perform the same action.
This could be a good thing if Harry was Harriet, and I was that cunning. 
I got the curry goat, which I highly suspected it being lamb, and Harry got a bowl of beef pho.  I asked the waiter what the 'shredded pork crepe was', he must have lied to me because I ended up getting it, and only to find out it was just a Vietnamese spring roll with the pork instead of the shrimp.  Was pork so unseasonal that it cannot be associated with the word spring?  I was euchred!
The meal was unsatisfying, Harry complained about his broth tasting too strongly of MSGs, and we were so closely situated with one another, we kept accidentally playing games of footsies.  
My friend Lucy joked the evening before about me going to the movies with a guy friend with not-so-subtle insinuations, I strongly believe she has cursed us by doing this, and perhaps this is proof that she is a practicing witch...and her craft involved conjuring queer moments between straight men, the darkest of all magics. 

I do have to admit, the lazy decor did remind me of a few very shabby restaurants I visited while in Vietnam, however those restaurants produced some of the best food I've ever had.  VIP Vietnamese Cuisine's culinary productions were so far off from anything authentic, I cannot help to re-repress this experience.  It's like that movie, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  I found my way to a place where I forced myself to forget, only to rediscover it in a most foul way. 
Why is it even called VIP?  There's not a single pole for dancing anywhere!

VIP Vietnamese Cuisine. OMG..this is is abbreviated as V.V.C...like Very VC!!
Most foul!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and generally it's good, I always get the pho house special. I wish they would add more tripe and more meat and less noodles. I've had other things too, generally everything is good. pho price is cheap as well."}
{"text":"Update:

The portion size and plating for the same thing seems to be different every time I am here. I always get the Vermicelli with Shrimp in Sugar cane, pork and spring roll. Everytime I am here the plate is different the amount of everything is different. Even the Vermicelli is different. Sometimes it's the really thin one and sometimes it's the normal one. Just a note!"}
{"text":"Favourite place to come here when I'm eating out with my family. 
I've been coming to VIP for most of my life and the Pho here is my absolute favourite. It's my comfort food just like other Asian foods. Service is amazing when I'm there and of course the food is also! Awesome place to eat!"}
{"text":"Was starving one late night and decide to get some food and ended up at First Markham Place - most of the places were closed but VIP Vietnamese Restaurant.  So we decided to check this place out, it was alomost half full at that time.  We ordered the Pho, spring rolls and Bun, they wren't that good.  The beef to noodle ratio was okay and the beef itself was hard.  The soup base is decent but I had better.  I don't know if it is because it is so late in the day the quality was bad as this is my first time here but it might also be my last.   The decor is pretty nice here but it was from the pass resturant located here and they just changed it up a bit.

{"text":"not authentic Vietnamese food?not even rice vermicelli?terrible food?worse service?not recommended"}
{"text":"It was a quick lunch, and I ordered the Wednesday special with the tom yum goong soup base noodles with vietnamese spring rolls.  It was for only $8.50 plus tax, and the service was really fast.  It was less than ten minutes of way.  The soup was not spicy enough for my taste though and it was not deeply flavoured enough.  It was an okay dish for lunch and the servers really have no expression on their face.  Otherwise, not a bad place to get a quick bite."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the average rating, the good ratings are from years ago. Was late night and was hungry so we settled for this 3.5 rating which was a lie. It should be around 2.

I ordered the large pho thinking I would not be able to finish it because I usually can't even finish a small and I just ate not too long ago.


I could not believe it, it had a 95% noodle and 5% meat. I had to dig deep to find every piece of beef and I was still hungry! Never happened at a pho place before. Just cannot get past that, they try to be cheap and don't realize they are losing customers."}
{"text":"\"Wanna go for Viet food?\" My answer will pretty much ALWAYS be \"Nah\"... But somehow I ended up here for lunch today! Lol. 

My brother is a pretty regular customer here, and even has a discount card (for 10%), but I can only recall ever being here once before!  However, I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the lunch specials. 2 big pork chops with a bowl of rice and a lemon tea for $7.99? Hellz yea! I mean, the lemon tea ended up a lime tea that was over-sweet, but I guess I can just ask for less sugar next time.

Relatively large space considering the average size of the restaurants in First Markham Place and has free wifi. Even though I was okay with my meal today, I probably won't be back here anytime soon. Nothing against the restaurant itself, just not my preference in cuisine!"}
{"text":"This weekend I found myself randomly in Markham and waiting to eat something different for a change. Since I was not used to the area, we decided to go to the restaurant with the most people sitting inside (I know great way to finding good food :P). Anyway, the presentation of the restaurant was not that great (it kindly looks like a old warehouse which has been converted to a restaurant) but   the price was amazing and the food was great. The service was ok, since I felt our servicer spoke limited English, but he did his best to explain things to us. For a place we randomly choose to  eat at, we were pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I have not figured out why there is a lineup to this place.

The foods are not outrageously delicious nor the design, wowing. The staffs are not fantastically friendly, or the menu distinctive in any special way.

It's a Chinese run Restaurant with some Vietnamese dishes.

The Bun (vermicelli with grilled chicken and spring rolls) was average but in no way competitive in taste or price of \"Pho Mi 99\" (in Vaughan). The Pho was bland and definitely could use a few days in the kitchen with the cooks from \"Pho Vietnam\" (Scarborough), and lastly, the Com (rice with grilled chicken and a piece of cha) is plainly alright.    

I expected better.

Overall rating based on food alone (4.5/10)"}
{"text":"Pretty good daily lunch specials. Had a spicy beef noodle soup that was sort of a tom yum base with spring rolls on the side. $7.50. Service was friendly and efficient. 

It wasn't the best ice ever had, but it was tasty, filling, inexpensive and very fast, which is all I need in a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"My bf and I had lunch today and tried their hainanese chicken for the first time and it was amazing! They called it the Vietnamese style hainanese chicken.  The portion was gigantic and the chicken was moist and flavorful.  The rice had chicken fat mixed in and it tasted just the way it should.  We also had the lemongrass pork and chicken rice & beef wrap which are always good."}
{"text":"Truth be told, we only ended up here because we were in a rush and didnt want to wait. Most of the restaurants had line- ups-out-the -door. It was afterall, a busy Friday night. 

This place wasn't my first choice, but luckily I was not disappointed with our order:

1. The curry chicken glass noodles was spicy...definite heat! (No pic taken)
2. The appetizer platter was not my selection but was great because there was something for everyone. 

My favourite appetizer on the platter was the grilled pork on a shrimp chip (please refer to picture below).

I totally recommend getting it! 

I'm sure this is served at other Vietnamese restaurants, but this is the first time I've had it....It won't be the last!"}
{"text":"usually, when I visit a Viet place, I order pho. It is awesome for cold nights and taste fantastic. The family also loves it. As I said before, its all about the soup base (as long as the ingredients are fresh). This location was ok with regards to the soup base. It wasn't the best and by far, it wasn't the worst. Usually, everyone finishes the soup base because it is just that good. But we didn't finish the soup this time around. I can only tell you that it wasn't amazing and not everyone was into finishing the soup. 

This time, I ordered the beef brisket curry with \"pancakes\". It was just a roti with curry. I also ordered the viet bread on the side. Overall, it was a very good dish. Wasn't too spicy, everyone loved it, and the roti wouldn't cover your hands in oil. They even cut the roti so that you didn't see everyone's hands all over it ripping it apart (other locations just give you the whole roti and you have to watch as everyone touches it and rips it apart). 

Service wasn't good, but wasn't bad. It was a traditional Viet restaurant where you had to call the server to you. Price was ok too. For a party of 4 and 2 kids, it was approximately $70.

It was a fun experience, but I had to doc one star because of the soup base. It just wasn't up to par with what I had at other locations. 

Pro

Good curry (with beef brisket)
Good Roti
Good bread

Con

Not the best soup (but not bad)"}
{"text":"I went with a couple of people just the past week.  We ordered the typical pho in large size and spring rolls.  Portions were okay except the soup stock (the esscence of pho) was pretty much water down fish sauce.  It's really lacking the beef or chicken stock taste.  Spring rolls had very little meat in there.  Overall it was a big disappointment.  It really explains why the there were only 3 to 5 tables of clients at busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. The serving sizes were very large, and the service was good. We got the pho with rare beef and beef balls, the stir-fried lemongrass chicken with rice, and the beef fried rice. All of the dishes were decent, but the lemongrass chicken dish didn't have the usual lemongrass taste. It was still good, and just had an unexpected flavour."}
{"text":"Where is all the meat! That was something I kept thinking throughout my meal at VIP. 

I came here recently for dinner with a friend on a weeknight. The restaurant was fairly quiet. VIP is located in the First Markham Place plaza among the stiff competition of many other Asian restaurants. I ordered a large rare beef and tripe pho; my friend and I also decided to share an order of Vietnamese spring rolls. The spring rolls were not great, the filling was barely identifiable and lacked any flavour; their only redeeming quality was that they were crispy and not oily. My large pho was modest in size; this soup would be a medium in most other places. My soup was seriously lacking meat and consisted mostly of tripe and lots of noodles. The beef was not rare enough and was mostly cooked through by the time it reached my table. The flavour of the soup wasn't spectacular, far from the best pho I have had. I also managed to snag one of my friends fried shrimp on sugar cane, the breading on the shrimp was not crispy at all, overall just meh. 

The restaurant itself is pretty run down, and cleanliness does not seem to be a top priority. I usually don't mind a run down place as long as the food is good; however that is not the case with this establishment. The service was non-existent, our order was taken and food was brought to us in a timely manner; nothing more and nothing less. Overall I do not think I will return to VIP any time soon. 

*They do have a lobster tank, but the only lobster in there did not look especially alive."}
{"text":"I end up at VIP every few months when I find myself at First Markham Place with friends and we get a craving for Vietnamese food. The food at VIP isn't too amazing (as expected, since it is a Chinese-owned Vietnamese restaurant) but it is far from terrible and does the trick. 

I usually get the house special pho, which comes fully loaded with brisket, tripe, beef balls, etc. Nothing special, but there are definitely worse places to get pho in Markham. All of their prices have gone up recently, so I won't be going out of my way to eat here since the quality doesn't warrant a price increase. The milkshakes have gone up to $4 or $4.50 which is past my psychological barrier for a non-alcoholic drink. I like their durian shake, but for more than $4, I'll pass. 

The restaurant itself is pretty spacious for a pho place and has good seating for small groups. It's been a while since I used the washroom, but I don't remember it being too gross...but it wasn't nice either."}
{"text":"See the picture that goes along with this review? Looks good, doesn't it? Haha...you've been fooled. That was the dish I ordered most recently because their pho had gone completely downhill from when I used to visit this place frequently many years ago. They started cutting back on so many ingredients, it essentially became 95% noodle + bean sprouts and 5% meat. At those odds, I'm better off eating a McDonald's \"100% beef\" patty.  

This rice noodle dish had 3 meat components and none of them tasted completely natural. The chicken was probably the best, as it was actually the texture of chicken and tasted like there was some real flavour in it.  There was a slab of beef wrapped around slices of raw onion. Yes, just raw onion with no real seasoning or cooking. It was so tough, I couldn't tell if the beef was real meat or MSG-flavoured carpet. There were also chunks of beef (?) wrapped in seaweed. Not sure if it was beef because all you could taste was a weird sweetness. The seaweed was soggy. 

What was good about this dish? Well the carrots, peanuts, and chives were pretty good. Not because they had any special flavour, it's just that they tasted like what they're supposed to be. 

Funny story, when my friend asked for \"a table for three\", the lady thought he said \"a table for free\" and promptly told him to get out. Throughout dinner, I'm pretty sure she was watching us in case we actually had no money and bailed. This wasn't relevant to my rating as service at Chinese-run restaurants is kind of...special. Rule of thumb: if they don't argue with you on anything, you're in the clear!

{"text":"Came here on a Friday freezing night and my friend who came back after a year of working and school in different continents around the world wanted to grab some food here!

We were seated immediately - there were plenty of spots, and we decided to spend a little more time speaking and deciding what we should get, if we should share etc. We discussed how expensive the food was here (generally, every place increased their meal prices), but we needed to pay around $7 for pho now, and a meal was $10. After a while, the tables were still half empty, a waitress came up to us and rushed us to order our meal. She stated that the table after us already made their order and said we were taking forever to make up our mind. We reluctantly ordered the curry chicken with rice, a bowl of spicy pho (my friend's order), and we asked for the vermicelli wrap.

The food was okay, the curry was decent and the pho was spicy, but not over the top, I would still give it a three star. The vermicelli wrap came and there was just the ingredients and not the rice paper. We asked the waitress, and she started stating that like 8 sheets of rice paper is an additional $8 (I hope someone can clarify that this isn't the case, a whole EXTRA $8)? We still talked throughout the meal and thankfully she left by the time we asked for the bill.

The food is alright and decent here, but it definitely grew a lot more expensive than before and with that kind of service, I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Contrary to many other pho places, the ordering is not checklist style; the wait staff takes your orders. Service is quick and efficient, but not necessarily friendly. When they got my order wrong last night, they were very quick in fixing it, but seemed visibly annoyed that I had already started to eat a bit of it (I was blinded by hunger and started to eat before I realized something was off). 

Food is just okay imo; the portions are large, considering the price, but flavours and execution were just alright. I had the vermicelli with bbq beef and spring rolls. The vermicelli they use is the thick kind -in fact, everything in the bowl was very thick cut. I prefer the pickled carrots and daikon to be finely shredded, rather than the thick slabs VIP serves (it's too sour like this). The spring rolls, while crispy, had a very dry filling. 

Food itself gets 2 stars from me, but +1 for the speedy service."}
{"text":"i had their hoi nan chicken rice and when i saw that they had mango sticky rice I got that as well. the Hoi Nan Chicken Rice was good, chicken was dense and juicy. The gave so much scallion onion oil to pair with the rice. 

I was so disappointed with the mango sticky rice. I was served with a small ball of sticky rice then they had mango puree just poured on top of the whole plate. They didn't even have a slice of fresh mango! This dish they charged me $5.99, it's ridiculous! I can make that and it's not good even cost me $2.00."}
{"text":"This is NOT Vietnamese food. They can say that but they KNOW they're disgracing the title. I've never seen so much MSG in one single dish of pho. I can probably make a meaner bowl of pho than these not-Vietnamese people *inserts Kermit drinking tea meme* 

I feel like every resident of Markham has eaten at this place because that's where we go for 'pho' and honestly I end up here every few months when I don't feel like going to the better places in scarbs. At least this place is never really packed and service is quick. 

The pho falls short of my standards of pho. The noodles are not pho noodles. The satay beef noodles use ho fun, so I absolutely cannot comment on that and I'll just insert the Kermit meme again here. (Google it if you don't know what I'm talking about) The beef is hard and I usually end up pushing it all to the side, and the soup is saltier than my personality. On a hungry day, I really don't care and will devour the MSG like its my job, but usually I try not to go here. I sometimes get the bun, which is not too bad. It's just average so there's nothing more to say about it. 

Generally it's not the worst pho place but if you're coming here to experience the true Vietnam sensation, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"It's kind of difficult to review a place when they gave you the wrong order but from what I gathered this isn't entirely authentic vietnamese food. It isn't terrible but I certainly cannot recommend coming here when there's far better Vietnamese options close by. 

I ordered Vermicelli F5 which was with grilled chicken and spring rolls. My friend ordered for me and we're pretty sure he said the correct letter and number but a rice platter came and they refused to do anything about it. They said it's H5 and that's what they heard. Well we didn't do much about it because I was hungry and left it at that but this is pretty unacceptable. 

Food wise, it was rather subpar. The bbq chicken was not the variety you would get at many other vietnamese establishments and was oddly red in colour. The portion size could have also been better as it was a pretty small cut of chicken. The other item that came with it, I am not entirely sure what it is: I've never seen anything quite like it. It's ground pork inside with an egg roll around it. It's interesting in texture as you can definitely taste the vermicelli but it was quite dry."}
{"text":"Portions were generous and the food was good! Service was decent, as were the prices on the menu. VIP is my go-to Vietnamese restaurant whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Would give this restaurant a 3.5 star rating...the food and prices are great but I'm not so fond of the cleanliness of the place. The place had a weird smell...I'm not sure if it was fish sauce that they served or something else. It bothered me a little as I was eating. Love their thin vermicelli dishes. You can substitute the type of meats - free of charge. Service is good and the staff are nice. Their food is tasty and abundant. I especially liked their spring rolls and  minced fish meat sugar cane."}
{"text":"Very tasty. The noodles are thick and chewy. One of the top 3 satay that I have tried in Toronto Vietnamese restaurants. I would recommend this place to everyone. You might think this place needs renovation or you might be concerned like some reviewers about cleanliness, but I think it's not bad at all compared to most of the Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto. Try it out guys."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go grab some lunch. The menu is fairly priced and the food quality is pretty good. They do offer different menu items than your typical Vietnamese restaurants but nothing really stood out. If you're looking to get a quick meal this is the place to be.

P.S. For vermicelli fans, they use the thick noodles instead of the regular noodles. Personally not a fan but personal perference."}
{"text":"It wasn't as bad nor as expensive as i remembered from the first time i came here.

Had the small bowl of rare beef pho. It had a fair amount of slices, i'd say five slices. It was rare enough; i hate it when places say it's rare and it comes out all cooked. This place wasn't rare very rate, but good enough. For 5.99, it's a decent amount. The large is 6.99 but I'd say it's just more noodles.

The staff leave you alone. Food comes quick. Wouldn't classify it as \"authentic\" though. I'd only go if others wanted to go."}
{"text":"It's really really hard to find good pho in the Markham/Scarborough/Richmond Hill area. Seriously, I have been to some crappy places. Hands down, at least in my modest search for good pho up here, this is the best pho north of Toronto. Flavourful soup, fresh noodles and beef...what more could you want? 

I can't speak to the rest of the food, but if you're looking for good, quality pho north of Toronto....look no further than VIP Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Ok, after coming back to this place I now can say I'll never come back here.  I first have to give everyone the disclaimer that I still do think their fresh shrimp rolls are really good.  So if you're going to this place only for that, go right ahead.  If you are going for anything else, keep reading.

So I ordered a basic special pho and my wife ordered BBQ Pork bun.  When it came out and I tasted the broth it tasted really sweet, kinda had a weird MSG favour to it.  It was also very dark.  The ingredients in the pho were alright I guess, they were pretty good, but the broth kind of killed the whole bowl.

The bun was absolutely terrible.  I don't know how they could have called it bun.  It tasted like spaghetti with candied pork and a bit of vegetables.  Not only that it was oily as hell,  I couldn't even help finish it at the end because the oil was so unpleasant.

If you look at the rest of the menu you can definitely tell that this place is totally influenced by chinese cuisine as there are sections that are just plain chinese noodles (ie. wonton noodle soup).

So, alas, this is probably the last time I'm ever going to go here.  If you want viet food, go to a viet restaurant, if you want chinese noodles go next door."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews, I keep thinking ...maybe I just got very lucky?

I thought the food was pretty damn good. Not the best for sure, but still above average. My wife and I were wandering around Markham and we randomly came to this place ('cause we were lost). We were both hungry and couldn't find a Harvey's (their poutine is ambrosia!). Finally chose this place, because the name made us laugh. 

We both go the vegetable soup to start, and it was really good. Like it filled my soul with warmth good ...could be the MSGs. Either way, both my wife and I were really looking forward to the main dish after the soup! I got the vermicelli noodles and my wife got BBQ pork with rice. My vermicelli bowl was a 5.5/10. Maybe I've been spoiled by PHO Mi 99, but everything about my main dish yelled ...meh. My wife's food was pretty good. Having a petite wife has its advantages (I get to eat her food!), the BBQ pork was a solid 7.5/10. We both figured I had just gotten unlucky with my choice of main. 

The setup of VIP was pretty standard: booths all around with tables+chairs in the middle. We went on a Saturday afternoon, so there wasn't much rush, BUT it was the only place that had any customers at all. The price was also very reasonable, at about ~$6-$8/dish.

My wife and I plan on coming back, so maybe we'll see what all the fuss is about, but we definitely enjoyed it enough to come back. 

TL;DR: Awesome soul-filling vegetable soup. The menu is hit n' miss, get adventurous and try stuff! Will return and re-Yelp =)"}
{"text":"My favourite \" go to\" restaurant.  Flavour fir the Pho is excellent.  The curry with fish balls as rice is very tasty and the H3, rice with bbq chicken and pork is great.  All these dishes are under $10.  The service is good and the staff friendly.  There is no false advertising.  If you want a satisfying, delicious meal, this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Went here today for some take out. Ordered Vietnamese spring rolls and a rice dish (grilled pork and chicken). Paid $16+ which is a little high compared to pho99 in Mississauga. Service was quick 

Taste wise though, the meat was very dry. The spring rolls weren't that great either. 

Will not be back"}
{"text":"Order the pho with brisket. From my past experiences - ordering the brisket can be a hit or miss. Usually it is extremely fatty. I like it lean. Thankfully their meat was lean. The broth was super flavourful and the service was spot on. 

It was rather busy busy we received the food fast and there were no complaints!"}
{"text":"I like the pho here. Big portion size. I can barely finish the small, and if you upsize for $1 the bowl is a lot bigger. You also can't really go wrong with Pho.   I also never have to worry about not having space. The service was alright - mix of super friendly and rude."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp, not too sure why it has such a low rating. I've been to plenty of pho places this is definitely one of the better ones. Soup was really good, large portion and reasonably priced but the atmosphere could be better. A bit hard to find it's located outside of the mall near the banquet hall, look for a green sign with pink writing."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great pho!  Might not be the most authentic, but very tasty broth. This place has other good vietnamese dishes too.  Good prices."}
{"text":"Due to all the poor comments about the pho I decided to go for something different.

Curry chicken with flat bread $13.50 - It came in a large pot and with tons of chicken meat. Mostly dark meat too which is what I prefer. The curry sauce has a hint of sweet and not overly spicy. The sauce was very liquidy and was almost like a soup. It tasted great and I could have drank it like a soup it was so good. What I did instead was order a bowl of rice for $1.50 and utilized a lot of the curry sauce there. The flat bread was light and flaky and went well with the curry sauce.

Vermicelli with grilled pork and spring roll $8.99 - Very large portions. The spring roll was average. The grilled pork had a nice sweet BBQ flavouring. It also came with pickled carrots, cucumbers and radish which was a nice touch since other places mostly use bean sprouts as the side veggie. 

It may be Chinese run but I think they did a great job with these two dishes I ordered. Service was fast and pricing is competitive."}
{"text":"Had a decent lunch here by the way of chicken \"bun\" vermicelli with spring roll.  One of the first time I have ordered this and it came with spaghetti type noodles instead of your regular rice noodles.  Very easy to slurp down however!  Came back satisfied and I'd return!  Spring rolls were your typical Vietnamese goodness!  NOt as much veg in the vermicelli but not too shabby!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars! My partner and I came here originally looking for the old dumpling place around this plaza, but turned out to be closed down! Despite not getting what we originally wanted, we were still quite satisfied with our meal at VIP Vietnamese restaurant!

We ordered a side of shrimp cold rolls and we each ordered the vermicelli with BBQ chicken, shrimp on sugar cane and spring roll. The cold rolls were way over-priced ($6.50 for two pieces), but the vermicelli dishes were comparable, $9.99 each. It was filling enough but not too much food. The food was good. It came with thicker vermicelli noodles, which is what I prefer. The place was quite crowded during 1pm-ish on a Sunday. 

Overall, good food, quick service and not much to complain about really. Only thing would be that some of their appetizers seemed to be overpriced. Their regular spring rolls were $5.50 for two pieces, which is crazy. I'll stick with the regular dishes like pho or vermicelli the next time I come here."}
{"text":"Their freshly deep fried soft shell crab was amazing. Freshly made, hot and juicy. The vegetable that we had was pretty good because not to salty. I had very salty ones before from other restaurants. The taste was just right. However, the porkchop was kind of disappointed but it was still alright."}
{"text":"The pho here is definitely 4 stars hands down.  The small size is way larger than the small in other pho places I've been to, and the rare beef combo was just SO satisfying.  Service is also incredibly fast - pretty sure we got our pho within 5 mintes...

The 1 star bump down is for the curry crab that we tried here... $60 for medicore curry seasoning that just filled me with a mouthful of saltiness.  I guess we uh had fun eating this crab... seeing that the shell cracker they gave us didn't work out very well.  But seriously..... stick with pho at this resto, the seafood is questionable for the amount that they are charging.

The crab meat that I managed to eat was delicious though, was just a bit put off by the subpar curry."}
{"text":"Usually good portions, stable quality and currently service.  I am a regular there since they open late.  Their Vietnamese coffee is to die for.  They also serve a small selection of local beer."}
{"text":"I can't complain about this place. Food is good, not expensive,.  Service is pretty good. But beware, sometimes on the weekend it's gets so busy you have to wait for a seat. Can't go wrong with the regular pho, but curry is a must.  Not too spicy, full on flavour. I usually do get the curry here, it taste good no matter what kind of dish you go for. Great for a family dinner or dinner for two. Go ahead and try it!!"}
{"text":"Don't mind coming for Pho.. in my opinion, regular 3 star Chinese-run pho restaurant..  there are much better places but i have chosen to come back here for a third time already..

Clean, fast service, regular pricing, spacious.. would return again at some pint or another.."}
{"text":"food was okie but nothing memorable for me.  would not venture out for this place . on teh positive side, good hours being one of the late shops open in fmp."}
{"text":"VIP is located on the side, just outside First Markham Place.  Just look for the pink sign, you can't miss it!

VIP is a Vietnamese Restaurant and they didn't impress me at all.  The seats that my girlfriend and I were at were not comfortable at all (we got a booth) to start.

My girlfriend ordered a hot and sour soup and some noodles in curry.  The soup was watered down to hell and wasn't even close to what hot and sour soup should be.  While I understand that there could be variations, maybe they should make that clear in the menu.  The noodles were the second problem as her noodles were terribly overcooked.  I ordered lemongrass chicken wings and chicken vermicelli.  The wings were awesome.  I loved them, as they were cooked perfectly.  The vermicelli was decent... to start.  As I got closer to the bottom, I started finding terribly undercooked noodles.  I only ate about half of them because the bottom half wasn't edible.  Which is a shame because the chicken that came with them was pretty good.

I told the waitor about what the problem was with both noodle dishes but he didn't seem to either understand, or care about them being overcooked and undercooked.  I don't even recall him apologizing.  If you either don't care, or understand, then why are you working there?  I didn't expect to get anything from telling the waitor, but his reaction was underwhelming.  The other waitor, who actually seated us and took our order, also took zero effort to check up on us at all, so getting the bill took longer than it should have.  The price honestly would've been worth paying if everything tasted good.

I don't plan to return here.  There are much better Vietnamese options in Markham.  I'd point anyone who wants Vietnamese to go about a minute away to the food court in First Markham Place."}
{"text":"The issue I had with this place is they claim to be a Vietnamese restaurant, yet no one there speaks Vietnamese and their menu is not in Vietnamese. It is basically Chinese people hijacking the name in order to sell you something. Another issue was when I tried to make reservations, the lady on the phone did not understand English well and hung up on me (RUDE).I would prefer for  her just say sorry and say that she did not speak English. I would of  totally understood. She also said that there was a 30 min wait (LIE). I went down there after she hung up on me and did not have to wait to be seated. The seats in the booth were uncomfortable, and hard to move around.
As for the food, it was average. They need to have more pictures of the food that they serve. Their menu has a lot of items and it can be confusing as to what to order."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive service. We had the shared meal for 6 and while the food was delicious, it was not completely authentic, not that I minded. All seafood dishes we had were especially good: crab, scallops, shrimp, and squid."}
{"text":"Large portions, great daily lunch combos under $10. I'm a fan of their spicy house special pho and their pork chop on rice was okay. Not the best place for Vietnamese food but its pretty decent."}
{"text":"VIP is just about a slightly below average place for Vietnamese food. It's not terrible but not amazing either. Most recently, I ordered a plate of they Hainanese chicken on rice, though I've tried their vermicelli bowls and pho before. Service was quick, almost too quick that you wonder how they cooked it so fast. Well, the rice is warm, the soup hot, but the chicken was cold. Like pre-made well in advance kinda cold. It does not have a distinct Hainanese flavour authentic places would make it, but it looks and taste much more like poached chicken, or \"white-cut chicken\". It's served with a few pickled radish and carrots, as well as the scallion-ginger sauce, which was too oily. Same goes for the rice, it is a bit overcooked (almost pasty) and too oily for its yellow colour. The chicken soup is also watered down considerably and does not have much of a taste. Overall it's a \"meh\" kind of place; there are better Vietnamese options within a 5-minute radius."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for a late night snack. I had just gotten off from work and I needed to get some chow down. We got in, and the place just looks mediocre. Everything looks old and moldy, you can tell alot from the floors and the furniture. We ordered our food, its pho so what can you expect right? Well I ordered spring rolls, and lo and behold they were cold. But I'm not really the type to complain so I just started eating some anyways. 

Shockingly, we were looking out the window at people walking by, and there was a small cockroach about an inch big crawling up the window. I was surprised as I have never seen one before. We called the waiter over and he leaned over and smushed it against the window. I told my friends to stop eating, as I know if they are brave enough to come out when there is a light on, and people around out in the open that there must be tonnes around. Never going back there again!"}
{"text":"I have come here a few times for Pho. This restaurant is decent in terms of food, service, and cleanliness. My go to is the grilled chicken vermicelli mung with spring rolls. They have weekday lunch specials which include a free cold drink, so that would be a good time to try out their staple menu items."}
{"text":"Nasty....

The Thai Style Tom Yum Seafood Noodle Soup was not cook properly.. The fish balls were still cold inside.....the soup lukewarm...

The soup was bland and watery... Maybe I can just bring my own Tom Yum paste and add an extra spoonful in... 

$6.50 lunch specials comes with a spring roll.. 

hmmm.. I might give this place a pass..."}
{"text":"This is not an authentic viet restaurant; menu didn't have any viet on it; menu is in chinese and English. This is chinese style cooking with viet dishes. 

Pho broth was very bland and it wasn't hot enough to cook the rare beef. A few bites into my Pho, I found small pieces of a dish washing scrubber in the bowl. Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good selection of food but just ok as their rating is. 3 star. Service was fast. Prices good except if you want crab which was 60 bucks."}
{"text":"Been eating here ever since they opened many years ago. The pho is decent. My favourite is the porkchop rice dish. Yum!"}
{"text":"I wanted to take my friend to a pho place in First Markham, and I thought it was this one. But it was actually another, quieter one.... and now that I think about it, it probably wasn't even a pho restaurant haha. But anyway, so... wrong directions! So she's been here before, I haven't.

I ordered a small bowl of pho with beef and beef balls. It turns out to be a giant bowl... Was struggling to finish! But was good :)!!! My friend had... dun dun duun... i don't remember!

Waiters were friendly too. Quick service. A LOT of things on the menu! Some Viet dishes and some common side dishes, like veggies and meat. We just had pho that day."}
{"text":"Not good pho. The beansprouts are old and stale. The broth is almost as black as sewage water.  Ordered 3 beans drink and the avocado slush .  3 beans drink is undrinkable as you can see in the picture .  And the avocado drink is too watery with no flavor. When I told the server about the drink that it's undrinkable . He said I drank it. I took only a sip . Still end up having to pay for it. This place seems like a quick cash grab.  Will not return ."}
{"text":"I really wished I yelped this place before coming here. I'm not from this area, or country for that matter, but I took my cousin's suggestion from her coworker that it's good here (probably a gwuai lo). Sigh, I'm writing this with a slight poisoning and massive bloating. My end is going to wreck havoc in a few hours.

So we were looking for a pho and we were pointed to this restaurant. My girl and I ordered the pho, thank god we ordered a small. As other reviewers said, the broth is extremely dark and it's loaded with MSG. It doesn't even come with traditional pho noodles! It comes with ho fun noodles, my first time ever seeing it in a pho bowl. Worst part is, the rare sliced beef looked quite gray, so you know it's not fresh. The beef tasted a little off, so I decided to avoid it but my girl ate all the beef, even though she didn't enjoy it. She's now experiencing symptoms of food poisoning, i.e. passing gas, back hurting, etc. Man that's possibly the worst pho I've ever had.

To end the meal, we had ordered sticky rice with mango when we were seated. What I got was a small mound of sticky rice and mango puree on top of the rice and around it like a pond. I was totally expecting the Thai version of sticky rice with fresh cut mangos and coconut milk, but I was utterly disappointed. In fact, I think the mango puree was out of a can! Ugh *hit man, that's *ucking fail. I took a little nibble, and left the whole dish untouched as we left."}
