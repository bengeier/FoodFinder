{"text":"We did the horse drawn wagon ride with dinner. It was a great experience, the cowboys were such nice people. The restaurant was a great place. The rib eye steak was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. Wish we were here on a night that they have a live band. Next time we are in steamboat we will totally come here."}
{"text":"This place is a must. We ate there twice on our trip to steamboat. 2 adults, 3 kids. Everyone loved it. Food was delicious. Get the Italian grinder. Atmosphere is one of a kind. Seems like a locals hangout. They were extremely friendly to us. Also looks like they do horse rides, 4 wheelers and that kind of stuff. Beautiful view of the lake from the parking lot."}
{"text":"We stayed here as I participated in the Glide the Divide and it was convenient, great location to stay as the after race festivities were here.   We had cabin. It was cozy, warm, comfortable bed and a nice kitchen to do our own cooking, if we like.  Frig, oven/stove, coffee maker, and dishes.  Very quiet in the evening.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  My husband had a pancakes for breakfast, which were large came with bacon and browns. Excellent breakfast.    The only downfall is I wish they started serving breakfast at 7 a.m. instead of 8 a.m.  Enjoyed a nice lunch at Hahn's after the race, they were grilling fresh burgers, veggie burgers, brats and hot dogs.  You can snowmobile right from Hahn's.   Enjoyed staying here!  Would stay again!"}
{"text":"Wow! The people here are incredibly friendly! The vibe here is so awesome, we'd totally recommend it. We got the hummus appetizer and it was delicious. It was also fun to eat unlimited peanuts out of a huge tin can at our table and throw all the shells on the floor! If you're hanging out in the Clark area be sure to come by Hahn's Peak Roadhouse! Open mic is on Friday nights and every Saturday they have dancing and live music :-)"}
{"text":"We rented 2 sleds, all day, for our party of 4. It was a blast and something we'll definitely be doing again for future Steamboat trips. The price was decent. Expect them to charge $500 on your card for a deposit which they'll void once you're all done. Plus you'll need to fill up the tank at the end of the day...I don't know why other posters are surprised by this rule? Food at the lodge was delicious too. Try the dry rub wings. 

Pros: Beautiful scenery. The rental includes a GPS tracker for safety. Nearly all the trails were in good shape. Fantastic customer service. Equipment on hand for you: helmets (w/o visor), goggles, boots, some gloves, snow pants, snow suites. Not over crowded. Good food. Close to Steamboat Springs. Trails clearly marked with orange sticks or trail markers.

Cons: They only give 1 GPS tracker per group and if your group gets split up, like ours did, the other sled is left SOL. They will charge $200/hr if they have to come find you and bring you back to base. I guess it was cheaper than a helicopter search and rescue bill. Some trails were really REALLY bumpy from so much sled traffic. The maps found randomly on boards on the trails are SUPER confusing and give you no point of reference--someone throw a \"you are here\" sticker on those bad boys!

For those not familiar with the area I suggest the following:

*Make sure every sled has a map from the rental office
*Download the area map on Google Maps (on your FULLY charged phone) so you can have a back up map even if you don't have service...which you won't. 
*Bring a backpack with a few supplies you might need like water, Cliff Bars, TP etc.
*Create a plan with your group prior to leaving so everyone will know what to do in the event that sleds get separated or if there's an emergency. Also, review the map and come up with a loose plan before departing from base.
*Ask if each sled can have a GPS tracker (I don't understand why this isn't standard practice anyway...)
*Walkie-talkies would be ideal."}
{"text":"I tried riding an ATV there.  It was my first time. The roads were badly rutted and I had a rollover.  I fractured my pelvis. The guides were very helpful and got me out by jeep, which was incredibly painful.  I was going about 4 mph when this happened.  My advice would be not to attempt this course as a novice. We had a great time until the accident and I appreciated their help when I was injured."}
{"text":"Ate here one night while staying in the area.  My husband had ribs and I had pizza.  Food was very good.  Service was excellent.  They have all kinds of stuff at this place: Lodging, ATV rentals, gas, etc.  Check them out."}
{"text":"Great food bs very friendly staff ! Just a little slow when it wasn't busy but the food was hot and fresh so worth the wait! I enjoyed the buffalo chicken wrap with a side of o ion rings which were really good (;"}
{"text":"All this place cared about was taking my money.  
Got a problem, hit the road!

Credit card company agreed and finally forced them to refund money."}
{"text":"They were out of almost everything we ordered.  Which I get that it's a small town.  The kicker is I signed my tab and the waitress put a 1 in from of my 8 dollar tip making it 18 dollars.  My Cap One credit card emailed me saying this seems like an unusual tip for the amount of the tab.  I called Hahn's peak roadhouse and talked to a guy that was super helpful and said a manager would call back.  Manager didn't call back.  I disputed the charge for the 10 dollars that the waitress decided to add to my tip."}
{"text":"Decent prices, great country atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"OK, I think it's fair to say that service can be bad from time to time anywhere, so I totally get peoples gripes.  That was not my experience at all, though.  

First off, this place is way out in the middle of one of the most scenic and beautiful places in America.  Hahn's Peak sits just behind the restaurant / bar / convenience store / rental shop / whatever the heck else this place is.

We came in for some dinner on a Saturday evening, and ended up ordering a couple of pizzas.  They were delivered with a friendly attitude is a totally reasonable amount of time, and were really quite good - Nice and cheesy, loads of toppings, etc.

There are some video games straight out to the 80's for the kids, as well as a full bar, fireplace, and pool table.  Definitely a fun spot."}
{"text":"Really really good food. Clean and cool large interior. We went in summer. There is a small playground right outside a large window. They offer trail rides etc and have a pretty big convenience store with tackle and other important supplies. I would go back for the great food and service plus maybe snowmobile in winter. About 40 min from steamboat and 5 min from steamboat lake."}
{"text":"An absolute must stop after a long day cross country skiing. Rich full flavored fresh pizza with great rustic feel. Very nice people with great scenery."}
{"text":"Service was extremely disappointing. There's was 2 other tables seated and I ate a late lunch around 3. Waited a hour and a half for our food after hiking Hahn's Peak and was DYING of hunger. My water wasn't being refilled, I had to do it myself. Salad was WARM because she forgot to bring it out. Enjoyed the curly fries (after waiting 1.5 hours to get them). After asking twice to split the check she still put it all on one card. Extremely disappointing and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food. Poor service due to under staffing. Fun atmosphere and great ride out to location."}
{"text":"Delicious home cooked food. Had the burrito and it was fantastic smothered in green chili. The burgers and sweet potato fries were delicious. A great family run business."}
{"text":"Nice diner right next to Hahn's peak. I got the biscuits and gravy which were good... but the hash browns they came with were great! I'm not sure if they were really hash browns since they were cubed potatoes. They were very crispy and tasty though. They also have a little shop as well, which is a good thing because there's nothing else around for miles."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday at 0900 for a 6 hour guided snowmobile tour. My husband had been on snowmobiles before, I hadn't. We were the only two people on our tour. Our guide's name was Ky (sp?). He was very friendly and talkative. He made sure we had all the correct gear we needed. He did talk us into upgrading to the 600s from the 550 two-strokes. Ky took us up through the Routt National Forest, up to the Wyoming border, and down the Continental Divide Trail. We were able to stop for plenty of photo ops which was great as the views were breathtaking in many places. He gave us a few opportunities to \"play\" in large open fields surrounded by hills. He did warn us where not to go, so we didn't get stuck or in trouble. After snowmobiling for three hours, he took us back to the roadhouse for lunch, which was included. 

I had the BBQ beef brisket and my husband had the fried burger. We both had curly fries. The food was hot, fresh, and delicious. The brisket wasn't the best I'd ever had. It was fatty and a little tough, but the BBQ sauce was good. 

We went out after lunch for another 45 minutes. The whole day was a blast!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a beautiful horseback ride, book at least a two hour trail ride with Hahn's Peak Roadhouse. Ask for Isaac as your wrangler if you can. Great, friendly folks, wonderful horses. My husband I and I went on our honeymoon. The ride is leisurely and gorgeous to the beautiful Steamboat Lake. We didn't eat at the roadhouse because we didn't realize we could until we got there and we'd already eaten. But the menu looked great! Make the 30 minute trip from Steamboat. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Waiting 1 hour for a salad, asked for chicken didn't get it. Wings never came. This place is terrible, sorry was the worst. Don't come here!"}
{"text":"This place is a must if you're in Steamboat, CO. It is north of Steamboat but not too far. We went there to rent snowmobiles and it was an amazing adventure. We went out on a stormy day and we were all first time riders but the staff were amazing! Zack is the best guide and took great care of us. We opted for the 4 hour tour in the national forest and it was the best decision. It is more expensive than the lake tour but it is so worth it and you get a pack lunch to take with you. You can also eat at the road house and their hot chocolate is on point. 

Pros: great staff and amazing tours. Get Zack as a tour guide if you can!

Cons: you have to drive out of Steamboat but it is not too far. It's not cheap but certainly worth the adventure."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff here, and it's a nice place to hang out for awhile. We stopped here after spending most of the morning out fishing on the lake. The Broncos game was on, and most people in there were fans who were watching. We had a couple rounds of drinks, and ordered nachos to share. They were actually quite good! This is a nice little spot to hang out and catch a game on TV, have a drink and snack, and fill up on gas outside. I'd definitely come here again when we take another trip out there."}
{"text":"Stopped by once and grabbed a patty melt,  very tasty,  on my way into town.   Went back today for a 2 hour horseback ride to the lake.   Beautiful scenery.   Cody is a fun horse to ride.   Ethan was a great guide!   Thanks!"}
{"text":"Comfortable spot to hang out by Steamboat Lake! Burgers, Reubens, Fried Pickles, Pork and other basics. Basic beer selection. Spacious lounge/dining area with outdoor deck and beach volleyball pit, and a small convenience shop."}
{"text":"Unsafe equipment. I broke my arm flying off a bald tire, sluggish brake, faulty ATV. My father in law broke 4 ribs on the same ATV! Once my arm was broken, he offered to drive it down to the base, and it flipped on top of him and nearly crushed him! Very expensive disappointment.  Cost me thousands of dollars in medical bills. I have ridden 4 wheelers for decades, never damaged a 4 wheeler and never fallen off. 
Before this terrible fall, it was really fun. :-("}
{"text":"Went to rent snowmobiles for the day - this place is horrible. Unlike any place I've ever rented from before they don't carry any snowmobile suits, boots, or even goggles. They have helmets, but no goggles?! And they don't sell any of the gear there either. Then you have to put a $1500 deposit on your credit card for each snowmobile in case of damages which I've never experienced before. You also have to buy your own gas. I don't know how a competitor hasn't come in and put this place out of business because everyone else seems to get these basics right. I can't believe I wasted my time driving out there"}
{"text":"We stayed in a cabin for close access to the lake. It's an easy drive to the lake and back. Dog friendly. The cabin was a little pricey but clean, comfortable and fairly well stocked with the essentials.  The surroundings and staff make up for what may be missing in the cabins.  The restaurant and bar offers easy breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Pizza night is the best.  My only feedback is that you may want re-evaulate the Patty Melt on the menu. It wasn't a good experience for anyone at the table. None the less we are big fans. Thank you."}
