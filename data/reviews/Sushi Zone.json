{"text":"Very good sushi, excellent value, very friendly service. A very pleasant experience all round."}
{"text":"Absolute best sushi in the area, don't waste your time with any other place. The best service ever, ran by one waitress. She's always amazing as well as the food. This is the only sushi place I frequent and their consistency is remarkable. Do yourself a favour and try them out, before people find out and they get real busy. Already, I've seen them go from barely able to fill the tiny place, to constantly being full. Really proud of them. The prices are also so fair so I always end up tipping really nicely because I can't believe how perfect everything is. The reviews don't lie! Give Sushi Zone a go"}
{"text":"A decent sushi place, had the 16 pieces sushi set comprising of Nigiri and Maki. Nothing noteworthy , but clean, reasonable and fast service. The place is quite small so it does not have any washrooms on premises . The washrooms are common ones located in the parking lot. This place is usually quite empty but has a lot of delivery and pick up business."}
{"text":"Quite a small restaurant! One of the smaller ones I've seen in the area. Maybe a lot of their business is take out?

The food is pretty good. Admittedly I didn't order the usual dinner fare so maybe I will have to go again to try  something different.

One downside is no washroom on premise and you have to use a key to walk out to the back by the carpark to use it."}
{"text":"Just a great new little sushi place. The food is tasty and the people are so very nice. It's a small place - it. might seat a dozen people - with limited visibility from Yonge St so I hope they make a go of it. I've had takeout and delivery a few times. The ingredients are always fresh. The spicy tuna Hamachi roll is my favorite. The Bento boxes are almost too big for one person. And the nabeyaki udon is so good you keep eating long after you're full."}
{"text":"I'm really mixed on this place. The sushi and the service were fantastic - really friendly server, super fresh sushi. The downside is that to use the restroom (or wash your hands), you have to take a key, leave the restaurant through a side door, go up two floors in an elevator AND walk up a flight of stairs to reach the washroom door which you then unlock. Then when your hands are clean you have to hold the key and do the full trip again to get back down. That is extremely inconvenient when you're eating and the only reason why I wouldn't go back. I feel bad for the owners because they can't help that, but it's really inaccessible. I will happily get take-out here though because the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service for a busy little place. Watch out!! Lunch specials recently went up to $9.29 each. Used to be $6.99! 
Salad is underwhelming and maki rolls are slapped together. Their quality has dropped compared to 3 years ago. Staff are extremely rude. Will be looking for a new sushi joint ... send me recommendations!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here I know I'm going to leave here with a full belly and an almost full wallet.  What I'm trying to say is that I eat alot of sushi here and don't spend too much!  It's tucked above a kickboxing dojo at the Yonge/Davisville area and is easy to miss.  Trust me though, if you miss it, you're missing out too.  

It's not that big inside and can get quite cozy.  In fact I would love it if there was some type of patio space for the summer, but once you see the place, you're realize this is altogether impossible.  In fact it's so small, there's no washroom!  What you need to do is ask the host/hostess for a key and jog your ass around and up some stairs to get to the WC.  That's ok considering the amount of calories one throws back at an average sitting here.

The service here is always friendly and the hostess will always do her very best to make you feel comfortable and at home.  That's one great thing that keeps me coming back here.  The cheerfulness of the place.  

The food is probably at or above most sushi spots in the city.  In my reality it's hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.  I've been here a few times, and the kamikaze roll absolutely slays me.  I love it to death.  I haven't had their ramen or rice plates yet, and that's because when I go to a sushi place, I order sushi.  

The prices are super reasonable, and considering the quality and service you get here, that's a bargain.  I can't recommend Sushi Zone enough.  I hope they can expand one day into a larger spot with patio seating and floorspace they deserve.  10/10!"}
{"text":"We ordered a platter here for $34 and in general 
- Sashimi pieces (15) were sliced very thin with some paper thin 
- Maki rolls were loosely rolled 
- Sushi rolls were small as well (we even got an imitation crab sushi roll which was a first for us)
Overall, so so quality with very small pieces so probably will try another place going forward!"}
{"text":"Ate here like 4 times and liked it until the 5th when I puked my guts out from what was likely bad salmon in the maki rolls.  Was seriously sick for about 30 hours.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"I got a lunch special and boy was it worth it. Each roll , albeit not the most pretty was packed with fish. The salmon roll that I had came with 8 pieces and had huge chunks of avocado and salmon, while the unagi roll that also came with it, came with 6 pieces and had only unagi in it (which is completely fine by me as most other inexpensive sushi restaurants skimp out on it). After tax and tip my lunch was only about $10. The only downside is that there is no washroom on site and seating is limited, so this place really is best for takeout. But, if you are dining in, the waitress that served me was fast and friendly, so no complaints there.  
I left here with a full belly and a happy wallet. Come check this place out."}
{"text":"This place used to be Roll & Roll, which I loved! Not sure why the name change. 

1) The pricing here is very good. This place is a great value for quality. 

2) The service is off the chart amazing. The server is incredibly friendly and literally makes you feel as if you have entered the home of a dear friend.

3) I feel the quality has gone down a bit since the name change...I frequent here quite often. The rolls a bit more ricey, fish portions smaller...however, I have only been here once since the change and perhaps it was an off night.

I really love this place though. So relaxed and friendly. Hope the food keeps up, as that is ultimately the reason I go."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Sushi place at least once a week over the past year. The place was great when it first started. They offered 20% off for cash payments on dine-in which was great. The food was good and cheap. The service started out okay but these days it is TERRIBLE. On a recent visit with my friends, we had to ask twice for the server to clean the only table that could accomodate all of us. After that, it took another 20 minutes for her to come back and take our order then another 20 minutes for any of the food to arrive. Did I mention that the restaurant was empty other than our group? Goodluck getting a water refill without having to ask. You may have to flag the server down a few times just to get anything. They only have one server unfortunately, which is probably the source of all these problems because she handles both the dine-in customers as well as the take-out and delivery calls so she always seems really frazzled, busy and running around. I was there last week for a late dinner, I seat myself and she comes over and asks me what I want to order... she didnt even bother giving me a menu -_-'

The worst part is that me and my friends are regulars who train at the gym downstairs so we're here all the time and unfortunately the service has been consistently bad lately. There are tons of sushi places in this block alone, there is Sushi Supreme across the street (better prices + more food for your money + open later +excellent service) and Echo Sushi further down the street (AYCE.) Save your money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I don't remember how many times me and my bf ordered their maki box. 

We always stick to their spicy maki box and tempura maki box. They comes with such good deals. The prices I believe were around $15, and $12 for the other one. Each box you get 24 pieces of sushi, and they were big pieces. Also each box comes with a salad and a soup. 

Can't be more satisfied with their maki. Also did I mention free delivery on just-eat if you over $15?!"}
{"text":"cons- poisonous food that gave me a lot of abdominal pain and diarrhea after eating.

2 dollars for a small orange juice bottle that does not qualify as juice but rather, kool aid with a paragraph of artificial additives and no vitamin c.

the soy sauce tasted like pure vinegar. it was awful. it tasted lkke pure acid.

pros- none this was the worst sushi experience i have had in my life. i am thinking of calling the police for safety reasons. this place should be shut down."}
{"text":"Soggy and bland food. We've had sushi over the past 2 weeks and this is by far the worst. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Solid sushi for a very reasonable price. This small sushi joint might be one of my favs for cheap japanese food which doesn't compromise on quality. Specialty rolls have good portions and are mostly under $10. We ordered the U U Roll since my friend doesn't eat raw food and it was so creamy! We also ordered the tempura dinner, it's only $9 and it includes 5 pieces of shrimp, 10 pieces of veggies, miso soup, salad and a bowl of rice. The tempura is freshly battered and deep fried so it was light and crispy. Just the way I like it. The kalbi we ordered is pretty good. Moist and full of flavor, it didn't have a lot of fat which is what I prefer. I also like how they added a little bit of cabbage, onions and carrots instead of just bean sprouts. The kalbi dinner also includes the soup, salad and a bowl of rice. It's only $11. 

Overall I'm very satisfied with the quality of food and service. Our server was very attentive and pleasant. Only complaint is the washroom is oddly placed and it's a very small joint. Only about 4 or 5 tables that seats 4 and 3 tables that seats 2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Came back the second time, the raw sushi isn't that great. It's fine for its price, but not really worth the drive if you're not in the area. Their rolls and cooked food is much more solid."}
{"text":"Used to order from this place for take out alot but recently they changed their sushi lovers platter from 12.95 to 14.95 then again to 18.95! Without adding anything extra to make it even slightly worth it.  GREEDY and you've lost my business"}
{"text":"I've never been to the restaurant but as far as take-out sushi goes, this is my go to.  Super fast, very reasonable prices and always fresh!"}
{"text":"This review is based on a delivery order. 

I've been patronizing Sushi Zone for a few years now, and they have remained consistently one of the better sushi restaurants in the area. 

Fried appetizers are light, with their Tonkatsu and Gyoza deserving special mention (though their Ponzu could be more tart), and the signature rolls, like the Executive roll with lime and cilantro are unique and well designed. 

Fish is fresh and portions generous. Rolls could be tighter and cut more evenly, but if that's the only bad thing to say about the place, I'll take it. :)"}
{"text":"It's local, it's cheap, food is consistently good for \"fast-food sushi\".

I can't complain. I'm not looking for Michelin stars here. I'm looking for fast, reliable, budget friendly and craving satisfaction.

There are a wide array of options on the menu, and take out deals, lunch deals, and combo deals.

It's not a big place with lots of staff I've seen a total of three people each of the 3 times I've visited. 

It's now my \"sushi-day\" lunch place :)"}
{"text":"Used to order online a lot from just eat. Decent food and good veg options. However they recently increased their prices by quite a bit, which I am not a fan of."}
{"text":"I wrote another review on Google and will say again that this place has a good attitude and that the lunch specials are a really good deal. I think it is a family run business with the hubby as the Chef and the wife as the server. K1 on the lunch menu that is on until 3 pm is a great deal And very tasty as well as filling. The eel dish that is served with flame burning right to your table is the best. I am not a raw fish eater so it is good to be able to explore these other options that Sushi Zone has to offer. I do not think one can be disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sushi in the davisville area! My only issue is the inside is awful. I only do take out/justeat/ubereats ... ignorance is tastefully blissful ! Love their crunch roll and spicy salmon. Their bento boxes are massive! It's also super affordable. Their party trays have rolls you actually want and again great cost. Always delivers early/on time."}
{"text":"There are not many good sushi spots at Yonge and Davisville. This spot is great for takeout. It's cheap, fresh, and quick.  Very small interior, which is why we stick to takeout.  I really like it, especially if you are not in the mood to splurge."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi takeout place for the Davisville area, and I've tried them all.  I have never dined in the restaurant (they took over that old Polish resto a few steps north of the Davisville TTC station), but they have good customer service over the phone and in their delivery staff.

When they opened, they offered a 20% discount (with no minimum order) on dine-in and delivery. This is a bargain.  I would easily pay full price for their tasty food, but with the discount I usually wind up ordering more than usual.  I believe the discount is still on, but there is now a minimum order.  That's a relief, because I was worried this little gem might close down, but apparently it's booming.

The best dishes are any bento box but esp. the vegetarian (with delicious and substantial yam/avocado roll), any sushi pizza, pan fried udon with chicken, and all the maki.  I'm not too crazy about their soft-shelled crab (way too small), ikayaki (a little dry), or their house salad dressing (tasteless and looks like... no, I won't say it. I always order plain salad, i.e. iceberg lettuce).

The prices are fabulous, the service is awesome, and the food is a step above the competition. You can't go wrong here."}
