{"text":"Finalmente la vera cucina Italiana e ovviamente Napoletana,uno spettacolo,ottimo pesce,cucinato a regola d'arte,un servizio a 5 stelle ma con il potere di farti sentire a casa,Marcello e Carmine sono due signori nel senso cavalleresco del termine.
Consiglio questo ristorante a tutti,ma se vi sentite lontani da casa e volete mangiare la vera cucina Italiana andate su Weston Rd, e godetevi lo spettacolo culinario,la gradevolissima compagnia e musica dal vivo.
