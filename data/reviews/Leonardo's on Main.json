{"text":"Gourmet Pizzeria  Yum! Spelt pizza dough - thin crust from local growers, and local mill. (and source local fresh ingredients too)  Deluxe includes fresh sliced tomatoes, mushrooms, green pepper, onions and it seemed a tonne of other toppings.  But you can create your own specialty selections of toppings including:   Farmer's Daughter | Grilled Chicken, Broccoli, Cheddar, Mozzarella or Mediterranean | Genoa Salami, Feta, Black Olive, Red Onion, Roasted Garlic or Chicken Avocado White | Grilled Chicken, Avocado, Tomato, Cheddar, Fresh Jalape√±o Pepper, Roasted Garlic, Herbs (Virgin Olive Oil Base, No Tomato Sauce)  They make their own pizza dough.  Delivery, and catering as well.  I think I'm getting hungry   LOL  I wish I lived closer too :)"}
