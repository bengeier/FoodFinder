{"text":"This is my favourite place for eggs benedict in YYC. While waits can be longer on the weekend for brunch because it's such a cosy small little nook, you know it's worth the wait because it's insanely good. Handily enough, they can contact you via phone when your table is ready, and conveniently there's a Starbucks just down the road to grab a cup of joe from. Usually by the time I have one, the table is ready to go. For the eggs benny I sometimes add avocado just for that extra fattening creaminess, but for the amount of times I eat it, it's worth it to go big Benny or go home. The result is fabulous - the bun, hollandaise, everything is delicious and goes great with the seasoned hashbrowns. I have no time for snapping pics of this incredible breakfast because  once it arrives, it's too darn good to be frittering your time away with filters and such. Just enjoy it."}
{"text":"Chorizo hash had no visible chorizo, just occasional heat in a bite of pulled pork. So much sweet potato/yam and worse was that it was undercooked! Yuck. Waitresses discussing how to get people to eat and leave fast right beside us. Very rude and didn't make us feel welcome. A bad experience to have pleasant digestion. Won't go back. And I sought this place out as we are from out of town."}
{"text":"The lineup wasn't as bad as people mentioned, there is certainly worse waits for Brunch in Calgary - for good reason.  Only thing good about this place is their coffee - which isn't even their own  I ordered the pulled pork hash and it was bland. Meat was dry. They try to be Calgary hipster with sweet potatoes, but it's just not that great. The onions were cut like the chef was being lazy - which overpowered the dish. Same thing happened with my gf's granny smith grilled cheese sandwich. One would think that a tart granny smith infused grilled cheese would have sweet caramelized onions, not barely cooked almost raw sharp onions almost an inch thick! It was like eating a raw onion sandwich with some melted cheese.  I would choose OEB, Galaxie or Diner Deluxe over this place any day."}
{"text":"Friendly with good food for brunch or dinner. Good long bar = great for solo diners. A few good spots nearby too. Not a huge menu. Mostly burgers,  including vegetarian options, good salads, some tacos. The bison chilli here is fantastic."}
{"text":"Went in Sunday night. The service was excellent. The team always made sure we were taken care of and didn't wait for anything. Timing was good. Items delivered quickly but we didn't feel rushed.  My daughter loved the buttermilk chicken sandwich. My son had brisket in his mac and cheese. He liked the fact that it was stirred in and not sitting on top.  I had the brisket and grits. The veggies were tasty when I mixed them in with the grits. Brisket was good but wished I would have used some hot sauce after I finished.  Cheese cake was refreshingly unique and delicious. It didn't last long.  Good food and a good experience puts me in a good mood so I was a happy man."}
{"text":"We decided an early lunch was in order - a good decision. Another good decision was to go to the Blue Star Diner. The third one was to ask for less fries with our burgers. The plates come full of food. But is it good! My lamb burger was delicious, and my friend ate all of his beef burger, a rarity. So I guess that was good too. The service was attentive, but at no time did we feel that we were being pushed out. That is the one issue about this place. It is too small for the rather large clientele, making it always full, and causing people to wait at lunch time,  I had previously passed this place by, thinking it was just another hole in the wall, but since my friend recommended it, I won't be doing that again."}
{"text":"I've been going to Blue Star since they opened. I *hate* waiting in line for any place but I find I don't mind it here. They offer to get you a coffee or tea plus they bring refills to you on the street while you wait.  That's a nice service touch and a welcome one when you're desperately needing that caffeine fix before your breakfast.   I've been trying a different menu item each time I've been and that hasn't been easy. Most times I recall what I've had before and want to return to those items to revisit them. Soon...   Portion sizes are generous, their philosophy of using as many locally produced ingredients is a good one. They even have an extensive selection of items that are gluten free and designated as such on the menu. That's not an issue for me, but I do have friends who have that sensitivity and it's really appreciated by them.  It's become my go to brunch place in the city. I've introduced many friends to it and everyone has since been back and enjoyed their follow up visits.   2/30"}
{"text":"Been a regular at Blue Star for a while now because of it's convenience, as well as amazing food. I've always been there for dinner so can't comment on breakfast but I've heard that's great. Everything I've tried there as been amazing - soup, tacos, burgers, meatloaf, salad, fries, and desert. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Favourite breakfast in Calgary. Great use of local products. Service very attentive, you will be able to drink a pot of coffee if you like.  Good size portions, nice selections of breakfast items, Hueuvos Rancheros is a highlight. Lunch is great, try the burger with yam fries. Sit at the small bar when alone. Great whisky available, local beers"}
{"text":"This place is seriously my favourite place for breakfast. The environment is very hipsterish and unique. The place is alwaaays packed but there's a reason it always is. When you first walk in you'll have to put your name on the list and wait a while but it's all good because they serve you coffee or juice while you wait and you just talk and mingle with people in line. The staff is awesome and very friendly. The food is amazeballs. Whether you're having breakfast, lunch or dinner, it's all fantastic! You will not be disappointed when you go! Trust me ;) Plus, Bridgeland is a fantasic hangout spot"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch service....We must commend the staff for going out of their way to help us get to our doctor's appointment on time.  It didn't help that I got lost (yes I was using Google Maps...but still missed my turn) leaving us half an hour for lunch.  We were lucky to get a seat and I asked the server if we could be out of there in half an hour and she said she would put a rush on our order and lo and behold there were our omelettes in less than five minutes (or so it seemed).  We enjoyed every bite and were only ten minutes late for our appointment.  Mom made me promise to take her to the Blue Star Diner again when we have more time so she can enjoy the meal.  :)"}
{"text":"So blue star diner is one of our favourite places to go and today we visited and saw that they have a new menu. everything seems pretty good on the menu however there are certain things that are not on there, that used to be our favourite dish. One of our favourite dishes is the tofu scramble, however it's no longer available as the chef has replaced it with something heartier and includes rice for breakfast. ... Typically we don't eat rice for breakfast so it's not something that we would order again but we wanted to give one of the vegan breakfast dishes a chance and try it out. The dish itself it's not bad however it's not something that we would re-order instead of the vegan scramble. The thing we appreciate about blue Star diner is that they had the vegan scramble option for us to eat, but now it's coming to the point where we may not visit as often because their vegan options are not big. Meaning that they don't have the option that they have gluten-free and vegan at the same time. One suggestion we would give, is that some restaurants when trying out a new menu, actually still offer the option of the older items thus giving loyal customers the opportunity to choose old items that are not on the menu anymore and easing them into the new menu. I believe loyal customers come for the items on the menu, and if you are going to do a new menu, still have the kitchen prepare the options that are they no longer want to cook, but have them available for the loyal customers because you don't want to lose them."}
{"text":"I've been in search of the ultimate breakfast burrito ever since my time living in Colorado. The search has eluded me and although there have been notable entries, such as Galaxie Diner, nothing has come close for more than a decade.   Until yesterday.   I've heard much ado about Blue Diner. And after passing it on Sunday morning I decided it was time to check-in. We were placed on the waiting list and given some coffee and a smile. Great start.   After taking a spot at the bar we were gregariously entertained by Rob who is also part owner. After learning that he drank his weight in melon balls the night before - and looking no worse for the wear - he suggested his namesake Roborito.   Man. That was the burrito I've been searching for. Presented with a half ribbon Ã¼ber fresh avocado, it was the da kine.   The experience was a taste of the fresh ingredients and organic qualities of Blue Diner.   If you haven't been. You simply must. It's to die for.   Yelp yelp and away."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give a great review of Blue Star as I love Dairy Lane, but unfortunately, my first experience wasnt stellar. I will give 5 stars for the service, and the coffee, as well as the cute venue. Its probably my fave decor of all the breakfast places I've been to. It reminds me of being in a cottage in Virginia, with the pastel yellows and blues.  I ordered the Banana Pancakes and my friend the Huevos Rancheros. My server asked it I have had the, before, to which I replied no. She told me they were awesome....which got me excited. They turned out to be only ok. I actually think they were a bit undercooked. The fruit served with it was beautiful and fresh, but came in a very small portion.  My friend said his Huevos were just average as well. Again, all the ingredients were fresh, but didnt have much flavour.  Blue Star is a bit pricey and gets very busy, as mentioned by other reviewers, but Im definately going to give it another chance the next time Im in the area."}
{"text":"They serve quality food with natural ingredients. They have fast and attentive staff that took good care of us. All in all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambiance and friendly staff. Greatly enjoyed our Sunday lunch/dinner here! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I heard this place is the BEST brunch place in Calgary , so I got up early on Saturday to try it with a friend. The overall service is okay but the food is not as good as it sounds.   I always order egg benedict for brunch so I can objectively compare all the brunch restaurants. I order a smoked salmon egg benedit. The eggs were cooked solid through which is a major fault for an egg benedict and I specifically asked for runny yolk!!! Okay..if a brunch restaurant can't do eggs right, I don't know what is it good for.   My friend ordered a western omelette, the special during the Stampede, the whole dish looks like random pieces of meat and eggs placed together. Nothing special and  tastes bland to me.   I am not from Calgary and have lived in Europe, States and Asia. Calgary restaurants are a joke and seeing those reviews, it is apparent to me that Calgarian simply have no idea what good restaurants and food SHOULD taste like. This place is just mediocre at the best."}
{"text":"Be warned, while my wife loved the decor, the look of the features menu, and the whiskey cocktails right away, she got unexcited pretty quickly after waiting 35 minutes for one takeout burger at six on a Monday night.  This place is always packed. So if you are heading out for burger week, block lots of time. The burger itself was a generous traditional banquet burger (don't really see the advantage of highly marbled Wagyu beef when you're mincing it), BUT the fries were incredibly delicious! The thin, crispy, nutty, salty Kennebec potato fries alone push it to 4 stars. The apologetic staff helped too."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or dinner! Local ingredients are used as much as possible, & they are all super yummy!  The space is fresh & welcoming. Excellent service, even when you are waiting in line! My fav's on the menu - lamb burger & eggs Benny!"}
{"text":"I went here this past week and had a lovely little lunch with my family. It has a wonderful atmosphere, the decor is calming and relaxed.  The seating is pretty limited so be prepared to wait during the peak times for sure..but I found glaring at people who were almost done to be a very effective way to get a table, jk! :b  I had the blue star salad with bacon, it was lovely..could have been slightly bigger, seeing as it was the full (meal size), but very tasty for sure. Their selection of tea is wonderful and you get your own personal little steeper, which is a nice touch...and that is what I love about this place the nice little touches! :)"}
{"text":"I ended up in the Blue Star diner because their taco entry into the Calgary Taco Fiesta contained the words \"Pork belly\". I was there just before the lunch hour rush and waited a couple of minutes to be seated.   I chose to sit at the bar and found the service to be personable, attentive and quick. In spite of this, the food took its sweet time showing up. While I waited, I got to admire the decor which was very modern and not at all what I expect from eateries with \"diner\" in their name  My tacos eventually showed up - pork belly marinated in Dr Pepper with jicama coleslaw and sauce. Taste? The bomb. Tacos are such a simple concept that it's easy to mess them up by getting too complicated. This taco kept things simple and showcased the very well-prepared pork belly.  I was pretty happy until the bill showed up. Then I downshifted to moderately happy. This is not a cheap diner by any stretch of imagination."}
{"text":"Great service, great coffee (fratellos) and really good food. My girlfriend loved her eggs Benny and I got a \"triple double\". You can really taste how fresh the ingredients are and it makes a huge difference. Get there early for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood so I eat at Blue Star often.  It never fails to be delicious, and the service never fails to be outstanding.  It gets busy sometimes, but the wait is worthwhile.  Blue Star is probably my favourite breakfast/brunch place in the city.  I also love how it's open quite late so you can get food after most places have already closed."}
{"text":"Went out to lunch here yesterday and ordered burgers.  I was perfectly willing to pay more for the applewood chedder and the whole time I am waiting for my meal I am looking at the art which is blocks of chedder.  That is probably why I was disappointed with the thinnest slice of cheese I have ever seen.  It melted completely into the burger and I was only able to taste it in one bite.  I don't mind paying extra but I expect a visible wedge of cheese.  The burger was good but lacking the flavor I expected.  My husband ordered the burger special which was supposed to have a horseradish spread and tomato marmalade-again more hype than realized flavor.  He said the horseradish sauce was glopped onto one side and he got it all in one of the last bites.    I think breakfast is better here."}
{"text":"Small, but bright little spot for brunch! The wait is quite short compared to other brunch spots, and I love that it's brightly lit with a lot of natural light.   Tried something new this time & the stuffed french toast was AMAHZINGG =) I love their chunky hash browns too. They always have locally produced jams & spreads, so if you have some sort of toast make sure you try them!"}
{"text":"Great service. Fast and genuinely friendly. Wait wasn't bad to be seated, order was taken promptly, and food arrived quickly. Decor and layout is pleasant. Now the two stars not earned. Mexicali omelette was a generous portion but overcooked and boring. Side of hashbrown potatoes were also ho-hum and dry. Price was high for average food."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Blue Star!  Pros: Great location Beautiful, clean interior Super, awesome, great staff - I can't express this enough Delicious, amazing food - I usually come for brunch, everything is good but the eggs bennie on gluten free buns is my personal fave Good portion sizes Bottomless coffee, great teas Has alcoholic beverages as well Supports local  Cons: Can be a little pricey, especially with the gluten free add-on  At times the wait can be long, but it's expected and they serve you coffee/tea while you wait They don't deliver to my house :)  Of course I will be back... many, many times.  Can't beat the great service you get here every time!"}
{"text":"The service here was delightful! We were greeted in such a friendly manner immediately upon entering, and our server was absolutely charming.  The food, although it looked very appealing, left something to be desired. We ordered the chicken tacos with sweet potato fries and the bison burger with a salad.  The chicken tacos fell apart immediately (there was only a single tortilla), and were very dry. The taste was there, but the mouth feel and appeal were not. The bison burger had a very nice flavor as well but was incredibly dry. As these are both lean proteins, this is not unusual, but they were definitely more dry than expected.  The sweet potato fries with aÃ¯oli were amazing! The salad was a little bit boring... This would not be enough to bring us back, but perhaps we just landed an off night."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in less than a week.  I think that may be a record for me.  Even went twice in one day!  Needless to say, I really like this restaurant.  Went once for breakfast and twice for din.  Everything I've ordered there (or tasted from my dining companions) has been delish.  Food tastes fresh, well seasoned and high quality.  Nice to have a selection of meat, veg and even a few vegan options.  Service was good for the most part, although we did wait for quite a while one evening with empty drinks and plates long since cleared with no offer for more drinks or the bill.  We finally had to flag down a server to ask for our bill.  That's the only slightly negative thing I can say about the place, and it was really not a big deal.  Overall, I think that Blue Star is an excellent restaurant for any meal of the day. Yum!"}
{"text":"Turns out Blue Star just opened today, so my idea to stop by and check it out worked out pretty well.  This small, charming little diner was surprisingly steady for a place that just opened up, but with the Dairy Lane name behind it, it's no big surprise.    They have a really big breakfast menu, but since my friend and I stopped in at around 1pm, we stuck to their lunch food (note to self: come back for breakfast).  I had a grilled cheese with pesto, roasted red peppers and gouda cheese on rye bread, which was super tasty.  It could've used a little more cheese, but I like my grilled cheese to be over the top, so that could just be a personal preference.  My friend had their chicken burger with yam fries and also thought it was really good.  Both meals were under $15, so reasonably priced too.  The staff were really friendly and helpful and even the owner/manager stopped by our table to see how we liked everything.  Overall, cute little place with great food and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I ate here recently with my brother. Really good place. Living in Brooklyn, my brother and I joked that this place would fit right in in Carroll Gardens.   There were a lot of great menu options. We can vouch for the gingerbread pancakes, burger, fries, and hash browns.  Bonus for full bar and super nice servers. I'd definitely return if ever in Calgary again.  One minus: no espresso."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to check out this place and have since come back. Normally we like to try new places every time. But this one was worth a second visit.   Our waitress started by bringing us coffee. Good start. A good brunch always starts with coffee.   My friend ordered blueberry pancakes and I ordered the vegan scramble. Now I am no vegan or vegetarian whatsoever but this was one hell of a tasty dish. The sundried tomatoes, toast and jam on the side, avocado, tofu that doesn't even taste like tofu, ...you get the idea.   The only small con (if you can call it that) is the really close proximity of tables to other tables. It's definitely 'intimate' but to each their own. The place is clean, tastefully decorated, and the soap in the washroom smells wonderful.   We loved the blackboard of the names of the producers who supply Blue Star some of their ingredients as well as the photographs on the wall that made us feel oh-so-Albertan.   And hey, we might even be back for a third visit!"}
{"text":"This was an incredible experience! We came as a group, but each of us was treated and taken care of like an individual. Setting was comfy and inviting, easy for us as a group to be together. And the food? WOW. Delicious, plated beautifully and well priced. The cocktails menu was deceptive... but I was able to order off menu and still enjoy a relaxing drink."}
{"text":"I chose this diner because it was votes number one place in Calgary for brunch in 2013. It definitely lived up to the award! My waitress was charming and personable, and made sure we had a great experience. The omelette was made perfectly. They have the best Caesar I've had in a long time with a Montreal steak spice rim and pickled asparagus garnish."}
{"text":"Looking to pass some time and a place to have 2nd breakfast, we wandered into Blue Star. Surprisingly, there wasn't a line even at prime brunching hour but we weren't complaining.  We hopped up by the the bar and glanced over the menu as we sipped our teas & coffees. My sis and I decided to split the fried chicken and pancakes, and her fiancÃ© got a bowl of their Thai curry soup.  The turnover is pretty quick here, I think it's due to their speedy service. We got our food and were in and out in less than an hour.  I am a huge fan of savoury breakfasts, and this pancake dish solidifies my love for them. The hot sauce butter and red-eye gravy sauce really brought everything together.  Although I don't tend to dine at places that don't take resos, I'm glad I got the chance to try out Blue Star"}
{"text":"Consistently amazing! It's almost always full so do allow yourself some time. Should you be claustraphobic or dislike being in cramped quarters, you may want to opt for another location. Service is fairly attentive and i have yet to try a dish i don't thoroughly enjoy! Reasonably priced as well!"}
{"text":"Went here with my aunt and everything is delicious and well priced. I got the banana blueberry pancakes with some fruit and jasmine green tea cuz I still had a cold. Warmed me right up, everything tastes great and our server was super friendly too.  Even for a Tuesday it was pretty busy but very nice little place in bridgeland for breakfast."}
{"text":"My daughter loves eating here for lunch. Fantastic simple gf buns here - I believe from Carebakery. I usually get their salads plus half an avocado on the side. Veggie burger is super tasty too and house made pickles are a bonus!  If you have little ones and waiting is not an option ,recommend going slightly before noon to maybe avoid the wait!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork Bennies? !  Need I say more.   This place is an absolute gem. The decor is simple, modern and somewhat trendy.  Their portions are large and are sure to leave you satisfied.   The coffee is fresh,  dark, and free flowing.  The staff are quick on top ups and never let you see the bottom of your cup.  There is fresh cream on the tables and an old school sugar shaker.   There is a huge selection of breakfast cocktails available after 10 am including Day of the dead-beceaser which is sure to cure any hangover,  or take you on your way to one!    The fresh jam brought to the tables is yummy! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The first time my boyfriend  and I decided to visit Blue Star Diner we decided the line up was too long and so we went elsewhere. However, we lived only a block away from the restaurant and so after walking past a full restaurant and delicious food everyday, we decided  that it must be worth the wait.   On our second visit to the diner, we were told the wait would be around 45 minutes, but this time the manager took down our phone number and said he would call us when the table was free. After a quick coffee down the road we were called back to the restaurant and we arrived to a small table prepared for us. The selection of breakfast and cocktails on the menu was hefty, as was the size of my tasty eggs benny and hash browns. The menu catered to a variety of diets; vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free and the eggs were sourced locally. TWO THUMBS UP.  ** After a successful breakfast we decided to go back for a second visit during a quieter period in the evening. The dinner menu again was extensive but the taste was not quite up to the standard of its breakfast.   I would definitely visit again and wait the wait, but only for the Blue Star brunch."}
{"text":"Everything I have had here is delicious. I LOVE the stuffed French toast with hollandaise. Also love all of their burgers. One of my favorite spots any time of day."}
{"text":"I am so down with breakfast and I am down with this place. Bridgeland has some wicked breakfast choices and blue star is worth checking out.  I came a bit early and had a few minutes to kill while waiting a bit for my date. My friendly server hooked me up with a nice earl grey tea with soy milk on the side. Their tea comes in it's own individual size bodum - which I love!   We both loved the decor of this place - it's so fresh and bright. While we were waiting for our food to come, seeing other peoples orders lets me know there are some amazing things to try. The stuffed french toast looked so awesome - they have both a sweet option and a savoury option. My date and I both had the traditional breakfast with bacon and we both fell silent as we tucked into the first few bites, following that initial taste with a solid \"mmmmm\".  Loved it all, good bacon, great potatoes, a nice rye toast, awesome jam on the side. There wasn't so much as a scrap left on either of our plates by the end of it.  This lady loves brunch and this place rules."}
{"text":"Why, Why, Why can't I find anyplace in this city to \"wow\" me. I have been in many countries, and never had a city with such mediocre food! I have had decent food, but nothing to rave about. If a place does serve something decent, everyone jumps on the band wagon and copies.  I was so looking forward Blue Star Diner and whilst it was okay, not anything more than plain ole sausage and scrambled eggs.  The Benny was okay, the hash browns were nothing special and the coffee people rave about....really? The entire brekkie was about $50 which blows my mind. Oh yes, and got to sit at the bar - charming....the guy beside having a beer at 9:00 a.m.  I guess I will stay home and make my bacon and eggs, toast, and coffee for about.....$3.00 instead of $30.  Way too overpriced."}
{"text":"very busy for the breakfast rush, however dinner you usually can get a table right away. Staff really know their menu, glad to see gluten free is on the majority of the menu and staff definitely take it seriously. Decent amount of food for the price, you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"This place is a favourite of my friends, and so we came here for brunch on a day off. I ordered the Bridgeland Breakfast bowl and it was delicious! The hollandaise sauce was perfect over the poached eggs and hash. The service and atmosphere here was great as well. I will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Excellent gastropub (or gastro-diner?). It isn't your grandparent's diner for sure. It's all gourmet here.  The wait is considerable on the weekend but they were nice enough to let me do \"to-go\" while taking the food outside and eating out on the table.  The two eggs (4/5) - beautifully cooked and filling as you would expect.  Bison chili (5/5) - very flavorful and filling  Lamb Pastrami sandwich (5/5) - super flavorful and very large portion. Delicious fries!"}
{"text":"I've been a frequent patron of Dairy Lane for several years,  going there several times a week since I discovered them in my own neighborhood! I was delighted when Blue Star (Dairy Lane #2) opened. Perfect for when you want something that's just a little bit different, but mostly the same. Consistent, high quality diner fare delivered with personable service in a comfortable setting is their specialty.   Usually when a place I really like gets established, their standards start to falter. You can literally see the turning point where a decision is made: \"We've made it! Now let's cut corners for mucho profit!\" This has NOT happened at \"the Dairy,\" and I don't see it happening at the Blue Star.   Behind the friendly, casual approach of the staff, the frequent patron begins to see how deliberate and professional they are about delivering exquisitely attentive service--all the while making it look effortless. Not once have I had a coffee cup sit empty, as an example.   Now to the food. Amongst many favorites, the soft-shell tacos (6 different kinds) are truly outstanding. The steak and frites is a terrific underpriced bargain. Blue Star do a unique spin that breathes new life into the ubiquitous nachos and salsa. You won't be disappointed, even if you though you were tired of nachos!"}
{"text":"Points to this place for decor. There's so much to look at and the staff make you feel like you're family. The food is 100% what you should expect from a truck spot. Real, home cooked food, good prices and good people. We went for a Saturday morning breakfast and the special was sweet! Would definitely come back when feeling like a good greasy breaky."}
{"text":"Still loving Blue Star after more visits. I love when your subsequent visits are as good as your first. My husband loves the pulled pork hash and the eggs benny. I'm still partial to the chicken burger or the chili. Always local and always fresh, what more is there to ask for?"}
{"text":"Blue Star Diner is a great place for food lovers that aren't about to foot the cash for a place like NOtaBLE. It is very chic and a great place for conversation with friends or a romantic date. They pay close attention to your needs and really source some of the freshest local ingredients. I envy the people that live nearby as this is one that I will get in the car and drive for!"}
{"text":"Great service and delish burgers! Every time I pop into Bridgeland I have to have something at blue star. The wait can be long during peak time so go by early to snag a spot."}
{"text":"Sad to say, but my last experience here wasn't nearly as good as it was the first time.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, which were okay, but the pan fries that I was SO looking forward to were replaced with those horrible little deep fried (previously frozen, I'm sure) potato nuggets that looked like a French fry that you get at places like Dennys, etc. with their breakfasts.  My husband ordered an omelet, which was obviously overcooked, and he was just as disappointed as I when he saw the pan fries were M.I.A.  My husband decided to give it another try as he was meeting some clients in the neighborhood and that was a close restaurant for them to meet.  Again, no one liked the tasteless little potato thingies and my husband's omelet was overcooked.  He wasn't about to send it back as they were on a time schedule.  One fellow had the egg sandwich and apparently there wasn't much to it at all and the other fellow had the Eggs Bennie, which were good so that was something.  That fellow may return there again as he lives in the neighborhood.    My husband won't be returning any time soon, I'm thinking.  Me - you can get okay breakfasts at a lot of places in Calgary and I like good pan fries with my breakfast so it's back to the other places that have them.  If I'm going out to eat a big not-inexpensive breakfast one day on the weekend, it has to be super special!"}
{"text":"Trendy space. Great vibe. Lots of choice. Delicious food. Friendly staff. Tables are bit too close for my liking but it's all good.   Would definitely recommend for a nice meal out."}
{"text":"I really love this place the food is so amazing. The atmosphere is also great and it's usually always busy as well. I would give this place 3/5 because I've actually never had good service here, they always seem to forget about us, or give us the wrong drinks etc, but the food is so good that I cant bare to give it less than 4/5."}
{"text":"I take most of my out of town visitors here for breakfast. It's always a hit! The wait is never super long. But I always try and go early.   Drinks here are wonderful as well!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a couple girlfriends. I'll be back,  and back, and back, and back. Such a comfortable place with amazing food. I had the lamb burger and I am just dying for more."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to eat in Calgary. I loved the vegan-friendly menu and staff, and the sweet potato fries were the best I've ever eaten! It was exciting to have multiple veggie burgers to choose from, and I was very happy with the Mediterranean Veggie Burger. My friends ordered breakfast and really liked it, so I would highly recommend this place for any meal of the day.  I also appreciated that they were a part of Mealshare and working to make the community better."}
{"text":"I have driven past Blue Star Diner many times. Always a line up, right out the door. As such, I have never stopped. I am often pressed for time, so when I do have time, I don't like to waste it waiting around if at all avoidable.  So on a recent weekend morning, when I was awake absurdly early and my head had time to shake the cobwebs, found that it was early enough to consider driving past Blue Star to see what lines were like. Being 8:30am on a Saturday, there were several tables open. Yippee!  Service is quick! We had coffee within moments of being seated. (& the coffee is goooooood!) Within seconds of deciding what we wanted, our orders were taken. Staff were very friendly, but not at all obnoxious.  Servings were generous - I had the all-in omelet & J had a breakfast burrito. Both were tasty. I especially loved the hashbrowns. Big, homestyle potatoey goodness.  I especially love the blackboard, that lists all their local suppliers - first names & all. Pretty awesome if you ask me (but I'm a localvore whenever possible.)  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Blue Star is great! We've ordered take out a couple times and the food never disappoints, that's for sure! The stuffed French toast is to die for!  The nice thing about Blue Star is that they do takeout on weekends - whereas the popular places in the area (OEB, for example) do not."}
{"text":"The search for the best breakfast place in Calgary is over. From the service, to the coffee, to the eggs benedict... I'm drooling as I reminisce on the delicious in-house made hollandaise.  If you haven't checked them out, I suggest you do. It will save you loads of time on a Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the big hype is about. I'm new to Calgary (it was my first weekend) and a local friend of mine brought me here. We stood in line and I have to say the one thing I really liked about Blue Star is that they offer to bring you a drink while you're waiting. It was a nice touch. My friend and I sipped on orange juice, which was very fresh, until a table was available. The wait time was typical of a brunch place on a Saturday so no complaints there.  I ordered two eggs, chicken sausage and hash browns.  The eggs were fried crispy and the hash browns were extremely salty I could barely eat them. The chicken sausage was delicious however.   I wondered if I had picked the wrong dish. People seemed to order a bowl that had two poached eggs on top. I think that was the lamb sausage dish. That seemed popular. The salt on the potatoes though. I couldn't get past that."}
{"text":"We decided to check this little diner out, driven by this place hundreds of times, dinally stopped and had a great lunch.  I ordered French Onion Grilled Cheese - caramelized onions, gruyÃ¨re, french herbs, roasted shallot mayo on sourdough. My partner ordered the 3 Egg Omelette Lyonnaise - Caramelized onions, french herbs, gruyÃ¨re. A small salad to share. This was a great middle of the day breakfast/lunch place cozy and servers were really friendly and attentive. I upgraded my fries to dirty fries consisted of homemade cheese/gravy...Delicious! A must try."}
{"text":"Blue Star Diner is a busy little place. The tables are really close together. Super cute decor.  The food was good, not the greatest dinner I have had but it was good. I had the chicken tacos with the featured salad. Salad was great but the tacos were just okay. I found it a bit soggy and lacked the usual things that come in a taco.  The service was also just okay. I felt our server was tring to get rid of us, when all we wanted to do was have some drinks after dinner and chat. So after, we deceided to leave and go for drinks down the street so we can catch up and chat without being pestered by the waiter."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow but the food was fantastic. We sat at the bar and made conversation with the bartender. The food presentation was excellent. I got the tacos and they were so on point. I'd say make sure you are prepared to be there for at least 1.5 hours and be in no rush to leave."}
{"text":"This Diner is absolutely amazing. I've accompanied a friend here a few times, and each time we've gone, we've been greeted by a extremely friendly host (not to mention good looking Host - for all the ladies out there). If you go on a weekend, prepare to wait a good 30 40 minutes, there is a huge demand for this place \"the morning after\" or even for those early risers who want to enjoy a nice breakfast. If you go during the week you can almost be certain that you'll be walked right in and guided to a table of your choice.  If you end up waiting, you're offered a cup for Joe to wake you up and keep you warm as you wait on the street for a table to open up, or a pot of tea to tide you over also.   The interior is super cute, clean lines, nice bright tile and well lit room with a bar you can sit at or an assortment of tables scattered about. The menu items are all your typical breakfast items from classic double eggs to pancakes to french toast or Omelettes. I'm a classic Bacon and Eggs girl myself so that what I've gone for both times I've been.   The servers have the mindset to serve everyone, regardless of it being \"in their section\" or not. If you're low on coffee you can be certain to have someone asking you if you'd like more. Everyone appears happy to be there, which I believe emanates on their customers.  Bonus points to them for a Glutten Free menu and Bonus, bonus points for using fresh natural product. I highly recommend going, and will be back!!"}
{"text":"Like Dairy Lane, but in Bridgeland. More great food and service. Super busy, almost all the time."}
{"text":"We heard about this newly opened little diner while staying in Calgary for a long weekend. I'm always excited to try a new restaurant, even with a twenty minute wait to grab a table. Besides, a wait time is usually a good sign.  My friend and I both ordered the Triple Double - eggs, toast, potaotes, ham, bacon and sausage for an affordable $15. The food is fresh, doesn't taste processed, and is definitely worth the price. Our other dining mate ordered a salmon and avocado benny that was very generous on the salmon and avocado (he gave it two thumbs up).  The staff were very friendly, I loved the personal Bodum I got for my tea, and I loved that we got to drink tea and coffee while we were waiting for a seat. For such a busy place, the food came pretty fast.  Decor is bright, happy, kind of Ikea-like with a homey farm twist. Love the photos on the walls.  Would have been five stars but I got a dirty utensil. Still, I'll definitely go back next time I'm in town and I'll recommend to any of my YYC friends if they're looking for an awesome breakfast joint.  They have a lunch menu, too, that looked amazing. I think I'll definitely have to try it next time I visit."}
{"text":"I had been hearing rave reviews about this place and with having a not so great experience at my previous fave brunch place I set out to find a new favorite.  This place definitely is in the running!    I went with hubby and three friends on a weekend which apparently can cause for long waits in huge line ups.  We got there close to 11 and the wait was not too bad.  Our friend got there just before us and put our names in and we maybe waited 20 mins, but other members of the party had yet to arrive anyhow.  While waiting they served us coffee and it was quite tasty.  Once seated the service was prompt and friendly.     I couldn't decide what to eat so hubby and I split two items.  One being the stuffed french toast.  We chose the cinnamon and cream cheese one... so good.  Our second choice was the eggs benny.  I'm not a huge hash browns fan so hubby took those, but I did sample a few and they were actually very tasty!  The eggs benny were delicious of course.  I also got the fresh fruit as a side instead of hash browns.  It was your typical bowl of fresh fruit... melons, grapes, and blueberries I believe.    The portions are a good size.  I was too full that I gave hubby half my fruit.    One big plus is they support and only use local suppliers as well as credit them.  Nice!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Calgary. Amazing service, fantastic coffee and great breakfasts. I'm never shy to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is really good! There's usually a line up but that's just a Calgary thing you can't avoid. The space can get a bit crowded and warm because the tables are too close to each other. I recommend to go a bit late (after 1pm) for brunch to avoid long waits and an overly crowded space. They offer good cocktails if you like to spice things up at breakfast."}
{"text":"Food is great. Have tried the omelettes, eggs Benny, pancakes, and the French toasts. All delicious. Service is ok. I went to the bathroom while waiting to be seated and was gone maximum 2 minutes. When I came back the hostess had seated another group instead of me and I was next. Ended up having to wait another 20 minutes so that was a little annoying."}
{"text":"The diner is adorable inside. The staff is BEYOND friendly and competent. Our food came out in a timely manner and we had a great lunch!!!   We ordered the bison chilli grilled cheese and the bison burger and they were both delicious! Will be back :)!"}
{"text":"We had the Bison Niger, Amazing! Service was fast and very friendly! Nice and quiet, they kept the coffee coming!"}
{"text":"Breakfast of champs every time!  This is definitely one of my favourite breakfast locations in Calgary. Recommend getting there about an hour before you get hungry if you plan on eating past 10am, because lineups are at least 30-40min long and that will leave you enough time to order before you turn into a hungry monster. If you are happy to sit on the bar, those seats tend to open up a little faster than the tables. They serve coffee at the door while you wait which is a lovely touch. In summer you can sit outside enjoying your coffee while you wait in the sunshine.  Staff here are always friendly and never make you feel rushed which is a nice change for a busy breakfast location. Every time we come I try have a different item off the menu.  Girl friend tried the hot cereal which was delicious. Had it with warm berry compote and added hemp hearts for $2. Great size portion and very filling. She only got through half before being full so the rest of us helped her finish it off - it was that good.  Her boy had the Triple Double which was a mountain of food. Bacon was crisp, sausages tasty, eggs cooked just right.  The boy had pulled pork hash with poached eggs. Pork was soft and tender but not mushy. Great flavour to the pork. He is not a fan of onions and wasn't a problem to have them left out.  I tried one of their breakfast specials. 2x Poached eggs with salmon on top of potatoes rosti, cucumber salad on the side. The cucumbers had a tasty light dressing on them and added a crisp bite to the rest of the dish. loved the rosti and the salmon was a good size portion. Was super fill and the last couple of bites went to the table.  Have also been for lunch and tried the burgers - which you can still order at breakfast time. All of them are a taste sensation. Even tried one of the veggie burgers (cant remember which one) and loved the patti they used.  Happy to eat at this gem any time of day."}
{"text":"A cute and quaint restaurant that uses locally sourced ingredients and has various vegetarian and gluten-free options.   I came for dinner and ordered the veggie tacos with a side of yam fries. The tacos were just ok - I probably wouldn't order them again - but the yam fries were delicious! My friend had the steak frites which she couldn't stop raving about. For dessert, I had the gluten-free brownie with ice cream. It was amazing! Will definitely go back just for that dessert!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Blue Star Diner before, but I'm glad I got to visit with 3 lovely ladies. They fix a terrific vegan burger here, and I enjoyed their black bean soup. Beautiful, slightly breezy, sunny day. Three awesome, witty funny ladies to spend a late morning with. Delicious coffee and a friendly waitress. An unfamiliar hot sauce. Seeing an old friend with a mysterious lady sitting at the table behind me.   The visit ended with three warm hugs. Life is beautiful!"}
{"text":"Good, clean food.  Fair prices. Nice location in Bridgeland.  Quaint, small restaurant.  Would come back in near future, this time for a burger."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and was very impressed! Service, vibe, food was all stellar. An obviously conscious effort to find quality, fresh ingredients. I will be a regular."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about our first experience at this Diner. The service, atmosphere and especially the food is awesome! We were a big table (at seven ppl.) so we were able to try multiple menu items and share! Brussel sprouts with bacon & mustard were a big hit as an appetizer followed by the Bison Burger, Pork /w chorizo sausage burger and Dairy Lane burger with either yam fries, potato fries or black bean soup. One member of our party had gluten/lactose intolerance and ordered the chicken tacos with green salad with a special house white balsamic dressing. All of the entrees were perfectly prepared, used FRESH organic ingredients and tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"When visiting Calgary recently I told my boyfriend that I really wanted to have a Bison burger, and by the end of our trip, I hadn't met my goal. Luckily, the Blue Star Diner offers awesome burgers (Bison included) and this was where we came for our last meal.   There was a bit of a wait at the door due to arriving close to 7PM on a Friday night, but the wait was worth it (and wasn't too long, either). Servers are helpful and friendly and I really appreciated that almost 100% of the wine list is organic. A rare find!   The amibiance is great; the swinging french doors give you a peek into the kitchen activities, the bar area allows diners to chat up the staff, and tables are cozy, but not over crowded.   Now, the burger: fantastic! The condiments are in-house specialities (I assume) and really paired well with the burger. Yam fries were amazing and I loved every bite."}
{"text":"love this place. great food. love that they they locally source ingredients.  how about an albertan omelet filled with bison?"}
{"text":"Not normally a breakfast kinda girl but a friend of mine and I wanted to eat somewhere in Bridegland with a casual diner feel, somewhere we had not been before. I had driven and walked by Blue Star diner enough to know that it looked like my kind of place. Prices, no, not cheap but I have not really found ANY place in Calgary that feeds one cheaply! In ONT, we could get breakfast deals for $3.95 a person - do these places exist anymore? Anyways, I went early as there was a line up and I wanted to be a nice friend and get us a seat. The server was SO busy but had the time to greet me when he could and brought me and anyone who else in line wanted one, a coffee or tea. The diner is small and they count on quick patron turnovers to get the people in and out. Finally I was seated after about 15 minutes, my friend showed and I realised how HOT it was in the place. BUSY! My friend ordered the stuffed French Toast and she loved it, she said she would order that again. The hash browns on her plate looked so good but she was too stuffed to touch them and I refrained from stealing any of them somehow. Ha! I ordered a lunch type meal, that being the chicken club with avocado. I cut it in half right away to bring half home to my husband as he is the TRUE tester of a good club sandwich!!! I got the bean soup instead of fries and I quite liked it. $1 upgrade for that. Coffee cups never went below half without a refill from the staff and they were very accommodating, making sure that we had everything we needed. Of note - if you wish to have egg white with your meal (I originally wanted 2 fried egg whites, toast and hash browns) they will not do it unless the whites are scrambled. Ick, I passed on that, not for me. And not for any amount of money would I ever be able to choke down an egg yoke! What we did have to eat was very good and we will likely be back. Everyone else's plate in the joint looked better than the last! With tip and everything, $40. Not something I would partake in each weekend (as this cost of course did not even include a boozy drink!)  but the Blue Star Diner was what I would consider a treat. They do a great job!We left at 3:00pm and the line was still out the door! Oh and my husband gave 2 thumbs up on the half club sandwich!!!!"}
{"text":"So far so good.  A very handsome and tastefully decorated diner.  Come early or late as the place packs up quickly due to its diminutive size.  The menu is quite extensive, too, for such a small place but it offers something for everyone.  1st time here and I ordered the Huevos Rancheros...4 stars.  It's a nice twist to an old favorite.  Blue Star uses a crispy corn tostada as opposed to a toasted flour tortilla but I didn't mind cause I enjoyed the extra crunchiness to each bite.  If you're a meat lover like myself, I would recommend adding the pork or chicken sausage to the order...all of the vegetable toppings (beans, onions, peppers, etc.) tasted great but the extra protein was icing on the cake. ;)  My only complaint is that I wished there was a bit more refried beans on top of the tostada. The dish would've easily been a 5 star with freshly prepared salsa, but I understand this is a diner, after all.  The side of fried potatoes were good but nothing to holler about."}
{"text":"Amazing!. One of the best breakfast spots in the city! Eggs Benny is to die for! Love the decor in the restaurant and the service is always amazing!"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review, based on dinner this time.   We ended up heading there around 7:30ish on Friday night, and to our surprise there wasn't much of a wait. One couple in front of us and we were all sat within 10 minutes.   Everything looked soo good! I started with a peach Bellini, which was delicious and not made like most (slushy and full of sugar), it was with champagne and peach puree. For dinner I went with the gluten free spicy chirizo sausage burger and the tomato gin soup. It was amazing, some of best soup I've had and the fact that it was a gluten free tomato soup was what really sold me.   Steve went the mac & cheese, which sadly I wasn't able to have, but the review was it was great as well.   I hate that this place is always busy, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I was in the city for a visit to the hospital, but before heading home we wanted to enjoy a good breakfast of eggs Benedict. Google quickly revealed Blue Star Diner was the place to go for a variety on eggs Benedict recipes! Yelp was kind enough to rave about Blue Star Diner, so how could we go wrong?! We definitely did NOT!!!  The place is easy to miss, if you don't know that the place is rather small & the sign is flat against the building. But Google maps, has the option to go down to Street View where you can see these things as if you were walking down the street. So, we were well prepared & knew what to look for.  Inside, it's contemporary in design & quite the happening place on a Thursday morning at about 11am or so. It seemed to attract a youngish, trendy crowd. I'd say those in their 20s, 30s, or 40s. For someone with chronic pain, their seating wasn't the greatest. They have some benches & but mostly hard wooden chairs. While looking nice, they hurt. :( However, for most I'm sure they wouldn't even be an issue of note.   The diner WAS quite noisy, which made it quite hard to hear each other when trying to converse. (That's why I brought my rating down from 5*.)  I ordered eggs Benedict for breakfast. It was out of this world!!! The BEST I've EVER had!!!! They must get & use fresh, farm eggs as the yolks are a different orange colour. But the tastes of everything together... sooo good!!! And I LOVE my chunky potatoes!! Oh my, was it good!! And the price was reasonable too! (Their menu is online.) The regular eggs Benedict that they serve comes with a roasted tomato layered on it. We had it served on the side, which we rather enjoyed that way. I don't know that it would have made things soggy, but it may have had the potential to do that.  Service was excellent, even if our server was busy & another server happened by she wasn't above helping us out.   The diner is easy to get to & from, if you're traveling along highway 2.   My mouth is watering just thinking about our next trip!! Can't wait!! :D Yum!!! :D"}
{"text":"I went here with my mom on a casual Wednesday morning. The service was fast and excellent. We split the pork hash with corn bread and it was one of the best breakfasts I have had in a long time. They even put our order in two plates without asking....  My mom said that her coffee was great I found my hot chocolate to just be okay.  We didn't have to wait for a table at all but I could see a little bit of a wait on a weekend. The food makes it worth the 45 minute drive for sure."}
{"text":"I really feel like I owe this restaurant a review. I have eaten here more times than I can count and I really enjoy the quality and consistency of the food and service.   Having Celiac Disease is frankly a real pain when eating out, and I have a reasonable fear of cross contamination. Blue Star is celiac friendly, and all the staff do an excellent job in taking the treat of cross contamination seriously. I feel confident when I eat here that there will always be something delicious for me to eat, and that I will not get sick.   The menu is diverse in flavours, and everything I have tried has been delicious. Locally sourced and all Made from scratch, it is a far departure from what comes to mind when you hear the word diner. I also enjoy the atmosphere, the restaurant is small, but cozy, well designed and comfortable. The only reason I haven't given a 5 star review is because the diner doesn't take reservations, this can make for long wait times made awkward by the limited amount of space available to wait for your table. This doesn't stop me from frequenting the diner however because I really do enjoy the food and it is worth waiting for.   If you have the opportunity to eat here I would suggest the Dirty Fries (fries topped with homemade cheese sauce, caramelized onions and spring onion), the Thai butternut soup, the buttermilk chicken burger, the brussel sprouts and the vegetarian burgers are all amazing too, especially the Mediterranean burger.   The service is always fantastic."}
{"text":"Awesome casual Saturday evening dining. I had the lamb tacos and would recommend them. Everyone else had the burgers and enjoyed them. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"\"STOP IT! STOP BEING CUTE!\"  Nothing snaps you out of Sunday hungover daze like a random greeting from lovely old friends driving by. Is it me or is Blue Star the place to meet up with sweet folks? I'm 2 for 2 and I have a feeling it'll be a long streak  Blue Star still had the same cool vibe it's hot sister-Dairy Lane had, from the 10-30 minute wait for a table, to the small but bustling dining room perfect for human observation. Is it me or is Blue Star packed with couples? Quick! Let's play a game called \"did that couple\":  A. Have a romping night of \"adult pursuits\" topping the morning off with a Triple Double, hand-feeding each other bites of Blue Star's fabulous bacon.  B. Having a sad \"Friendzone\" get together were guy is eating his feelings away with a plate of Huevos Rancheros and girl is obliviously vacuuming up a vegan scramble...with a side order of Blue Star's fabulous bacon.  C. Are on the outs, criticizing each other's \"unhealthy choice\" but really are just eating the same damned thing because Bison is Bison. Also fighting over the last piece of Blue Star's fabulous bacon.  D. Are really just brother and sister. Awkward. But they are sharing a plate of Blue Star's fabulous bacon.  I had their Pesto and Guyere Veggie burger with my usual side order of avocado and grilled tomato. The Burger was refreshing but savory which was perfect after a weekend of eating brick loads of EVIL.  Our server was adorable and charming as hell. Sarah. She looked like the female Garth from Wayne's world and immediately picked out my \"GIDDY UP\" Kramer shirt. When we pointed this out, she happily chirped \"Finally someone gets me!\" . Anyone reading this review should give that girl a hug, then order some bacon."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyable.  Glad I spent an hour researching restaurants.  Great food & nice ambiance.  Local clientele.  Enjoyed braised beef with polenta & carrots plus Mac & cheese.  Red ale from the chalk board hit the spot."}
{"text":"Solid place for brunch in the area - In the area of Calgary. It doesn't really matter where you are in the city, if you're looking for a good brunch, Dairy Lane is gonna be a great pick.  Located in Bridgeland, a.k.a \"The Calgary Breakfast Belt\", running down the southern portion of Edmonton trail and along 1st Ave NE, Blue Star Diner has no shortage of competitors in the area. With OEB and Diner Deluxe nearby, you're bound to get a good meal no matter where you wind up, but while Diner Deluxe take a similar concept, they twist it with their own unique from-farm-to-table charm.  Comparatively, while OEB has some unreal breakfast, you're gonna have to wait a while and it will sort of feel like you're eating it in an (adorable) closet. Blue Star, on the other hand, while not without it's own wait times, will give you a bit more freedom to stretch your legs, chat with your friends over the tasty meal you just had and maybe order one more MANmosa for the road. Yeah, a manmosa: It's a tallboy of pilsners cut with orange juice. Rugged and surprisingly refreshing.  There are some delectable menu options but I always keep getting back to the bennies. The eggs benedicts are top notch for a city that does brunch well. What the hell do you put in your hollandaise sauce, Blue Star? Is it dreams? Love extract? What?"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Delicious food. A great community diner. We had Paul as our server, and he was amazing. Even though the place was busy, he found time to make sure we felt appreciated and that we enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"Blue Star is one of Calgary's Best Brunches.  When I lived in Calgary my wife and I would come here minimum 4 times a month. I've eaten every item in the menu, know most of the staff by name, and so here are my favorites:  - Havana Rancheros: eggs, crispy corn shells, beans, salsa, sour cream and farm fresh eggs. Fantastic.  - Blueberry Banana Pancakes - made with an egg based crape style French recipe; not the typical over fluffy box crap. Very good but if you like \"fluffy pancakes\" this isn't for you.  - Eggs Benedict - one of the best in the city. Not drenched in sauce like some places, instead well crafted delicate flavors. I love the smoked salmon and pickled asparagus.  - omelets: all great!  Dinner: - The burger is fantastic, so are the tacos, and the fries are cooked right. Ask for Sweet valentine sauce with them! It's the perfect balance of sweet and spicy but not fire hot.   What I love best is Shane's commitment to locally sourced food suppliers and his commitment to quality. There is also tons of healthy options."}
{"text":"My boss, coworker & I will go for breakfast about once a month. It was my pick, so I chose Blue Star because I'd seen it had awesome reviews on Yelp!   The restaurant is really cute. I love the atmosphere. The waitress was really friendly and helpful.   The food was EXCELLENT but the portions were pretty small.  The price was a little high, and I found they use a LOT of paprika, so if you're not into that you might not like it.  I understand the price is high because the food is locally sourced.   I will definitely be going back to try their dinner/lunch menu. I find you can't fully judge a place on their breakfast. But It was a fantastic experience overall!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were looking for somewhere other than a chain restaurant to eat at so I opened the yelp app and it pulled up the blue star. We pulled up at about 4:10 in the afternoon and went in. The kitchen was closed until 4:30pm. The menu didn't have an over abundance of choices but enough to choose from. We decided on bison burgers as we had never had them before. It was a surprisingly good first choice for somewhere we had never been. The  flavor was good. Not to strong but different from beef. The meal size was good. I had the yam fries with mine....they were awesome!!! They were moist not dryer out or over cooked with a crispy/salt style coating. So impressed! We have  decided to go back to try breakfast menu as well as lunch. Very good for a small place."}
{"text":"Coming from \"The States\", and coming to Canada for the first time in Calgary. This was my first international breakfast at this restaurant. Food was absolutely delicious. Service was quick. The server/waitress was exceptionally polite. When I come back to Calgary in the near future. I'll definitely come back here. Thank you Blue Star Diner for making my breakfast enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I am so glad we wandered into the Blue Star Diner today! There was a wait to sit inside but we opted to sit on the patio (they gave us little blankets) so we were seated right away. The service: 10/10; the menu: 10/10; hipster location and people watching: 10/10. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benny - delish! My bf ordered the heuvos rancheros - so good! The coffee is really good too; felt I need to add that! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a great Veggie Omlette. Service was fast. Everyone was very friendly. Will be back for brunch sometime"}
{"text":"Delish burger and a friendly staff--was a great stop to have lunch on our way to Banff."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in a cute neighbourhood. The waiting system is great, we were able to wander around a bit until our table was ready and arrived ready to eat after receiving our text. We ordered the eggs Benedict with salmon and avocado, stuffed French toast with cream cheese and berry compote, bison stacked sandwich and the chorizo burger. The food was tasty and the atmosphere was fun. The coffee was delicious and piping hot! Good place for a low key meal."}
{"text":"Great Service. Great Atmosphere. Decent Food.  Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  As others have mentioned, the decor here at Blue Star Diner is a standout quality, with an open kitchen style bar and servers who are as fast as they are friendly. The atmosphere is truly marvelous. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  While I didn't take a picture, my \"Triple-Double\" was a generous dish, and came in at only $16.50. Considering the plate included two types of sausage and bacon, that was a fair price. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Honestly? It was good, but not great. Outside of what were some pretty standard eggs and mediocre potatoes, the chicken and pork sausage didn't do too much for me, and the bacon was pretty seriously overcooked. My Mom did mention that her bennies were out of this world, but my experience wasn't quite what it could have been. Single Star Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Come to Blue Star Diner to check out the atmosphere, but be aware that there are better breakfasts in the city. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! Both service and food were outstanding. Must try the stuffed cinnamon and cream cheese French toast. The bread wasn't too Eggie and had a nice dry texture that was offset by the deliciously stuffed middle; which consisted of cinnamon and cream cheese and a berry compote.  Add to it a generous helping of crispy hashbrowns and you are all set for deliciousness."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and in both times, I had a great breakfast. Stuffed French toast not only looked great but tasted really great as well. It was one dish that I really enjoyed much. The interior looked great as well with a really nice vibe going on. This place could get busy and as expected, there is a wait time but for me, it was worth it."}
{"text":"The attention to detail on all fronts is exceptional... Excellent service, food, coffee, cleanliness, ambiance, and overall experience. The first restaurant that inspired me to write a review in years!"}
{"text":"Whoa, Blue Star just happened to me. See, we were just poking our heads in to see what this place was about about. Immediately the host (owner?)--a very tall solidly built young man--took charge of the situation. Our names were on the waitlist, drinks were in our hands, and we were picking food off the menu before the door even shut behind us. It wasn't even much longer before we were seated with more drinks on our table.  It was only then that I noticed how hip this small diner was: not hipster--more trendy than that.  They pack us in the diner pretty tightly, but not uncomfortably so. Service was good although we did wait a bit longer than seemed necessary for our food. When we got it, it was quite good. They love bison here, and I do too. My bison chili was lovable, although admittedly did not blow my mind. Nothing was cheap (what is in Calgary these days) but the menu wasn't unreasonable. I'm trying to see on their website how much I paid, but there is no chili listed. Best not to rely on the online menu; better just pop into Blue Star  ...although if you do, plan to stay for a while."}
{"text":"For casual brunch... this is about as good as it gets!  Always a line up, we decide to either hit Ramen Noodles, Burgers or Brunch and were in Bridgeland so went with Blue Star as our first choice. It was lined up but an approx 20 min wait rather than 40 for ramen. We were greeted in line with coffees and just hung out until we got a table. They were very helpful accomodating with my little 3year old in tow. Brought her crayons and paper when we sat and were quick with (more) drinks and our order. Our food was delivered in pretty quick time: my husband had the All In Omelette. He didnt speak for about 15 mins so Im guessing it was good. I had the  Burrito - the more Mexican one sans onion festival. It was piping hot with warm cheese throughout and not to much beans and corn. I loved it. My daughters pancake was melt in your mouth and she ate about half -its the size of a smaller dinner plate. We were all happy and noted this was a great spot - not to expensive, not to fancy and just the right about of Hip."}
{"text":"Good little breakfast place, I think my favorite is the blueberry banana pancakes. Delish and worth a try! The yogurt parfait is extremely bland but the maple syrup will help with that. Service is always good, but be prepared to wait awhile if you come any time past 9am on a weekend."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Blue Star Diner. My partner and I went there originally because Dairy Lane had a ridiculously long line, and they have basically the same menu for breakfast.   While breakfast is good, I think their dinner menu is even better. As a pescatarian, I really value places that cater to both my vegetarian and fish-eating appetites, and Blue Star is exceptional at helping a gal out. In particular, I would recommend the tacos for supper. Just remember though, they don't serve tacos until after 4:30 pm. So don't be expecting to have tacos for lunch.  As far as breakfast is concerned, I recommend the stuffed french toast with the berry compote. It has the perfect balance of tangy and sweet."}
{"text":"Have you ever returned to a good Diner to order the something you have had before? because you know its good and you have a craving and you were dreaming about it!!! Then when you show up its no longer on the menu so your just full of  udder disappointment.  This is what happened to me. I was sitting in my seat visually sadden and sulking in my booth.    None the less I was very pleased with service here and everything on the menu is yummy so I still let satisfied and with a smile on my face.   Tip: This is not just a brunch place I know they are always lined up for bunch but the dinner menu is equally as tasty."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  Once for breakfast and a couple of other times for dinner.  I like it !  There are 15 or so tables with room at the bar.  Not an overly large place and luckily I haven't had to wait as it appears that other reviewers have had to do.    Every time I've been in, service has always been very friendly and honest.  Servers are attentive, but not overbearing.    The menu is rather limited at dinner, with only a handful of different burgers, tacos and a couple of other mains.  I've only ever had a burger and each time the burger was done perfectly. Cooked thoroughly, but still juicy.  Fries were also awesome !   The atmosphere of the Blue Star is clean, open and white.  Kind of reminds me of what a beach house interior should look like, and I'm not saying that in a bad way.  Due to the openness of the place, it can be a bit loud when the restaurant is full.  There is always some really good music playing as well.    The selection of wines, beer and other spirits is quite good considering the size of the restaurant.  The quality of the wines on the menu is also very good, and not at exorbitant prices.    Overall, I like this place and will be going back."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar, I wasn't hungry enough to go all out as much as I'd liked to.   I went for the classic 2 eggs, hashbrowns and toast. Added chicken sausage to it for s*its and giggles. Nummy. The eggs were a bit dry and overcooked. Shame. The rest was bang on. Tasty sausage, fresh 'browns, and good toast. Me likey likey.  The food is a bit pricey on the breakfast side, but their board showing local suppliers makes the extra hit worthwhile.  Overall I would go back in a heartbeat. It would be a weekend since I enjoy parking in the lawyer's spots. Blue Star is always busy for these reasons of good food. The owner is fun and fast to seat and/or put you on the waiting list. The server was constantly back refilling drinks. I truly appreciate when owners work like he did, pouring coffees, juices, waters etc. Great people. Good food. Fun place for all and family friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of breakfast foods but I could eat them every day if they were cooked at this diner.   When we arrived the diner was full but we only had a short five min wait for a table. The restaurant is small and yet it has a very comfortable and light feel to it. There are pictures of food on the walls which is always nice in a restaurant. They have a black board with where all their ingredients from Alberta listed. I was impressed by this. I love to support businesses with local  background and supplies.   I absolutely love tea and I drink it all the time. I was pleasantly surprised to be offered sweetened or unsweetened ice tea. Ice tea made to order is to die for. The blue star diner sweetened ice tea was really tasty.   I ordered the salmon Benedict and it was very flavorful. You could tell it was made with fresh organic ingredients. My one big complaint was with the eggs. They asked me specifically if I wanted soft or hard poached eggs. I was very clear that I like mine as soft as possible. When my breakfast arrived the eggs were very over cooked. Still my dish was delicious. Had my egg yolks broken as they should have the dish would have been perfection.   My second favorite part of my dish was the potatoes. They were crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle and seasoned perfectly. Also they put some fresh tarragon over the potatoes.   My experience at this diner was fun and filling. The service was a little slow with regards to the breakfast but well worth the wait.  This diner is a diamond in the rough. If you are looking for a delicious and fresh meal then this is the place. I am excited thinking about the next time I try a dish at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Blue Star diner is one of my favorite places to visit when I'm in Calgary. Their burgers are absolutely delicious, the wings are to die for, they always have fresh, local and organic ingredients, and we have always had nothing but top-notch service. Don't even get me started on breakfast! I have never been disappointed with this restaurant and always look forward to visiting a few times a year."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and I've been hearing about the Blue Star Diner since it opened, so I knew I had to make a visit. Last weekend we got up to watch/photograph the sunrise so I figured a stop for a nice breakfast was the perfect idea.  At 8am-ish parking wasn't really an issue... we got a spot on the street right outside the restaurant. Similarly, only about half the tables were taken so we got seated immediately. Everyone was nice & friendly, water served right away (and bottle left on the table, which I love) and coffee was good.   I had the tomato & basil omelette and it was divine. A perfect mixture of everything and very tasty. The potatoes were also cooked to perfection and I very much enjoyed the (sourdough) bread and what appeared to be homemade jam. Yum! My dining partner had the blueberry banana pancakes and, although not a whole wheat fan, thought they were delicious - the whole wheat was not overpowering at all.   All in all, I'll definitely be back (I like to walk my dog on Tom Campbell's Hill!) and would recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in for an early dinner at 4:45PM before a 6PM commitment, so we were in a bit of a rush and shared from the feature menu: tako (octopus) tacos and the shrimp and grits. He started on a goulash with star anise, and he said it was delicious. We shared a meringue-topped sundae at the end. Service was superb."}
{"text":"really like it here, definitely in my list of regular places to visit. Good burgers, great fries (shoe string style with rock salt) and for some reason, tacos seem to be a specialty... don't get me wrong, they are really good but an unexpected chapter in the menu of a local diner :)  My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that they only keep 2 beers on tap... although, they have an extensive bar and a long list of bottled beers."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the first time I had the smoked salmon and avocado eggs Benedict and it was phenomenal!! I got a side order of the Spulumbo chicken sausage  as well, but in all honesty it left something to be desired so you can probably skip out on that.   The second time I came I ordered the huevos rancheros with spolumbo chicken sausage again, but it was cut up and mixed in with everything...this is the reason I brought the rating to 4 - It wasn't bad, but it wasn't delicious either...I should have stuck to the Benny...  The Coffee, as an aside, is excellent!"}
{"text":"I loved that place, nice food and amazing service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Hoping to go back soon! My taste buds are tingling!"}
{"text":"It's really an overpriced breakfast, brunch, dinner joint. I took my son here and I got him the banana blueberry pancake and it was huge. It was yummy. As for why people wait hours on end on the weekends is beyond me. I suppose anything that offers brunch is golden on Calgary and all it takes is the name with \"Diner\" at the end of it to bring in the customers."}
{"text":"My go to in any city is an original diner, sometimes upscale, which uses local ingredients to create a unique twist on diner favourites.   The Blue Star Diner is one of these places.  From the great atmosphere and decor to the friendly service.    We went to the diner for a late dinner.  Only one other table was seated which was to be expected at 845 pm on a Sunday night.   From the minute we walked in the door, we were made to feel welcome. The service was quick and the sever was very helpful in explaining the menu.   The kids in our party had nachos to share which is a very large plate.  Even after eating we still had a large to-go box.    One of our group ordered the chicken vegetable soup with yam fries. They were very impressed.  Good size bowl of soup and plenty of tasty yam fries.   Another ordered the Bison and regular fires. The burger was devoured quickly with little discussion. It was clear that the burger was a big hit.   I ordered the Alberta beef and pork meatloaf wrapped in Hutterite bacon topped with home made spicy BBQ sauce with slaw and an arugula salad.  The meatloaf is served in two medallion sized pieces. The portion size is not big however that is what I was looking for.  The meatloaf was excellent with a combination of flavours. The BBQ sauce was tangy with spice and a hint of mustard seed.  Excellent combination. I would  order this again.   Overall an excellent experience.  The decor is simply yet elegant, the service was excellent and the food was excellent with a twist on diner favourites.  Really enjoy that this diner choses to support local farmers.   Would highly recommend eating here if you are in Calgary."}
{"text":"We've tried to get into this restaurant a few times in the past year, but it's always busy. And with good reason. The restaurant is tiny and the food is really, really good.  We showed up early (11:30am) on a Friday and had about a 15 minute wait. That was doable especially since it was darn cold outside and room for us to wait inside. We sat at the bar and enjoyed a late breakfast or I guess you could say brunch.  Since I'm on a Huevos Rancheros kick these days, and find every where I go they are made slightly different, I decided to give them a whirl. I was not disappointed. Delicately piled on a crispy corn tortilla, topped with all kinds of goodness, black bean salsa and a couple eggs they were exactly what I was looking for.  My date had a simple meal of eggs with toast and a fruit salad. Equally delicious. Friendly staff, enjoyable outing. The only con is how small it is inside, but definitely not a deterrent."}
{"text":"They don't take Amex and they should! They would get 4 stars but I'm a married to my Ex card so I'm taking a star away from this place because they have the opportunity to earn it back.    Food was great, original and fun.  The service was good and the ambiance 'local'.  The chorizo burger was outstanding on a GF bun, stunningly delicious and the fries plenty.  The room was hipster playful full of young energy."}
{"text":"One of my best friends took me here for my birthday breakfast this year...and let me just say that it was actually some of the best breakfast food I've ever had...like ever!  I actually melted all over my chair eating. I could barely even work that afternoon.   I went back about a month later and actually fell asleep on the way home (not sure if that a 100% good thing lol)  I'm simply in love with this place, the atmosphere is cool and trendy, the staff is super friendly and the food....let me put it this way, if i was a plate of food and was looking for a spouse i'd definitely try and pick me up a sultry plate of food from Blue Star Diner!  I'm in love, the starry eyed kind."}
{"text":"This was a great breakfast choice! The food was delicious! I had the cinnamon cream cheese stuffed French toast and a bowl of fruit. Both were delicious. The service was outstanding..it's a super cute place!"}
{"text":"We went there for brunch on a Saturday. I had read a lot of good reviews about this place, the brunch experience was good, but it wasn't exceptional.  I enjoyed the food, and couldn't find anything wrong with the service either. The staff were friendly and the environment was warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"There's a chalkboard on the wall with an array of their suppliers which is really great for us folks who care about that.  The space is so neat and clean, it really reflects the food served: just light, bright and tasty!"}
{"text":"Finally got to see what the hype was about and have breakfast at Blue Star Diner! After a sweaty workout on the Crescent Heights stairs, Missy D. and I headed over here for some grub. It was less busy than we anticipated, after a short wait we were seated right away. Our server was quiet and slightly awkward, we ordered two Pink Mimosas and Eggs Benny (I had the smoked salmon & avocado...delish!). I was really impressed and ate every bite on my plate. For two people, the price was a bit steep for breakfast (although the drinks were likely the culprit), but the food was really tasty and the place itself was really cute. I'll definitely be returning and bringing my bf next time."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for brunch. Had eggs Benedict with everything but salmon and avocado...... Wow. They were kind enough to give me a certificate of recognition for my customized order :-D back here today for more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this diner in the heart of Bridgeland! Great food and service. Love that they take part in Meal Share!"}
{"text":"After reading Angelo's review, I was pretty determined that I wasn't going to come as a couple. It was kind of hard to not hand feed my s/o either. He has trouble getting things into his face without assistance. (incase you are reading this, I am totally kidding, please don't be mad at me).  Boy. was that a mistake. You want a table for more than 2? 5, you say?!?!?!? Well you will have to wait. and wait. and wait. and wait.   Server kept us pretty entertained by topping off our coffees and the \"keep staring\" game plan.  40 minutes and 2 cups of coffee later....we get a table. We're pretty hopped up on java. We need something in our systems that will dilute our blood caffeine levels. Thank goodness the portion sizes are hearty. Not Nellie's type of hearty, but just a tad less than coma hearty.   I'm simple.  I want eggs, toast, bacon, sausage. I want the bacon crispy, sausage juicy, eggs perfect, toast warm at arrival.  Water, juice, condiments plentiful and topped up. I want to pick at everyone else's dishes, steal some fries and have enough ketchup to feed a small village.  But enough abou me. Boyfriend had the Huevos Rancheros, and inhaled it fast enough to report that it was just \"ok.\" I suspect he was downplaying the deliciousness to excuse himself from forgetting to share.  Brothers each got the bison and lamb burger. Typical, man breakfast, right? Inhaled that pretty fast too. So I'm guessing those were delicious as well. Came with a good helping of fries.  Blue star sure isn't in the business of disappointment. No sir.  Long wait? Sure. Awesome food? Oh yes.  Review #3 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"One star, two star... red star... BLUE STAR!! Of *course* a Dr. Seuss reference works for this place. You're going to think of it now every time you head on over to Blue Star, right? ;)  I popped in for lunch with a colleague on Tuesday. Well, technically we both ate breakfast, so I guess it was brunch. But I always think of brunch as something that happens before noon, not right around noon. Although, I'm pretty sure we ordered before noon... no matter. Brunch!  The menu was plenty full of options, and I had difficulty trying to decide what to eat, but eventually landed on the back bacon and tomato eggs benny. Yum yum! Served with hash browns and plenty of sauce on those eggs, it filled me up in no time.  Decor is bright and super cute, I can imagine this is a busy spot on the weekends. Service was prompt and friendly... yet another great breakfasty diner place to try out in the neighbourhood.  Oh, and for you gluten free folk, easy peazy to sub out for GF substitutes!"}
{"text":"Really great food, super friendly service, and a quick seating after being turned away from another restaurant a block away with a 2 hour wait. It can't be two hours better than this place! Loved the stuffed French toast."}
{"text":"Had breaky here and it was busy as expected but we got a table pretty quick. They are a well oiled machine haha. I was debating between eggs benedict and pulled pork hash... I got the pulled pork hash and though it was good, it was very oily/greasy especially near the bottom.   Will definitely come back and try more items. Breakfast/lunch/or dinner."}
{"text":"Had a 1st Avenue burger with skinny fries which was fantastic last night!  Thick cut Bacon, caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato and hold the cheese. Yup, still 4 stars! Service was attentive and pleasant. We arrived early and the place filled quickly.   Had a lovely dinner tonight. Very good service with a casual bistro feel. Steak frites for me. Love kennebec skinny fries! Steak was a bit overcooked but tasty with the onions and roasted tomatoes under it. My hubby had a green salad with chicken breast. They forgot the chicken so it came after his salad was finished and our waitress took the chicken off our bill which was very nice. Our son had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. I had a taste and it was the bomb!!!!  Omg- I can't wait to return to have it myself . Shallot aioli, lettuce, tomato, perfectly seasoned chicken breast. I rarely am impressed by chicken but they did an amazing job!!! Prices are reasonable for the quality and service provided.   We were too full to attempt dessert.  I also noticed a burger place directly across the street. Will check that out soon!"}
{"text":"Coffee is my favourite, breakfast burrito is good and pancakes are okay close to my work"}
{"text":"I was super hungry one morning so I asked my gf if she wanted to go out for brunch.  She had just finished running a half marathon while I was lying in bed.......she was down for a meal and I was debating between a few places when I remembered I had Blue Star Diner bookmarked for a long time.  Blue Star Diner is located just off Edmonton Trail on 1st Avenue in the NE.    We went around 11:15AM on a Saturday; you have to pay for street parking although, I believe you can park right in front of the diner for 2 hours.  Anna arrived first and told me it was a 45 minute wait.  We decided to wait because the wait was so long; we figured it must be worth it!  While waiting it was getting hot so the lady popped open the window.  I eyed up the surroundings.  There is a bar right when you walk in with 8 bar stools and a nice open area for the bartender.  The dining area has maybe 11 tables of a mixture of two tops and four tops; it's a very homey and cozy environment.  We got seated at a two top table and were handed menus.  Our server recommended the eggs benny or some vegetarian dish.  I decided to go with the bacon and grilled tomato eggs benny and a side of French toast and Anna went with the breakfast p.l.t which was crispy pork belly, gull valley tomato, organic baby arugula, poached egg all on top of gluten free corn bread topped with hollandaise.  It didn't take too long for our orders to arrive; both the dishes came with hash browns.  I dug right into my French toast as I was majorly craving it.  I enjoyed it....the French toast was crispy on the outside and had a soft inside but it was quite pricey for one piece at $4.  My eggs benny was good, I cut the egg and the yolk went all over the English muffin ...MMMM!!  Anna enjoyed her breakfast special but she had wished that there was more hollandaise sauce.  We both mentioned that we would have liked if the hash browns were crispier as they were a little soggy but the seasoning was great.  Overall, Blue Star Diner has prices above the average breakfast but it's a place to try at least once.  Their menu categories consist of classic breakfast, bennies, omelettes, burritos, sides, soup, salads, veggie burgers, Sylvan star grilled cheese, burgers, breakfast cocktails, beer, coffee, tea, and beverages.  I will definitley pay another visit and try something else!"}
{"text":"You know, I wasn't too sure about you and your tofu scram for awhile, Blue Star. I'm still not, and I noticed that the same scram you serve for breakfast is also on your dinner menu which is unnerving. IT'S JUST A STIR FRY. FEED THE VEGANS SOMETHING ELSE MORE INNOVATIVE FOR BREAKFAST PLEASE AND THANKS.  What has changed my mind and caused me to update my review with an extra star? Well, I recently visited you guys for dinner, and had things that I actually really liked. Firstly, we visited you on a busy Saturday, but got a table faster than we would have at the Coup which was my first choice, so that was nice. I ordered the vegan black bean burger with yam fries. I was promptly asked by my server if I was vegan. I said yes. She warned me that the fries at Blue Star are cooked in the same oil as their fish. Gross. I switched to salad. Kind of bums me out because it would seemingly be an easy fix and allow a couple more options of sides for those who don't like their yams touching meat, but I'm grateful to have been told.   The burger was tasty, although it seems to me they actually just put black beans and corn on top of the patty? I wasn't sure. The bun was great, and the vegetables tasted fresh. The avocado wasn't even a bit brown. My accompanying salad was good too, and included all sorts of mystery things like strawberries. While the price seemed a little steep for my veggie burger and a handful of salad, everything tasted fresh and of quality. Also enjoyed a bottle of Wild Rose Wraspberry along with my meal.   Solid 4 stars, but wish you were a weeeee bit more vegan friendly."}
{"text":"The dinner meal here was really mediocre. My sweet potato fries were insanely over cooked and I'm not one to complain about food. The burger was decent. The service was alright but not great. Perhaps it was just my waitress a the time having a bad day. I bet their breakfast is a lot better."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally grab a bite here today, as I've heard so much about it.  I love the atmosphere - clean, simple decor and bright.  Even the restrooms are nice.  It's a busy place and I was lucky enough to avoid standing in line by arriving at 11am.    I could have eaten super healthy but really, the point of going to new places is to try something that I wouldn't normally eat at home, if you ask me.  I ordered the Sylvan Star Grilled Cheese Bison Stacker.  That is one big sandwich.  I could barely fit the three sourdough bread slices high with cheese and Bison chili in my mouth.  Crust crumbs were flying everywhere.  It was just the nature of the beast and my napkin was well used.  The home-cut fries that accompanied it reminded me of the old school KFC fries - floppy and salty.  They were good but my conscience wouldn't let me order them again.  Overall, the sandwich was good while it was fresh.  However, I took half home as leftovers and it's just not the same.  I wouldn't recommend doing this.  A sandwich that is one part soggy and one part dry and crusty is no longer a party in my mouth.  For those who order this, I say eat the whole thing or leave it behind if you can't finish it.  Also, if you aren't a big fan of salty food, don't order this menu option.    Overall, my meal was average and seemed a bit pricey for the quality.  If I go back, I'll likely try a salad or the bison chili on its own.  I'll also avoid prime brunch hours at all costs."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and love it more every visit. Great food. And if you have picky eaters in your group, you'll find something for everybody, including vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options. The staff are always super swell. The only downside is this place is small and there is often a wait for a table during prime dinner hours. But if you go after 8pm, you usually won't have a problem."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to hang here last night for dinner with my daughter. The service was very casual and friendly, not intrusive. Diner atmosphere is evident with lots of seating.   I had the burger and they did a great job of making it keto friendly. Burger was delicious and served with a generous portion of spring salad.   Overall this place is great and has a nice vibe to it, very relaxed. Price point is a bit high compared to other locales of the same genre."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this extraordinary brunch experience 5 stars is parking is difficult as it's only on the street and it can be quite a wait to get in due to the popularity of the restaurant. I also did wait a bit for my food however,  I can tell you it was well worth the wait all around. Initially I wanted to visit Dairy Lane the sister restaurant to Blue Star Diner however, the wait was even longer. BlueStar also has a full Liquor Bar which I don't believe Dairy Lane does. I can't really speak highly enough of the hospitality and service. Alex who greeted me at the door was friendly and warm and welcoming and even offered me a cup of coffee while I wait. I sat at the bar as I'm dining alone and Megan probably took care of me. I decided to have a mimosa they're $5 all the time and you get your choice of OJ ,mango ,and or grapefruit. I decided to go with the mango and it was quite delicious. The coffee is free trade and brewed specifically for the restaurant and really quite good for a more medium-bodied roast. There were many craft specialties of breakfast and brunch favorites. It came down to the Alberta Lamb hash and or the Barbecue Jackfruit and Sweet Potato Hash. As my appetite was as big as I am this morning I decided to go with the Alberta lamb hash. Absolutely delicious! Soft poached egg on top( you can also get it medium), veggies including cucumber , potatoes ,and corned lamb with a side of homemade cornbread made this dish 10 out of 10 Stars. My advice is take a rideshare here if you can and bring something to read and don't forget your appetite. Be sure to tell Alex or Megan Big John sent you... In the words of my former Governor I'll be back."}
{"text":"They serve upscale breakfast, lunch and dinner in a nice environment and aren't pretentious about it.  They're consistent and the food is great.  Dishes are $16-25.  FYI:  if anybody says \"You HAVE to go to Diner Deluxe\" don't, go to this place instead."}
{"text":"The name for the restaurant is a bit misleading. While a great breakfast restaurant, it certainly is not a diner. Prices a tad high compared to Diner Deluxe and the menu a tad uncreative compared to OEB."}
{"text":"Yummy place. I have been there once and loved it. The coffee is soo good. The staff were friendly and inviting. I will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"Was there for breakfast and had the pancakes with the extra toppings. It was super delicious, the pancakes were fluffy and a good size. $3 to top it with Nutella, fruit, and creme anglaise was definitely worth it, it made the pancake soooo much yummier.   I was there with a girlfriend and we both brought our little ones. Despite the line up, I did not feel like I was being rushed to leave, which is very rare at these types of diners. I was impressed with this and how family friendly this place was. I would definitely recommend this for families with kids."}
{"text":"This trendy little diner serves pretty good food. Places like this are common in large cities. It's nice to have it here in Calgary. Compared to other diners of this kind, perhaps in Montreal, this place is ok. Perhaps it's expensive for what you get? Acceptable. I've been here about three times and each time... it was good. The ambiance is hipster/trendy and that's fine. I had a steak once that was fine. I got the option to have a gluten free bun one time, that was good. But they got the order wrong for a person I sat with once and I remember being very impressed my first time but then less impressed the more I went. Not for kids - noise travels and the place is small and generally packed."}
{"text":"I recently spent a few days in Calgary visiting family and after a quick Yelp search had suggested checking out BSD for brunch.  Our group consisted of a vegan, a vegetarian and an omnivore...  It can be incredibly difficult to find a dining establishment that can cater to all three diets and BSD does just that fantastically.  They have a good variety of meat based, vegetarian and vegan dishes, including some with options to make them either vegan or gluten free as well.  I ordered a veganized \"BSD Veggie Burger\" and it was divine.  The veggie patty was, by far, the best I have ever tasted.  It was moist, perfectly seasoned and seared beautifully on both sides.  My group also enjoyed their food quite a bit, although, I was so concentrated on how awesome my dish was that I couldn't really tell you what they ordered.  At one point, however, my husband insisted on making people try bits of his meal so it must have been good.  Haha.  The service was AWESOME.  Not only were the staff very nice and accommodating, they were very attentive and on the ball as well.  I had ordered my burger with yam fries and a different server, a person I had not yet seen at that point, brought my food out to me when it was ready.  Before she had finished setting it down she was already asking, \"You ordered your burger your burger with no dairy products, there is mayo in the aioli served with the yam fries.  Should I take this away?\".  Before I could even reply my server came running over to us saying, \"Don't eat that! It has mayo!\", swiped it away and swapped it out with a vegan dipping sauce she already had ready in her hands.  This kind of fantastic service is amazing and hard to come by.  So yeah.  Beautiful decor, great menu selection and awesome service.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim when Starbucks was closed for renovations. We were immediately greeted and seated. The service was excellent.  My husband and I both had tacos and they were both excellent."}
{"text":"After coming here 3 times and leaving because the waiting time was too long... I could finally make it!!!... And I have to say, now I understand why is always so busy!.. The place is really good!.. The eggs Benedict are delicious!.. And there are some other breakfast I saw, that I would like to try... I would recommend the owners to consider make the place a little bigger, as the waiting line is always so long, that they might be losing a lot of customers, just because they don't like waiting.. Well... Who likes waiting?.. But other than that I have to say, that I really enjoyed this place, and I hope I can catch it again without a huge waiting line, so I can try other items in their menu..."}
{"text":"First time dining here. The salmon and avocado egg Benedict wasn't as delicious as I imagined. The roasted potatoes on the side was delicious. However the salmon slices weren't as fresh, and the English muffin bread seemed a little stale. Personally i think Diary Lane's egg Benedict was better.   I would come back again and try other things on their menu though! :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots for consistently delicious and fresh food. The veggie burger options are unrivaled in my opinion (3 options, yes please)! Nice vibe, it can go from very quiet to very busy depending on flow, even if you go for a lunch at 2pm. You never feel rushed though :) Great brunch and high quality ingredients for all of their dishes too."}
{"text":"The blue star is an exceptional place. I went with my partner and we both loved our food.   I ordered an old fashioned to drink, which was delicious and she got a glass of the Malbec-- also yummy. For dinner, I got the bison burger and regular fries which was honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had. She got the vegan scramble and she said it was \"oh my god. The curry sauce was the best curry I've ever had. And all the veggies in it were so unique. I would never picture sun-dried tomatoes with curry. It was so good\". For dessert we had the peaches and cream. Honestly, one of the simplest and best desserts we've ever had.   We would like to describe this establishment with 3 words:  - divine: we felt like the food was such a treat. We felt like we were spoiling ourselves.  - pure: the blue star diner partners with meal share, they are cognizant of people's diets, and they honestly care about their food.  - good: the people who made our food and waited on us were so kind and funny and nice. So glad to have stopped by here on our trip.   Love,  Sam & Chelsea"}
{"text":"After searching for a breakfast place for an hour, we stumbled on the Blue Star. The wait wasnt too bad. They offer to call you when your table is ready, so you can wander around or go grab a coffee somewhere!  There menu is quite large and full of items (breakfast and lunch) that give you many reasons to go back. Service was great and staff were friendly. I had the Eggs Benny with back bacon and grilled tomoato...So. Damn. Good. The hashbrowns were a bit too salty, but to each there own. And my egg was cooked perfectly. There's nothing I hate more than a slimey egg!  My only \"complaint\" (its not really a complaint) is no cappuccino or latte's available."}
{"text":"Very charming diner, with nautical blue and white decor. The inventive menu emphasizes vegan and vegetarian options. I really enjoyed my veggie burger with shoestring fries."}
{"text":"Really cute modern little place. A short lineup to get in but worth the wait. Was offered coffee or tea at the door to wait and was seated within 10 minutes. Benny was delicious and hashbrowns were just right. Staff and service were attentive and friendly. My coffee cup was never empty! Will definately be going back as there looked to be many other great menu options."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place... So much that I don't mind the super long wait times. That vegan scramble... Oh that vegan scramble, I dream of that vegan scramble. It's so delicious! I love how they have a bunch of vegetarian options.   The service is always super nice! The environment is also super crisp and clean.  Love blue star, just wish I was the only one that knew about it lol juuust kiddin!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Quick and fast!  This is the sister restaurant to Dairy Lane.  We ordered:  - Stuffed French Toast - Savoury - So good! - Brisket and Grits - Comfort food on a cold day!  Those sunny side eggs did me in!   - Lyonnaise Omelette - Yummy!  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for a few years now, and have watched staff come and go.  Even with these changes they still produce great food and their staff are still some of the best in Calgary.   I can't say enough about Blue Star, and felt it was about time to review it again. Especially since we have had so much trouble finding a resturant that takes some pride in the food it delivers to it's customers, and the level of service that it provides.  Blue Star is our favorite restaurant and makes the best burger I have eaten.  And they do it consitently without fail every time we drop in. If you have yet to try the chorizo pork burger, do youself a flavor.  Watch you don't burn your fingers.  Bon AppÃ©tit  ps: Remember to order the fries, they are equally amazing, and who has a burger without fries anyway :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast in Calgary continues to impress me, this small but refreshing joint being the latest addition to the 'must go', 'holy crap that was incredible' spots to eat away a late night induced headache.  Everything is done right: friendly and attentive staff, relaxing decor and well organized seating space with bar area, a menu that takes chances while keeping staples in reach for those who want to keep it simple, and my god the coffee was fantastic.  The pulled pork chipotle with poached eggs jumped out at me, odd because I never get something like this for breakfast.  It did not disappoint, was one of the tastiest and flavorful dishes I have had for breakfast in years.  The poached eggs sit on top of a mountain of pulled pork, yams, and peppers which are stewing in the chipotle flavored sauce in the bowl - guarding the sides of the bowl are two pieces of delicious cornbread which I imagine were freshly made.  I enjoyed this treat with a 'mall rat', which is an adult (vodka) creamsicle like drink that could be dangerous if I came on a Saturday morning (feel like I could have 10 of these).  Also got an omelette which was packed with meat and veggies, and a side pancake that despite not requesting came with blueberries and banana (sweet!).  Yea and as for the coffee, waiter said they don't bother with espresso or other drinks, just focused on getting great coffee - mission accomplished.  I enjoyed my takeaway at home while in a lovely food coma."}
{"text":"So freaking delicious, I can't wait to go back for more!  Previously I had the eggs benny which was delicious, however I thought I would try the Huevos rancheros  on the waitress' suggestion between the two and I am so glad I did it was the best breakfast I have ever had :) Plus, they gave me a to go cup for the rest of my coffee as it was so good I didn't want to leave it behind!"}
{"text":"I knew this was a 5 star place after two bites of my unforgettably delicious lamb burger. Even just thinking about this makes my mouth salivate!  My boyfriend and I were in Calgary for the Victoria   Day long weekend. We were looking for a brunch place. Most restaurants were closed for the holiday Monday. Luckily, this place was open.  There was a long lineup to get into this place. They gave us an estimated 30-45 minute wait time but we only ended up only waiting 20 minutes. By the time we were seated we decided to order lunch instead of breakfast.  I chose the lamb burger. I love lamb and I love burgers so this was an easy decision to make. This burger looks unassuming BUT the TASTE! OMG! I inhaled this burger. I'm not even sure if I breathed at all. Every bite was jam packed with flavor. There was no weird gamey taste. The meat was cooked perfectly - tender and extremely juicy. There was also some tasty feta and tzatziki in there. YUMMY!!  The side of fries was also quite tasty. Thinly cut, crispy and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend asked for a side of sweet pepper aioli to dip the fries in. I'm so glad he asked. This took my meal to another level of awesome.   Try this place out! The food here is delicious! Next time I'm in Calgary I'll come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Great recommendation! We tried the triple double, the ham and tomato benny and the two eggs. Service was excellent and the vibe was very relaxed and comfortable. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Another fine breakfast diner in downtown Calgary. Friendly staff, extensive breakfast menu and great atmosphere. I had the brisket and polenta with sunny side up eggs. Super! The burger with fries was also nicely done. The eggs with marinated lamb was very tasty. Highly recommended for all the right reasons. Bootcamp Breakfast Club (BBC)."}
{"text":"One of the best places for amazing people. They make you laugh, they make you feel welcome and energetic.  And the food is unbelievable. I usually start craving the chicken taco things with the yam fries... MMMMMM Thank you!"}
{"text":"If you are the type of person who likes delicious, local, and savoury food this is the place for you. If you do not like this kinda thing then don't go here."}
{"text":"I love that they offer txt service, so if it is a bit of a wait you can go take a walk. They have enough things on the menu I don't find myself always having the same thing and I haven't been disspointed by anything I've tried"}
