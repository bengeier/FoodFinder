{"text":"I found this restaurant through yelp. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. It was just under $20/person including tax and tips (it depends what you ordered of course). When you sit down at the table they give you a pot of green tea. The setting is nice and comfortable. The presentation of the food is fancy. 

My boyfriend and I shared the 15 piece sashimi dinner, Tobiko roll (2 pieces) and the spicy salmon roll. The sashimi dinner came with miso soup, salad and dessert. 

We will be returning again for sure."}
{"text":"Very impressed for this Chinese owned Japanese restaurant in the Markham/Richmond Hill area. The sashimis were very fresh and service was attentive. The price is not cheap, but I think the dishes were priced adequately due to freshness of everything. I usually don't like sushi rolls, but their spider rolls were done spectacularly. The omakase sashimi platter was delicious! Highly recommended Japanese restaurant in the area for fresh sashimi."}
{"text":"Got their katsudon, for a bit over $10. Which I thought was actually very worth since the portion size was very generous. The food was really good and the Katsudon was definitely very high in quality and well made. I wouldn't say it was one of the best katsudons I've had but is well worth it and still very delicious. Next time I am planning to get their katsu curry, overall the food, atmosphere and service was great."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. The owner Raymond knows nothing about customer satisfaction. If you want below average quality at a expensive price severed with a full cup of poor service, go ahead and try it....."}
{"text":"Walked in on Saturday with a friend. We ordered the sashimi moriawase, botan ebi sashimi, a spider roll, grilled salmon belly, skewers of quail eggs wrapped in bacon and skewers of grilled ox tongue. 

The moriawase we got had 2-3 pieces each of amaebi, salmon. maguro, white tuna, hamachi, and mackerel. Everything tasted pretty fresh and I remember hearing that they made their soy sauce in house which is a nice touch.

The salmon belly was my favourite dish of the night. It was perfectly cooked and deliciously juicy. Spider roll was above average in terms of taste. The quail eggs and bacon reminded me of a hearty breakfast and the tongue was very flavourful but a bit chewy. A small dessert of ice cream was complimentary as well.

The presentation is a lot better than most places. They have a daily specials board for things such as whole filleted fresh fish, otoro, live uni, whatever fish they might have in that week.

I really do wish this wasn't so far away from me. Eating dinner often enough here wouldn't be too prudent for the wallet but their lunch deals are pretty affordable for the quality of food. 

For those that may find this notable, this establishment is chinese run but is a exception in both quality and taste from the lamentably true stereotype of chinese sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"OVERRATED! 

Upon much research on this restaurant, I have finally decided to come here with a friend for lunch (with higher expectations than normal due to the great reviews). The arrival greeting and overall environment is pretty and inviting. After we've order 2 lunch specials ($17.99 x 2 for a bento box and sushi sashimi platter) , the side dishes of soup and salad came immediately, we continued our conversation while anticipating for yummy foods. 

It was not until roughly 30 minutes into our conversations that we noticed we still haven't received our meals yet. Totally understand that it is lunch hour and they are getting busy, we finally got our meals in about roughly 40 minutes but we got them separately so I was watching my friend eat for a bit. 

The food wasn't bad... All I can say is that there are definitely better Japanese restaurants with more reasonable prices around the area. If you have not been to a legit Japanese restaurant and that you've got the money to blow, this is a great place to be."}
{"text":"Very good, but very expensive. Not much variety in the sushi & maki menu. 
We came out at $40/pers for an ordinary quantity and meal (no alcohol, tip tx incl)"}
{"text":"There lunch specials are pretty good. Especially the soup + salad + 6pc sushi + shrimp and veggie tempura + miso ramen + desert combo all for just $10!!!

The dish ware is really nice too. Makes it more upscale feel and it is clean too. Just be sure to get in by 3:30. they are close in btw lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! What a wonderful experience. I was very impressed by the presentation and freshness of the sushi. If you want to have an authentic sushi experience this is the place."}
{"text":"I found Inatei through Yelp and has been going here for almost a year.  The quality of the food is consistently excellent.  Depend on what you order, it could get pricy.  My partner can't eat raw fish, so it's good that they have plenty of other dishes to choose from.  For two people, our bill with tips is around $45-55.  I don't like their soup noodles but I love their Spider Roll. And the complimentary pudding dessert is a very light and refreshing touch to a good meal."}
{"text":"Thanks for Yelpers' advise.  I checked out Inatei last Friday night.  

Grilled Black Cod was indeed good.

My hubby order the Daily picks with a variety of fresh fish, not bad for $33.  At least we don't have to travel far next time we want some unique sashimi.  

Do stay away from their deep fried ice cream, not that great."}
{"text":"Lunch combos are good.
Great quality and right portions.
Who needs AYCE?!!  It should be quality, not quantity.

Now if prices can come down bit, I'd be thrilled!"}
{"text":"Good quality, good environment, good service, good pricing. Finally a better Japanese restaurant located uptown."}
{"text":"There a few pluses to the restaurant: it was clean, spacious, and had classical music playing in the background.  Even the two-seater tables had a wider bench seat with plenty of room, which was a pleasant surprise.

I ordered the chirashi, but was a little disappointed at the amount of fish given (a total of about 6-7 pieces), although the salmon and tuna ones were a decent size.  The mackerel was pretty good too, and the presentation was nice.  The rice wasn't that great though; it was too soft, and just tasted like something was missing.

Since I ordered off the lunch menu, it also included a salad, miso soup, and a mochi ball for dessert.  The salad was good, although it wasn't anything special (romaine lettuce, some cucumber and some grape tomatoes), the miso soup was fine, and the mochi ball was ok too.  They also give you tea, but it was a bit on the cold side.

The one thing that stood out most was their service.  They started out well, there was a male waiter that came by and took our order and everything was fine.  Near the end of our meal though, as it was nearing their closing time (it was about 2:10 in the afternoon and they closed at 2:30), one of the waitresses came by and started clearing our table, even though we clearly weren't done yet.  She didn't look like she wanted to be there, and we felt very rushed, even though we knew we would've been finished in another 5-10 minutes.  When we left, they didn't even acknowledge that we were going, despite all the staff wishing another table a good day only 15 minutes earlier when they left.

Overall, the food was ok, and the prices are a little on the more expensive side for what you get, but the service has room for improvement.  Due to the large number of sushi restaurants in the area, I would recommend going elsewhere if you want a better experience."}
{"text":"Great spot for authentic sushi.  Love their attention to details and clean, spotless restaurant.  Favorite lunch spot on weekends."}
{"text":"ambience, quite nice, modern.
service, prompt, brief.
food, great.

Had a friend over for the weekend from out of town, was craving sushi on a Sunday night. Called a couple restaurants and could not make a reservation or they were closing by the time I could get a seat. Finally found Inatei, and figured we could give it a try. Upon walking in, eyed a couple of big sashimi platters looking really fresh. Turns out they're on the higher end price wise. we order some pretty standard stuff, but I would say they have some uniqueness to all their dishes. I'm a dessert sort of person, so finished the meal with their tofu cheesecake, and was blown away, which upped their rating for me personally. nothing better than finishing the meal on a good note."}
{"text":"It's probably the only restaurant you should go in Richmond Hill if you want fresh and quality fish. The menu isn't exciting , but you know you aren't getting low grade fish that can give you food poisoning."}
{"text":"Very nice Japanese restaurant in the neighbour but slightly expensive. Great menu selection. High quality of food with great customer service."}
{"text":"This is probably the best japanese restaurant in the area, although you do have to pay the premium price for the quality. 

FOOD: I generally come here for dinner and I get rolls nearly every time since I love them.

I really do their their dragon roll, and the spider roll as well. The sashimi here is always very fresh.

The service is great here, the servers are very friendly. There is always someone on standby to service you."}
{"text":"Good service, very good hot items, unique raw fish specials. Not cheap but quality definitely there."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out since they opened. I have always been curious. 

First impression of this place is, cozy and not for big parties past 6 people. It will be too crowded and you won't enjoy yourselves.

The Sashimi was fresh and the combo platters came with a surprising variety. Shrimp and scallop.

I didn't try any specialty maki rolls. I went with my favorite ones haha
A. Spider roll
B. Spicy salmon roll

Both were good

Things that you should try
A. Deep fried shrimp heads (if you get them with your sashimi platter)
B. Black sesame ice cream

Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant several time as well as host a party here for my staff. It is truly a hidden gem in the 905 area. Its by far the best Japanese restaurant around probably even in Ontario! The quality of the food cannot compare to the AYCE places and the fish are fresh, service impeccable and the restaurant modern. Portions are not large but its quality not quantity here but you do go home full. 
At the moment its the only Japanese Restaurant I will dine in.."}
{"text":"We came here for a late Saturday evening dinner and ordered the sashimi dinner, two handrolls, and beef tataki. The service was prompt. The quality of food was good, but quite expensive."}
{"text":"Called to make reservation a day ahead, come to the restaurant they said \"No booking made!\" No apologize been made!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  
I really wanted to like this place but it wasn't the 4 or 5 star place I was expecting.  

Haven't had sushi in a while and was craving it so a friend suggested Inatei since it was one of the few places that was not AYCE uptown.  Now, in hindsight, we should have stuck with some of the basic items but we couldn't resist ordering from the special fish menu.

I had never had lobster sashimi so we ordered that and then a platter of 3 special fish.  Was disappointed with the presentation of the lobster sashimi especially for the price charged, but the texture was good, with a hint of sweetness.  Ordering lobster sashimi also means you get a 2nd dish with the claws and head cooked, we opted for the soup which was nice.  Lightly favoured by the lobster, had tofu, napa, 2 different mushrooms (YUM!) and some vermicelli.  

The platter of 3 special fish, not worth the price as the pieces were cut very thinly.  Three slices was comparable to 1 slice of regular sashimi.  Taste was ok but again, expecting better quality for the price.

To finish our meal, we had the spicy salmon roll and an unagi roll, both were well made.  Wouldn't say there was more salmon or unagi than other places but they were enjoyable.

Overall, I'm glad my friend suggested Inatei since I got to try lobster sashimi as it's not found in a lot of Japanese restaurants here.  But my experience was as mentioned 3.5 stars at best - the 0.5 was added because service was good.  Would give it another try and order off the regular menu, but maybe when my wallet gets a little heavier!"}
{"text":"When it comes to particularly Japanese cuisine I personally find it not quite easy to rate because depends if you are rating it based on the grade of the sashimi they serve or specifically their hot dishes or  appetizers. I'm referring to Japanese restaurant like Shinobu,  Aoyama,  etc. These consider one of the better ones in uptown,  of course there are many better quality and more authentic Japanese cuisine in downtown Toronto. One could be serving very good grade of sashimi but their hot dishes (even tempura) are totally a failure. One could be charging you same or similar  price as the other one but you are being served a way lower grade sashimi.  
I should actually be writing about Inatei. I have been to Inatei when they first opened and find their food  overrated and overpriced. I  recently I decide to give it another try during lunch in between meetings during weekdays. I ordered a chirashi donburi lunch which comes with soup and salad and a nice bowl of rice top with: 
2 salmon
1 scallop 
1 squid 
2 red tuna
1 mackerel
1 octopus 
2 eggs 
2 Crab meats
1 soft red clam 
1 (which I don't know the correct name, it got a yellow crunchy thing on bottom )
Few small marinated mushrooms
Few japanese yellow pickles 

For $15.99 I think Inatei offers quite a good choices of sashimi in the chirashi donburi.  All are very fresh in  good quality . I will definitely go back to try other dishes on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"The caveat with internet food rating is the internet represents largely certain segment of the consumer spectrum. It does not represent the top and bottom ends as well. For my taste, Inatei is a Chinese run sushi and sashimi restaurant pretending to offer quality of a Japanese run one, and charging premium prices for it. For sure it is not poor quality, it is just not what the prices could support. I would rather go to Zen, or Miyabi, both in the same proximity. There is also one on the North side of Hwy 7 near Kennedy, which name escapes me now but which ownership i hear is related to Inatei. At least the first two justify their higher prices, and the third one does not try to pretend to be what they are not."}
{"text":"Very good sushi for excellent value. Well staffed  and very attentive staff.

Be adventurous and give it a try. I was quite impressed with the atmosphere and noise level."}
{"text":"The quality of the sashimi and sushi is superb, I usually get the sashimi combo for two (which is about 50 dollars, comes with 4 Botan shrimps, scallops, yellow tail and other good stuff) and a few other things. So far I have nothing to complain, service is pretty awesome, food is fresh, I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is one of the best Japanese restaurants uptown.  Tonight we had the Chirashi Suhsi and the dinner bento box.  Price is towards the higher end but it's worth the price.  
Usually people talk about sashimi when they talk about Japanese restaurants.  Their sashimi is good and fresh. But to my surprise, their sirloin beef is actually quite good too!  So as the grilled black cod.  I have tried other items in the menu earlier, and they are all decent.  Free dessert at the end makes it even better =)
I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing, I have been there many times and I am never disappointed.

The service is great, and there is one specific waitress that makes great suggestions. However, there is one waitress that has told me to quickly eat the sushi- because the seaweed will become soggy. The way she had phrased it made it seem like she wanted me to hurry up and finish!

The chicken dumplings are so tasty! The chicken wing is stuffed with vegetables and chicken, instead of rice like at other restaurants. 
Their tofu cheesecake is light and not too sweet. I have never eaten anything at Inatei I have not enjoyed.

I highly recommend this restaurant to seafood and sushi lovers."}
{"text":"This is a high quality Japanese restaurant.  You can find a lot of fish that is not commonly offered.  The restaurant deco is decent.  The service is good and the slice of the sashimi are thick and delicious.  

You can either order from the menu or you can delicate your meal to the staff who can arrange a chef table recommendation for you.  From the chef recommendation will have different sashimi, I mean sometimes the whole fish presented sliced into sashimi.  At the end, the fish bone will be used to boil a tasty soup.   Not to miss the desserts that are one of a kind - ice cream, crème burlee, pudding.

If you are a sake drinker, here they have lots of choices.  I tried a Pears sake which is smooth, chilled and really good while and after your sashimi consumption.

The blue fin tuna has 3 different choices from different part of the fish - they are so good and each has a different texture and your taste buds started to turn.  If you stick with blue fin, you will not like Hamachi and salmon any more.

The grilled mackerel is grilled in front of you with a burner, very entertaining.

The black cod is so flaky added a boost in flavor.

All oyster, sushi and sashimi are so fresh.  The uni is large the length of your palm and superb fresh.

The Sirloin Steak is really well cooked to medium rare

This is a must try Japanese restaurant if you enjoy your sashimi"}
{"text":"Inatei is located in a plaza of restaurants a block north of the Leslie and Hwy 7 intersection.  

I ordered the Dinner Bento Box B which offers the best value in my honest opinion. 

Comes with Sirloin Beef, Grilled Black Cod, Assortment Tempura (Vegetable & Shrimp), 3 pcs California Roll, 2 pcs of Red Tuna & 3 pcs Salmon Sashimi 
$29.99

Preparation -  5/5
-perfect thickness of cuts and creative arrangements, dark wooden chopsticks, to ceramic dishes teapots

Ambiance - 4/5
-jazz music playing in the background, dim lighting, dark furniture, clean, and quiet for a weekday dinner time 5:30pm

Food - 4/5

What I liked..
-Red tuna which was especially fresh! 
-Sirloin Steak cooked to my liking a medium and flavored well
-The black cod was melt in your mouth which flakes so delicately
-Salad was good, house-made miso sake dressing
-Dessert - blueberry with fresh cream served in a shot glass

Not so much..
-Miso soup was average, tasted fishy
-Tea was luke warm, could be served hotter 

Service - 5/5
two servers in your peripheral vision at all time. available at a moments call. 

Price - 3.5/5
$29.99 is pricey for a bento box, it is a high quality one packed with a great variety . portions are small more of a sampler.

Overall: 4 stars

Taking this all in account its a 4 star. The food and service is better than average.  If you desire a finer Japanese dining experience consider Inatei as an option."}
{"text":"Very pricey but strongly recommened to try once in your lifetime !

Nice server, in a not big but great, quiet atmosphere in a medium Chinese plaza."}
{"text":"A standout in this neighbourhood of cheap Asian places. This place feels like fine dining, at a very reasonable price. Fresh ingredients, well presented, very friendly and efficient staff. It's great to have proper implements and china mugs rather than plastic. The attention to detail is remarkable. 
I went for a beef udon, which included a very fresh tuna sushi roll, small salad, miso soup, and a charming and tantalizing earl grey tea custard in a shot glass."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and the place was very busy, seems that most of the patrons were also on business lunches. The host was very friendly and told us the wait would be about 5 min and promptly seated us within that time. 

They have a lunch combo menu, so we we opted to both get the 6-piece sashimi meal that comes with 2 hand rolls per person. We requested the sashimi to be all salmon, which confused the waitress and she informed us after checking with her manager that it would cost an extra $2/person because of our request. I found that odd since all the sushi places I've been to will accommodate that without any extra charge. Plus, wouldn't they be saving money by giving us the same type of fish?

We accepted the extra charge and inquired if we can change our hand rolls to spicy salmon hand rolls - this of course is also hassle and charge-free at sushi places I've been to, but not this one. We were told that it would cost an extra $1/roll so total of $4 since we have 2 rolls each with our convos. So in total...we have to pay an extra $8 for our combo because we wanted specifically salmon. 

Our lunch orders:

1) 2 lunch combo 'C's - each set contained 6 pieces salmon sashimi, 2 hand rolls, miso soup and salad

2) Fried soft shell crabs

3) Beef gyoza

Our miso soup and salad-  pretty standard.  Our hand roll orders were very tasty - spicy salmon was fresh, with large chunks of salmon inside and they stuffed the hand roll generously.

When our salmon sashimi platters came, they forgot our request of having only salmon so they had to take it back to the kitchen.  About another 10 min later, our salmon arrived. The pieces were cut on the more generous side in terms of thickness but also with a few thinner ones. The salmon itself was fresh but not the best I've had - nothing to be wowed about. 

The fried soft shell crabs came and tasted pretty good, again not completely blown away as it was mostly the batter. But tasty enough to satisfy the craving for some fried goodness.

Beef gyoza was tasty, but I haven't been to a place that messes up gyoza!

Overall our meal came to around $70 after tax + tip, so for a lunch, that is on the pricier side. Plus if you are someone who is accustomed to altering your order a bit from the standard menu offering, you will be charged extra."}
{"text":"Went to Toronto for my semi-annual foodie road trip.  A friend/restaurateur told me about this gem of a place.  
The fish is more fresh than any other sushi restaurant I've had anywhere in North America, far better than in New York or New Jersey.
Service is excellent.  Sushi and sashimi slices are generous.
I enjoyed the food so much that I had to come back a second time within my 4-day weekend before returning home.
My only regret is that its 500 miles away, and likely another 6 months until I'm able to return."}

Extra information:

* Lunch special
* Open for lunch and dinner
* Parking at the Plaza

It's a given fact that all amazing Chinese restaurants are up in Richmond Hill/Markham area, but how about Japanese food? I think it really depends on what type of Japanese food you are looking for. I still have couple authentic Japanese restaurants in downtown of Toronto that I need to visit (one of the reasons it's taking me awhile to visit them all is because they are mostly on the pricey side), but heard many good things about this place so I decided to check it out.

It was a hot day, so walking in- it was nice to see a brightly lit restaurant that was well air-conditioned with high ceiling with colorful decoration everywhere. They even have a oyster bar on one side and a beautifully decorated wall with sake bottles.


Ordered: Spicy Salmon Maki 5/5

* Spicy salmon chopped up mixed with green onions $3.99 each 
* This is a very simple dish with only few flavors that depends heavily on freshness of the fish
* If the fish is not very fresh, restaurants tend to over-do the sauce
* There was plenty of chopped up fresh salmon pieces inside
* Chopped onions and little fish eggs were added to the mix
* There was just enough rice and the fish to rice portion was perfect
* My mom actually ordered another one after finishing hers
* For the price you pay, it's very much worth it

Ordered: Negi Toro Roll 4/5

* Minced green onion with tuna belly for $8.99
* Noone in my family like toro for some reason but I love it
* They find it the fish a little too heavy and rich (personal preference)
* For some reason this came with the rice a little too warm
* Otherwise, toro was very smooth
* Toro is a expensive fish, but $8.99 for these little rolls a little stiff


Ordered: Sashimi Moriawase 4/5

* 15 pieces of assorted sashimi for $27.99
* I loved the long dish and the way they presented the sashimi platter
* It came with 9 different types of sashimi
* Salmon, tuna, squid, scallop, sweet shrimp, mackerel, tako and more
* All the sashimi pieces were super fresh 
* They asked us if we wanted the shrimp heads deep fried, yes please!
* I didn't really like the little squid rolls (found it too slimy/sticky)
* For a fresh sashimi plate at $27.99, it's a good portion to get a taste of everything

Ordered: Spider Roll 5/5

* roll with deep fried soft shell crab for $7.50
* Surprisingly spider roll was cheap compared to other rolls
* These were huge with lots of soft shell crab inside
* Soft shell crab pieces were crispy and fresh
* Accompanied with creamy avocado pieces and spicy mayo on top as well as teriyaki sauce
* This was probably one of the best spider rolls I've ever had

Ordered: Zaru Soba 1/5

* Cold noodles for $7.99
* Basically you dip the noodles into the cold broth (almost like light soy sauce) and eat it
* This was the only disappointing dish out of the meal
* Noodle was way over cooked and it was too mushy 
* We actually left half of this because it was so bad

Ordered: Gindara Saikyu Yaki 4/5

* Grilled black cod in miso paste for $9.99
* This is normally done quite well at most place 
* The fish was fatty and very moist
* Good balance between fish and the miso paste, it did not overpower the fish
* This is good to have with a bit of rice

Complimentary Dessert: Lychee Pudding

At Inatei, they always give you complimentary dessert at the end and they are all made in house!We were given lychee pudding and it was delicious (might have been more so because it was free)-apparently the desserts constantly change, more reasons to visit often?

Summary: Inatei is a authentic Japanese restaurant and you want to stick to what they do well.They serve fresh sashimi and rolls at a reasonable price so do explore even with the regular menu.Service is excellent and the restaurant is exceptionally clean. Do visit when you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good.  But coordination is not.  All of our main course (hot) dishes came before sushi.  It is not the first time, too. :("}
{"text":"I stopped at this restaurant for dinner when I was looking at Seneca college in TO for a weekend with my Mom, who'd never really had Japanese food, and well, it converted her and impressed me! The restaurant, to start off, is BEAUTIFUL. Even the place settings. No cheap paper placemats and disposable chopsticks- proper Japanese dishes and cutlery. Also an interesting design to space out tables and booths, themed like traditional fusuma and shouji screens and with BEAUTIFUL noren curtains. And a live lobster tank by the sushi bar.

 I ordered the lobster tempura dinner and Mom the teriyaki salmon- it came with miso soup, complementary tea (the whole pot, too), a bowl of white rice, and the main dishes themselves (mine was a lobster tail done in tempura, a variety of tempura vegetables including my favourite yam, and a salad of sorts, Mom's was a large salmon steak done in teriyaki seasoning and a large bunch of mixed vegetables, I think- I was too busy enjoying mine to look much!). Portions were good sized and both of us were too full to eat everything as a result, but we sure tried. A small complimentary dessert of lychee pudding too, that was a plus (didn't really like it, personally, but I just didn't like the flavour of it. There was nothing actually wrong with it). The lobster came fresh out of the tank when I ordered it, so was it ever delicious! And they served the meat fancily tucked under the boiled tail and on a bed of this deep-fried broom shaped garnish of sorts (I tried eating it. It's technically edible, just not tasty. Leave it as garnish).

Haven't tried the sushi menu yet, but I'm going back when I move to TO in September and I'll check it out then!

The service was fantastic, though the waitress was a bit on the \"watch-you-like-a-hawk\" side, especially with us right by the kitchens. I'm guessing because at the time we were the only ones in the restaurant (we had an early dinner and it was thursday night). I certainly liked the prompt service, though I tend to like a little more privacy than that to converse while eating.
It's a bit pricey (expect to pay $30-40 a person for a dinner out depending on what you order), but VERY worth it."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the beautiful interior and cute design of the cups and plates. The vibe was wonderful and very homey. It didn't feel cramped at all and the service was great. The waitress offered to take a picture for us when she saw us taking pictures. She also explained the menu and was especially understanding. I ordered the California roll, Dragon roll, and Katsudon (which came with a salad and miso soup). Both of the rolls tasted fresh and were presented really nicely. The Katsudon was made hot and was delicious. At the end of the meal, we were served a complimentary cup of lychee pudding which I enjoyed a lot. The lychee flavor was strong and the pudding was smooth. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Inatei. I would definitely visit this restaurant the next time I come to Canada."}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for sushi/Japanese food. Certainly if the clientele are any indication. it's was heavily populated by Asian community.

the  food here seems  pretty authentic. Appetizers were good if not outstanding. the sushi was extraordinarily well done and reasonably priced. I thought the panfried udon noodles were well executed. 

Bar selection is limited to sake and beer -- be advised"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner with a small group and everyone was impressed by the food. I was surprised this place has been around for 10 years as I've been looking for good quality uptown sushi and never heard of this place.

The restaurant itself is medium sized with 4 people booths on a side and some smaller and bigger tables. 

The menu is really long and offers a lot of different options (sushi, grilled food, donburi etc) including daily specials. I wanted to try the omakase sushi which comes with 10 pieces. The pieces were actually quite big and everything tasted good. Side note that it didn't come with salmon, I didn't mind that and ordered salmon on a side. My friends ordered different types of donburi which they really liked and we shared a beef enoki roll appetizer. We tried uni as well, which was really fresh.

The prices are a little higher than average but not much different from any other places in downtown that serve higher grade fish. I thought our bill was reasonable with the amount of food and drink we ordered.

I thought the service was good as well. We were waiting for everyone to arrive so we took some time to order food and we never felt rushed. The waitress was also really friendly and answered our questions about sake."}
{"text":"Was here for dinner. It was easy to find parking as they have a private lot available. Restaurant seems quiet when I walked in but to my surprise, it gotten pretty busy for a week night. Ambience is modern and chic.  

Ordered the standard sushi from the menu. It came with 8 pieces of sushi and 6 pieces maki roll. Everything was fresh but I thought there were too much rice for their sushi (personal preference). I loved the maki roll; not exactly sure what was in it but it tasted like toro. It was excellent in flavour and texture all together. Meal came with a complimentary dessert which was some kinda pudding topped with red bean. 

Service was good. Staffs were all really attentive and polite. Came a few times around to ask if we needed anything. 

Overall, it was a decent experience; I will still come back from time to time. It can get expensive depending on what you order. For what it is (quantity and quality), I don't think their pricing make sense as there are many other places that has the same quality of food at a lower cost."}
{"text":"Inatei is a nice restaurant, but its a la carte price for the variety/quantity cannot compare to higher end ayce jap restaurants.

Service was good but I think they need to improve on the variety/taste to attract customers if price and $ is to stay the same."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a beautiful restaurant tucked away in a plaza in Richmond Hill. Their dishes are very generic but the fish is very fresh. Overall food quality is there but nothing over the top amazing."}
{"text":"I came here for a business lunch and it was my first time here.  I have to say the tuna and salmon was really fresh.  The tantaksu (I probably spelt it incorrectly) was crispy and just the right portion size.  The dipping sauce for the tantaksu did not just taste like bbq sauce...it was tasty.  The salmon rice balls (that's what I called them) were interesting and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  My bento box came with salad, miso soup and a desert at the end.  I picked the mango pudding instead of the ice cream.  Overall It was a really good experience.  The service was very friendly.  The place is very clean.  I would come back again!"}
{"text":"The decor of this restaurant modernizes the traditional Japanese esthetic of tatami mats and private rooms. Bolts of metal or wood ( hard to distinguish) glazed with a metallic sheen create a makeshift wall and  separate the main dining area of the restaurant from the group dining area. We ordered a sushi platter , sashimi platter, steamed egg, seafood miso soup, grilled saba and yakisoba.The sushi was delicious and the sashimi tasted fresh.  The soup also was a surprise and was more sweet than regular miso soup and had seafood inside. The noodles had a sweet teriyaki taste to it and were also enjoyable. Overall it was an good experience and would be a good restaurant to take good friends / guest."}

Food is exceptionally bad. Frozen beef sashimi hard like rock! Have to wait 20 min in order to soften a little. The beef texture is like bubble gum. Talked to the owner and he said beef sashimi is like that.....and ignores everything. Really!! Unbelievable!! The beef rice with no taste at all. Sake was over heated in a microwave that burn your lips. Whoever read this!!Don't go to this inexperience, poor service, Chinese operate Japanese Food.

Reply from Inatei restaurant 

Maria, thanks for your comment. I respect the facts that you are entitled to your opinion. We treasure  our clients' feedback and take it very seriously but at the same time we cannot tolerate any false clams and lies against our restaurant. We have been operating for eight years and most of our customers are regular and repeated customers. The fact is that you may have a high expectation  on the quality of our foods but the only time I had a conversation with you was when you and your family came to the restaurant and asked for a table for 6 persons. It was Monday night and we were having a full house( we would not be  having a full house on a Monday night if we were as bad as you have described).And I told you that there would be a wait for 25-30 minutes for a table for 6.  I asked for your cell phone  number and we would call you when we have a table for you. You later on came back and told me that you would not mind to split your family into 2 smaller tables if available. So we were able to offered two tables to you later on  , so you and your husband sitting in 2 persons booth  and your parent/in-laws & your 2 daughters sitting in a bigger booth. After that we did not have any conversation for the rest of the night. Restaurant business is a tough business. It is not easy to survive in an area that has the highest concentration of restaurant in Onatario. We treasure any honest opinion and would make changes that could improve our service and products provided to our customers. To mobilize family Facebook Accounts to discredit us with false clams and  racist comment such as ' Chinese operate Japanese Foood' is cyber bully.  I came to Canada in 1976 and became an Canadian citizen a few years later. I am originally from Hong Kong and am very proud of my heritage As a parent, you should set a good example to your 2 little lovely daughters and teach them we are all Canadian.

My reply

Can you explain what you mean by you always treasure your customers' comments/opinions? From your response above, all I could get is you are accusing your customers being a liar and a racist when they were complaining about the quality of the food. 

If you are offended by my comments about \"Chinese run Japanese\" restaurant, I apologize for that. However, I still stand strongly about my other comments about the food quality and service. The fact that you brought up the incident about splitting table while I had never mentioned in my comments, it proves that you don't even realize what your customers were complaining about and never communicated with your staff. We complained about the beef sashimi to one of your waitress staff. Therefore, before you started to cyber bullying about my parenting which I strongly do not think is your business, perhaps you should find out what exactly had happened.

 Extremely disappointed with Inatei Japanese Cuisine"}
{"text":"Restaurant has really fresh and high quality food. 

Dinner was quite pricey if you wanted to get full with just their sushi bar food but fish was full of flavour and was presented in a great way.  Their was a great variety of food. 

Waiters were really friendly but the atmosphere was a bit too loud for a Japanese restaurant. It was really easy to find a seat and parking is not a problem.

I would definitely go back and try their dinner again but would also want to go and try their lunch and see if the lunch is less pricey."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend one night to celebrate a special occasion and so we weren't skimpy on our order. Between the two of us, we spent about $250. We ordered their special fish of the day and I thought it was very meh. I know good fish and this was not it. 
I'll be honest though. Their uni was pretty good value and tasted pretty fresh. I also liked their spicy salmon roll. 

The waitresses take the time to explain what each fish is. They should though. Considering how much money I was spending. 
Anyway I won't return. Way better sushi out there. This place doesn't amuse me. Sorry."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch on a Wednesday around 12:30.  It was full, but not crowded, and I got a table immediately.  The decor is nice and the restaurant itself is very clean.

I ordered the Set A lunch which was 6 PC California Roll and 6 PC sushi (I requested Salmon and Tuna and they were happy to accommodate for a small $3 fee).

The salad dressing was sweet and delicious.  The soup was quite standard.  The sushi portions were generous and the salmon was perfect!  The California Rolls were thick and made of quality ingredients.

My waitress was friendly, attentive, and took great care of her tables.  

I love sushi, but am definitely no expert...this place made me comfortable, the food was delicious, and I left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with my friend.  We ordered to a bill totaling over $100 but sadly was definitely not worth it. I am not sure why this restaurant has a 4 star rating, I honestly believe it is made-up reviews. Let me provide and drop the truth for you.

$25 sushi dinner: (came with miso soup):
The sushi was mediocre, saddest part is that the rice they used for all their sushi/donburi dishes is not japanese rice... but lukewarm Chinese rice!  Are you serious..? The rice was not even cooled down, appeared blazing hot from the rice cooker I have at home. My sushi was falling apart just from the lift from my chopsticks.  Disappointing they were serving this at a sushi restaurant.

$25 sashimi dinner: (came with miso soup):
This dinner came with the pre-mentioned sad lukewarm Chinese rice (once again not japanese rice) The sashimi was average. Not writing home about this... so disappointed at this dish.

$10 soft shell crab and $8 deep friend tempura egg plant:
We ordered the appetizers first, but the chefs/waitress forgot about this dish, and only asked us if everything came after we finished our main course (the 2 dinners above).  Instead of apologizing and giving us the appetizers for free, as it was hugely their mistake especially serving us it after the main course.  Instead, I asked her to cancel the order (its obvious they forgot the appetizer, doesn't take 45mins to prepare), she told us that she will check. Came back and said, \"oh sorry, we can't cancel now, the dish is almost ready) I Lol'ed after, since the dish came 30mins after.  They really wanted us to pay for the over priced appetizers.

$10 ramen:
We also got the Ramen, a mistake.... It really tasted like instant noodles I make at home.. no joke.

$18 BBQ Eel donburi:
Another mistake to order.  The dish came in a small plastic container box (really...?) we opened it to find that the BBQ eel only filled half of the box on top of the rice (what is with this picky size quantity?).  Once again, it came with the disgusting lukewarm Chinese rice, not Japanese rice at all.  Another disappointment.

Also, there were multiple times where the server was bringing us the bill and the debit card machine. Like really...? The time it took for them to prepare and cook the food took so long (especially the appetizers) that the servers thought we were done eating.  It seemed like they really wanted us gone and needed the table.  Like come on, gtfo and let us eat in peace.

To wrap up, I really am confused at the high rating others provided.  When we went, it was truly disappointing, to the borderline of disgusting and sad. Total was over $100, of course no tips given (trying to kick us out with the bill like that, plus the aforementioned disappointments and forgetting our appetizers but still making us pay for it).  They already got more than enough for tips through their over-priced cheap dishes.

Not coming back to here... you should avoid this place as well unless you want to spend a few hours of your pay down the drain."}
{"text":"Too little food for the price man, quality was alright but too expensive IMO."}
{"text":"Came here with my usual designated sushi friend. We both ordered the omakase sushi that was 33 dollars for 10 pieces. The set included suzuki, houbou, aji, ika, mirugai, amaebi, hotategai, one that looked like real shredded crab, uni, and an ago. The names of the fish were given by the waitress, which was a plus. The waitress also offered to fry the sweet shrimp head, which was also a plus.

Ok I was slightly disappointed that the omakase sushi didn't include otoro. However, we did order two pieces on the side (at $20 per 2 pieces) because if a place has toro on the menu, we just have to test it out.

In terms of quality, it was good, but not that spectacular. The mirugai and the amaebi were good, but the uni and the hotategai were not as fresh as they could be. The highlight tho, was the otoro sushi. The texture and softness were excellent, and it was of a generous size (ie not being stingy). Quality of otoro was comparable to that of Yasu and Jabistro (tho the rice was probably better at Yasu and Jabistro). For comparison's sake, yasu otoro and jabistro otoro were $10 and $13 per piece, respectively, at my last visit.

We were unfortunately still hungry, so I ordered a tonkatsu udon ($11), and my friend ordered tamago sushi and a tempura. The tempura shrimp was huge! And it was not overloaded with batter (like when I was at kiku, an ayce resto). My udon was good but I remember the soup flavor and udon quality was better when I was at Aoyama and possibly Le cafe Michi (the latter I need to test again). The tonkatsu was excellent. At $11 dollars tho, kinda pricey for a tonkatsu udon I think.

Our meal didn't include a soup, which was a downside. I guess the omakase sushi wasn't technically a dinner meal? They did offer a coffee pudding dessert at the end, which was really tasty.

Having looked at the menu, it seems like this restaurant offers some better selection than some typical Japanese restaurants. Their special menu included torched toro, oyster soup (which I so wanted to try but didn't), and other items one wouldn't typically see too much of. Most of it is on the pricey side tho. They also serve ankimo (monk fish liver), which was a plus (tho I didn't try).

To conclude, the omakase sushi quality was good in general, but not as fresh as it could be. Excellent service, but most things seemed to be on pricier side.

8.5/10 for the quality (8 for everything else, +.5 for the awesome otoro)
8.5/10 for service
8/10 for value
8.5/10 overall (not an average)"}
{"text":"Ordered the chirashi and it was delicious. Service was a little slow but fish was fresh and no other complaints. Lunch menu was ample, but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch and dinner a couple times, and I gotta say, its definitely a Japanese restaurant worth looking into. With really fresh sashimi for a decent price, and great hot food, you can't go wrong coming here!

Came by today for lunch, and they have quite a nice lunch menu. Prices seem to have gone up recently, but still reasonable. I got one the Bento Boxes and my mom and aunt got different noodles with sushi. 

A bit more than I would want to pay for a bento box ($15.99), but a great meal overall. The Tonkatsu was absolutely perfect, fried just right with a great texture contrast on the outside and inside. The Salmon Onigiri is on of the specialties, and definitely worth trying as it not something you get to try a lot in this area. A bit dry for my personal taste, but can always add the tonkatsu sauce! 

The noodles are awesome as well, as you get a whole maki or hand roll, as well as your udon/soba/ramen. Definitely a great deal with each between $9.99-12-99. 

Make sure you check Inatei out if you are a Japanese cuisine fan! Great for both lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch a few times and it is pretty great. I have had Sake Don and Chirashi. Both have been absolutely delicious with super fresh fish. 

A bonus is that they also give dessert and have miso and salad to start. The desserts are often of super quality that is to die for. I really enjoy coming here!"}
{"text":"Inatei is one of the few Japanese restaurants that I enjoy going.They focus on quality rather than fast and cheap set meals. Separating themselves from the many All-You-Can-Eat Japanese restaurants around the area, Inatei offers an assortment of appetizers, sunomono (vinegared dishes), sashimis, sushi rolls and robata-yakis (Off the grill).  For those who prefer a more fulfilling hot dishes, Inatei also has a variety of set dinners and bento boxes. They also offer bento box for vegetarians. 

I tried the Ume bento box and it came with unagi, chicken teriyaki and a choice of hand roll or sushi roll. Both unagi and chicken were very well marinated and just the right portion. Their sushis had a nice balance of rice and condiments, They sushi stays intact even when you pick them up with your chopsticks.  

Generally, I think Inatei is fairly priced, considering the quality that you get, approximately $10-15 for lunch or $20-30 for dinner per person. Staffs were polite and well trained. They know what to recommend you and always at a reachable distance to make sure your needs are taken care of. Overall, I enjoy dining at Inatei. Nice decor with high ceilings and very spacious seating. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"This review is long, looong overdue and reposted with slight variation from fb because I'm lazy and still mean every word. Me and my family have been going to inatei for special events such as birthdays and anniversaries or when we're just craving quality sashimi for years, and have never ever been disappointed. The ambiance, plating and overall presentation of the food really adds another layer to the experience. Raymond; the owner and his staff (shoutout to Monica aka best waitress) and his wife (who I've never seen but she makes all the desserts and omg they're so amazing you'll weep) have always provided such grade A* service that unlike a lot of the restaurants downtown always keeps me coming back for more.  

Everyday a new fresh sashimi Menu is made (Thursday-Sat has the best options) and that's what we usually like to order from. Over the years I've been able to eat the most exotic Japanese dishes, most notable include: Uni, Ebi, lobster sashimi, Shima aji, kinki fish, seared tuna belly etc.The prices can seem quite high but when comparing the quality to some popular Japanese restaurants downtown like Guu Izakaya, I find the prices very reasonable. 

Like many fresh foods, prices and available items can vary throughout the year but I find there is always something I enjoy. Entire fishes are made to order and you can choose to make the the remains of (after the fish mean has been sliced and presented) into another course of fish soup or have the remains grilled or fried. I like how nothing's wasted. On the main menu I really like to order the spicy salmon maki with extra crunch (it has green onion so be sure to let the waitress know if that's not your thing) and the sake roll which is basically a big ass palm sized cucumber roll with salmon, carrots, cucumber avocado and fake crab. Another nice touch is that they serve white ginger (sweeter and crisper then the typical pink one) and fresh ground wasabi which my dad really enjoys.

They offer complimentary dessert at the end which is always a great touch. The dessert varies, from shot glass puddings (coffee, berry, durian, lychee) to uncle tetsu-esque cheesecakes or the thousand layer crepe cake. I've genuinely never had a bad dessert. The owners wife makes the majority of the desserts and me and my sister are her biggest fans. Personally I have been unable to find a restaurant that beats Inatei, it's my absolute favourite restaurant and really deserves more recognition IMO. Overall inatei is definitely a restaurant with range; it can be both casual or fancy and I really like that despite their highbrow ingredients they treat you like family, there's no pretension and I've always had the best time. 

TL:DR Get the sashimi, rolls and stay for the complimentary dessert, tres amazing."}
{"text":"Third time visiting this place. Food was excellent, service and pricing also great. Really van recommend this place to friends and others. Please keep the food quality, pricing and service like this."}
{"text":"I had given up on quality Japanese cuisine uptown.  All that I knew of Japanese (sushi specifically) outside of Toronto were subpar or AYCE, and I can't stand the stuff!  Inatei, you've completely changed my mind about sushi uptown!

Inatei is beautifully decorated, surprisingly empty for a weekday dinner, and just off of the crazy main highway 7 restaurant corridor.  The food presentation is very pretty and you can actually see the fresh quality of the sashimi.  We had the sashimi complete dinner and the vegetarian bento ($18).  Both sets came with miso soup (a bit salty but still tasty), salad and a creamy coffee custard served in a shooter glass for dessert.  The portions are surprisingly generous - I couldn't finish my tofu steaks and had to pack them away for lunch.  I would say that the vegetarian bento was surprisingly inventive and definitely very tasty!  The side order of spicy tuna rolls were appropriately refreshing.

Good service, romantic atmosphere.  A definite recommend!  Thanks, Yelp, for helping me find this place!"}
{"text":"Very. Fresh. Sashmi. I can still recall the lemony-ness that was on my sashimi appetizer. It provided a very clean bite to it."}
{"text":"Inatei is my go to place for quality sashimi/sushi when I'm too lazy to make the trek downtown. I've been here a couple of times, and have always gotten some sort of sashimi and sushi platter. The quality each time has been consistently pretty good. This unfortunately means that the price is also up there. However, I think the price is reasonable given the quality, and is comparable to the better sushi restaurants downtown. Apart from the sashimi/sushi, one of my favourite dishes that I always order when I'm here is the Uni, Maguro & Ikura Kaisendon, which is uni, tuna and fish roe on rice. I find that they usually put a pretty good portion of the sashimi on the rice, and mixed together with the rice, it's super yummy.

The restaurant is very spacious and clean. The service is very attentive. They always introduce the sashimi/sushi when it's brought to the table. If you get a sashimi platter that has sweet shrimp, they will also offer to fry the shrimp head for you. There's also complimentary dessert and oranges at the end of the meal. I've had different desserts each time I've been there, but it's always been pretty good."}
{"text":"My go to sushi place in Richmond Hill! Their food is so fresh and if you go at lunch, they have really well priced lunch meals. The combos also come with these wonderful pudding-like desserts in little double shot glasses that are incredibly yummy. The sashimi is very fresh here and you get a lot of big pieces. It's a big pricier than other restaurants in the area, but I think it's worth it. The restaurant has a great feel once inside - the decor makes it feel very peaceful."}
{"text":"Overall 4.5 stars for the combination of service, food and restaurant atmosphere. 

It was my first time here, so I ordered the sushi, sashimi moriawase. It fullfilled my wants to try sushi and sashimi. LOVE IT! Like other people said the sashimi was fresh. It came with salmon, hamachi,the  saba, shrimp, scallop, tako, and surf clam. Best red tuna and salmon in Markham area. 

Beef tataki - the beef was really good, a step away from impressive. Perhaps, improvement on the dipping sauce could make the beef taste even better and unique.

Chashu ramen is not bad. I like thr soup and the chashu, not too salty. 

Finally, I love the earl grey flavor yogurt (pudding)."}
{"text":"Went to Inatei yesterday for lunch. There was no line up so I thought lunch would be fast. Didn't turn out that way. It was a long wait. We were late going back to work because it took 45 minutes to get our food. When asked, they said that they were low on staff. 

Ordered two bento boxes. The food quality was good. The sushi was very fresh. Like always, the portions are a little bit smaller for its price. Over all, an ok experience. 

Pro

Fresh fish/food

Con

Long wait for the food
Small portion for price point."}
{"text":"This is my top place for either date night or friends and family gathering restaurant in this area. I come here very often. Food never disappoints and service is always excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations after seeing all the good reviews and was not disappointed. Visited on a Monday night around 6:30 pm, and the restaurant was about half-3/4 full for the entire duration of the stay.  They did ask if we made reservations (no) but spacing did not seem to be an issue. The plaza it is located in has plenty of parking in front and at the side, and the location had a cozy feel to it and comfortable seating. Service was very friendly and were always checking on us to make sure food was good and tea was filled. 

Both me and my friend ordered the Inatei Bento, which pretty much had a bit of everything: soup, salad, cod, steak, tempura, sushi, and sashimi, with dessert as well. The \"main dishes\" were the highlight for me. The sashimi (red tuna and salmon) was definitely fresh and was not chewy at all. Steak was done right for me (medium rare) went well with the rice. The cod was light and did not flake apart. Dessert was a lychee milk pudding. All in all it is a good variety of items that fit well together. 

Value wise perhaps lunch is the better choice (have not been but will go back for that now). We were looking for a place to sit down and chat so this atmosphere fit well."}
{"text":"Inatei is one of the higher end (more expensive, less quantity) Chinese run Japanese restaurants in the area.  You get the impression once you come in that it is not a run of the mill mom and pop restaurant.  The service is pretty good.  

One thing I love to order here is their duck breast ramen (substituted to ramen, $1 surcharge) which was pretty good.  This item seems to be a perpetual special item on the special menu.  I needed to order extra noodles as the portion is pretty small.  Note, their broth has lots of MSG, I was super thirsty afterwards.

Bento boxes are pricier than most restaurants, but the food is prepared well.  Their rolls are good too.  All of their ingredients seem to be of higher quality and that is reflected in the cost.

3.5 stars (minus 1/2 star for the excessive MSG)"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and we were seated at the bar.

We ordered the assorted sushi, sashimi for $65. Ingredients were fresh - great quality. The serving is kind of small but is expected with the quality you receive. There was a small complementary dessert at the end of meal which was nothing too special. My friend and I left content but definitely still can eat afterwards. 

Service was friendly and efficient. This is one of the more expensive Japanese restaurant in Markham I have tried but probably one of the better quality ones. The restaurant itself is not too big, quite intimate."}
{"text":"One of my favourite japanese restaurants in Richmond hill, i particularly enjoy their dragon roll, spicy salmon roll and fried udon. The quality of food is always consistent, and the place is always clean and not too loud (except the occasional groups of people from china). The staff are courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"Inatei serves good Japanese fare at a reasonable price.

ATMOSPHERE: Inatei sits in a strip mall complex amid various other restaurants. It's well decorated and bright on the inside, so it has a fresh look.

SERVICE: The service here is quick and friendly.

FOOD: I was very pleased with their chashu ramen with tonkatsu (pork) broth. It was a large bowl filled with noodles (obviously), corn, egg, mushrooms, and slow roasted pork which pulled apart easily. The sushi and sashimi were also high quality. It was clear the fish was fresh, which is a big plus.

VALUE: I recommend coming here during lunch when there is special pricing. If you do that, the value aspect is very good, especially given the food quality."}
{"text":"This one is a personal favourite! My first time here and the first impression was tremendous. Came here with high expectations because many friends have commented on how their food is uber fresh.. They were definitely right! I really enjoyed my stay tonight - service, environment and food were all exceptional.

We ordered quite a bit of food and I probably had 85% of it lol. We ordered two dinners, one hand roll and sushi. I don't remember what the fiance ordered for sushi, but it was so good. The sushi was the perfect amount of soft/tenderness when I bit into it. It didn't fall apart like T&T sushi, but how can you compare? Sushi came before anything else, so I kind of devoured it before I managed to snap a picture LOL. I did, however, get a picture of the hand roll. I didn't have one because we only got one. According to friends and fiance, this roll is thaa bomb - I will try that next time. The two dinners that came shortly after were the fried oyster and grilled steak. I obviously had the steak because I'm beef boy. The steak was seared to perfection (medium rare) and with a bit of teriyaki sauce all boiled down to a NOM FACE. It was evident that the steak was not of Keg status, but it was good enough. Steak was tender and slightly chewy, but it wasn't medium rare as I asked for. I guess it didn't really bother me because I was just that darn hungry hehe. The fried oyster was equally impressive and delicious, meaning I will not further comment on it lol

Let me backtrack for a second - we walked in thinking it was kind of sketchy because the windows were plastered with a matte white material (got something to hide?). When we were inside, we were immediately greeted by a gentleman that looked like the baus. He made it feel like I was home. It was cozy and very nicely furnished. I kind of hated my seat because the backrest was so straight, oh well.. No points taken off this review, even with the limited parking spaces.. Because the food was just that fresh!

Service was quick, accurate and courteous. Cannot get better than that! Go and check this place out if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Inatei Japanese Cuisine is a gorgeous hidden gem located in Richmond Hill. I loved the zen like atmosphere upon walking in and was kindly greeted with a hot towel (which was perfect on a freezing day). The menu is very extensive, ranging from plenty of raw and cooked apps, to cooked entrees (bento boxes), to sushi entrees and rolls. It's a little pricy, but definitely worth the quality. 

I had the 6 piece sushi and maki roll and was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't all your standard 6 pieces that you usually get. In fact, the only common pieces I can name are the salmon, tuna, and the shrimp. It also came with octopus and squid, which I've never seen in your standard 6 piece set (unless I'm a delusional NYer and this is standard in Toronto). All pieces were fantastic and so fresh. The maki roll was a spicy tuna roll, which was by far the best spicy tuna roll I've had in my life. I've read that spicy tuna rolls are the worst / cheapest thing to get because they're just chopping up the worst parts of tuna and disguising it in sauce. However, the tuna in this roll actually tasted super fresh. The tuna wasn't mushy either, so you can actually taste the texture of the tuna, which I loved. The entire meal was so good that I wish I ordered more!

Also loved how you get a cute tea kettle filled with green tea to sip on throughout your entire meal. On top of that, they bought out a complimentary dessert - soy milk pudding, which was good as well. 

Regardless of if you're in Richmond Hill or not, I would definitely drive out here if you're craving sushi."}
{"text":"We ordered udon, fried squid and eel pancake. They are all taste similar. It is quite bored that chef probably used the same spice. The fried squid is even a little bit bitter. So there is no much to recommend."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-4
Service-3
Food-4
Strikeouts-1/3

We Went here for my dad's birthday for lunch and left with mixed impressions. There's definitely a few hit or misses here.  First turn off which is where I would give my strike is the lack of courtesy. Easily ordered the most expensive dishes on the menu, which included 6 salads and miso soups. We had 7 people, and common business sense dictates that a complementary salad and soup be provided. This was not the case, we were given the excuse that the $69.99 sashimi platter doesn't come with it. I would understand if we only ordered like 6 combos, we ordered 6 plus a really expensive dish. It's literally the cost of $1. That's like tea money.

Now the quality of food was definitely good. Good cuts of sashimi, good rolls with the combos, and definitely decent ramen. From the lunch special, do not order the \"dons\". It is a complete rip off. The size was tiny!!!! It was the smallest don I've ever seen. I swear they priced it for $12 and decided to up it to $18 before tax.

For lunch, you should get the ramen, now that's bang for buck right there. Not the best soup base, ingredients, or noodles, but it was all done right to a decent quality. For the cost, you get a salad, miso soup, maki(roll), and the ramen. My girlfriend personally got the oyster ramen, and it's definitely enough to fill a normal person. Sharing is whole other story though. We also saw the sushi/maki lunch specials, and they were definitely worth the price also assuming the fish quality was consistent.

We also ordered from the dinner menu, and I can saw don't order the sashimi, 35 piece set. The presentation was a bit sad and the variety a bit lacking. I expected at least Uni to be there, but it wasn't. Much better off ordering a la carte at this place if you want your money's worth for the quality of raw fish. Do not get the bento A dinner. It's $23.99 for a bunch of vegetarian food that's worth like $10 when you put it all together. It was tofu(bean curd) sushi, more tofu, veggie tempuras, avacodo maki and edamame. I was pretty underwhelmed. 

The only redeeming part of the whole dinner was their coffee/mocha dessert pudding, which was sadly probably their best dish. However, they did give us 7 this time opposed to 6, because they probably heard the disappointment in my voice when I asked about the salad/miso soup. 

Overall, this place is average at best, I would solely only go here if I was close by and wanted some  good a la carte sushi and the ramen. Definitely, not a place to go with big groups."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today,  after seeing such good reviews.  In hindsight the good reviews were for the sashimi mainly.  What we got today wasn't really outstanding and not worth the price.  The best thing we ordered was the Grilled Eel Pancake,  surprisingly. It took the longest to arrive but was nice and crispy and flavourful(with loads of Benito flakes on top).  The kaisendon was so small,  like child sized and I think it was $18.99 for lunch.  My Bento box was very underwhelming and that was priced at $16.99. The 4 pieces of sushi were just  shrimp,  salmon, tuna and arctic surf clam.  The octopus appetizer was ok,  not too chewy.  We wanted to order the blue fin o toro but was told that it wasn't served during lunch,  was available at dinner only.  Maybe if we had eaten that,  I may have given more stars.  I doubt I'd ever go back again,  especially for lunch.  There's much better places for lunch.  It cost us $65 plus tip."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant, however on a expensive side. I come here very often the servers already know what I order my heart. Only one waitress that bothers me. Rudely always stares."}
{"text":"This is by far the best lunch sushi restaurant i have been in GTA!!! Amazing displace, clear and calm atmosphere, great service, fresh food, very thoughtful displace desert and good price!"}
{"text":"The owner was rude and disrespectful to us. He told us that it would take 15-20 minutes to clear a long table with 10-15 seats. We felt that he would rather lose our business than seat 2 people at another table, as there were free spaces. Extremely disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I love Inatei.  It's not your typical all you can eat Japanese restaurants.  All dishes are a-la-carte, and are on the pricey side.  However, don't let the price scare you away!  It has a very high quality of food.  In fact, you can often find some types of seafood you rarely find in other local sushi places.

Do try their daily specials, and their cooked dishes.  Of course, sushi and sashimi were delicious and fresh.  They have some non-typical desserts too.  We loved their skewers, grilled salmon skin rolls and grilled saba!  

We weren't stuffed to death (as in other AYCE places), but we were all very satisfied with the meal.

Go try it for your special occasion celebration!

4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Going to this resto is a bit out of the way but it's well worth it. My old place was mi-ne... Not anymore. Food quality way better and service remarkably better. They have the best Shrimp Tempura and from what I had for lunch every piece of fish was fresh, nicely cut and very delicious. I don't get the bad reviews, must be customers looking for AYCE which really is trash wherever you go. Sushi for me is all about the quality of the fish not how much crap can be stuffed in a roll or how much you can eat for 19.99.

We'll done Inatei!"}
{"text":"Introduced by my friend, which is surprised by the quality of food, the 2 sushi chefs looks young, but don't be fooled, they are for sure professionally trained, restaurant is upscale decorated, very suitable for dating, or business purpose.  The catch of the day is written on a neon colored blackboard, which is quit pricey but yet you would not regret if you order, cause the sliced fish will come with as a decoration.  

The sashimi is very fresh, and sushi is a bite size portion, very suitable for ladies.  Portion overall is not big, combo for 2 would probably not good for 2 men, but should be enough for couple.

Price in my opinion is slightly expansive (considering I have a big apatite), but otherwise, it is clearly a rising GEM in this area."}
{"text":"Rip off. $20 chirashi with fake crab. What a joke. On the plus side nice decor and service."}
{"text":"We ordered the green onion and yellowfish maki, spicy salmon maki, and spider maki. All were delicious! It wasn't the run of the mill sushi. They all had interesting flavors! But the yellowfish maki was on the small side. 
We also ordered the eggplant and miso appetizer- that was surprisingly yummy and sweet!
For dessert, we thought we'd be adventurous and try this tofu cheesecake. If you like tofu..this is for you. Unfortunately, it wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be. Kind of bland. The chocolate sauce and almonds helped somewhat. Overall, this dessert was a miss for me.

In terms of service, they were very attentive and nice. But I care more about the food :P"}
{"text":"This place has a very high quality of the food.  

Black cod dinner is a good size and bento box B has a great assortment of food.  The sashimi is very fresh and the black cod has a slight hint of sweetness which is cooked perfectly.   In the words of my friend \"the black cod was awwwwwwwwwesome!\"

The atmosphere is also quaint and cute. I would give this place 5 stars for quality and atmosphere but it is a bit on the pricy side. Still worth it for a great experience.

This is definitely a great date place or taking out visitors from out of town."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Saturday night so the only seats available was at the sushi bar for two which I love since I can socialize with the chef and learn more about the food. 

Food was good but quality wasn't as top notch as other Japanese restaurants for the price we were paying. But overall ambiance, decor and service was good.

I love their plate setting and lychee pana cota dessert"}
{"text":"Simple and tasty! 

Californian in Toronto for work and Yelp ' this place, definitely worth the two minute walk from hotel ;)

Miso soup was spot on. I couldn't decide which way to go so I had the Spicy Tuna roll, Scallop Sushi and finished up with the Beef Udon."}
{"text":"We went on Thursday night after work and inside the restaurant was only one spot left. We were so lucky to get that last spot!

The sashimi is fresh, each piece got nicely plated and was sliced equally. 

The sushi are really delicious as well.

However, I feel it took a long time to get the food we order. 

But overall, the waiters are really friendly and willing to explain the ingredients the chef will use in the dishes. The fish are really fresh and the presentation for the dishes are pretty. 

We really had a great time and will come back again!"}
{"text":"I came in thinking that their online menu was a tad too standard for my liking. I enjoy trying new things. I was so happy that in the restaurant, they actually had menu specials (like special types of sashimi, etc.) 

I have a small gripe with Inatei though. I ordered in two phases (we were hungry, but I wasn't done looking at the menu). During the first phase, I ordered a sashimi dinner, a lobster tempura dinner, and their Japanese wagyu (A5) skewers. During the second phase, I ordered  yamakake, grilled ginkgo nuts, fresh crab chawanmushi, Hokkaido scallop skewers, and okonomiyaki. The man who took my order for phase two asked me what I wanted. I waited for him to take out something to write with, because I knew that my order was complicated. He didn't take it out. Instead, he asked me again what I wanted. I then started rattling off my order. Then he got rattled, asked me to wait while he got something to write with, and then we had to start all over again. Sigh.

Sashimi dinner - 15 pieces of sashimi (salmon, tuna, surf clam, mackerel, octopus, scallop, and what I believe was herring - the one that has the yellow fish roe at the bottom). Decent sized pieces. Quite fresh. Scallop was very sweet. Mackerel sashimi, I find, is usually quite dry. This was the juiciest piece of mackerel sashimi I've ever had. It was delicious.

Lobster tempura dinner - lobster tail tempura with assorted veggie tempura. Lobster tail was cut into chunks and battered. The shell of the tail was also battered. It is beyond me why they bothered with that, because there was no meat inside the tail. It was very misleading, because for that price point, I feel like there should have been much more lobster meat than like six small pieces of tempura lobster. Lobster meat was also tough. Liked the tempura shiitake mushroom though. Not many places do that.

Wagyu skewers - served in a small sizzling pan. 2oz for $25 ish? My first time trying Wagyu. Four wagyu pieces on skewers. The pieces were cut a tad thick for my liking, and because of the way it was cut, it didn't melt in my mouth quite the way I wanted it to. I was still recovering from my wisdom teeth extracture and I couldn't use my molars to chew, so that kinda sucked. That being said, this wagyu was incredibly juicy. Mmm.

Yamakake - chopped maguro (tuna) with Japanese yam. I didn't know how the yam was going to be served, but I took a chance. Turns out it was pureed. This had such an awkward texture. The yam looked and felt like slime. Served with wasabi and soy sauce, this had a pleasant taste, but because of the texture, I don't think I'd order this again. It was presented beautifully though.

Grilled ginkgo nuts - two skewers. I really like ginkgo nuts. Roasted, they're slightly addictive. These were slightly tough to chew on and slightly bitter. Probably my least favorite dish of the night. 

Hokkaido scallop skewers - Either Hokkaido scallops are very thin, or they took two scallops, cut them in half, and threaded the four halves onto skewers. These were okay. The spice they put on the top was a tad concentrated at certain places.

Fresh crab chawanmushi - chawanmushi is steamed egg, for those who don't know. This was served in an adorable little cup. There was definitely fresh crabmeat in there, and also enoki mushrooms. This was very light tasting, but very pleasant. 

Okonomiyaki - with eel. I never expected this dish to be labeled okonomiyaki. All the other okonomiyaki's I've eaten look like thick pancakes, quite on the yellow/brown side of things, and covered in okonomi sauce, Japanese mayo, seaweed powder, and bonito flakes. Inside, there's always tons of cabbage, and at least a little pickled ginger. This looked like the eel pancake you see on a number of Japanese ayce restaurant menus. It's a very flat pancake with no yellow tint. It is topped with eel sauce, eel slices, and bonito flake. The only thing that makes it resemble okonomiyaki in the least is that there were some pieces of cabbage in the pancake. Please don't get me wrong. This was delicious, and at $11 ish, I would get it again. I'm just not sure if this item is labeled correctly.

Two of our meals came with dessert. They gave us 4. Apparently, this is standard procedure for them, and I approve. Four dessert shot glasses filled with a tofu pudding with a red bean topping. I would have preferred the pudding a tad sweeter, as I had the red bean topping before the pudding and then the tofu was sort of tasteless, but all in all, a pleasant way to end this meal."}
{"text":"Service is great and the food is very fresh.  This is one of our go-to places in Richmond Hill for good quality Japanese food.   The sushi and sashimi is very fresh and quality of the fish is high.   Not the lowest price out there but \"you get what you pay for\".  The cod is great!

Great consistency in food quality, service and ambiance.  I have never been disappointed during my many lunch and dinners here.   They can be a bit busy so reservations are recommended during key times.

Definitely a must try place in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"I had bookmarked Inatei quite a while ago after seeing consistently high ratings from fellow Yelpers. Inatei offers good a la carte menu options for premium prices. 

Hubby and I were able to walk I on a Friday night and were seated right away. We ordered a miso black cod and grilled sirloin steak bento box and a sashimi set course. Salad and miso soup were brought out promptly. I appreciated that the miso soup was not overly salty. 

Our meals were served shortly thereafter. My bento box was quite filling, and I'm pretty sure hubby and I would have sufficed with splitting a bento box and perhaps some a la carte sushi or sashimi. The sashimi, especially the scallops, salmon, and tuna, were thickly cut and fresh tasting. The miso cod was delicious although I felt as though greater care should have been taken in removing visible fish bones before serving. The beef was tender and flavourful. The tempura was lightly battered and not overly greasy. My only feedback about the tempura was that I prefer a slightly sweeter tempura dipping sauce, but that's just my taste. 

Upon completion of our meals we were served coffee pudding for dessert, which I quite enjoyed. Overall our meals came to $75 including tax and tip.   Inatei is a little pricier than your run of the mill Japanese restaurant in York region, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The cold soba noodles are delicious!!! large portion with 2 full handfuls of noodles, with green onions, pine nuts and grated radish. presented on a large wooden tray that takes up 3/4 of the table in an ICE SHAPED BOWL for the sauce, the tray is huge and the ice bowl feel so extra but it makes it fun but I wonder if they reuse the bowl or make a new one every time. But the noodle are chewy and pine nuts added a great crunch, definitely something to come back for

They also have lunch specials that are also available on weekends and holidays. I've also gotta a sushi and sashimi lunch platter, it had a good variety, no fancy fish the basics but felt fresh. Also got a spicy roll which had a good ratio of rice to filling, good amount of spice but it does cover up all the flavors of everything else.

Service and ambience is nothing to rave about but ok, they have a large menu so lots to choose from but it is not the cheapest though for 3 people for lunch it was $90 although we were really full."}
{"text":"This place is BAWLIN' yo. Uni sushi be phresh like u never SEEN. I tasted one and i was like to the waiter \"WHAAAT! Are you serious?\" Mean girls waitin the tables, tho. This one chick wouldn't even let me holla. I was like \"please you ugly anyway.\""}
{"text":"Inatei is a pretty decent Japanese restaurant in uptown.  Although the owner of this restaurant is Chinese, the food they serve is still somewhat authentic.  The sashimi is very fresh and they have a good selections of fish you can choose from.  They have weekly or even daily special fish where you can order the whole fish and the chef will create at least 2 dishes for you.

Environment is very cozy and the seats are very comfortable.  Servers are very attentive and friendly and is always there to check if we are having a good time or not.  Food in general is decent for the price you pay.  If you want decent sashimi and sushi, I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"\"...awesome.\"
I like all the food there -- but the box sets are terrible! 
But still worth a try here"}
{"text":"Finally! A 4 star review for a sushi joint. 

I had their chirashi and loved the freshness of the sashimi. It had good variety as well: salmon, mackerel, shrimp, scallop, tamago, red tuna, octopus etc. Will definitely come back for this. 

Also, they gave earl grey pudding instead of the usual green tea ice-cream for dessert. It was smooth & not too sweet. Perfect ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"haven't set food in this plaza for ages so it was nice to revisit the area and looking fwd to try the other business in that plaza 

was wary to go there since this place seemed quite expensive but to my surprise it was quite reasonably priced. 

you get what you pay for on the menu and their combo does offer a dessert (albeit small). 

I ordered the Sashimi set. The rice that came with the combo was hot and the fish was really fresh. 

Service was quite good.  

Definitely recommend it if you are in the area or looking for fresh sushi at reasonable price.. the quality is definitely there!!!"}
{"text":"Best selection of sake in town. Really fresh sashimi platter and variety of fish."}
{"text":"Yummmm! I am so glad my coworker suggested this place for lunch, it was so good! We were on a time crunch as we needed to get going at 2pm and we got to the restaurant shortly after 1. The restaurant was still full but good thing there was space at the sushi bar. Our server was quick and served us tea right away. She was ready to take our orders but we took a few minutes. My coworker recommended the bento box lunch special and there were 4 to choose from. I got the salmon teriyaki with tempura combination while my coworker got her usual, tonkatsu and salmon onigiri. Shortly after we ordered, we got our miso soup and salad. The miso soup had fried tofu which was a nice touch. The soup itself was good, and tasted just right- not too salty. Our yummy meals came right after we finished our starters which was great timing. My salmon teriyaki was cooked perfectly while the tempura had good variety and was delicious. I absolutely love tempura shrimp and this one was definitely worth another piece. The star of box is definitely the sushi. I believe I had 6 pieces and they were so good! The fish was super fresh and the pieces of fish were quite generous. I was already thinking about coming since I really enjoyed the bento box! Nevertheless, my coworker enjoyed her meal as it was her usual and from the looks of it was a very generous portion of tonkatsu, sashimi and two salmon onigiris.

Included with the bento box was nicely sliced oranges which I thought was the last item (perhaps maybe green tea ice cream).....but ohhh my.. The nice surprise at the end was the earl grey mousse...sooo good! 
It was definitely a yummy and nice lunch and we were on time for our meeting..Another plus!

Thumbs up, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to ambiance, chic Japanese decor, cleanliness and quality, Inatei is among my favorites. 
Looking for a sushi place on Friday night can be difficult, but our group was surely glad we found this place.
To add to this, their service was superb and at times the floor manager came to visit us to explain some of the dishes and to see how we were which added a personal touch to the experience.
Food wise:
The presentation was excellent and quality was definitely above average. I ordered their Sashimi dinner platter which provided a range of various cuts from salmon, to dark/ red tuna, etc. 
Their prices are reasonable in a sense you're paying for quality over quantity. Those that were among my group were overall impressed with the quality."}
{"text":"Came for the first time on a Sunday night.  Got myself the Chachiu Ramen(sp?).  It wasn't that great so maybe it's not fair to judge over just one of the menu items.  

But the thing that got to me was that the service was a bit off.  For example, Nobody came to fill our water and nobody came to see how we were doing.  It was probably because it was late (9:30pm) and everyone wanted to go home.  Restaurant wasn't busy.  Another thing.. Maybe a pet peeve of mine, is no ambient music. It's just dead silent.  

We eventually asked for the bill and went along our way.  Not really sure if We will come back."}
{"text":"Atomosphere: The decor and ambiance has a very upscale feel. Dark woods and dim lighting. But the staff and clientele were pretty casual.

Service: The servers were very attentive and polite. Near the end of the meal though it seems they try to rush you out the door to increase turnover rates. The host even stood in front of our table with a new set of utensils and dishes for our table. We weren't taking our time either. We ate for 30mins and was out.

Food: I ordered: Bentobox B - $30
Grilled Black Cod fillet
Steak - 3oz approx
Tempura - 1 shrimp, 1 cucumber, 1 sweet potato, 1 eggplant
California Roll - 3pc
Salmon Sashimi - 2pc
Red Tuna Sashimi - 2pc

The black cod was amazing; crispy skin and sweet flavour. The tuna was very fresh. 
That's all for the good.

Tempura, steak and makis were average to below average.

The salmon sashimi was horrible. It was maybe frozen before but even so they gave me a cut of salmon that had no fat on it and it was chewy. Sashimi IMO should be served at room temperature. 


I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Quite and spacious restaurant. Good for business lunch. They offer bento boxes and sashimi bowls during lunch. They materials are fresh, service is good. If you are looking for a place to enjoy a quite lunch, check them out!"}
{"text":"Terrible services
The waitress is trying to push customers order something disgusting and expensive. The reason is that they have a very high inventory can't be sold to prevent going to bad."}
{"text":"Fresh, quality sashimi. Nice decor. Different designs of plates/cups etc. The only downside is the expensive pricing but you get what you pay for. 

For dinner, I like their selection of sashimi, particularly hamachi, sweet shrimp, saba and the yellow roe fish (what's it called??)

For lunch, I usually get the sushi combo that comes with california rolls and assorted sushi (or the one with additional 4 pcs of sashimi)

The pannacotta dessert is a nice touch to end the meal."}
{"text":"My family and I came here to celebrate a birthday. We ordered sashimi off the \"Today's Special\" menu (Toro and the Omakase) as well as a variety of appetizers, udon, and chicken teriyaki. 
All the cooked food was really good, however I didn't find anything special about the sashimi. I was a bit disappointed by the sashimi. It was a lot more expensive then most Japanese restaurants but there was nothing special about it and it wasn't particularly fresh. 
The service was spotty, we asked twice for our plates to be changed and they were very reluctant to do that. I've been to Inatei three times now and the last two times have only been so-so. There are better Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Great place and a great value! The sushi and sashimi are always very fresh and delicious, the \"omakase\" sets are very well priced, and the service is good too. I'll admit, we aren't always full after getting our customary sushi and sashimi omakase sets, but what you get is excellent. I like how there's a good ratio of rice to fish in the nigiri. We also tried the okonomiyako, which we found kinda interesting because it was different from any other kind we've had (was super crispy), and the negitoro, which was great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went to this place recently with my co-workers, it was different than I expected after all I heard it about it. The place was very beautifully decorated and the servers were very nice!
The food was much different compare to the Japanese restaurants I go to but it was definitely good. There was a lot of variety and everything was filling. The prices are a bit high but the servings are pretty good."}
{"text":"A major disappointment !
The food was  okay but hardly anything special. Just average. I tried spider roll, spicy tuna roll, green salad, and miso soup.  Tuna roll had too much mayo, spider roll was bland, and the salad was way too salty! 
The atmosphere and deco was cute and the service was amazing. 

I'd skip this restaurant though if your after some really yummy sushi rolls. Mi-Ne sushi is 2000000 times better"}
{"text":"What, I have not reviewed Inatei yet?  Now this is a major oversight, as I have recommended Inatei to so many people.  Inatei serves good quality and really fresh raw fish.  It makes fresh makis.  Its udon is al dente on spot every time I order it.  Lunch entrees offer good portion.  If you get one of the tables along the back wall, there is a nice sense of privacy.  

The decoration is a pleasant, contemporary traditional.  The lighting is slightly dim.  The services is polite and effective.  I always have a nice dining experience here.

Inatei is not the least expensive, but the quality/portion/cost ratio makes sense, so I will say you get good value.  Does it have a fusion or adventurous menu?  I don't recall.  But as a traditional, non-AYCE, Japanese restaurant, it is the safest bet to recommend to people every time someone asks me for one in Markham/Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"This place looks and feels very clean. I had the omakase menu (chef's choice) where the chef designs a special menu. There was a lot of blue fin tuna belly sashimi and really good cuts of fish served. Each dish was prepared to perfection and the seasoning really brought out the natural flavours of the fishes being served. Everything was freshly served and very well prepared. The waitress brought our 9 course meal in a timely manner and explained what everything was in detailed. The presentation of each dish was beautiful as well. Highly recommended if you're looking for a high quality Japanese restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place has a large selection of fresh fish but the prices are ridiculous and quality is mediocre. Beef sashimi was totally frozen, fishes were bland. Ordered uni by the tray and asked for rice, was charged ($4.5 per bowl). Definitely wouldn't recommend or go back, tons of other sushi restaurants with better atmosphere, quality and prices."}
{"text":"Nice place, seems more upscale than your typical sushi bar. Appetizers were well-received by our group. I had the tempura udon - to be honest I don't usually order udon and I'm not sure why I ordered it here but it was a little plain. The tempura were yummy, crispy and light. Salmon maki were fresh. We also got complimentary coffee pudding at the end for dessert. Overall nice place and I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Quite pleased with this place. On a Sunday afternoon I was expecting it to be a lot busier but there were many free tables. 

Chicken teriyaki with eel for $15.99 - I really like the portion of eel they give you with this bento box and the price is pretty good for what you get included with the meal. However, overall the portion is a bit on the small size and I found myself still wanting more to eat.

Pork Udon $10.99 - Udon portion is really small and the pork was a bit on the dry side. Comes with a side of salmon sushi.

Both meals come with salad and miso soup and also a pudding dessert.

Great food and service but portions are a bit small.

One thing that bothered me was that the waitress would be standing and waiting to serve customers but this one waitress always ended up standing right in front of our table and it was like she was watching us eat. She was in our personal space :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and was able to sample a try of three Japanese sushi cuts:  Kanpachi, Shima Aji  and the third I believe was Mangatsuo. They definitely have some of the freshest sushi you can find anywhere.  The attention to detail and quality is extremely high!  This is definitely the place to go for Japanese/sushi in Richmond Hill/Markham.  I have eaten sushi all over the world and even Japan and Inatei's ranks up there as one of the best!"}
{"text":"Grabbed quick takeout for lunch. The restaurant is nice and clean and service was helpful. I appreciated the tea while I waited.

The agedashi tofu was still shockingly hot when I got hone 15 minutes later. Delicious too.

The chirashi was tasty and fresh. A few unusual things in there but I did try everything. Yum. I liked that the cucumber in it was pickled with ginger. The scallop I saved for last and it was perfect.

Overall a nice place and I would return for a sit down meal any time."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Honestly this was close to a 4. However the $250 bill for 4 made me think second from giving this four stars, and the poor service we received certainly didn't help matters.

We chose Inatei for my dad's birthday. He's been talking about this restaurant for the longest time, but understands the huge price factor here (I would've given it $$$ instead of $$). We already know it's probably gonna be a once-a-year place. Nevertheless we still wanted to try this place just to see how it stacks up against other restaurants.

We had the tako sunonomo, bluefin toro, sashimi funamori, chawanmushi, beef tataki, grilled beef steak skewers, just to name a few. Before I start, if you order the sashimi funamori, you can give back the shrimp head to the waitress and the kitchen will fry it for you so you can finish the whole shrimp.

The tako sunonomo was very good, and you can tell the tako was fresh, not frozen. The bluefin toro was the reason why the price ended up quite steep, and quite honestly it didn't wow me like crazy, but it still tasted good. The sashimi funamori had decent variety, and the fish themselves tasted very fresh. The chawanmushi and beef steak skewers were nothing special, and the beef tataki was okay.

Our biggest disappointment of the night was the dessert. They ran out of pudding, so they resorted to giving ice cream for us...and the ice cream was the warmest, most tasteless ice cream I've ever had, almost to the standard of yogurt in terms of sweetness. 

Service was also not the best, as we were forced to sit in a table of 2 despite the fact we reserved for 4, and despite the fact there was an open table for 4 available. The servers also missed one of our orders, and at one time forgot to return our teapot. Otherwise everything was fine."}
{"text":"Good food and customer service but they seriously need to maintain their washroom was quite disgusting and was in dire need of plumbing."}
{"text":"Went back again, their pork chop (which was our main) was overly fatty. We couldn't make out the taste of the complimentary dessert, so we were disappointed. . Service was still great though."}
{"text":"I must have pissed off the servers that I got an extra slow service treatment!

The owner (or the manager) was very friendly with warm greetings upon entry.   It took me 10 mins to order as I got a biz call.  May be that is when they decided that I was an undesirable customer.   

Anyways, I waited 25 mins to get my bento.   I tried to talked to the server and she just ignored me because she was delivering food to other table.   IT was obvious that they were annoyed about me.  

I was by myself and got seated at the sushi bar in the location where the sushi chefs passed the food to the servers.    I saw all the dishes passed within inches in front of my face and had all the servers standing next to me - and yet I got no attention!

My bento arrived without the sauces - served by the owner himself.  I had to remind him that I needed the tempura sauce and a small dish for soy sauce and wasabi.   He was good to get those for me.     

By the way, I asked for a substitution from salmon to chicken and they wanted to charge me...   did not go for it.   

The food was okay and the whole meal took 60 mins with long wait to get the check too.    They probably won't serve me next time..."}
{"text":"First time here. Recommended by a friend 
Ambience and design is good. Ordered the omikase sushi and omikase sashimi 
Good portions and very fresh 
I was very pleased with using regular chopsticks especially if the restaurant is of a higher quality. 

The only problem I had was the sushi rice 
Very sticky and not well prepared. So it actually ruined the sushi meal 

Otherwise it's pretty good with presentation and service 
Will return"}
{"text":"The place was a bit hard to find. It's on the side of the building and is not visible from Leslie Street. 

The food is delish. Has a very different feel and most other sushi places. Everything is a la carte and no \"freebies\" like small soups or salads they bring you before your meal at other places. 

True to their positioning as a higher-end sushi place, the bill is probably going to be a tad heavier on your wallet than you anticipate. However, the food shouldn't disappoint you so in the end it's going to be worthwhile."}
{"text":"Oh wow !! Finally for order coffee that I need awake to drive.  Desserts are so champ which are Grey Tea Pudding and Green Tea Crepes!  Encourage u guys to order two best desserts!!!"}
{"text":"I have heard of this restaurant many times and expect a 4 star experience.. unfortunately I couldn't agree 100% today.

Place is cozy and the menu is authentic, sushi chefs are highly skilled. Service was prompt but wasn't attentive enough for me.

Came here on a Thursday night dinner for 2. Mainly focused on sashimi and dishes which aren't available from most regular Japanese restaurants.

Blue Fin Toro Sashimi Platter - 5 stars 
$33 for 6 pcs (2 akamo, 2 chu-toro, and 2 o-toro)
The O'Taro was melt in your mouth goodness!

Deluxe Sashimi Platter - 2.5 stars
Tako (octopus) was dry (a little bit stale but still sashimi grade edible), so it was lacking flavour
Maguro (tuna) was cut too thick for the part of the fish they used, so it ended up being chewy
Monk Fish Liver was flavourless - like super flavourless to the point where it didn't taste like monk fish liver?!
Hototagai (Scallop) was great, a tad smaller then I expected, those definitely weren't large size scallops, but they tasted great
Botan Ebi (shrimp) were smaller then expected as well, but definitely fresh! Fresh to the point I could taste the fish tank lol
Ika (cuttlefish), Sake (salmon), Saba (mackerel), Hamachi, artic Surf clam, were all great

Shrimp Tempura Appetizer - 4.5 stars
The shrimp generally speaking were HUGE, batter and crispiness were well done, zucchini, eggplant, and taro were great!

Futomaki - 2.5 stars
This was the only sushi we had, construction was ok, as you can see from my picture, it was falling apart a bit and lacking a bit of flavour and size to give it more then 3 stars

Black Cod Grill - 4.5 stars
Black cod grill is super tasty and almost always comes out perfect anywhere you go so long as they have it in stock. This place was no exception!

Fresh Crab Meat Chawanmushi - 1.5 stars
Steamed egg with crab meat..
This was a complete disappointment... where to start? I would say this dish is rarely offered and for the price tag of $4.50, it was pretty cheap considering the ingredient list.. these would be on the only positives in this 2 star rating.  The steam egg was 2 minutes over-cooked, killed the texture of the steam egg. The \"gong yew chi\" completely overpowered the steam egg flavour, the dish mainly tastes like a Chinese soup, but in steamed egg format - so 2 stars for taste. There were big chunks of fresh crab meat at the bottom which almost made up for all the wrongs, cuz it was only $4.50..

All-in-all some experiences were good and some not so good.. I would still recommend this Japanese restaurant, because of its menu selection. But this is how it goes in the real Sashimi world, you order tasters, then re-order the best tasting ones of that particular day!

Bill was $170 plus tip for 2."}
{"text":"This place is fresh and delicious. What more can I say other then will return and advise anyone to try it out"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had in the GTA. Fish was amazingly fresh. Pricier than most places but well worth the price tag."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you are craving for good quality Japanese food at a fair price. The sashimi comes in thick slices and are always fresh. The food is nicely presented and the ambiance is good to bring friends for a nice, unhurried dinner. The service is good and the servers attentive to our needs. Dinner always ends with a great tasting espresso pudding presented in a shooter glass. This place has become the Restaurant we will go to if there is a craving for Japanese food."}
{"text":"Definitely on the more pricey side of sushi restaurants, but this place has some of the freshest sashimi I've tasted in Toronto / GTA. This is an a la carte restaurant with Omakase, this place is quiet and felt very classy.

I went with my friend and we shared the entrees, I got the Sashimi and he got the Shrimp Tempura, they were each $23 and they also came with salad, miso soup and rice. We also shared a set of rolls that was around $8.

The sashimi was super fresh and it came with a variety of fish, including salmon, fatty tuna, albacore, and a couple other popular fish. They were all very tasty and literally melted in your mouth."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Inatei :) Now that my workplace is so close to it, it is often one of our office's favourite lunch spot. My boss also comes here religiously every week for lunch with clients too.

Food is always served hot and fresh, and nicely presented. I often like to try new seasonal items on their list of specials for the day. Service is always friendly and courteous; always a pleasant experience!

The following are some of my fave items!
- Chef's Choice Nigiri Set
- Hamachi Maki Rolls
- Chawanmushi (steamed egg custard)
- Grilled Black Cod in Miso Paste
- Chirashi (assorted sashimi on sushi rice)
- Smoked Duck Breast Udon/Soba

The highlight of all highlights at Inatei would definitely be the delicious complimentary pudding made by the restaurant owner's wife. The pudding, presented in a double shot glass, tasted silky and smooth. The flavour changes from time to time (I love the Lychee one!), so it is often a nice surprise at the end of the meal :)"}
{"text":"Overall their food is pretty decent, from sashimi to sushi. I love their seafood tower. soo good!"}
{"text":"The black cod was definitely the highlight of the night! The fish was a little overcooked but the flavour was superb. Everything else was sushi buffet quality (Matsuda Sushi buffet).

We ordered the bento which included a small steak, some tenpura, 3 pcs of a  California roll, salmon and tuna sashimi and your typical Japanese buffet salad and miso soup. Pretty much everything in that box was mediocre. We also ordered karaage which was HUGELY disappointing. The chicken was dry, the batter was too thin and tasted of nothing (real karaage batter should be flavourful and thick) and on top of all that-no mayo to go with it. Why?

The black cod gained 2 stars for this review alone! I want to give this place more stars but the price versus the quality of the food is disproportionate.

If we ever go back, it's just black cod and wine."}
{"text":"This place serves authentic sushi... top grade!
It is pricey... but you truly get what you pay for.

They have specials items such as Bluefin Tuna...  Raw Oysters... Raw Scallops along with their main menu.

If you are a sushi foodie... a definite must try.

It is part of a strip plaza with other food vendors."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi joint in Toronto. The ambiance is relaxing and classy, with fancy tableware and stylish decor. The service is friendly and fast. And the food is amazing. We got a sushi & sashimi plate to share, which I highly recommend. The seaweed salad is also tasty. The cooked food isn't quite as great - sushi and sashimi are really their forte. We finished off with the delicious matcha crepe cake. Overall we had an excellent time - stop by for some of the best sushi in the city."}
{"text":"I went there during Jun to celebrate my mom's b-day.  The fish are really fresh.
I like the interior decoration and all the servers r very nice.
The curry pork chop with rice is quite impressive to me that the pork chop is crispy but not oily and very juicy as well.  The curry taste is good and not too hot.  Overall all the food is good and it's worth for that price."}
{"text":"Always comes with dessert with whatever you order. Quality is up there but the price is also there with it. Seemed to be a bit pricier these days but for the quality it can be worth it.

Ordered the Sashimi dinner with some nice selection of fish, next time will try the 15 piece non dinner combo one to see the difference. Also ordered a scallop hand roll but seems like the seaweed could be crispier. 

I personally would prefer Aoyama for the price.

The plating was good too btw and also the atmosphere. More spacious than Aoyama."}
{"text":"When We arrived Toronto?the first time We have dinner in resterant?it's so good?delicious food ?fresh material?it's too much how can we eat?ha?"}
{"text":"Dragon roll is HUGE and delicious. They allowed me to do half salmon and half tuna on top. 

Vegetable tempura was pretty good too. It was cooked perfectly, but I prefer greater variety of vegetables. 

The miso soup is good, but very small. 

The 3pc salmon shashimi is excellent, quality fish, and good sized portion. (Sorry I ate it before I could take a picture!)"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE:

Quiet and somewhat upscale. Typical but classy Japanese decor.

SERVICE:

Servers were friendly and attentive. Food was not particularly quick but they are typically fairly busy here.

FOOD:

The \"Deep Fried Softshell Crab\" was not as well-battered as it was previously, and as such was a bit soggy for my taste. The \"Tempura Shrimp/Vegetables\" on the other hand were crispy and fluffy with the batter (YES I enjoy deep fried food!). 

The Ramen noodle impressed with nice presentation, flavourful soup, and tender slices of pork. The star of the show however was the \"Chicken Teriyaki.\" Yes, Chicken Teriyaki is one of the most basic and standard dishes offered at literally every Japanese restaurant, but the dish they served here was surprisingly good. Aside from the nicely grilled zucchinis, peppers, and onions on the side, the slices of chicken were perhaps the most tender and crispy I have ever had. This was a welcome surprise after all of the dry/tough chicken teriyaki I have had elsewhere.

I'll be back for the chicken."}
{"text":"I believe this is the place you go if you want fancy sashimi, but it's also the place to go if you wan to pay for fancy sashimi. So perhaps it is not fair that i am giving this place a 3 star since i dont eat sashimi and we spent like $150 for two and we werent even full and I had to come home and eat another meal. i suppose i just dont have the palette for refined Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Very pricey food IMHO. Better value out there. Won't return.

Good decor."}
{"text":"In terms of food quality, this restaurant is actually quite decent. However the service without any smile, jazz background music and hefty pricing makes it receive no more than 3 stars... And that's me being kind."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and I used to think it was okay but lately I haven't been impressed. I came with a party of 6 and the service was pleasant but slow. The restaurant wasn't very full so I don't know why it took so long for anything to come. The sushi was okay, but everything else was just not great. There was also no flexibility with substitutions which most other restaurants are willing to accommodate. I would have to rethink whether I will be coming back as the place used to be good."}
{"text":"Nice decor and the food quality was okay good, sashimi was fresh.  It's was abit smaller than expected with the price.  This place with more sake choice? it's good if you love to drink.

The service was just okay, wasn't that's good and bad."}
{"text":"I went there last weekend with family and friends.  We have so much fun and happy time with Inatei no matter from the atmosphere, food and the services.  We ordered lots of food that we usually did and the waitress very friendly and let us know what they had on that day was fresh.    They have fresh sashimi always and some new items that I repeated to order on that day.   I am special recommend the fresh lobster shrimp ball, so delicious.  Inatei always the best place to have lunch and dinner that will never disappoint my family and friends."}
{"text":"Dinner at Inatei is as good as lunch!

Dinner Bento Box B ($29.99) consists of Grilled Black Cod, Sirloin, Tempura, California Roll and Sashimi is on the pricey side. But all nicely prepared and delicious!

I really enjoyed Uni/Maguro/Ikura Kaisen don ($18.99). Uni was just so fresh/buttery/tasty. Portion is small, so I really savour every bite...

UNI..............."}
{"text":"This place had a very nice ambience and is very clean. It is owned by Chinese people. The sashimi, sushi moriwase we ordered was very delicious and it was super fresh, and very nicely portioned. I'd say it's more on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. 

Service was great and we were taken care of. Food came out fast. We had complimentary dessert which was awesome!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place because of its fresh fish and quiet atmosphere. It is her fifth time here. The decor is elegant and separated with wooden sticks. There's also a semi-private area. 

A small salad and miso soup was served first. We were given a pot of hot tea. 

She devoured her dish of raw fish/seafood with rice. She loved it!! I had the salmon teriyaki with a good amount of stir-fried veggies. The sauce was light which is nice. 
We both orders from the lunch menu which can be on the expensive side. 

The nice surprise was dessert: a small strawberry mochi ice cream. Yummy!!!!! 

Verdict: I would love to bring my partner here for a special event."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi and sashima (but pricey for its portion), grill salmon was a bit overdone and not enough fat in it to make it tasty, grilled eggplant was mostly bland even with the sauce, pork chop with curry simply tasted strange (mostly because the curry was not authentic.  in general, very average food quality, and generally on the pricey side.  Good ambiance and service though."}
{"text":"I recently returned to Inatei again for lunch, this time with my mom. We wanted to order one of their lunch bento boxes, but none of the combinations appealed to us. Luckily,the restaurant allowed substitutions with an additional charge, so my mom and I spent a good 15 minutes figuring out how to configurate our bento box to minimize our cost. 

I got their spicy salmon roll again, since I liked it a lot last time. There were ample salmon in each roll, which I was pleased about.

The lunch set came with the usual miso soup and green salad. In particular, the green salad was really tiny.  

Our modified bento included tonkatsu, sushi, assorted tempura and half an orange. The bento box was actually quite small compared to other Japanese restaurant offerings, but my mom and I didn't mind since we have small appetites. Originally, this bento box came with salmon teriyaki rather than tonkatsu, but we made the substitution for $1. Everything about this bento was so dainty and neat- even the tampura yam was cut into a neat square. For the price, I would expect the portion to be slightly bigger. 

Our lunch set also came with a scoop of ice cream. I opted for taro flavour, as this was my childhood favourite ice cream flavour and I've never had a decent version in Canada. To my delight, it was really, really good, and tasted just like the one I had in Asia when I was little! I think I just found a new incentive to come back to Inatei for, despite the steeper prices and small portions!"}
{"text":"Inatei is one of my absolute favourites for a Japanese lunch. My go to is the Sake-don (salmon sashimi and tamago) or the Chirashi (assorted). The ingredients are always so fresh and I've never had an issue with any of my dishes. Their sushi rice is also amazing. Lunch combo is great because it also comes with a miso soup, green salad, and dessert. Let's be real - the dessert is the most important part and Inatei knows it! The pudding is the best I've had no matter which flavour is being served that day. My favourite is the Earl Grey - it's chilled to the perfect temperature, very fragrant, and has just the right consistency and right amount of flavour. Some other flavours include green tea, soy, lychee and coffee. You can never go wrong when you go to inatei !"}
{"text":"A new favorite!

Um...wasnt expecting amazing service given it was an asian joint...(dont gasp, because most good asian restaurants have horrible service...this is from an asian myself)...but this place had awesome service! 

Food was fantastic. Some cheap dishes but the good sushi were well priced. 

Got 12 piece chefs special for 40$ which seems steep but really that is cheap for quality shashimi. It was divine.

Oysters were so good but I love oysters.

Other appetizers we got were unajiro (spelling?), black cod, grilled scallops.

They gave us free desserts. Ice cream for my fiancee and coffee pudding for me.

Ohmgod...the whole meal was orgasmic. Would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been to Inatei about 5 times since its opening and every time I regret eating here. It's not that the food or service is bad. Simply put, the high prices here do not justify the slightly average quality of the food here. 

My latest experience was me not full after spending $40 for dinner because the portion of the Kaisendon was so small. Please don't order it because it was such a huge rip off at $25. They gave me 2 pieces of tuna, 1 piece of uni (not very good, consistency was more liquid than a solid), a spoonful of ikura and a bowl of rice. You order those 3 types of fish separately with the same portion size and it should be around $15.

Despite finding the prices to be too high, I want to be fair and point out some of the positives of this place. I ordered a-la-carte sashimi and it was cut into thick slices. The quality of the tuna sashimi was much better than the one that came with my Kaisendon for some inexplicable reason. 

Other positives...
There are options to eat more expensive fish. The presentation of the dishes were nice. I like the restaurant's ambience and design. There was free miso soup, salad and dessert with the meal but that seems to be a standard for all Japanese restaurants nowadays. Service was never a problem for me as they hire a lot of wait staff."}
{"text":"Inatei is located near Highway 7 and Leslie in a plaza that is filled with other restaurants and eateries. I've been here plenty of times as the Japanese food is of higher quality and the sushi fish that they serve is very fresh. Service is always attentive and friendly and they do not rush you while you are eating. 

When dining at Inatei, we usually order some sushi/sashimi first and then find some small appetizers to share. We move onto cooked foods and rice/noodles. Everything on the menu is great and the skewers are also delicious. Price wise, it is higher than the average sushi joint but you are paying for the quality of the service and fish. 

Overall, try Inatei if you are in the mood for some good quality Japanese food!"}
{"text":"My friend realllly wanted to try this place out when we were in the area. Unfortunately, we didn't do enough research. We got here around 4pm and the place was closed, so we sat outside waiting until they opened. Thankfully they opened 15 minutes early that Saturday. We walked in and all the servers were lined up to greet us when we walked in, and we got to sit wherever we wanted...granted, we were the only two customers. I ordered the Sashami Dinner while my friend got the Sushi Dinner. The salad with ginger dressing and miso soup arrived first. They were better than average, but not drool worthy. Our dishes then arrived - my sashami dinner came with a bowl of rice, but I do not recall if my friend got one. Inatei really does serve the freshest raw fish around. It tasted great, and was definitely worth its value. My friend was turned off from wasabi being hidden in her sushi though. When we finished, we got an expresso pudding shot, which I really enjoyed. Service was very attentive. 

Their washroom has two stalls inside."}
{"text":"Best quality, attention to detail, fresh and genuine sushi restaurant you will find in Richmond Hill. 

Pricier than standard sushi restaurants, but IMO the value per $ spent here is leagues above anywhere else you can go.

Do yourself a favour, next time you are craving good wholesome japanese food (sashimi, sushi, etc) -- come visit Inatei and spend a few extra bucks to treat yourself.

It won't break the bank (nothing crazy like $100 dinners) but you will leave as if you just had a $100 meal :)"}
{"text":"Went here fairly recently for lunch with my family because I had read some pretty good reviews and this place didn't disappoint. From the presentation, service, to food, there's nothing bad I could say about Inatei! 

Portions of food were just fine for the price and the quality is very apparent when you compare it to some other sushi places. We ordered two bento boxes and a combo B:set B that came with sashimi, rolls, sushi, and handrolls. The spicy salmon handroll was really good.  Really good, fresh fish ... The one I wasn't too fond of was the mackerel/roe combo sashimi they have. The miso soup wasn't overly salty and even the dressing they put on the salad was one of the better ones I've had. 


If I was in the area with a craving for sushi, this would be my go-to place. I gotta say, the completely different sets of tableware on each and every table is also really cute!"}
