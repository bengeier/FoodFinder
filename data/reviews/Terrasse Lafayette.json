{"text":"To be fair, the restaurant apparently has a new owner and is presumably under new management. So I do not know if things have changed but hopefully they have."}
{"text":"The food is really good. We had the souvlaki, burger, pizza, and salads and everything was delicious. The service was great, the terrasse very nice to sit outside, and there is even a liquor store across the street to get your BYOB."}
{"text":"Great place. Really cool decor and feel to the place. I loved the calamari here. As well as the burger and salad I tried. It was cute how I ordered a cola and it was served in an authentic glass bottle. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"We liked everything about this place. The restaurant had the right kind of ambiance. Not too dark but good use of candles to set the mood. Our waiter was a prince. He was attentive and friendly and provided helpful suggestions when making our order. The food itself was amazing. The portions were big and the prices were very decent. The restaurant also lets you bring your own wine which we gladly took them up on. Our waiter provided a bucket of ice to keep it chilled and poured our first glasses for us. Very classy. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I like this place when we are a large group, the waiters are professional and friendly, the portion of food is large, and it's byow!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and prices. Pizzas (Lafayette Special and Texmex are the best), add a Greek salad for $4, no one person could actually eat it all themselves. The only restaurant that is byow I would order from even if I wasn't planning on drinking. One of the best!"}
{"text":"Take out. The spicy calamari was amazing (they allowed us to order those for take out despite not being on the take out menu). Excellent pizza (specialite lafayette) as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's not the most amazing food you will ever eat, but it's good and the portions are huge. So big that if I have a burger or wrap I always bring half home. They encourage sharing, so you can order a bunch of plates and eat family style. The pizza is a good choice for a group.  Bring along a bottle of wine (it's BYOW) and you're set.  The staff are friendly.  During warm summer days (and evenings!) the terrace is a good option for people watching.  They also do delivery and takeaway, so if you're feelng like some souvlaki or a pizza (I highly recommend the spinach/shallot/feta), just call them up et voila!"}
{"text":"I am so happy this place was next to my AirBnB. The pizza was so good! The ambiance is relaxing and perfect for a date or family gathering. They have many options on their menu and one of our meals came with dessert. It was an average price for a restaurant. If you live in the area or staying nearby, this place is worth to check out. The staff is really nice too."}
{"text":"The place looks attractive from the outside and the inside. It was not full but a bit noisy on a Friday night, so we sat down on the (quieter) heated patio. The meal started well, with good bread and fresh salads. It went down from there. Overall, serving smaller portions of higher quality food would be the way to go. We had spanakopita as a starter. Three pretty large pieces -- glad we ordered just one plate for two. It looked like a \"pocket pizza\". Too much \"cream cheese\"; I don't think it was feta. I missed the light layers of phyllo crust we should have gotten.  Then we had the regular (beef) gyro and the chicken gyro, served with potatoes and rice. Potatoes were more like fries. I did not feel like having something that fat, I ate just a few pieces and was disappointed. The rice was not impressive--and the chicken gyro was not either. My husband liked the meal better than I did--I think he had read reviews of the place beforehand and his expectations were not too high. The service was good, the pace of the meal was good too. But I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"J'adore ce petit resto! Attention, si vous y allez un samedi soir, il se peut qu'il soit remplie. Un bon BYOW. Les plats sont géant et très abordables. Je vous conseille fortement d'essayer les Calmars Frits...ils sont gros et délicieux et aussi l'assiette à partager pour 50$ qui incluent différentes viandes, patates et une mega salade...Bref , allez-y! Et le service est super aussi!"}
{"text":"Very happy to have tried this place. Everyone at the table ordered the #6 off the daily menu, which is a chicken brochette that comes with potatoes and veggies, as well as a starter soup or salad and dessert at the end of the meal. What really stood out were the small touches that made the food more refined. The twist on the Greek salad I had as a starter was great: some iceberg lettuce (but not too much), two types of julienned cabbage, tomatoes, pepperoncini, olives, and a healthy dose of crumbled feta in top with a great tangy vinaigrette. One dining mate got the mushroom soup and she received a huge portion. More importantly, she said it was very good. We also got warm tasty pita pockets as bread to start. Main meal was four very generous pieces of marinated chicken, some delicately cooked green beans, carrots, and parsnips as well as some very tasty baby potatoes. The meal ended with our choice of dessert. The chocolate cake I picked was a huge slice and definitely one of the best chocolate cakes I've had as part of a table d'hote. Super moist cake with layers of a rich chocolate mousse. Couldn't even finish it. I took a bite of the raspberry cheesecake and that was perfect too. Service was very attentive and polite, but we did have the whole dining area to ourselves since it was a very quiet Wednesday. I can see this place being mayhem, though, on weekends since the quality of the food is excellent and it is a BYOB. I would definitely recommend coming here on a slower evening to enjoy the food and not be rushed. Definitely a repeat for the BYOB rotation!"}
{"text":"Located in the district of Plateau Mont-Royal, this charming spot has the biggest eclectic menu I've ever seen for a mom and pop restaurant.  It's almost as big as SF's Cheesecake Factory menu.  My cousins chose to dine here to relive their childhood.  The restaurant has been there for as long as they can remember and the food is still just as good.  The interior is casual (think picnic tables), but boasts a rustic feel with brick walls and the aroma of wood fired pizza.   They are well know for their pizza and authentic Greek Food.  We ordered an appetizer dish with a variety of dips- but it is the tzatziki that I still yearn for.  It has a creamy thick consistency with the right amount of salt and not too watery like ones I've tried before.  I can still remember the tanginess of the garlic and yogurt, and the cooling sensation of the cucumber on a spongy homemade pita.  Can't say I was too kissable after devouring the loot :(  My sis and I also shared the Chicken Souvlaki which was perfectly fork tender, succulent, and extremely satisfying when dipped in tzatziki.    Service was excellent, dishes are reasonably price, and the restaurant is spacious enough to accommodate large parties.  I am definitely coming back to try their famous pizza.  You know what they say, you can tell how authentic a Greek restaurant is by how good their tzatziki is."}
{"text":"Resto de quartier où les portions sont généreuses (énormes et se partagent bien en deux, ou alors on peut vous faire un doggy bag) et les serveurs toujours accueillants. Menu pour enfant.  Le souvlaki, la soupe de lentille et le hamburger classique (avec pain maison à l'oignon) sont savoureux!"}
{"text":"We are visiting our daughter in Montreal and she took us here our first night.  We ate outside and had a great dining experience.  Our server was attentive and helpful.  We ordered calamari, pizza and Greek Salad.  Our server brought 3 large plates for us to share these dishes.   We are from Northern California and are used to good fresh food.  My husband said the calamari was the best he had ever had and that is saying a lot.  The Greek Salad was fresh and tasty with a really good feta cheese.  My daughter picked up some specialty beers from the market across the street to complete our meal since this is a BYOB place.  Our server brought us an ice bucket to keep the beer chilled.  The food was fresh and plentiful and the service was outstanding.  We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I order grilled salmon. The salmon was just ok! Nothing delicious! The side vegatables were cold! I won't go back"}
{"text":"Delicious. The finest spanakopita, perfect and hand spun; the best pizza & pita; divine chocolate cake. Charming service. I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Don't yelp this book by its cover. Although the decor is impeccable, the chicken is dry and the tzatziki is from costco. That said, the frozen vegetables are seasoned to perfection. Plus the waiter came home with me. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome BYOW. The pizza is great. Actually everything I've had has been good. Give it a shot. For the money you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great place with a great host. They were able to accommodate a group of 13 and we had a great time. BYOB, spacious, generously sized dished and with a store across the street for last minute byob needs. Come here with a group and have a fun time!"}
{"text":"Terrasse Lafayette has a wide sunny patio on a leafy residential street in the Plateau Mile End area, and specializes in large portions of generally super satisfying Canadian comfort food. These days we don't live next door so we're more likely to order in than mosey down, and our order of choice is usually the Lafayette Special lasagne (or switch the noodles for penne or whatever you prefer.) It's oven-baked, the regular size is mega, and the large has got enough cheese, mushrooms, pepperoni, bacon, smoked meat, green peppers to get you through a couple of those long, cold Canadian evenings well fed. Bonus - one time when they were particularly busy and our order took a long while to arrive they immediately offered us a gift certificate for our next order. Very thoughtful and much appreciated!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was not disappointed. I really enjoyed it. My boyfriend and I shared a pikilia plate which was FANTASTIC. I had the Greek grilled chicken salad which was super tasty. Service was great. Friendly staff. Good food. Byow. Not expensive. What's not to like??"}
{"text":"My favourite souvlaki in Montreal, a town known for Greek food. I always order in and from time to time mistakes can be made but the restaurant is very busy and they are always apologetic. I could eat the tzakziki every day on chicken, or tomatoes, or any other vegetable or meat. I order a side of tzakziki and use it for the week to continue the Greek pleasure."}
{"text":"Great new find.  Food was great. Portions large. Nice patio and BYOB.  We had calamari, pizza, honey mustard chicken, steak and souvlaki. All were very good. Side salads and veggies were nice.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Who doesn't enjoy a good BYOW?  Terrasse Lafayette is tucked away in a residential part of the Plateau.  The restaurant is pretty big and during the week it doesn't get too crowded.  They also have a large patio for the warmer months.  The menu is a bit of a mish mash.  They have everything from pizza and burgers to Greek grill meats.  The pork in my souvlaki pita was a little dry but overall it was pretty good.  I also really liked the roasted potatoes that they served it with.  They were well seasoned and really crispy on the outside.  The portion was pretty big and the price was reasonable.  This restaurant would definitely be worth the visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Awesome. Reasonable prices and excellent food.  Can be noisy sometime but you can't blame the staff for that."}
{"text":"We went for a bday dinner, we were a large group of 20 maybe?They didn't have many people in the restaurant and 8 pm dinner is a little bit late,so it should have been fine. Our waiter was confused and took forever to take our order, we got there at 8, and they took the order like at 9h30, and we finally got food around 10h15.  I gave the 2 stars because there is a little twist to their greek salad, and i liked it, they added some lettuce and green instead of just the regular stuff.Also they put a good amount of feta cheese as well.  The main course was a chicken souvlaki on pita with some mixed grilled veggies on the side. It was one of the most plain sandwich i have ever eaten. Pita was cold, not much chicken in the sandwich itself, just a whip of tzatziki on it. There were not much onions or tomatoes on it,and the chicken was not tasty and dry.  Dessert, a piece of lime pie, it was too sweet that pie.  Overall experience was bad and not go back to this place."}
{"text":"I live about a minute walk from here! It is my late night resolution to cravings. The restaurant has a wonderful ambiance and looks very classy- wine glasses and white cloth napkins. Although it is great for casual dining too! There is an awesome terrasse outside that is perfect for summer!  The menu is very eclectic and the portions are extremely generous! The food is quite good! I recommend it!"}
