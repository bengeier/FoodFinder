{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Price: 4.5/5  What does Le Painnamou even mean? The word is fusion - obviously the first part (pain) means bread in French, and the latter part (namou) is Korean for tree. Together, bread tree!!!! Haha. Anyway, the name suits the little bakery perfectly and as I love Korean baked goodies, this place is a total gem in my books.  The selection of bread they have is small but great; many of its selection is sold out when I visit too late during the day (tells you how popular this place can be!). During the Summer, my husband and I frequented the bakery on a regular basis to cool ourselves down during the hot and humid weather with their shaved ice dessert.  This dessert is very popular in East Asia, and many of the countries have their own authentic versions of this dessert. In Korea, shaved ice has particularly been more popular than ever during the last two years even though the dessert itself has traditionally been served for over decades. The modernized shaved ice is almost always sold in any Korean bakery or cafe you visit, and Montreal is no exception. Le Painnamou has had one of the best and most authentic shaved ice we had ever tried, beating its competitors in Seoul, Los Angeles, Toronto and Vancouver!  What makes the shaved ice at Le Painnamou better? Hubby and I believe it's the quality of the ice, which is pre-mixed with condensed milk then finely shaved to give it a dry texture that instantly melts in your mouth. The ice doesn't melt as you enjoy your dessert, which I find is very important. The bakery is also very generous when it comes to its toppings; we've visited many cafes where we were left with just regular ice at the end because there was a shortage of toppings.  Our favourite flavours are the green tea and strawberry shaved ice, but there are many more to choose from! Mango, coffee, traditional red bean, chocolate... there is a flavour for everyone and each flavour can also be enjoyed by all ages! And it's very affordable as well - the dessert is available in 3 sizes (small, medium, and large) and all are under $10.  Ever wondered if you can take the dessert to go?  Well, you can! Hubby and I visited Le Painnamou one day in September to find it completely full with no place to sit. We asked if it was possible to have it to go...and we were surprised that they were able to do it! After receiving our dessert, we enjoyed the shaved ice outside (it was still warm back then). We quite liked the to-go version; it was very well thought out and efficient!  So, before it gets any colder in Montreal, I recommend you head over to Le Painnamou and try one of their shaved ice desserts! Nestled right around Guy-Concordia, it's a great way to treat yourself after a long day of school or work, plus it's not that high in calories (at least I think...it's ice after all). We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!"}
{"text":"Petit *resto/boutique de pâtisserie/boulangerie Coréenne sympatique*! Les pains fourrés aux fromages et autres viandes m'ont fait penser à ceux de Coco Bun. Je ne m'y connais pas dans ce monde sucré/salé asiatique et je n'ai pas été \"flabergasté\" par les produits mais mon amie venant de Séoule m'a fait découvrir le Bing soo. C'est un genre de bol de glace râpé ( plus fin qu'un granité, on dirait des flocons de neige) sur lequel on peut y déposer: fèves rouges, fraises, mangues, chocolat ou appareil à base de thé! Le tout est couronné d'un peu de lait condensé et de petites boules de gâteau au riz ayant une texture faisant penser à un gummy bear ! Oui ok ça semble étrange comme mélange mais la magie opère en bouche ! Surprenant, rafraîchissant et léger! À essayer si vous passez dans le coin !"}
{"text":"As expected bingsoos are the best on a hot summer day. I've been back and have tried both the strawberry and the red beans flavours. Strawberry was slightly too sweet and red beans was somehow too dry. Matcha is still my favourite."}
{"text":"I loved this place so much, especially for their bingsoo! As I can't find any other places in Montréal that makes like them. Sadly, they recently closed their restaurant permanently. :'("}
{"text":"Went earlier today after hearing good reviews about the bakery on yelp. We got the strawberry bingsoo andbit was delicious! The shaved ice was creamy like it was made of milk and the strawberry was just so fresh! Combined it with the mochie and almond pieces made the desert a  very refreshing and yummy dish. We also grabbed a  couple of pastries to go and they were great as well. They had very interesting taste, sweet creamy and yet still savoury at the same time."}
{"text":"Friendly employees and very welcoming. Perfect place for a date. The food was great too. Totally worth your money and it's right in front of Concordia for students who need to unplug."}
{"text":"I went there a few times. Pretty flavorful bingsoos. Although my favorite is the red bean flavor, it was disappointing. It was basically red bean on top of the shaved ice. It was hard to mix both of them. Beside that, the other flavors have a layer of sauce which keeps the shaved ice flavorful. It is worth going there to try their sweets."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean pastry place~  I've been there many times and their patbingsu is a killing.  This time, I tried the Strawberry one. It became my favorite flavour LOOOL.  So fancy, the shaved ice literally MELT in your mouth. Food art is beautiful. Fruit game is strong.  Totally good place for a date or dessert after a meal.  I also tried their strawberry cake and green tea cake. Both are amazing. The flavour is strong. Food art is nice.  I also tried the red beans one. I was disappointed. Red beans are on the top and it's full of peanuts. It's not what I was expected.  Green tea and strawberry. Must try.  Kpop music on big screen. Ambiance is relaxing. Overall good experience. Best patbingsu in Montreal so far."}
{"text":"Definitely should try their bingsoo!! The portions are big and they are authentic and delicious! You can mix and match, but only red bean and matcha. The bakeries there are awesome too! I love the puff and the bread. According to my friend, the strawberry cake there is good too. They have a discount for bread after 7pm or something."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place several times and just keep going for the bingsoo. It comes in various flavours and so far the strawberry and mango ones were delicious. Unlike your usual shaved ice, this one is creamy and actually has a flavour of its own. Nothing to complain about the service, as they were pretty friendly. I would definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"This place needs more recognition! Today was my second time visiting this cute little pretty brand new Korean bakery on Bishop. My first visit I had the green tea bingsoo which is a Korean shaved ice. It was not too sweet, and was like a fancy, interesting, icy cold dessert with a mixture of green tea and what I thought were marshmallows but were (I think) rice dough/cake pieces. My Korean friend told me this particular bakery specializes in bing soo, so if it's your first time and you don't know what to order, go for the bingsoo! You will not be disappointed. They have mango, red bean, green tea etc. I'm not sure which one is the best, but I don't think you can go wrong with any of those options.  My second visit, I had a latte and pizza baguette, with a red bean bun that I was supposed to save for my bf but ended up eating a chunk of it with my latte. Both were quite good. They aren't jam packed with flavors the buns and the baguette, but it's still good. I think it might be a good thing because it isn't overly sweet or saucy.   The atmosphere of the place is very clean and modern. I really like it. I highly recommend visiting this bakery for a snack/dessert/coffee break if you are a Concordia student/live in the Guy area, or are downtown looking for a sweet spot to check out. Go go go!"}
{"text":"There was a week in October when I went for bingsoo three times. It was a good week.  I think I've tried all the bingsoos, but my favorite is the mango one!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is so good from here!!i tried the tiramisu,they made that better than the Italian,it's not a joke!!it's just so good!!and I tried also the coffee bun and the moka bread,delicious!!!i'll be back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"Their shaved ice cream is great! It's also a big portion, so I believe the small is enough for one person, or even to share with a friend.   The only downside is to make sure they understood your order, else you get something different! - in my case, I asked for the mango flavor shaved ice cream. But instead I got the green tea flavor one.   Else, it's a cute place."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends during our trip to Montreal.  I wanted to treat them to a nice patisserie but couldn't find one so we stumbled into this place.  We lucked out as this place had one of the best desserts ever.  We got the cream puffs, hot chocolate and the strawberry and green tea bingsoos (Korean shaved ice dessert). Highly recommended to visit.  Food: 5/5, best bingsoo I've ever had in Canada. Snowflake and light ice that didn't melt at all with multiple layers of strawberry sauce and fruit at the top with sweet condensed milk and rice cake.    Service: 4/5, nice staff and everything was available.  Ambience: 4/5, cool Christmas K-pop music with nice seating and very well-lit. The place also looked really clean.  Price: 4/5. $10 per person which is not bad; the food is really good and totally worth it."}
{"text":"Brand new (only opened 1 week ago) Korean bakery/pastry store/cafe. Many Korean specialties (chestnut bread) as well as Western delights:fudge brownies(yummy& just right consistency),lunch breads,from pizza baguette to calmari-stuffed blackish bread stick! There are several tables at the side and back of the store,the baked goods are well displayed,hygenically sealed,or glass encased,easily accessible, (the cakes and pastries are behind the refrigerated glass counter),and competitively priced. The location is directly across from the Concordia University's Hall building ,so come this school year,this shop should be doing a very brisk business indeed."}
{"text":"TASTE OF KOREA. I've never had such good Bingsoo in Canada before. If you're a Bingsoo lover, you'll be able to finish a small bingsoo by yourself! Green tea & just regular red bean bingsoo are so good!"}
{"text":"We ordered mango and matcha bingso. They used milk instead of ice. Best bingso I've ever had."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved their bingsoo!  It was soo good! The shaved ice melts in your mouth! I definitely recommend everyone to go especially in this very hot day in Montreal!  I tried the green tea one which I was very scared of my decision but it was really good. Next time I'll be trying the strawberry or mango one.  Bingsoo is a Korean shaved ice dessert that can have many sweet toppings such as fruits like mango, strawberry, condensed milk, chocolate syrup or simply sweet syrup. They're might be nuts for those who have allergies.  yum!"}
{"text":"The place looks nice, however, while I was ordering I noticed that the  man dipped his spoon into the chocolate pan, took a spoonful filled his mouth  and then placed his spoon on a tea cup.  He then proceeded to finish the desert  with chocolate that was ordered.  Then before putting the chocolate pan away he dipped his spoon a second time in the chocolate pan.  When I saw this I was in disbelief, how disrespectful!  I was disgusted!  I should have asked for my money back, however I ordered a savoury dish so I figured this might not be the same.  Then when my order came I noticed that the layer with white rice was not white at all  but  red  through and through with the sauce.  Meaning that the rice should have been white and the sauce on top could not have stirred in all the rice.   The picture in the front of the Restaurant shows clearly that the rice layer is white   Now I am wondering if I was eating left overs????????????  Disgusting not knowing if what you are eating is garbage or not.  By the way what I did eat was not tasty either."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The bingsoo is a must order! I don't normally like eating bingsoo that much, but it looked so good that I knew I had to order it. The bakery has very reasonable prices and everything looked delicious. :)"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now, tried the chocolate, pineapple and mango bingsoo. These are exactly what you need in this very hot Montreal summer! The shaved ice is very fine with milk favour. In addition, the fruits add another dimension to the dessert. Overall, not too sweet but super refreshing! This has become my favourite dessert place in Montreal.  The reason I gave 4 star is they can never get your name right, my name always ends up being very \"creative\", which is kinda annoying."}
{"text":"Went there for their Bingsoo (Korean milk shaved ice). Perfect on this hot and humid summer day. 3 sizes available. ..we were greedy and took 2 medium bowls. Don't be fooled because they fill - up the bowl so it's like double the portion.   If you are by yourself, take the small bowl. Medium bowl us best for sharing. Big bowl...at your own risk :p  Bingsoo flavor: Red bean (decent) Green tea Chocolate Mango (amazing) Strawberry (lacks flavors mainly because they use strawberries from the US) Pineapple   Also tried the sweet potato smoothie and the flavor was interesting. ..really tasted like sweet potato but not sure I will order it again. Tried the strawberry cake and it was good but not amazing especially for the price (over $5 for a tiny piece).  They also serve pastries, sandwiches and coffee. Definitely more pricey that chinese bakeries.  Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"The best bingsoo I've had in Montreal hands down. Very quaint little bakery but have never tried the baked goods haha. They have lots of flavors too, but red bean and mango are definitely worth trying. Most bingsoos are made on ice or sugared ice but they actually make the ice from some type of milk/cream base! Everyone comes here for the bingsoo but make sure to try the honey toast as well! I feel like less people know about it but its just as good fosho."}
{"text":"great staff, great place, great shaved ice A bit pricy but well worth the price"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! It's really clean and cute, although I wish this place was bigger so. They have all kinds of korean food and pastries. The staff was really friendly. I ordered a small chocolate bingsoo and my friend ordered a small strawberry bingsoo.(bingsoo is basically korean shaved ice, sounds bland but it's very good!) We didn't wait that long for it to be made. There's a television that plays kpop music videos the whole time, which I enjoyed a lot since I listen to kpop. When your food is ready, you have pick it up from the counter. Representation was spot on! It was well prepared and looks so good. The small was quite big for me so I shared with my friend (I usually eat little so if you want to share with a friend you can order a medium size) The chocolate bingsoo was amazing, it had chocolate syrup, almonds, brownies and pieces of mochi. The strawberry bingsoo, had slice strawberries on top with almonds and pieces of mochi, they had some strawberry syrup under as well. It taste amazing and I will definitely go back there on a hot summer day for their bingsoo!"}
{"text":"Cute little bakery. Clean and friendly. K-pop videos playing on a screen. Ordered a small chocolate bingsoo, but the servings are huge. Definitely could've split this with one of my friends, which a lot of people were actually doing while we were there. The bingsoo was served with brownie pieces and marshmallows . It was so delicious and refreshing! My friends ordered mango and strawberry bingsoos, which they both loved. Ended up buying a coffee bun (honey flavor) to take home. It was very sweet and moist. Definitely will come back, when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"After living in Korea for a year, this place was disappointing. They don't even serve Korean drinks. I've been craving a sweet potato latte for the longest time. I was also hoping this cafe would be more like an upscale Paris Baguette. Not so much."}
{"text":"I visited for the green tea bingsoo, the small size and I bought it to share! It was that big!!   The bingsoo is shaved ice (very very very fine ice shaving, like very fine coconut shavings) plus GENEROUS green tea paste. It's not liquid syrup, it's like ice-cream texture! And lots of it! By the bottom of the bingsoo, we actually had MORE green tea left than the ice. So we have to mix it further.  Very good service!!! The petite size bingsoo was about $8 but it's shareable. There are about 5 tables in this small cafe."}
