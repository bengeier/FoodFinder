{"text":"I agree , we always come here for dinner the service, food, and the prices are always good.  Yes, the manager always comes to our table and ask how everything is.  We never have to wait too long to be seated."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today with my mom.  Food was great-service was even better.  Server Brittany was Awesome!  Very nice and polite.  She's a keeper O'Charleys!"}
{"text":"O'Charley's isn't a place I normally want to go. (Side note: I have gone to the Mooresville location in the past for the house salad & loaded baked potato soup for lunch.)

Today however, my dad helped me get an elliptical that I purchased from a coworker, so his 'thank you' was a dinner of his choice - he chose O'Charley's.

We were seated immediately at the bar area & at 7 PM, the restaurant wasn't crowded. Sharrod was our waiter & was extremely nice & attentive. 
I ordered a regular sirloin with loaded baked potato & house salad. My dad ordered sirloin steak & fried shrimp.
Our salads came out & were huge! They could have been the meal. Mine however had huge pieces of the core & \"spine\", which I hate salads like that. I ate a few bites & was done. Not to mention, they were very light on the cheese & croutons. I don't recall their salads being this \"bare\".
Thankfully, the entrees came out & they were both perfect! Visually appealing, cooked as we ordered, & tasted good.
Of course, the yeast rolls were on point! 
Don't really have a desire to go back, but this was a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Everytime we come here service and food is always excellent. The one time my steak was overcooked I got another and our meal was free. The manager always comes around and asks how everything is. The prices are also very reasonable."}
