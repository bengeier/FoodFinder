{"text":"I like the new renovations they have recently made. Makes it a lot easier to spend time there! Honestly one of the cleanest airports I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is my favorite airport in America! Well, I haven't been to all airports obviously, but Pittsburgh got it right. Everything there is so easy to understand. You get dropped off in one spot. The baggage claim is in one spot. Ticketing is in one spot. There is a security line downstairs with some cafés and shops, but there is also a secret security line upstairs... You have to exit the ticketing area by the right escalators, cross a weird random street and go down a weird random hallway, but there is rarely a line there.   The tram to get from the landslide terminal to the airside terminal is easy to understand, and you're greeted by a big t-Rex skeleton when you get off. Up the escalators is a statue if George Washington and Franco Harris. You are now in the main concourse, which makes a big X that connects the 4 terminals.   I mean... It makes so much sense!!   The airport terminals have cool decorations of Pittsburgh-y things, like Andy Worhol paintings and Mr. Rogers memorabilia. Lots of places to eat too.  Have I convinced you to fly through here yet? I wish all airports made it as easy to travel as this one does!"}
{"text":"I hate this airport!! The security lines are consistently the worst I've ever experienced.  They have TWO tsa lines for the ENTIRE airport.  That's right, TWO!  I once missed a flight because it took me 45 minutes to get through.  And the parking is terrible, too.  The lots are usually near full, forcing me to plan an extra half hour just for parking and walking.  And the tram is such a pain...they are understandable in larger airports, but PIT can find a way around it.  I fly out of Cleveland whenever possible.  They have security lines for each airline, parking is WAY easier, and the airport is much quicker and easier to navigate."}
{"text":"good idea to Number to doors 1-8 so u can tell ur friend u will pick em up at door # bla bla, but it was very confusing for first timer from San Francisco. U have to walk, go down, then get on weird subway. But AAAA+++++ for rental car pick up outside doors about 50 feet, NO SHUTTLES TO PICK UP CAR_______YEAH."}
{"text":"Free wifi, lots of shopping, convenient 28X Airport Flyer into town, and generally not too many delays (this of course does not include weather-related delays, which you can't really blame on the airport).  Cons:   *Not many flights in/out of this airport.  There are very few nonstop flights available and airfare is consistently high for this airport. *Airport is pretty outdated looking.  Not a big deal functionally, but not so exciting to look at. *Security lines are always SO LONG.  (I fly a lot for work, so I'm basing this on flying into many different airports about 2-4 times a month). *Also traffic from the airport into the city, since there's basically only one way in."}
{"text":"This airport is super easy to navigate for departures everything is right there easy access. Arrivals on the other hand sucks, it is not bad as some major airports but the trains are annoying. There is a good amount of cafe's that can help you if you are stuck there."}
{"text":"On 12/24 at 6am near gate A17, an employee was supposed to be cleaning the bathroom. Instead, she was sitting ON the bathroom counter, looking at herself in the mirror, & blasting religious music from her phone, staring at everyone who walked in. I'd give 3 stars for this & also because the website has no information regarding where to send complaints. I knocked it down to 2 stars, because the wifi never works."}
{"text":"A cool airport surprisingly larger than it looks.   Lots of shops and restaurants. If you're staying at Hyatt Regency then eat in the airport before you go to the hotel, as the hotels not a great restaurant.   The dinosaur is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Easy to get around and well laid-out airport with little hassle. You don't have to walk too far to any terminal and there is a good amount of variety with respect to shops and restaurants in case one needs to kill an hour or so.  Free WiFi and all that jazz helps. I don't fly into Pittsburgh often, in fact I likely wouldn't travel through Pittsburgh on my way to another city. However, for those who do have the pleasure to travel through here, this is one of the better airports of a city its size."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is home.   The airport is very well laid out. It was designed to handle 10 fold the people that actually use it. Since USAirways left town several years ago, the place seems deserted.   I'm not sure who is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep at the gates, whether it is the airline or the airport authority. The carpeting at the USAirway gates is FILTHY.   USAirways also has the SLOWEST baggage claim. Plan on 30 to 45 minutes from the time you deplane until the first bags start to arrive. At Delta, it is not unusual to have the bags arrive within minutes of arriving at the carousel."}
{"text":"I fly into this airport a few times a year because I have family that live in Pittsburgh. I would give this airport a 3.5 because it's easy to navigate and for the most part it's pretty clean (some of the bathrooms by the terminals need to be remodeled.)   The main reason I don't mind this airport is because the security moves pretty fast every time I've been the it's pretty painless and goes by fast! There are several dinning options and the prices are pretty typical of a airport so no big surprise there. There is also plenty of shopping that you can do if that's what you desire.  The monorail to baggage claim is pretty easy to figure out and I've never had any problems there either. I also think parking is pretty affordable and seems to be plenty of it. The one thing I will say negative about this place is that it's been hard to find a decent cup of coffee and that sucks because most of my flights out of here are early in the morning....."}
{"text":"I had a 3 hour delay on my first trip from PIT to SNA(Orange County). I understand that the delay was because of a storm between PIT and my connecting flight in Denver, but the experience I had with the United employees at PIT was horrible!   Because of the 3 hour delay, I missed my connecting flight, and when I finally got through the line that was almost neverending to get to the counter, one of the employees left me standing there and a person in the other line ended up having to let me in to talk to the other counterperson.  Then when I talked to her, she basically told me that the next available flight was at 10am the next morning going into LAX. She was telling me this at 7pm!! And on top of that, they would not accomodate me for that night! So i basiaclly would have had to sit in an uncomfortable airport chair all night long!   The reason why I was going to Orange County in the first place was because of my parents wedding renewal and dual birthday party that would take place at 11am the next day! So basically I would get no sleep, and then have to rush out of the airport and make a 2 hour drive to Orange County from LAX and end up missing the renewal anyways!   Thankfully my brother called United directly and talked a woman into getting me on a flight to ontario that would get in at Midnight(I originally was supposed to get in at 8:30pm).    Then on the way back, I got lost in the extended parking because when I told the shuttle driver i was in 13, he dropped me off in the wrong parking lot!! I needed 13N and he put me next to 13A!! So i was walking around for an hour with really heavy luggage almost crying because I couldn't find my car and I still had a 3 hour drive to get home!!  Needless to say I will not be flying from through PIT anymore, and United definitely will never get my money again!"}
{"text":"Check in was a breeze with no line, but the amount of security on duty for a Friday afternoon was way less than it should have been. Longest wait I've had for security in years. Missed out on cocktail time. Most importantly, the bathrooms were heinous. Urine on the floor, rust on the AC unit, and just generally not well maintained. I found this to reflect the character of my Pittsburgh experience overall. Additionally, the single ply toilet paper is np good if you are in a mudbutt situation. Can't wait to be off the can and on my way out of here."}
{"text":"Who likes airports? Not me. Anyone else? I didn't think so.  Pittsburgh's airport is pretty good as airports go. Wifi, lots of food and shopping, and not the longest lines you'll ever see. But (and this is a big but) the stupid shuttle train thing to get to the gates is a major pain. It could be worse, though. This could be O'Hare."}
{"text":"One of the first airports to have free WiFi. Its getting better every time I travel. New shops, new places to eat, and renovations."}
{"text":"Very nice airport. It is clean and in my opinion a lot nicer than LAX, ORD, and other larger airports in the country."}
{"text":"United gates C51 and C53 are HORRIBLE!! Every inch of carpet is stained and many of the leather seats are ripped up. I don't know how the other gates are but this is really unacceptable."}
{"text":"A fantastic airport. Neither too crowded nor is it kind of a weird place. The security checks are generally quick, overall a pleasant experience everytime."}
{"text":"It's a very nice airport , that used to be a major hub for US Airways.  They've had to downsize since then, so there are not nearly the shops and restaurants that there used to be.  That was out of management's control, and the've done well under the circumstances, closing wings and keeping things generally from looking disused. But there are not the shopping options of a bigger place.  Pros: Clean, spacious,comfortable, kids area, never had a baggage problem, can change money, two security lines, enough restaurant options.  You can eat healthy and you get get a beer.  Plenty of parking.  Cons: Secuirty lines can be long, especially Monday morning.  Allow plenty of time then."}
{"text":"So I used to live in the 'burgh back in the day, even went to college there, so I definitely used this airport a bunch after I decided that the train and the bus were just a waste of time and flying was the only way to get to, of course, the west coast.  Even recently, 15 years after I bought it, I still use this tri-fold black bag that I bought at the Pittsburgh International Airport ... the best piece of luggage ever.  So definitely frequent some of the shops inside ... not a rip-off in price and the quality seems to be there.  Granted it's been a little bit of time since I was last there but I've heard it's only getting better ... clean, not too crowded, free WiFi, working moving walkways, etc.  The good 'ole 28X bus will get you there and take you back into town ... much cheaper than a taxi and then you don't owe your friend that favor for bringing you there at some ungodly hour in the morning.  Too bad it's not a hub for US Airways anymore.  I miss you PIA."}
{"text":"PIT, while much more quiet than it was say 12 years ago when US Airways was soaring, is still a good, clean and efficient airport.  The spoke design, as others have mentioned, makes it a very fair place to make your originating flight or connection.  The only real negative I can see is the free wifi service.  I could not achieve a decent signal anywhere in \"the spokes,\" so I dropped by a small cellular phone store in the sky mall area. They informed me that service is poor throughout the airport, and that I should set up shop near McDonalds for best results.  They were right."}
{"text":"DO NOT BOOK THROUGH ALLEGIANT!! This review is directly related to Allegiant. Please read this review before booking a flight with them. My fiancé and I were suppose to travel through them from Pittsburgh to Hilton Head on one of his long weekends. My fiancé is a state police officer and his schedule had to be changed. I called within 48 hours of booking the flight to cancel. First, I waited for an hour before getting through to someone. After explaining our situation \"the best they could do\" was give us $135 credit on a $490 flight. I was told I would receive an email with this credit within 24 hours. NEVER HEARD FROM THEM. I waited on hold today for an hour and a half and never got through!! Multiple emails have been sent and never a response. Spend a little more and go with a more respectable airline."}
{"text":"A nice small airport.  The brother gave me the heads up that it was built to be a shopping mall.  When standing at the X, it was very noticeable.  The stores are standard airport stores.  Bar Symon was a plus.  Beard award winning chef burger bars while waiting for your flight is about as good of a food option you will find in any airport."}
{"text":"Flashback 20 years ago, the first time I flew into PIT. Bustling, bright, and planes everywhere!! While it's still a good airport, I think even the crickets booked flights, and haven't come back. The lines at security can be long, and slow somedays, and smooth sailing on others. The tram moves you along quickly, and easily, and getting to the terminal/gate area is quite easy.  Overall a nice airport, with nice shops, and a better selection for food wouldn't hurt.  Don't forget to check out T-Rex, and Franco!"}

{"text":"Older airport, but going through renovation which is good. There are some very nice shops including Armani and Hugo Boss. Wifi is horrible!!!"}
{"text":"No wi-fi. A waitress told me that the airport wi-fi is free but there are often problems, and I couldnt get online for the 2 hrs I was here.  I would be so happy to pay for a reliable connection. Argh. With wi-fi, PIT jumps to 3 stars. It's easy to navigate, the rental cars are onsite (no shuttle) and it's clean enough. But unavailable wi-fi and poor veg food choices demote this airport from boring to sucky."}

LAME.  and the fact that all the decorations are so old...and ugly.  ughhhh.  i like to consider myself fairly well-traveled (london, paris, prague, san fran), but i dislike this airport.  maybe it was just because i had no idea we had to take a train to exit, and because i was REALLY FREAKING EXCITED to see my bff for new years, but i was just super bummed i had to wait for a train.  lamesauce.  and the luggage took ages to finally get to us.  *sigh*"}
{"text":"A pretty good airport.  Plenty of restaurants and shopping to keep you busy while you wait for your flight."}
{"text":"Very clean airport, staff helpful and courteous. Easy to make your way around.  Flights are generally on time in and out, security is slow as usual (TSA )"}
{"text":"I have yet to experience a better airport. PIT is clean, bright, and well-organized. There are a range of dining options from a quick snack at McDonald's to a \"fast casual\" meal at one of the dine-in restaurants here. The presence of a CVS has saved me on many a trip when I needed some toiletry item last-minute.  The wi-fi is free and actually works, and this is one of the few airports I don't mind waiting in because it is so comfortable. There is excellent shopping here and it is fun to check out Bath & Body Works or The Gap while waiting for a flight.  The signage is clear and it is easy to figure out where you need to be and how to get there. The short-term parking, by the way, is very cheap: $1 for the first hour.  Truly, I cannot think of a single complaint about this airport."}
{"text":"Based on regulations, most airports are pretty much the same in terms of lines, procedures and aggravation. The friendliness and light-hearted nature of the TSA agents stood out for me.  While they were still taking their job very seriously, I appreciated their ability to make the process more enjoyable for the travelers. \"If you still have stuff in your pockets, then your pockets aren't empty,\" one agent joked.  Otherwise, it's your standard international airport. Some parts (and restrooms) were clearly more modern than others, but I feel that's pretty standard with airports across the country.  You don't go someplace just to visit an airport but I wouldn't dread going to Pittsburgh because of it."}
{"text":"Very nice time at Martini, enjoyed Dirty Martini and some scotch.  Excellent product and outstanding service at Vino Vollo, an amenity that is very much appreciated.  Flight delay gave us a chance to enjoy Bar Symon for a quick meal which I would recommend highly."}
{"text":"Ah... PIT. An airport designed for ORD-levels of traffic that services 10% as much. I think a lot of why PIT shines is because of the space and comfort that come along with a high-capacity airport servicing a small number of flights... and it's a really nice departure from jamming through crowds at CTL, PHL, JFK, and many other busy American airports.  Everything about PIT screams pre-9/11 airline hub: massive post-security shopping areas, upper deck \"air-side\" with airline lounges, international arrivals greeting area airside which lets out almost directly at the train to take you to the land side, three enormous parallel runways capable of receiving 80 flights/hr, baggage carousels for days, and a disproportionately small security checkpoint.  The place is huge. 100 gates across four concourses, extended like appendages off a core filled with shopping, food courts, and pubs. If you have a flight which arrives at PIT late, it can almost be a little unnerving to walk through the semi-darkened terminal with no-one but the fellow travelers from your flight around.  Then there's the land-side terminal, connected to the air-side terminal by two parallel trains which ferry passengers. The airline service desks (check-in, ticketing) are upstairs, and the security checkpoint is downstairs. The security checkpoint can become weirdly congested at times -- about half the time I'm flying out of PIT, the security line extends all the way back to the information desk and sometimes beyond. The TSA Pre line can appear even worse, as it doesn't switch back on itself; still, I've found that even when that line was extremely long, it moves very quickly. Speaking of TSA Pre: there's an enrollment office for TSA Pre and Global Entry at PIT, up near the airline service desks. I was able to get an appointment there without too much trouble, as opposed to the 4-6 months that SFO was booked out...  Beware if you plan to fly into PIT and check a bag. If you're short on time, the baggage claim can be VERY frustrating -- it's easily the slowest experience I've had so far. I don't usually mind waiting, but if you need to get moving right after you land, you're in for a lousy time."}
{"text":"After being at a selection of other airports Pgh airport is very organized.  They do a good job keeping everyone moving."}
{"text":"This airport is the training airport for the TSA in the region, so you should plan ahead and give yourself ample time on your journey. While the airport itself is a bit disjointed, it's a decent airport overall.   It's a medium sized airport with a couple restaurants for food.   When I was here last, Southwest had cancelled several flights and didn't bother to let us know until we drove all the way up there to check in.   I've heard some horror stories of travels gone awry here, but I've not had too many myself."}
{"text":"I take a lot of flights that depart at 6am.  It's usually dark at 6am.  It is often difficult to distinguish between dark brown and black at 6am.  If I love a pair of shoes in black I will sometimes buy the same pair in brown.  You see where this is going, right??  Well, I didn't until I got off the plane in Pittsburgh and realized I was wearing one black and one dark brown shoe.  I'm normally indifferent to the mall-esque nature of airports.  Give me a bookstore and a bar and I'm happy.  However, I've never been happier to see a 9 West shoe store in my life let alone in the middle of an airport.  I've flown in and out of PIT at least 20 times and this is one of my favorite semi-sizable airports. Security and rental car pick-up and return are a breeze (no shuttle.) Not too far from downtown.  Wi-Fi's free, the airport's really clean and there are food options that will not make you wish you hadn't just bought \"Fast Food Nation\" in the airport bookstore."}
{"text":"Airports could be a lot worse. I flew in and then tried to fly out. Twice. Not the airport's fault, of course. Hence I have spent a lot of time in the actual airport. Here's what I like: - There's a full Rite-Aid in one of the terminals. How great is that? I wish more airports had those. - Plenty of food options. - Generally not that crowded. - Bathrooms cleanish. - Free (if sometimes slow) Wifi - The Delta staff I dealt with for awesomely friendly and helpful. Almost shockingly so. - The security line has a \"one bag\" line. Nice. - There's a statue of Franco Harris in the airport!"}
{"text":"Best airport! Rental cars on site, easy parking, superb behind the gate shopping...wonderful bar, Martini, before all the gates...great drink assortment too! I had the Salty Chihuaha! Service is quick in all areas if airport. Feels modern and clean. Looks like they have a stage where musicians can play, however on my 2 visits have not seen anyone performing. Hint! Second TSA checkpoint upstairs and usually not crowded at all...however this morning that station was not accomodating TSA PRE but still worth a shot!"}
{"text":"When I pass through this airport, I'm reminded of a TV commercial from the 1990s that listed various quirky \"best ofs\" and Pittsburgh airport won the \"best public telephone bank\" category.  Those huge banks of telephones are still there (though some phones have been removed).  This kind of sums things up.  This airport was built on a massive scale in the early 1990s and handled relatively large amounts of traffic during that decade as US Airways' primary hub.  It had non-stop flights to almost all corners of the US as well as several international flights to Europe - not bad for an airport located by only a mid-sized city.    Then things went south starting around the late 1990s.  US Airways had been gradually expanding its hub in Philadelphia (a terrible airport, by the way, but one with much more business) and realized that it would be wise to shift more and more flying capacity over there.  Essentially, Philadelphia replaced Pittsburgh as the primary Northeast hub for US Airways.  Then, the America West merger added a major hub at Phoenix and US Airways shifted its focus towards being more of a national airline than primarily an East Coast one.  When the dust settled, Pittsburgh airport was de-hubbed, leaving what many have termed a \"white elephant\".  So what's great about a white elephant?  Actually quite a lot.  Because the place is nowhere near as crowded as it was built for, there is essentially no issue of people running around, getting in your way, etc.  Security lines are relatively minimal.  Lines at the stores and restaurants are also small and there are plenty of stores - thanks to the fact that this airport once had huge amounts of traffic and was built to be the Mall of America of airports.  The concourses are extremely wide and relaxing.  Plus, the airport was built in an efficient \"X\"-pattern which makes getting from one concourse to another a breeze.  Also wisely, you do not have to exit the secured area when transferring between gates.  For transiting through, there are fewer better airports.  The downside?  My main complaint is the extremely sloooooow baggage retrieval system.  Again, thanks to the airport once being very busy and still being very huge, they built what was a state-of-the art (for 1992) automated system.  The problem is that the system is very slow.  From my experience, it takes usually at least 15-30 minutes after you flight has arrived at the gate for the baggage to even start trickling down the belt.  A search through the internet reveals some horror stories of people waiting over an hour and sometimes TWO HOURS for the bags to come out.  When the bags do come out, they come out very slowly.  It seems to be a minute per bag but its probably more like 15-30 seconds.  Either way, it can feel like an eternity if you are on a large plane and bags are coming out in a manner resembling the 1970s Pong video games.  What's worse is that there are often long pauses wherein, after a batch of 10 or so bags are delivered at the excruciatingly slow rate described above, there will be a period of several unnerving minutes (5-10 minutes) when no bags come out before the next batch finally comes out. This automated system is living proof that machines can't replace humans.  Further, since the airport sees so little traffic now, it will not likely be upgrading this system anytime soon.  I often try to avoid this system by bringing only carry-on if I'm terminating my flight in Pittsburgh.  The trouble is, thanks to dehubbing, many flights to Pittsburgh now use regional jets which require you to check in (albeit without a fee) your carry on.  The other downside is that, since this airport is built on a massive scale, it is far far far away from the city center - in fact a new highway was built just to reach it.  This is reminiscent of the Denver airport.  Not bad if your final destination is on the western side of the city and you can drive.  However, if you are going Downtown and don't have a car, your options are either an expensive cab ride or a ride on the public bus.  The bus itself is pleasant enough but arrives once every 30 minutes - so expect yourself to be waiting 15-45 minutes for your bags (missing a bus or two  in the process) and then waiting another 15-30 minutes for the bus.  The third downside is that, since de-hubbing, there is a dearth of non-stop flights from Pittsburgh.  Also, the only overseas non-stop destination is Paris, which is good enough if you're going to Paris but it means that you will have to deal with the chaos of Charles de Gaulle Airport if you're transferring to anywhere else on that side of the pond.  Overall though, this is a decent airport.  For transiting through - where you don't have to deal with the annoyance of the baggage retrieval system or going to the city - it is one of the best.  However, the terrible baggage system, dearth of non-stop flights, and the poor transportation options make this airport a 3 star rather than a 4"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh airport is very spacious and clean! I always enjoy passing through.   The terminals have lots of space for each airline and I never have issues getting around.   They just built new food places in some of the terminals! Lots of shops and restaurants to choose from.   They have cool pieces of art throughout the airport as well that you can look at! HOME OF THE STEELERS!   Parking is easy to figure out, and there's plenty of surrounding areas to stay at near the airport."}
{"text":"Tuskegee Airmen Memorial between gates 4 and 6 in terminal A.  It makes me sad knowing what they were willing to sacrifice for this country and what the would be coming home to in the '40's...not that it's much better in the new millennium."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself for a Walking Dead experience if you land anytime after 8pm. Everything is closed. Unfortunately, this large airport has had the number of flights it runs cut significantly which I causes the place to always seem empty / abandoned. No unique or good food options is also a frustrating."}
{"text":"This is my home airport. It recently won Airport of the year - but I wonder how? Still billed as an international airport, it's truly more like a regional airport. Limited carriers and limited direct flights out of Pittsburgh. With improvements made over the last several years it is slowly becoming more modernized. Decent selection of shops and restaurants are available but most everything closes very early. So if you have a late connecting flight or a late arrival, you better pack a lunch. Most of the gates still lack charging stations that are convenient to seating. It seems as though flights arriving after 10 PM luggage pick up is limited to one carousel which increases the time to find your checked bags now commingled with other arriving flights. Keeping my fingers crossed for continued improvements."}
{"text":"The Pittsburgh airport is okay. It's pretty easy to navigate (although I'll admit I was confused about the train that takes you to the gates after you pass through security the first time I flew here) and there is a decent selection of restaurants and shops.  It is not so conveniently located to the city, which is sort of annoying, and the seating areas are pretty old and rough looking. Compared to other airports that have charging stations under seating in the gates, the Pittsburgh airport looks kind of ancient. (Or maybe I've just never been in any of the good gates?)  Fortunately, there is free WiFi, which is huge in my book. Also, if you go when the security lines are bad (and sometimes, they are really bad and backed way up to the point where I've seen them going out the doors into the walkways that connect to the parking lot....which is inefficient), there is actually also an alternate security checkpoint upstairs and across the way where the line is always MUCH better. I like the alternate security checkpoint because not everyone knows about it, and they move things along pretty quickly. It's definitely good for those more rushed mornings I've spent in the airport.  Because of the location, you'll probably either need someone to pick you up, or you can rent a car. There's public transportation, as well, but it takes foreeeeever."}
{"text":"I was in and out of this airport so fast that I can't remember much -- and that is THE best review you could ever give an airport.  I was running late for a 9am flight back to JFK and was relieved to find the rental car drop-off positioned directly outside the terminal.  Of course I managed to lose my cell phone in the car which wasted several more (frantic) minutes but that was more than made up for by the handy dandy multi-airline self check-in terminal I found just inside the door.  Security was a breeze and the TSA staff were all smiles (where the hell am I?).  The best BEST(!) thing of the whole experience is this:  there is a separate line for people with one bag at security.  Seriously!  It was as good as the first class lines I've seen at other airport security checkpoints... except us frugal folk can use this one.  I generally plan to get to the airport an hour and a half before departure.  I think I got to PIT more like 45 minutes before departure and as freaked out as I was, I really didn't need to be.  I made it from rental car drop to check-in kiosk to security to my seat on the plane in LITERALLY 15 minutes.  I'm not even sure how that is possible.  Is that enough to make this New Yorker contemplate a move to Pittsburgh?  No... but it sure makes the idea of another visit sound much more appealing.  Bravo PIT!"}
{"text":"I've been here thrice now.  Airport seems to be clean, not so crowded, organized, rental counters are conveniently near baggage claim downstairs, unlike others where you have to take a f&$@ing shuttle, plenty of hotel shuttles, ride-share avail', and plenty of restaurants and some bars.  I had an early-bird flight and they literally had fast food and coffee shops open at 4am!  TSA line wasn't too long and wasn't a hassle.  Ticketing was convenient and efficient.  I look forward to more flights to/from PIT."}
{"text":"I love this airport! Everything is so clearly marked, TSA always moves so quickly, and everyone who works here is so friendly. From getting dropped off at check in, to getting picked up at baggage claim, everything just moves so smoothly and organized. definitely one of my favorite airports"}
{"text":"Biggest warning to those flying through PIT - if you are leaving between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. on a Thursday or Friday evening, give yourself 90 minutes (or more) - the security lines here are simply horrible at that time of day.    Onto the positives - there are nice dining and shopping options here (not sure how the retailer stay afloat here though).  This used to be a major hub and it is sad to see entire wings boarded up - so much unused capacity here, which is a shame.  Trivia fact - reason why air traffic is so low here is because PIT has the second highest landing fees in the US (after EWR)."}
{"text":"A lot of construction here right now, clearly they're trying to spruce it up.  It's not quite as funky as Oakland airport, which is still my favorite, and it's also a big-ass distance from the city center which is a big minus.    Still, there are a couple of nice options here for vegans foodwise, and we had a nice chat with a guy in one of the places.  We also narrowly missed the local classic music radio station putting on a performance, and they're also pushing for people to visit to just shop.    Still, the distance is a killer, but they're making an effort."}

The security line was the worst I've ever experienced and I didn't appreciate that I had to figure out where the check in was (on the upper floor which is away from the entrance that you walk in from the hotel and parking lot which, when I was there, was blocked by the security line anyway).  Its not a nightmare but this fairly frequent flyer (2-8 times a year) thinks \"Meh. I've experienced better\" is very very true."}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite airports to travel to, from or through. I first started flying into here when I went to WVU and will occasionally fly in when I want to go back to Morgantown to catch a game. The airport is very clean but it's also very 80's with grey and red decor on the first and second floor. I love the Pittsburgh displays they have set up around the airport like the Mr. Rogers Neighborhood display and the Andy Warhol one. Thanks to the Sky mall there is tons of shopping options along with dining options in both the center of the airport and each terminal. Airport is very easy and very quick to get around since everything is located right there with the only tram being from the terminals to and from baggage and security. The only thing that peeves me is the security lines suck here-I don't know why they are so slow or why they don't have more people on it. Also, I know why the free wifi is free: because it's the slowest wi-fi I've ever been on. I was waiting for the dial up tone that I used to hear when I first started using the Internet to come on because yeah, that slow."}
{"text":"So easy to get around this airport.  Big airport feel with little airport ease.  No time consuming rental car shuttles, friendly people, very nice re-do of the central area with shops like Boss, Desigual, Lacoste, etc.  also quick access to parking and after dealing with Boston Logan or even worse, Newark, this is a very welcome change.  I do wish it had a chain coffee shop thus 1 star less."}
{"text":"PIT is legIT. They had free wifi long before most other airports, and plenty of little shops and restaurants to keep you entertained for a few hours. (But I see conflicting reviews about this- is it no longer free? It was last time I came through..?)  When you arrive, you will be greeted by George Washington and Franco Harris on the way to baggage claim. Real American Heroes.  Security line is either a total breeze, or backed up to the short-term parking entrance. But it moves fast! Having one security entrance for the entire airport isn't ideal, but you won't be stuck in one terminal deciding between two food options (looking at you, Logan). You are free to roam around and explore. So go have an Iron City at one of the little bars or relax on a brookstone massage chair.  Word of warning: the shops and restaurants pretty much shut down by 7:30pm, which is really lame if you're trying to get your pre-flight eat/drink on. So if you have a later flight, eat beforehand!"}
{"text":"I'm old enough to vaguely remember the old asbestos filled 70's airport prior to this one so I still think of this as the \"new\" airport even though that's clearly not true anymore. I first noticed signs of aging in my most recent visit after coming from a newer airport (DIA - Denver), but didn't have any problems and was still able to find fairly reasonable food and drink [for an airport]. I have a soft spot for this place as my family used to treat it like a mall in pre-9/11 days when that was still possible. I loved riding the train and going to the nature store back when that was a thing. Even though things have changed, I have no real complaints other than physical aging of the facilities. I can usually get a ride, so parking is a non-issue. Not my favorite part of the world, but home base all the same."}
{"text":"I lived in Pittsburgh for about three years, and, as a frequent flyer, this airport practically became my second home.  Overall, it's not a bad airport -- Not great, but not bad either.  The pros: -- Super easy to get in and out of.  The on-site parking is quite manageable.  Even pick-ups and drop-offs are typically headache-free. --Security is usually a quick and painless process.  Yes, TSA is a pain at times, but their asshattery is a little less prominent here. --A Rite Aid is in the terminal.  Go here for CHEAP water (On sale, sometimes it's only 50 cents a bottle.  Yes, 50 cents at an airport!!!) and CHEAP snacks. --Rarely crowded --Car rentals are on site, making the rental and return process quick and easy. --Super cool T-Rex skeleton near the escalators heading up to the terminal.  RAWR!  Cons: --Food selection isn't fantastic.  But, what did you expect from an airport? --Really dated décor that certainly doesn't infuse the place with a happy, airy vibe. --The seats of some chairs are quite worn and cracked . --The shops and restaurants are not open late.  So, if you get massively delayed, you better have planned ahead and brought a sandwich or somethin'. --Awfully slow baggage claim.  Like, reaaaallly slow.  All in all, not a bad place to fly in and out of."}
{"text":"In spite of the traffic on the parkways and two tunnels to drive through, i used to enjoy flying out of Pittsburgh airport.  I even remember the old airport, before this one!  Now over time, flying has become a chore and unpleasant.  Some airports make things easier, others do not.  Pittsburgh airport tries, but there is something lacking.  After recently seeing the airport in Minneapolis, the need for Pittsburgh to modernize and upgrade is clear.  This airport doesn't meet the needs of the future for business or personal travelers.  Plus, it needs a airline to commit to providing a dependable service. It is not the airports fault that the airlines jam passengers to capacity in smaller seats and minimum leg room.    Recently, the authorities made the announcement that the people will be able to accompany their family and friends to their departure gate.  I hate to have to stand in that security line while trying to catch my flight on-time.    I know to prepare for the inevitable lines to check luggage and get through security.  I know to bring my patience and that it will be tested.  Some days go better than others.   Unfortunately, I don't see better days for this airport."}
{"text":"This place could definitely use a facelift! There is a stale air in this airport and the decor is outdated. There are no designated charging stations and outlets are extremely hard to come by.  I was here for a few hours waiting for my connecting flight. The terminal i was in was a ghost town. Not only were there not many people traveling but there were no workers to be found in 2 of the 4 options I had to choose from for a bite to eat.   I was a little concerned with the lack of security at this airport. There was an entire family sitting with their 20-something daughter/sister at the gate waiting for her to board. Last I checked anyone not flying was not allowed beyond security."}
{"text":"Great signage in a very antique airport. Surprisingly easy to get around considering that it looks like they haven't remodeled the place since the 70's.  They have some great art installments around the terminals and a lot of what I think could be displays from part of Pittsburgh's history. You have to double back from the baggage carousel area quite a bit if you want to get to the car rental desks, airport hotel, shuttles, or exit.   They actually handle international flights here as well, which is interesting cause the carousels look like they are on their last legs. Everything about the airport is antique. They have a \"new\" TSA Security checkpoint on departures that you should take cause there are NO lines - but getting there is epic and you travel through construction trailers to get there."}
{"text":"The airport is nice and clean with many shops and restaurants.  The airport rep at Delta was friendly and didn't mind answering questions.  It was an easy walk from the rental to the gate.  The only issue and it could have been that day, the TSA Pre-Check only had one line.  I was okay, but the other one was closed and there was a really long line in the regular line.  The TSA agents were polite and did their job.  The airport is easy to navigate.  The most important tip is that you can arrive 1.5 hours and still have plenty of time.  I went during a conference that took over the city and we still had plenty of time to get to our gate."}
{"text":"Super friendly and helpful staff everywhere we went. Our flight was delayed but the staff were amazing in informing us. It was late and crowded but still clean and efficient. The restrooms were clean and stocked."}
{"text":"Never had any major issues at this airport. There are 3 different parking options: short term, long term and extended. The short term is $1.00 for the 1st hour and $4.00 thereafter. It's great because it's connected to the airport. The other parking options require you to hop on a shuttle. So it takes time to park, wait at the shuttle stop and ride the shuttle. The shuttle is great, but makes stops so it can take up some time. There's an alternate security check in during rush hours (6-8am & 4-6pm). It's upstairs and you have to go slightly outside the terminal. (There are signs, follow them) Otherwise, the main security check-in in smack dap in the middle of the airport. Haven't had a single problem with security. You do have to take a TRAM from security to the actual gate but it's super fast. The food court is clean and there are great options. I love that there are great shopping options at this airport too! Traveling with kids? There's a kids play area near the food court."}
{"text":"I came to update my review upon the news that PIT just got a Starbucks to discover it never posted in the first place. I love love loved that if you wanted coffee, the overrated mermaid wasn't an option! Whatever, PIT is still cool.  Like many others, I'm a proponent of the Alternate Security Checkpoint. It saves time and makes you feel like you're in on something.  The art is my favorite. George Washington, Franco Harris, an actual dinosaur, the bridge Transformer, a little Warhol...there's something to see in every direction. The shopping is better than most, and check-in is easy. What more do you need? Oh yeah, free wi-fi."}
{"text":"My daughter left for basic training today. There was a very friendly lady at the information desk. She was an older blonde. She was so nice so accommodating & so understanding. She guided us to the areas where we needed to meet our daughter & she even went out of her way to see if all of us airmen & airwomen & their families could just go through the first class lane for security. Then she guided us toward where her plane was. I am as well as others were so happy to have such an awesome lady guide us in our time of need. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Easy airport to navigate around.  They have a train that takes you from the Check in/Baggage area to the actual terminal where the planes take off.  The airport was very clean and had this place that supposedly made the most amazing bloody Mary's (its in the US Air terminal) and they were right cause the spicy bloody Mary I had before my flight was awesome!  Not bad for a airport price either only $12 and it was pretty big."}
{"text":"PIT - I just don't understand why I have to walk a mile from the entry of the breezeway (entering from extended parking) all the way down to the terminal, then up stairs or take an elevator to drop my bags off & then make my way back down with my massive carry ons, to then wait in line to be full body scanned by security and then redress like a one night stand & sprint up 2 sets of escalators to then take a tram to the actual gates... It's a process!  You definitely made me miss CLE.  Extended parking wasn't that bad (smart tip: take a photo of your parking section before you head to the terminal) it only cost me $44 bucks to park Sunday through Friday. And when I returned - my car was safe and undoor-dinged! Schwing!  The actual gate area wasn't bad (I think I was in C) but I passed through the terminal in a rush - I think I saw a Mickey D's and a TGIF Friday's - what else could you need?  I don't know that I'll make the 2.5 hour trip from CLE to PIT again, unless of course they offer the only direct flight to Memphis I can find... blah, work training!"}
{"text":"who the hell told everyone else about the top secret security line?  lately, it's been worse than the regular security line.    BOO!  the best spot to get a quick sandwich here is at Charley's.  really good breakfast sandwiches and love the turkey club too.    why do i always get so annoyed at the steelers guy near the escalators?  oh it's because i'm anti steelers.  i just can't jump on that train.  sorry!"}
{"text":"Actually this is a pretty good airport. The only big negative is the lack of plugs and charging stations. The layout is good, plenty of food choices. Most close to each other.  Directions in the middle are great, past that, mediocre.  Good wifi, not great.  Spacious, comfortable, well lite."}
{"text":"I've only flown here once and have yet to leave so god know what kind of horrible travel nightmares still await me.  However, I had a wonderful flight coming into PIT and the old man at the info booth was sooooo sweet!!  He was like blah blah blah...let me tell you about my 5 grandchildren...blah blah blahhhh....so nice.  He gave me a plethora of maps, coupons, information, and cute little stories about random things.  The 28X bus took me straight to CMU, no lost luggage, no delays!"}
{"text":"I love this airport. I come here sometimes for work and everything is really clear - easy to navigate. That means a lot coming from me, since I use Google Maps to go somewhere about ten times before fully memorizing the directions LOL."}
{"text":"This is my hometown airport.  Recently they opened the restaurants & shops for one day to people who were not traveling. You still had to pass through security. They should offer this more often. They use a separate security line so it does not impact travelers. We tried the new martini bar which was great. Our favorite shop by far was Bottega Dei Sapori. They were friendly, attentive, offered samples.   It would have been nice if the airport and shops decorated for the holidays. There was only one decorated tree. The live band playing was loud and awful. Next time, turn down the volume and try holiday music or instrumental music. Use recorded music if you can't get good talent.  It's also nice to see there is finally food/beverage options on the land side especially the Starbucks by baggage claim. It's a shame these places aren't open later in the evening. I've not been able to try any of them."}
{"text":"Gotta love an airport with a mall inside !"}
{"text":"I love airports and air traveling, but not this airport. While the services (food and shopping) have increased and security is usually quick, compared to other airports, this is not the greatest airport. Also, this airport is not large, therefore it makes running to your next gate fairly simple. Personally, the most annoying thing about the Pittsburgh Airport is that it's difficult to get a direct flight anywhere. In some regards, it's almost ridiculous. Most places, you have to fly through Chicago or Philadelphia."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Pittsburgh airport. Growing up in Atlanta and dealing with the craziness of that airport, this airport has been such a nice change of pace. It's much smaller airport, security lines are always less crowded, and there's only a single terminal where all of the gates are located. Although I wish there were more international flights out of Pittsburgh, I don't mind having to travel to Atlanta or New York to head overseas."}
{"text":"Spent a lot of time here recently thanks to some high winds in Boston...it's a perfectly decent small airport with excellent features such as a dinosaur skeleton and a Mr. Rogers exhibit!!!  Bonus!  I think it has a Benjamin Franklin statue as well...  Anyway, a perfectly pleasing experience in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I have flown through almost every airport in the US and this one is my fav.  Am I biased because it is based in my \"hometown\"?  Yes, probably.  But let me spell out the reasons why I like it.  1) The centralized X design of the terminal makes it very easy to get from any get to any other gate.  There's no need to get on a bus or to run up and down escalators/stairs.  2) Nice selection of shops and restaurants.  If you are waiting on a flight there are places to eat and shop.  3) Rental car locations are directly connected to the airport.  There's no need to wait for a bus and then take a 20-minute ride, you can walk right out and get into your car.  4) There is a Hilton connected directly to the airport.  Who hasn't been stuck overnight at the airport and forced to scramble to locate a hotel that is close enough that it makes sense."}
{"text":"There isn't really much that makes this airport stand out much. It's easy enough to get around in, there are actually some decent dining spots (Bar Symon is my recommendation), and they seem to have their act together for the most part. Why 4-stars? Because they've got a Mr. Rogers Museum type thing! I know...I'm a sentimentalist. Won't you be my neighbor?"}
{"text":"It looks a little old but if you've ever seen Denver airport this place looks upscale lol. Decent shops..decent food...I enjoy coming here because it means I get the hell out of Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this airport. This was my first visit here but I didn't experience any issues. Everything was easy to find, there's plenty of shopping and restaurants and it's super clean. They could use a few updates just to make it a bit more modern. But overall, nice job!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to be, I'm actually pretty impressed by this airport! There's nothing before security, but once you're through security there are a ton of restaurants, places to hang out and shops. If you're just picking someone up at this place it's pretty lame, but if you're taking a flight, try to check through as quickly as possible to get to the good stuff.  PIT has a good layout. Once you're in and through the little train station, every gate is easy walking distance and in a logical place - none of those weird twisty hallways and obscure long walks. There's a post office (which is a rarity in international airports!), an extensive pharmacy, and a vast selection of fast food and sit down places, from pubs to chain restaurants.   The airport is dotted with interesting historical information with some great displays, including a dinosaur skeleton, so if you're looking to pass the time there's a bit there to do."}
{"text":"I love this airport. I never have an issue here whether it's with flights, luggage, rental cars, security, etc.. The people who work here seem pretty agreeable. There are a lot of shops and places to eat. Plus, like others have said, you can't beat the figure of Franco Harris making the Immaculate Reception. It makes me smile every time I see it. :)"}
{"text":"Great smaller airport. We were able to get through TSA fairly quickly without hassle. I liked that they had lots of Pittsburgh memorabilia and localness so that when you landed you know where you were. The shops for food and shopping were acceptable. This was one of my more convenient airport experiences."}
{"text":"Big airport with small airport efficiency.  Hotel connected to the airport by a moving walkway for those super early flights.  One stop train to all gates.  Nice centralized shops, easy to navigate.  US Airways club on the 2nd level.  Pretty nice place."}
{"text":"Very clean airport! A great change from Cleveland International. Love getting great deals on flights. Flew Jetblue and had a good experience."}
{"text":"Nice clean simple airport."}
{"text":"Shops galore, free wifi and sweet Southwest customer service peeps who got me on an earlier flight for no fee. If only all airports could be so accommodating. Only gripe: no Starbucks. I know, I know, but I have free drink coupons I wanted to use."}
{"text":"We flew out of here recently and I was pleasantly surprised. The wait time to check in with Southwest wasn't long and we made it through the TSA checkpoints fairly quickly. The process was as expected (empty everything into a bin and remove your shoes), but the TSA officers were practically friendly. There is a shuttle that takes you to the main terminal. I've never seen it so crowded that there's a wait to get on. Short term parking is very reasonable at $1 when you're picking up your family or friends.   If you're in Pittsburgh and somehow have the illusion that you actually have a choice of airports, then pick this one."}
{"text":"It ain't the MIA that's for sure. Weird layout but hey just get me home! The lines were short and people were nice."}
{"text":"Not a bad airport, in fact it's quite manageable in its size and gate layout. The only MAJOR problem is NOISE POLLUTION.\" I was utilizing their wonderful massage franchise and had to put in earplugs to block out two bizarrely competing music sources and tons of announcements. Do you guys pay any attention to how stressful noise is on humans?! Please."}
{"text":"Pit. Get your act together. For the love of all that is good, get toilet paper that doesn't break off one square at a time. Your cleaning crew will love you for it. And my blood pressure will go down.  And once you have that part down, please replace the toilets that like to randomly flush, spraying you with your own pee water. But, I'll take the toilet paper fix first."}
{"text":"In my travels throughout these United States, I've been to many places and run a few marathons here and there. It was my first time to fly into Pittsburgh and it was pretty cool.  Like many airports across this great country, Pittsburgh is a regional airport (PIT). In Pennsylvania, the largest airport in the state would arguably be in Philadelphia and not Pittsburgh. Someone can correct me if I am wrong. Flying in and out of Pittsburgh was the most logistical and economical choice for me, deciding against flying into major hubs on the east coast - IAD, BWI, and DCA to name a few. I arrived here on a Friday afternoon and thought that getting off the plane and into the rental car took at most 20 minutes. This airport is considered smaller than most major airports, considering how much less airport there is in Pittsburgh than those of in Los Angeles, Chicago, or any airport of New York City. Considering that I can get off the plane and into the rental car - without waiting for the rental car shuttle - in less time, is virtually priceless. I'm happy that the car rental counters are inside the baggage claim terminal and the car rental garage was adjacent to the terminal too. The overall experience here was great. In and out in 20 minutes is a great thing, if you are on a tight schedule.  Pittsburgh international airport is located southwest of the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Like all airports, large or small, they have parking lots, paid and cell phone lots. A few major carriers fly into Pittsburgh, one of which, Delta airlines, I flew here to Pittsburgh. I'm glad that interstate 376 connects with the airport, so I can be able to find my way out of Pittsburgh and be on my way. Pittsburgh international airport serves millions of people each year, myself is now included in the mix. The airport terminal is easy to navigate and there's plenty of restrooms. The terminal is 100% clean and optimum for the everyday traveler. There are some good shops and a definitely a pretty good food court for those who want to eat before a flight.  Being able to be here is always nice and just being in eastern time zone again. I was recommended to eat at Curittos while at the airport, so I intend on doing that! It's advisable that you would fly into Pittsburgh to easier access western Pennsylvania and parts of West Virginia and western Maryland. If flying into Philadelphia, you'll will have a longer drive time. Best bet would for the $$. You may get a better deal if you fly here versus the other airports on the eastern seaboard. The downside would be the driving that may be more or less to where you need to go. 4 stars here, since you can get in and out of the airport in your rental car in 20 minutes or less.  Definitely recommended, if your travels come through Pennsylvania and the surrounding communities / states.  Support local!  B"}
{"text":"I love this airport because its clean, easy to navigate, and most importantly, the lines at security checkpoints are usually minimal. I can usually make it through within 15 mins or so. Downside is many flights from here require you to connect elsewhere as there do not seem to be many long distance nonstop flights from this airport."}
{"text":"This airport has so many cool factors. There is only one terminal for all the airlines, which makes things very easy. Signage is excellent throughout. Plenty of restrooms. Staff are pleasant. tourist info offices both airside and landside. Once airside, there is plenty of shopping / eating choices. I just hung out at the Godiva store and had that decadent frozen smoothie thingy!! There are really some cool shops to walk about. I really loved this airport. Wish I live in PIT!"}
{"text":"I like this airport; I thought it was laid out well and wasn't confusing at all. The security people were actually pretty nice but the lines were crazy. I actually went to the secondary line, as the other one was long (according to airport personnel positioned by the door), but the secondary line was pretty freaking long too. Plus you go out the door, and across the drive, and then in an old seemingly unused part of the airport...I kinda wondered if I was in the wrong place...but I wasn't and eventually got through.  It really is easy to get around and it doesn't seem as huge as a few of the other airports I have been in. They have a few cool shops and of course everything is Steelers! They even have Pittsburgh chocolate at the bookstore. Oh! And they have a real bookstore in there...that's where I wasted my time waiting on my flight...it was awesome!  One thing they had which I thought was cool was the water fountains that had a tall spigot for water bottles.   I liked this airport, but I also don't hate airports and don't travel much so maybe I don't know what I am talking about...lol But it's not a bad place, and any place that has a bookstore makes me happy!"}
{"text":"Having flown through 20 different US airports so far in my life I feel pretty comfortable rating PGH INTL four stars.  It isn't the most modern facility nor the prettiest but it is a reliable and well-built airport.  Last time I checked it was the best de-icing airport in the Northeast (a must in the winter) and rarely does it get shut down due to weather.  Allegheny County isn't very \"exciting\" when it comes to extreme weather (*Knock On Wood*).  Parking coming in and out is clearly marked and accessible.  Each of the airlines that flies through PGH has well lit stations for check-in.  The only sticking point would be that this is one airport where you HAVE to err on the side of caution when it comes to the time you allot to get across security.  I've made lines that I thought would take hours but flew right on through.  I've stepped up to shorter lines that took just a long as the longer lines.  Once you're past the hassle part of traveling, checking baggage and making it into the councourses the airport as a lot to offer.  There are several outlet stores, a TGI Fridays, a Rite Aid, McDonalds, and a bunch of other eateries.  The Councourses also have free WiFI, albeit it depending on how far from the router you end up it can be pretty darn slow.  The only qualm I have would be lighting.  I think the place feels \"grungier\" than it really is because lighting isn't as good as it should be.  I hope as airlines consolidate that they consider PGH for more direct flights and even HUB Status."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better airports in this country.. they have free wifi, great food places and, most of the time, have very small security lines. Plus they have huge dinosaur statues!!"}
{"text":"Yet again this biweekly traveler has encountered a TSA precheck line longer than the regular line. A frustrating but common occurrence in pgh. Is someone scheduled on break? There seem to be staff milking around - but not opening the second scanner. I paid for more efficient service - right?"}
{"text":"Ah, the Pittsburgh airport. To which I honestly have to go, \"Not too bad, not too bad at all.\"  This airport kind of hits the middle ground in terms of air and foot traffic alike - it's not too little or too big, and not too quiet or too busy (for the most part). I think this is part of the reason why the security staff here are far nicer than what I've experienced at other airports. They definitely prove that you can indeed enforce security without being a jerk about it. I've also spent less time waiting in security lines here than in almost any other airport - even holiday traveling trouble has been minimal for me. I still always budget for plenty of time to get through just in case something goes wrong, because let's be honest: slow security lines can strike at any moment at any airport.  Food options here aren't really amazing but aren't absolutely horrid. There's a very small food court area that offers some standard fast food type options, as well as sit-down options courtesy of places like TGIF. You can also find a range of foods from unhealthy but delicious giant breakfast muffins to healthier Subway options in the food court area, and I'm a big fan of Nature's Kitchen. There's some shopping options as well if you need to pick up small gifts while passing through or stock your toiletry bag back up. There's nothing that really stands out to me but it's a decent lineup nonetheless. (Personal note: for the last five years or so all of my flights have left from Concourse D so there may also be other options in the other Concourses and beyond the little food court that I don't know about.)  Unfortunately, because it's Pittsburgh everything here shuts down early and very few places are open bright and early at this airport. As someone who's had to catch early flights or who has come in very late I've just learned to expect this and eat breakfast at home or stock up on anything I might need at the airport I'm in beforehand. Another negative is that this airport's location isn't really convenient, so unless you impose on a family member or friend and catch a ride out, be ready to pay a big parking bill or taxi fare in addition to everything else. Oh: I've also learned to drive to this airport before or after rush hour and I schedule my flights accordingly, even if I means I have to drive out at ridiculous hours in the night or morning. It's better than sitting in traffic worrying about missing the flight!  But, for all of my complaints about the food and location and whatnot, one thing I really do like is the airport's decorations and sense of style; honestly, nothing compares to coming home after a long trip and seeing a wall of Andy Warhol prints or the replica of a T-Rex skeleton from the local museum. It just screams \"welcome home\" - or \"welcome to Pittsburgh\" if you're an out of towner - and after a long trip I can definitely appreciate that. So keep it up, Pittsburgh airport. You're not doing too bad, not too bad at all."}
{"text":"A Kim Kardashian-type airport--meaning it is a big ass airport!  Wear comfortable shoes--try to limit what you are carrying and by all means if you have trouble walking ask for assistance.  They have several people movers here if that indicates how much walking you will do just to get on or off a plane.  Again you will end up riding a shuttle once you are on-site to get you to the gates.  The security check seemed to flow at an average pace but not much room once you go thru to get your shoes back on and personal belongings gathered."}
{"text":"This airport has never been difficult for me. I can always find where I am going with no problem or hassle. Great selection of stores, bars, and restaurants to check out while waiting for your flight. Love all the Pittsburgh history throughout the airport. Also that there is an uber/lyft section to be picked up which I haven't seen and highly encourage. My only complaint is that this airport needs some serious updating. Looks like it's stuck in the 80s/90s and would benefit from some updating for sure!"}
{"text":"Lots of ahops.  Easy access to gates via tram.  Security gets long.  Security is efficient though.  Dated and older airport - hasn't been modernized in ages."}
{"text":"Is Pittsburgh the BEST airport? No, but it's the only airport that I love flying out of and happy to come back home to. It truly is home.  There are a few TGIFridays and other restaurants like Bar Symon and the standards like McDonalds. If you have a very late flight, don't expect to find much open, if anything.   The shops here are pricey but you are paying for convenience.  I've seen the airport go through transitions over the years. It's always clean and employees are generally helpful."}
{"text":"I love this airport and compared to others, here is why:  1) it's spacious and well designed, bathrooms are everywhere and the halls are wide and have carpet so it's not too loud and easier on your feet. 2) there are plenty of places to eat and shop, it's like a small mall. 3) the layout is easy to navigate, you would have to work hard to get lost or turned around.  I've been to 16 airports this year and Pittsburgh has been my favorite."}
{"text":"The airport is small, at least in comparison with most international airports. This largely a blessing. I prefer to fly JetBlue from here, as I have found their service to be quick and courteous. The dining options within the airport are surprisingly varied, although as to be expected, not exactly a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Very good airport. Lots of space and has large shop and dine area while waiting for flight. Reminds me of the setup at Denver Airport. The food court area ranges from fast food type places to sit down dine in restaurants like TGI Fridays. There are various shops for everyone.From Hugo Boss to Rite Aide.They also have a Pandora Jewelry store, Sunglass Hut, and a Brooks Brothers along with countless souvenir shops and kids shops as well as sports memorabilia stores (Steelers, Penguins, Pirates)."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place would be so huge! Be prepared to tram it over to claim your luggage, and for somewhat dated facilities. They're incredibly efficient, though and while the size is a bit intimidating my experiences were both seamless.  A note on nearly everything about Pittsburgh: It's bigger than you think. I had no idea this city was such a big, bustling place. So it makes sense that their airport is a biggun. I was totally impressed how easy it is to move through it given its size -- I had my luggage in under 15 minutes and when I came back to check into my flight, the lines moved swiftly and sans-stress.   While the tramming was a bit of a surprise (and what I would get stressed about if I had a connecting flight here), it was actually really easy to maneuver and I believe takes you from where the planes are to where everything else is. There are also tons of shopping options in the terminal and higher-end brands at that. A great way to waste time if you've got it to waste. Not to shabby, Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Clean and modern airport. Centralized hub with lots of restaurant and shop choices. Bathroom is extremely clean and spacious. If you have kids and have spare time to kill, I highly recommend terminal B's painting project. $10-$20 and you can paint your own art on objects or T-shirts."}
{"text":"This airport is small compared to my normal SFO. There is a lot of shops inside to keep you busy while waiting for a flight,  Brookstone, a sock shop, Nine West and more. The food choice were also plenty and central to all the gates. TGI Fridays, Mc Donalds, Quiznos ect.   The overall airport was clean well kept with all your basic needs."}
{"text":"This is a really nice airport. You can get around it fairly easy. Lots of nice shops and restaurants if you're stuck there and a full service Rite Aid too! There's a big statue of Franco Harris and the \"immaculate reception\" which is great if you're a Steelers fan."}
{"text":"I make the drive from Akron Ohio for this airport just because there is a GNC inside the facility. To anyone that takes care of their bodies, is into fitness, is attempting to maintain a healthy state, works out or just needs protein... gnc in the airport has what you need. Buy 3 quest bars get 1 free makes for the perfect meal replacement throughout my travels."}
{"text":"Wow! It only just came to me to review this airport! The best airport in America? I must be slipping in my age.   I am from Pittsburgh and my family still resides here, so this is an airport I visit often.  First off, most airports in the USA are rubbish! Most of them have no shops or cafes which are necessary if you want to kill time! But the Pittsburgh International airport is really just a shopping mall. I think the intentions when this airport was built, was just that... a shopping mall. But now you have to have a ticket to get into the aiport after September 11th, the shops are now for travellers only. But what a good way to kill time!   There's nothing worse than having a delay with nothing to do. But here, you'll be spoilt by choice on window shopping.  My only real gripe about this airport... would it kill them to again make direct flight to London so travelling home isn't such a grueling process?"}
{"text":"Lot of escalators to take to get to your flight.  Also the train only goes one stop.  I guess they are building for the future because when you fly out of Pittsburg you can save 66% over rates out of Cleveland (which is where I live).  Yup, I made the two hour drive.  Could fly me & my kids for the price of just me out of Cleveland.  Long term parking was kinda weird at the airport.  I parked right in front of the bus so that it would pick up me & my family, but it drove off, so we had to walk to a bus stop where they did pick us up.  But for another family, they picked them up at their car.  Weird."}
{"text":"I've traveled a lot for work and leisure. This airport is definitely the largest with fewest amount of people and obstacles to navigate.  Everything is easy to use with little or no waiting (Security, bag check inside or out, monorail to terminals, retail); it's very modern with a lot of stores for food, drinks, shopping; everyone is super friendly (I do mean everyone here and in the Pitt); it's modern with cool exhibits about how the city has evolved over time; State Troopers are also present.  I love this airport and city!"}
{"text":"Very nice and easy airport to travel through.   The best things about this airport are the following:   --Renting a car is a breeze. The rental counters are inside the airport and you walk across the street to pick up your car. You drive straight out and no one checks your papers in the way out.  --When you return the car, there's a gas station with reasonable prices right at the airport with plenty of signage directing you to this gas station.  --the airport is well laid out with the concourses in a hub pattern. There are no long walks here to the gates.   It's usually not crowded. The concessions are decent. The only problem is it's not a major hub so you may need to transfer to get to or from this airport."}
{"text":"I've been to this airport more times than I can count and while I love \"the Burgh\" the place needs a face-lift and update.  The positives are if you are stuck there for awhile the shopping and food options are good.  The TSA there is usually pretty friendly....that is about it.  The negatives- First of all it is kind of out of the way to get to...you drive and drive and just when you think you have missed it, you finally see the turn-off.  It just looks run-down inside. Worn carpet, very few outlets, and kind of barren in places it reminds me of a jewel that has lost its shine.    The lines on Monday mornings are off the hook.  I cannot think of another airport that is so slow about getting people through TSA.  If you have an early morning flight lie (7-7:30) and the line is through the sliding doors you better be in that line at 5:30 AM or you will not make it.  By the time you get through the line, on the tram, and then down the LONG hallways you will be lucky if you make it.  If you land after 9pm you feel like you have landed on a dessert island.  The stores and restaurants are all closed so if you have flown across country forget eating here.  Fortunately there are restaurants open a few exits down.  I love Pittsburgh (it is close to home) I just hope they give the place some love and get some more flights in there to make it what it could be!"}
{"text":"I like this small town feel but very convenient airport like the Pittsburgh international airport. They have enough room for layover to enable us to shop around and hang around while going to different gates"}
{"text":"American / US Airways sucks when it comes to getting a luggage take another airline hope they can get it there in 10 minutes from US Airways takes half hour"}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry and using extended parking don't waste trying to park near the walkway to the terminal. That parking is always full.  Go straight to the furthest reaches of the parking lot where you can actually find a space and take the shuttle  Use the alternate security checkin on 3 to save time  Pittsburgh is a great place for a lay over as its like a giant mall and retailers aren't allowed to charge a premium at the airport stores  Baggage claim used to be slow but seems to have improved quite a bit"}
{"text":"What a great airport. The indoor mall they have is extremely high end. It's unfortunate that the public doesn't have access to these great stores. The layout is also great. Once through the somewhat unfortunately very long security lines a tram takes you to gates A-D which all branch off from the tram. There is a food court also centrally located. Also, they have moving walkways to take you from one end of the gate to the other.  One of my favorite parts about the airport is all of the Pittsburgh memorabilia that looks like it came from museums. From the giant T-Rex skeleton to the Franco Harris \"immaculate reception\" statute, it's very neat. Also, the charging pods they have are everywhere and always available and the free WiFi works decently well.  Overall I rate this as one of the top mid-size to large airports in the US. It's clean, user friendly, and culturally in touch."}
{"text":"Clean and efficient, two key characteristics of any good airport. Several shopping options for local products, like the macaron stand, and Commonwealth Press, in addition to a gourmet food market reflecting options at the Strio  District (dried pastas, etc)   TSA Pre Check is fast, better than my former choice - the alternative security checkpoint. Food options have increased over the years I've been using this airport (2004). I mostly fly Southwest, which is what keeps me flying into PIT instead of CRW which would be a lot closer to my usual destination on the east coast.   Employees are reasonably friendly, and I appreciate that a bottle of water at GNC  or Rite Aid costs as much in the airport as it would at one of these locations anywhere else in the area."}
{"text":"This airport was not the latest and greatest but it also was not as old-looking when compared with other airports. The pick up/drop off area was small and the police were telling people to drive around instead of park. This was nothing new to me since all of the airports I've been to has done something similar.  The security was straight-forward like other airports and I didn't wait long to get through to my gate.  The airport  had a tram to the terminals and it was a short ride like a few hundred feet.  I didn't need to buy any food but there were a bunch of places to eat in a mini food court.  The airport was pretty clean and I forgot to take pictures of the interior as well as some of those statues."}
{"text":"TSA was surprisingly quicker here than other mainland airports I've been to. Honestly I was pleasantly surprised how nice this airport was. They had a handful of shops and places to eat. When you walk around it feels more like a mall than an airport."}
{"text":"I had a great arrival, signs brought me where I needed to go.  Departure was a nightmare!  First, my ID had a problem, the lady TSA officer would not even look at me when I requested to know what my problem was but called a supervisor over (supervisor had an explanation of my Id glowed)  been on a whole heck of a lot of trips with that ID and it has never posed an issue!) but at least the second lady was much nicer.  Went through the body screen- no problem there. Next wE had an issue with a lava rock in my carry on.  This lava rock had been brought over without issue from Hawaii but now there was one with me.  So the gentleman was nice at first explaining it was the rock and they had to see it.  He pulled it out and swabbed it then saying to everyone in ear shot it was a hit.  Now I fell between the belt and extra screening area with no assistance from the 10 staff members standing around.  I was also told they had to then search everything.  Three people rummaged through my stuff while another performed an outright rub down!  My vagina was touched twice and breasts etc.  I was mortified, in tears and embarrassed.  Then they all just walked off!  No one said your all set, I'm sorry, go ahead.  Finally a nice gentleman whom seemed to be a sheriff or officer of some sort offered assistance to call an ambulance but I was so mortified I thanked him and told him I just wanted to get out of there.  Too far TSA too far.  Patting people's private parts even after they go through the scan is not right.  I felt violated and mistreated.  Perhaps this group needs more training but until they get it, I will not be returning to Pittsburgh Airport.  I've been home a few hours now and still crying- worst feeling ever!   I do not believe any one should be able to pat my private areas down, especially my vagina and breast."}
{"text":"The pittsburgh airport is one of the best I have been to. It's easy. Big enough to get you anywhere and small enough that you don't feel overwhelmed. Great pick up and drop out locations."}
{"text":"Best feature: a practically on site gas station, allowing you to fill up your rental car right before you return it. Love it.  Second best feature: a little window display of Mr Rogers.  Worst feature: no damned good coffee in the entire stinkin' place.   Second worst feature: It's kinda run down. Even Buffalo's airport is way nicer."}
{"text":"Easy to navigate very well laid out, small for a medium sized city. Not too many options for food but above par for most.  There are plenty of stations to charge electronic devices.  The airport is well maintained and very clean. There are alternate security check points if you're willing to walk a bit more but less wait. The staff in general are very helpful and the security is hassle free."}
{"text":"Each time I come here it improves. Flowers in the restroom! Nice touch. Outlets at Southwest gates. Refillable water fountain (verticals) and healthy choices for food."}
{"text":"I fly in and out of this airport 2 to 3 times a month.  First off...how do you not have a starbucks?  There are 2 security checkpoints...one major one and the other is usually way faster but not everyone knows about it.  This airport is either super hectic or empty...there is no inbetween.    After security, you have to get on the tram to the gates.  One stop then it guides you to A, B, C and D gates.  They are redoing their shopping and food area which is in the middle of the square.  They have added some great designer stores like Tumi and have a noodle place to eat amongst the Auntie Anne Pretzel place.  Of course there is a McDonalds and they even have a Post Office?  The rental cars are on property though and you dont have to get on a shuttle for those as all the counters are in the airport.  Over the last 7 years, they've done some work to make this airport better and Im seeing it.  It used to seem confusing to me but it's pretty straight forward and easy to maneuver if you know which door you are going to be close to so you can have your ride pick you up."}
{"text":"Now THIS is an airport!  Tons to see and tons to do while waiting for your flight to take off.  I'm not a person who buys things in airports but I do like to be entertained.  This airport has everything -- CVS, Gap, NineWest, a massage bar!  There's tons to do...and before you know it, you're flight is boarding.  Also, this place s incredibly easy to get in and out of and organized for good traffic flow, both inside and out.  At only two hours away, it's a nice alternative to flying out of Hopkins when airlines feel like charging and arm and a leg for flights."}
{"text":"Decent airport. New from many years back. Has TSA Pre, but no Clear. Rental cars right across the street (no shuttle just walk there). Starbucks in airport outside of having to go through security. I am pretty sure everytime I have gone through this airport I had to take the train. to and from the main terminal. But it is still an easy to get through place with lots of nice shops (no tax on clothes or shoes in PA!)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite airports. There's no rental car shuttle. Just drop the car off and walk across the street. Several eating choices and it's very clean. The Philly airport is a third world country still trying to build a well."}
{"text":"This airport is one of the easiest to navigate.  The signage is great.  It is very clean.  There is two options for going through security which makes the wait less lengthy. The \"air mall\" used to have a wider selection of stores but they have been dwindling.  The only complaint I have about this airport is the amount of time it takes to get your luggage."}
{"text":"It's an airport, so it's not like you're going to be wowed by the people, the service, the food or the sights.  This place has two things that make it stand out, though.  The first is the impressive line at the security gate.  The second I won't talk about because it's a secret that helps with bypassing that long line.  And no, it doesn't involve a wheelchair."}
{"text":"I travel a bit and the layout of this airport for the size of Pittsburgh is way bigger than needed but it has shops and restaurants that is more mall like than airport like.  Security lines flow okay -   The Car Rental is in the garage attached to the airport terminal...way better than shuttles.  It is quite a haul to downtown Pittsburgh 20-30 minutes but traffic is known to shut down around the bridges and tunnels so give yourself plenty of time.  ALSO THE BEST - WIFI is FREE...none of that charge crap you get almost everywhere else..."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Pittsburgh International. It's a relatively large airport with 4 terminals and about 100 gates. Although it's not on the list of largest or busiest airports in America, I feel like that's a good thing. The airport itself is pretty nice inside and well kept.   There is a quality selection of dining and shopping within the terminal. There are over 100 shops with stores like Swarovski, Brighton Collectibles, Brooks Brothers, Body Shop, Godiva, Lids, Ben & Jerry's, PGA Tour Shop, GNC, Brookstone, and Rite Aid. There is also a Carnegie Science Center inside.   I saw a few restaurants as well; TGI Friday's, Charlie's Steakhouse, plus your normal chains like McDonald's, Auntie Anne's, Mayorga Coffee and Subway. I was very surprised to find that there is no Starbucks in the airport terminals! What!  The airport flies Southwest, US Airways, Delta, Jet Blue, American Airlines and United. I have always gotten through security quickly and easily. I'm always amazed at how this airport is not overly busy. Way to go PITT!  14*34"}
{"text":"This airport is not the best (it is on the smaller side, not a lot of flight options as it is not a big hub), however, the TSA is awesome here. Every time I travel from Pitt, I keep thinking why can't other airports use the TSA staff from Pittsburgh or their training methods. It is never more than 15-20 minutes (20 minutes during rush hour if you use the alternate security check point) to check in. Plus the parking is $8 a day (WOW, in Boston it was $35, which is where I moved from).   Iron Chef Symon just opened a new restaurant Bar Symon, though I have not tried it as yet. A couple of decent food options here from McDonalds and Quiznos to Curritos and Sbarro. Healthy and vegan options are available here so that is a plus.  Godiva had a store here, which was great for picking up chocolates to impress the wife after taking the last flight home, however they have closed the store since then. Swatch, Nine West and Swarovski have stores here too as more expensive alternatives to the shut Godiva store, but helpful nonetheless.   Wifi is free, the restrooms are clean and the escalators and trams are always functional (not seen any major breakdowns). I just wish more flights flew in and out from Pittsburgh International Airport and that it didn't look so dated from inside."}
{"text":"This is a clean airport with a nice staff.  There are statues of football players and dinosaurs in the airport for everyone, including the kids, to enjoy.   They have some ok restaurants but could do better. However any place we had went we received great service from the employees.  The airport is pretty easy to navigate as well."}
{"text":"OK someone please tell me how this airport qualifies as an international airport. It must be A Canadian flight but still I have never ever seen this airport crowded. The airport is easy to navigate. There are a few options for food like McDonalds, ben and jerrys, a coffee house, maybe a Chinese restaurant but that's about it. There are a few shops to stop in but otherwise the airport is nice.   You do need to take a tram between the gates and baggage claim but even that comes every few minutes.   Overall one of my favorite airports to travel to but that could be that I always hit the airport on off travel times."}
{"text":"I feel sorry for the Pittsburgh airport - I really do.  In the late 1980's, US Air extorted Pittsburgh into spending $1 billion dollars to expand Pittsburgh into their largest hub in the country.  By the mid 1990's, Pittsburgh was rocking with 500 US Air flights a day, innovative designs like their X terminal and Airmall, and tons of employees.  About 10 years later, US Air decided that the operating costs were too high (driven by the debt that US Air forced Pittsburgh to take on) and dropped hub status and moved on to force Philadelphia and Charlotte to make similar expansions.  By 2013, the Pittsburgh airport served as many passengers as they did in 1975 and only a fraction of flights.  Unfortunately, the terminal has become a poorly lit, dingy half empty airport with sparse timetables.  The actual flight experience and facilities is pretty good, but it depresses me to fly here.  Pittsburgh deserves better than the hand US Air dealt them."}
{"text":"Its an airport. It does have a lot of shopping if you're waiting.  Lines at TSA seem to long for the size. I like overall easy to get in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Easy airport to get through. Lots of great eating choices and there is even a drugstore inside so if you forgot anything you can pick it up before you reach your destination.  The airport has TSA precheck, but no Clear lines yet. All and all a great airport."}
{"text":"This is an extremely medium airport.  It's almost big, but not quite...  I've been here one million times.  Here's what I've learned:  GOOD: - Security works pretty well.  Never wait too long. - Life-sized George Washington statue?  Check! - Life-sized Franc Harris Immaculate Reception display?  Check! - Life-sized T-Rex?  Yes!  (I mean, who has that?) - It's easy to navigate, with sort of an X-shape, so none of the concourses is TOO long.  BAD: - Several of the shops/restaurants are vacant.  Where'd they go? - It's pretty drab in here folks.  Brown floor tile.  Rust-colored wallpaper."}
{"text":"Smaller airport that is easy to get in and out of. Pretty good food choices.  Only drawback is that it is insanely expensive to fly to Pittsburgh on just about every airline for some reason."}
{"text":"Its by far one of the cutest airports ive seen. Their terminal area is super cute. Aside from the giant christmas tree that's the centerpiece atm. You can feel how big and nice the terminal area is.   There's these big giant floating sculptures hung from the ceiling that gives it the indication the you are in Pittsburgh. Then there's that big giant jurassic park t-rex skeleton on display. Yes, that's awesome points for anybody right there. Who doesn't like dinosaurs?? I know I love em.  Anyways, remember to come early. This is your only responsibility when it comes to flying. The ticketing agents, TSA, gate agents and airline employees aren't there to make your life a living hell. They're there for your accountability and safety, not because they knew you were coming to fly that day. They have better things to do with their time than to single you out.  Thank you very much Pittsburgh airport for the opportunity to fly out from your airport. You are a true gem.  Remember, life is what you make of it. I happen to make mine awesome!"}
{"text":"Security lines usually move along well. There are some good places to eat (bar symon) and the standard places as well. They have been doing a lot of work to make the airport nicer. Flights run generally on time."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool airport. I am not biased because I am a native Pennsylvanian or anything( I am from eastern PA) The layout is nice and it provides really easy access to all the terminals. Train from ticketing is super fast and arrives every 90 seconds!! No sweating having to miss a flight on that account. Centralized food court is also a nice feature! Not a huge airport but very well planned out."}
{"text":"I live in St. Louis now, but I'm originally from the Pittsburgh area and I consider PIT my \"home\" airport.   When I first started flying as a high schooler, I was absolutely amazed by how mall-like the airport felt - shops, food and massage stations were everywhere. As a young lass heading to Paris with a school group for her first time, I was blown away and thought I had hit the big time.  When I flew as a college student, my excitement for the airport tamed a bit, but I still was occupied for hours before takeoff. There just was so much to do and look at, and the air staff were quite tolerant about me taking photos absolutely everywhere. (Before yet another trip to Paris, I commandered a ticket-reading-computer-thing for a photo. Yes, this was pre-9/11)  And now as an adult, I'm still flying to PIT to get my family and friend fix. I've grown a little airport weary in recent years, but I still think PIT is way better than other airports, despite the airline cutbacks that seem to be happening all around the country. There still are plenty of shops of all types, and I can find more than enough vegetarian-friendly meals (something I can's say for other airports). My heart still flutters with happiness when I take the tram from the gate to baggage, and I lovelovelove that the place is entirely \"Pittsburgh.\" Everywhere you look, you'll find part of Pittsburgh's history, lore and charm, be it in the statues, the PSAs or the black and gold everywhere. And it feels like an afterthought at this point, but my flights to and from PIT have always been on time and smooth. Airport signage is pretty straightforward, and as others have mentioned, PIT is easy to navigate.  It's true that PIT is out in IkeaTargetSuburbLand and can be a pain to reach from your downtown hotel, but taxis and a (long) bus ride are options. Parking also is ridiculously inexpensive (When my parents fetch me, they like to park in long-term parking instead of short-term, and they'll spend a couple of hours roaming the airport shops before my arrival. Somehow, that parking is cheaper.)."}
{"text":"Even though the terminals were completed in 1992, PIT is showing a little age already. I think this is partly because it was built for lots more passenger traffic than it currently sees, so with vast concourses and empty spaces everywhere, you start to notice things like the terminals' age a bit more.  It was once a major hub for USAir, although that airline never really found firm financial footing and scaled back dramatically after 2001. The expansion of airlines like Southwest, JetBlue, and even Allegiant has helped offset the decline in passenger traffic somewhat.   These days, PIT serves a variety of domestic and international airlines and generally manages to get you to many places in the eastern U.S. despite the fact that it's no longer a hub. To try to boost traffic at the airside \"air mall,\" they've even opened things up to non-passengers on weekdays. Overall, it still gets the job done - just a bit quietly."}
{"text":"I fly A LOT and this is by far one of the simplest airports I have had to deal with. I am very pleased with the staff that I have come across & the ease of going through the airport.   Great job guys. Keep it up."}
{"text":"The airport is great I use to drive to Cleveland, but since Pittsburgh is as reasonable I fly just out of Pittsburgh.  The only reason it is given 4 out of 5 is the Subway Restaurant tried to over charge me. When I thought it was taken care of the, I heard the gentleman behind me arguing about the same thing.   They had a special and we were being charged full price.  I complained by calling the owner, submitting a complaint with customer service, and finally writing to the corporate office.  No response.  I will still use the airport but not either of the subways in the airport, since it is the same owner for both."}
{"text":"I love this airport!  I went to see an art opening in November,  in which they unveiled 2 new artworks at the airport, a 69,000 square-foot terrazzo floor entitled \"The Sky Beneath Our Feet\" by Clayton Merrell, and Toby Fraley's \"Robot Repair Shop.\"  I don't know another airport quite like this one...it's not overly commercial.  There are Fred Rogers exhibits, and a beautiful art piece by Calder.    One thing I really like is that businesses have to charge street prices for everything they sell.  That saves the consumer from being gouged.  I don't wait in long lines like I do in other airports.  My luggage arrives very quickly.  I also like the free shuttle service from the parking lots.  The drivers are always very professional, plus they are not asking for tips."}
{"text":"I travel often so I've been through several airports. Pittsburgh is one of the easiest ones for me to get through. Maybe it's because I know it so well but I do think it's a more pleasant experience than others. All of the employees I have encountered here have been pleasant. The restrooms are always clean no matter what part of the airport I am in. I also noticed a sign that they now have a nursing lounge for mothers. So cool! I love when an establishment thinks of the needs of different people. When the security lines are extremely long we are still able to get through them in a decent amount of time. They also have an additional security area to help with that issue. There's a nice variety of places for any needs such as ibprofin, food, water, magazines and so on. The assortment of various food spots is nice. I always love seeing the dinosaur in there welcoming you back. Safe travels! Hope your experiences here are equally as good."}
{"text":"Previously my home airport, but i've seen it alot this year. While there's only 1 TSA portal that leads to terminal train, it never takes long to get through the checkpoint. The people are friendly and efficient. The airport is neatly divided into 4 terminals in a cross-formation and they have made new, clean updates to the food and shopping vendors in the central terminal space. i love the tidbits of pittsburgh and airport history that hang everywhere, giving travellers and insight to the heart of the airport. It's a shame that non-flyers cannot utilize the shopping as it was designed because the selection of stores is quite good. For service, rarely do flights stay long on the tarmac and landing and taking off is mostly pain-free. The airport is clean and not desperately crowded."}
{"text":"Not the biggest airport and isn't a home to any major airline. But it does suffice as a domestic airport terminal.   There is a pnc ATM next to rite aid. Most of the shops are closed at night so if your flight arrives at night, there's no restaurants opened.  It's a rather small airport and it won't take you more than 10 minutes to get to any gate from the TSA checkpoint. I usually go to the secondary TSA checkpoint on the second floor, same floor as the airline Checkin counters. It usually has a shorter queue.   After the TSA check, everyone had to take the sky shuttle to the airline terminal."}
{"text":"After visiting a ton of airports, I have to say we have a pretty darn good one here in the Burgh. Easy to navigate, never a super long line at TSA and the line always is efficient and quick, lots of good food options... it's just a great airport. The layout makes sense, it's not confusing at all. Clean facility, lots of art work, friendly staff.. A + Airport in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Remarkable cheap & decent airport food. (Normally happy to pick one of those.) Going downtown? 28X bus is $2.75 and pretty direct. It's a bus - not trying to set hopes too high, but ... back home BART is $6 just to go thru the turnstile at SFO, plus distance."}
{"text":"There are 3 levels to this airport. The 1st level is where you claim your baggage and pick up your rental cars. The 2nd level is where you'll find the security check and the tram. If the main security check is long, there is an alternative line... but you have to walk outside and circle back (not sure that it's worth it because it was a pretty long walk). The 3rd level is actually where you check your bags and print your boarding pass. Kinda wonky if you ask me. Once you get through security to catch the tram to your gates, there are a whole bunch of stores to shop at (they are too rich for my blood) and a hand full of restaurants to eat at. It's not the worst airport I've traveled to/through but not the best either."}
{"text":"One of my favorite airports. Get there early because security lines can get really long, really quickly. TSA does do a great job getting passengers through the lines. Either through the regular security line or the alternate security line.   There is a great selection of food places and shops in the air-side terminal. I usually check out a bookstore to buy a good book to read on my flight. I don't normally get to spend time here to check out the restaurants but I do hope to check them out at some point.   The airport also free WiFi and power outlets available for your mobile devices.   Take advantage of the moving walkways they will help you get from Point A to Point B quicker. If you have time take a look at the Mister Rogers exhibit! It's a nice tribute to a local \"Hero\". There are other exhibits as well, such as a T-Rex skeleton on display from one of the local museums and a section dedicated to Andy Warhol's art.   Getting to the Baggage Claim seems to take awhile from the arrival gate but if you take your time to get there your bags will be ready for pick up. There are 5 or 6 rental car companies available at competitive rates.   It's underutilized by airlines but it still has a lot of direct flights. I wish big things for this airport in the future."}
{"text":"It's a sad story, that of the Pittsburgh \"international\" airport. From farmland to bustling US Air hub to nothing more than a temporary parking spot for aircraft, this airport may be a surprise to the non-pittsburgher and a heartbreak to the native. I was so prepared to give this place 5 stars- because I remember coming here as a child when everyone flew here. It is home to the infamous sky mall- where u can shop and then fly! They have flags outside of the departures area representing the countries to which they fly. This number once seemed as infinite as the stars. Now, there are only US, canada, Mexico (?), UK (?), and France. Need to check on that. Anyway, another fascinating feature of this place is that before the tram to baggage claim, you are welcomed to Pittsburgh by none other than George Washington, a steeler, Heinz ketchup, and... A t-Rex skeleton! You read correctly! A t-Rex!  Despite all this awesomeness, I had to retract a star from my initial rating intention because I was starving and apparently after 9:00 ALL FOOD CLOSES. Except mcdonalds. I would rather not eat than eat that, so here I am in my rental car starving. No bueno, PIT. But I still love you and will always have fond memories of you in your heyday."}
{"text":"When you arrive here and see 3-6 Steelers jerseys in the first 45 seconds, and then within the next 2-3 minutes see at least one mullet, you know you're home."}
{"text":"Despite spending more time than I wanted to  - in this airport - I have to admit that Pittsburgh International Airport was up there as being of my preferred airport experiences.  With a slew of flights being canceled, overbooked, or stalled - the staff at this airport did their best to keep their cool. Everything was backed up and hectic, but all of the airport staff, even those at the US Airways counter were as calm as could be, considering the circumstances, and did their best to be as patient as possible with angry tirades against them due to lousy airlines and flight predicaments.  One of the staff working the US Airways counter even nodded his head in agreement as he talked with a gentleman who had been bumped off the same flight as me. He said that even he thought it was poor practice of the airlines to overbook flights to the extent they were doing, and he was getting tired of picking up the pieces throughout the holidays.  Also - when I learned that I would be staying two nights longer than I planned to in Pittsburgh; the free wireless internet throughout much of the airport was perfect for allowing me to reschedule appointments. And since I had no luggage, the airport store selection was ideal for stocking up on late night toiletries, makeup, and even Victoria Secret bras and underwear. Even the food selection was pretty decent here.  So while I didn't necessarily enjoy most of airport time served here due to flight issues, Pittsburgh International Airport - definitely did it's best to make it as pleasant as any airport experience is going to be."}
{"text":"Uhh.. not my favorite airport.  Terminal C looks like it was last remodeled in the 80s and signage is dodgy, at best.  Priority security line was completely mismanaged with 20+ minute waits.  If you've got early morning flights, don't expect much in the way of food... lots of overpriced pastries and fast food.  Let's not forget that PIT is waaaaaay outside of city center with no practical public transportation.  On the up side, parking is cheap compared to airports of a comparable size."}
{"text":"I don't get why everyone likes to dog on PIT.  I find nothing at fault for this airport.  Every time I have flown out of here I have had no problems.    I think what people need to realize is that this airport is 25 years old at this point and built for an era that no longer exists for this airport.  I'm not going to delve into the whole hub airport thing as it would be like beating a dead horse at this point.  But people need to realize that in order to move forward, you have to embrace the past at this place.  And with the recent announcement of the complete overhaul of the airport, this place is going to be amazing.  Not to mention that it is the 2017 Airport of the Year according to Air Transport World, the first for the United States to take the honor.  My experience here has always been a swift one.  Lines never seem to be long for security checkpoints.  I know people complain about waiting, but this is by far the fastest airport I have ever gone through.  Parking is ample and you have many different choices when it comes to that, and if you like, you can prepay before you park (via online of course).  Waiting areas have an ample amount of charging ports for your electronic devices, Wifi is some of the best when it comes to airports.  Lots of selection for different types of food and shopping.  No matter what you may have forgotten to pack, you can find somewhere within the concourses.    For the people that complain that it's dead, just wait there will be more and more flights out of this airport and then you will complain that it's too busy.  There's never a happy median there.    Anyway, I'm happy that this is the closest airport to me that offers me a chance to get away.  Over time there will be more flights and you won't have to make a connection to most places, but until then, I'll take advantage of what PIT has to offer, even if I'm not there to take a flight and just came to shop (that's right, PIT is the first in the nation since 9/11 to allow persons not flying to browse the stores and restaurants within)."}
{"text":"A depressing, empty shell of it's former self. Baggage waits, especially for US Airways, is tooooo long."}
{"text":"How true Mel      It's bad enought that I'm one of those people that is of course running late while doing the 50m yard sprint across the airport, but they have the heat cranked to 100 degrees! Well, maybe not tahat bad...hahaha.  As for the airport itself, A+.  Easy to navigate, when you're on time.  Plenty of shops and places to eat, when you're on time.  Easy to read destination boards, when you're on time...I thing I'm seeing a pattern here."}
{"text":"PIT meets my criteria for a 4 star airport for the following reasons:  1. Easy to get connections to major hub airports - ORD, DFW and IAH in particular.  2. Free wi-fi that isn't pitifully slow.  3. Great signage directing you to where you need to go.  4. On site car rental center.  5. Secret extra security checkpoint that is a breeze to get through.  Minuses:  1. Sub-standard airport lounge where you have to pay for your drinks.  2. Lack of non-chain food options.  P.S. Yes, the airport is showing it's age, but all things considered, I've been in much worse airports. They get a pass and the extra star for free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Flying out of PIT can be a mixed bag.  On the plus side, there's the airport itself. PIT still has to be one of the best airports I've flown in and out of.  The airport pioneered the \"Air Mall\" concept--local stores and national chains that don't charge you more than they would otherwise.   Hey, they've got everything from Brooks Brothers to Rite Aid.  and like a previous reviewer said, who hasn't forgotten toothpaste or contact lens solution?  On the negative side, it seems like the airlines themselves have treated PIT like an unwanted stepchild.  USAIRways used to dominate the scene here, but you could always get an American or United flight out of here too.  Now it's all pretty much contracted out flights on subsidiary airlines.  Just this past week I had to fly out to Washington, DC on business and the only non-stops I could find were on USAIRways Express.  Delta, United and American would have put me on such goofy connecting routes, it would have been faster to drive to DC."}
{"text":"Such a sad state of affairs.  This place used to be a hopping, going hun of an airport.  It a lot of great choices in/out. I remember when this place was new and vibrant and it's tremendously sad to see how slow it is now. America West eroded a lot of the value of US Air and this was unfortunately collateral damage"}
{"text":"I am not much of a world traveler, I admit it. I am used to flying in and out of San Diego airport where parking is easy, shuttles are readily available, there are easy to read signs and only once place to check in.  Well surprise! On my fourth trip through this fab airport I am happy to report that IMHO it is as easy to navigate as the airport in San Diego. Parking is $1 for the first hr, so if you have to help someone bring something inside, you can do so easily. It's easy to check in, up the esclators and unlike the horrible airport in New Jersey which was dirty and ALL the staff looked and acted as thought they had been hired from Satan's personal staffing agency, everyone I interacted here was friendly and proud of their city.   This is one of those airports where you have to take a tram to your outlying terminal but even though I was lost, folks were quick to help. Lots of good places to eat, prices are reasonable and the joint is clean, clean, clean and that includes the bathrooms.   Oh yeah? Free Wi-Fi? Sweeet... :oD"}
{"text":"This is a great airport!  Lets start with FREE WIFI...what a great idea.....then add lots of CLEAN bathrooms....then add a decent food court with a good selection, and finally the abilty to walk to the rental cars just outside the terminal.  It is dated decor wise by the AA gates, and security lines can be a bit a long, as is the time from check in to taking the tram to departure.  However, I am almost always on time arriving/departing!!"}
{"text":"Easiest airport to get in and out of!  I have never had an issue with any flight or baggage etc at this airport!  The airport is easy to move around in and signs are very clear as to where you need to be!  The airport provides plenty of parking - although 74$ for 4 days is incredibly steep!  There is easy access to the city or even suburbs.  They do offer a shuttle service if you choose to park further away!  The airport is clean and has plenty of food options and shopping if that's what you're looking for!  I'll always fly out of this location!"}
{"text":"The only reason I've travelled via PIT was the fact that ERI and BUF were more expensive. I don't mind the 2hr drive from Erie and getting to the airport is easy.  I went thru PIT during spring break season and knew the queue for TSA screening would be long...YAY for Pre-Check! Got in and out of security in about 5 minutes. There were plenty of agents working and getting passengers on their way efficiently. PIT is a bit dated and could use a little revamping in the terminals. Sad to have seen US Airways (pre-American takeover) leave and move major hub activity to PHL; I'm sure at one point it was a really bustling airport. It would be great if the airlines offered more non-stop cities to middle America and the west coast.   All in all, choosing PIT as my destination airport was a good experience and I'd do it again."}
{"text":"I used to travel almost every week for about 5 years so I've been in my share of crummy and good airports, domestically and internationally. (Unlike George Clooney, I never found a Vera Farmiga. Sigh).  PIT sits right about the middle. Monday morning lines are always going to be long in any proper airport; you're going up against the business travelers and unless you're one of us, get the hillel out of the way ;-) Get there extra early and/or get yourself some airline status to use the shorter line. Otherwise, lines are pretty fast during the other parts of the week.  I think PIT ranks just a shade under nicer airports like SFO, MSP, CDG or DFW. But it does markedly better than horror shows like PHL, ORD, LGA or ATL. No, their greater size and traffic is no excuse to being horrible places to fly. (And no US airport will ever compare favorably to the palaces in the Middle East or Southeast Asia). Thus, three stars from your humble narrator."}
{"text":"Last week was my first time at PIT and I did not expect to see the Airport to be well organized, plenty of shop, cafe and restaurants. The airport may not look very new but it was clean, not too confusing. My only complain is that from car rental facilities, you have to get to 3rd floor to check in or get your boarding pass and then back to 2nd floor to clear security. The security line was short and they have special line for passengers with 1 bag which is awesome. Another huge like for PIT is the car rental facilities is within the airport."}
{"text":"Easy to navigate, pretty clean, trendy shops, but expect delays any time of the year!"}
{"text":"This is a great airport. It's virtually guaranteed once you land that you'll have plenty of time for a bathroom break, catch something to eat and get your keys from the rental car guy before you have to show at baggage claim.  Try not to check bags if time is of value."}
{"text":"This review involves a longer story about Great Lakes Christmas Ale. After moving to California, there's been no reliable way to get that sweet nectar into my fridge -- until I conveniently had an 11/11/11 wedding in Pittsburgh to go to. A quick detour back to Ohio and I was out fifty bucks -- but up a 24 back of Christmas Ale, a value that nearly transcends money. How are you going to get it back? my parents ask. Check it? I suggest tentatively. A quick look at the Delta web site indicates that I -can- in fact bring it back, but it might cost more than the standard $25/checked bag because it's a 'fragile' item. So I expected upwards of another fifty to get it back home (still worth it mind you). And then what happens? I go to Delta luggage drop off, comment on the attendent's Vermont lanyard and Bam! FREE CHRISTMAS ALE TRANSPORT.  Dropping off a rental car was a cinch, but I'm gonna have to ding them for their security line. I was leaving at 2:00pm on a Sunday afternoon and ended up waiting in line for upwards of 25 minutes. If my flight hadn't been delayed, I would have definitely sweated it.  Another pro though : there was so much Steelers paraphernalia at this airport that I had a warm, fuzzy feeling the entire time."}
{"text":"Pros: not crowded, shopping, food, newer  Cons: maintenance is slipping, warm and stuffy, way outside of Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I love this place. Small tsa lines and great shopping if you are stuck for awhile. They have everything from nine west to a rite aid.  A rite aid that actually has normal rite aid prices!! It is like a mall in here. Also a wide variety of food spots"}
{"text":"Dirty bathrooms.  Broken faucets. Staff seem miserable."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars except for the fact that it is always so dead when I go there now and they have a real lack of flight options (in comparison to when it was a USAir hub.)  This is one of the best airports that I've been to.  The airport is laid out in a big cross so getting from one gate to another is not ever a problem.  Signage at this airport is very good.  It is pretty easy to find whatever you are looking for such like gate number, baggage claim, rental car return, etc.  The \"Air Mall\" also has a decent number of shops and is not over priced like most airports.  They have a price guarantee that you will not pay more at the store there than you do at a typical mall."}
{"text":"This airport is too big for its current passenger load, since it was built for the USAir hub peak of the 1990s. But that means plenty of space to handle what there is.  Airside is overall strong, with a good range of shops & food especially considering the size of the airport. And the Airmall program protects you from typical airport price gouging. There's a kid play area near C52 that had decayed over the decades but was recently renovated with great equipment.  Landside is a mixed bag. Rental car and transit access is easy. The security line is always awkward. There's very little in the way of restaurants or distractions for anyone waiting to pick up a passenger, but the new myPITpass program at least allows airside access during business hours without a boarding pass."}
{"text":"A sad reminder of the effects of 9/11 combined with US airways pulling out and cutting daily flights to 25% of what they once were.  PIT offers all of the amenities you would want."}
{"text":"Lots of new stores. Always cleaned to the nines. Friendly staff and the lines move pretty quickly. There are a lot of nice restaurant choices no matter what your budget is and they have plenty of parking. I use long-term parking to save the hassle of getting a ride. $8 a day is a steal considering what places like LaGuardia airport charges."}
{"text":"Not sure how one reviews an airport... I mean it's not like you have a choice right? I guess you could drive to Cleveland!?!? It does seem to be rebounding from the changes from 9/11 the shops seems to be doing better and they are getting new places to eat."}
{"text":"Want to know how much I love Pittsburgh International? My family and I, before the laws implemented after 9/11, used to go to the airport to shop and hang out for the day. It was like a fun little trip for my siblings and I when we were little. No, we weren't going anywhere, but it was still fun!   As an adult, I still hold this airport near and dear to my heart! Since being demoted from US Airways-hub status, the airport is a lot less busy these days. I don't mind, though! There are rarely long lines, the people are SO friendly (unlike at most airports, they don't hate their lives), it is clean and there are some unique dining and shopping options. The Air Mall has NO markup for their pricing and has stores like Clinique, Sunglass Hut, Gap, The Body Shop, Nine West, amongst many others.   The airport is also VERY easy to navigate! Woo Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Worst airport for night travel. Everything shuts down at 8pm. Thankful for those airports out there that stay open until the last flight and actually care about us."}
{"text":"It seems like the shopping has decreased every time I visit but the Airport itself is great.  Theres food everywhere \"Pittsburgh style\" and the staff in the building is your typical PITTSBURGH friendly staff."}
{"text":"PIT is fine. Not quite the \"PITs\" hehehe. I does have some unappealing concrete flooring, but there is a central hub for restaurants and shops, which makes it easy to get stuff and get to your flight. They also have a smart tram system where they pick up passengers on one side and drop them off on the other. I wish other planners could have such foresight in crowd control."}
{"text":"Luckily they sell deodorant here, so you can apply some to your Pitts before venturing out into the 'Burgh, which unequivocally has some of the most attractive people in the Great Lakes region, and a hell of a nightlife and sports scene. One of the prettiest and most underrated cities in the country, and it has an excellent airport.  The one problem with the airport - for me - is that it's way, way out in the West part of the region, and the only main road to get you from here to the city centre is usually backed up beyond belief during daylight hours and even at night. I wish there was an alternate route or something. It's also hard to get to from the North, where you have to drive way south down I-79 and then come back up said road.  All that aside, the airport itself is nice, quiet, friendly, not too modern but not run-down either, with plenty of outlets and Wi-Fi and some good food options. It's also a special place for me since I've flown in and out of here sporadically throughout my life, and since I met one of the most amazing girls I've ever seen right here at this airport for the first time.  By the way, when you visit Pitt, eat at:  Steak sandwich with all the sauces at Gaucho Burgatory for Morty's Steakhouse Burger and shakes Las Palmas on Brookline for a Ribeye taco Gali's for Gyros Yovi's for Chicago hot dogs Groceria Merante for a traditional italian deli sandwich Istanbul Grille for everything Big Shot Bob's for Wings (Old Bay.. Wet)  If your car ever breaks down in these parts, go to Michael Johnson Auto in Westview.  Now I have a feeling in the Pitt of my stomach that it's time to end this review."}
{"text":"I go to this airport when I visit Mom and Dad. I beat the rush by using the Alternate Security Checkpoint. The airport is well laid out, with a central eating/shopping area, and concourses extending out on the sides. The new Cell Lot is convenient for Mom when she picks me up."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Bound!  Part XVI  I moved to Atlanta in December of last year from Pittsburgh and had yet to be back.  Virtually every Labor Day weekend of my entire life was spent in Pittsburgh with my parents, as my birthday falls within the window.  I promised my folks that I would make a long weekend out of it, and head on home.  The following reviews are a step-by-step account of the long weekend.  Enjoy!  (For Part XV, go to http://www.yelp.com/review_share/GuWbgXDIi5lmHttow9pWhA/review/QQDBXqJ4PNSyH48DBedqhg?fsid=qGcsH56SzZAN2LuCQyTPTQ)  The Pittsburgh International Airport is a little bit of a mess.  If you park in the lots, you enter on the first floor, check in on the second, and go through security on either the first or third floor.  On this trip, I timed my security check and found it to be considerably easier than I'm accustomed to there.  9 minutes and through which has to be a record time.  The only noteworthy feature worth mentioning is that every traveler that goes through the Pittsburgh airport must pass a series of Madame Tussaud-esque statues featuring Franco Harris reaching for what would eventually be dubbed \"The Immaculate Reception\", and George Washington.    Only in Pittsburgh.  Being a native, I fully understand and agree with the decision, but from an outsider's perspective, I'm sure they are thinking of how enormous the balls of this city's decision makers must be to pair up a legendary football play alongside a founding father of this country.  The statues have been in place for years, but eventually will have to change.  I'm guessing that the next pairing will be statues of Ben Roethlisberger shaking off a defensive lineman with Jesus just off to the right.   The long and short of it, Atlanta, here I come."}
{"text":"We stopped here to kick off a baseball trip weekend, and maybe it was because we arrived at 9am on friday morning, but this place was a ghost town! It was an easy to navigate airport, but the shuttle cost to downtown sucked!"}
{"text":"Only airport I have ever visited that your bag beats you to the pick up. 15 minutes after stepping into terminal I was driving my rental. It's no wonder they were rated best of 2017."}
{"text":"The airport is very nice, and usually not crowded these days.  The problem is there are very few direct flights anywhere, especially to Europe."}
{"text":"Overall - this airport is pretty good.  I had an early flight (depart at 7:00 AM).   I arrived at the airport around 5:30 AM.  The shuttle picked me up before I froze off all my man parts.    I had an easy check in and was able to get a cup of Joe.  Larger is not always better especially when you are pressed for time.   I give this place a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Straight-forward and easy-to-navigate airport that also provides you an unusual homely feeling!  The terminal section of PIttsburgh International Airport (PIT) is composed of four concourses extending from a central zone. The airport provides a decent selection of food and shopping in the center, so it's a decent layover stop. Throughout the premise, everything's placement makes perfect sense and the restroom facilities plus water fountains are sufficient.   If you are flying from this airport, the TSA staff here is friendly and efficient with their job, so you don't have to worry about any delay that is commonly associated with other airport checkpoints.   Because of its history, PIT still retained its antique feel but has not failed to provide modern airport accommodations. While it is certainly not a top-notch airport, PIT is one of the few decent airports that I have been to."}
{"text":"Meh, can't get too excited about an airport.  Aside from the fact that the lines can be pretty long during the week it's pretty much A-OK.  The McDonald's here is awful. I mean I know it's a McDonald's but even by those standards alone it is bad. Worst McDonald's ever.  Pittsburgh has significantly fewer hipsters prancing around in their costumes with their noses in the air. This awesome fact alone is worth a whole star. ;-) So 4-stars overall."}
{"text":"This airport is in desperate need of a renovation! The restaurant options are fairly limited: there's a food court area that has fast food and a few sit down options. The seating areas are big, but without much in the way of charging stations or comfortable chairs."}
{"text":"Whenever I fly into the PIT airport, I get a little side. Before USAir (now American) moved their operations to Philadelphia, this airport used to rock. Great dining & shopping options. After the move by American it was pretty deserted for awhile.  Southwest moved into use some of the gates. The good news is that the lines are not long."}
{"text":"Okay airport. I was stopping by for an hour on the way to NY. The terminal I was in had a ton of shops! Duty-free makeup, perfume, etc store. Nine West. Navajo Indian store? And a ton of places to eat! No matter how early or late you arrive. TGI Fridays, McDonalds, Subway, Quiznos, & a ton of other places. No Starbucks tho!  The airport is quite outdated though! It could use a makeover"}
{"text":"I didn't expect this to be a gem of an airport, but it was. It was clean, the lines moved quickly, and had plenty of AFFORDABLE restaurants. I got food to eat there before I left for the airport, but should have just ate at one of the restaurants there. They also free WIFI. I don't get why LAX, a huge airport doesn't have it yet or Dallas either. Very disappointing since they are such huge airports.   -1 star for 3 reasons: 1. They have few nonstop flights to most major cities. You most likely will have a layover or a connecting flight. 2. I have never seen a merging security line. It looks like they have 2 separate security lines, but they merge! 3. Steeler fans everywhere (I am a Jets fan)."}
{"text":"This is a great airport that is not overcrowded. It is often rated among the best in the country. Even if you have a gate at the far end of the terminal there are moving walkways, even to the parking lots. The floors in the main terminal have recently been redone and they are beautiful. The stores and restaurants here in the airmall are very nice and do not rip you off because legally they have to charge regular mall prices. And no tax on clothing.   There are plenty of sit down restaurants and fast food places too. The Martini bar has locations outside of security and in the main terminal.   Now they are trying a new program where you don't need to be traveling to go to the shops in the airmall or even go to the gate to send off or greet your family or friends.   Getting through security is usually pretty quick and they also have an alternate security checkpoint open during busy times. Lately the TSA pre-check lines have been longer but move quickly.   Here's a tip - if you don't have TSA Pre-check. It's a little known secret (shhh - don't tell anybody!) There is a dedicated security line for first class or preferred travelers. This line can really be used by coach passengers because the TSA can't and don't enforce who uses it. It was just established by the airport as a courtesy for premium travelers. Give it a try and beat the longer regular line. You'll thank me!"}
{"text":"Quick in, quick out, and very friendly. Been to this airport twice and never had any issues with them. It makes it a bit of a drive to the city, and always conjested getting there, but the airport itself was good. Quick and efficient TSA checkpoints (in fact, they directed me to \"other\" checkpoints that were quicker that no one was using, etc.)."}
{"text":"This airport is like a ghost town.  Here is the whole scoop:  Security:  Awful.  It takes forever.  There are only four lines.  I've stood for well over two hours in the mornings and peak travel times.  This would be fine if it was a busy airport, but there are barely any flights in and out.  Not ok.  Seating:  Comfortable and plenty.  Outlets:  I've never even seen one.  Wifi:  Free  Food options:  Plenty of McDonalds.  I would try the other places, but no where is ever open.  I fly about once a month.  You will be hard pressed to find anything to eat here before 630 or 7 in the morning and after 7 at night.  Shops and most food stores hours are far worse than that.  Getting stuck in this airport is torture with this GIANT problem.  Shopping:  PLENTY.  Lots and lots of stores.  Luggage, socks, sunglasses.... Everything you could ever feel like buying in an airport.  Structure:  This is the good part.  The airport is shaped like an X.  It's super easy to get around."}
{"text":"Pretty nice airport. Right when you get off the airplane you smell FOOD. And it smells good. You can see in others pics that there is more than just boring white painted walls like we have at IAH. There is actually things to see and take pictures of while you walk through. You take a little train to get in and out of the terminals. Only one thing I didnt like and it isnt a suprise because well its me and also its an airport, things are SO expensive in all the stores. The TSA makes you throw away all your drinks and what not then you get price gouged inside. Something seems wrong with that. At least the TSA pre check lines work here. IAH TSA pre is almost a joke."}
{"text":"One of the better airports I've traveled to in my years on the road. Parking/Rental Dropoff/etc... signs are somewhat confusing when you try to navigate the roads leading into the airport, but once you're settled it's easy to find your way to TSA Security. Generally, TSA is respectful and the wait times are between 15-30 minutes during business hours. The central hub has interesting shops and eateries, but like most airports they have no idea what \"competitive pricing\" is, especially in terms of adult beverages. They advertise free wifi, but I couldn't get it work on my laptop. All in all, a good experience."}
{"text":"Main security line was long. Airport staff informed folks of a second security checkpoint that had almost no wait. This was very helpful. Airport not crowded. Sufficient charging stations. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"What can be said, its an airport :D, but they do have a nice DINO skelton inside and some cool wax figues of dead presidents and Pitsburgh sports teams."}
{"text":"Having traveled through this airport several times in the last year I have finally got down to writing a review on it.  There is nothing fancy about this airport. The building isn't an architectural miracle.It doesn't have too many eateries but the ones that they have are fairly good. A decent mix of healthy and fast food options. Chef Symon from Iron chef recently opened a restaurant here. However, I haven't eaten there yet but it is pretty packed most of the times I have walked past it.  The reasons I feel this airport deserves 4 stars are for the following : 1. Despite not being dressed up this airport is clean! The bathrooms are nice & I have never found it trashed.  2. The security check is always a breeze. I have never seen a better run security check system or TSA team. It hardly ever takes more than 20 minutes to check in. They used to have a separate line for those with one bag which helped move things along. Unlike some other airport(yes you...Boston Logan) even peak rush hours don't translate to endless long lines and its not because they arent vigilant. Almost every traveller is put through the scanner. The alternate lesser known security check area works well during crunch times.  3. I have yet to see an airport where you can park for $8!! When picking up someone you also get free parking for the first half hour.  This people friendly airport definitely works in my books."}
{"text":"I spent 4 years living in Pittsburgh. I was going to college here. Because I live abroad and flew home twice a year, I must have used this airport at least 8 times. It's a good airport in a great city. How I miss those 4 years in Pittsburgh. They were wonderful growing times, lots of feelings of potential, and lots of promise for a bright future.  *sigh*"}
{"text":"This airport has a straight up WALGREENS in it. A WALGREENS.  How can you not like it? Sure there aren't that many direct flights to Pittsburgh from NYC but there is a WALGREENS in the AIRPORT!  It is small, easy to figure out and easy to get through."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite airport. No joke. First off, they have a Mister Rogers display. Second off, if your flight is delayed, enjoy mall-shopping right in the airport! That's right-- they have regular stores like the Gap and Sunglass hut, all for your perusing pleasure. Go ahead, pick up a few things for your trip.  Thanks Pittsburgh for always being a good time."}
{"text":"Best looking bartender in Fridays that I have seen since Germany. Her eyelashes are long enough to make a breeze!!"}
{"text":"This airport is great. Employees are amazing and since the airport isn't big it's easy to go between terminals. Great food choices and a beautiful design!!!! No reason to give it a bad review"}
{"text":"Love this airport. It isn't a huge airport but it is also by no means small. They recently updated the shopping area so they have a better selection. Hopefully the add more restaurants as well. Also, I hope they add a non-stop flight to Anchorage, AK as I fly there very often. Otherwise, this is a fantastic airport that is very easy to navigate."}
{"text":"This is a cute airport that allows you to come in just to shop even without an air ticket. I like the huge dinosaur statue as well. Everything is very efficient, you won't see any long lines.  There is another security checkpoint that few people know about- it is so quick and fast! The airport is about a 30-40 min drive from downtown, which is not too far."}
{"text":"I entered thru security check in thru A List/First Class line.  Pit to Las on Nov 16th 2013 about 1:00 PM.  After getting thru the X-ray machine I was sitting in a chair putting my shoes back on...soon after a TSA employee stepped over toward me and said\" it's OK if you don't move, the strapping young man doesn't need to sit down...obviously another passenger had just cleared the metal detectors behind me in another row...and that was the person being referred to.  So, this statement did not make sense.  Unless, he was trying to flirt with him or something.  This seemed very odd to me.  Other than that traveling thru PIT was non-eventful.  This airport is not what it used to be.  As so many others."}
{"text":"This review is going to be short, and I wish all flights and layovers were like this. Arrived into this airport 10 minutes before boarding my next flight. My next flights terminal was 2 minutes away. Boarded right as I arrived to the gate and hopped on my next flight. Perfect timing all the way around. Hope to go through here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Who reviews an airport?  Me!  You know what they need at PIT?  They need one of those fancy timers on the security line that says, \"approximately 15 minutes through security\" like they do in \"fancy\" airports.  Ever since USAirways went belly up. . . or. . . belly sideways, since I they're still in business, but at a MUCH less visible level. . . the airport has gone downhill.  Blame the terrorists.    You used to be able to shop at cool places in PIT without a boarding pass. . . now. . . no more.  Stupid terrorists.    I KID!  Don't bomb me!!!"}
{"text":"It's an airport.   I like that they have a gas station very close to the airport, so you can fill up and return the rental car.  It seems like other airports don't want to put up signage to help you out.  They have a good variety of food choices, especially the ben and Jerry's ice cream shop.  Love getting a milkshake after landing."}
{"text":"The place gets two stars simply because planes leave and arrive! The layout of this airport is awful and if would stop trying to be a damn mall perhaps travelers would not have such a hard time getting through Pittsburgh international.  I would recommend getting to the airport at least two hours early the lines are always long and the security line is long as well too."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has a nice airport. Clean, fairly pretty and easy to navigate. Some of the best qualities in an airport!  Free shuttle to most hotels, including ours. Timely arrival and subsequent pick up after my painless Delta flight.  Look forward to success on the return trip as well.  A PS - Excellent return trip - especially since we got to the airport before 7am. I was amazed at how many places have a really good bfast menu, like Charley's and TGI Fridays, and was glad to be able to kill an hour (we all shuttled together but my flight wasn't as early as others) with nice staff in a comfortable spot. Even better airport than I thought on my trip in!"}
{"text":"The Pittsburgh airport isn't too bad compared to many other airports across the country (I'm looking at you, PHL!).  It's a medium-sized airport with a decent number of outbound domestic flights per day (there's only one international flight to France).  Although I never enjoy the hassle associated with flying, it somehow doesn't seem as bad here compared to other airports.  Some of the things that I enjoy about the Pittsburgh airport are the free wifi, the Mr. Rogers exhibit, the 28X bus service (great for those of us without cars who don't want to call our friends to pick us up at 1am, or pay an exorbitant price for a taxi), and the little-known alternate security line (note that this doesn't require extra screening or money, unlike some other airports).  The only major complaint I have is how far it is from downtown, but there's not much that can be done about that.  I can't comment on the shopping or food amenities since I never take advantage of them.  I usually find that arriving an hour prior to takeoff time is more than sufficient for checking any bags and progressing through security, assuming you're on a domestic flight. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Ugly, in bad condition, and smells bad.  If I had to go to Pittsburgh again and could choose a different airport, I definitely would.  On top of that, they have dumb restrictions on Uber car service.  On my arrival, the wi-fi wasn't working.  On departure, it was sort of working but not everywhere."}
{"text":"During my travels all over the place it's nice to have a decent home airport that has friendly faces and for the most part functions better than those other airports.  Having the pre check is a great thing to be sure that you wait much less At the security lines too.  Shops and restaurants are very nice as well."}
{"text":"Apparently having TSA pre-check means nothing here. Contrary to the posted sign, still had to take off boots, belt and sweater. It was such a cluster that it would have been faster to go the regular way. At least there you know what needs to be done, instead of getting attitude....  At least food was good at TGI Fridays."}
{"text":"I flu  from pittsburgh to Sacramento and very big airport   Parking is hard and not easy that munch"}
{"text":"I'm biased since I grew up in Pittsburgh, but this airport is still my favorite. They are constantly doing work to keep this airport fresh and fun with new restaurants and exhibits. I've loved to see the transformation of this airport over the past decade. It's a great place for shopping, dining, and starting a vacation!"}
{"text":"Okay,  so I travel a lot.  I wish I had an airport like this.  I mean, sure it's my hometown airport, but wow, it's still kicking butt in terms of all the airports I've seen.  Note: 1) Free Wi-Fi 2) Go there on its busiest day EVER at its peak time and u *might* wait up to a big 30 minutes - seriously, this place is a tight running ship 3) Decent mall inside (no sales tax on clothing in PA) 4) Ground crew is super quick - I barely ever have to wait on my luggage 5) Say hi to the dinosaur and other history artifacts...I find it interesting  So this place used to be a USAirways Hub, but someone must have screwed something up so it became a secondary hub, then downgraded to be a \"focus city\".  It's a shame, but it makes the airport a lot less congested because there's definitely more terminals than needed.  Okay, did I mention I love it here?  I wish the USAirways execs made Pittsburgh the international hub, not Philadelphia.  *sigh*  Oh yeah - my new fav: Southwest Airlines flies here..w00t!"}
{"text":"When they first opened Pittsburgh International as it is now, I was but a wee lad, and it was such a cool, new, modern place back then, especially to a wide-eyed toddler on maybe his fourth or fifth airplane ride of his life.  Vaulted ceilings, people movers, the tram, all of these things were a thrill for a little kid, especially one destined to become an aviation nerd.  Nowadays, Pittsburgh International appears much more mundane.  The carpets are a bit more worn, the once-brand-new walls a little bit dirty, the carrier that made the giant size of the airport appropriate long ago having dropped it as a hub.  With US Air's one-way ticket into history as our flagship carrier, the huge complex has gone from being an exciting transportation hub to a place where you do a lot of walking.  And that's really my only complaint with the airport.  It is a LOT of walking.  I'd hate to not be able-bodied there, but then I guess I could get a ride on their little golf carts.  Check-in and security are both about the same as anywhere else.  They suck, but there's just no avoiding that.  The cool thing is that because of the landside-airside terminal layout, you're not very confined when you get to the other side of security.  The airmall may be expensive, but there are plenty of places to eat, order a few drinks, and generally veg out while you're waiting.  This is much better than many airports I've seen.  I've also never had a plane be late departing from PIT, which is more than I can say for many other airports.  Another thing I can say that is not true for many other airports is that the wireless internet is FREE.  Why any airport would charge for wireless is beyond me, but some do.  Pittsburgh is nice enough to just let you have it.  All in all, if you don't mind getting your walking in for the day, you could do way worse than Pittsburgh International."}
{"text":"I think growing up and using PIT Airport all the time, I took for granted how nicely designed it is.  I love that there's a Rite Aid and I absolutely love the U.S. Post Office. This is the only airport I can easily buy postcards, write them while waiting and mail them all in a matter of ten minutes.  PIT is also very easy to navigate and you're not stuck with fast food only options if you have a long amount of time until your departure.   Each time I see the George Washington statue or our T Rex I think.. YAY I will see my family soon.  Believe me DFW doesn't have such iconic images. They just have Hudson's, a Dickey's BBQ which should be illegal we let others think that's real Texan BBQ and lots of knick knacks."}
{"text":"Small airport with all the amenities at a much more affordable price than other airport stores.   Easy to find your gate, rental cars and the hotel shuttles"}
{"text":"We love traveling in and out of Pittsburgh International Airport. There are monitors everywhere to keep you abreast of scheduling. Everything is clearly marked in regard to gates, baggage claim, etc. The tram runs every few minutes so you won't even get delayed there. Even during their construction is was easy peasy."}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of my favorite airports.  The layout just flows and feel that things are just easy here.  It's not confusing when you drive up to drop someone off or pick someone up, it's intuitive.  You get in, drop off your bag, wait in a line and go to your terminal.  There is a shuttle that runs frequently to take you to other terminals but it's walkable too."}
{"text":"I am not a frequent air traveler but I have been to enough airports to feel confident enough to rate them according to my personal experiences.   This review is passenger based since I do not know enough about the trails and tribulations associated with being a driver arriving for passenger pick up or short term parking  The airport facilities are very clean, modern looking, and inviting.  Signs for maneuvering through the airport are easy to follow.  If one is unsure of their destination, a staff member will guide you in a friendly manner.  Prices for food and drinks are affordable and in line with other dining spots away from airport property.  The only comment I have, is in regards to the hours of operation for these establishments. I am not sure what dictates these hours, but most of the places were closed, or closing, before 9pm during my last visit. So many travelers were trying to find a place to dine without much luck.  Other than this small inconvenience, I am very pleased overall with their services.  Even better than my endorsement,  I am happy to relay that Pittsburgh Airport recently became the first U.S. airport to be named Airport of The Year by Air Transport Magazine. Previous honorees include Hong Kong Iternational, London Heathrow, and Singapore Changai.  Well done Pittsburgh International for your busiest year since 2008!"}
{"text":"This airport has a fully decked out mall. You take a tram to baggage claim - that's how big it is. I arrived on an early Saturday morning & I was a little disappointed by the lack of healthy options for breakfast. On the way back, there was a line for TSA but it moves along fairly fast."}
{"text":"This is more of a quaint regional airport than a thriving international airport. My driver told me that it used to service 20 million customers a year but now it is down to 4 million. The plus side of the decline is that nothing takes long: you whiz through security, there are no long lines to eat, and parking is plentiful. On the downside, there aren't a lot of places to eat, and while there are some power stations for phones and laptops, they are fairly infrequent. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I did not have any problems or complaints."}
{"text":"Considering the size of Pittsburgh, this airport is really large. Really large, but with almost no traffic. Seriously, my terminal was like a ghost town, even though it was a Sunday afternoon. It was actually pretty relaxing, if surreal!  Pittsburgh's airport was on the older side, but despite the larger size it was a pretty quick in and out, with no major issues or problems. Food was not outstanding, but McDonald's is ok once in awhile! :-) My main complaint is that the airport was a really long way from Pittsburgh and extremely inconvenient to get to. My friend and I drove from the other side of the Pittsburgh, and it took us over an hour to get there in no traffic!!! I know airports are usually outside of major city centers, but Pittsburgh's airport takes this to a whole new level, especially considering the size of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This is the best airport in all the land. Really. If you don't believe me you are probably from Cleveland or Baltimore or Cincinnati and you just hate it on principle."}
{"text":"Pretty large and largely empty as others have mentioned, but I had pleasant experiences. Flew Southwest from Chicago for a quick weekend trip.  Arrived way too early on the way back so had plenty of time to explore. While there is a ton of ground to cover, a lot of the vendors (TGI Fridays for example) simply had a storefront in each concourse. While there were a bunch of food options, I strangely felt like I've seen more variety at smaller airports. Some nicer shopping options as well (PGA store, jewelry, Brooks Brothers).  Very tiny gripe regarding Southwest is they do not have the metal lineup barriers here, so each boarding group just lines up along the wall. I thought this was because Southwest JUST started flying here, so I was surprised to learn they've had service for over 10 years. Perhaps it's just an issue of the gate area layout."}
{"text":"I will say that directions to this airport is well done, great signage. If you are returning a rental you have to go all the way up to the third floor to check in then back to the second floor for TSA..... There is not a lot foodie places inside the terminal and what's there is blah. The cool thing is when you get to where the gates are its a 4 way split very easy to navigate."}
{"text":"Au Bon Pain left.  But first, this is one of the nicer airports I know.  I also like San Francisco's (museum exhibits in the terminal, nice Air Train to car rental, connection to BART (transit)) and Amsterdam's Schiphol and Frankfurt's airport (train stations downstairs!).  Sad news about Pittsburgh's airport: apparently Au Bon Pain pulled out of the airport in January 2010 and Nature's Kitchen replaced them.  At Nature's Kitchen earlier this week, I ordered my food and asked for it on a paper plate, but my quiche (a triangle, 3 inches on a side) was served on a huge styrofoam dinner plate (with dividers, like a cafeteria plate) and a big plastic lid.  Excessive packaging - all those hydrocarbons going to waste!  And they microwaved the food on the styrofoam plate.  Health experts warn not to do this - possible release of toxic chemicals when you microwave plastics.  And the quiche did not taste fresh.  Two spinach quiches and a Snapple were $22.  This is excessive.  So much for \"Regular Mall Prices ... Guaranteed\" (the Pittsburgh airport mall slogan).  I like the airport but I don't like Nature's Kitchen.  I want Au Bon Pain back!"}
{"text":"I feel as though the airport has really gone down hill since it is no longer a US Airways hub.  There are not many food options.  There appear to be based on the map in the center concourse, but when we were last there, half of them were closed.  Everything closes earlier than I have ever seen at another airport.  This time we had no security issues (there were very few people in the airport); however, most of the time, the security lines are just too long for the size of the airport.  The airport is old and outdated.  The finishes that you would expect in an airport are just not there.  Good luck charging your phone or laptop as those amenities are few and far between.    Here is why I did not give it one star: 1.  The people are nice - always nice!!! 2.  Car Rental is easy"}
{"text":"This is my favorite airport ever. It's smaller, but still a decent sized international airport. The coolest part about this airport, besides how clean it is, is theres basically an entire mall and a ton of restaurants in there, and you're allowed to go shop even if you're not flying....just gotta go thru security....so you can meet family at their gate too.... employees are surprisingly friendly for airport staff. Really the best airport ever."}
{"text":"I have to say that after my recent travels I love the Pittsburgh airport! Easy to navigate. You can sit at a quiet table and enjoy something to eat before boarding. I can even give myself extra time before going out of town because going through security doesn't take that long.  Picking up friends and family is extra quick and quite the simple process. Jumping on the transit to get to the gates is never inconvenient and they move back and forth without a wait. I have to say that I am usually traveling to much larger airports but when I get back home and see the T-Rex and the Steeler Nation player and gear! I feel so at home! I swear that the Boston airport is my biggest nightmare and what a shit show! Yes Pittsburgh air ROCKS! Can't wait till my friend gets in town so we can compare notes on how Boston needs a new airport location!"}
{"text":"I am seriously debating on getting here early JUST to hang out. Tribute to local historical things such as a little sitting nook for Tuskegee Airmen, Andy Warhol prints/wallpaper, and humble farm beginnings of what is now Pittsburgh International Airport. There is a Rite Aid, Post Office plenty of places to eat! Need to charge your phone? Charging stations with all cords for FOUR types of chargers.   Ample choices of food, drink, and even light shopping; what more can you ask for in an airport.   There was an alternate security checkpoint across the street from the main airport and whew, I was through in less than 10 minutes! There was a nice airport personnel trying to convince people to go and it seemed all too good BUT I am so glad I listened to him.  This airport is easy to navigate and was awarded the ATW Airport of the Year 2017; I can totally see why."}
{"text":"Celebrating Mr Rogers today.  What a great day to be traveling in and out of Pittsburgh.  The love is alive and well.  Having spent my young childhood years in Pittsburgh in the late 60's and early 70's I can assure you that this is a wonderful way to temper him.    Got my red shoe laces and official fan club pin.  Now wheels up."}
{"text":"Fair warning. Security screening at this airport is terrible. If you get shunted down the backscatter xray line and refuse for whatever reason ie: pregnancy, excessive caution, purely on principal etc you must get the pat down.  they will make you wait for an extended amount of time for said pat down.  They had me stand to the side for over ten minutes while dozens of other folks go to walk thru the metal detector and didn't get a second look see. If you refuse the backscatter xray, hopefully you're not running late for your flight."}
{"text":"I find more and more I'm spending a lot of time in airports. Pittsburgh is no exception, and is turning into something I might even call a home. Except I wouldn't because I'm not Tom Hanks.  Pittsburgh Airport is nothing special. It is nice that they give you free wifi, which totally makes up for the lack of anything good to eat. And by good to eat, I mean not fried, carbo-loaded, or 99% sugar. Whenever I leave Pittsburgh I always make sure to eat beforehand or make sure I have something in my bag. It's just not the place for food.  ALSO, since I've now flown through there 5 times in the last month or so, I have to really recommend showing up early. I have seen so many people freaking out that they're going to miss their flights because they were late. You know what? I fought the same effing traffic you did and i still managed to make sure I showed up early enough to not rush through the airport like a crazy person. The airport ain't that big, but they never seem to use all the security machines, even if they do have 10-15 security people working the two open machines...  I digress...  Show up early and bring food. That's the point of this rant."}
{"text":"We were flying out of Pittsburgh for our Bahamas trip. Since we live 3-4 hours away it was required that we had to find somewhere to put our car unless we planned on shipping it overseas. We parked in Extended parking which was relatively easy to find with signs giving directions. It was $8 a day max, so in total $40 for the duration of 5 days we stayed parked. Not too bad compared to what we could have paid elsewhere. It is a long haul if you're walking into the airport but a free shuttle is constantly awaiting picking up the new arrivals parking at the airport. Got to us relatively quickly since my body was still not out of the car when it pulled up.   The ride to the airport was easy and pain free. There were spots to throw your luggage but enough room in the seats to toss it next to you since you almost have the whole shuttle to yourself...almost.   It was painless getting to our airline aisle, and everyone was helpful with questions. The girl that took care of us to get our plane tickets was extra extra cheery and just made the process so much less stressful.   The process of going through security checkpoint was fast but the one we went to with a no wait line was somewhere across the airport so we had to take the train shuttle to get there, and get back.   The airport was full of a huge selection of stores and restaurants so even with a 3 hour wait for boarding, you have plenty to do.   Otherwise the airport wasn't too packed so it was easy to get around without running into people with our carry on bags. One of the better airports I've been through."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, Pittsburgh International!  So many memories - I''m giving this 4 stars based on memory alone for today I could not possibly give it more than a 2 or 3.  PIT was the place where I first set foot on US soil - back in the day!  Yes, there was a time when the \"International\" was more than Toronto - with flights from London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris.  I flew in from London and cleared Immigration which was a pleasure - again, back in the day when we actually welcomed people into our country!  Having lived in Pittsburgh for a long time, I know PIT better than I know my own home back there.  I'm serious.  As a heart attack.  From 2003 to 2007, when I calculated the amount of time my car spent in the airport parking lot to the time it spent in my garage, the airport won, 83% to 17%.  So believe me when I say PIT and I go way back :D  It's not very easily accessible though there is a bus that runs from the city to the airport.  Access into the city is through a tunnel which can present a very significant bottleneck at rush hour.  OK, now to the airport!  I always thought PIT was designed by a perfectionist who had no vision for the future.  It's laid out to facilitate the most efficient optimization of common resources like check-in, security, restaurants and retail.    Parking is ample and logically placed though there's almost no covered parking.  This presents a challenge in winter when I've spent many a freezing night scraping ice off the windshield while I slowly lost sensation in all my extremities!!!  Securing the terminal is a breeze since everything and everybody must pass through a single bottleneck well designed bottleneck) to even access the sterile areas of the terminal.  Bottlenecks do seem to be a recurring theme in Pittsburgh!  The concourses are laid out in the form of a giant X - with a central lobby with some fantastic retail and restaurant options (alas, most of these are now closed).  The once magnificent US Airways Club is in the central lobby, atop a special escalator to a higher level.  Around the wide open central lobby  are the retail establishments.  Pittsburgh was the first airport in the country to set up a retail mall environment and guarantee mall pricing in the airport instead of gouging the passengers.  Other major airports would follow this groundbreaking trend!  Plenty of bathrooms, fast food and some sit down restaurant options.  Airline gates are within the four arms of the X - and retail, dining and restroom facilities within the arms are limited.  No last minute drinks before your flight if you are at the end of one of these concourses.  But this design makes expanding the terminal a nightmare!  Only way to do it would be to lengthen the arms, making the journey to the gates even longer!!!  So, poor vision for the future.  Or is it?  When US Airways decided to stop using Pittsburgh as their hub, the airport kind of imploded and now uses less than 25% of its gate capacity.  Most retail and dining establishments are closed (or close real early).  So, the airport hasn't really needed to expand.  Winter weather does cause some havoc but PIT has excellent de-icing facilities so there is rarely a backup of planes waiting to get sprayed before taking off into the icy wind.    If Yelp had check-ins when I used to fly out of PIT, I would have had a little over 450 and wouldn't just be Duke but Super Arch Emperor Incarnate of this airport.  ~ 4 stars overall.  A giant T-Rex statue, George Washington, Franco Harris!!!  Part of my heart and soul continue to live at PIT though it saddens me to see it reduced to a second tier airport in the present day.  Hopefully it will resurrect itself and return to its past glory soon :)    # 209"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better airports I have been through. All of the people that work here were happy and friendly and I was able to find my way through the airport from one gate to another. The architecture is nothing special and the building could be plopped anywhere in the US. Even after 5 years, I still have Atlanta and LA on my mind when thinking about airports, and this one comes up so much higher."}
{"text":"Airport purgatory.  A big, massive, inconvenient airport that has 6 baggage claims, 4 concourses, 1 airtrain and 1 terminal TOO MANY.   It should have 2 baggage claims, 1 concourse, NO airtrain and 1 terminal.  An airport in ICU on the verge of death, hanging on for life.  Too expensive to euthanize, depressing to watch die.  It's sad and creepy and smelly and depressing.  Like a dying great-aunt.  Food sucks too."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is a solid airport- perfect size and good layout. I have flown out of here and dc my entire. It is wonderful airport- the place is clean and is getting renovated currently. Usually a smooth experience."}
{"text":"Huge airport with plenty of shops & food options.  Unfortunately for them, its mostly empty.  It would make for a great international airport.  One issue I do hear about from the locals... cabs, especially for later flights, are hard to come by.   Also if you like taking photos with a Franco Harris statue, then this is your place."}
{"text":"It is spacious and serves its purpose.  I do like that a TSA pre check lane is available here because it can help tremendously with getting in and out quickly.  Sometimes.  For some reason the line here was very long and I am just happy I had a lot of time to catch my flight without rushing.    I am not exactly sure how I managed to miss the ticketing counter when flying out of here, but I did.  After 6 years of constant travel this has never happened.   So, just pay attention."}
{"text":"Great airport, one of the original to add shopping. See George Washington, dinosaurs and Franco Harris making the Immaculate Reception. Easy access and no shuttle for the rental cars."}
{"text":"Picking up some friends and had 2 hours to kill because of bad weather (it's Pittsburgh in January there's always bad weather)  so at 8:00 on a Friday night every  Restaurant and bar in the airport  is closed. What the f@ck ?!"}
{"text":"I have flown from Las Vegas to Pittsburgh International a handful of times now, almost always around the holidays. Holidays are typically a very busy, and therefore rather stressful time to travel. Thankfully this airport has many qualities that make it a pleasant place to arrive or depart from.   Parking is ample and inexpensive, short term parking is just $1 for the first hour ($3 per hour for additional hours). I usually fly Southwest Airlines and the employees at the Southwest gates are always friendly and helpful.  I have never spent more then 15 to 20 minutes waiting in security lines.   There are somewhat limited options for food if you don't care for T.G.I.Friday's. Personally, T.G.I.Friday's suits me just fine. One of the locations has 6 packs of beer you can purchase to take with you, perfect for when you have a layover! It also had a machine where you could buy lottery tickets!   Probably the best thing about Pittsburgh International is the abundance of shops to choose from. It's pretty much a mall, with a Gap, a Nine West and even a Swatch store!   Overall, not a bad place to fly into or out of at all."}
{"text":"Excellent airport always clean small crowds easy to get in and out of and a decent food court."}
{"text":"love the franco harris there to meat me when i get off the plane....go steelers!"}
{"text":"The fact that today 53 Haitian children who've been orphaned by the recent devastating earthquake arrived at the Pittsburgh Airport (and will be transported to Pittsburgh Children's Hospital for care) inspired me to finally review the airport.  This place stirs up bittersweet emotions in me since passing through it means that I'm either going home (happy face) or leaving home (sad face).  Sure, the airport could be updated, a little more modern; however, the airport and its amenities truly verge on perfection when one considers how many people travel through the airport annually and the general size of the city of Pittsburgh.  The X-shaped design is absolutely ingenious.  The ticketing/security portion of the airport is located separately from the 4 terminals (A, B, C, D), and you have to take the speedy tram to get to all of the terminals.  Once you hop off the tram and ascend the escalators you're in the center of the X, with the 4 terminals--the \"legs\" of the X, if you will--protruding from this central spot.  So smart, so simple!  Plus there are just all sorts of fun things to see and do in this area of the airport--a statue of Franco Harris making the immaculate reception, a T. Rex skeleton, restaurants, and the Airmall for some tax-free shopping.   The major, major downside of the airport is that visitors, unless they're actually staying in or traveling to downtown, never get to see the city at all.  The airport is a good ~20 miles from the city; it's actually located on quite a rural stretch of land!  The Pittsburgh skyline, the bridges, the rivers--they're awesome sites to behold, so it bums me out that not everyone flying through the Pittsburgh Airport gets a taste of one of my favorite cities in the world."}
{"text":"This airport a) thinks its on par w/ NYC and b) is no where near Pittsburgh.  To get to any kind of short term parking you have to drive halfway around the airport. But you dont know that until you get inside because all the Short term parking signs have signs over them saying \"closed\". Once you get inside from long term parking, youll walk almost a full mile to the security and ticketing part of the airport. After security, youll take a NYC type shuttle to the actual terminal. Why these 2 buildings need to be separate, I have  no idea. its asinine.  Ok, now that Ive gotten that out, the good points. On the ticketing level, the electronic boarding pass machines are before the lines, so you dont need to wait in line to use them. There are also machines all over the security level that will let you print your boarding passes for 6 selected airlines. The security line moves so amazingly quickly, it was very impressive. Once you get to the second building, all the terminals are clearly marked.  Oh, and did I mention that Pittsburgh International is no where near Pittsburgh. Cuz its no where near Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A very clean, easy to navigate airport albeit a little sleepy.  I had a quick day trip for work and was happy to see Pitt Airport was easy to navigate both coming and going.  Car rentals are located on the ground floor near baggage claim.  While I was there, a number of gates in the terminal were not in use.  It created a very quiet area (if you had time to kill) where you could doze off or work without being bothered by the crowds.  Shops and restaurants don't stay open particularly late.  My flight was delayed, and around 9pm I began to see restaurants officially shut down for the night.  Make sure you grab your snack and magazines early if you're waiting for a late plane.  Cool thing available - express massage area in one of the storefronts.  Something like $20 for 15 mins and up."}
{"text":"I must say this is my 1st time flying Pittsburgh international and on the spirit airline the airport was clean and I had a speedy flow through and spirit has very roomy sits and I had a disability and I had plenty of leg room I will fly again"}
{"text":"I've flown to and through the Pittsburgh airport on many occasions. Sadly, it's now much more of a \"barren desert\" than ever, since airlines keep pulling their flight schedules away from PIT.   On the positive side, there is still plenty of eating and shopping here... maybe even more than I've seen at some larger international airports. There are sit-down options such as TGIFridays, and quick bites like Sbarro and Charley's; plenty of news stands to grab a paper or drink before take-off, too!   Upon landing at PIT, there are many rental car options and there's a local city bus that runs about twice an hour, too. I've used it a couple times and it works out really well (just be sure you have appropriate change). From the bus loop, you're just a quick walk from the City's best destinations."}
{"text":"It's improving over the years. It's still sad to come back through the airport and see how dead that it is at times when any other airport is busy at the same time. There is a serious lack of direct flights to a lot of major cities from major airliners. The upcoming direct flights to Europe should be helpful.  Almost every other airport other than Detroit or Cincinnati is head and shoulders above PIT."}
{"text":"Best Airport IMHO. Why oh Why is this NOT a HUB?? Shakes fists at UASsAIR! grrr...   Best Airport by Design, the Spoke design makes all connections the same distance apart...Smart. I love that the mall shops are same price inside/outside the airport. The Erkert Drug store is super handy and has reasonable prices. There are nice clean restaurants, Clean facilities. It makes me sad that it is not used better as a central hub.  Maybe someday I can get a direct flight from SEA to PIT and I will be a happy girl, indeed... as currently I want to punch myself in the face rather than fly through Philly and take that damn people mover bus, terminal to terminal in that sh!thole airport. :\ How is that For real?!"}
{"text":"The five stars is based on the great shopping in the central area of the terminal.  The security lines are the worst and check-in counters are outdated and not designed to handle the crowds of current times."}
{"text":"This is a nice airport.  It is very clean and the people seem friendly.  The layout is well planned and traffic flow is great.  It seems like the airport is a lot bigger than it needs to be for the traffic that comes through.   I like it when the rental car depot is actually attached to the airport like it is here and you do not have to take a shuttle to get to the rental cars.  The airport also has plenty of food choices.  The bottom line is this is a very nice airport if you get a chance to fly into Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've flown in and out of this airport approximately three or four times per year since I started working for a company based in Pittsburgh in 2009. Here are my thoughts regarding the airport...  PROS:  -Check points: The TSA agents are fantastic at this airport. They always greet me with a smile, and the lines generally move pretty quickly.  -Transportation: Getting from the Landside Terminal to the Airside Terminal is quick, easy, and straightforward.  -Delays: I've had very limited flight delays when flying out of this airport.  CONS:  -Aesthetics: You can easily see that US Airways pulled out of Pittsburgh ten years ago because this airport could use a lot of renovation love.  -Shops & Restaurants: Though understandable that a smaller airport like PIT would have limited shops and restaurants, this airport does not have a Starbucks or even any other chain coffee shop. Doesn't every airport have a Starbucks?!"}
{"text":"This airport makes me feel so sleepy because of the dim-lit environment/lighting. It's nice that its not so much hustle bustle, or large enough to get lost, but overall its outdated, silent like a library, and inconvenient. I love how it's nearly nowhere near Pittsburgh for that matter lol. But then again, pretty much anything in PA is miles and ages within each other. There is barely anything to choose to eat from here, or shop for necessities. :\ I like the Pittsburgh pride of the Steelers and historical stuff on display, but it gets old fast after living there for so long. The parking lot is abundant. It's easier to find your way and the lines are less tedious. It still has room for improvement however."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the higher than expected quality of the airport and the large size. Much of the terminals are new and modern. The distance from the airfield terminal and the main terminal are a surprise which requires a tram ride."}
{"text":"Very easy airport to navigate. I rented a car from Budget and was able to get it returned and checked into my flight within 15 minutes. The car rentals are right at the airport so you don't have to worry about a shuttle. I Hopped right on to the train to get to the terminal. It has a lot of options for food and shopping too."}
{"text":"I've flown out of this airport about a gazillion times since living in the 'Burgh, so it's high time to give this baby a review!  Poor PIT is a huge airport (built to be a hub for US Air only to have them back out shortly after) that is vastly underutilized. So the place always looks like a ghost town. Frankly, that's a-okay with me, because I don't particularly enjoy pushing my way through crowds or bumping into harried travelers running to make their connections. Of course, this also means that you can't fly *everywhere* from PIT, but they have enough domestic flights (and even a seasonal international flight to Paris) that allow you to get to most major cities without too much hassle.  The airport itself consists of a landside terminal where you check in and go through security, and then an airside terminal with food, lots of shopping, and, of course, the terminals. It's a one-minute train ride to get from one to the other, and the train comes every few minutes. I've found the security lines here to be fast and efficient (I mean, as far as airport security lines go...they aren't ever going to be lightning fast, ya know?), and there is even an alternate security line on the second floor that no one seems to know about (just follow the signs guiding you to the \"Alternate Security Checkpoint\"). The layout of the airside terminal is very intuitive, making it easy to navigate. It's a hub and spoke design with the shopping and food in the center and the terminals branching out from center. Bonus: free wi-fi throughout the terminal!  Getting to the airport itself is a bit of a pain, as it's fairly far away from the city, and it seems like these days there is always traffic on Parkway West in that direction no matter the time of day. So definitely allow a bit of extra time for that if you drive. I typically pay to park my car in the Extended Lot for $8/day, which depending on the length of your trip, is typically cheaper than a cab or an Uber. Even during peak travel times (e.g., on Thanksgiving Day itself), I've always been able to find a spot in the lot. You can also reserve a spot online beforehand and save a bit of money. There are shuttle busses from the lot that take you to the landside terminal and I've never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes for a bus to roll by.  I do wish PIT offered more flights to more destinations, but they seem to working on that. Overall, it's a very easy in, easy out airport, and I'm grateful to have that in our city. Happy travels!"}
{"text":"I really like Pittsburgh Airport. Easy to park, not too far to walk to the check in. It's Christmastime and the airport was nicely decorated. A gentleman played a baby grant piano as we checked into SouthWest. There were convenient bowls of starlight mints everywhere. Security was fast, friendly, and professional. Stress free, even at peak holiday travel.  From there you take a short, fast train to the terminal. Super fast, super efficient. Look out for a cool fake T-Rex skeleton as you enter the terminal. People enjoy throwing money in the base to support the Carnegie Museum. There are many cool places to shop in the airport and the prices aren't as outrageous as you might think. Compared to the throngs at the shopping malls, the airport turned out to be a crow-free place to shop today.  I know it's Christmas and everyone is on their best behavior (Santa is watching!) but I enjoy coming to PIttsburgh Airport. I cannot say the same about BWI. Or Dulles. Or Philadelphia..."}
{"text":"A much better menu than most Friday's. Excellent service. Extremely high quality food. Blue Moon beer on tap."}
{"text":"I was actually quite impressed! From arrival at gate to baggage pickup was only 20 mins total time. My flight arrival gate was D-76 and it was really cool that right opposite this gate, there was a post office. The walk from my gate to baggage claim was easy because of the well placed informational signs everywhere plus real cool decor, esp the T-Rex bones!!  The great signage everywhere make it easy to get to where you are going and so pretty happy with arrival. Will update review for departure.  Note: #312 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016"}
{"text":"We flew into PIT from Charlotte, and then back out to Cincinnati.  Getting through Security was not bad - there was a long line - but they opened a line for folks with only one bag, so I got through fairly quickly. Never seen a one bag line at any other Airport before!  It was a hot day out - mid 80s and the Airport did not seem to know they needed to turn the AC on. We got down to our gate on the D Concourse for a Delta flight - and it was very uncomfortable. No cool/cold air was coming from any of the vents. We had about 4 hours until our flight to Cincinnati.  A number of other travelers were complaining about the temperature as well. Finally, after about two hours, late in the afternoon, someone finally activated the AC and cold air began to flow in our area, and the gate area finally became comfortable.  There are plenty of food options, as well as shopping venues here in the Airport.  Electrical outlets are hard to find here. Our Delta gate had a few of the electrical stations - with both electrical outlets and USB charging outlets - but there were too few of these. Everyone was competing to sit around these - there needs to be a lot more areas to plug in and recharge.  If the Airport did a better job with managing the temperature, I would raise my rating of the Airport.  Please note that until Yelp corrects it - the correct address for this business listing is:  Pittsburgh International Airport 1000 Airport Blvd Coraopolis, PA 15108 (412) 472-3525 http://www.pitairport.com/"}
{"text":"Overall, this is a pretty solid airport. Easy to get in and out of even with security lines that weren't that quick, but not bothersome. The central concourse is more of a shopping mall than anything else, but a welcome difference to the stale terminals of many airports. Plenty or dining, drinking, and shopping options. Some of the terminals and wait areas could use some updating, but this is a very comfortable airport to wait in."}
{"text":"Clean airport, friendly staffs, not crowded. Rental cars across from the airport, within walking distance. Wish it has more restaurants."}
{"text":"Why the hell isnt allegiance airlines on yelp every other airline is but not the one I picked which fucking blows worse airline in the world horrible service fkn 4 hours late then they didn't even have pilots for the flight then our plane gets here and then it's having mechanical problems. Worse air line in the world wouldn't recommend them for anyone"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that an airport could be even deemed good in today's era with excessive delays, horrible security lines, and pitiful food options. As far as my experience goes, my time spent at this airport has been great.   Very minimal security line and then a quick tram ride to the main terminal similar to Dulles or Atlanta. Once you get to the main area, there are tons of restaurants and stores/shops. It's very open and not too crowded. It makes you feel more at ease than at LAX where it's hustle bustle all the time. I got a breakfast panini at the fresh cafe across from McDonalds, and it was pretty good with eggs being prepared fresh in front of me.   Overall I'm very satisfied with this airport and the amenities it offers. The spacious terminal is great with plenty of space to go sit and relax."}
{"text":"Had a quick stop here during the snow in DC. Stopped here for about an hour until we got the ok to head back to DC.    The airport was empty. Only a deli was open and i was starving.. I ordered and mocha and BLT.  It was good. I felt bad for the employee he was the only one working :( no help. the line started to get long. He was taking his time so thats good. I wouldnt want anyone rushing my food."}
{"text":"LOVE this airport, and I've been in a lot of freaking airports. When I lived in LA I used to cry and curse at the air, confused as to why LAX couldn't  be more like PIT. I actually get excited to come here and ride the tram! Then, if I'm really early I will sample the body butters at the Body Shop, check out face creams at Clinique and have a beer at O'briens. What is it about airports that make you feel ok about boozing at 10am? It's the most exciting feeling. Even a snack at TGI Fridays feels like an adventure. I am also convinced that PIT has the best selection of people for people watchin'- hours of good natured entertainment!! This place is always clean, even the restrooms! And that is a unique quality that is not often present in most airports. I love you, PIT and can't wait to see you again in 5 days, cause I know you will be here to welcome me, like an old friend, when I return!! Xoxo"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh International is my second favorite airport. It's quite big, clean, easy to navigate, and I don't think I've ever been delayed flying out of here.   Wish it had free WI-FI like many of the other airports I've been too, but I'm just being picky. ((other people's reviews say its free, but i swear the last time I tried to connect they tried to charge me. I could be wrong though))   The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is basically the location. It is almost 20 miles from downtown and there aren't too many feasible options for getting there except by driving. Sure the PAT bus runs from Carnegie Mellon in Oakland, through downtown, to Greentree, on to Ross, before finally reaching the airport, but this ride (especially during high volume traffic times) takes upwards of 1.5 hours. Sure you can take a cab but be willing to pay a hefty fee if you do.   But all in all, a great airport to travel from."}
{"text":"Love the friendly and nice TSA workers here....such a sharp contrast to the workers at LAX. What is it about LAX that makes their TSA workers so angry and miserable?!  Lots of places to eat and prices aren't jacked up as high as other airports. There's also Hyatt regency connected to the airport so if you're looking for a short layover stay, Hyatt would be perfect. It's a straight connect, so you never have to leave the airport to get there and the walk is about 5 minutes."}
{"text":"You can tell that at one point there was a lot o business out of this airport. It seems that since Sept 11th this place has been relatively deserted. But there is a whole mall here and a bit of a museum. US Airways has a nice club and it seems that there should be enough business to warrant more flights in and out of here. Either way, this airport is seeped in aviation history and I worry that it will close if more business isn't to be had .  I think there are flights to Canada from here, which constitute the international title it has, but it really seems that more could and should be happening at the station."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best airports that I have been to. Easy access to and from the airport, not a long drive to downtown and the stadiums on the north shore.   Once inside the airport, wait times to check in for the different airlines are not long at all. All of the concourses are very close to each other and the walking distance between the four concourses is not very great.  The one downside is that the area for  security checks is a bit congested and the line can back up at times but with that being said they move you through quickly.  Many options are available for dinning and shopping. There is a great store in concourse B where you can buy anything Pittsburgh sports related.    You can still get direct flights to and from many cities in the US.  All and all this is a great airport."}
{"text":"I've been here like three times this year and I'm constantly surprised at how quickly security moves. The only thing I don't like is having to go through security and then having to take the train to the gates. It does come pretty fast though and I guess saves you a long-ass walk. The mall in here is great, has a wide range of shops and \"fast food\" such as Clinique, Victoria's Secret, Sunglass Hut, Rite Aid, and I usually grab a sandwich from Au Bon Pain and take it on the plane with me.   Bonus: No sales tax on clothing.  What more can I say?"}
{"text":"I've rolled through Pittsburgh a zillion times which makes it funny to think this was my first time to their airport. Key takeaways: easy to navigate, free wifi, impressive shopping options (they have a Desigual - one of only handful in the US - cool women's fashion store from Spain). It appears that they are currently updating several areas of the airport. I look forward to seeing the finished product during my next visit. Security queues were a 5 --- not super long but not the most efficient."}
{"text":"I wish more direct (cheap!) flights flew to PIT from DCA. While the 4.5 hour drive isn't too bad, it would be much more convenient if, say Southwest, flew from DCA to PIT. Oh well......  I actually remember the old Pittsburgh airport. I've done a ton of flying out of both the old and this new(er) version and the new(er) version is a complete improvement. Still, I wish the food options were more plentiful, open later, and spread more equally throughout the concourses. Security here is relatively tame (line speaking) when compared to more heavily traveled airports. PIT is no longer a HUB so it sees much less traffic these days. It's easy to navigate, there are no insanely long walks to terminals (I'm looking at you DCA!), and it's, relatively, clean. Moving walkways are always good, I never find this airport crowded, and if you forget reading material for your flight (I'm very guilty of this), there are abundant outposts to grab media to read. I appreciate there is free drop-off parking if you're there less than an hour since I and my brother semi-frequently fly here to visit my parents and need dropped off after. I know my parents, as Pittsburgh residents, wish there were more direct flights out of PIT. Even my brother, flying home to Boston, recently had to connect from PIT to Newark (???) then to Boston-I'm not sure why they couldn't do a direct flight more than once a day (which is why he had to book connecting) for that. Staff is at least good with kids-I've flown numerous times as a minor (many, many moons ago) alone and I always had a good experience. My  parents say security is now quick, but they also fly pretty frequently and are pre-approved for TSA. Overall, I think the breadth of flights was better when Pittsburgh was still a HUB, but it (mostly) gets our divided (by distance) family to where we need to go so that's a plus still!"}
{"text":"Eh...there's no Starbucks. I need that when I travel. It is easy to navigate though. Whatever, I can't really give any airport a lot of stars. They're soul sucking places."}
{"text":"Beautiful airport with awesome staff!!! Great shops and restaurants, and the place makes flying not too much of a hassle. Very accommodating to my handicapped mom and they helped me out when I was a teenager flying alone for the first time!"}
{"text":"I fly in and out of Pittsburgh quite a bit and have always been impressed with the speed and efficiency of the Pittsburgh International Airport. Unbeknown to most, there is another security checkpoint upstairs that is always faster than the one on the ground level. The tram that takes you from security to the terminals is quick. Gate agents and other employees are nice enough, although I have not often had to deal with them because flights are on time (with American).   There are good food options in the small food court so you should be able to find what you need for a quick meal. If you want a sit down restaurant there are those as well. For cocktails, there is Martini's, which I have been to a couple of times--they also serve food.   I give it a four star because it could use a slight update, but other than that it is a wonderful airport."}
{"text":"This is an ok airport.  I have two issues with it.  First issue, if you return a rental car you walk into the terminal on the first floor.  The check-in is then on the third floor.  That would not be that bad except for the fact you then have to go to the second floor for security.  That is flawed planning at its finest.  Second issue, this is a pet peeve of mine, you have to take a train in order to get to your gate.  It is just something that annoys me.  Security can easily back up so check to see if the alternate security point on the third floor is open.  There are several food options in the food court area.  There is also a decent number of shops.  Having a Rite Aid in an airport is a great idea.  That is a big plus."}
{"text":"Love this clean friendly airport. Great shoppinh,clean restrooms and friendly workers. I love my local airport!"}
{"text":"Best airport ever.  (At my favorite city ever, no less.)  Free wi-fi internet, as it SHOULD be.  It has a frickin' mall inside.  'Nuff said.  Excellent, friendly people working at each store and restaurant, too.  Easy to get anywhere quickly due to every departure gate pretty much being in one place.  Great layout.    And it has a dinosaur skeleton.  Yeah, loving it."}
{"text":"Easy to get around in with transit trains to other terminal.  Not usually a problem checking in or getting through security.  Beautiful architecturally.  Easy to get into Pittsburgh & surrounding areas from the airport."}
{"text":"Easy to get in and out, free wi fi, easy to navigate.  If you haven't been here before, give yourself a little extra time to take the tram to the gates."}
{"text":"Pros: Incredibly easy to navigate...probably cause its so small. Seriously, if you get lost here, you haven't walked far enough as of yet...all spokes lead back to the middle,  its not that difficult. -Baggage claim is easy and hasn't as yet lost a bag for me. -Easy to circle the airport for pickups and drop offs without getting lost or confused. -Food availability is on the upswing and I love Mayorga's gourmet oatmeal for breakfast. -There is a gas station right on the edge of the airport if you forgot to fill up which is convenient.  Cons: Checkin is ridiculous most days, I once waited two hours to just drop my bag at United (why don't they have a lane dedicated to those who have already checked in, paid for bags and just need to drop off...because that would be too intelligent, United - I'm talking to you). -Security is often crazy long as well, especially in the mornings but it is at least organized which is more than I can say for several other airports. -Parking shuttles can take awhile so make sure you leave time for that or just use off-site parking."}
{"text":"Another great airport. First of all they have free WI-FI. You'll most likely run into me in the Airside Building which houses a good number of eateries and shopping stores. The mezzanine level also has a chapel and meditation room. If smoking relaxes you, you can patronize one of the bars which has a smoking section. Now if you need to take a shower, you are in luck.  Pittsburgh has an airport health club located on the lower level.  For $10 bucks, you can feel rejuvenated with a nice hot shower. Isn't that refreshing? ;)"}
{"text":"I don't know if I would consider myself a travel expert but I feel like I've been in my fair share of airports in recent years and to be honest there are very few that I feel are comparable to Pittsburgh International Airport.  I must travel at off peak times because I have never and I mean never waited in the security line longer than 10 minutes. And I feel like when I say 10 minutes I really mean 5. Usually there are 3 or 4 TSA officers there looking at boarding passes and IDs and then you move to approximately the same amount of luggage scanners. I will say if it took longer I'd be okay with that. I'd rather wait an extra 20 minutes and be safe then be rushed through and have someone bringing a bomb on my plane, But then again I get crazy about flying and instead of you judging me I'll just continue on.  One of my favorite things about the airport is the Air Mall. If you know me you know I love to spend money even when I don't have it. The Air Mall doesn't necessarily have too much that I would ever shop at normally, I just appreciate the layout and how it's access able to all gates. What I hate about most airports is how you'll be stuck at your gate which has nothings but a damn Hudson New stand and the next gate over has a Bojangles and Body Shop. I mean. Who wouldn't want to jump gates? Being able to truly walk through all terminals and gates make the waiting game bearable.   Some other pluses:  *Free Wifi- enough said. *I never feel like I'm waiting long for my bags, because I tend to always check a bag.  The biggest minus is how far it is from the city. But if you hit it right from the city you'll be there in 15-20 minutes. But  since I'm on the way to the airport from the city if you feel like picking me up in Mt. Washington on your way to your fabulous trip feel free to take me with you!"}
{"text":"Big, failry clean and empty. Easy to get everywhere. Formerly a US Airways hub. Great for the business traveler horrible for the local economy that was once very reliant on the now gone steel industry."}
{"text":"My flight from Indianapolis was massively delayed due to rain, and I had a stopover here on my way to LAX. Of course, I missed the second plane entirely.   The kind ladies working the counter had my friends and I booked for the next flight to Los Angeles, seemingly while we were stuck in Indiana, as they had it all worked out for everyone before we even got there with new boarding passes printed out and everything.   Just a quick call home that I was coming in on a later flight and I was on my way."}
{"text":"Very nice airport with a train to get you to and from the gate areas. Lots of palaces to eat and very clean. Friendly staff and I received good service in all areas."}
{"text":"best place to fly out of in the Ohio pa area. Always find cheapest flights here."}
{"text":"My old home base! PIT gets mad props on pretty much everything.  - Short security lines. Protip: there's an \"alternate checkpoint\" across from departures. Go through there - it's always shorter than the main line.  - Good shopping/food options. They've done a TON of renovations in the central concourse in the last year and it's pretty sweet now. The McDonald's line moves quickly, which is a boon when I want hash browns at 6:30am.  - Fun decor - the T. Rex from the Carnegie Science Center by the people mover is a personal favorite.  - Easy short term parking. You can actually walk someone to the security checkpoint to say goodbye! Drive past departures and take the left exit to the top of the parking garage. Cost is cheap, something like $1 for a half hour, and there are always spaces. Kind of a throwback to when air travel didn't suck!  - My one complaint is the location: PIT is about 25 miles to the west of actual Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It's an airport, nothing great about it. They are all mediocre. This ones smaller and more accessible than most international ones. Same annoyances as them all, the good experiences are only good because they are not bad. All in all, pretty painless. We still need to figure out a better system for security. I have TSA Pre-check and there is still a line, although shorter, a line none the less.  If We pay a service and have to be finger printed; I should be able to do cartwheels through security. Pretty good selection of places to eat, again, same as most airports but they do have pink berry, so there's that."}
{"text":"A shadow of what it used to be since USAir decided to not have one of its hubs there anymore, the Pittsburgh airport does all it needs to do well from a flying standpoint. I have never had a proble with flights in and out of this airport. The one difficulty is the shops close at 8 pm (or even 7 pm) which is early. Often times I have had to wait for a late flight and there is no shopping available. I think only McDonald's is open late. Beyond that, it serves its purpose."}
{"text":"I've always liked Pitt, more because it was my home airport for so long. And now, after years of flying through different airports, this one is a good one!  the airmall is nice if you have time to kill. You'd be surprised how many airports have NOTHING available for travelers.  Only complaint is that baggage claim is very slow. I'm sure it's due to staffing cuts and the crappy economy. But trust me, it can be much worse!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had no issues with this airport.  I got in and out quick and had no lines or waits.  The airport is easy to navigate and They have a Steeler store."}
{"text":"The X is not confusing. Once you exit the plane, proceed to the tram that will take you to baggage claim or the exit. When leaving PIT, check in, board the tram, and go to either area A, B, C, D.  The letters represent a section of the terminal, a section of the X. Once you get the hang of it, this is a simple airport. Easy to navigate and with lots of eatery options.  If you want a decent meal, head to the Hyatt...just be prepared to walk.  Yes...the terrible towels were everywhere during the 2009 Superbowl season.  Festive Airport for sure.   For your reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrible_Towel"}
{"text":"Update now that I have moved to the Pittsburgh area, Monroeville, to be exact, and work in Vandergrift.  I do still love the airport and its amenities per the previous review I wrote and can add two -- I like that you enter into a common area of the terminal then can proceed to one of the individual terminals, rather than having separate terminals from the get-go.  I also like a shuttle train that takes me to just one stop for all terminals.  However I have to knock it down one star because of location west of downtown.  Yes I totally realize that  airports across the country tend to be in the outlying portions of the metropolitan area.  But, for exactly that reason, I can't give the top 5 stars when it took me 2 hours vs 1 hour (non-traffic hours) to get to the airport from Vandergrift, PA leaving at 3:20pm on a Friday for a 6:10pm flight.    Eeks -- stop and go, mostly stop, through one tunnel, then another, then the bridge, then just traffic becuz by then it was 5pm nearer the airport.  The saving grace for me, the newbie who didn't know what Fridays were gonna be like getting to the airport, was that once arriving at the airport, parking near the terminal was easy, there were absolutely no lines to check my baggage, and the TSA line was minimal.  For that I am forever grateful but I don't think I'm up for a Friday evening flight again.  Instead, I'll opt for the first flight out on a Saturday or take a 1/2 day of vacation on a Friday."}
{"text":"There used to be a STAPLES here. How handy is that? Now it's some shop that sells PDAs. But there's a real drugstore (that sells toiletries, etc, not prescription drugs), which is practical and some shops and bars to waste time in besides.   Not that you'd need to. I used this airport a couple times a month for 4 years and not one, NOT ONE, delay. This airport has some sort of level 5 weather clearance or some such, which means plans can fly in and out in rain, sleet, snow, etc. Of course, if where you're going TO is a problem, there's not much they can do.   You know what they say, god speed. Also, there's public transportation that runs to downtown and Oakland - the PAT bus, that's Port Authority Transit, and it's easy, timely (tho' the ride itself is long - the airport is pretty far out of town), affordable and avoids the tunnel traffic that you'd probably have to sit in if you drove. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"What a great airport. Tons of shopping, places to eat, and little bits and pieces of Pittsburgh history sprinkled about. Baggage claim is a snap, rental cars are located right across from it.  Tip!   This airport has a kids port area where you can take your kids to play while they are waiting to board the plane."}
{"text":"This is an award winning airport with very weird processes. First, I got to the security line and an agent told me to get out of the line and instructed me to the \"alternate\" security line. She did not give clear directions where that was because \"just up the escalators\" didn't cut it. You actually have to go back outside, cross the street and down some stairs into a modular security unit. This is also the same security line that the food service folks use, and they do not wait in the line so you are constantly being budged by grates of food that need to be scanned and employees that need to go through to the gates. This alternate checkpoint was not more efficient and I would have gotten to my gate faster if I hadn't been directed to get out of the first line.  Otherwise, the airport is clean. There are a few eateries but nothing too remarkable."}
{"text":"Loved this airport! Very Eco-friendly and my favorite part was they had a service dog relief center. A giant room just for your dog to go to the bathroom, and it was surprisingly clean! If I ever needed a connecting flight again I would deff try and fly through this location specifically for that feature. Oh and the shops- Armani, Lacoste, Furla, and brooks brothers! Just to name a few"}
{"text":"This airport, over-all, does it job and does it well with a little character too. I've gone in and out quite awhile now but what I miss the most is the perplexing but hilarous succession of the dinosaur/george washington/steelers player statues. It was like a bizarre yet probably accurate history of Pittsburgh.   The \"X\" layout is convenient once you're past security. It's nice that the food and shops are centralized, especially when I run into friends at the airport. Even though our flights are in different terminals we can still chit-chat over qdoba or coffee. However, I think that taking a tram just to from security to your gate is a little unnecessary and serves as a quick fix, not a real solution.  Security usually takes awhile too, since everyone is checking at security in the same location (as opposed to larger airports with multiple entryways). In fact, I've never had a \"speedy\" experience here.  All in all, great choices of food in the middle of the X (like Ben and Jerry's) and who can argue against free Wi-Fi? My only other complaints are that I wish the three AmericanAirlines gates didn't have to be all the way at the end of terminal D... always such a walk that I have to look forward to, and secondly it'd be nice if the 28X arrived/departed more frequently.  Oh random, but I also like the news ticker thingy."}
{"text":"This is a very nice airport, It's easy to navigate, there are lots of signs, and it's always been really clean.    The security is slow and any time I have ever been there I have had to wait a long time to get through.  They do have an alternate security section, but that too is usually busy.  This explains my 4 star review as opposed to a 5 star.  Once in the airport they have a lot of choices for eating, whether fast food or sit-down, chain restaurants or local, the options are endless. I actually would rate this airport based on selection of eateries, one of the better airports I've been to. The shopping selections are very diverse as well, you can shop for almost anything you're looking for.  They also have a kids play area, a place to get a quick manicure, pedicure, and/or massage, a club (at a fee or free with certain credit card memberships), and electronics charging stations.   Overall, This is a great airport with tons of amenities and in my experience staff has always been friendly."}
{"text":"A reasonably good Airport.   Overall, it's one of the better airports we have been to, given the \"X\" shape it has, with a bunch of kiosks in the center. Getting through the baggage exam area is about as much fun as it is in other places, but usually doesn't take too terribly long. Parking isn't cheap, but it's not totally ridiculous either. The long-term parking option is actually great, and the bus drivers we've met were extremely helpful and friendly the last time we traveled.  It would be wonderful if there were a rapid transit system to get from Dahntahn to the airport, and skin all the traffic through the tunnel and parkway. It's a little rough to get to unless you live on the South Side, and a damn cab ride costs an arm and a leg from the Highland Park area...  Extra star for having a freaking dinosaur greet you when you get off the tram. Our little one loves that thing; we have to go pay homage every time we fly in or out of PGH! Drop a few bucks in the hopper - it's for a good cause (the Carnegie museums...)"}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised at how great this airport is every time I use it. The layout is efficient with the central hub-style setup and only one shuttle stop, there are lots of food and shopping establishments, and the people who work here are friendly and do their jobs with a smile. For a city of this size, this airport is really impressive. No wonder it won best airport 2017!"}
{"text":"Not the nicest of airports and not a lot of things in it (restaurants, shops, etc). The security screening line was very long and moved slow, to the point I almost missed my flight. Also, they use a train system for getting to your terminal and what-not. I just hate that. Wasn't terrible, but wasn't great."}
{"text":"I like to travel and my family all lives down South so I fly pretty regularly. I've been to some TINY airports (Branson MO) and some bigger airports (Chicago) and compared to all of those I feel like our airport is pretty high if ranking cleanliness, passenger friendly, and on time flights. Pittsburgh is constantly updating the airport to make it more passenger friendly.  Once you make it through security there are some great shops to check out as well as a restaurant owned by a well known chef. Years ago you could come eat, shop, and let your kids watch the planes come in and go out. I wish that were still the case but not after 9/11.  The airlines are always adding more flights. Now there is one that goes straight to Paris. (HINT HINT to my hubby if he's reading this).  I'm thankful to live in a city that has a major airport. My family has to drive 3 to 4 hours to get to one. It really makes for a long travel day.  The only thing I would like to see changed is the security checkpoint. I think they need more lanes open. I would also suggest a separate lane for business travelers so they don't have to wait on the families who are headed on vacation.  But take note of the tip I posted. It tends to save time.  Happy travels!!"}
{"text":"Wha? Why is there a Nine West in the airport? Is that a Gap? TGI Fridays? Cheese fries?   A strange collision of chain retailers and flying the friendly skies, the Pittsburgh airport has a smattering of places to entertain yourself during your layover. A bit more entertaining than going into those Hudson News spots that seem to be in every US airport and buying Chex Mix for three dollars.   This midsized airport is easy to get around, and it gets extra credit for the entertainment factor. The architecture is a bit throwback but definitely still functional."}
{"text":"Got stuck here at 7, and all the resturaunts were closed. I've been here for 3 hours and haven't eaten all day. This is nonsense. Why would every business at an international airport close at 7?"}
{"text":"Back in the day, this used to be a really busy airport. US Airways used it as a hub, shops popped up during one of the many remodels, and it was a pretty handy airport to use.   These days the airport sees a lot less traffic, but it's still in pretty good shape. I rarely see many people in the airport, and I only saw two other aircraft on the group when I was there last time. If you have a choice and are going near PIT, you'll find this airport easy to get around and avoid a lot of people."}
{"text":"No real gripes other than parking long term is $14 a day. You get funneled into one security area, but it moves fast then have to take a ride to get to your concourse. Restaurant options are okay."}
{"text":"A pretty solid airport overall...let's pro and con it, shall we?  Pros: -Easy in, easy out - especially if you're being dropped off by a cab/shuttle/friend -Tile in the mail corridor. This may sound funny, but it's much easier to roll your (heavy) bags on tile than on carpet.  -Varied food choices, all conveniently located in the center-ish area of the airport -Clear and legible signs throughout -Clean bathrooms  Cons: -Security lines can be quite long if you're here during peak days/times. Duh. Plan accordingly.  -Very few power outlets. Maybe I missed a bank of charging stations, but I had a hell of a time finding a fairly convenient place to power up my phone.  -Shuttle trams. Meh. I could do without them. While I haven't seen an aerial shot of the airport, I can't believe it's oh-so-giant that trams are absolutely necessary. But hey, at least they move fairly quickly.   Smell ya later, Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The Pittsburgh airport is beautifully arranged.  You can enjoy high end shopping, wonderful dining and drinking options, and friendly staff.  Even the TSA I have encountered have been friendly.  They have fun set-up's inside like the Mr. Rodgers Neighborhood set, dinosaur bones, sports memorabilia, Andy Warhol facts/prints, and more!"}
{"text":"I've flown out of Pittsburgh between New York and California fairly regularly for nearly a decade and I have to say that it's truly one of the best airports stateside.   Although it's apparent size is deceptive--it's much larger than it might appear to a transferring traveler--it's fairly easy to navigate, and the people movers, which whiz past the shops were a life saver back when I was traveling with a 30 lb. backpack with my laptop, plus a 10 lb. cat carrier with a yowling cat in it.   And THAT's another treat worth mentioning. The shopping is some of the best shopping I've seen in an American international airport. Apparently, the mall is run by Heathrow Airport in London, a place where they take their shopping very seriously, and it shows. This is the place to find really beautiful high end leather business cases for men and women, great jewelry, perfumes, and other luxury and business-related items, and are much more abundant and attractively displayed than I usually see at U.S. airports. I always vowed to do some of my Christmas shopping there, but somehow it just never happened.  At the very least, the shops are a pleasant way to kill time. And Pittsburgh also has some of the best selections of restaurants and fast food outlets I've ever seen, which is great because I'm a vegetarian and I can be challenging finding restaurants in airports that cater to my taste & my budget outside of the really pricey sit down places.  My only complaint is that some of the airport staff leave something to be desired. On one occasion, when I was traveling with a woman who had MS and walked with a crutch, we were scrambling to catch a connecting flight. The airline had failed to have a wheel chair waiting as we had earlier requested. When an airport employee drove by on her little motorized cart, we asked if she would give our friend a ride, but the woman yelled \"I'm sorry Ma'am, but I'm going on my break right now.\"   Gee, thanks. My only consolation is the magical belief that she's probably bound straight to purgatory for that one. I say, \"magical\" because I wasn't raised a Catholic, but often hope that their notions of hell and purgatory really do apply.  Other than that, the only other annoying thing was the 2 times I've had to stand in a freezing outdoor area on the painfully noisy tarmack waiting to board my US Air flight in the midst of a sleet storm. Gee, if I had known I was going to do that, I would have brought my safety earmuffs and worn my 20-below parka.   Those three incidents aside, I've looked forward to flying through Pittsburgh over other airports like Philadelphia because it's a much more comfortable and easily navigable airport than so many others."}
{"text":"Nice airport. Very nice. Quaint. Unfortunately, it gets a two star rating as a result of its super inefficient baggage claim operations. There's really no excuse, no matter how poor it is, to make arriving passengers wait longer than 15 minutes for luggage. The airport is not that large. And in 2015 when they reduce their gate fees, there will be an influx  of direct international flights. So take note airport authority, get the proper resources in place to be more effective with baggage delivery to wary travelers. Besides, you want travelers to come to Pitts and to like it. Help set the first impression and for the regulars, make them feel glad to be back."}
{"text":"Average airport. Pretty old, not much here or options. Only have a US airways club which is no longer star alliance so if your with anyone else doesn't help.   The security lines are very fast IF your a premium member of an airline. If not. It takes forever. Unless your traveling at an off time.   The good thing here is that it's easy to get around and people are nice."}
{"text":"I recently traveled to LA by way of Houston and Cleveland. These experiences have made me realize how awesome the Pittsburgh International Airport truly is. There is a broad array of restaurants and stores (many of which are clustered in a central core). In addition, they offer FREE Wi-Fi AND original artwork from Andy Warhol. It is unfortunate that you cannot get to too many places directly from the airport (whose acronym is, ironically enough, PIA), BUT, if you're going to be stuck somewhere during a delay, it's a pretty cool place to be."}
{"text":"I've been to many airports, and this is one of the better ones.  Why?  First off, the food court/airmall is in the center.  You can get to it from any terminal without getting on a tram.  It is like a hub with each terminal hanging off it like spokes.  This section has been recently redone and looks nice.  Each terminal also has plenty of food places and shops so you don't have to walk to the center airmall if you don't want to. The prices are comparable to local stores (I think there is an ordinance that requires it.)  Each terminal also has moving side walks, and the parking is plentiful.  I've never had a problem with parking and never felt the need to take the parking shuttle.  There is a long interior corridor with a moving side walk that extends well into the parking lot. Baggage claim is also quick. Frequently my bag is already at the carousel by the time I get there.  Finally, there are two Starbucks - one on each side of security.  As a bonus, there is also an on-sight hotel.  I've never stayed there but it must be convenient if you're in for a quick business trip."}
{"text":"I am please with how fast I got past tsa and how friendly everyone was as always with this lovely airport!"}
{"text":"It's bigger than I expected. TSA is pretty quick here, but there's a bit of a walk (and rail ride) to get to the terminal.  Overall, if you're on a layover at this airport, you have plenty of food and gift shopping options."}
{"text":"Great airport! Very accessible from all long term and short term parking lots. Very clean. Baggage claim area is big enough where your not running into other people"}
{"text":"I end up at Pittsburgh International Airport at least twice a year. This airport has plenty of shops and restaurants beyond the checkpoint and a few on the public side. It has dine in restaurants and grab and go spots. It is well lit, nice moving walkways, clean, and majority of the time friendly. There is a free wi-fi connection which some times doesn't work, but most of the time does.   Watch out for the security check point. Pittsburgh International has one major security check point and when it gets busy it will back up. There is an alternative one that they only recently used, but it also gets backed up and is a bit of a walk to get to. Make sure if you are leaving out of Pittsburgh that you give yourself plenty of time.   The parking is great. Wide, open lots that offer plenty of parking fairly close to the terminal entrance. The baggage claim area is divided in a way that it cuts down on congestion fairly efficiently."}
{"text":"I was greatly surprised by the airport. it is one of three that I've seen with a mall in them middle of it.  The Airport is clean and modern, with a T-rex statue that gathers coins for the museum and terrorizes tourists by menacing over the shuttle arrival area. :)   There was no rush for anything, the TSA was very organized, friendly and capable of everything. The lines ran smoothly and everyone was friendly. I was able to arrive and get to where I needed to without any hassle at all.   I really thought they have a beautiful thing here."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh International.  Fancier than I thought it would be.  There are a few duty free shops, but other than that, the airport gave an old/rundown vibe to me.  Not very many charging areas.  Security wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I actually do love PIT, but it's a shame that the place is so empty these days!! I've heard many stories about the PGH city taxes, and USAirways pulling out most of their routes. I also hear that SW is going to be pulling many flights soon as well.  The airport itself is great- there's a GNC, O'Charley's Steaks, and many great places to shop and kill time between flights. The whole place is very well-lit, clean, and upbeat. Also, there are a ton of TSA lines and barely anyone going through them, so it's usually a breeze! I wish PHL was as easy to navigate as this airport. The only drawback is that this place is a ghost-town and many PHL-PIT flights are often full or oversold. However, it's still a winner in my books."}
{"text":"What a sad, sad airport. I landed and looked at the flight info screens...80% of which were dark. Apparently when US Airways pulled out of PIT it took its soul with it. Water stained drop ceiling tiles, crappy carpet circa 1985, and practically no one in the joint. However, this also means very short security lines! There is also a convenient rental car/taxi area near baggage claim.  It really is like getting a free trip via time machine to the mid-1980s. I can't blame the airport operators though; not many airlines fly in or out so why dump cash into the place?"}
{"text":"Always good to be home!  One of the easiest in and out airports I know. Tons of shopping and eateries in the.departure terminal.  A+"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is definitely an older airport compared to some of the others across the nation, but it does have everything that is needed to have an acceptable airport.  It has never severed me too wrong, and I have never had a completely unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"I don't like airports in general. I just want to get to where I'm headed, y'know? But the Pittsburgh airport, which was my home airport for the past three years, made traveling relatively painless.  One time it turned out that a friend and I were flying out the same day to different destinations and on different airlines, and because all the airlines are connected, we could hang out before boarding time. We couldn't have done this if we had been at a larger airport.  The food court's got some decent options. My favorite may be Currito, the burrito place where you can some healthy-ish grub. As for the other shops, the Rite Aid is always handy, and I've enjoyed getting my free monthly piece of chocolate at the Godiva store as a Godiva Rewards Club member. (The program's free by the way--if you fly in and out of PIT regularly, you might want to consider getting in on this.) You can also admire the Mister Rogers exhibit and various Pittsburgh-themed statues.  My least favorite thing is that the airport is a ways out from Pittsburgh proper, but that can't be helped considering how hilly Pittsburgh is. If you have friends picking you up, short-term parking is very, very inexpensive ($1 for less than a hour, last I checked?). Parking for longer periods of time is affordable, too. The 28X bus is a long ride back to Pittsburgh, but it IS a free ride if you have a Pitt or CMU ID.  I probably won't be flying in and out of PIT for the foreseeable future, but we had some good times together."}
{"text":"Nice airport with pretty good shopping.  Only down fall is the amount of flights that are available.  Wish there was more."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's airport is a lot like the city itself - people aren't all \"OMG, we need to go to Pittsburgh next year instead of Paris\" but once you're there, you realize \"hey, this is pretty nice, I kind of like it here\".   It's a surprisingly large airport for a smaller market and has a train that you have to take from the gates to the baggage claim area. In the gate areas, there are lots of places to shop or get something to eat. The bathrooms were clean, as were the gate areas that I saw.  Two things I'm not a huge fan of - big bottlenecks getting off the train (ONE escalator going down to baggage, really?) and the pickup/rental/parking complex is pretty confusing if you aren't used to it."}
{"text":"This airport is just fun to be at. They've got a lot of history of the city decorating the halls of this airport."}
{"text":"5 stars and an AMEN for free wireless. (and easy to find and procure outlets)"}
{"text":"PIT, my hometown airport.    GENERAL ACCESS:  Crazy easy - nothing like Chicago, NYC or Philly.  PIT is an airport in a  really big field.  PARKING: is not the greatest, short term is so expensive that it is almost always 1/2 empty.  Long Term is usually tight and I would argue that part of Long Term is really EXTENDED Long Term, but no one wants my opinion, just my parking $$$.  Extended Long Term is pretty vast and has shelters and shuttle bus service - nice, but can add a lot to your entry time.  SECURITY:  Two check points, upstairs and downstairs - moves pretty well.  PEOPLE MOVER:  Only way to the terminal - never had an unplanned wait.  Up the escalators to the central \"mall\" area  MALL / SHOPPING / EATS:  Everything from Harley Davidson to Brighton to the Drug Store.  Of course, news stand, luggage, phone accessories, fast food, slow food and alcohol.  TERMINALS:  (4) majors that branch off the mall - Restrooms everywhere, WIFI, ample seating and people movers.  Wish we were a hub, but maybe one day will be again.  Love my PIT!  Oh yes!:  Thank you to the person that found my jacket and took it to lost and found - much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Look out for the life-size statue depicting Franco Harris' immaculate reception near the ticketing area."}
{"text":"28x bus  $3.75 to downtown $40-50 Taxi Works if not in super big hurry No train to city"}
{"text":"There's nothing more American than putting a mall in the airport.  Because of this and many other reasons, I love Pittsburgh International Airport, and this from someone that doesn't really much like flying U.S. Air, because this is a U.S. Air hub.   Many a time I had to fly through here on my way from John Wayne to Providence, and many a time I enjoyed a Guinness at the TGIF's, or checking out the mall for stuff I ain't got (seriously, who NEEDS to shop at a mall, anyways?).  You never got the idea that you were actually IN Pittsburgh (I hear it's a nice town, but I've never stepped outside of the airport), and the place is like a chair you can stretch out in -- comfortable, but not too bug."}
{"text":"Now that the major construction projects and renovations have been finished, this is actually a pretty nice airport. The hub-spoke model is simple to navigate, there are some decent places to shop and the Rite Aid is very convenient for those of us pressed for time to pack. There are plenty of airports I try to avoid, but this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I like this airport.  Everything was centralized in a large hub, with several decent food options!"}
{"text":"Great Airport, nice layout, friendly employees, extensive food & shopping options. It was a great experience coming in and out of this airport especially since I was traveling from New York and Laguardia Airport is a complete mess. This was my first time traveling to Pittsburgh and I loved the airport and the city."}
{"text":"favorite airport ever. (i've only been in 4 or 5...so...anyway).  It's SUPER easy to maneuver. Security is always super super fast. i've never stood in a long line here, ever. maybe i'm just lucky? and they're NICE. love it.  there's a train that takes you to the terminals from the security line and you go up an escalator and there you go...every gate at your finger tips. no running around or trying to find what end of a massive airport you need to be in. The X layout with the center hub is fantastic. most of the stores are located in the middle. sort of sad qdoba isn't there anymore. but life goes on.   the easiest airport experiences i've had are all here."}
{"text":"Okay I was pissed that I couldn't get on an earlier flight back to SF from Pittsburgh but I guess I should give a one star review to Delta Airlines! So here I was - stuck in the Pittsburgh airport for 3 1/2 hours and because I drank way too many margaritas the night before drinking in the airport bars was a distant thought. I didn't want to drink anymore coffee or was really tired of reading about Paris' in jail conflict in every periodical I picked up so I'm walking around and stumbled upon some boutiques - I really appreciated being a girl at this moment - Nine West Shoes, Body Shop, Clinique cosemetics and the mother of all things Pink and Girly - a Victoria Secret's shop! The girls there were friendlier than most of the shops here in SF and so helpful too! I easily spent 2 hours here and managed to spend less than $50! Thanks Pittsburgh airport I hope to come here again for \"business trips!\""}
{"text":"I have had good experiences with this airport.  Fast, efficient, quick lines at security, no delays.  I did have a little...I guess you would call it a gaff?  I noticed a service outlet of a company that the company I work for had purchased a month before.  I was chatting with the manager about the business and how they operate (I'm an operations guy, can't help it) and I mentioned that I thought they were a savvy strategic purchase.  This led to lots of questions by the employee.  Turns out they hadn't been informed they were sold.  Oops.  Awkward.  Shouldn't these things be communicated down to the troops?"}
{"text":"For a hub and spoke-style airport, this one is surprisingly not annoying. Everything is signed and you can get around pretty easily. There's lots of shopping options, which is surprising given the location. There's also some good restaurants and enough of them that they don't seem overcrowded. You do need to be prepared to walk, though. Since there's only four \"spokes,\" if you're at the end of one of those spokes you'll be walkin' for quite a  while.  Bathrooms were all clean, neat, and orderly. Always a positive in an airport.  Getting in and out is pretty easy, and I didn't have any problems with security. It wasn't the fastest security I've gone through, but it didn't take me longer than 20-ish minutes.  I wouldn't go out of my way to layover here, but I wouldn't mind a layover here. Besides, there's a giant dinosaur you can gawk at. That's good for killing at least ten minutes!"}
{"text":"Excellent kids area & food options but don't fall for the diner... not fresh real potatoes & corn syrup for pancakes. TSA is on the ball... every detail according to the rules."}
{"text":"Outdated airport in a state of disrepair. Everything is outdated. Also all the bars close at 9 pm. So avoid any late flights or lay overs. Small airport for the size of the city I thought. Reminds me of the old dtw."}
{"text":"Overall an A+ airport. We fly in and out of here a few times per year. Coming into the airport, all roads and parking areas are well labeled and easy to access. Parking rates are reasonable for short, long term, and extended parking.   The airport overall is specious with a lot of windows. Signs are large and it's easy to navigate.   Spacious terminal, good selection of stores, sit down restaurants, and quick stop food options.   And... there's a t-rex skeleton. Nothing beats that!"}
{"text":"No complaints. Security was easy to get through, and it's not too hard to navigate.   I didn't realize that this was the home of Mister Rogers, and they had a bunch of his memorabilia everywhere. This is why I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This is a great regional airport with international connections.  Drop off and pickup very quick.  Pickup -- you cannot wait for more than a few minutes before having to circle the lot and come back in but if you do it slowly each circle is about 5 minutes... Was there just a few days ago as the PGA folk were coming in -- lots of traffic.  Parking lots easily accessible.  They have a cell phone lot that is free for the first hour so you can arrive early; stop there and await a call for a pickup -- then 5 minutes later you are there.    Great access from 376 and/or 79."}
{"text":"As I travel all around for business I am in and out of airports throughout the year. This is one of the few that I find easy to maneuver around. It is fairly large, and clean. Rental car area is a quick walk to close by and cars are on-site. Baggage claim is average. As with most airports it's hit or miss concerning wait time.  Still, it is kind of always empty in a strange Stephen King novel kind of way. Every time I have been here it seems as if this airport is on the verge of shutting down for lack of business. Kind of weird.  There is actually a decent amount of the normal newsstand/bookstores, shops, and dining options at this airport. Free wifi is a bonus.   From the NYC area it is a quick flight from LaGuardia or JFK on US Air, JetBlue, or Delta."}
{"text":"Not a bad airport.  It's clean, functional, easy to find your way around with signs big enough to read from a distance.  What I like best about PIT is that no matter where your flight is headed, you never have to walk far from one gate to another.  That's a bonus when you have a tight connection and a carry on with no wheels. (does anyone have those anymore?).  Security was efficient and pleasant, almost like they actually saw everyone as a person and not as job.  The shops and restaurants in the airport are a good mix of retail so there's something for everyone.  The one not-so-good aspect, if your flight is later in the evening (after 7 or 8), then quite a few of the shops and restaurants will be closed, leaving you with few options to wile away the time."}
{"text":"I don't usually review airports but as I stood in the TSA line yesterday thinking these folks are pretty nice, I realized I should write a review.   There's a shuttle, like a tram, monorail that goes between the airport and the terminal. TSA here is really efficient. When you arrive in PIT it is well signed to find your way out, to The Taxi Stand or Uber Stand or Baggage Claim or wherever. When you're departing once you get off the monorail there's a small shopping area with some interesting shops to roam around in if you have time.  It's a short walk to your gates and each terminal isn't 30 gates long.    It's a good set up for departing travelers and you can easily take advantage of this food court and shopping area despite what terminal your gate is at."}
{"text":"I love our small to medium sized International Airport. The shopping is delightful and they should open it more often to the public. Unfortunately it is only available once you clear security or deplane. They do open it a couple of times a year at the holidays, but it isn't widely known. While the construction going on is inconvenient, such is the price of progress. It used to be a major hub, and the powers that be are working to that end once more. Jet Blue and Southwest are my favorite airlines here. Allegient is coming in Feb 2015 which will be great for the frugal travelers. Pittsburgh needs to continue it's business growth, however, and tourism trade by having more direct flights to major cities."}
{"text":"I've only been through PIT once and it was easy to navigate coming and going to the airport plus inside. It was clean and had lots of options for food. Security was quick and painless as much as it can be."}
{"text":"United doesn't update their contact boards for Canadian flights, and there is almost never anyone at the courtesy desks, meaning you have to call the courtesy line to check your flight status constantly. On top of that, although this isn't PITs fault, the TSA agents are super unhelpful and rude to approach."}
{"text":"Not too shabby, Pittsburgh! For a smallish airport with just one main terminal, I thought Pittsburgh International had a pretty nice array of shops and quick serve dining options.   After an unexpected traffic-free drive to the airport last Friday morning, I found myself with loads of time to kill. I was happy to see a coffee counter with decent coffee and several places that were serving breakfast. I opted for a breakfast burrito from Currito which was quite delicious, even if the employees were determined to move at a snail's pace.   I definitely spotted a Rite Aid as well, which I've definitely never seen in any other airport. Two thumbs up for that."}
{"text":"Being stuck at any airport overnight is a real drag.   Being stuck in Pittsburgh airport is probably even worse. What with the weather and flight delays, plenty of people here with no places to eat or drink. Stores and restaurants in the concourse close at 815 or so. Even the Chairmans' Club is dormant by 8:15 PM. Talk about tough times. Place has changed lots based upon what I hear from locals, never fully recovered or the same after US Airways pulled their hub away. Not really convenient what with no subway or rail transit system for the masses. The city itself has poor urban infrastructure planning in terms of highway  accessibility transits and things to do after work. They could so much better to make it a better overall experience for traveler."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this airport. Is this wrong?   Reasons why: 1. Free WiFi 2. I love riding the tram! 3. The statues of Franco Harris and George Washington that greet me when I arrive. (Sums up Pittsburgh nicely) There's also a dinosaur one as well. 3. The shops - Gaps, Victoria's Secret, Nine West, more than enough to keep me entertained before a flight.  4. You are free to move around and are not restricted to one terminal since you go through security before you ride the tram. This is what I hate about most airports since food choices are so limited in the terminal I happen to be in. 5. The food court is huge and has several food options, plus the terminals have some food options as well."}
{"text":"This airport seems to be quite the odd duck when it comes to Airports. Besides from the dinosaur and various levels that lead you to alternate security checks the wifi is complete crap. The wifi actually doesn't work on Apple products so every time I end up in Western PA i don't get wifi at the airport"}
{"text":"Leaving, was ok...waiting area was very small for our flight. check in was easy, getting through security was a breeze. Bathrooms were nice, wifi wouldn't work  O when we were waiting for out flight we got their 2 hours earily like the planes tell you too.... their was a flight leaving at that moment, and they kept paging for a party of 2...no one showed so they locked up as the plane was getting ready to taxi away. This Larry the cable guy comes RUNNING along saying where the f are they I still have 2 minutes plane doesnt leave till 218 its 216 wtf,  He was just going off! starts yelling at some cleaning guy to get someone on the phone. after like 30 minuets and 3 people telling him its to late,,,he finally takes off. THEY TELL YOU TO GET THEIR EARLY THEY BOARD 10 before they take off! As he was arguing the plane taxid away and he was telling them to turn it around and pick him up! well they bump him to the second flight my flight. And we board the plane we all sit down. And just as they close the doors to take off he comes pushing in! HE WAS THE LAST ONE ON! HE ALMOST MISSED HIS SECOND FLIGHT!!! It was larry the cable guys ugly bastard brother taking his kid to his ex wife, no wonder hes divorced DUMB AS ROCKS!  O and the kicker...he sat right infront of us! bitching about the air plane company IT WAS HIS FAULT!"}
{"text":"Pre Check is coming!!!  Fortunately, The TSA seems to watch the Sky Priority lane. They pulled us through the metal detector and allowed us to skip the high dose of radiation from the body scanner."}
{"text":"For anyone who typically flies more than a handful of times per year, it's probably best to just accept any quirks your home airport has and get used to them. Embrace the bad with the good and it'll make the experience as smooth as possible. PIT is my home airport; however, there's not a lot that I've had to overlook. Although there are just a couple things I had to get used to and had to embrace.   The cons- really only two come to mind. The first being how inconsistent wait times through security (and to a lesser degree, the ticketing counters) can be. Sometimes 10 minutes, sometimes an hour plus. Others have mentioned the alternate check point at PIT (only available certain hours) which has served me well at times, but it was there where I experienced my longest wait time at PIT ever at 1 hr 30 mins. The second con for me is baggage claim. It's easy enough to get there and navigate, but it seems to take longer here than many others. I plan on 30 minutes after landing now and will usually take my time to grab something to eat before I try to retrieve my luggage.   The pros- easy to get to with predictable drive times. There are plenty of amenities for an airport with the amount of traffic it gets, both eating and shopping. PIT has a simple design, is easy to get around, and never feels crowded (some call it a ghost town).   All things considered, I think PIT is a good model for what an airport should be. And if you ever have the option between choosing PIT or CLE, do yourself a favor and avoid the \"mistake by the lake\"."}
{"text":"One of the more perplexing airports i've been in. For some reason, you always have to take a tram to get to the gates and/or back to baggage claim check-in. I wonder what exists between the two..."}
{"text":"It's home base. Free wifi, good shops, plenty of restaurants, not too stuffy, and you can still get a good chair massage."}
{"text":"I've flown to and from PIT several times over the last four years and although it has shown some improvement over the years, it's still kind of a dull airport to be honest. Actually, it is super dull, almost depressing, and not nearly as lively as most other airports I've flown to and from. Wish PIT had better food and shopping options. Maybe it needs some renovating too. I understand that it's a smaller airport compared to many, but things can definitely be done to the interior."}
{"text":"When we come in to visit Joe's family. This is where we fly into. Its like it's own mini mall and super clean. i have no issues flying here and hanging out. Very cool."}
{"text":"This airport is huuuuuge, like the size of a massive mall with tons and tons of shops and food. There's also a RiteAid to stock up on hangover cures! (Not that I'm speaking from experience or anything....) This is definitely one of the top 3 airports I've been to thus far. Only downside to an airport this size is the walking to get from gate to gate -- especilly when you're like me and don't trust the airport personnel not to lose your bag so you stuff all of your clothes and shoes into a backpack. You gotta lug that crap a long distance!   There's also some cool historical memorabilia and stuff that will educate you and make you seem so smart to all of your friends. I wouldn't mind flying into PIT again!"}
{"text":"As someone who travels at least 3~4 times per year, I have gone to this airport quite a bit. I really do like it, despite it being kinda ...old. It definitely needs a facelift or something. Architecturally, it's still kinda 70s ish maybe(?) and almost sort of minimalist but also kinda grungy looking and dirty. I know airports aren't usually targeted as \"glam\" spots but still....they could scrub the floors every so often. The bathrooms are hit or miss in terms of cleanliness.  The best part of this airport is that it's not really confusing to get around (in my opinion, as a former Pittsburgh resident) and there are decent places to eat and shop, although I am bummed about them not having Victoria's Secret anymore. They get points for Godiva though. My mom likes going to the Nine West and Clinique stores too. They also have a Swatch store if you like watches or just killing time chatting with the dudes who work there.  Also they have Auntie Ann's which is instawin in my BF's book."}
{"text":"I have zero complaints about this airport. It is really fantastic.  Pittsburgh International is very easy to navigate around. For a larger airport, the gates are set up in such a way as that all gates, no matter which airline you fly, are centrally located and extremely easy to get to. Sort of like a star pattern, with the main hub in the center.  I can't let this review go by without mentioning the way cool dinosaur skeleton that has been in this airport on loan for as long as I can remember. Good Ole T-Rex, very visible on your way down the escalators toward baggage claim.  There is a huge mall, yes, I said mall, with phenomenal stores located AFTER security in the main hub of the terminal. Pittsburgh has one of the first airports to recognize that folks would like more shopping options than a bottle of water, a cup of coffee and a magazine. Another plus is NO sales tax on clothing (Pennsylvania law)!  Rental cars located on-airport, and TSA PreCheck is in place! Love, love, love!!"}
{"text":"I've flown in and out of Pittsburgh International Airport many times, developing an appreciation for its high's and a disdain for it's lows.  On the plus side, both parking and rental car operations aren't needlessly complicated or difficult to find.  The terminals are clean and well-lit.  Food options are well ahead of the pack, and not necessarily overpriced.  Unless there is snow or ice, or your destination airport is slowed, they are pretty good about getting planes in the air within reasonable proximity of schedules.  WiFi is free, but isn't always working.  The downside is also long.  Movement between buildings is via a subway system which always seems to be slower than it should be, using the similar arrangement at Atlanta-Hartsfield as a point-of-reference.  Security layout is pitiful, concentrating all passengers to a single TSA area.  Once that area backs-up, the wait can be endless.  Unlike other newer airports which mix shops and restaurants between their airline gates, the walk to your gate is much longer than it should be.  One of my old coworkers described PIA as \"a shopping mall with an airport attached!\"  On balance, adequate as an airport, very good as a commercial or fast food destination and not one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I like this airport.  If Midway, in Chicago, was laid out this way, travel through that airport would be wonderful, but focus here, forget that nightmare.  You enter into the ticketing building, which also houses the security check area.  There were multiple lines open, each roped to keep you in an appropriate line, not like at Midway.  Once through security, its down to the tram, no long wait there, either.  The tram drops you in the terminal building.  Up the escalator, or elevator, to the central area of the terminal building.  The central area is filled with a varied selection of food items and retail. Of course, everything is NOT 24 hour.    Everything is well lit and clearly marked.  And you always have a sight line to toilet facilities. Off the core center there are 4 wings, each with 25 gates.  Walking distances are not extreme, so really, what more could you ask?"}
{"text":"Every alternate friday, this is my place. Great and cheap parking facilities.  Pretty small security line. Hardly I had to wait more than 15 minutes anytime.  Sometimes they even allow me in TSA pre-check. Wow! On top of it , they also have alternate security clearance point. Superb. Lots of shops to spend your time.  Overall , a wonderful airport aside of any commotions. Great going steelers :)"}
{"text":"The airport is usually very clean, security is quick and nice enough, and there is a good variety of bookstores, shops, and restaurants to choose from. I fly into this airport at least every three months and haven't had many issues with delayed flights or gate changes."}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe how far this airport has come over the last few years.  I love the fact that we now have a healthy options, and a variety of restaurants besides your run of the mill family feed bag. I even noticed that this airport has a lounge!!  Anyway in terms of security with it is really fast to get through. The alternate security checkpoint is pretty clutch (it also has TSA PreCheck to help you get through the line faster). I have also noticed that the TSA agents are actually more friendly than most airports I have been to.   When I go to this airport, I tend to park in the extended lot. Just make sure you text yourself the place where you parked so that when you return you will know where to head. One complaint I have to make is that I feel like the shuttles don't run often enough when picking up/dropping off. This can be kind of frustrating when it is very, cold outside.   Overall, I am pleased about the recent changes and totally expect to come back :-)"}
{"text":"Being a former Pittsburgher, I frequently use this airport which has many pluses that include extensive shopping, decent food options, as well as free WiFi.  If you are a USAirways Club member there is a great club for you to relax in while you wait for your departing flight.  This airport is spacious and nicely laid out with a great statue of Franco Harris making the famous Immaculate Reception, which can be seen when heading to the Tram.    So why only 4-stars and not 5?  It is because their baggage handlers must be on sedatives, as it takes about 30 - 45 minutes after landing to receive your bags!!!   I could understand this if PIT was a busy airport...but it is not!  When I land in the CLT, I consistently get my bags within 5 minutes of arriving at baggage claim.  TIP: If your final destination is PIT, do not check your bag...go carry-on only!"}
{"text":"Hello Pittsburgh International Airport! And Hello Review Number 800!  Things I LOVE about PIT:  - I go here to get out of Dodge.  I love to get out of Dodge.  - Security isn't as bad as other airports.  Believe me, I have traveled to some pretty obscure places.  Security here is a cake walk.  And don't complain about the TSA being slow.  Hello?  Look around.  It's people lunging all their belonging with them that is the problem.  Pick it up, people.  - Bar Symon.  When traveling in and out of PIT, I get to visit Bar Symon.  - You get to see cool things here, like a dead dinosaur and Franco Harris.  - Lots of shops, so you can pick up a replacement travel pillow for the one you left at home.  Plus there are more than a couple dozen other shops.  Add about a dozen quickie food & snack choices and a half dozen sit down spots.  Sounds good to me.      - It's not big enough to get lost in.  But you can still get in some imaginary exercise.  - You can learn extra stuff about Andy Warhol.  - There is a tribute to Mr. Rogers.  Everyone loves Mr. Rogers.  - Non stops flights.  Pittsburgh still has some.  Boston, Denver, St. Louis, Phoenix, Houston, Ft. Myers, San Fran, just to name a few.  Things I don't like about PIT?  Gee, I can't think of any.  Don't like this airport?  Let's see you try to run one any better."}
{"text":"Flying?  Dropping off?  Here are some tips and gripes about the Pittsburgh Airport. If delaying goodbyes or passing time waiting for arrivals,  the Hyatt has better food than city of bridges Cafe.  If you don't have status,  the alternative security line,  outside and across the street can be faster.  However,  if you do have preferred status,  just use main security area,  it's short,  and the alternative doesn't have a preferred line.  There is a free service if your car battery needs to be jumped.  However,  even though there are phones at each set of doors heading down the far corridor towards parking,  the list of emergency numbers are all rubbed off until you walk all the way back towards the ticketing area. Fun to discover at 1am. Not. Free WiFi available.   Get here early to get a massage near A2.  Walk around.  Play ingress.  I'd like to see more charging stations. There is natural lighting from the ceiling,  which is nice.  They are doing remodeling, and adding high end stores,  but it still looks dirty compared to other airports."}
{"text":"Small airport, so it's pretty quick to get in and out. Look for the T-Rex skeleton!"}
{"text":"PIT is my favorite airport. It has everything I need: free wifi, burritos, and a Swatch store. The TSA folks are usually pretty friendly too, which is rare, and when things are slow they may even joke around with you about the giant rain boots you're wearing on a sunny day.  It could use an update but really, I don't care much that the place is looking a bit rough because seeing it means I'm home.  Bonus fact: PIT has the only Swatch store in Pennsylvania."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh international is a smaller airport I would say. Maybe small is not the right word. Quiet maybe. Pittsburgh used to be a hub but after the fall of us air they have declined a bit. They try. Southwest has become a major carrier in and out (I don't mind they tend to be pretty cheap with lots of options that don't require layovers). It is usually easy in and out. Sometimes parking there can be tough. Parking far away...but overall it is okay and it is close to home so that is a nice thing."}
{"text":"This is the airport I always fly out of, as its closest to my home. As far as the amenities and interior goes, this airport has nearly everything you could think of. Designer shops, restaurants, etc. so if you have a lot of time to kill, there will be plenty to do so that you don't get bored. Like every other airport, prices are outrageous.   The airport is extremely big, much larger than many other international airports I've visited. You need to take a tram to the terminal, which is usually extremely crowded. Security lines are incredibly long. I spent over 45 minutes at the main security line, so yesterday I decided to use the alternate line. Don't do it. There were only 10 or so people ahead of me and the line was still as slow as molasses.   The bathrooms need serious updates, but the majority of the airport has gone a facelift in recent years. It's always pretty clean, and the staff is friendly. Even TSA is friendly.   Three stars for the size and amount of people. Very busy."}
{"text":"We were at the \"new\" Pittsburgh Airport on opening day a couple of decades ago, and I'm happy to see that it's still spiffy clean, fairly vibrant despite the turnover of several carriers, and features some of the amenities of better airports. It's still short on places to plug in (except at Southwest), the security lines are unfortunately centralized due to the airside/landside arrangement, and of course since 9/11 the once great Air Mall concept has been for travelers only (before, you could go out and just shop there without a boarding pass, and it was actually a reasonable sort of mini-mall with the guaranteed street pricing program they once had).   But, the airport's too far from downtown and the public / ground transportation isn't reliable at all (waited an hour and a half for the 28x bus, which is supposed to run on the half hour, and then had to suffer through many local stops before getting downtown). Until they put in a modern express rail line, this will consign PGH to being a second-rate airport on world standards, despite its pleasantness and general airiness.` At least you can get an Uber here pretty easily and relatively cheaply ($20 or so downtown)."}
{"text":"Really long line at TSA makes me unhappy camper."}
{"text":"Pros: many great airlines and destinations Cons: no easy public transportation available to take you from Pittsburgh to the airport, international arrivals leave much to be desired  I recently returned to Pittsburgh from overseas. We were forced to take a strange, circuitous route through dank, dark hallways. There was only ONE homeland security person available to check all of us (200+ passengers) through customs."}
{"text":"Basic inner city airport. What makes this one stands out is free wifi! yeah! that's the best thing."}
{"text":"I've been waiting 50 minutes for the parking shuttle. Avoid at all costs. Use offsite parking. This is bush league."}
{"text":"after visiting pittsburgh my entire childhood, then living there for five years, and still regularly visiting the steel city, PIA has always been one of my favorite airports. and i really don't feel that way because i'm biased. it's usually not that crowded (minus holidays of course), and if you're smart, they have two security checkpoints usually open (just follow the signs).  it's usually always comfortable and easy to get through, and barring flight delays (not faulting the airport), it's one of my favorite and easiest places to fly out of. so if you have a stop over there or have a chance to visit, don't fret. and if you have extra time, get dahntahn, watch the stillers, and get a primanti's sandwich."}
{"text":"Waiting for bags again for over 40 minutes. Not sure what goes into the airport of the year calculations but baggage time must not."}
{"text":"I have been through this airport several times and I have never experienced such terrible service. I am a college student and was booked under United to take a flight to Houston to go to Honduras. However due to the incompetence of the airport not having a backup crew, not only did they delay our flight 7 hours and told us to still come on time, they then cancelled our flight and could not fit us to another plane that would work with the schedule we had settled. Therefore we tried discussing this with the people that worked there but they merely brushed us off. Never had I experienced such horrible customer service where employees of a airport would treat us in that manner. Therefore we were unable to go on a trip that we worked a full year to prepare for. They also prevented us from helping families get the healthcare they needed. For this was the worse experience I ever had due to both the incompetence of the airline and the airport."}
{"text":"I came here on a business trip yesterday and am leaving today. This airport has many amenities. There are several interesting places to eat that offer a sit down meal. The architecture of the main terminal is attractive. I also like the diversity of flights from here especially since this is not a hub airport. I just a Delta flight boarding for Paris for example. Also the rental car facility is connected to the airport which is convenient. The airport is only about 20 miles from downtown which adds to its convenience.  I like this airport."}
{"text":"You tell me which other airport has statues of dinosaur skeletons AND Franco Harris?? This airport is definitely one of the best in the country. Here are a few reasons why:  Airport Website: Completely interactive and regularly updated. It even tells you about discount flights and what % of the parking lots are full. Nearly all your questions will always be answered.  Wireless: Not only is it here, it's FREE. Thank you!  Parking: People, there is NO need to pull over on the side of the highway while you wait for arrivals!! Short term parking is only $1 for the first hour - great if you are picking someone up. Extended rates are $6.75/day, and you are still actually leaving your car at the airport (instead of at an off-site location).  Security: One security check point. Yes, during peak travel the line can be long, but the TSA folks do a great job moving everyone through, and are generally pretty nice.  Layout: Passengers transported by shuttle between the security area and the terminals. No long walks, no confusion. There's basically one way in, and one way out, so you never feel like you're moving through the wrong way. Inside are four terminals to choose from and the signs are very clear. There are moving sidewalks to get you down through each terminal.   Mall: You'll find your basic airport food, but they do have some decent selection of shops which help pass the time (Victoria's Secret, Clinique, Eckerd, Sunglasses Hut, etc). There's even a place to get pedicures and massages!  Bathrooms: They do a pretty good job of keeping everything very clean. I still haven't had an \"ewww\" experience yet.  Baggage claim: Fast and simple. There's never any mystery about which terminal to go to... the areas are permanently split up by airline, and then the signs display the flight numbers.   I wish more airports in the country were as good as this one!!"}
{"text":"Nice airport with a shopping mall feel.  Now it just needs better stores for me to shop in.  They have the usual bookstores where you can buy souvenirs, magazines, and snacks.  Then it seems to skip the middleman and you get a couple of high end stores.  I don't know about everyone else, but I'm not about to go shopping for high end clothes at an airport.    Foodwise - You got your usual fast food restaurant chains like McDonald's and Subway but I really wanted to see more restaurants in here that represented Pittsburgh better.  Stick a Primanti Brothers in here and that'll shut me up.  Another complaint is the bathroom doors for the stalls in the girls bathroom.  It would be so much better if these opened outward instead of inward.  The stalls are small enough already, but when i dragged my carry-on in there with me, the doors were so hard to close.  Got me all frustrated."}
{"text":"A great airport but security can be a real nightmare! I've had the longest security wait times at this airport of my entire travel history! They clearly don't have the appropriate resources to cover the volume of travelers. They have opened up an additional screening area but frankly, when I tried that area it seemed just as bad as the main checkpoint."}
{"text":"We love this airport for it's clean, easy to use size.  There are lots of food choices once you pass security so make sure to eat after you get in or before you leave the secure area.  The restrooms and seating areas are always clean and airport staff is always helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh International airport is what I call a \"ghost town\" airport as compared to other major cities. It consists of a landside and airside terminal which is connected by two air trains.  They have Wi Fi but unfortunately it is of poor quality and I end up having to use my data plan. They do have a number of charging stations. Most of the shoppes are on the airside terminal which unfortunately you have to pass through security to get to.  When I fly, I normally take early flights and arrive sometimes to find that the carrier's station hasn't even opened yet. However, on the plus side I find I normally don't have a problem flying out of the airport on time.  Another perk is parking in that if use have a turnpike E-Z pass then you can use it to park in one of their 3 lots. There is no discount on parking but it saves you the trouble of having to get a ticket and pay it.  They do have a cell phone lot for arrivals but limited to an hour. On the air side terminal there is some renovation going on but they do have some grab and go food and some stores. I normally don't have time for these stores because I need to get to a gate.  At one time the airmall was a very nice place to visit but now since it is limited to passengers only I think it has gone downhill. There are nice shops there but I usually prefer to spend my money at my destination.  Still for being a small airport it has advantages of not overly long lines to get through security and if you check baggage then it doesn't take a whole lot of time to retrieve it. The airport is easy to get around so it has some things going for it."}
{"text":"Don't get fooled by the 70's-like architecture, a terminal carpet that must have seen generations of travelers, and the sound of \"International\" (I'm sure there WAS a time when this was a more accurate add-on to the title than it is now). Pittsburgh Airport is great because it is really laid back. Like, really.   Pros's:  - no people - never waited at security for more than 5 mins - you're at the gate within 10 minutes - no people  Con's:  - limited ground transportation options (bus that takes 45mins into Downtown with several stops or taxi with $40 as the only options) - flights are mostly domestic"}
{"text":"For my 700th review, I wanted to write about something really cool.  Then I looked and saw that I already had 714 reviews, so that was shot.  I should really keep better track.  Anyway, this is a very convenient and nice airport.  It's easy to get to (I always take the 28X bus from downtown) and it never seems crowded or frantic.  Security seems to move fast, even when it's busy.  The TSA workers are much nicer, friendlier (and better looking, woof!) than those at LaGuardia.   As a traveler, it's nice to see a friendly smile as I take my belt off....so I can go through the metal detector, of course.  The food court and shopping in the center hub of the airport is great. I love how they have a drug store...candy and water is so much cheaper than at the newsstands.  Plus, the Rite Aid has 5th Avenue candy bars, which I love but you can't find everywhere!  The staff there keeps the place very clean, the bathrooms are decent and there is plenty of signage to let you know where you're going.  I hate it when I have to leave Pittsburgh, but when I do have to go, I'm glad it's through such a nice airport.  (Also, I swear I wrote a review of this airport previously so if at some point I show two reviews for this place, then there's proof that this site is messing with my head)"}
{"text":"Been to many airports, but I can honestly say that this is one of the better ones.  I haven't had many delays here (knocks on wood) and the terminals are rarely crowded.  I wanted to rate it a 3 bc sometimes the parking shuttle takes forever but extended parking is only $8/day.  You can also just park closer to the terminal and walk.  I don't think it's too bad of a walk other than during winter time.  Security lines are not long other than at times during the summer and xmas, which is expected.  The extra security lanes on the other side also helps.  What takes long are the Airline Check-in counters bc not all airlines have the kiosk for check-in only passengers.    Luckily, they added curbside check-in and you can check-in and/or drop off luggage at the curb.  Note that with the convenience this provides, tips are appreciated.  They remodeled parts of the airport and added more shops as well."}
{"text":"Like many others have mentioned, the airport itself is very easy to navigate around. At first I was lost trying to get from extended parking to the actual parking, not knowing when the buses picked up because there was no signs. parking is also relatively cheaper then most other airports."}
{"text":"I will mirror what other passengers have said, I really like the centralized \"X\" design; it's surprisingly easy to get around, and I'm not running one big hallway (ahem, that means YOU Charlotte-Douglas).  I love love LOVE that they have a few Au Bon Pain's here at the airport.  I had a lovely proscuitto-egg bagel sandwich for breakfast, very tasty.  The shopping options are also excellent.  I think I saw a Victoria's Secret, Brookstone, even a Rite Aid.  Oh my gosh, a convenience store where you have several options of pain relievers, rather than being forced to buy the overpriced single packet of generic tylenol at Hudsons....brilliant."}
{"text":"Is this a mall or is this an airport? Why not both? With more shopping airside than I've seen in a long while, PIT is a pretty good destination if you have a layover. A lot less layovers lately since US Airways decided to de-hub this place, but still, it's pretty cool.  I love airports where you can walk to the rental car garage. That's a big plus for me.  The only thing that's not five stars is that it's a solid twenty miles from the airport to downtown and the traffic is hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"Pretty easy to get through TSA, only took me about 20 minutes in line on a Monday afternoon. Decent food options such as Chikfila, Chinese food, or McDonalds. The airport is spacious, clean, and easy to navigate."}
{"text":"We arrived at Pittsburgh Airport on a Saturday night at 6:00 pm.  I was amazed at how dead the airport was, and that 90% of the stores were rolling down their doors.  You could hear crickets as you made your way to the baggage claim.  From our terminal, we had to take a monorail/ train to the baggage claim.  The trains (like many in the East Coast) are automated, so you grab the first one.  The only bad part is if you're a first timer, you have to figure out what stop to get off. Fortunately, we only had 1 stop, and it was the end of the line.  After getting off the train, you make your way down 2 sets of escalators to baggage claim.  We had to figure out which carousel to find our bags, as by then there was no one really to ask.    We had hired a car and was told the driver would be standing at the bottom of the escalators.  We didn't know there's 2 sets and I was lucky to find my guy.    Tip to picking up: Have your guy meet you at Starbucks.. You can't miss it.  Pretty desolate on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"A reviewer called this place very Eco-friendly...HA....was it the styrofoam or zero recycle bins that triggered this comment???? Are you flicking cigar butts into the river by your camper van when writing your posts?"}
{"text":"PIT isn't my tourist destination, but it is a nice airport.  Long corridors, plenty of space within the terminals to roam and wander.  I did push-ups in one of the concourse because it was relatively empty.  One wing of the terminal was beautifully empty - including the restroom (so for once in my travels I got to have a \"private\" bathroom at an airport - it was like finding paradise.  Also, vegans, there's a make-your-own burrito place here that serves organic tofu - oh yeah."}
{"text":"Small and easy airport to navigate through. I don't think I would try to save money again and drive from NYC to fly home. TSA were asses to my grandma, but that has nothing to do with the airport."}
{"text":"I've traveled all over the world and have been in and out of airports. Pittsburgh is comparable to other international airports but with navigational ease and a tram to transport from one end of the airport to the other. There's a vast selection of places to eat, buy souvenirs and exchange cash. The airport location makes it easy to get to whether living in the city, country or suburbs of Pittsburgh. TSA agents are more patient and friendlier than those in other domestic airports. This makes going through security a little less painful."}
{"text":"The airport itself is not that bad... especially if you remember the old terminal. Not considered to be as modern as it was when first built, it still offers a lot of amenities. There are a number of shops, restaurants and even some exhibits on the history of Pittsburgh.  The rating would be higher, however to enjoy any of these amenities, you have to get through the god awful security line, which might actually take longer than your flight. Good luck, and Godspeed."}
{"text":"This is a serviceable airport that I have frequented many times in the last two years.   The airport itself is relatively clean and has a few good options (especially with the addition of Bar Symon) for a quick bite to eat before catching a flight.   The moving walkways are especially helpful if the lines at security are too long and you need to get from one side of the airport to another.    Overall I will continue to frequent this airport because it is close by and really the only option."}
{"text":"This airport has pretty quick check in and a pretty nice shopping area inside security.  If you have to be here a while you can get a bite to eat and might even enjoy browsing the shopping, though mostly overpriced.  They are clearly in the process of renovating and its going to look pretty nice when done."}
{"text":"Not my favorite airport. Small, bland, no good restaurants, a more aggressive branch of the TSA. And it's located far away from the city itself, making it a pain to get to and from it."}
{"text":"I really thought I'd written a review about the airport, but looks like it hasn't happened yet. Maybe it's a good thing, as I've had more and more occasion to come here (which is fun and exciting on the travel end).  So let's get real. Airports are not fun. Air travel is actually pretty annoying, if I must say so. My thought about a good airport is that you must create a place that makes it less annoying. So what does that take for me?  A good variety of of places to eat, an accessible place to get the essentials that may have been forgotten in the rush to pack and FREE internet. I think this airport has it covered in most areas.   I like that there are at least two \"healthier options\" with food stands that have yogurt, oatmeal, salads, sandwiches, etc. I admit I haven't had much time to devote to the restaurants, as I'm usually in with just enough time to check in and grab my flight (the less time needed the better!).   I also LOVE that there's a Rite Aid here. I can't tell you how many times I've realized on my drive there that I'd forgotten toothpaste or contact solution and known, no problem, I'll just grab it at the airport (and it's not marked up too bad either!).   I'm really glad they have free internet. I know it's always hit or miss when an airport offers it at no charge. The one tip I'll give is that when I bring it up in Firefox it seems to not want to connect. I opened up Chrome and it connected right to it. Just in case you have any issues this should clear it up!  I really wish the airport was closer to the city, as it's a good 25 minutes away from downtown. I know there's really nothing to be done about that other than to build another one closer, which will probably never happen. So I guess the only other option is to move to Robinson or Moon. Not an option for me, so I guess I'm stuck with the long ride.   Speaking of ride, since it's so far away, you have to have some really good friends or someone you have to cash in a favor for to drive you out there or pick you up. There's also an airport flyer (bus) that takes you out there. We learned the hard way that it takes FOREVER. Plus, you have to get downtown first from wherever you live, then catch it in town in the not so frequent times it runs. No thanks. I'll suck it up and pay the $8 a day. I just budget it into trip expenses and call it a day.   I don't understand it, but it seems to be that the security lines at it's busiest, only has about 6 lines (if that) running. There's another 6 being unused. Why not stick a few more people on the job to make things go faster? The line gets out of control early on a weekday! I hate to tell you my \"secret,\" but there's another security option if you go upstairs and across the street. They don't tell you though, you just have to be in the \"know.\" So, you're welcome:)  With that I would say the right amount of time to be there is an hour and a half. I've literally flown (ha ha, get the pun!?) with about a half an hour to spare and gotten on the flight, but I do not recommend it. Especially considering the panic you feel when you must pee and they're paging you on the intercom while you're in the bathroom (oops).   Oh yeah, and if you need Steelers paraphernalia, it's around every corner."}
{"text":"I had been hearing rumors that the airport was opening the heart of its restaurants and mall stores to the public.   During a cool yelp event which I was lucky to attend as a guest of a yelp elite, the airport CEO  confirmed it with the announcement of some mega investing into the new remodel of the airport over the next five years!   Airport access is now available WITHOUT a ticket Mon-Fri from 9-5. You just have to show a valid ID at the PITpass counter near the Allegiant counter at ticketing level to have access to all the food and shopping goodness the airport has to offer. You do have to factor in standard airport parking rates however. The best deal, if you plan to be there more than a few hours to shop and eat is to park in extended and take the shuttle, which can be a big huge pain (especially if you tend to \"lose\" your car there, which I do on the reg. )  Picking a good place to eat was always one of my favorite things I always had to rush thru on my way flying out from the airport. Now, I might just make it a destination lunch date with some girlfriends on an odd day off. And, since I always seem to prioritize eating over shopping, I may now finally have the time to browse the retail stores I always eye up on my way past. The stores at the airport have always lauded themselves on not marking up for airport location and offering street prices, so, we'll see. They have some seriously cool stores there not available elsewhere in Pittsburgh. Great Food! YelpPit"}
{"text":"Decent airport with nice shopping if you have time and money.   PIT is unique from many airports because of the shopping mall located in the central area. I actually cannot afford any of the goods sold here since prices are so high, but shopping is fun even if one doesn't buy. And if you have a long layover it is enjoyable to browse and dream.  Even so, they can take a lesson from Narita Airport on how to mix high end with affordable.   Restaurants are all mediocre as best as I can tell. I've dined in several and don't get that \" I have to fly through PIT more often feeling!\"  They aren horrible though like the restaurants at Philadelphia, Shreveport or São Paulo airports.   If you love football, look for the memorial for hero Franco Harris and if you like dinosaurs there is a t-Rex greeting travelers as they exit the train.   I would give PIT four stars if they had better connections. I'm fine flying direct from Houston but it seems strange that I have to fly through  Philadelphia when coming from Syracuse."}
{"text":"An okay airport. They had the security line moving quickly and it has the rental car pickup and dropoff in covered parking right next to the terminal which was nice since it was snowing."}
{"text":"#Yelp100 Dying airport, not many flights, LOTS of empty gates, shame that this much money was spent to allow the airlines to leave."}
{"text":"Accidentally found myself in this airport after a day of cancelled flights and re-routing.  Its a nice enough place, large open area in the center of the terminals.  Decent selection of restaurants.  Downside is that it is a ghost town in different parts of the airport.  We were in the former US Airways arm and since they pulled their hub from here, it was desolate.  Kinda creepy later in the evening.    that said, there are plenty of options for food, both sit down and fast food."}
{"text":"Other than the overwhelming amount of Steelers...everything, I've got no problems with this airport. (Steelers CROCS though? Seriously?)  Maybe it was just because it was sunny out, but the security staff was all smiley when I came through, and far more efficient than at most airports. Everyone was nice, helpful, and eager to get me where I was going. The signage all makes sense, and the whole rental car process was gratifyingly easy on both ends.  Basically, I didn't have to spend a minute longer than necessary in the Pittsburgh airport, and that's really all I can ask."}
{"text":"Voted 2017's Airport of the Year!   This airport is spacious, clean, and well-decorated. Some of the halls are designed so that it's almost like you're walking through a small museum with neat displays. There's a decently sized t-rex located by the escalators on your way to ground transportation or towards the gates--not quite as large as the one in Atlanta though!  There are loads of different eateries to choose from while you're waiting for your flight. I love how there's a Chick-Fil-A. Convenience is at it's best here.  Car rentals are also easy. Most of the car rental companies have counters located on the ground floor. You'll land directly in front of them coming off the escalators.   There are also cell phone charging stations scattered throughout the airport.  Happy travels!"}
{"text":"Great airport to come into or out of. The lines are never really as long as they seem and the ease of just one terminal eliminates the chance of going to the wrong place."}
{"text":"I really like this airport.  The good: * Cheap long term parking ($7/day) * cheap short term parking (I have only ever paid $1 to pick someone up),  * free wireless internet (though it didn't work on my PowerBook in the United gates, it worked in the food court and in my US Airways gates) * Auxiliary screening checkpoint! They closed terminal E, but turned into an overflow screening area for busy times. Walk out the door by the United counter, across the (now closed) street, and you can get through security pretty quickly during busy times. * Good signange * More food options than just McDonald's and Random Sandwich Vendor * Good layout. Getting around is really easy.  The bad: * US Airways pulled out a lot of their operations, leaving the airport a bit underused. The airport shows a bit of wear for it."}
{"text":"Great staff, nice airport...lines move fast for check in for flights. Parking could be cheaper but not to bad. Not a very big airport."}
{"text":"It's an airport!  It has planes!  It has cruddy fast food!  It has people going places!  And coming from other places!  Holy moly!"}
{"text":"I really have nothing bad to say about the Pittsburgh airport, I must say that security is a lot tighter ever since 9/11 but that's actually a good thing it just takes longer to get to certain flight gates. Other than that there's always good places to shop while you're waiting for your flight to arrive, and I never really had a problem at this place."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about PIT - I travel as few times a year and have never run into any issues.  They have great shops, better than most airports, and it's a shame that the shops are no longer able to be open to the public because there are some unique stores there.  Overall the employees are friendly enough, particularly at the airline counters, and more specifically at Southwest Airlines.  I have recently developed some mobility issues and they've always been great at helping me with getting pre-board and making any accommodations necessary for my travel.    The airport is always clean and it's easy to get through the terminal because it's not too big.  Definitely love that we have such a great airport in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Efficient process. A few things to note:   1. The TSA uses the x-ray type of body scanners. They scanned everyone the morning we went through. 2. After being scanned (\"Just throw your hands in the air, and wave 'em like you just don't care...\"), the TSA lady patted down my braid ... not my body, but my braid. That was new. 3. If you're a Delta devotee, there's no Sky Club here.  Beyond that, everyone was friendly and, as said before, efficient - sadly, that's a plus in domestic travel these days. It should be the norm."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why people have been rating PIT Airport so poorly. Perhaps it's because I travel a bit and believe that comparatively speaking, PIT could be a LOT worse. Hate the security lines? Try going to JFK when you're in a hurry. Think you have to walk far? Please. Go to O'Hara (Chicago) or better yet, De Gaulle (Paris)!   Given the severe reduction in flights over the last fifteen years (US Air's fault, NOT the airport's!) I think PIT is doing well with the resources they have. It is easy to find your way around. There are many food options and free wi-fi. Children can play in the Mr. Rogers playspace. And yes, staff are generally friendly. If you treat them with respect.  Case in point, I had a flight from PIT-DTW which then connected me DTW-PRG (Prague).  The flight was delayed, and then was cancelled due to what I can only assume was a \"broken plane issue.\" People started SCREAMING at the Delta staff. Despite being worried, I waited patiently behind the screamers. When I got to the counter,  I smiled and told the man \"whatever you can do to get me to Prague would be really helpful.\" Not only did he get me out of Pittsburgh within six hours, but he bumped me up to first class on the overseas flight for being polite!  There's always room for improvement, of course. But for an airport that has unwittingly lost its hub status, PIT fares rather well."}
{"text":"This airport has the nicest TSA staff I've ever seen. \"Belts and shoes off,\" bellowed the security checkpoint guard, \"and if you're wearing different colored socks, you're a homeland security risk!\" It was funnier if you were actually there but it's certainly welcome over the rude, power-trip gruffness TSA is known for. Lots of Hello's and big Hello's to children who probably were freaked out by a grown man in a security uniform smiling big and shouting \"Are we havin' fun yet?!!\"  Still, the effort to be nice is appreciated and goes a long way. I half-expected a high-five as I walked through the metal detector.  Pittsburg is a city but a small city so this airport, though an international airport, is a small one--and that has it's Pro's and Cons  PROs: *really short line and fast and friendly process through security gate *easy tram service to the gates *lot of Andy Warhol-esque wall art (found out later that he's from Pittsburgh *very calm airport. It just doesn't have the hustle bustle bust your ass craziness  CONSs: *really lacking in their food court. Your choices are all greasy spoon fast food places. Not very many bars either. You'll see one and there won't be another one for the next 20 gates. If you have a long layover here, and you're healthy, congrats because you'll fast for the next several hours. *seriously lacking in power outlets. Not a laughing matter. Seriousness. I almost passed level 144 of Farm Heroes and my battery died before I could because I couldn't find an outlet anywhere. On top of that, I couldn't check Yelp every five minutes. NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let's get the bad out of the way... and start with the  CONS: - Not much going for the waiting area, as far as I could see. When I want to stretch my time out, hanging with the bf before I pass through the security lines, we end up wandering between the two souvenir shops and finally settling down with a quick pastry at the bakery/cafe. - Not much by way of souvenirs (haha. But who am I kidding. This is Pittsburgh the Steel City. It's the standard shirts, spoons, and shot glasses... because it's mostly about steel, buildings, bridges, Dippy the dyplodicus dinosaur, Heinz, and the Steelers out here). - There is only ONE public bus transportation that services the airport. There's a stop in every area that has a population of over 100 people at any given time within a 5 mile radius (or so it seems), until you get closer to Downtown Pittsburgh.... over an hour later. Can you believe they actually considered cutting off this ONE and ONLY public bus transportation to the airport last year? (Otherwise, you would have to find somebody who could pick you up, rent a car, call a shuttle, or call a taxi.)  PROS: - Out of several visits to this airport (10 times in 2 years so far if you count each way), the check-in process has felt pretty hassle-free. I usually don't ever see more than 5 people in line on any of the counters at any given time.... and this isn't a big airport.... yet they can still fill their planes.  - Security lines are pretty reasonable... (although you CAN get an earful if you forget to put something on the belt _-_) - The building is designed to let a lot of light through... and I very much appreciate it. - Free wireless internet. Thank you, Pittsburgh. This helps stave off boredom... AND it helps to get those online deals on rentals that you may not get otherwise at the rental counters (ie, To get $60 off our rental, the bf actually had to get online and reserve us a car to claim in 5 minutes, because the girl at the counter said they couldn't give us online offers unless we book it online).  The cons look longer because it's oh so much easier to complain."}
{"text":"The airport has changed so much!!! I love how they added much more places to eat and more shops! I was waiting so long for the Pittsburgh Airport to upgraded and it did! We are now almost up to speed with the other airports, but now we just need to be a HUB airport again.   The airport added two Starbucks and more healthy choices to eat now, plus the airport is still cold!! Keep up the great work Pittsburgh for keeping up with the times."}
