{"text":"This deli is a hidden gem for handmade hot sandwiches. It does not look like much from the outside, but is nicer than expected inside. I stopped in by chance with my two daughters and decided to order some BLT's. The BLT's have crazy amounts of bacon. I am a repeat customer now, my favorite sandwich is \"The Mexican Mike\". Finally a sandwich with real heat to it! I plan to try the Cuban and other sandwiches in the future."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Lorain county. This man has been serving me the best sandwiches for years. He was ahead of the curve with the Boars Head brand before it got popular. His product is always fresh and the sandwiches are made to order. You'll hear a few good jokes and get a laugh or two from the owner! He's always in a good mood and suggesting a fresh new sandwich. His other offerings around the store are high quality and priced low. Stuff from Amish country and sweets like Tofts ice cream. If you're feeling brave ask for a secret sandwich off the menu. The Mexican Mike. You'll thank me today. You won't thank me tomorrow. But damn is it good!"}
