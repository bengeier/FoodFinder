{"text":"I was so hoping that I would love this place, but unfortunately it wasn't great.  My review is low because of the service.  We were greeted by two really friendly girls but the good service stopped there.  It took a while to get a waitress and get a drink.  It wasn't even busy.  Then we we got our drinks I had to ask for straws.  We ordered and never saw our waitress again until we were almost finished with our food.  I had to ask another waitress I flagged down for a refill of our drinks.  Pizza was good but my husbands burger was not.  I'm so disappointed, as I had high hopes.  Maybe they will get better"}
{"text":"Awesome set up! Went to check out one of the Golden Knight practices and stumbled upon this gem. There are window's all along the sides of the restaurant that give a great view on to both of the rinks. Great selection of draft beers from microbreweries. I tried the Atomic Duck as well as the Golden Nite Pilsner. For food we had the chicken club rolls and a thin crust Rancher Pizza. I will definitely be back to try out more of the food and drinks."}
{"text":"A cool way to dine while looking over the arena. The service was nice and our server was attentive. We ordered a large Rancher pizza and a small Good ol' boy pizza in thin crust, it was tasty."}
{"text":"This was on of my favorite places to eat in my hometown of Bozeman, MT!!! What a pleasant surprise to have one here in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service from the bar! They are totally understaffed and only have 2 bartenders during Golden Knights games! I have been in Vegas for 35 years in the service industry and they don't get it! Management needs to look at scheduling needs and how much money they are losing per hour based off of bad manager!"}
{"text":"I tried to give this place a third try on March 7. We pulled on the door at 8:50pm and they were locked. An entire adult league team and two other parties were turned away while both ice were still active. What kind of bar closes before 9pm?   This is three tries to do business here. All have failed. It is time for CNA to find a new tenant."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Great atmosphere. Service needs some fine tuning but we have left happy multiple times."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, i showed up and they had a event going on nobody around to help us with our needs . Due to the event they had coolers with beers on the side of the bar so my buddy and i grabbed 2 beers and went to the bar to pay for them , while trying to pay the bartender Anthony was so rude and said those beers were not for us just for the event he snatched them and put them back ! so we had to order 2 other beers from the bar and he had a nasty attidtude then he goes and tells his manager that we grabbed the wrong beers to top it off he gave us back the wrong change i was missing like $6 and he never gave me a receipt so i had no proof! so i talked to the shorter manager can't recall his name and told him what had happened and he didn't care at all he said there was no way of knowing if he charged me extra because i had payed cash not debit . so then i just let it go i said it's ok it's just $6 i guess then  i ask Anthony for another round and he ignored me waited almost 15min and he still ignored me and served other people that got there after i did . So then the other manager named Chris came by and i told him and he actually helped and served us . Thanks to Chris for that but i'm never goin back to this place it's terrible and That bartender needs to be fired he is rude and disrespectful. you do not need workers like that in such a important place for Las Vegas ."}
{"text":"We met another couple for a Golden Knights watch party. Great food menu. Our servers were outstanding, attentive to our every need. Large projection screen gave us a great look at the game."}
{"text":"Went here while watching the #VegasGoldenKnights practice. The food was great and not too expensive. Our server Alfredo was the best part! Really good time and he even paid attention to my 4 year old granddaughter! Gotta go again!"}
{"text":"Been waiting 15 mins not very crowded. Not one person has stopped to take a drink order or anything. Will not be back. We came because of the hockey team. Again we will not be back. There are plenty of other places for a drink and bite within walking distance."}
{"text":"Not like in Montana. Pizza was comparable to a frozen pizza.  Mac n cheese balls   Aah just alright. Customer service was good  over all price was waaaay above good quality"}
{"text":"This is for the website for the Vegas location specifically. The service and food is always good. But, some of the items listed online are not actually available at the restaurant. Some of the kids items are not available. Hard to organize kids orders when you have to change it and convince them to get something else."}
{"text":"The main reason for the 5 stars is the location!!! It's inside City National arena, where you can watch the knights practice as you sip some beer and enjoy a slice of pizza. Other than that it's just like another pub.   Happy hour daily from 3-6 pm throughout the restaurant, $2 off beer and wine and $0.75 chicken wings. I went during happy hour with my kids. They have a nice Kids menu with so many choices. $6 includes drink, side and entree.   Our server Tabitha was excellent. I asked about the daily soup special and she mentioned beer cheese soup. I had never heard of it so she decided to bring me a taste!! How sweet is that!! I tired their \"jacked up taco\" which had this crispy cheese crust over a soft taco shell, stuffed with roasted corn, avocado cream and fresh jalape√±os, so yummm!  You can download their app for points. Also a free flatbread for joining the points program."}
{"text":"It was a pretty cool experience being at the rink & I appreciate that they included a restaurant in the venue. But the food was just average to me.. we enjoyed the cheese curds. Chicken breast sandwich was good but the pineapple salsa is very over-powering, it contained cilantro.. which we are not a big fan of. Thai peanut  chicken wings were decent, it was just ok. Im willing to give this place another try, we may have ordered the wrong items. Next time we are going for the pizza.. it is a pizza place after all."}
{"text":"Came in for the Knights vs Sharks game. We ordered poutine fries, cheese curds, fried pickles and hot wings. Food is ok, nothing amazing, basic bar food. The service is great even while super busy. The poutine fries were the best thing we ordered. Hot wings good but dressing a bit too sweet. The breading the use is just a bit too thick for my personal taste but I was able to pull a bunch off. I'll be back for the games and practices, no doubt."}
{"text":"Not only was this place new and refreshing, but so was my server Melissa!! She was very friendly and suggested the pizza,and even helped me pick out some great toppings for it! I love the fact that you could eat and also watch the Nights practice.l will be back and tell my friends about the great service that Melissa gave us,she definitely made are first dinner  there special!!"}
{"text":"There's a restaurant inside of the City National Arena?   Yes and it's from Montana which happens to be one of my favorite states and the food is delicious! The cherry on top of the sundae is that you can catch the Golden Knight's practicing when they're in town!  The decor could use some work as it felt unfinished to me but I love the views of the ice rinks!  Honestly the food really surprised me. It's not just your typical bar bites. You can order thin or normal crust on your pizza and we opted for thin. The Thai pie was my favorite! Peanut sauce, seasoned chicken, mandarin oranges, scallions, red peppers, peanuts and mozzarella, topped with fresh cilantro. Tip* ask for peanut sauce on the side and drizzle it over the pizza! The BBQ chicken pizza was also fantastic and I don't eat wings but I loved the buffalo ones my man ordered. The menu offers burgers, salads, sandwiches, desserts and much more.   Extra info: Happy hour daily from 3pm-6pm Open for lunch and dinner Restaurant located on second floor Walk straight out to the ice rinks from restaurant   We look forward to our next visit because the burgers here look so good!"}
{"text":"Came in for football and the manager on duty said it had to be one game on one side of the bar and another on the other side. He didn't really have a decent excuse, was somewhat rude, and had treated the situation like an inconvenience.   LOL ummm that's why you have multiple so everyone has an option?   Anyways, onto the food. The pizza was decent but really this review is dedicated to the clam chowder. As soon as I received the dish just the looks of it told me this wasn't going to end well. I maybe had two bites and the texture was horrendous. How do you even call this dish clam chowder?!  Ay yi yi.   I've been back but only for drinks and knights game. I'm scarred by the food. Ouch."}
{"text":"Try the Golden Knights Pilsner on tap!!  Only a true fan would.   We thought we'd check out and support the new team in town. Mackenzie River is located on the second floor of the new City National Arena in Downtown Summerlin.   It's a cool spot, located above the two new hockey rinks (ahhh get it... get it?). We walked around and watched hockey practice while waiting for our food.   We ordered a large Spinach Salad (with candied walnuts, dried cranberries and bleu cheese crumbles) and a large Good Ol' Boy pizza (\"a heapin' portion of extra pepperoni, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce.\"). For two this was just enough food.   Service was great. Food was good. Even if you're not a hockey fan, it's a fun place to hang out. Both the arena and the restaurant are excellent addition to the community."}
{"text":"Great food selection with a great view! The happy hour is awesome as well. We had the stockman pizza and it was loaded with toppings! So glad they have this at the practice arena!"}
{"text":"The food here is great, but the service is horrible!  I fear that after hockey season, this place is going under.  Right now it's the in place to be because you can watch practices or games, those take time, so who cares if it takes 2 hours to get your cold food.  However, once the season ends, this place will be depending on the lunch crowd, and nobody has 2 hours for lunch, and they certainly don't like waiting that long to just get cold food.  Get your act together and get some servers that will take care of their guests!"}
{"text":"Went here the first time and had a bad time decided to give it one more go hoping that maybe it was just an off night but the second time was worst than the first. Came to watch a buddy of mine play in the beer league so i sat inside. Ordered 2 flights just to try all of their beers and it took over 15 mins for them to come out. There was only 2 other guests in the place. I finished them without her coming by to check on me once. Finally was able to flag her down to pay the tab only to take about another 15 mins just to bring the check. After the game we decided to sit at the bar and the bar tender seemed like he hated his job. Seemed like they were all out of beer he just kept saying nope were out of that. Finally we had enough and went to Chicago brewing down the road. Would like to check out the place during a game but the crazy high prices and terrible staff make me want to stay far away from this place"}
{"text":"The poutine burger is phenomenal. The gravy is delicious and the smokey meat flavor is really good. I would definitely come back. Fun place and the servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"Came to have lunch on an extremely slow Sunday. Of the entire restaurant we were one of four tables. We seated ourselves and weren't greeted for 10 minutes. Not a big deal and a waitress came by, said hello and that our server would come by.  When she did she seemed irritated we were there and took our drink order.  When she returned she gave us our drinks and we asked for a minute to look at the menu, 20 minutes later, our drinks were empty and she was no where to be found. I had to ask the bar tender how much an ice tea cost so we could pay our bill.  For a first impression the service was horrific."}
{"text":"I am writing this review based off of the last experience I had here at MacKenzie River which sadly may have lost a permanent patron in myself, the many I have referred to the establishment, and my family. It is actually quite sad because the first time I posted about our very first visit, I was extremely satisfied with the level of customer service by our server Renee, and honestly have never received even half the level of customer service since every time we've gone. Keep in mind, we visit the restaurant at least twice a month. I've looked passed other reviews on the poor service simply because I hoped they were false, but have succumbed to the sad reality that the service here is the exact opposite of the team they represent... Definitely losing in the customer service department.  Yesterday, my family and I decided we'd grab lunch at MacKenzie River during open practice. We entered through the supposed front entrance with the host counter (which is NEVER manned) and waited a good 5 minutes for someone to approach us (and never did). We and other patrons just mutually decided to seat ourselves as NO ONE paid any mind to us waiting in plain sight of the servers. My family and I sat directly outside the entrance to the kitchen overlooking the rink. 5 more minutes pass to which my mother decides to flag someone down. The waitress who she had flagged (who had passed is numerous times into the kitchen) stated she didn't even see us (highly unlikely). So the whole experience with her was one that made us feel as though she A. Disliked her job or B. Disliked us being there. There was nothing warm about her. I let the poor service go overlooked as my toddler seemed to be enjoying himself. Eventually, we were through eating and waited for our waitress to note we were completed and once again, we waited.... And waited... So much so I held on to my credit card with the hopes she would return to take my payment so we could leave. Finally upon her returning to our table, I literally just handed her my card (which I never do) so we could pay and leave. Upon getting the receipt to sign, I made the realization that she charged my card for the entirely  wrong tab. Yes, I admit I made my first mistake in not reviewing the check prior to, but I couldn't stand waiting any longer. She provided me the new receipts and we finally departed.   Due to the angst I faced, I accidentally left my credit card (mistake #2) which I called and confirmed the whereabouts the next day. I spoke to one of the managers, Chris who was honestly one of the most gracious people I dealt with leading up to the other ungracious employees I encountered this evening. I entered the restaurant again at the \"host counter\" to see a waitress there gathering place settings. I ask her if Chris the manager was around as I had left my credit card there the day before. She replies, \"I mean, you can go check. Maybe at the bar they might have it.\" Okaaayyyy... As someone who works in customer service, one thing I know is to handle an issue when it is brought to you NOT to pass it onto the next. And frankly, I specifically asked for the manager by name! So I approach the bar and this pleasant woman asks if she could help me, to which I again ask for Chris. She took my name and said she'd check, then proceeded to complete a task to which a male bartender asked if I had been helped. I respond, \"yes, I accidentally left my credit card here yesterday.\" Instantly after responding to him, the female bartender replies, \"yes I said I would get it for you.\" Excuse me?? I simply just replied to a question the male bartender asked and she replies as though I was asking him to do what she said she was going to do (and didn't). Thankfully for me, the male employee quickly retrieved my credit card in a swift minute that would've probably only taken the first two people I encountered the same amount of time.  One star for Chris. One star for Renee from our first visit."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and the service was horrible. The place wasn't even busy and we couldn't get anything we asked for. The waitress seemed to be in a daze. The food was ok but nothing to over come the lack of service. I doubt we would go back even if we were there to watch practice, shop, or skate."}
{"text":"Opened recently. Plenty of comfortable seating. Friendly waitresses. I enjoyed the soup, and the pizza was decent but I had the regular crust and it wasn't top notch so I'd try the thin crust next time if I went the pizza route again. I'm definitely going back even if I'm not watching hockey there."}
{"text":"Great food and hockey! Can't get much better then that! Reasonable prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We were a group of four adults and two teens.  We came for lunch the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  Alfredo, our server was extremely helpful when we asked for suggestions.  In fact, I believe our entire experience was so positive due to him. We followed his suggestions when ordering and found the food delicious. We will certainly be returning and hope to be served by Alfredo again."}
{"text":"City National Arena is one of the coolest places on earth. It's really laid-back and you can be up close to a professional sports team practice without any hassle. This restaurant is run very well, the service is fantastic and the ambience is great. Sadly the food is really subpar. It isn't horribly expensive but the quality of the food they're serving is pretty bad. The hamburgers tasted like institutional lunch room style meat. The mac & cheese tasted like paste with a bit of flavoring and the chicken nachos, while unbelievably huge, were somewhat cold and they came out with very little flavor. The salsa was from Vons or somewhere. Very uninspired. I gave two stars to get management's attention. The food really was surprisingly pretty blah in this great setting.  * Update 6/15/08. We threw our daughter a skating birthday party here yesterday. I reserved tables for 15 kids and some parents. The service, set up and ease of pulling this off was impecable. Thank you Jason and all at McKenzie River. The pizzas we ordered were delicious. It's great to see Vegas thrive!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, plus they do flights if you're indecisive or wanting to try a couple new ones. Their happy hour is DAILY for 3 hours which is pretty awesome on weekends! Great spot to watch games, see the golden knights practice, and grab some food. Food is good. Poutine was not what I expected for $8 but the wingers were great! We had buffalo and Thai peanut wings both were great. And the buffalo isn't too hot for me (I'm a weenie). Overall great little spot in a nice new rink service is just a tad slow. If you have the time and you're not in a rush check it out!"}
{"text":"The food is good for being a bar.  I had the Rueben which was delicious. They have a great lunch special which is buy 1 get the same meal half off.  The special has a lot of different choices for groups of two who have diversified appetites. If you like hockey, beer and bar food, this place hits the spot."}
{"text":"This is my third time eating here and I thought maybe the service was bad because the game was on, but it's been consistently terrible every time I eat. I usually sit staring at servers hoping I'll get some service, after 10-15 minutes I'll get asked what I want to drink so I just order my food at the same time. When my food arrives, either the runner drops it off before I can ask for anything, or I ask for something like napkins or ketchup, and I never get it. The food is so good it pains me to give a bad review but this is absurd."}
{"text":"Two people had lunch. One burger, one slammers/sliders. Both sick approximately 12 hours later. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Go Knights Go! Food and beer was excellent fun place to go for lunch and watch practice would love to watch a VGK game there. Check it out you won't be discounted!"}
{"text":"Wow. Enjoying great pizza and wonderful location that sits between two ice rinks - the Vegas Golden Knights practicing on one and some aspiring hockey players scrimmaging on the other. Sat along the window where you could see all that was happening on the ice. You can even exit the restaurant and take a seat in the bleacher seats even closer to the action. Service was wonderful as were the prices and quality of the food. A sure bet that I'll return every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch to miss the crowd watching the Golden Knights practice.  This a great place to do that by the way - but it gets crowded.  Tried the regular crust Stockman pizza.  They also have a thin crust version that I will need to try.  The regular crust was thick enough, I only finished half of a small order.  It was good, but not a must have for me.  The venue is amazing, the food and the service were both just average this time."}
{"text":"Just gross. The only cool thing about it is the hockey rink. The food is just so gross I can't even believe it. Its dirty and slow as hell. I would rather eat scraps"}
{"text":"How hard is it to say \"we are closing soon\" over the phone? Obviously it is for Josh who I spoke over the phone. Josh also assumed he gave directions to a female when I called back to make a complaint. Can't spell ASSume without being an ass. Making it seem like I am at fault for his short comings he became defensive and slammed the phone. No proper ending of a call and not once did he apologize. Whoever does the hiring for this company needs to reevaluate their selection in colleagues. Your patrons will mostly be local and yo treat a local this way is rude. I didn't and probably wont't try the food because of the service tonight."}
{"text":"Really fun night with tasty food. Watched the Golden Knights game and had dinner. Started with poutine and then followed up with the smokehouse burger, fries and fried pickles.   The poutine was quite tasty. Go figure. Add gravy and cheese curds to fries.   The smokehouse burger was a burger (high quality beef) with pulled pork and Gouda cheese. The fries had the skins on and were fresh from the fryer.   Can't go too wrong with fried pickles. These were spears and very tasty.   Nice selection of beers. Spartan lager was crisp and delicious   Emily, our server, did a great job. Place was packed and she was always close by for orders.   Better than we expected actually."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:30 PM prior to the UNLV game and were seated immediately. We requested one of the low top tables. There are a number of high top tables that provide a view of the ice rinks with the best being along the windows. Service was friendly and fairly prompt considering the place was doing a brisk business. The Baja Fish Tacos consist of two flour tortillas with spicy breaded or grilled cod fillets, pineapple salsa, arugula and avocado sour cream. The dish is served with a heaping pile of blue tortilla chips and a house salsa. The container of salsa was very small. Don't hesitate to ask for more salsa.  I chose the grilled cod which was tasty and the pineapple and sour cream complemented the fish very well.  The Slammers are three mini burgers. The burgers were cooked well done as requested. The mini's are served with American cheese and fried onions on brioche buns. A  very filling meal.   The menu has many choices. The pizza seemed to be very popular. We will be back."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Las Vegas! This restaurant/bar is in between two ice arenas with view of both. We were privileged to watch the Golden Knight while dining on nachos, salad and some drinks at this restaurant. Staff was great but very busy, but we are patient and could clearly see they got bombarded all at once because the Golden Knights were practicing so be patient and give the servers a break. Anyway, the nachos were HUGE and delicious, Caesar and Cobb salads were delicious. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.  Good Happy Hour everyday if you come from 3-6pm.  $2 off wine and beer and $0.75 wings.  Besides the Happy Hour, MacKenzie is just your basic bar with a unique view of a hockey rink.  Lots of TVs make Mackenzie a solid spot for watching games, but it lacks the high quality food to get you to come for any other reason.  The beer menu isn't all that bad with a few IPAs and some local options.  Wine wasn't very good but it's cheap at $6.50 or $24 for a bottle.  If you get the chance, come for a Golden Knights game.  But in any case, MacKenzie is probably a top 3 hockey bar for viewing in the city."}
{"text":"The restaurant needs a manager that pays attention to detail . Came in around 3:00 pm and half the tables were still dirty , like other reviews no one at the front door to sit us . The food is ok but the place is pilotless with lack of service , great idea poor execution  Probably will not go back"}
{"text":"The wings were on the smaller side and by the looks of it triple fried. Very sad and way overcooked. The house salad was spring mix, carrots and two small pear pieces.  For such a great venue the food is very basic. I felt sorry for the lone bartender handling 20+ patrons solo. Much better options in downtown summerlin."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers, friendly service and occasional Knights players dining near you, go Knights Go"}
{"text":"What could be better? Hockey, Happy hour and good food. We went to watch a Knights game which on top of it all they won! Service was a little slow, but that was understandable since the place was standing room only. Must say I really liked the pizza. Not the typical style I look for but it was awesome. There are rinks on each side and there were Can/AM (kids teams) playing on each. If you have never seen a live hockey game try hitting this place when UNLV is on the ice."}
{"text":"Great restaurant on its own! Fantastic restaurant considering it's in an ice rink! The food is delicious and they have a great selection of drinks. Dominique is a wonderful server! She is very attentive, friendly and sweet! The only critique I have is that this restaurant supports the Vegas Knights. Go Sharks!"}
{"text":"Bar staff terrible.  After being ignored most of the night, when ordering another Manhattan I unfortunately asked for a new glass with a cube because the old one was melting.  Bartender got mad, grabbed the old glass and stated \"what? Is the glass chipped or something?\" Couldn't believe it.  He stormed off.  Horrible."}
{"text":"New pizza pub located above the practice ice at City National Arena . We came here on a whim after a nice long hike at red rock . The Vegas Golden Knights were on a half hour after we arrived and the place picked up to a steady pace of VGK clothing wearing super fans .   We arrived for happy hour . The draft beer selection was above average and they had a nice selection of canned as well .   As for the food we ordered  the poutine fries which were a little light on the cheese curds  and came out a little below warm .  We also got the Humble pie original crust which was loaded with cheese but only gets a 6 /10 on my personal pizza rating system .   We will however be back because it's a great apt to watch a VGK game with other new found fans in LV."}
{"text":"I was really hoping this would be a great place and would have given it a better rating if it was even decent however the food is average and the service terrible. The location is great but very disappointing this could've been a local great bar. All I can say is if you are in customer service at least hire happy people or servers that would actually service the customer.   The manager comp'd half of our ticket but we would've gladly paid full we just brought to his attention how our server never checked on us and drinks for refill or we order ... at a bar!!!!!   Manager said they were under staffed I think the kitchen is just slow. Hoping this place will turn around."}
{"text":"This is a cool hangout! I ordered a Golden Night Pilsner & the Willow Creak Sandwich. Both were delicious! I came here around 1pm on a Saturday. The Knights were not practicing, nor was it a game day. My servers/ bartenders were very friendly & attentive. I've seen similar joints like this at practice facilities/ softball parks etc... This place could be all sorts of mediocre & over priced, but I found totally the opposite. When you walk in, it has a YardHouse sort of vibe to it. Servers were friendly, food was  VERY good & appropriately priced for what they offer & what the similar competition around here offers (Yardhouse, BJ's, Dave & Busters, Public School, Lazy Dog etc...) they could use some signs on the first floor directing you where to go!"}
{"text":"Go for an out of town Knights game...ambiance is PURE hockey.  Good food, great service.  Cool vibe being where the Knights practice an also hockey games happening on either side of you.  A++"}
{"text":"Great food (especially the pizza), nice beer selection, and good wine. The view of the ice is awesome for watching a game! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today to watch the VGK kick some LA booty in the playoffs!   Although packed in here, there is lots of seating recommended to get here by 4:00 to get a seat for the 7:30 playoff game...so it must be pretty popular   The food is average bar food, nothing to brag about.  We had the cheese pizza, pretzel sticks, Nachos, wings, and fried pickles   the pizza and pretzels were good, while the nachos didn't even have seasoned beef. I thought the fried pickles were tasty but would have preferred chips instead of spears!"}
{"text":"We all work at Mandalay Bay and someone thought it would be fun to go to a Golden Knights game. We were due for some fun and so many people wanted to do this. We decided 20 of us could not afford to go to T Mobile. One of my supervisors who is a season ticket holder at T Mobile, suggested we have a hockey party in this restaurant at the top of the City National Area. So I organized this gathering. I spoke to the manager and made arrangements for us on Sunday Dec 3. I went a week early to check out the facility. I'm originally from Canada and this arena really impressed me. When we arrived the manager did not live up to his word and we made some other arrangements for our large party. But once we met Chris Dejesus, the assistant manager, everything was much better. It was so much fun to watch the VGK - they were actually playing at T Mobile. We won this game in overtime. The week before our gathering people went in search of jerseys and T shirts. For some, this was their first time watching a hockey game. I ordered appetizers and a couple of pizzas for everyone. The food is amazing. The apple & chicken flatbread was delicious. Some of the other things we ordered were Cowboy Nachos, Cheese Curds, Mack N Cheese Bites. Wings. The desserts were fantastic also - the cheesecake and some kind of chocolate cake. We were all so impressed with the food. We definitely will come back again another time and we'll be sure and ask for Chris! Go Vegas Knights!"}
{"text":"The service is absolutely terrible. Even if you order in it is terrible. And you better make sure you check that your food is right before you leave. But the food deserves four stars on its own. I remember eating on the Mackenzie river places in good ole Bozeman MT! It is nice that some of  my old home is in my new home!"}
{"text":"Food is delish, nice place to eat, drink and watch hockey."}
{"text":"The food was good and our server Elaine was very efficient, personable and informative! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! My boys and I come for ice skating and we always stop by for some food and drinks after a skate session. Service is typically excellent, but they do run into some issues when they are busy for Golden Knights games and every single seat in the restaurant is taken. They have everything from Pizza to Salads/ I'm a big fan on this place and will continue to visit.  Update: Going on 4 burnt pizzas in 2 weeks. The blamed the first 2 on the cheese vendor, now I'm not sure what the excuse is. Downgrading from 5 to 3  Update: Pizza isn't being burnt anymore, but we learned to order at least one topping on it which appears to save the pizza. The staff is also doing a better job bussing the tables and keeping the place clean."}
{"text":"1st to review and it's a great review! Located upstairs in the brand new home of the Las Vegas Golden Knights training facility, McKenzie River has the feel of a pub with the ambiance of a sports facility! Service is spot on and very attentive! I got the Stockman Pizza with Italian sausage, steak, bacon, mozzarella and cheddar cheese! The original crust is light and flavorful! The pizza sauce is amazing and bold in flavor! I also tried the mud pie and of course it was amazing! Great views of both ice rinks too! Great place to eat and kick back! I will be coming back and be a regular! So glad this place is finally here! Welcome to Summerlin!"}
{"text":"A fun spot to grab some food and watch the Vegas Golden Knights practice. We decided to try the restaurant since we were already there grabbing our season ticket holder's jersey. The food was better than I had expected.   The restaurant is located on the second floor of the practice arena. There is plenty of parking in front of the building. Inside the restaurant there are tables, but most of the seating is bar style seating. There is a large bar in the middle, but the best seating is the bar style seating with a large window to the practice rink.   We enjoyed a small Caesar Salad, Chicken Chili, and a large Rancher pizza. The Caesar salad and chicken chili were okay, but not good enough to order again. The Rancher pizza was pretty good. The crust was tasty with herbs and a buttery taste. The pizza was also loaded with toppings and the crust was substantial enough to hold all of the toppings.  The service was okay, but definitely could use some improvements. The good was that our server didn't take long to greet us after seated and took our orders without much delay. The bad was that our starters came at the same time as our pizza instead of first, we weren't given plates with our pizza, and we had to track someone down to get a spoon for the chili. Hopefully those small kinks will get worked out over time."}
{"text":"So Mackenzie River Pizza has been our spot to watch the Golden Knights!  It's also located inside the City National Arena where the Golden Knights practice! So your thinking how's the Food though!!!! Let me just say you won't be disappointed! So if you can't make it to T-Mobile  head over to MRPG&P!"}
{"text":"The pics that follow are from my first stop in here where i had  to check it out 13 days ago.  The following review is from today, 9-30-2017. Ok, I heard the hype about the food and Tried it out.  I love hockey, great the Knights are here. First, wings were raw, ughh. Second, the pepperoni pizza came out under cooked and doughy and uncut!  Good thing I had a knife to cut it with. Bad food, but good flavor leaves me confused. Not sure about trying it again yet.  One star is for the good beer on tap.  Tip, order your food well done."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the city national arena to go to the arsenal and while in the arena we saw the restaurant so we decided to finally check it out once and for all.. What a mistake and quite frankly a waste of time!! We checked out the menu and sat down as the sign said \"Seat yourself\"  We sat down and sat there and sat there, for about 10 minutes. Nobody ever once came by and said we will be with you, or gives us just a minute. I looked around a few times and the other customers were being helped but we were never even approached. Its disappointing because the menu looks great!! I, myself and I'm the customer service industry and to not even be acknowledged is ridiculous.  Not happy!!"}
{"text":"VGK and co. did an extremely nice job with City National Arena and their really good sports bar on the 2nd floor. Decent amount of space with a full bar and restaurant style seating thats totally family friendly. Went to to watch the Knights vs Pens game a couple weeks back and enjoy it a lot! Couple of beers on draft including the Golden Knights beer that's brewed locally. All the food we tried was good but the BBQ brisket pizza really stole the show, it was excellent.  What's also cool is the restaurant is between both hockey rinks so if there's a league game and/or just some folks skating around, you can see them too. Must check out if you are a VGK fan."}
{"text":"Food was good.   Prices - bar prices.   Service - average.  Best part - restaurant in between the rinks ... can take drinks into rink."}
{"text":"The place was packed when we showed up and the front hostess stand was empty, so we helped ourselves to seats at the bar. This was a good choice as we were then served by the bartender, Bryan, who was awesome and actually one of the best bartenders I've ever had.   We ordered drinks and food, I got a Kentucky mule which was delicious enough for me to finish it before our meal came out of the kitchen. I ended up ordering a cup of chicken chili and a house salad. The small chili is actually a pretty good amount of chili and it filled me up. The house salad is typical, but no complaints. I did like that they listed all of the dressings in the menu and you had the option of which to add (I did the raspberry which was a good choice).   Overall we liked our meal here and the views of the practice facility are pretty cool if you can get a seat along the windows. But it's not really something we are planning to go out of the way to go get. We are hoping to try out the happy hour in the future, but unless we're going to downtown summerlin or to the practice facility for something, that won't be for a while."}
{"text":"Just left with my kids after sitting for 20 minutes without anyone taking the initial drink order. The first waitress said she would be right back with the kids menu, never saw her again. The 2nd waitress asked if anyone helped us. I said she is supposed to be bringing menus. 2nd waitress dropped off menus but never asked what we wanted. Never saw her again either. Sat around searching and watching other employees walk by us acting like we weren't there."}
{"text":"We ate at MacKenzie's at least 4 times, and the food was always good, and the fact that you can watch people ice skating or watch UNLV playing a game is always fun.  However the last time we were there which was yesterday Nov. 9th, UNLV was hosting an alumni party as well as UNLV playing against another team so it was crowded.  It has been crowded before and everything was fine, but this time the food WAS TERRIBLE.   We ordered 2 Reuben sandwiches which basically is corn beef, cabbage, thousand island dressing on grilled marbled bread.  Not much to ruin, right?  However I don't expect my sandwich to contain large pieces of fat attached to the corn beef!  Kitchen staff, just a word to the wise when you put meat in a sandwich make sure its meat and not the fat, no one ways to bite down on pieces of fat.  The sandwich was tasteless, thousand island dressing were you in there? didn't taste any.... just a shame... brought it to the managers attention and he bought us a dessert for not enjoying our dinner.  Nice thought... but we came for dinner, not dessert and our dinner was not enjoyable.   Consistency is very important in a restaurant.  I don't go for the beer or Happy Hour, I go for the food, and I thought we found a great place but unfortunately like everything else, you get the customers to come in with the perks (watching hockey being played) and then you slack off on your food.  Not good, so I would say the food needs improvement, managers check what is going on in your kitchen and make sure the food comes out the way it is supposed to.  No one wants to pay for food that isn't acceptable.  It is a shame, because the food was good and now it isn't.  So just thought I'd give you a heads up..... enjoy the hockey and ice skating and the beers but be careful about the food, it is not up to par."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times to eat, grab a drink while my little guy is skating, and to watch a game. I can say the service is usually below par. It's seat-yourself and it is not very organized. Best service is at the bar, but if you do get a table you are likely to wait, wait, and wait.... And you may even watch your cold drink get warm waiting up at the bar to get picked up!!  I really think it has more to do with management than the wait staff. Normally i would give this place 2/3 star because the food is above average but the service is below, but.... I'm giving it 4 starts because I have hope after last night. I think our server's name was Carson. He says he usually doesn't work the Thursday early evening shift, but came in. He was great! Great service, above average food, cold beer, and hockey! What more can you ask for!. Hope this continues! Management......Wake up! You got a good thing going.... Don't blow it! Hire and take care of servers like Carson and train them like him also."}
{"text":"food is really good. place sucks for trying to get a seat. they don't take resi, that's fine. But at least DON'T make it a free for all for the seats. Seriously, no hostess? C'mon."}
{"text":"First time to one of their restaurants with friends to watch a hockey game and critique the pizza, from three New Jersey Pizza Snobs, judging a pizza place where the majority of their restaurants are located in Idaho, North and South Dakota, not exactly known for pizza, well maybe Pizza Hut and Dominos. That being said, an order was placed for their \"Good ole boy\" pepperoni pizza regular, not thin crust pie. While maybe on the salty side from the pepperoni and the generic tasting tomato sauce, it wasn't terrible, though could have been left in the oven maybe a minute longer for a crispier crust.  At least it wasn't rolled out white bread with ketchup and cheese. Also ordered were an order of Slammers (sliders) which were very good, about four times the meat than White Castle. The assortment of beers on tap was very acceptable as there were several local craft beers to choose from as well as a full bar.  Two stars for the poor service by our bartender. When asked for a simple glass of water he said he already started to break down his side of the bar and the other, already busy, bartender would get it for me....12 minutes later!"}
{"text":"Great Hockey bar, good food, plenty of beer choices, quality cocktails, very good service."}
{"text":"1-7-17~We come here for UNLV hockey games and Knights practice. But we've never been to the restaurant overlooking the ice. Lucked out and got the last table an hour before the Knight's game. Awesome crowd of fans. Tabitha was our waitress. She was very friendly and came by many times to check on us. She knew the menu inside and out. We got a pizza. It was incredible. Really good bacon on it. My boyfriend got a couple beers (reasonably priced) and I got hot chocolate which was great! This was our first time dining here. We will definitely come back. Anywhere you sit is good. There are many tv's throughout the restarant/bar. They have windows all the way down the sides that allow you to look down on the practicing hockey games below. Decor is very cool close up hockey photos. Very clean restaurant. Loved the place."}
{"text":"This is a very cool place to come and get some good grub and have some beer.  They have a great menu and they offer a great selection of beer and local breweries..   It's conveniently located by downtown Summerlin and adjacent to the Knights practice facility."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with our experience here! Have been to another location and loved the food. Couldn't wait for my husband to experience it and the fact that it's at the Golden Knights practice arena made the idea even cooler!  It's not easy to find if you aren't looking for it, no signage downstairs to indicate that it's on top of the rink. It sits in-between both practice rinks with windows on both sides to watch. The idea of it is cool which is why I didn't give it one star.   When you walk in, I guess you just sit yourself. There's a hostess stand but no one to staff it and no sign to tell you to take a seat. Another patron told us after we stood at the front looking confused for 5 minutes. Once we sat someone did come to the table to drop menus quickly. Then she sat at the table behind us to eat her shift meal which was awkward.  My husband ordered a Cobb salad, daughter ordered kids Mac and cheese and I ordered a turkey avocado sandwich. The turkey avocado sandwich was the best pick of the 3. The kids mac was swimming in cheese sauce which seemed very unappealing to me but my cheese loving daughter was ok with it. It came with a fruit cup that was supposed to have cantaloupe, pineapple, and grapes. It has pineapple and cantaloupe and grapefruit in a really strange sauce/syrup. Kids don't like grapefruit from my experience, the fruit sat. The Cobb salad didn't look bad upon first look. We ordered the large which was an ok size but not a large salad by any means. The greens weren't that of a normal fresh crisp Cobb, they were limp. The eggs tasted \"gassy\" and the chicken tasted old and rubbery. My husband felt everything was pretty old and definitely what you'd expect out of a fresh salad.   Bummer it wasn't better! Will have to take my husband to the location out of state so he doesn't think I'm crazy for loving their food!"}
{"text":"Ugh... I love to hate this place. My sons hockey schedule leads me here at least twice a week... The food is good, BUT, the tables are always dirty, I bring my own wipes. The joint is ALWAYS understaffed, you can't order and get your check paid in a 1hour practice window.. ALWAYS standing waiting for check unless I ask for it with my food or even right after I order......On game days.... FORGET IT!! I just want a salad, but if it's a game day you can't even move or find a seat and they never have the stupid snack bar open to just grab something. What's the point in having it?? There are actually people who JUST want food and don't want to sit like a sardine watching the game. Better to just eat before practice those days or I end up eating junk from the vending machine. I go here because it's the only option... not great."}
{"text":"Who knew there was a restaurant was inside the Golden Knight's training facility?  Just when you think Downtown Summerlin has it all, you stumble upon this gem.    We arrived at Happy Hour wondering if this treasure we found on Yelp even existed.  After asking around we went up a floor and stumbled upon the entrance.  Inside you were greeted with the warm glow of a pub surrounded by two skating rinks.  Listening to the sounds of the games and practice below was awesome.  Want to take a peak inside the rink?  No problem, open one of the two doors and you're there.    We sat at the bar and listened to the Bartender tell us about the menu and the specials.  Apparently, they are owned by the Golden Knights owner and are not spending too much on advertising.  Selfishly, I hope this continues because I'm guaranteed a great seat if It kept under wraps. (Insert wink)  The must haves are the wings and the fried pickles to start.  The reuben pizza was so unique and tasty, I can see the sandwich in my future.  My husband had the sliders which were huge and tasty.  Finally, we shared a salad and the vegetables were fresh and the dressing was homemade.    The drink pours were generous and not what you would expect in a building that must have cost a fortune to build.  I loved the GK pilsner.  I must admit, the first visit was so great we came back Sunday with the kids.  They watched a tournament and we supervised from the table area.  The only downside-plastic wine glasses for the obvious reason.  However, if that's my only complaint, I think they will be just fine."}
{"text":"After being stationed in Great Falls MT for 7 years and enjoying this place, I now get to enjoy it whenever I want again!  Love everything about this place, food, ect...Employees work hard and keep MacKenzie River Pizza just as great as in MT!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. Awesome location. I'm trying to figure out who eats that pizza in the testing phase and says \"we have a winner'. Safe your $ and eat Pizza Hut's nasty garbage before you get here for half the price. I will eat here again. It's a great venue and I hope the other food is better."}
{"text":"New favorite bar alert-- I love this place so much and regret that I never came here during a Knights game. I can't even imagine how much fun that is. I plan on being a regular here so  I will update after I experience a Knights game. Go Knights Go.  I came here on the day they were having the police versus fire game. Very cool to see. The place was not that busy when we arrived and the service was a tad slow but it's okay.  The menu is not that big but they have some great choices. They even have mud pie for dessert which I was so pumped about because nobody really serves it anymore. The problem was that I was so full I could not order it.  We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the grilled fish tacos. They were both very good. I thought the tacos coming in a flour tortilla was kind of strange but then I realized there was just no way they could put that much filling in a corn, so I was happy.  They have a good selection of beer. We had a Golden Knight Beer and it was delicious. I thought the 8.00 price tag was a little rude considering this is pretty much a locals bar and locals will not keep paying that much for beer when we have so many other local locations that are way cheaper.  They do have an app you can download if you plan to go there a lot like me. The first time you download you will get a free flatbread with a 15.00 purchase, so basically 2 beers. It also let's you earn money towards a future meal. Kinda cool.  Can't wait to return, prob going this weekend again. LOL! Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was not the greatest. Server not attentive to our order. Never checked back to see how everything was. Didn't offer napkins with food. Would disappear and had to wait ask bartender for check. Apparently she was cleaning something in back..."}
{"text":"Whoever thought of placing a pub in view of two ice rinks was genius! If you don't see anything on the TVs you like, watch some hockey players practice! I was actually surprised at how nice of a pub it was. It's huge and well staffed. I would give it 3.5 stars but our waiter was so nice I bumped it up to 4. With their happy hour prices being higher than most of the neighboring Downtown Summerlin spots, you are paying for the view. We ordered 3 beers and 2 appetizers and the bill was $60 with tip. The chicken wings were recommended by our waiter. They're baked first then fried, which makes for an extra crispy wing! The Thai curry sauce on the wings was full of flavor and had a nice bit of heat. We also ordered the poutine, fries topped with cheese curds and brown gravy. It was gobbled within minutes it was so good! The fries maintained their crispy texture despite being laden with melting cheese curds and gravy. I have no complaints about the food or the service, as neither disappointed. My only gripe is the happy hour apps are $8 and up, which isn't very competitive for the area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend, daughter, and I came to try this place for happy hour on a Sunday. We decided to try because it's so close to my work (Red Rock Casino) and they were brand new inside the new practice arena for the Golden Knights.   I was pleasantly surprised that they have a happy hour 7 days a week. 2-6pm. We ordered (mainly) happy hour menu items. We had the Mac and cheese bites, cheese curds, fried pickles, and the poutine fries. All of them were delish! We didn't care too much for the poutine fries though bc they were a little soggy with the gravy on top.  My daughter had the kids menu mini corn dogs and fries. I was impressed she also got a side of fruit w her order. And she ate it all up (which says a lot bc my daughter is a picky eater).   The staff was excellent. Always making sure we were good and even brought a second round of drinks before we finished our first round.  I'll def be back to try out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Updated review: how does this place expect to be taken seriously as a viewing center for the team, in the teams own facility, when they cant accommodate their fans? It's absurd to expect people to show up 2 hours in advance so you can hope to get a table. It's also absurd to hold reserved seating for only certain groups of people, while simultaneously telling your core demographic that there's no reservations allowed. Guess I won't be bringing my family to one of the few \"family friendly\" viewing establishments anymore.     I'm giving this place only two stars for the lack of seating for persons who are handicapped. Yes, I know this is technically a \"bar\", but it's family friendly, and for the games, there is not enough low top seating available.  My mother is older and disabled, and unable to be seated in the taller chairs. 3/4 of this place is the high tabletops and high stools, which are not helpful to someone who cannot be seated in them. nor are they family friendly.  There is plenty of space for more tables. I hope the owners take this into consideration and add more low top tables."}
{"text":"Poor service and seems understaffed for the amount of inattentiveness the employees pay their visitors. Sad as it has so much potential"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with views of both hockey rinks. I've never been to a place quite like this. The beer selection is alright, I do appreciate the alternative options. I had the chicken chili, which was absolutely delicious, and the hot sauce selection is impressive. Service was good. I recommend coming here when there's a Golden Knights game on. I'll return but not a frequent spot for me."}
{"text":"Didn't take long for people to ruin this place.    Food isn't great,  but it was a fun enough atmosphere to come watch the Knights games.    You call in early and they tell you they won't take reservations,  then you get here 2 hours before the game starts and every table is being held down by a single person.   Tables open up and the employees start cleaning them and telling you they are reserved.   The girl was friends with the people and she was clearly sitting them because of it.    Bottom line is that the food isn't good enough to justify the wait or the hassle.  It's not better than the most average PTs food you've ever had.     Plenty of bars with better food in Downtown Summerlin.   Save yourself 5 hours of standing and enjoy the game."}
{"text":"Nice view of the practice rinks, roomy facility with nice selection of tap beers and liquor.  We had the taco, daily soup, and a beer.. the staff was friendly, but not overly social.. the food we found to be a bit overly salty, but came out accurate and hot.  Bottom line.. we will give it another chance!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night 2-15-18 What a great new culinary addition to our town! This place is not only visually amazing but it definitely meets my expectations for pub style eats.   Starting with our sever TABATHA! This cheerful, knowledgeable and efficient server brought her A game! What a delightful person. She was very familiar with the menu, able to answer all of our questions and even made an off the menu virgin drink that was delicious!  Our party of four was well taken care of.  We started with the Apple & Chicken Flatbread. AMAZING! We had half of the dish made vegetarian! This suggested by Tabatha so the entire table could partake.  For my entr√©e I decided on the Green Horn Veggie Wrap. It was soooo delicious! I enjoyed every bite.  The food was fresh and well made. I also had fries (these are made to perfection) because hey sometimes I get all wild and crazy! Haha 5 stars! I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Great food and drink and you can watch practice games for the golden knights! Fun time good drinks full bar and good deals on food fun staff!"}
