{"text":"I've been to a lot of pizza places in CLT and still find Marios's the tastiest NY style pizza. Their entrees are also good."}
{"text":"We have relocated to Charlotte / Matthews from Metro Detroit and one of the things we miss is a Bismarck Pizza from Supino's Pizza at Eastern Market in Detroit.  Tonight we found the pizzeria that could make us one.  Absolutely delicious and even better crust than Supino's.  Dave the manager even said whn they move locations they are considering putting the Bismarck Pizza on the menu.

Absolutely our favorite pizza at our new favorite pizza place.

5 Stars no doubt."}
{"text":"We have been going to Mario's pizza for the last several years and it has always had consistently good food and some of the best pizza in Charlotte.  My wife is from NYC so it was a requirement that we find something relatively close to her home-town pizza, and Mario's fit the bill.  Over the past year or so, it seems that Mario's has slowly been changing the pizza to the point that now, I may rank it below one of the many chains.  I can't put a finger on any one specific thing, but it has gone way down hill.  The crust seems to now be thicker and less crispy, the cheese is lower quality (though they seem to be putting more on, which means worse taste and more grease), and the sauce is not quite as good as it used to be.  I hope this changes but until then, i will be looking for a new pizza joint."}
{"text":"Great place to go! The complementary garlic knots have great flavor and their pizza is phenomenal. The crust is crispy and it's not too greasy.  Their custumer service is also amazing!  I would recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Came here for an elementary school spirit night. The food was ok, but there was no kids menu. They charged $8-10 for a small plate of noodles and plain red sauce for kids and extra for kids drinks! Unbelievable! You can cook spaghetti noodles for a whole family for $2! For 4 kids this added up to whole lot of wasted money and the biggest tab we've ever had at an average quality restaurant such as this. We felt totally ripped off and will not be returning."}
{"text":"To be honest, this review is 90% about the prices, 10% about the pizza - here goes:

Prices - WAY to high and I'm from NYC $6.43 for 2 slices - are you serious?
Pizza - Average"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with the new location.  We frequented the old location many times for kids spirit nights, birthdays, etc. and always enjoyed it and felt welcomed.  But tonight, we felt like it was no longer a place for kids.  The kids menu is no longer printed.  The place has smaller rooms, more closed off.  The t-shirts and deserts that used to be right at the door of the old place were nowhere to be seen.  Parm cheese, red pepper, pizza stands were all gone from the tables.  Less TV's (only noticed one).  Cloth napkins instead of paper, but they kept the plastic 'glasses' ...confusing!  The best description we could come up with for the new location was \"sterilized\".  The old place felt like walking into a family run pizza joint.  We have no plans to return to the new location for a family dinner.

Service was very poor tonight.  We must have had a new server.  She was not aware there even was a kids menu (another server helped after I complained about them taking it away).  We had to ask for garlic knots, tea was warm with little ice, ask for refills and plates. The other servers in our room took better care of us as they passed by.  I'm used to Dave stopping by to check on us.  Whoever was managing tonight was only seen standing in the hallway or not visible at all, and never smiling.  

The window shades did not provide ANY shade from the setting sun.  If you are offered a table in direct sunlight, refuse it.  It really put a damper on the ability for adults to converse.  More thought should have gone into this for a new location.

Food was still good!  It is the only good thing I can say for the place right now."}
{"text":"Visited Mario's again last week. We waited a second or two for a table and I got to hear the mgr. chastise the hostess about seating people. These people have no shame about putting down the staff in front of customers. I would hate to work for them. I've worked in food service before and it makes me not want to return just the way they treat their employees."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  We had the garlic knots to start with the wings as an appetizer.   The hot wings were good but I especially liked the sweet chili sauce.  They were part of the special which included a large pizza.  The pizza had a crispy crust and was cooked just right.  We did not sit in the bar but it looked like a great place to catch a game.  This was our first visit and we will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch after hearing how good it was. We were not impressed with the food. We were capable of eating it, but it was not NY pizza at all. It wasn't as bad as Dominos or Jets but we will not be back.

You know that feeling you get when you first see the pizza and you realize it is not going to taste good? That is exactly what happened. They must realize this happens so they don't have the pre-maid slices behind glass so you cant just walk out before ordering. I ordered some pepperoni slices and they just added the pepperoni to a cheese slice and heated it up. Not cool, it's not the same and you can taste the difference. 

This is what happens when you try new things, we'll stick with Tony's on Monroe Rd."}
{"text":"They served our group for prom and it was amazing, the food was excellent and the servers were so nice and helpful and made it so much better the back room was so nice and I would defiantly recommend the back room for large parties, the owner came in and checked on us multiple times and the servers were there to refill your drink fast as could be! Such a great expience and handled a large group so well!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner here last night! They did a beer night partnered with Great Lakes Brewing and I was blown away. I grew up going to Mario's and I always knew them as the place I go for great pizza and garlic knots. But they have stepped up their game! It was a tasting menu to match with the beer but also to show off what the chef cans do. First course was bacon wrapped shrimp which adding bacon is always a good thing and it was quite tasty! Second was a delicious salad featuring duck on top. Next we had some tasty bruschetta with smoked tomatoes and a balsamic reduction that really rounded out the favors! For the main course, we had a Cajun rubber pork tenderloin with a sauce made from the beer that the dish was being paired with along with a sort of au grated potatoes and asparagus. And for desert, we had creme brûlée with a Belgian chocolate sauce and raspberries. I've never had a creme brûlée with chocolate on it before but they nailed it. Overall great experience to really highlight for me that Mario's is a lot more than just great pizza and garlic knots!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and yummy salads! We've tried almost every pace here in Charlotte and Marios is by far the best."}
{"text":"$25 lunch with no service. 
The food here is great, I've been three times. But twice now, I've sat outside at lunch and been basically ignored. 

At lunch, you pay for your food at the counter when you order it, and the receipt has a tip line on it. I don't carry cash, so I either have to tip before I sit down or stiff them. Don't like that. 

I ordered a medium pizza for lunch, which was larger than I needed. I'm pretty big, and I only ate half of it. I should have ordered by the slice, but they didn't have the one I wanted that way. The pizza and a drink came to $22 and some change. With a reasonable tip, that's over $25 for one person to eat lunch. I thought that was kind of steep for a medium pizza.

They have a great patio, so I sat outside. The food came pretty quickly given that they had to make it. After they dropped off the pizza, I finished eating and had plenty of time to write this review and read several pages on Quora before she came back out (not to check on me) to clean off another table. That guy had come and been long gone in the time since I saw the waitress. I had long since finished my drink, never got a refill. I asked for a box, and that took another ten minutes. By this point, I was wishing I could give the tip to the cook and not the waitress.

Since this is the second time I've had this kind of experience, I probably won't be going back. Which is a shame, because the pizza tasted great. I've had their eggplant parm sandwich and it's really good.

All three times I've been there it was almost empty. I like the food, and the patio is nice. It's a shame the service is so bad."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have eaten there several times. Pizza is average, other dishes are good. Fast service, family atmosphere. A bit pricey compared to what is available in the area."}
{"text":"Wow is the pizza expensive!  When it is almost $20 for a pizza that would be called a \"medium\" at most places, I just can't given them a good review. It is not like it is best pizza either, it is average at best.  Not sure how they stay in business with the crazy prices they charge."}
{"text":"Went to Mario's last night for the first time, great food, great staff. The place is clean and everyone we met was friendly and helpful. Food was brought to the table in a timely manner and was hot and fresh, prices are reasonable and the portions are large, you have an option to order a half portion which is great. Will definitely be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food and good value! It's the place that my husband and I usually go for pizza. We've also ordered and had it delivered. It's always arrived quicker than they had stated on the phone."}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived nearby marios and John's place for years. The night we moved into our new house nine years ago, we celebrated with Marios pizza. These days we love Johns new location on weddington rd. We can order delivery or grab an evening to ourselves at Johns place to watch football games. The food and service is always warm, friendly and consistent. I know a lot of previous reviewers harp on the new location, but I commend John and his family for making such an investment in the matthews/ stallings community. We are grateful for their efforts, food, and sense of community. Keep up the good work. We will always be back."}
{"text":"We are giving this five star review because of Dave  Spinelli. He is an amazing Manager."}
{"text":"I went here for take out a few times when in the area. I think the pizza is awesome. Not sure what makes it so different from other pizzas (esp. chains). I think its a combination of perfect dough, fresh sauce and great tasting cheese. Definetely one of my favorite places to go for a quick slice of pizza when in Matthews."}
{"text":"Went to get takeout last night, we live very close so was shocked to find food cold, not lukewarm but COLD and garlic knots were old stale and hard, salad was hardly worth it, not happy at all, for something that a business like this should be able to do very easy, they failed.

We have eaten there a few times, I can honestly say, NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"The garlic knots taste like stale feet, much to my dismay because I love garlic anything. Pizza is good, not at all great. Would be open to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in the Charlotte Matthews area.  I have been looking for a place to make a Bismarck Pizza and the wonderful manager, Dave, seemed rather excited that we wanted one. It has prsciuto, mozarella, sauce and eggs on it.  Yes it is odd, but has become one of my families favorites from back in Detroit. The crust has great texture and flavor, exceptional sauce.  The Garlic Knots are absolutely delicious as is the fried ravioli appetizer.  Very reasonable prices for such a high quality special request pie!"}
{"text":"Ive been a customer for awhile. Ive never had a bad pizza. Most consistent pie in town! My other go to items are subs and  wings. Service has always been great. Of coarse prices could be cheaper but ive never herd of any restaurant ever lowering prices ha! 

Ps awesome cheese cake!"}
{"text":"Truly Amazing! Delicious food,nice staff! Great Italian food!Will definitely be back! Yum!"}
{"text":"For the life of me I want to support this place especially since they are so close but can't understand why they are so proud to charge $20 for a \"large pepperoni pizza\". I love pizza and would probably pay anything for a great one but sorry Mario, it's average at best. Their 2 slice lunch special is fair but that's it. Hopefully some day they will realize how much business they are losing with rediculous prices for so so quality and service."}
{"text":"Pizza sauce TOO salty, good crust.

Do order the garlic topping on your pizza it is of the jar
It's not fresh garlic it has an odd taste to it.
Also menu is overpriced."}
{"text":"First time here in what apparently is a new location -- completely disorganized, frazzled staff, HORRIBLE SERVICE, overpriced ($7 for a kids portion of Alfredo which had NO taste) The garlic rolls brought to the table were stone cold. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I used to come to Marios in the old location.  First time here.  Prices are ridiculously high
13 dollars for 10 wings?  Lasagna had some canned high salt sauce.  Its no wonder the place was empty at 1:00 pm on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Had take out and looked really nice inside.  We are new to the area and have tried some local pizza locations in hopes to find a gem.  Unfortunately the Pizza is not any better quality then dominos and twice the price.  I tried a pizza sub with pepperoni and unfortunately it was as then a layer of toppings on the sub as the pizza had.  I have no problem paying for higher quality but this first time doesnt give a reason to come back.  I dont think 30 dollars for a 8in sub and a medium two topping pizza is reassonable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I live 3 miles from it and I can tell you their appetizers their main courses their drinks the atmosphere can't beat it anywhere else."}
{"text":"Consistently great NY pizza!  I wish their health rating in the new location would stay above the 95 mark, which is very important to us. We do not dine at restaurants below that 95 mark and they just recently attained that rating.  
The good news is that they still
Have the same great pizza that we have been getting there for over a decade. One of they best we have ever eaten. 

I wish their parking had better lighting. It's a little scary at night."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  I really enjoy the Caesar Salad, linguini with white clam sauce, the garlic bread (not the knots), and the pizza. They have a nice wine selection and great cocktails.  The service is always great, with a special shout out to Liz, who is wonderful!! I don't work here and am not related to anyone at the restaurant! I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. I highly recommend Mario's!"}
{"text":"Local Pizza restaurant in Matthews, I sent my niece, daughter and little niece to eat and the staff was very rude! They had two servers and they seem discombobulated will never recommend this pizzeria to anyone in the neighborhood better off going to Jets Pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in NYC and I do deliveries all over the SE and very few pizza spots can give u an authentic NY style pizza. Mario's is definitely one of the few. I had the plain cheese pizza and it was great."}
{"text":"It's no frills but I like the food, the people are nice and it's right near where I live.  Plus, how can you go wrong with Pizza and Beer?"}
{"text":"I don't know if some of these reviewers were drunk when they wrote their reviews, but the food is very good. The sauce is NOT canned, it is homemade. The meal I had had lots of seasoning (chicken francese), but the chicken brocolini was a little bland because it was a lighter meal. They also give free yummy garlic knots!"}
{"text":"Hey Mario, this ain't Manhattan. It's Matthews NC. Cut us some slack on your prices. Last nights dinner was a large pizza with 1/2 sausage (can you slice the sausage any thinner?), 1 children's spaghetti and 4 sodas. $35 BEFORE tip! WTH? The food was good but geesh not $35 good.

Your pizza is good but it's not consistent. Last nights pizza was good. I would suggest asking for the pizza to be prepared well done on the bottom.

Your hoagies (not Subs) are good. But for the love of GOD please train your staff NOT to put Mayo on an Italian hoagie. If you were in NEPA you would be stoned in the town square for putting Mayo on an Italian hoagie.

Your entrees are OK. The side salads are very weak. 

The garlic knots are good and your service is fine. 

We would frequent more often if you weren't so pricey."}
{"text":"I don't know what to think.... food tasted good but was cold, they have a good wine selection, but you can tell those bottles have been opened for more than they should, service isn't bad, is just way way to slow... I just spend 100 bucks in a meal for two, and was not happy at all with the experience, I think that for those prices they need to better their game a lot"}
{"text":"Went for brunch.. AMAZING. They have the best bacon and their grits taste like the stone ground grits like they make in Charleston! They also make homemade donut holes that are out of this world!! Everything including the service was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"New location not an improvement.  Brick oven pizza was cold, baked ziti sorrentina was cold, garlic knots stale, new salad greens mix bitter.  Have to give them awhile to get back to their original quality before we go back."}
{"text":"Expensive for food that taste like nothing. I dont know if they forgot the sauce, ... The shrimps taste cheap."}
{"text":"When my wife and I moved to Mathews, we worried that we would never be able to replace our favorite Italian family restaurant back home. That's was until we ate at Mario's. Mario's has a great family atmosphere and the food is amazing. The Lasagna is so good that I sometimes order it in addition to the pizza, which is the best in town! If you're looking for a great family Italian restaurant, Mario's is a must! Friendly staff, good TV's, and the best Italian food around."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. Certainly not the best Italian restaurant in the area but then again there are not too many others to choose from.  The reason for the 2 star is the price make sure to bring your wallet if you come to this place...ordered a calzone with pepperoni and a \"full\" size Greek Salad and added grilled chicken breast to it. Ready for this......\"that will be $36 sir\". Ummm really???  The full size salad was $13 and the add chicken to it was $6 more. Sorry I will be spending my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been going to Marios for years.  Great Italian food and great people too. They put on a baby shower for us that was incredible.  They are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Marios consistently serves excellent food with fast and friendly service.  To start, the garlic knots with marinara are totally addictive as another reviewer has pointed out! 

 If you are in the mood for something light, go with a salad and a slice.  My fav salad is the Mescalun (with candied walnuts, dried cranberry, and goat cheese with Italian dressing).  For the slice, I usually get chicken with mushrooms and black olives - but you can choose whatever you like.  The crust is just right - not too thick, not too thin. The sauce is good and the pizza is never greasy.  

But, if you are in the mood for something a little \"heavier\", they have excellent pasta and other traditional Italian entrees.  A couple of my favs here are the Eggplant parmesan, Chicken Marsala, and Seafood Fra Diavlo.  Also excellent is the Spinach Stuffed Shells!  The entrees come with a salad and garlic knots and are large enough to have leftovers to take home, which is a nice bonus!  This is one of my fav go-to places for a great meal at a great value."}
{"text":"Mario's is our long lost Italian restaurant of choice in the Queen City. After living in the northeast for several years and moving down south, we were hard pressed to find authentic Italian. When we moved to Matthews we came upon Mario's and have been happy. It's a great place for families and the staff even took the time to entertain our rambunctious kids. We've ordered take out and the quality is just  as good. The only negative is that it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the others that have given such glowing review of this place had drank before dinner.  My wife and I were just here for a St. Patricks Day Dinner Date, it was bland, and canned.  The best part of the meal was the mints on the way out.  Chicken Parm was frozen with canned sauce, lasagna was floating in grease, again with canned sauce.  Garlic Bread and cheese was ok, but the sauce was once again canned.  The food surrounding us for the other diners had no aroma, plating was messy.  No seasoning, bland.

Wait staff was fast and attentive, shameful that their tips will suffer due to the food quality and taste.  The menu had many items to choose from, both American Bar Food and Italian, but not sure that we can go back for a second chance,  Not a chance this is the best pizza in charlotte."}
{"text":"This restaurant is way too expensive for the quality of the food.  It is just a regular pizza joint. Nothing special. The pizza isn't that good but the prices are  that of a high end restaurant.  There are much better pizza options in the Blakeney Shopping center."}
{"text":"We recently relocated to the area and several people had told us to try this restaurant. We finally decided to check it out. The entire experience was a pleasure, the staff is very attentive, the food comes out in a well timed manner, and everyone in our party really enjoyed everything from the appetizers all the way to desert. We will be going back for sure!!! Highly recommend the place! I have dinned at much higher priced restaurant and this one really hits it out of the park and it's not too bad price wise either."}
{"text":"For all those who left previous reviews expressing dissatisfaction, I'm in agreement with you!! Food was mediocre at best, water tasted terrible and couldn't even get anyone to refill any of our family's drinks. Husband finally had to ask for more water, and person saw that mine was also empty and didn't even bother to refill it or even ask!! Unbelievably poor service and prices were ridiculous. Especially for a kid's spaghetti that was the size of a saucer to be $9. And speaking of that, who doesn't have a kid's menu??"}
{"text":"We were excited about trying their advertised double pork chop. We got sat down in a nice booth eager to try the food and we waited... and waited.. It took about 20 min before someone came around to take our drink order. and we waited.... and waited... Finally got our drinks and the waitress took our order for appetizers and meal. The wings and Arancini. Both good. Then came our main meal. I had the Seafood Arrabbiata (1/2 order) and my hubs had the double pork-chop, specifically ordered as well done.  The pasta dish was ok. Nothing special, overcooked shrimp and barely there clams. The scallops were cooked well, but the calamari was rubbery. The double porkchop was beautiful on the outside, but when hubs cut into it was raw. Waitress took back and came back a few minutes later with still under-cooked pork (this time it was pink, with a bit of raw) The second trip back to the kitchen with it and finally a manager asked, where is your chop? Told her we sent it back again and she flitted away. 3rd time was a charm and the chop was finally cooked to order. Although by this time I had nearly finished my pasta & keep in mind we got no refills on beverages offered to us either. The waitress was very apologetic, but surely the manager who came by the table and took our check would have apologized as well and even offer to take something off the bill??? Nope! The meal for both of us including one cocktail was nearly 75$ too. High prices, bad service. Sorry Mario's I really wanted to like this meal, but no joy."}
{"text":"We wanted to have some good Italian food and enjoy our date night and that is exactly what we did! Gambino's Shrimp Scampi appetizer, Chicken Picatta, some wine and Coconut Cake for dessert...a couple of cannoli's to take home and we are STUFFED! Tish was our fabulous server this evening and she did a great job  Thank you Mario's for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Seriously the best New York style pizza I have ever had. We have been going here for years and it is consistently great. They deliver but for a fee. It isn't cheap pizza but worth it. We were initially concerned that it might go downhill with moving locations, but it is still great. I really like that they actually COOK their pizza until it is done, not just until the cheese melts. Awesome."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for dinner. I had veal picatta she had shrimp picatta.. The sauce tasted way different when we sampled each other's food.. Mine tasted like they put way to much lemon in the sauce . Was not to impressed. Her picatta sauce much better. For 19 dollars a dinner and not even bread on the table or a small side salad . We will not be back. To expensive for what it was and that was just ok food at the most."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian find ! Located on Matthews Weddington Road with delivery to Weddington! 
I ordered via phone and food was delivered hot and promptly... actually earlier than expected!
I order the Pasta Ziti Sorentina with Shrimp. The order came with 3 delicious garlic knots !
Delicious! Mingia  ! Bona Tali !"}
{"text":"Great food I had a 20 oz prime rib. It was delicious and tender.  My wife had spinach stuffed shells. Have good choice on the menu.  Service was great. This is the second time we went there and we will go there in the future. This will be one of our favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Best Calamari I've ever had in my life. And I am an Italian Brian in Brooklyn and have eaten it all my life. WOW!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am on the area I always stop in. Great Italian sub. Great atmosphere and super nice people."}
{"text":"My oldest sister lives really close to Mario's and we used to order all the time, till we discovered Tony's has much better pizza.  But on Friday I found myself too lazy to drive and pick up the pizza so delivery from Mario's it was!

I had pizza the day before so I ordered pizza for my nephews, a stromboli for my dad, who definitely does not need to be eating that and the chicken marsala for me.  It comes with a salad and over spaghetti and a side of garlic knots, its really too much food.

Delivery was much quicker then they estimated.  As I remembered the pizza didn't look good, its just too saucy and not a good sauce either.  But a 3 and 6 y/o could care less and they devoured it.  My dad complained that they didn't make a stromboli properly and he would never get that from there again.  I knew what to expect with mine, its not an extraordinary chicken marsala, but it hits the spot when you have a craving plus it was enough to provide me with leftovers for lunch the next day.

Overall, I would probably not rush back to order Mario's again.  I prefer Tony's pizza and when I want other Italian dishes I have a few other favorites around Charlotte."}
{"text":"My husband called in for pick up. We got pizza and salad. Pizza was good. However, I am appalled at the salad. The lettuce was completely wilted with brown on the edges. It really was gross and yet they charge a fortune for a very poor, disgusting, unservable salad. I don't know why we continue purchasing it?"}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good prime rib place for quite awhile and....FOUND IT!! For a mere $25 you get a pile of mouth watering garlic knots, mashed potatoes, veggie and 20 ounces of melt in your mouth beef goodness cooked to absolute perfection. The rasmopolitan was also excellent. Great atmosphere and fantastic service! Thank you, we will be back!"}
{"text":"For us, Mario's is our favorite delivery pizza choice. 

In our experience, the young girls who take your order have a hard time hearing you over the phone (it's quite loud in the restaurant); but once you get past that, you're good to go.

I despise chains and cheap-o pizza (Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's etc) and love Mario's. It tastes very \"New York\" to me, but is not quite as crispy as a good NYC slice. I recommend Mario's White Pizza, it is delicious. Also recommended in the entree category: the Baked Ziti Sorentina. 

However - beware of their salads... their Greek salad is a joke for $8.99. It should be more like $5.99 for the size and ingredients.

I definitely think that Mario's a bit overpriced no matter what you get... c'mon $35.00 for two (simple) pizzas? (one medium, one large). It's a bit much. 

I don't believe we have ever had any issues with delivery. In our experience it always arrives quickly and is usually still piping hot. 
We happily pay the $1 or $2 delivery fee - even though we live within walking distance of the \"other Mario's\" in Matthews, in Matthews Festival. 

I guess the fact is, in the Charlotte area, we are deprived of really great pizza, especially those places that deliver, so Mario's fits the bill quite nicely. It's not perfect, but it will do for now.

~"}
{"text":"Lived close by for almost 10 years.  Outstanding NY style pizza available for delivery.  Excellent service and great pizza.  Not a $10 Pizza Hut special so don't compare it.  Recommend."}
{"text":"Family owned & operated (big fan of supporting these!), Mario's offers choices.  The menu includes pizzas (stuffed & deep dish too), sausage rolls, pastas galore, salads, burgers, subs, etc....and a plethora of what looked like really good desserts.  Casual place to take kids, especially when you want to watch a game.  They have HDTV'S.  

We ordered a couple slices of cheese pizza (very good flavor) and a couple of subs (a turkey & an Italian-#3) per their recommendation.  Hard to beat these when you can order it your way.  The only complaint...the provolone was left off of one.   

Dine indoors/outdoors, pick up, order on line, have it delivered, or catered.

Adults looking for something a little more upscale???  Visit John's Place next door.  They serve Mario's anytime the bar is open!"}
{"text":"They have moved locations which is just right down the street and in their very own building!!  The place looks great and the service is awesome!!  The employees make you feel at home and they look like they love their job.  Very positive vibe!!  The owner John and manager Dave definitely have come a long way and it shows how much pride and care they put into their business and how much they value their customers. It's always nice to get food delivered by these guys but we love the new place so much, its worth to get out and dine in!!  Wishing them the best!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy eating here and have made it our go to place on weeknights we do not want to cook. You cannot beat the prices for meals, especially the nightly food and drink specials. The one downside to the place is that their menu is extensive and it is hard to figure out what to order. They recently have raised their prices about ~$1-$2 but still a great value. The service has been great each time we have gone there and drinks refilled before the glass was empty."}
{"text":"We order pizza from here occasionally as delivery when we've had an extra long day at work and are too tired to pick up at our favorite pizza place that does not deliver.  Pizza is very very salty. I eat it knowing that 
I'll have to get up in the middle of the night and gulp down a couple glasses of water. Prices are high for slightly above average quality. We're also thinking that the size of pizzas has gotten smaller as it doesn't seem to go as far as it used to? So it's our in a pinch pizza/pasta place...not our happy happy joy joy pizza/pasta place."}
{"text":"One year later I have to say that I feel compelled to update my previously poor rating.  Mario's has gotten it together and aside from a few hiccups, food and service has been vastly improved. The service is quicker, and new menu additions are superb. ( I held back one star because recently we placed a pizza order and what was delivered was clearly a \"not fresh\" pizza...hell lets just say it - someone decided to box up an old pizza and deliver it...now when I order I specifically ask for a pizza made to order and it's been fine)"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Mario's and for the most part, have always had good food and service.  I have not ordered from them for awhile and either they had a really off night, or they have really gone downhill.  We had a relative come in town and we all thought Italian good would be nice. I called in an order for pick up and was \"greeted\" on the phone by a very uninterested male who didn't even bother to fake interest in customer service. Honestly, I should have hung up and gone elsewhere. I went to pick it and it was ready on time (hence the 2 rather than 1 star) Their food is not cheap, and my relative paid (even tipped!!) and I could not have been more embarrassed when we got home and opened the bag.  A lot of the food had leaked out of their containers because they were not sealed well (despite being held upright the whole way home) The lasagna piece was minuscule, the salads were measly, the spaghetti and meat sauce was good, but greasy. The bread was pretty hard. Very sad dinner.  The great thing about Charlotte is that we have a lot of good food option and there is no need to frequent inconsistent restaurants. Sadly, Mario's is now off my list."}
{"text":"We went here for Sunday brunch with Grandpa, Grandma, and the kids. It was absolutely delicious. I'm visiting from San Francisco, where just the concept of parking is a luxury, but the service and food here is so good I had to review it before I flew home.

We had a room pretty much to ourselves at first (we were a pretty early group), but the server took really good care of us. When a member of our party wasn't delighted with her drink, the server let her share my bottomless-Bellini order (it helps that neither of us is much of a drinker!). The kids loved the garlic knots, and they got more of both knots and sauce promptly, without asking twice. 

Our party ordered a mix of lunch and brunch dishes, but the brunch dishes were AMAZING. I had the Bourbon Street mac & cheese, and two days later I'm still longing for it. We ordered donut holes for the table: they were so light and warm and tender. They were dusted with cinnamon sugar and something else, something bright and almost fruity. You could taste the butter in the sauce. That's what brunch should taste like. That's love.

The next time I visit my sister in Matthews, I bet we won't be able to get a reservation here. Go while you can still get in, and take the kids. Everyone will thank you for it!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite family resturant. Food is great, service is always perfect and the atmosphere allows us to bring our children on a regular basis. Thanks John for making this our neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Awful restaurant. This place is a waste of your time and money. My family just dinned at their new location (they just moved from up the road). We spent an incredibly high sum for what we got. They bring out cold bread balls with some scalding marinara in a plastic cup. The host seemed offended when we inquired about a kids menu. The server was borderline rude. The portion of pasta they brought our five year old was more than a grown man could eat and priced that way too. This place is soooo ridiculously high for the gross pizza buffet quality food they serve. 
They got the first and last dollars they will be getting from us."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I usually get the 2 slice pizza special that comes with a drink for under $6, and then add an order of garlic knots (which are irresistible). Pizza is always good, and it's a great local family owned business."}
{"text":"The pizza here isn't really NY style or Chicago style, its just pizza, but it's delicious.  I went here for dinner and some drinks with my best friend.  I was overwhelmed by how scrumptious the cheese pizza was; it was loaded with cheese and tangy sauce and it wasn't greasy like most of the restaurants that serve pizza around here.  

The bar is smoke free and even though I do smoke, I thought this was a refreshing change.  The owner Mr. Fechellio came out to check on us during our meal, and shot a few jokes our way.  It is a family place, and Fecellio's family all have jobs here.  Great Italian dining experience overall."}
{"text":"Best pizza joint I've found since moving from New England.  The only New York Style pizza I've found down here...great sauce and the slice makes that \"perfect fold\"!  It's a great change from the typical sweet sauce and thick fluffy dough that I usually encounter.  It will be my go to for pizza from now on."}
{"text":"Great location, good parking, clean, cheery & has food to please my whole family. I like the Greek salad. My husband and kids like the pizza. Pick-up service side-entrance works fast.  You can also wait at the bar, and they will deliver pick-up there. Dining in is pleasant as well. Glad to have a tasty neighborhood pizza place!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and got the eggplant parm meal - for $8 it was a lot of food and quick, so that's a + for sure. The garlic knots served were overly chewy, and the marinara served with it was ok but nothing spectacular. The salad was crisp but the ceasar dressing lacked a distinct taste. The eggplant dish was where they really lost points - the eggplant was cut so thin it was more like eating fried breadcrumbs. I'll try these guys again since it was quick, ample portions and priced well but I would suggest they work on their sauce and prep more!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Jersey and knowing what real pizza is- we highly recommend this place.  Best margarita pizza in Charlotte.  My husband and I drive all the way from Steele Creek area for their pizza."}
{"text":"We celebrated Mother's Day here this year and had the Prime Rib Special.  It was amazing!  We enjoy the community atmosphere and when we think Italian we think Mario's."}
{"text":"My family loves Mario's!  We eat there all the time, love the food and always have great service!"}
{"text":"Great wine selections. Watch the specials for a really good steak. Wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best Italian food around. The chicken parm special during the week is loaded with chicken, enough for 2. Good drink options and super kid friendly. My kids love the pizza and garlic knots."}
{"text":"DOES THIS ADD UP?  No matter how I figure my charges on my receipt it doesn't add up.  I run a business in the same county and know my accounting, but maybe I'm missing something.  I'll throw the numbers out there and if there's a savvy accountant that can make sense of it.... PLEEZE let me know.  As written on actual receipt / 1 Eggplant Parm. $12.00 & $1.00 Delivery Charge, Sub Total - $15.00 + Tax $1.01 + Grat/GC/SVC 1.00, Total $17.01. Tax is 6.75% here.  No matter how I arrange these numbers they don't add up.  I gave the Delivery Person $5 (they work hard and deserve it).  Am I missing something?  My meal was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. I have eaten here several times and the food is always excellent."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte! The Margherita pizza is my favorite, but my runner-up is the cheese pizza with meatballs. Atmosphere is great for dining in, but it's also super convenient that they also have a drive-through for good food on the go."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst pizza I've ever had. Any grocery store frozen pizza would have been better. Service okay, though."}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was decent. Now it's become awful. Tasteless dishes and drinks and way over priced. Everyone around the area thought we were finally going to get some good pizza but this palace turned into a waste of time and money. Think of it as Papa Johns or a Dominos Pizza with an expanded menu and costs 3x as much."}
{"text":"if you are a vegetarian do not eat from here; my body cannot handle meat. if you like to eat your food clean, don't eat here. my pasta was cooked in a dirty dish i found pieces of pork mixed in."}
{"text":"Mario ' s has become our go to place for casual Italian. It's a bit out of our way but well worth it.  The new location has a well thought out design. Several small rooms rather than just one big one. The decor is clean and attractive. The staff is top notch. Very professional with just the right touch of warm and friendly. Every meal we have tried has been excellent.  Well.prepared, very tasty, and nice big portions. You won't leave hungery. The prices are very reasonable too. We'll be back often."}
{"text":"I just tried again and ordered a chicken cutlet parm hero. Fail.  The chicken cutlet is cut up and dry. French fries were super soggy and  thrown in with catchup packets. Unsanitary to say the least. I really wish they would get it together. I hate to give it 2 stars,  but I  won't be going back, sorry to say. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"We've only had pizza (numerous times) and it's always been excellent. A few times the garlic knots have been a little over done. We've usually ordered delivery, as we have small children. Definitely our favorite in the area."}
{"text":"Had lunch delivered to my apartment complex. The food was great. I had Spaghetti Alfredo with broccoli and a Greek salad.  The Greek salad was so tasty - I'll definitely order it again. The spaghetti was good also.  I loved how it came with garlic knots. I also appreciated the pleasant person who took my order over the phone and the nice delivery person. Good experience overall and the quality of the food was great! Happy to have found this place.

Over the weekend, I ordered a medium veggie  pie which was also very good. I do have to say that I find them to be expensive. My spaghetti Alfredo dish was $15 and the medium pie was $22.  This might become a \"special occasion\" place to order from."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm from Chicago and we stopped here for pizza! I thought, okay, here we go!

Let me tell you I was not disappointed. The sauce was wonderful and they serve these cute \"garlic knots\" bread to dip in sauce before they serve your meal. Have to recommend the ham & cheese sub-the bread was wonderful and crunchy and the ham was carved not processed.

The waitresses were all cute/personable high school girls. Also, they have outdoor seating! (a plus, when you come from the \"windy city\"!)"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss with pizza. The pizza at it's best is only okay, but when they miss, they really miss. I ordered a large pizza with sausage. My kids had to ask if they cooked the crust. It was a disgusting, doughy mess. I also ordered a large pizza with chicken, black olives and green peppers. Despite clarifying that I simply wanted grilled chicken breast and NOT buffalo chicken, they still sent me buffalo chicken ... with ranch dressing all over it. Barf! To top it off, this pizza wasn't cheap ... $53.17 to be exact, including a $3.00 delivery fee. I think the delivery fee is new and it made me not want to tip the delivery guy. I gave him $5 bucks. So, $58 total for two pies that no one wants to eat. Its time for Mario's to close."}
{"text":"I have lived in the neighborhood across the street from Mario's for 8 years now, but just now getting around to writing a review.  If you asked me 5 years ago about this place, I would have rated it 2 or 3 stars.  However, I'm pretty sure they tweaked the recipe to their pizza, and it's now my favorite pizza in Charlotte.  

Overall, I think the prices are fair, but I do think $1.75 per topping is a little steep.  If you eat there, the complementary garlic knots make up for it a little.  I would say 80% of the time, the garlic knots are cooked to perfection (warm and doughy), but the other 20% of the time, they have been luke warm and a little stale.  They will swap them out for fresh knots if you ask nicely, however.  

Not sure if anyone has seen that Family Guy episode where they poke fun of \"Every Pizza Place\" and how they ruin a salad, but Mario's is slightly guilty of this.  The salad being put in a lasagna tray on top of a hot pizza box is not uncommon.  I don't eat at Mario's for the salads, so no big deal for me.  

My main recommendation would be to change around the draft beer selection every once in awhile.  They've had the same draft beer for as long as I can remember.  The only thing they seem to rotate is the Sam Adams seasonal.  They keep the beer on the \"John's Place\" side, which is a bar owned by the same guy who own's Mario's.  The cool thing is there is a small hallway connecting the two establishments, so you can always decide to go sit in a more adult friendly area (no kids allowed in John's Place).

One final kudos ... fantastic fried pickles and above average chicken wings."}
{"text":"Overall, I really enjoy this place. I've loved that it has drive thru window and that has primarily been how I've visited. My take out orders were always delicious and hot still by the time I got home. Made it really easy to pick up a good dinner for my family after work.

I took my dad here this past Sunday, and inside the restaurant, I was not really that impressed. Our waiter was okay, but not that attentive. We came pretty late in the day, so it wasn't busy. My one complaint is the TV situation for the booth seating. You CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. No point in having football on if only tables across the restaurant can see it. They have these huge round table lights that obstruct both TVs on both ends of the restaurant. No matter which way you turned, you could see a corner at best - and our table was right by the TV. This appeared to be the case for all booth seating. I'd suggest moving the TVs, or take down the lights. It just made it really frustrating to have the game on, but not being able to see it when you're sitting right there under it."}
{"text":"Mario's is poor; it has been for a long time.   They run Joe's Place too.   Same deal.   Owner doesn't care.   Go to Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"Met my wife out for lunch last week here. It was about 1:30ish and there were only a few people in the place so we were seated right away. I went with one of the lunch specials, 2 slices & a drink for $6. Not a bad deal. The slices were good size and filled me up. My wife ordered directly off the menu. She had a salad with grilled chicken. She loved the chicken, but her salad & a drink was close to $12. A little pricey for lunch. I'd go back for the lunch special again."}
{"text":"This review is a long time coming.  We've eaten there several times, but it's the takeout pizza that keeps us coming back!  Food is consistently hot and great!  yes, it's more expensive.  If you want cheap, there's those chain pizza places.  If you want a pizza that tastes like it was made with real ingredients and fresh, you can't go wrong here.  When the kids are away and wife and I want pizza, we get takeout margarita pizza and it's probably the best in town."}
{"text":"Solid place, good quality food with a typical Italian menu.  Gotta say the Garlic Knots are addicting. The pizza is good. The sauce is not spicy or lumpy just good solid pizza sauce.  I've had a couple different things here and they all have been good.

A solid local restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times and have not been disappointed.  The staff is outstanding no matter what time you walk through the door.  The food is always good no matter what part of the menu you order from.  Good daily specials.  You have to try the prime rib on Saturdays.  The folks here are truly interested in getting it right and making sure you are satisfied.  Oh yeah, probably the coldest tap beer I've had in a long time.  Good selection too."}
{"text":"This is probably my FAVORITE Italian restaurant in the Charlotte Metro area!! I have been twice and everything thing from the food, to the service to the quaint little fountain outside is superb!!  Everything is home made with the freshest ingredients! Stop by and say hi to Liz - she is an amazing server, really sweet and a wonderful personality!  Oh and make sure and try the spinach/artichoke dip! It's to die for!!"}
{"text":"Small slice and good ny style but this is the best place to order pizza with toppings the perfect slice but expensive."}
{"text":"Garlic knots greet you after you've found your seat at this quaint pizza joint.  They've got a decent beer selection, but would love to see them add a few Italian brews on tap.  Meatballs (we ordered as an app for my son) are also good, and would be fantastic on a freshly baked submarine sandwich bun.

Great teasers for the 'Za.  Fresh dough, fresh toppings, and the sauce is a hint on the sweet side, which isn't my cup of tea, but it's still delish.  I would love to see them figure out how to crisp up my pepperoni, but they're not stingy with the toppings so I'm not complaining.

My one complaint however is an important one - it's expensive!  This place is easily as expensive as Hawthornes, if not more so.  Side of meatballs, large pizza with 'roni and fungus = $26?  Yikes!  That was just for take out too, forget about adding on two $5 beers... If they knocked down the price tag by about 15%?  not only would their yelp rating improve, but they'd have loyal brand advocates all over south Charlotte."}
{"text":"Yes, the food is pretty traditional and not always the kind you would find on a show on the Food Network - but it is damn good and pretty damn consistent. Not to mention that the people are awesome and honestly make the experience memorable. From the bar to the wait staff, the fun personalities of these lovely people are great. It is exactly what a person would want from a neighborhood bar/restaurant and more. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very good NY style pizza. They have plenty more on the menu, but we usually stick to pizza and salad. I've eaten here many times and it is consistently good. The garlic knots are now free as an appetizer and they are a family favorite."}
