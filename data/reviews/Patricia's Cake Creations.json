{"text":"Would definitely recommend getting your cake done here! Ordered a cake for my good friends birthday and it was wonderful! They made me a red velvet cake with a vanilla cream filling it was so moist and delicious I've never had such a delicious cake in my life! Thank you Patricia and your team for creating such a beautiful and tasteful cake! 
( definitely will be getting my wedding cake make here )"}
{"text":"We ordered a wedding cake from Patricia and it exceeded our expectations. Everything from the taste to the look to the service was outstanding. Patricia really knows what she is doing! We ordered 3 different flavours for our cake - vanilla with strawberry cream, chocolate with raspberry cream, and mocha with dulce de leche. She accommodated 3 flavours for 3 layers with no additional cost. The cream was made with fresh fruit and you could really taste the difference. We opted with sugar flowers as decoration and the orchids and hydrangeas she crafted were beautiful. We would highly recommend Patricia to anyone looking for a beautiful and delicious cake for any occasion. We hope to order again from you soon :)"}
{"text":"I recently picked up 2 dozen cupcakes for my son's birthday party. 
They were fantastic !  
The cupcakes were nicely decorated and the butter cream was excellent.  
You can pre-order, or just go into the shop and pick up the flavors they have out that day.  
I did not pre-order and managed to get a good variety that the kids and adults all loved.
My sister said the vanilla lemon cupcake was the best cupcake she ever tried in her life. 
Only thing is they are not nut free if someone has a nut allergy."}
{"text":"Picked up a dozen cupcakes, buttercream frosting. 
So good ordered a cake picked up today. Red velvet with vanilla delicious. 
Friendly helpful service. 
Has a coffee espresso bar as well. 
Next time."}
{"text":"2.5*

Came here for Macaron Day and ended up buying half a dozen more besides the free one I got. It wasn't until we went elsewhere that we realized that was a bit of a mistake. Don't get me wrong, they tasted good. But they were small, expensive ($2.35 each) and not as good as many other bakeries I've tried. Maybe I'm spoiled from living right by Patisserie 27 but I definitely wished I'd picked up more at places besides here.

The store was nice, the staff friendly, and the cake samples looked pretty cool. I imagine actual cakes are their specialty so I wouldn't judge them too harshly on this experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best!!! My husband and I used Patricia's for out wedding cake and it was to die for!!! She was the first cake vendor we visited and booked her on the spot! The cake was not only beautiful and delicious but also affordable as well! We still get compliments two years later! We couldn't wait to eat the top layer at our first anniversary! I loved her
Cakes so much i ordered the same one for my husbands birthday :) start to finish the process was easy, we were beyond happy!"}
{"text":"I know this review is late, but better late than never. Go back to November 2012, I was driving home and saw Patricia's Cake Creations on Dundas. Sign said coming soon. I was looking for that special birthday cake and did not know who to turn to. I called the number and spoke with Patricia herself. I advised what I needed and she stated that she would make the cake and I could pick it up from the store, even though they were not officially open yet. Wow what service. My partner was celebrating a Milestone and turning 50. A 50 year old but young at heart and addicted to \"Angry Birds\". Needless to say, the cake was delivered as promised and was the most fun AND delicious cake I have ever had. If you need that Special Occasion Cake, I highly recommend Patricia's. see the picture as proof!"}
{"text":"Patricia and her mom are a pleasure to work with! My fiance and I planned a wedding that took place in Toronto, all the way from Miami. We met Patricia only one time and did everything else over the phone and email and she was very accommodating (even throughout my whole back and forth confusion as to weather or not we wanted a wedding cake or macaron tower). Not only was she willing to bring to life every single cake I showed her a picture of, but she made ours gluten free!! And let me tell you...it tasted phenomenal. We chose vanilla cake with vanilla frosting and none of our guests were disappointed. While traditionally you are supposed to cut the bigger cake and save the top, we just could not cut into the beautiful hand painted flowers, so we ate the top and saved the other tier. Thank you so much for adding one of many sweet touches to our special day!!"}
{"text":"Patricia created a little assortment of sweets to serve our clients at an event we held while we were in Toronto...and...oh my goodness...they were so delicious it it took all my willpower not to eat all the cupcakes myself! The cake was soft and moist and the buttercream was literally melt in your mouth! If you are looking to impress your party guests with a treat that is beautiful AND TASTES as good as it looks, then you cannot go wrong with Patricia's!"}
{"text":"Patricia did a phenomenal job with my cake. I gave her a Pinterest photo and said could you replicate this?! Did she ever! Her attention to detail was amazing! She matched the exact flowers that were in my wedding! Patricia was a pleasure to work with! She asked my family if we wanted any coffee, espresso and took great care of us!

For our wedding, she even customized a tier for us-Dark chocolate cake with salted caramel icing. The other tier was madagascar vanilla icing and red velvet cake. This was not your normal vanilla, this was real vanilla bean. The cake that she served us for the tasting was great, but for our wedding was even better if you can imagine!

I cannot express how amazing my cake was and working with Patricia. I will definitely contact her if I have another event!"}
