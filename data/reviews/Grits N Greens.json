{"text":"Great Southern Food. First time trying we enjoyed the mac-n-cheese, turkey and gravy and broccoli casserole. The green beans are out of this world!!! The tea was good and the place was clean. We look forward to trying their breakfast."}
{"text":"Waited 45 min for two breakfast plates...a short stack and a short stack with bacon and eggs. A number of people were served faster and some even slower. When food arrived, the eggs and bacon weren't hot. My bill charged a different amount than shown on the menu. This is my second and last visit since this restaurant became Grits N Greens."}
{"text":"The first time I went was amazing! I'm a server myself so I notice a lot. I had the meatloaf, cucumber and tomatoes, stewed cabbage and added the pickled beets for my daughter who had the chicken tenders with rice and gravy. The meatloaf was amazing, cucumber&tomatoes amazing and the pickled beets to die for (they must make them themselves.) the service was great even though it was busy too! It cost only $15 so overall I was just thrilled with my experience.

I raved so much about it that my mother and I (with my daughter of course) decided to go on a Friday evening. This time was not as great. I was surprised to find it not so busy. The server was kind of blank faced, statuesque almost. She asked if we were ready several times and the last time within a minute of the time before. We ordered our app to kinda appease her (fried green tomatoes. They were okay) Like I said, as a server I know what I do for my customers and appreciate good service. She was there to simply do a job. Another server ended up getting us boxes and such. My mother ordered the meatloaf which came in a huge portion but most of it was burnt sides and sorta dry. I had the chopped steak with mashed potatoes and green bean casserole (casserole of the day) Potatoes were okay. The green bean casserole wasnt so much a casserole and wasn't that great. Soupy almost. But the most disappointing was the chopped steak which was essentially a burger patty with barely cooked onions and green peppers on top.

I'll probably go back again. I just hope it's more like the first time and not so much like the second time!!"}
{"text":"Traveling down 85 looking for something different. We try to support small local owned businesses when possible. This was a good choice. 
1 had the 1/4 white meat chicken ( a breast w attached wing) with the collard greens & a side of tomato w cucumber mix.  The chicken was perfectly cooked. Tender, juicy with a delicious crunch. The collard greens were good. He didn't like the tomato/cucumber mix & after trying it is agree. It was basic mix in Italian dressing, but the tomatoes were too soft & not good.
1 had the chicken fried steak. It looked great & must have been because there was not a speck left, not even a crumb from the Texas toast. He had a side of mac & cheese and green beans. He said both were really good. 
1 had the baked spaghetti. It was a big plate of food. He liked it, just couldn't finish it.
1 had the sunrise hamburger. We all laughed when it came because there was no way he could fit that thing in his mouth... but he did. It's a 1/2 pound burger so it's big!  He liked it, said the meat was good. 
Overall the food was fresh, quicker than expected (because they were jammin when we came in) & we all left happy that we chose that over a chain restaurant. Happy to support & we would come again if passing this way. Enjoy!

{"text":"The food and service was awesome. I had the Cajun pork chops and the seasoning was just right. All the sides were great and for desert the strawberry pie was \" wow \".
The prices were very good, my first time there, definitely not the last."}
{"text":"Went to Grits n Greens this Friday morning to chat with friends over coffee n breakfast. Thank goodness we were in no hurry LOL... Food was great, no complaints. I had the BLT with egg and peaches... Waitresses were on point... hopefully they can speed those cooks up a bit, we were in there forever!"}
{"text":"Cute little town with home cooking and daily specials.  7.99 got a meat and two sides plus tea.  Excellent service.  The food was so so, the beef stew was too salty to enjoy or eat all of it, it was tender.  The collards were spiced and vinegar seasoned and tender, but not that good.  The cornbread was mega sweet and heavy, one bite... skip the cornbread.   Hopefully it was just one off meal, will give it another try.  Again great staff."}
{"text":"They had great vegetarian options the day I went. The pinto beans were ok. The real surprise was the Pineapple casserole... it was absolutely delicious!!!! The fries were really good as was the shrimp quesadilla. If ever in the area, I would definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Home cooking and great prices with excellent customer service! I will be back! Be sure to try the Southern Egg roll!"}
{"text":"Service:  Really good. Very friendly. No issues with this.

Food:  Well, there are some issues.  

Food:  Mac n Cheese:  Ok flavor.  Its overcooked. Flavor was ok.. but not great.  Meatloaf was way over worked. Texture had issues.  Not a great flavor. It was very, very greasy and the ketchup was not caramelized.  It wasn't a good meatloaf.  Gravy was flavorless really.  Cornbread: It had good flavor, but it was VERY small.  Overall it was just ok. Nothing to write home about. 

Overall, I don't think I will return.  Its a miss to me with the food!"}
{"text":"Large seating area and friendly staff. Great breakfast with good omelets and gravy better than most. Really good coffee and wait staff is on top of their job. Have excellent lunch selection and one of the best burgers in the county! Burger is cooked to order and hand made.   All around great place to eat southern food...."}
{"text":"The food, service and lunch prices are 5 stars! Good variety. Only negative is it is very loud during busy times. The best choice for food in the area by far!"}
{"text":"OK, so here is why I give 5 stars.  Service, service, service.  If you come here, ask for Savannah.  She is the cute girl with black glasses and a wonderful smile.  She was attentive, but didnt bother me. Gave me plenty of time to choose what I wanted and gave some advice on what is good.  My favorite part, after ordering the Collard Greens, was that she actually asked if I take my greens with vinegar...AND if I wanted pepper vinegar.  Freaking awesome.  Normally I have to go out of my way to get someone to find the old pepper vinegar bottle tucked away somewhere, but Savannah was on it!  Thanks for a great lunch experience. 

The food is good, not outstanding, not your mammaw's sunday supper, but its good.  Its fast, well priced, and hearty.  The gravy on my country steak came from a can, but other than that everything else was completely finished from my plate."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time for some lunch. It was pretty good! Our waitress, Brandy was very nice and sweet. She let us sample the pineapple casserole and it was very, very good. I ordered the meatloaf special with macaroni and cheese and fried okra. The mac and cheese didn't honeslty do much for me, but the rest of the food was really good. I tried my friends gravy that she ordered and it was very bland. Food was SUPER cheap though- for both me and my friend it was $13, which you definitely can't beat. I plan on coming back to this place so I can try their breakfast food too :)"}
{"text":"On the surface, this seems like a southern diner, local staple establishment. They serve a lot of regionally popular dishes, but not at any great quality. It seems popular with locals, but I can't for the life of me figure out why. None of the food I've had there seems like it would be worth coming back for. It can also get rather loud when it's more than a handful of diners."}
{"text":"Decent food, decent service. Close to home so convenience is the key. Really nice folks that work there but sometimes they seem completely in the weeds even when the place isn't that crowded. We usually go for breakfast and those items are pretty good. Not great but they do the trick for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, from the tea to the water lol .everything is great specials daily and the big mike breakfast you can't beat its a must try tell them I sent you they don't know me I'm only in every weekend"}
{"text":"Awesome, amazing, delicious I can go on and on. The food is great, friendly staff, and great prices. I love coming to this restaurant!! ( and I very picky )"}
{"text":"The breakfast was good - especially the sausage. I ordered coffee 11 minutes after I sat down.  I asked for Splenda because the table had only 1 packet. The waitress brought the coffee but no Splenda or napkin. I ordered  Big Mike breakfast and asked for Splenda again and napkins and utensils. After abut 10 more minutes, another waitress walked by and I asked her for Splenda and napkins. She returned shortly with them. My coffee was luke warm by then. My breakfast came out but no syrup for the pancakes. Oh yes, I still did not have utensils like a fork to eat with.
 By the time the utensils and syrup arrived, the food were cold. The breakfast comes with sausage but was forgotten on my plate so I had to ask for it. So both the waitress and he kitchen missed things.

The food was good, the restaurant clean, and the staff friendly so I will give them another try."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today for the first time and we won't go back.  The service is terrible.  It wasn't very busy when we arrived but it took 40 minutes to get food to the table!  Food was mediocre and that is generous. Our waitress never came back to check to see if we needed refills or to see if everything was ok."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!

The food was amazing and what we hoped fir with Southern comfort food. This is just what we needed while being in the South."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I was super excited about this place. My husband ordered the \"daily special\" that was on the chalk board. Chicken Fried Steak. I ordered Shrimp and Grits without looking at the menu:( We were told it would be 15 min. 10 minutes later the hostess told us they were out of the \"daily special\". It was 11:15 am. It took an additional 15min to finally get get our food. The grits are actually fried bread made with grits. Salty. The shrimp are the tiny frozen ones and the sausage had no flavor.. Like fried then soaked in water flavor. I couldn't even eat the Texas Toast. It was like the toast you would make at home out of desperation.. Toasted, buttered with way too much garlic salt.  My husband said his fried okra was ok. His Chicken Fried Chicken had a bland batter, the gravy just tasted like milk.. Not like a peppered gravy and it was on plain white rice. Boring. A star for the order being right and for the okra."}
{"text":"Good food,  excellent prices with kids eat free on Monday's.  Best deals in the land,  staff is extremely friendly,  and friends of mine have referred here,  said one of the best breakfast spots around."}
{"text":"Not fancy but fantastic. The turkey and dressing is worth the trip! Country style steak and fried squash also got excellent reviews from the table. I highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place.  Pancakes are to die for.  Very friendly staff. Comfortable booths.  Service was great and the food was amazing. Highly recommended to anyone who is a fan of breakfasts."}
{"text":"I was looking for s good southern breakfast!     This was it!   Great hot food. All the comfort food.  Friendly folks and southern charm.  They made me feel like a regular.  I will be back.   No time to even snap a photo!"}
{"text":"This is good, honest and simple southern fare, as it should be.  The staff is pleasant and very accommodating, and this is definitely a place where I can take out of town guests for a low key meal.

I have yet to have anything here that is not satisfying.  The décor is a little sparse, but hey, if you're going for the décor, there's another place in the next town over that is beautiful, but you'll be disappointed in their \"southern kitchen\" and it's creations."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Gastonia to eat! First of all, when you walk in the lovely hostess with the awesome pink hair makes you feel like you walked right back into your home. The food is incredibly cooked and it is perfect. Would recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Never had such poor service in my life. Waiter looked disinterested. Kitchen couldn't have been slower. It took over an hour for basic breakfast foods. Best part of the experience was leaving."}
{"text":"Place is amazing!!! Great food and fast service! There breakfast is amazing as well. I have never had hash browns that I have not had to put ketchup on!! It's a must go for sure!"}
{"text":"I got the French toast and biscuits & gravy. Both terrible. 

French toast was soggy, under cooked. 

Biscuits weren't biscuits, they seemed to be slider buns. Gravy didn't have anything to it. No sausage chunks, no interesting spice. Side of sausage patty looked like a burger patty and was also bland. 

Incredibly underwhelmed, I've eaten at a ton of southern restaurants all over + non-southern restaurants that put these attempts to shame. The worst breakfast I've ever had at a restaurant. 

Also, put more chocolate in your chocolate milk."}
{"text":"We only waited a few minutes to be seated, despite them being rather busy. The service was a major bummer and the food was mediocre at best and we waited 30 minutes between order and food on the table. Our drinks were empty for at least 10 minutes. We waited another 10 minutes after we gave up on the food for her to bring our check back. There were four or five servers so I don't think she was just overwhelmingly busy. The kitchen seemed backed up and I could tell he looking around that everyone else was waiting a long time for food and becoming irritated too. These were the worst pancakes I've ever had. Ate two bites and it just wasn't worth the carbs. Home fries are just seasoned potato cubes. Asked for crispy bacon and it was limp. Just super disappointing since we desperately need good breakfast in this county!"}
{"text":"Family owned and unique. The owner recommended the \"soul rolls\" and I will say I've never had anything like that. This place is definitely soul food with a twist... not just basic cafeteria food. There is always a good crowd, a local favorite, although it's not on a main road.  Obviously locals love this place."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated. The whole staff was very nice. The appetizer we had was amazing and came out in a timely fashion. The food was good too. Definitely will stop by here whenever we're over there again."}
{"text":"I've been going there for a few months now.  Was A M A Z I N G when I first started going.  Now, the online ordering seems to be acting up. So I call to place my Togo order and it took the lady 4 mins for me to spend 6 bucks on one meal that I always get from there.  This place has the potential to be a 10 restaurant."}
{"text":"This little spot is a must \"eat at \" location. The people are friendly,  the food is great! Nice portions, and the environment is friendly. This is my second time here and will be back again."}
{"text":"Went for the first and last time... food was bland, cold and incorrectly cooked.. sides were cold, crab cakes were burnt on the outside and under cooked in the middle with hard pieces that I believe to be bone. When we walked in the smell of cooking grease was overwhelming and the longer we stayed there more nauseous I became. Had to change clothes and shower when I got home to get the smell of grease off me.  Waiter was nice."}
{"text":"I came here super excited, my barber eats the food We walk in, nice people every where, and everyone is all smiles. 

We get sat right away, it's not to busy either. 

Drinks are ordered, food is ordered at 11:04. 

Then we sit and wait. 

And wait 

At 11:29 our food comes out. 

We ordered one meal to split, the Mike specials 2 pancake, scrambled eggs, and livermush, and grits. 

Why this took so long, don't know.

The pancakes were dry as all hell. Bad batch I was told. 

The scrambled eggs had a slime coating and were undercooked. 

The livermush was alright, and little jello-ish on the inside.

The grits were really good though. Those earned one star. 

We were asked how everything was, after I told the waitress when she  sat our food down we were about to walk out. 

I told her the truth. 

She said I'll get that taken care of. 

The manager, I guess b/c she didn't introduce herself, came over, and asked what was wrong. I told her. We are still hungry it's now almost 11:40. She doesn't offer to make us more food, just said I'll take care of the bill, apologized, and walked off. I left two bucks on the table and walked out. 

Worst dining experience I've had in gaston county... I'll be shocked if this place last longer than a year or two more if that. 

We are now sitting at Tijuana Flats enjoying food and I started this review with two starts but after how I got such good service here I knocked it down to one. 

Way to treat your locals Grits and Green!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and the food is usually outstanding. The services also matches, however I have been there on two occasions where the food was served cold and service was horrible. If you can, avoid the server named Sharon, larger woman with blondish hair. Not sure what she does, but she does forget about your food and serves it cold and gets the order wrong EVERY time. 

Aside of my two poor occasions, the food is usually quick to be delivered, tastes outstanding, and always fresh. Their mac'n cheese is amazing, the white gravy (of which I have never been a fan until this place) is the best I've ever had, I've brought friends and family who also agree, BEST white gravy ever! Be sure to try their Texas Toast (even if not a fan), it's so flavorful and yummy, they have turned me into a southern foods lover. 

Wednesday's is a fried chicken specials night. My mom is the most picky fried chicken eater, and she gave their fried chicken 5 stars, hands down the best restaurant chicken she's ever had (from a professional chef and previous restaurateur,  that's an amazing compliment). 

It's safe to say we'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed a family dinner here.  We went for \"kids eat free\" Monday.  They had a good choice of quality kids meals included (real cheeseburger, home cooked chicken tenders, nice plate of spaghetti, homemade mac & cheese). For adults, I would recommend the philly cheese steak and the fried pickles.  Salads are fresh & have home-made ranch and blue cheese dressings.  The waitress was very kind and understanding of special needs children.  Food took a while to cook, but it was good when it came out.  My only suggestion would be to find a way to anchor the booths & tables so they don't slide around.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We ended up going 2 days in a row. Breakfast & lunch are both GREAT! You absolutely have to try the soul rolls! They have a great staff & Mario makes sure everything out of that kitchen is the best!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here. Good food, good service, good prices. Nothing extraordinary, just a great place that can be a reliable choice!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the county! Prices are reasonable. Most of the staff is very friendly, especially the owner. If you go on a weekend, make sure to choose Saturday because Sunday's cook is not as good. The grits are cooked to perfection and already flavored without the need for salt or butter. I love my eggs soft scrambled and this place knows how to prepare them perfectly! Be prepared for a wait, because this place is always packed! It is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Loved this little diner. Great breakfast and friendly service.  Open early as we had breakfast here after a red eye flight!"}
{"text":"Best shrimp and grits in the area, and I am a loyal Charleston, SC area shrimp and grits fan. The service is a little slow at times, but waiting a while is worth it. I would definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here. It took over an hour just to get our food which you could tell had been sitting under the lamp for some time. The waiters and waitresses were literally running around the dining area. No one knew what was going on. It was ridiculous."}
{"text":"My wife is a bigger breakfast fan than me, but the Philly cheesesteak omelet was a good, unique breakfast item. Plus they have liver mush here. Gotta have that to be a good breakfast place in Gaston."}
{"text":"Sunday morning at 9:30 in the place was filled. As I'm looking out to the front of the restaurant right now there about 20 people waiting to sit so I'll make this quick. I ordered Mike's big breakfast and I promise you it was big.

The food was plentiful and it was good. I would probably eat here again. My friend ate everything go bite of her food and she got a lot. You know who you are"}
{"text":"If you are looking for fast food this is not the place for you but if you are looking for quality, good food then head on over to Grits n Greens. Staff were very friendly, the presentation of the food was good, and what I've tasted thus far was delish. Will be going again."}
{"text":"First time visit.  Front dining room is cute and busy, was seated in the back dining room and it feels ... big, it is like a church hall.  The hostess was nice, the server was not friendly, but not rude and, not good.  It took a while to get our food.  The guy behind me heard me ask for cream several times until he finally gave us his basket.  The eggs, sausage patty, and gravy were all good, real good.   The biscuit was so dry it was inedible.  My friend is new to the area and we were disappointed, especially since not much is open on Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Since I've been in the Gastonia area, has been a great local spot for breakfast and lunch. Have been coming quite often to enjoy the local dining experience."}
{"text":"Always a nice family type restaurant to visit. The staff is very friendly too. If you have tired the soul rolls you are definitely missing a treat! Love this place! Oh, they cater too!!!"}
{"text":"We had the privilege of stopping in last week for a lunch. It has been several months since we have been able to stop in at the local restaurant.

However our experience was very similar to the earlier experience. If we are on a tight schedule such as a set lunch time, This location may not be the best choice.

It takes longer than it should to place an order and a lot longer than expected to receive the order. By the time that our order was at the table the food was warm and not hot. 

We should expect this from some orders but our order consisted of vegetable plates that should have already had the food completed and all it needed was to be placed on the plates. It took us 35 to 40 minutes to get the food leaving us only a short time to eat and return to work.

The food was OK but not as expected. Will need to consider or reconsider this location during a lunch."}
