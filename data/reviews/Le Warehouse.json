{"text":"Great location and prices!
As previously stated, everything on the menu is 5$ and the burger i ordered was surprisingly very flavourful. 
We went around 6 on a Friday evening and there was no line to get in with the service being quite quick, however I have heard from a few friends that it can get very busy. 
I would recommend this restaurant and will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"A must for anyone on a tight budget! The food is amazing for the price and the service is super friendly. Service may take more time at peak hours, but definitely worth the wait!

Also, a cool tip: you can mix different elements from the menu together. For example, I added the braised beef to the potato peels and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. All the good is $4.95 and it is actually descent and filling.   Drinks are normal price between $8-15$. They have locations in Ottawa and Toronto. We just went for lunch and the service was really good. In Ottawa the place becomes a high energy place at night so I imagine it must be similar here."}
{"text":"I understand tight budget but seriously the food was so bad I couldn't put it in my mouth.  I felt like I was eating cat food. I actually find it shocking they people would give this place anything other than a poor review.  Service = zero, food = zero, ambiance = zero unless your into under aged teenagers drinking their first time and phony hipsters Waring funny hats. I get the whole \"On a budget thing\" but Montreal is a city where we take pride in our food and restaurants. Its what we do, who we are! I felt like I was in Ontario Jack Astors....;-("}
{"text":"The good: The staff is very friendly. They all seem to have their own sense of style, which is cool. 

My overall impression of the warehouse is very good! The food was only $5 per order! Which can't be beat! Personally I ordered wings, the \"smokey burger,\" and the BBQ chicken burger. All of the items were good. Included wi h the burgers were your choice of fries or a salad. The overall vibe and environment is amazing. The music is 9/10 for me! 

The bad: While my overall impression is good the lines to get in can be quite long. Plan in advance. 

The ugly: While the music is awesome, it can become a little too noisy at times. Also no debit is accepted method of payment is either cash or credit. There is an ATM but the fees are $3.00

\"Should I go here?\"

If you are broke, hungry or bored this is a really awesome place to eat!"}
{"text":"i love this place ! can't beat the price, great atmosphere, great music, food is good considering it's only 4.99$ the waiting line gets pretty long so you might stand outside for a good 15-20mins. that's how good this place is :)"}
{"text":"Went there 2time the food is basic but well presented and good value for the price 3.5 star
The service could be a lot better if waitresses had less stress because of the popularity 2stars
Sat inside much too noisy and not crazy about high tables moved back to terrace and waited an extra 15 mn for a table
Ordered a Stella on tap it was flat not cold enough end up drinking only third u better with a cold bottle 
U guy should ask the client to bring our own fork and knife was lucky to get a knife it came with the burger , a plastic fork is better than the one u supply 
Back to my burger ,need a little mustard or some kind of sauce to make it tastier 
The salad where good and well presented 
Worst mojito ever u better improve the bar to sell more alcohol this is the concept I guess....."}
{"text":"Huge portions for next to nothing. It's located on the lovely crescent street and sitting on the patio just makes for the perfect Montreal evening."}
{"text":"Service was terrible on a Tuesday night, food is o.k. was there an hour and a half not worth it at all."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice. We sat outside on the upstairs patio and the music was bumping, but the drinks were not so great. Standard stuff."}
{"text":"Le Warehouse has great food and all items on the menu are $4.95. Portions are excellent. I figure they make money more on the drinks. I was surprised at how quickly our large group was seated and served given how busy the place was. Great service, great food, awesome Raspberry Mojito!  
They are also open until 3am which is perfect!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday. Arrived a bit after 11:30 and there were only a few tables but it got packed really quick once 12 came around. Everything is $6. I ordered the Mac and cheese with braised beef (additional $2.25) as recommended by another review but I found both the Mac and cheese and beef pretty salty. My friend ordered the spaghetti with braised beef and fish tacos. Food doesn't taste that great but the restaurant was cozy when we went so not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Food was good and cheap. Service and atmosphere was great! They had a DJ playing excellent mixed all night long and the staff was just fun! We came here every night during our three day stay. Definitely recommend this place for some tasty eats. I recommend the Mac and cheese (with goat cheese) and the killer kool-aid!"}
{"text":"During my short stay in Montreal, I came to Le Warehouse twice for lunch, so that's saying something. Both times were right before the rush, so we were seated immediately but waited ages for our food since it got busy within minutes. The food menu is $4.95 which is a total steal for decent portions and a plethora of options. But that $4.95 quickly adds up with drinks, appetizers, dessert, and add ons. 

Let's talk food! The mac & cheese is maybe the best thing on the menu. It's cheesy with a kick and a crunch for good measure. They recommend adding meat, but I added garlic bread instead. I come from the land of \"Texas toast\" and I can say that this chunk of garlic bread was too legit. The tacos, burger, and grilled cheese were pretty good as well. The chicken strips + fries were the worst I've had, hence the 4 star rating. The onion rings and perogies are phenom, while the queso and potato skins are decent. Donuts for dessert are a must.

Our waitress was the best part about this place and the reason why we came back a second time. And though she wasn't serving us the second time, she had complimentary donuts sent our way- so sweet! I could go on for ages, so just check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"I can't remember what was on the menu but, I do remember ordering a kale Caesar salad and chicken fingers (probably the best I've ever had, seriously!). Music was awesome, there were many throwbacks and people were singing along too! The place was busy and loud. Our waitress was kind and attentive. Everything on the menu for under $5 is awesome! I was glad we stopped here on our trek down Rue Crescent."}
{"text":"I have been to Le Warehouse on three occasions and enjoyed my experience there each time. Because of their \"$4,95 per items\" concept,  I have to admit that I was a bit sceptical and had decided to try it on different occasions before writing a review...I have tried their evening service (at the bar) and with my coworkers during lunchtime (we were seated at the terrace). The atmosphere was great, during the evening it is more of a bar with a bit of loud music and during the afternoon it was way more relaxed. Regarding the food, I tried their wings, doughnuts, apple pie, sweet potatoes fries and one of their hamburgers... I've also tried their drink of the month.... The food is not extravagant but the portions are good for the amount you pay. Le Warehouse is more of a place to \"chill\" with friends in the heart of downtown rather than a five-star restaurant, however, surprisingly I really like it there and will be going back in the near future."}
{"text":"This is our daily dinner stop. The food is cheap and still delicious. The servers are very helpful. The burgers are amazing. Drinks are also good and you'll have a lot of options. Also, the ambience is great. Carry an ID though."}
{"text":"Ordered Union street noodle salad, and works burger. Portions are great for one person though shared meal. Flavor is lacking ..... Good for midnight after party snack. Servers were great."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday evening, and we had to wait about fifteen minutes, which isn't that bad. The service was great, the waitress was smiley and very patient with us. This isn't a fancy place so you can't expect the best quality, but I must say I was pretty impressed by the good taste of my chicken wrap. I loved the vibe, the loud music and the young environment. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The location is perfect for students on a tight budget. If you're reaching the end of your paycheck and still can't do photosynthesis to feed yourself, well this is the place for you. 

For 4.95$, you can get a variety of different items from salads to burgers. The food is nothing spectacular, but is very decent considering the price. The burger comes with a side (soup, salad or fries) which makes it even better. 

The service was ok. The food came pretty quickly. Would be better if they warned us that the mayo was an extra 1$ before being surprised by the bill."}
{"text":"Decent place for cheap food, but the wait is always very long. I had the mac and cheese + pierogies. Both of them were spicy, but more in the bad Mexican spicy kind of way. It was very odd."}
{"text":"$5 food sounds great. I enjoyed the food and I really liked their malibu drink. It was sweet and refreshing and reasonably priced around $6-7. They play really loud music so if you hate talking to people, you can come here and chill and avoid talking to them"}
{"text":"The price is good 4.95 for all meals, but the service is slow as a turtle!! They took forever for the food and the bill. The food isn't as good either. You defiantly get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Happened to just walk by, wanted to get a drink, and got seated right away.

The best part about this place is that all food items are $4.95 and the portions are significant. The menu is vast, including starters, salads, tacos, burgers, noodles and dessert.

I wasn't super hungry but I felt compelled to try something since the price point was so low.

The Union Street Noodle Salad came with chicken, spinach, avocado in a soy ginger dressing. Hot sauce (Frank's red hot) was a $1 extra. Interesting hot sauce choice for an Asian noodle salad but it still worked.

The best choice though was ordering the Mini Donuts. It basically tasted like amazing churros with dulce de leche dipping sauce. Incredibly worth it and a great option to come to for booze and bites."}
{"text":"Everything (food wise) is $4.95 , add ons extra.

Not a bad burger, filling, but service is quite slow, even though it was not busy. 

Tip: accept cash and credit but no debit cards"}
{"text":"Tried out the Warehouse while meandering Crescent during the Grand Prix- Great food, great service, great prices.  My boyfriend and I shared the perogies to start, they were delicious!  He had soft tacos with beef and said they were wonderful but a bit spicy, while I had the Baja fish tacos and loved every bite!  Food was fresh-tasting and unpretentious but stylish enough you marvelled that it was only five dollars a plate!  Our server was attentive and helpful, and easy to find despite it being busy.The music in this place is very loud though so don't expect to come here for an intimate conversation.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Beware the line up and wait but if you're looking for a nicely priced meal, Le Warehouse might be your spot. $4.95 for almost every food item on the menu allows you to mix and match 2 if you're hungry or have a meal for about $5. 

I had a burger and some potato skins. The food was good and portion size were great considering the price. Would definitely come back but with the popularity of that $5 menu, I find a line up most times I pass by."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place, and my feelings are similar to others': good value for the price, but food was not spectacular and the wait for the food was very long. I was there on a Friday night, so that might also explain it a bit, but we waited for more than 30 min. 

I got the Smokey BBQ burger which was supposed to be spicy, but I didn't taste anything spicy at all. It was still an enjoyable burger though, slightly better than one you would get on a rooftop BBQ, with a more crispy bun, slightly more tender beef and a lot of BBQ sauce. The fries that came with it were surprisingly good. Very crispy and consistent. I also had a margarita, which was ordinary, but they also have these special cocktails with a bottle of Corona reversed into it, which was neat. The flavour of the strong liquor was kind of faded by the Corona which I like. The price for the alcohol was cheap too, ranging from 5.5-12$. 

The inside was very packed and loud. We sat outside, which was enjoyable, but there were many people smoking in the vicinity, which really annoyed me. 

Overall, it was a good meal and it was amazing that 5$ could fill me up when I was dying of hunger. But personally, I would rather spend 10$ to get something tastier when I eat out."}
{"text":"Best burger of my life. All other burgers will be measured by this burger. I got The Works burger. Perfectly cooked, a substantial bun without being overwhelming. I got it with greens, which was a delicious salad. We had eaten at their sister location the night before and the mixed drinks were basically expensive fruit drinks, so I opted for the Dublin cider. Awesome, and right now they're doing a promotion on their coasters where to can win a pint glass. I got two coasters and won a glass off one. My friend got the Mac and cheese, which was absolutely delicious. She was disappointed they had run out of boxes, because she couldn't take her left overs home. I'm blown away that all the dishes are $5...I expected at that price to need to order multiple entrees, but the serving sizes are great. Not too big, not too small, just right. Definitely coming back here the next time I'm in Montreal"}
{"text":"This just happen to be our last stop for food before we were gone from Montreal, it was save to say it was a fun trip and one last meal to go was  a good idea.

The initial reception was telling,  it did take a bit of time just to get served, it was a bit busy when we came in but filter out half way through the meal. The place is popular spot for college students and especially people on a budget as everything on menu was under 5 buck, there were extra charges for other things but unneeded. 

I went with Burger with pirogee as an app. Burger was tasty, juicy patty and sauce add to favour. 

As I said service was a little slow but all and all a good meal"}
{"text":"Well, first of all, don't forget your ID, because it's technically a bar and they will card you if you look young.
The menu is a dream for any student on a tight budget (yep, everything is 4.95$) but beware, ANYTHING else is extra. I got asked if I wanted pickles in my burger. Surprise, it's 0.50$ for one flimsy slice of a pickle. Also I couldn't get the dressing on the side for my salad. (... but why?)

Service was very slow (good thing we had stuff to talk about), and on a Tuesday night too. They made a mistake with my order, then corrected it and brought it back, but it was still wrong. At this point, I was so hungry that I didn't bother telling them again.
Waitress was friendly but pretty pushy. Waiter tried to take away a plate that clearly wasn't done. Twice. 

Overall, I guess it's still a good value for your food, if you're ok with waiting and subpar service."}
{"text":"Their menu is great - wide variety of great food at $5 each. Had a BBQ burger with a side of fries and fish tacos. Tasted great, and portions were pretty large for the price. Service was pretty good, too, but our orders sometimes took a while to get to our table. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Lots of good music and fun music videos on the screens. For 4.95$ each plate, I was very satisfied. 

I ordered the bacon potato skins and the mac and cheese.
The potato skins were a really nice change from ordinary fries.
However, I am very particular about mac and cheese. I have high standards. Sadly, this one did not meet them. The pasta wasn't the traditional mac and cheese pasta and the cheese had a sort of slightly spicy taste which ruined the actual cheese taste I wanted. It wasn't the worst I've had (See joe's panini mac and cheese) but it was disappointing. 

My boyfriend got the smoky burger and the beets and goat cheese salad. He really struck gold with the burger. It was so good!!! I'm going to have to go back just to order one for myself. I also really want to try the tacos. 

For now it's a four stars because of the mac and cheese. But it was really close to being a five. 


Visited on the 8th of December 2016"}
{"text":"I literally made a yelp account so I could review this 'restaurant' because of how awful it is. I wish I could give this restaurant less than one star it was so terribly. The meal started out rough by taking TWENTY minutes for our unobservant waitress to greet us. She also never actually greeted us, just asked if we were ready (which of course we were we've been sitting here with no drinks in the sun for twenty minutes pal). If you thought twenty minutes was long ooooo just wait. It took AN HOUR AND A HALF for our food to get to us. We have literally been sitting for two hours with absolutely no food. When the food did come, it looked appealing, but was cold and flavorless. And to top it all off, the order was wrong. I asked the waitress where our queso was (which was supposed to be a quick appetizer because we were hungry) and the waitress forgot to put it in. So she told us she would get it out as quick as possible. 

So after we sit with our food finished I asked her how long it would be and she replied that she did not know.. it could be 5 minutes or 20. So I told her to bring the check and not worry about it. I wasn't waiting another hour.

THEN after waiting even longer for our checks to be collected, our queso walks out  the waitress came over to take the bills and I asked her if we could just get a box for the queso. She said yes, but she would need to take the checks back so she can charge me.

I kept my cool but I was raging on the inside. No way am I going to pay for a queso that YOU forgot to ring in and that I waited a little over TWO HOURS for. 

This was the absolute worst dining experience I've ever had and I would discourage anyone from going here. You would be better off not eating or going to McDonald's. I went in having a great day and left seething in anger"}
{"text":"5$ plates are great, however service was so extremely slow...:'( I am not a difficult customer ever but it took so ridiculously long to get our food/drinks. To end on a positive note the nachos were yummy:))"}
{"text":"As the story goes one of the original Warehouse restaurants was called El Furniture Warehouse in Whistler B.C. A group of snowboarders wanted to make a place that has good food for the staff who worked on the mountain and keep it at reasonable prices. Years later the concept stuck and now they are in Montreal and it rules!! Since everything on the menu is $4.95 it allows you to think with your stomach instead of your wallet, I always go for the French Dip because the Au Jus is so good. Here's a tip, get it with the onion rings because they finish it with a honey drizzle..fer shizzle! Also get a side of fish tacos they won't disappoint \m/"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great things about this resto where the food is $5 so decided to give it a try. Service was very slow as it took almost 30 minutes to get our appetizers. But to be fair the waitress was very kind and helpful when explaining the menu. I had the fish tacos and I was disappointed in the tiny piece of fish that was in my taco. There was not much of a taste and I was only given three small tacos. But again to be fair, it is only $5 so I wasn't expecting a huge fish but I expected more than a bite size piece. I also had perogies and they were alright. My friend had a burger which she enjoyed. The peppered fries were amazing. The music was very very loud and we were shouting over each other. In a nutshell, I would skip the fish tacos and go for the burger and fries. Its a good spot for a quick bite with friends and it is very affordable."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this pub. Went there during Lunch hour and were seated immediately. The vibe was relaxed and the music was grooving. Food, a menu for  $4.99!They are some add on prices to certain dishes but I still found it pretty cheap. I ordered the works Burger which came with fries. I have no complaints about this place. Ordering a non alcoholic drink can pricey but it's all good. Great for students on a budget... a thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Tried to make this the first stop out last night and stood outside for 45 mins waiting for a table. As a line began to form behind our group the hostess would come out a grab groups the same number as mine and seat them before us. If you're American or don't speak French Canadian I'd skip this place."}
{"text":"great place, ambiance and amazing service! the wait to get inside and the wait to get our food was kinda long but it's so busy and it's more of a place to have drinks, catch up with friends and hang out rather than get in and out quickly so with the cool music, great decor and friendly staff-not to mention good food and drinks for a cheap price- the wait isn't really an issue in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you're looking for comfort food for $5, the food is awesome tho my burger was a bit dry but that's cool. The mac&cheese was really good that was also $5. It does tend to get a bit busy and depending on where you're seated the service might not be the best. This place is not the place I'd recommend for the service it is the place I'd recommend for inexpensive good comfort food. The service is the only reason this place didn't get 5stars"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch today. When I arrived, you have to wait to be seated. It took them couple of minutes to direct me to the table. The menu has tons of variety which is great. I ordered the chicken burger with fries. The portions are moderate for the price but the fries were definitely not good as while eating, you can say that they weren't fresh. They were cold. Probably left overs from yesterday's batch. I was quite disappointed by my meal."}
{"text":"Great drinks! Great atmosphere! Service was slighting slow but I was there during there one year anniversary party so the place was packed. Food was also great!"}
{"text":"Honestly? Pleasantly surprised. Dropped by here randomly on a Monday night after another event nearby with some friends. We quickly got a table and proceeded to order $5 everything. I got the mac n cheese, and tried other people's food too, including the poutine and the roast beef.

The mac and cheese, and the poutine were both decent and filling for the price. It's a young vibe with cool waiters and fun music and ambiance. I would definitely return here for some fun vibes and cheap eats if I was watching my wallet!"}
{"text":"Basic, affordable, trendy, and perfect for students.
If you're hungry and want to grab a cheap eat with friends, this is the place for you.
Went for a weekday lunch, no lineup, service was reasonable.
Music a bit too loud and oddly varied...(it was arctic monkeys and all of a sudden country comes on??!!)
Food was honestly a good deal for $5. If you don't get drinks or add ons, that is. Drinks are much pricier.
Got the mushroom burger and it was on point. Patty was substantial, not overworked and juicy. Even comes with your choice of soup, fries, or salad, what a steal! 
Would probably come again!"}
{"text":"Pros: Food is awesome.. 5$ for any plate.. drinks are creative but a little overpriced.. good music..
Cons: music is too loud (hard to have a conversation).. no happy hour.. and be ready to wait in a line up.."}
{"text":"Good and friendly service. Maybe not the cleanest place, but would definitely go back for the cheap meals."}
{"text":"Service trop long...1 heure avant de recevoir notre commande. Et on s'entend... Hamburger, salade et nachos. On peut pas dire que ce sont des mets aux niveaux d'exécution élevé!!!
Autre chose... Je comprends le concept qui veut attirer une clientèle jeune et dynamique qui aime boire et dépenser mais avec le nombre de décibels qu'il y a, y'a de quoi devenir sourd jeune si tu fréquentes sans modération. Côté bouffe... La mienne est vraiment meilleure .
Gros reflux gastrique et ça goûte... Les nachos et les hamburgers et ... ah oui.... les salades.
À 4,95$ le plat c'est presque du vol car ton drink ' obligatoire ' coûte le double!!
Je trouve ce concept déjà passé date!
À quand les plats à 2,95$
Je donne mon étoile pour la grosseur des plats. Avec deux j'étais rassasié."}
{"text":"$5 menu with drinks on the pricier end. Food portions were on the small end, but still okay for an average lunch. Service was great and staff were all very friendly and super attentive. There's an amazing patio and balcony seating, perfect for the summer weather."}
{"text":"I liked it, had the nachos and they were good. Wish there was a way to know it's cash only aside from the ATM machine. They should really think of getting their card machines to take debit. They would have more business."}
{"text":"After waiting outside to be seated, we ordered drinks which came in a reasonable amount of time. Half an hour after ordering our food we asked our waitress what's going on and she said that the kitchen was backed up because the restaurant was full. It was only about half full. 20 minutes later I told the waitress we're paying for our drinks and leaving. Oddly enough she had no issue with this (I guess this is a regular thing) and as I'm paying she said \"Well, there is a 30-45 min normal wait for food.\" During the whole time waiting she did not come to check on us, refill our drinks, or anything else. This is a restaurant to avoid if you want to eat food."}
{"text":"Service was garbage.
Our waitress neglected to bring us utensils for our meal. No water for the entire meal... She was completely inattentive. Amateur service. Salad was not fresh and I had to beg for someone to come and change it for me.
Overall, would not go back regardless of the cheap priced food.
If the service is not up to par, not worth the trip.
Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Sooo GOOD! For so little! I know there's usually a line so we came here at 6 and there was no wait at all. I had the turkey sandwich with fries which was only $5 and my friends and I split the nachos with dip as well. Lighting was very dim but it gave it a good, chill atmosphere. It was also quite loud so it was hard for us hear each other but it keep our moods bright! Service was good although the waitress was a little disappointed we didn't order drinks (understandably, that's probably how they can afford to sell food for $5). I will definitely return! So many menu items looked good!"}
{"text":"Food was what was expected for the price. It smelled very off once you walk in. I think better execution on the food and a cleaner atmosphere would make this place even more popular."}
{"text":"Warehouse is one place that never fails to disappoint. Astounded by the price, I went here multiple times and tried out different dishes to see which one is good and which one is bad. 
So far, I have only had the best fish tacos and other amazing dishes.
Don't be fooled by the price, yes you can get quality delicious food for just $5.
I like some of their cocktails as well, the bulldog and the pink lemonade is my favorite. Naturally their drinks are expensive as they have to make up somewhere for the profits. 
The burgers are good, quesadillas are a good appetizer (portions are small though), nothing beats their chicken fingers and beer.
I also enjoyed their sun dried pasta (you got to add extra bacon ofcourse) very much. This is one place I religiously go to irrespective of the line up - totally worth it. The staff are extremely friendly and i love how they have named their card machines after celebs.

Highly recommend this place. Starve yourself and go here cause you can never have enough $5 fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Don't even know where to start. Ok went here with bunch of co-workers for dinner and a drink on a Tuesday night. Was pleasantly surprised with the energy, the music and the crowd. 

Spot is always crowded. Young folks, hipsters and people who just wanna have a drink. 

Food is good. All items on menu are $5.95. We got the chicken tenders and fries, chicken quesadilla (delicious), fish tacos (yum), loaded nachos. 

Yes unhealthy bar food - but tasty and cheap. 

Drinks are good. Shots are $3.95 each with exotic names like Porn Star, Liquid Cocaine etc. 

They have 20 or more kinds of cocktails at $8-$10.

Been here more than 3 times in 2 weeks. It's become one of our regular haunts. 

Oh and it's open till 3am (I think every night)!"}
{"text":"Food is good but honestly horrible service. It is so incredibly slow, don't go if you are in a rush. It's a shame because they have a good menu and cool restaurant it's just the wait is unbearable."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is $4.95- but be careful, with several menu items, they suggest an up charge to make your meal an actual full meal. The food seemed to lack in flavor. Not sure if I would return, it is very busy and a long wait so be prepared. But definitely is the most reasonable place in the area. The patio seating was nice and you have a nice view."}
{"text":"I first discovered this chain of restaurants in Whistler, BC, I had such a blast there. The food was great and the ambiance was amazing, I then tried the one in Ottawa, in Toronto, and now finally this one. 
It's the same concept, the same awesome and delicious 4.95$ menu, the same after-ski ambiance, and the same amazing service. 

The food is always on point, the drinks are great and not watered down, the staff is energetic, and the ambiance is nice. 

Overall I recommend this place, now obviously it's not a place to invite someone on your first date, but it's a nice cheap place to hangout with friends."}
{"text":"I loveeeee this place so much! The food is so affordable it's perfect to split many appetizers and main courses with friends. The ambiance is cool and laid back. I'm not a fan of their drinks though so far (many more to try hehe). I live for their asian style salad, so delicious and light. Perfect to pig out on many other sides! As for the service it's 50/50. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's really blah. Strangely it's when i go on quiet days that i wait the longest and don't get good service?!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome, it was on crescent st, a strip of bars and lounges. We chose to sit outside and had a blast eating and having drinks while watching the crowds of partiers passing by. The food is super cheap and delicious. The drinks were also great I had margaritas on the rocks. The great thing about Canada is you get seperate bills most places which I loved!! Overall I'd recommend this place if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"I tried. Still a no. Walked in and was looking for staff, absolutely no one seemed engaged. All the staff are clearly very close, which makes for a good atmosphere and teamwork, however they often seem a little distracted from their paying customers. Sat ourselves at the bar, went and got our own menus, waited to be served. Asked how long it takes for most food orders at this hour since we knew we were in a relative rush (1 hour) and were told 15-20 minutes. Needless to say that wasn't the case. We were the 3rd and 4th people to be seated at the bar. The 5th person to sit was served before we were even asked what we wanted to drink. It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to get a drink in front of you when you sit at the bar. Something has to be up with their kegs because I had had a Shocktop earlier that day yet the one that was served to me tasted off, almost soapy, and with an unpleasant aftertaste. In the screens around the bar, sports replays? Silent music videos from the 90s? Nope. Just a pixelated version of their insignia. Is your beer empty? Even at the bar you still needed to flag someone down for a refill if you're lucky enough that they can be bothered, and this is with less than 10 people being served... 35 minuted of waiting, one empty beer glass waiting, one near full beer sitting gross and unwanted, and no food. Finally! Food! Wait... F***.

Fish tacos come missing the sauces and toppings, sent it back only for the same plate to be returned accompanied with the words \"they were out of _____\". Its 5pm on a Thursday and you guys don't have things from sauce to cilantro? Oh here's your burger *spills fries on the bar*. Guy beside us who ordered leaves after 30 minutes, having ordered a salad presuming the simplicity would mean he would actually get it in time to eat. He asks to cancel it as he's waited too long. The bartender not only couldn't give two f*** but also gave the guy attitude about it. Zero customer service or etiquette. Fish tacos: flavorless. Fries that don't even reach the level of being warm, watery mac n cheese. \"Premium Alberta beef\" that I'm near certain came as frozen patties. Again, flavorless burger. Split the patty open and it's 100% the grooves from when it was ground. This means they added absolutely nothing to meat since the slaughterhouse. The beer glass is still empty. Potato skins dry and overlooked. 

When asking for our bill we were given a half apology for the longer food wait, but I wouldn't count it as a real apology as the bartender completely ignored us when we said the food belonged in the trash. My companion made it very clear upon payment that this was a complete waste of time and money, so as last time we were offered shots. Seems to be about the only thing this place has to offer is shots because everything else I've tasted from cocktails to beers to food has been terrible. One bad experience can be overcome. A second terrible one with bad service means you won't see me here again. I've been to a number of these \"$5 meal\" concept restaurants but this one has been by far the worst."}
{"text":"Quite honestly the worst dinning experience I've ever had. Food was decent especially for the price but having to wait an hour for my drink and an hour and a half for my food with no return by our waitress and no acknowledgement of our empty glasses while we waited for our meals this place is not worth the cheap price."}
{"text":"This a very good option for affordable and tasty meals...
All the food items on the menu are $5. They are all individual size but hey, they are only $5!
Just be aware that whatever you want to add will be extra.. like mayo, bacon, or anything else... the server will be suggesting you to add more items to your burger but that's part of their job.
Beers have regular prices but you still get a great deal with the food.
I came back to this restaurant several times during my stay in Montreal... it is a pity you can't find it in the West side of Canada... hopefully they will come this way one day..."}
{"text":"Cute little place! If you want a quick and cheap bite on Crescent then this is the place. They have good portions, fun drinks, nice vibes. Don't go if you want some kind of culinary experience, its more of a chill type of place. Bring your friends, grab a few of their drinks, and hang!"}
{"text":"Tout à 5 bales!
Une adresse dont on ignorait tout, à présent une référence à Montréal! Y entrer c'est l'adopter :) surtout si vous aimez la glisse! Des écrans passent en boucle, et sans pub, des vidéos de surf, snowboard, BMX, glisse en tout genre et nous, on adore cette ambiance là! La déco glisse, elle aussi de façon originale, et la musique suit le courant sur une bonne vague! Côté carte, le choix est impressionnant pourtant le goût est là ce qui est tout aussi impressionnant! Le burger est bien cuit, la sauce est au poil. Pour 5$ la portion est plus qu'honnête. La Poutine est top, le chausson aux pommes avec glace vanille fut très apprécié, bref, de la qualité pour les petites bourses ça fait plaisir! Le choix de bières pression ne se limite pas aux classiques, au contraire l'établissement offre des saveurs de microbrasserie très sympa! En résumé je suis fan et j'y inviterai mes amis, c'est juste parfait! 
Par contre oubliez les vendredi et samedi soirs sauf si vous aimez les files d'attente..."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant in Montreal that I will definitely come again. The food is not only incredibly cheap, but also tasty. We ordered salad and poutine as starters and they were huge. The muchroom burger and fish taco were delicious. The service there is also awesome.

I decide to go for local western food instead of those korean or japanese restaurants in Montreal ever since, and I strongly recommend others who come from East Asia to do so."}
{"text":"My favourite late night snack restaurant and bar on Crescent Street. The atmosphere here is awesome with great tunes (hip hop and r&b) playing on their multiple TV screens. The bar is also decorated with Christmas lights! There's also attentive and social waiters/waitresses that work here. Great customer service overall.

I highly recommend their \"Warehouse Crispy Mac N' Cheese\" with Braised Beef ($1.99 extra) dish and \"Union Street Noodle Salad\". All their snack plates are $4.95 plus tax! What a steal for quality food. Their portions are good but if you are very hungry I recommend ordering two dishes."}
{"text":"Been here twice since it opened. Feelings are mixed:

Pros - extremely worth the money, as I'm sure many here have already said the platters are ONLY $5 and extremely filling. Their burgers are bomb so def give that a try

Cons - service is soooo slow. Waited for 10 mins just to get water and an hour before getting our food. Yes, it very busy and yes, there were a lot of servers. BUT it seemed that the kitchen was very understaffed and the amount of waiters wayyy overstaffed

TLDR; great place for you and your wallet...but try to go during lunch or anytime that avoids peak hours unless you're willing to wait a long time"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place!!
Very big, lots of seating. Indoors is quite noisy with the music unfortunately a bit too loud (in my opinion). Food was good, and cheap! 4.95 is a really great price and the food is fine.
Drinks are more expensive but as is expected.

I do not recommend the \"strong island ice tea\" as it was not particularly strong.
However, I strongly recommend the \"pink lemonade\" drink (I will attach a picture). Yummy & worth the money!!

Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Great spot, awesome location, mediocre food. The plus side there is a vast draft selection. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. Places were not bad at all the concept of everything being five dollars it was interesting but it definitely showed in the quality of their burgers. I'd recommend it but I would not recommend getting any hamburger."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night with two friends and left with a lot to be desired. The food was alright but the atmosphere was very unpleasant. The theme was obviously some quasi-American pub, British infusion but ultimately it didn't work, leaving me very overstimulated. The premise of the restaurant, which is that each food dish is $5 plus tax (so basically $6) intrigued me, but ultimately the price wasn't worth the wait and lackluster food. The servers seemed overwhelmed and the line outside in the cold didn't create a relaxing evening."}
{"text":"The service was amazing, employees incredibly polite, Food was amazing. There was a nice dark atmosphere with music playing. It was loud and you can barely hear anything but that was expected. Great place to kick back with some friends"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything on the menu is $5. Alcoholic drinks range from $6.50-$9. The food is decently portioned. They have appetizers, entrees, and desserts. You can even buy a beer for the chef! They close at 3am every night and have two levels, a bar on each floor. They have booth and tall table seating. The food is definitely delicious. They have vegetarian options too. I recommend the L' Mariachi drink, made with tequila and juices (coconut & pineapple). I love the chicken caesar wrap. Definitely try this place out for lunch or dinner or a snack."}
{"text":"Nous avons testé ce nouveau restaurant sur la rue crescent. Il s'agit du même propriétaire que l'entrepôt sur mont royal. Alors si vous connaissez le concept vous y retrouvez le même menu toujours à 5$. L'ambiance y est toute fois différente beaucoup plus animé, beaucoup de musique et de bruit. Nous étions sur la terrasse à l'abris du brouhaha, elle est petite mais permet de se mettre à l'écart. Nourriture égale à elle même peu dispendieuse mais savoureuse. Contente qu'ils aient ouvert une succursale dans le centre ville"}
{"text":"Honnêtement, je suis aller à ce restaurant de reculons, puisque j'avais reçu des mauvais commentaire, mais heureusement pour moi, j'ai vraiment apprécié mon expérience! Pour un 4,95$ on a des plats appétissant et de bonne portions! Personnellement, on a pris des plats à partager, mais un seul aurait été suffisant également! C'est sur que les verres sont un peu plus chère puisque les plats sont tellement abordable! Petit bémol, c'est très très tamisée, on a du sortir nos téléphones pour allumer le menus puisqu'on ne voyait rien!"}
{"text":"The 4.99$ food menu is amazing and so is the pink lemonade cocktail! The vibes at the outside sitting area are great and gives you the opportunity to enjoy the cool atmosphere of crescent street. Great place for late lunch and drinks."}
{"text":"Dope as fuck. Good vibes. Better music. 4.95 for any meal on the menu. I'm surprised you haven't heard of it / have to check the reviews, seeing as you should've been there yesterday."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because of the vibes. The atmosphere and the cute boys. Out of all the places I went in Montreal over the weekend this was the most FUN. It was because you had a bunch of college kids all over the place so it was truly LIT!  Please do come here if you want to experience great food, or customer service. The drinks had absolutely NO alcohol in them what so ever. Not a drop. 

Now Canadians believe in tipping at least 15% or more however I am from the tri-state area  and if you don't give great service or exceed my expectations its safe to assume that you will be given nada. The only reason why this waitress got a tip is because I was going back to the states the next day and the banks were closed to exchange my money back. I ordered the chicken fingers w/ fries and a raspberry mojito. So disappointing the food was cold after waiting 45 minutes. Not including the 45 minutes I waited outside to be seated, in the cold. 

 Now everything on the menu is $4.95 unless you want to add extras , those prices vary. The music was good it was nothing up to date. It was all old early 2000's music. Which I didn't mind a little throwback jam session. I was just disappointed because I wanted to hear some Canadian jams. 

All in all I am looking forward to coming back here. It was a great way to end my vacation.Just be warned , the food isn't great , you'll see grown ass men dry humping each other .. and you'll need 3 drinks minimum to get tispy."}
{"text":"Warehouse is a fun, lively and budget friendly spot in the heart of downtown for casual drinks/food at great prices ! I came here at happy hour on a Thursday night with a friend, we were lucky to arrive just before the rush to be able to be seated right away because before long both floors were full (in and outside) and there was a lineup of people waiting to get in ! The décor inside is very casual and cozy but clean and not dingy.  Service was great, our waitress was sooooo nice and made sure to keep checking on us to make sure we were not kept waiting and that we had everything we needed at all times, and never made us feel rushed to turn the table. For drinks we had the Palomas. They were strong but in the right way  , they tasted great and refreshing. Foodwise, they have a menu of 5.99 items to choose from which is a fun touch. The food is basically bar food and the quality and portion size is actually pretty decent and for 5.99$ its a great deal. (let's keep in mind, Its 5.99, don't expect gourmet magic but its tasty and will hit the spot to accompany your drinks!) I had the Mac and Cheese with added Braised Beef (it was tasty and the plate was enough to be filling ...and believe me I can eat!), my friend had the queso dip with chips and she really enjoyed it as well. I would definitely recommend this place for a fun casual happy hour and food/snacks that also wont break the bank."}
{"text":"One of the best bars/restaurants on crescent st. I went there a few times this summer and sat on the balcony upstairs which offers a fun view on one of the most active streets of Montreal. The food is great and for $5 it can't get any better than this.
Cocktails are ok, definitely recommend basic mixed drinks or beer instead. 
The only thing is that there's always a lineup and food will take a while to come out. As long as you're not in a rush, you'll love it !!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find! This place offers a great food for an incredible price. 5$ for everything really helps this broke students budget. I had a large variety of items because I was so excited to try everything! 

BBQ chicken burger - really good BBQ sauce but the buns to meat ratio was off but I'm not complaining for that price 
Chicken wings - wet standard and delicious 
Perogies - are a very filling appetizer, they are really good and a nice surprise they were lightly deep fried 
Nachos - such a large portion they are very generous on the toppings 
Burger - was good and basic 
Union noodle salad - it was very nicely seasoned and delicious as well 
Braised beef spaghetti - was good but I didn't get much beef on mine
Fingers and fries - the chicken fingers were really good but the honey mustard sauce was the best part! Similar to the Wendy's old sauce formula 

Overall this is an amazing place will definitely come back. You get way more for your money. So worth it!!"}
{"text":"awesome vibe and aesthetic, usually if there's a long line it's for eating outside, the inside is generally less crowded
the food is cheap and there are some real gems on the menu, some favorite being the onion rings, fish tacos (my friend's go-to), and the mac 'n cheese!
some items on the menu are definitely less tasty and not worth getting though, the chicken wings were very dry (\"crispy\") and bland, and the burger meat is bland and weirdly textured

the service (as others have mentioned) isn't very fast, but they're a busy restaurant so be expected to wait ~20 minutes for your food!

it's a great spot in a great location for a fun food date or chilling, and the atmosphere makes up for the service, not to mention the fantastic price! you can get a big entree and a meal for $14 total 

their drinks are also delicious, but obviously more pricey

atmosphere: 9
food: 7
price: 8
service: 7"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice in the past month and unfortunately don't think I'll be going back. First and foremost, the prices are excellent so no complaints about that. The only thing is that they charge extra for everything (which is semi understandable). I asked for hot sauce for a meal and was told that it was a dollar extra.
The menu is varied and hip but the food doesn't really measure up. The first time I was there, I had the Mac and cheese which tasted fake. I also had the fish tacos which were good but was a tiny portion.
The second time I was there, I had the grilled cheese which was undoubtedly the best thing I tried. My boyfriend had the chicken fingers and fries and found them to be very good. The only problem was that he asked for a bbq sauce instead of honey mustard and was then charged a dollar extra without being notified.
While the food was mediocre-good, the service was absolutely awful. The waitress was rude, inattentive and didn't check in on us after we got our meals. The food took over 45 minutes to get to us, which is pretty ridiculous considering it was not busy at all in there.
The last negative was the water. The cups smelled like toilet and there was a gross taste both times I went. 
4/5 for price
3/5 for food
0/5 for service"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is 5$. I had the asian noodle salad and my friend had the chicken wrap. The food is average, on the level you would expect from the price (except the donuts!) but it's a good alternative to fast food, much better than a McDonalds. We had an appointment at 7PM so we wanted something quick and easy to eat. We also had their ''beignets du facteur\" which are cinnamon sugar dusted mini donuts served with espresso toffee sauce. It was a good thing we only ordered one to share since they came with 9 of them! I didn't expect anything special about them but I was surprised at how good they were. Freshly made, they were hot and soft. We couldn't stop licking our fingers. :)

The music was way too loud though, it's hard to talk, also they don't accept debit cards so make sure you have a credit card or cash."}
{"text":"All food is $5!!! Yes, $5.00! Talk about an awesome deal. This place is perfect for students to come hang out or friends to go out and gossip and have a quick bite to eat. The atmosphere is very student oriented. The food is OK. But for 5 bucks, what more can you ask for? They have a great variety of drinks. The decor in the restaurant is nice and service is OK. Overall, I would come here again before a concert, or for a quick bite with friends on a weeknight."}
{"text":"The food used to be better, i was disapointed when i went yesterday.

Mac and cheese lacked of cheese, and the added spicyness is just some siracha sauce.

Fried calmaries was descent,but then again over spicy sauce siracha

Mushroom burger, bun was cold amd almost no mushroom, meat was strange as well.

Chicken finger and fries was descent.

THEY ask u if you want spicy mayo and if u say yes they'll add 1.00 for it without telling u.i hate restaurants that try to pull a fast one.( Same with allo mon coco with their cheese.)

I don't know if i would recommend this place,if you are on a budget,it's passable i guess"}
{"text":"As a student with a low budget this is probably one of my favorite place in Montreal. Its classy without being too expensive. I love taking my friends there because not only is the food and the drinks reallllyyyy good but the staff are friendly and funny. If you want a quick service then I dont recommend going a saturday night. The place is packed and you might have to wait outside a good 30 min.  But its so worth it !! I also recommend trying the Sour Key drink and the asian veggie sauté!"}
{"text":"Ok so the food is cheap 5$ a plate but for 5$ you get a 5$ sized portion. The food was very good but it is all apetizer sizes. But 10$ for 2 portions of great food is a good deal so why am I complaining???
They have anice selection of tap beer which is also reasonably priced. This is a low budget foid and drink place with a hip to hipster vibe. The only real downer is the fact there is a line to get in outside.
A little load but a cool olce to meet some friends before going to a real bar."}
{"text":"I can't believe the food is only $5 per order! The burgers were so tasty; warm crispy buns and just enough zing to them. If you like spicy flavours, the bbq burger is great. The mushroom burger was also flavorful but not as exciting (it reminded me a little bit of a Big Mac). The baja fish tacos were not so great, I wouldn't bother with them next time. I loved the fact that the burger came with a little salad. If you are on a budget, beware of the add-ons, cuz the waitresses just slip it in as a casual question and before you know it, you could end up with many more $1+ items than you wanted. 

The service is slow, but friendly. I liked that the big screen TVs all over the restaurant.  The seating is not ideal because you might be seated on a wooden block with  nowhere to hang your coat or your purse. Great place to hang out with friends, but it is pretty loud. 

Would I come back? For sure! Maybe not on a busy night when the line is long, but I would be happy to wait 10-15 minutes for a nice meal at a very decent price."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It has a nice pub ambiance to it. It's in the perfect location for students too especially those who don't have too much to spend.

FOOD: The food was good! Some burgers are better than others. I ordered the veggie burger once (which was not good) and a beef burger the next time (which was much better). The chicken wings were good but small and the calamari was ok. I would NOT recommend getting the chicken and fries appetizer because they are dry and lack flavor. Nor would I recommend the Asian salad (it tasted super bland). Overall, it was worth the price though.

PRICE: Everything is priced at 5$ (except for drinks), need I say more? It's a great price especially for the portion you'll be getting.

SERVICE: The servers are all quite friendly. Although getting the food took longer than usual, it wasn't too bad especially considering the amount of customers that they get and considering the fact that it is a two-story restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative -1 I would. The hostess is extremely rude and condescending. Others also commented on her rude demeanour. Her unprofessionalism drove us away. Meanwhile plenty tables were open and yet we could still not get a table. In Trumps words 'BAD!'"}
{"text":"Delicious, well-portioned food for a great price--only wish the wait for service wasn't so very long. I would definitely go back, despite the wait."}
{"text":"5$ plate, tasty and opens until 3am..I say hell yeahhh !

When it's late and the kiddos are asleep and we are exhausted and hungry we get some warehouse !

Our favs : chicken wings, fish tacos, perogies and the apple pie. 

I know some people complain about the noise and service but I never actually ate there. I always ordered to go and was always satisfied."}
{"text":"Cool place and atmosphere. Staff is nice, cheap drinks and food, with a really good menu of food and drinks. After we ordered our food we waited almost an hour for it. We had to keep asking if it was ready. When it finally came out it wasn't even hot. We didn't send it back because we were afraid to wait much longer and it had already taken so much of our night. So, we ate cold food. Still a trendy atmosphere and place to be."}
{"text":"Had the feel of a college dive bar. Nothing bad, nothing particularly good. Drinks are a little overpriced for what they are, though. It's probably better than most other similar places in the area."}
