{"text":"Anyone know why this place closed?  I dined there around once a month, and the owners/managers never hinted that they were closing.  Really loved this place. What a shame."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner last night and ate a bunch of sushi & sashimi.  I was surprised at how quickly our food came considering the previous reviews of slow service.  My husband and I shared the Tuna Tower, Kamikaze Roll, and Spider Roll.  The Tuna Tower was good, but a little awkward for sharing.  The other rolls were quite bland.  I'm not sure if I would go back (quite far for us) but I've yet to try their Korean dishes.  The restaurant looks like it used to be an Outback Steakhouse.  It's large enough to accommodate larger parties, unlike many Japanese & Korean restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and were quite satisfied with everything.  The prices are very reasonable ($10-15 for most special rolls, $15-25 for cooked dinner sets and sushi dinner sets; cheaper for lunch).  Service was attentive.  The complimentary Korean appetizers were pretty good and included a large portion of mackerel on the night we went.  The special sushi rolls and sushi dinners were decent, no surprises there.  The place is also very comfortable.  There's about a page of Korean dishes in the otherwise-Japanese menu.  Four stars for a pleasant dining experience but not quite a must-go place."}
{"text":"At Kaori, I had the Kaori Sushi Combo for $19.95 and was quite satisfied with the Mix of Sushi and Roll that both tasted fresh and was quite filling coming with it's own Sushi Boat, now only if they had a large Miso lake around it.  While I enjoyed the meal that came with Salad, Miso Soup and Green Tea Ice Cream, my friend WAITED until we finished to get his Chicken Katsu(13.95).  It was large portions but I'm sure they didn't have to HATCH their own Chickens to make that 2-slice cutlet meal.  Also the service ladies seems to have a lot on their minds as they walk right past me as I tried to \"Excuse me\" her over to get the E.T.A on my friend's dish.  Others got Suki Yaki($14.95) that look like a nice portion, Oyako Donburi($9.95) which I'm not sure what it is but a big GOOEY mess seemed alright.  Spicy Yaki Sakana-Salmon was basically a couple Salmon Fillets slathered with a SPICE concoction that I heard was not Spicy enough.  The place has some nice Japanese seating areas for that authentic experience while some paintings can peak your interest for discussion while CHOMPING on your free Korean apps."}
{"text":"My 5 star rating is based on not being able to find any faults with the place. The service was great, the food was good, everyone was friendly, and I really don't care if it's a Korean guy or a Japanese guy or a Ukrainian guy who makes my food. As long as it tastes good I'm happy. There's ample parking, the venue is super cute, and the food came out quickly, but not in a it's-been-sitting-around-waiting kinda way. Tasted really fresh. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch with my friend.  Replacing the Outback Steakhouse that use to be located there, Kaori is a newly opened Japanese restaurant.  I was greeted by friendly service, however they thought we were Korean and started to speak to us in Korean (heh).  We had three different waitresses come up to us.  My friend decided to order the yaki-don, and I had the Blue Ocean Roll.  The udon was a LARGE plate - but nothing really that special.  My roll was quite interesting - tuna, salmon, avocado, cucumber, and some seaweed!  Not only that, we had two salmon hand rolls on the house from the chef.  I was quite surprised for sushi in Richmond Hill.  Not sure if the service was just really good because it was lunch time, or because this restaurant just recently opened. May come back again!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Japanese food made by Korean. I would rather go to Tomo with better food and MUCH better customer service."}
{"text":"A coworker brought me to Kaori for dinner one night. We both ordered sashimi combos & I, for one, was mighty pleased. The portions were generous to say the least.  The appetizers were pretty good. Usual korean starters. The chef also prepared a little something special for us. They totally recognized my coworker as this is his go-to sushi place in Richmond Hill. I wouldn't say that this is mine though.  Service was alright. At the end of the meal we needed to wave down the waitress, but the beginning of the night was quite nice. Seated promptly, orders were taken and food was brought out in a timely manner.  I'm going to give Kaori 3.5 stars. The chef's special appetizer was a \"miss\" for me, but the sashimi... a \"hit\"!"}
{"text":"This place is ok for 'non-sushi' people. the cooked items are ok, but the sashimi was NOT fresh. I would only go there because it's walking distance from my boyfriend's (who doesn't eat raw fish). How super disappointed I was with 'freezer burnt' tasting sashimi. Cooked things are presented nicely and the 'chefs' on display make a good show, but I don't care about a show, I want quality food, especially when it comes to sashimi."}
{"text":"Kaori Japanese Restaurant is located across the street from Montana's Cookhouse and Kelsey's on Yonge, just north of hwy 7.   They serves mainly Japanese food, however since they are owned by Korean, the menus does have some Korean selections too.  They do have lunch specials which is a $2 or so cheaper than during dinner time. They are just hiddlen somewhere in the regular menu. :) Lunch set starts at $8.95.  Dropped by for an early lunch at 11:30 pm, yes I am the first to arrive.. 1 minute after the place is open for lunch.   I found the interior quite nicely decorated.. There are a lot of booth seatings that provide a lot of privacy and there are also some private room format seatings.  Decided on Sushi Lunch A($12.95) comes with miso soup, salad, Korean appetitizers and green tea ice cream. Everything so tasty and fresh. And love the green tea ice cream...   BTW, there are a lot of single females coming for lunch there! Including me 4 tables! At least I don't feel like I am the only lonely one...  Services are quick and friendly!  They accepts all credit cards."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to in GTA. I have been to a lot.   Service:  The waitresses are nice. The receptionist is nice. The waitresses walk really fast and serve you quickly. If you by chance get a new one, good luck with that!   Food:  Pretty good. The sushi rice is perfect. Its  held together just right. Not too hard or too soft. If it was too soft you would see it fall apart. This has happened to me before at other restaurants. I usually order the Black Dragon roll there. Yummy! For main, I eat Bulgogi which is stirred fry beef with onions and peppers. It comes with a miso soup and a bowl of rice.   Clean: The washroom doesn't actually smell bad. They used to give you lotion and mouth wash to use but I guess people took advantage of it. They clean up the tables pretty fast so you don't really have to wait..  Recommendation: BOOK A TABLE if you plan to go on weekends ESPECIALLY SATURDAY! It is like jam back on saturdays."}
