{"text":"Best chili ever! I use it to host large parties!  Everything I've served from there is a big hit!  Super great!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Just got done grilling brats we bought here. As always, their sausages are superb, either kielbasa, Slovenian smoked sausage or the brats. We have been buying meat there for years."}
{"text":"Nice staff, good meat, wide variety of interestingly named sandwiches, and although it doesn't have a parking lot you can usually find a spot right around the corner and get your sandwich to go in 15 minutes so you don't have to pay to park.  Cool old-timey art illustrations for each sandwich decorate the walls and front windows.  It's nice to have an old-fashioned butcher still in Lakewood for when you want some meat that tastes better and is prepared better than the supermarket.  
However, I have to say I'm not a fan of whatever contraption they use to heat the sandwiches.  It is some kind of a steamer and it makes the sandwich including the bread a bit mushier than I like it.  If you want some Italian sausage from here, buy it, take it home and grill it yourself with the appropriate peppers and onions - it just doesn't taste quite right out of the steamer. Would also be nice if they had a little more unusual variety in the soft drink selection."}
{"text":"The best deli around. It's our family go to place for sandwiches, chili and soup. Owners are local and knowledgeable. Each sandwich is carefully made-to-order, and never disappointing."}
{"text":"This is the west side standout satisfying Cleveland's questionably excessive infatuation with hot sandwiches packed with salty cured meats. Not sure how sacrilegious it is to admit, but I prefer my Reubens without all that Russian dressing, (what is it made of anyway?) and at TJ's everything comes out exactly the way you want it. 

I believe it was the great George Costanza who once said that pastrami is the most sensual of all the salty cured meats. That may be so, but the hot corned beef is the real ride or die ho. Get it with mustard and don't look back. 

You should probably get a pound of thick cut  bacon here while you're at it since, like Eastern European  comfort foods and shockingly bad football, we tend to take our relationships to the extreme here."}
{"text":"this place is the greatest . been going there since the 70,s best meats people are very helpful on getting orders  done to the finest . sandwiches are big and mitty . you get your money worth  with a smile. they have  the best sausage home made big variety  .the smell of the store  oooo it so good the soups, smoke sausage all combine  makes your mouth water .. to the crew and owner keep up the outstanding job yours truly the sausage  man.. thanks"}
{"text":"TJs is the only Butcher/Deli you will ever need in Lakewood.  Their Brats are by far the best I have ever had and I have tried a lot, plus they always come up with new brats all the time I recommend TJs specialty. Amazing assorted meats, fresh cuts upon request.  Best atmosphere around the type of place you can walk in and ask for your usual.  I frequent TJs and am always welcomed with a smile.  I love the place and will forever be a patron."}
{"text":"Best meat in town,  sandwiches are always fresh and lots of options. Nice people and even nicer tshirts"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment! The Lakewood Sub is my favorite! Highly recommend TJ Butcher block & Deli!"}
{"text":"excellent sandwiches plus fast, helpful and friendly service.
not to mention a superb selection of sausages and meats.
keep your $$$ flow local and do yourself a favor in the process and go here for all your deli needs."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get what you want from a butcher.  If you don't see what you want they will cut to order anything.
The house-made brats are worth going there alone.
The sandwiches are worth a try - each one is made to order on the spot.
Staff is extremely helpful.
No Sunday hours but being open 6 days a week is pretty good."}
{"text":"Loaded sandwiches with plenty of fresh beef, sausage, wine, and some great lakes beer all in stock. Small mom and pop type butcher shop that seems to do everything right. I will definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"TJ's is one of my favorite places!  The staff is helpful and friendly. The sandwiches are very good and I particularly enjoy the Hook and Ladder and Southwest Turkey.  They have a great selection of fresh cuts of beef, pork, and chicken.  They have a variety of bratwurst that is made in house.  This is my #1 location when getting ready for a cookout.  I love to smoke meats and have had great success with pork shoulder, beef brisket, and ribs that I have bought here.  Also, Kevin (the owner) has great input on preparation technique and cooking.  The burger blend is a must try!  The combination of meat ground together makes for the perfect grilled burger."}
{"text":"Kevin does a great job since acquiring this business. Great sandwiches that are enormous and fresh selections of steaks, chops and chicken."}
{"text":"Hi I just have to say that we have been coming to TJ's for as long as it's been in business.Everything in that store is wonderful especially their steaks which they will cut fresh if you don't see what you want in the case.I bought chicken there and made Chicken Paprikash with it.My Hungarian Aunt and Mom said it was the best they have every eaten.I didn't do anything different than usual,other than the chicken from TJ's Thanks TJ butcher block for helping out with that meal.Their sandwiches are just great too!"}
{"text":"Great prices on country style ribs! You won't find those prices at Giant Eagle! Great take-away deli sandwiches. Keep it local!"}
{"text":"Best place in town to pick up fresh meat.  Kevin and his team are friendly and experienced.  Never buy meat anywhere else now!"}
{"text":"Old School butcher who keeps everything local and wonderful customer service. 
What is better then a Delmonico.... two Delmonicos. This is now my favorite steak hands down!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and have picked up sandwiches from TJ's many times. I am happy with what I order every time. I recommend calling ahead with your order so you don't have to stand and wait as the place is pretty small and busy during lunch time."}
{"text":"Love it. Great basic deli sammys and great meat at great prices. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Give me the Italian or give me death.
These are the true sandwich artists.
I wish every Subway was buried underground and replaced with a TJ's, or at least a wormhole that would transport you to TJ's. 

Bonus points for being able to buy pierogies and meats (for the Cleveland DIY Sandwich Collective out there). Wish I could give it 6 stars."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in Lakewood. Tons of meatloaf of flavor. The Southwest Turkey is my go to lunch."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of TJ's! Not only is the food absolutely amazing but the staff is so friendly! My favorite thing about this \"whole-in-wall\" deli is that they cut the meat to order so it's always super fresh!"}
{"text":"Hello Chicago!!! Hot with a pickle."}
{"text":"Cool place, nice people. My boyfriend loves the food and I think it's okay but that's just because I'm a vegetarian so there's only one sandwich there I can eat, which is so-so. My opinion isn't the best for a place like this, though, so I'm letting the fact that he loves it bump it up to 4 stars. Big, big sandwiches that are worth the price, for sure!"}
{"text":"Was out and about with the boys and was actually really looking forward to a good deli sandwich, so my buddy recommended TJ'S. We look up the hours and luckily with time to spare we head up there, only to be turned away at 1:15, when the hours clearly stated 2:00!! I'm not sure what exactly the discrepancy is, but the issue needs to be addressed. Your hours are clearly not what they are stated to be, and quite honestly, I was shocked to be turned away in such a manner. I'm not sure how I'll ever know how good or bad these sandwiches are, because I'm not sure I'll ever return. One thing I do know for sure, is that their customer service was terrible in this instance."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and really affordable, the Italian sausage is one of the best I have had.  This is my new go to place for meats for summer grilling, simply the best."}
{"text":"As a Reuben lover, I would go here before Slyman's, Superior Deli, Joe's, Jack's Deli, and Corky & Lenny's, and The Place to Be.  (I reference those restaurants because they all offer a quality product as well)."}
{"text":"I really can't say anything more than anyone else but I love stopping in here for a fresh made delicious sandwich at a super fair price. Service is always quick, friendly, and makes you want to come back."}
{"text":"Homemade Garlic FRESH Kielbasa.... not smoked... SOO delicious! 

Great sandwiches and good local deli"}
{"text":"LOVE coming here to grab a sandwich for lunch. By far the best Italian sandwich I've ever had, but honestly, they're all great!"}
{"text":"Oh, baby! Does TJ's make amazing sandwiches. From a Jewish-inspired sandwich, to there fantastic Reuben - This is one place every Lakewoodite must try."}
{"text":"Mikey likes it.I've went past this gem probably 20 times and never noticed TJ's,which is due to me having the attention span of a gnat. Anyhow I've already digressed and it's my first yelp review...
I had the Pastrami and Corned Beef with Swiss on Rye. Flavor, texture, etc was very good. The amount of protein was perfect for me. After eating I didn't enter into a  state of gassy sloth for the rest of the afternoon like when I eat from some other delis but the tummy was full. The only drawback for me was that the bread quality did not match the other ingredients, however, for the price and the quick service I can't really complain. So many other options in this place that I look forward to coming back. Customer service was extraordinary."}
{"text":"Came here with few friends to try sandwiches. Apparently the sandwiches are very famous. Honestly i did not enjoy my meal at all. I felt it was too overpriced and the bread was dry.
I expected a moist juicy sandwich. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite sandwich spots. It's on Detroit, kind of easy to pass by if you're not paying full attention. The sign is hard to see, at least for me. 

You walk inside and it's a typical meat/sandwich shop, with the menu on the wall, the sandwiches named accordingly. 

There were two men and a lady working, the lady took my order and was actually really rude. It was my first time in there and I wasn't sure what I wanted but she kept rushing me to decide \"you ready yet\" \"you know what you want or not?\" Like relax honey. I got the big bird, with all the trimmings and some Santa Fe pasta salad. It was amazing. So delicious. The gentleman who rang me up was super nice in comparison to the evil witch behind the counter. My total came to $9 and it was totally worth it. The sandwich was good sized and loaded with turkey and cheese! It started getting busy when I was leaving and the place is very little so it can get crowded. All in all I'll definitely be back soon to try another delicious sandwich"}
{"text":"Oh my salami!  This place is GOOD.  I was starving.  I read the reviews.  I came.  I saw.  I conquered.  

An honest-to-goodness butcher shop.  They cut your meat to order and put it on the freshest slices of bread ever.  And they have to be some of the NICEST people in Lakewood.  Friendly service with a smile.  

I was a bit confused- I thought it was a sandwich shop (that's what I get for not thoroughly reading).  They *do* indeed make sandwiches, but it is not the sort of place that has tables and chairs.  My mouth was watering so much that I ran outside and I ate the entire thing sitting in my car, parked outside the shop.  

I actually had the shrimp and crab salad sandwich on rye.  I wish I were hungry for the pastrami or for the turkey or for the kielbasa or the Reuben, but I was feeling seafood today. And it was a success.

Next time I go back I'll order the corned beef on rye or the Italian or the Slovenian smoked sausage.....or just.....everything......"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, friendly staff and food was made in a timely manner. I like the turkey rueben here..."}
{"text":"I have ordered roast beef sandwiches a couple of times from them and was not impressed. One of the times the sandwich was full of gristle , and was terrible. The price for the sandwiches are pretty steep, I will not go back to them. Oh and by the way when you try to go on their website it says the site has been hacked."}
{"text":"I'm happy to say that TJ's has been a part of my life since there was a T and a J running the joint -- in excess of twenty years!

There are hundreds of reasons to shop at TJ's; the breakfast sausage is better than any pre-packaged sausage you'll get anywhere else, the bacon is unbelievable, the lunch meats are terrific, and the steaks and chops are top notch. But the deal-breaker here are the smokies. They're so delicious, I keep a pound on hand at all times, just so that when I do get a craving for them, I've got one or two or three to eat. Don't miss the eclectic seasonings, the pre-portioned and frozen burgers, and their collection of small producer's potato chips.

The sandwiches steal the show, too. With at least thirty to choose from, you could eat one a day for a month, and not repeat one. Well, unless it's July, September, April or December. Or October. But, whatever. That repeated sandwich will be worth it."}
{"text":"Where do you start with a butcher shop like TJ's?  Not only is TJ's  a wellspring of made to order sandwich selections, but I really enjoy knowing where my locally raised, grass fed beef is sourced.  The freshly made bratwurst varieties are all delicious. I recommend the smoked andouille for any meal.  It's mildly spiced for everyone's enjoyment.  The staff is very attentive will even laugh at your tired old butcher jokes if you are prone to cutting up in class.... In short if Clara Peller was still around, she would be at TJ's Butcher Block because there's the beef!!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, and the selection was very good.  The deli salads looked kind of meh,  so I didn't try one, but the sandwich I got was very good."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch recently, and my impression is that this is an awesome lunch spot. Wide selection of appealing sandwiches, and great prices. Had the king of the sea sandwich, which was essentially seafood salad on a croissant., and thought it was delicious. The crab was fake, but at these prices you should expect that. At a quick glance, the prices for the sliced meats and cheese here were comparable to the local grocery stores."}
{"text":"This place was unexpected and awesome. My friend brought be here and after looking at the reviews I was excited. It was lunch time and there was a line but they were staffed well and moved it along quickly! Friendly people behind the counter and at check out. (Although I wish they would have asked me if I wanted it hot-didn't know that was an option until later). It's a tiny place but surprisingly have a lot of items such as refrigerated drinks (including beer-yay!), nuts, chips, etc. 

Portions are VERY generous and prices are VERY reasonable. I got the ham and turkey (don't remember the name, guy something?) delicious. Can totally tell it's a butcher too cause the meat and cheese are just so straight off the block delicious and fresh. I loved my sandwich. Can't wait to go back and try the tuna next time, get my sandwich hot, and many other combinations!"}
{"text":"Nice little store. They have a wall full of pictures of sandwiches.   Everything is fresh nut it better be in deli!  I came here for the soup.   Names like stuffed pepper soup can stop me at almost any place.   But this time I landed in a place where my $3.49 but me a pint of soup.  The soup is loaded with rice, ground beef, pepper, tomato and onion (kind of the order of most to least).   Really good tomato base to broth.   And after thirty minutes in Styrofoam cup it could still melt plastic wrap."}
{"text":"Went here after asking if they had whole roasting chickens. They offered to set the 2 aside I needed which was awesome. Also while I was here I ordered a sandwich and it was HUGE. Price is fair, they answer questions. Place is always packed so that many people must know a thing or 2. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am old enough to remember the butcher shops of old. Don't let anyone tell you differently, none could hold a candle to TJ. The counter help is friendly, eager to serve and efficient. The selections are simply the best. The best sandwiches, the best meat, the best deli, the best condiments and the best prepared food. Tommy's is one of those places that West Siders smugly know surpasses anything on the other side of the river. For more than twenty years I have patronized TJ and always walk away pleased as hell. 

It is worth seeing a medium so I can contact my grandmother to let her know how much better TJ is than anyplace she ever knew."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb, they can seriously read my mind and know what I'll like, and that's what stocks their store. You can tell that every product in the store was curated by the people working there - I feel I could walk in their blindfolded, grab a few items, and they'd all be excellent. Their products aren't as cheap as a grocery store, but they're reasonable for the quality you get. They don't have a huge selection of products, but what they have are all A+.

I first got introduced to them at Taste of Lakewood from their Italian sausage. It was the best I've ever had, better than what I've gotten at the West Side Market from various vendors. Since then I've tried many of their products, their bacon is excellent as is any of the fresh meats they have.

They introduced me to my now favorite coffee in the world - Van Roy Dark 'n Stormy.
 I picked it up on a whim, my mind was seriously blown when I tried it at home.

They also have the excellent Uncle Mike's beef jerky, my favorite beef jerky and it's made right here in Ohio. Nathan's Horseradish Pickles are another excellent made in Ohio product they have.

I have yet to try their sandwiches, but I've heard great things and really need to get around to it sometime soon.

Definitely an asset to Lakewood and the west side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great fresh deli sandwiches for a great price. Every sandwich I've ever tried has exceeded my expectations. Only suggestion is to ask for your sandwich on the sub roll rather than the bun. Highly recommended when craving a good deli sandwich!"}
{"text":"Let's just keep this simple...

It was the best sandwich I've had since Katzinger's Deli in Columbus.  The hot pastrami and corned beef on rye was just amazing.

There were several other options and lots of great meat for purchase outside of the sandwich varieties.

You can choose your cheese, they offer horseradish and or mustard and it was just everything I wanted and more.  

I must have waked by this tiny hole in the wall a thousand times while living and working in Lakewood and now that I've been gone for 2 years, I finally figure find this gem! 

They also have a nice selection of beers for take out and they sell lottery tickets in case you were wondering.  I'll let you know if I hit the Mega Millions or Powerball tonight"}
{"text":"Fresh meats, good sandwiches, reasonable prices... And beer! You have found your deli."}
{"text":"Guy at the deli: \"What are you doing tonight?\"
Me: \"Netflix and chill.\"
Guy at the deli: \"By yourself?\"
Me: \"Yeah, the only meat I want is this turkey reuben.\"

The meat is that good people. Try the Philadelphian and a side of Bacon Ranch Potato Salad! The gentlemen behind the counter are friendly and helpful when you're trying to decide what to order (but they didn't know that Thirsty Dog is a local brewery in Akron even though they sell it, I forgive them)."}
{"text":"Love this little place! Stopped in last night and got some garlic brats to grill. Delicious and juicy! Will be going back."}
{"text":"The staff at TJ's is incredibly friendly, I feel like they recognize me each time I come in. The sandwiches are excellent and big enough to feed even the hungriest person in your group. I can't speak enough on how nice it is to be greeted with a smile each time I stop in. Support local business and stop into TJ's!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Lakewood and checked out TJ's after reading the Yelp reviews.  Love, love this place for their sandwiches and customer service.  They cook their roast beef, corned beef and pastrami in house.  OMG, what a difference!  They have so many sandwiches to choose from.  The only sandwich I would not recommend is their seafood salad.    However, they let you sample things before you buy, which is nice so you don't end up spending $$ on something you don't care for.  They have many other products I'd like to try, such as homemade sausage and kielbasa, stuffed chicken.  This place beats the many other well known chain restaurants nearby.  Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This is a small place that usually has a line outside the door. We stopped in for a couple sandwiches and salad for a impromptu picnic at the park. Wow!!! The Dagwood was awesome. The bread was fresh, piled with several cuts of high quality freshly cut deli meat. Did I mention it was huge? The average person would have no problem splitting it with a little salad added but of course the glutton in me ate it all. Macaroni Salad was pretty good (probably a solid B). There were chips, sodas and what not. I Glanced across the butcher area; all the meats appeared good quality at fair prices."}
{"text":"Great deli!  I go here as part of my regular lunch rotation.  I don't have a favorite sandwich because all are great.  I've bought meat here for cookouts as well as custom gift boxes (kind of like Omaha Steaks style), but waaaay better prices and much fresher!"}
{"text":"These guys were very nice, place was clean, great big selection and, oh yeah, THE SANDWICH!!! they are big and juicy. Had the Dagwood...best I ever had! Cole slaw melts over the mound of meat and makes so moist. Will stop here for lunch whenever I'm Lakewood for an affordable Sammy!"}
{"text":"A golden gem in Lakewood. I'm hooked on the \"Lakewood\", \"Chicago\" and \"Triple decker\" sandwiches. It a true mom and pop style butcher shop that only cares about giving you the best service possible. The only regret I've ever had with TJ's is that I didn't discover it sooner."}
{"text":"Fabulous sandwiches and great service.  Our group of 8 found TJs on yelp and came down to get sandwiches to go for a day long bike trip.   Corned beef -toasted - was amazing.   Chicken salad was definitely a male version-tons of meat but no foo foo grapes, nuts, or fruit.   Service with a smile too!"}
{"text":"I love this classic walk up deli where the meat and cheese is fresh sliced and the service is friendly. My hubby and I ordered 2 sandwiches, 2 chips, 2 drinks and a giant cookie all for about $22! Such a deal! 

I had the hot corned beef with swiss on toasted white and hubby had the hot pastrami with provolone on toasted kaiser roll. You definitely can't go wrong with either but both of us agreed the corned beef was a notch above. 

I would definitely come back here on my next visit to the area."}
{"text":"This place sells sausage with the sauerkraut already packed inside. END OF FUCKING STORY. Seriously, this is the kind of deli your grandma frequented, except they have Vitamin Water and shit like that."}
{"text":"If you live w/in 45 minutes of Lakewood you owe it to yourself to check T.J.'s out for BBQ & anything else to complete a summer meal. Tops!"}
{"text":"\"My homeboys tried to warn me, but that pastrami you got make me-me-me-so hawney\"
Great sandwiches and beer selection.  The GLBC neon in the window gives my wood.  I asked them to make a useable belt buckle out of brisket and they didn't even seem mad.  Ill keep working on em ;)"}
{"text":"Corned beef and pastrami are some of the worst I've had in Cleveland. Every gas station in the city uses better corned beef."}
{"text":"The Chili is the bomb and the sandwiches are all good too! Great customer service too. Go here to get your meat not that crumby giant eagle across the street"}
{"text":"Been meaning to review this place for a while. They have the best takeout sandwiches in town. The menu is big and animated with really descriptive pictures. They have a sub for anybody. The price is great, the staff is friendly, and the food is perfection."}
{"text":"Mmmmm....pastrami, cole slaw and deli mustard. In the right hands, combining these ingredients makes magic happen. In Lakewood, the right hands for the task belong to the good folks at TJ. When we lived in Cleveland Heights, we frequented the sandwich counter at Mister Brisket on Taylor Rd and it's one of the (few) things we knew we'd miss when we moved to the west side. 

We found a more than adequate substitute in TJ on Detroit Rd. Sandwiches are reasonably priced (many under 6 bucks) and they have a good selection of chips and drinks as any good grab and go deli should. The sandwiches are so tender and delicious. They use some sort of machine called the 'Fresh-O-Matic' to somehow make the sandwiches super tender but not soggy. I know. Straight out of the 60's. But whatever happens inside that magical box, I like it. Sandwiches are never stringy and fatty, always perfection. Great for a quick lunch on the run. 

Give TJ a try - you'll enjoy it ."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab a sandwich in the Cleveland area. I love their southwest turkey Sammich, the corn beef is really good as well its a classic feel to a sandwich  shop. You must try it! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches! The workers are very friendly and do. It rush you as you look over the gigantic menu. I'm interested in going back for the fresh meat selection. You just can't beat these prices."}
{"text":"Best service best corn beef I love this place!!! It's original it really doesn't get any better than this hands down!!"}
{"text":"Best corned beef on the west side, hands down. This is a take-out counter and full service deli, not a restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Once you see the menu, you'll be overwhelmed with amazing deli choices. 
I chose the hook and ladder. 
The roast beef and turkey were high quality and generous. The cheese was a perfect match. The cole slaw is so good I wish I had gotten a side of it; creamy with tons of flavor but didn't make the sandwich soggy. The perfect late breakfast lunch. It's a big sandwich so you need some belly room. 
To top it off, they have amazing cuts of meat that I'll be getting for the grill as soon as it's warm enough. 
The people are super nice, Kevin took the time to answer a bunch of questions about their meat selection. My new favorite sandwich spot in Lakewood. 
If you have the go to the hospital, get yourself a delightful meal afterwards. This is a not-to-be-missed spot in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"The best polish sausage in the area. The fresh sausage is fantastic. The smoked is also good, it just so happens that my preference is fresh. The steaks are always good cuts. I once wanted to make my own philly cheesesteaks at home, the butcher thinly sliced some ribeye steak at my request. The sandwiches are good. The meat here is far superior to Giant Eagle down the street. You don't need to drive all the way to W. 25th for some great meat. The staff is very friendly and can help you out if you want some dead animals to eat."}
{"text":"I came in the day before Christmas Eve. Without placing an order. And asked for a very specific cut. Not only did they serve me. But they served me the best price for an outstanding cut. My family was very impressed. I'll be back. Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a vegetarian...now I'm obsessed with their corned beef sandwiches.  Yeah, they're that good."}
{"text":"Another one of Lakewood's gems. This place is a take out deli with the best huge chicken salad sandwiches. I love the old time candy and chips as well. The big guy that works there is a most helpful and genuine person. I never leave without some cheese, corned beef, pastrami, and turkey breast slices for the kids school lunch."}
