{"text":"I used to work near by , and I would always get my morning start with this place . Sadly my job moved into Charlotte but they still remember me when I come back once in a while to get my drinks while I'm in town over there. They have a really great staff and the decor is really great if you need to study or have a gathering. They really care about their customers and will sure to have you leaving happy with the drinks they make."}
{"text":"I want to like this place.  Really, I do.  I have occasion to visit Kannapolis a few times a month when I'm visiting family.  Even though the parking lot is a little awkward to get in and out of, the location is perfectly situated on my route as an ideal place to kill time if I get to town early.  Every cup of coffee or baked good that I've ever had here has been good.  The decor is a near perfect mix of computer sized table tops and comfy lounging chairs.  I wish I could enjoy it!  HOWEVER, without fail when I go in with the idea that I'm going to get some reading done, or work a bit on my computer while I enjoy my coffee, there is always that one obnoxiously loud person who seems to believe with all his or her heart that getting to over hear them is the absolute highlight of everyone else's day.  There's the woman who wants to have her phone appointments at full volume, the old guy with an over inflated sense of importance for stories about his adult children, and staff of the local hipster church having a staff meeting.  What ever happened to inside voices...?  I think I've finally learned my lesson and will stop teasing myself with the idea that I'm going to be able to have a satisfying experience here."}
{"text":"The French Express mocha (with an extra shot of espresso of course) is great! Atmosphere has a rustic feel making it comfortable to sip and relax. Ryan is fantastic and can create unusual drinks if you are willing to step out of your comfort zone. Definitely my go to coffee shop!"}

{"text":"A great coffee house for Kannapolis.  Locally owned.  Love the design, atmosphere and the coffee.  Would get at least 4 stars even in a major city.  Not much room for me to expand.  If you want a cool place to chill in the area, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Went there for an iced coffee with sugar free syrup they had a ton of the sugar free syrups to choose from and he recommended the hazelnut almond syrup (the nutty professor )!!! I received  it fast with great service and the coffee was the best I've ever had so smooth and amazing. 5 stars for sure!"}

{"text":"I am so glad #MagnoliaEmporium got the opportunity to design this space!  Truly some of the best coffee I have had to date in the country.  I also had the benefit white designing the space to be on the receiving line of most of the drinks that were being tested and created.  I wish my clients nothing but success!  This turned into a real winner!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST COFFEE!!! I don't live in Kannapolis, but I will definitely go out of my way to get coffee here every time I pass by. The coffee was really fresh. The entire cafe was clean and cozy, and the employees were really sweet. I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"I love this little coffee shop. The owner and his mother are incredibly friendly and make great drinks. I recommend ordering a hot white chocolate mocha and add peanut butter syrup- it's delicious and a combination unique to this shop."}
{"text":"For about two years now I have been coming to French express... In the last year it has virtually eliminated the run to Starbucks and for good measure. The Armando's blend is simply one of the better cups coffee you will ever have"}
{"text":"They have Non-dairy options! Awesome atmosphere and nice people, I want to go there more."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and a real great place to chill, drink some coffee, and support a locally owned business!  Don't expect the service of a Starbucks, this place is so much better and the cost is much lower!!  It might be a little slow but it's friendly, eclectic, and what you would want in a neighborhood  coffee house."}
{"text":"Try a frozen PBA, not on the menu but delicious. Nice spot with good WiFi that's not Starbucks or another chain."}
{"text":"Every time i swing thru the drive thru window, I am greeted with a smiling face and friendly conversation. A great pick-me-up today after a long day at work!"}
{"text":"Wow! The owner is so incredibly nice and welcoming. The coffee was impressing. I'm not ever sure what I got, I told him what I liked and what I normally get at Starbucks (yes, I know, roll your eyes I frequent another chain), and this man really listened and delivered exactly what I wanted. I was super impressed and plan on returning!"}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop!  The French express mocha is the best. Iced, frozen, or hot. You can get it year round!  Great service no matter what. Drive thru too!!!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The atmosphere is relaxing and the woman working the counter is lovely. My boyfriend and I shared the frozen white chocolate mocha and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee!  Wife and I are down from New Jersey and decided to stop by for a cup. The owner is a great guy and well versed in coffee. Had the Americana, smooth and rich. The decor is so artful and cool."}
{"text":"Cute place and friendly staff. Went early morning on my way to the airport and there was no wait. Lots to choose from but I tried their specialty mocha with white chocolate and caramel. It was wonderful. Not too sweet and not a ton of foam - yum!"}
{"text":"Recently discovered this cool hang out spot, and I'm not disappointed at all. I ordered an iced hazelnut coffee and it was delicious. The owner of the cafe is very friendly and personable and will strike a conversation with you. This is a family owned business and you can tell they care about their customers.  The ambience is laid back and there are even couches to sit on as well as tables. The prices are reasonable and you're supporting a local business. Definitely my new hang out spot. They no local charity/donation type drives so stop in there sometime and check them out."}
