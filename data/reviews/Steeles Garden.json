{"text":"I was staying at a hotel just a block from here and tired of burgers. Not really a lot of options around here. I ordered the #4 Combination plate (Hunan Beef, S&S chicken, rice and egg roll) to go. The Hunan beef was actually good, the beef was tender and very flavorful. The chicken however was not. They used dark meat which i actually like but every bite had so much cartilage in it i could not really enjoy it. My friend who is from China says that the people there are a lot more tolerant of things like that than we are but i don't eat chicken joints and it totally turns me off. The rice had a strange oil flavor (and i don't mean wok hei) that wasn't very good either. All in all, if you just have to eat Chinese food in this area be prepared for what you get for the price."}
{"text":"It's hard sometimes to find cheap eats in this neighbourhood (Steeles and Weston). So I was delighted to find this restaurant.

Steeles Garden is set up like a food court stand. A lot like Manchu Wok actually. The items are $1.75 each, so you could have a decent sized lunch for around $3 and change. That's cheaper then Manchu Wok, I will point out, and of similar quality.

They have the usual offerings: fried rice, chicken balls, sweet and sour pork etc. It's all sort of greasy, but exactly what you would expect."}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty, good portions. General Tao chicken is their best IMO. They have 2.50 per item lunch special. Usually get fried rice and general Tao chicken for total of $5.65 taxes in."}
{"text":"Good inexpensive Chinese food for a quick lunch. Friendly staff on the most part. Very flavorful but probably has Msg. 

Able to accommodate for vegetarians. Lunch specials on weekdays and I think they do deliveries."}
{"text":"This is a great place. We had the Cantonese Chow Mein and the Pork with Vegetables and Almonds. Excellent. Friendly place. Great food. I wish we lived closer to eat there more often. When we are in the area, we make a special point to order here.  Consistently great."}
{"text":"Just a heads up, if you're coming here for lunch and have a time restriction.. you MIGHT be late getting back.

The line is SUPER long at lunch. When I say long, I mean out the door. 

The lunch special is $2.50 per item. They have a hot table which include items such as;
Fried rice
Szechwan chicken
Chicken wings 
Mixed vegetables 
French fries
Chicken balls
Stir fried beef with mixed vegetables
Egg rolls
Spring rolls 

And a few other more items that I can't remember because my brain is currently full with the items I would get personally.

They put A LOT.. so I usually just get two items but there's no limit! 

Just a heads up, it's VERY salty! Make sure to drink lots of water.

4 Stars due to the price and amount of food they put is just a win.
