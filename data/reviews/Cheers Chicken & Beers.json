{"text":"I ordered 2 chickens for take out to have them at home with my family. I opened one box and started eating the chicken and noticed that the chicken had a smell to it. I didn't think much of it but the smell kept getting stronger as I had more. I finally asked my family if they noticed the same and they all agreed. We called Cheers back the lady there apologized and asked if it was the chicken with bones. She said that the chicken has been out since the morning so that might be the reason why. So we brought back the left over chicken from one box, the new box of chicken that nobody touched and the chicken bones from the first box. They smelled the bones and the left over chicken and said that they couldn't smell anything which is ridiculous. I can describe the smell as ammonia like (ie. Bad chicken or bathroom smell, take your pick) and they straight up lied and said that they couldn't smell it. They eventually gave me the refund for one order of the chicken but not the other. I regret not reporting this place to a health inspector.  First of all, anybody with any common sense knows that you CANNOT leave chicken outside all day long before cooking it. Secondly, if they couldn't smell what the 4 of us were able to smell at home, they are in the wrong business. Thirdly, don't make your customers feel like liars. I had to drive 30 mins to bring the chicken back. Why the hell would I bring the food back if there wasn't anything wrong with it. 
Stay away from this place unless you like foul smelling chicken covered up in sauce. I will NEVER eat or order from this place again."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. I remember having juicy and tasty fried chickens. I just had a take out fried chicken and look how dry it is. Chicken is not even dipped fully with the sauce. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Best Korean fried chicken in GTA. Period. (If you've had better kindly pm me please). Oddly enough this place is nit busy at all. Love it"}
{"text":"BEST KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN IN THE CITY!!!! I asked the very pretty friendly waitress why their sauce is sooo much more superior to the others and she said, it actually comes from KOREA!!! This place gets stars for food and service. I have ONLY gotten served by this very friendly waitress, all the negative reviews I see is due to bad service. I hope they continue to have her as well as only hire great servers."}
{"text":"the food here just soso, dont add fried ricecake it costs $4 and the mount is very little"}
{"text":"A quick update - chicken is too damned good to give it 3/5 stars, so I upgraded to 4/5. Server 'Won' is absolutelya wesome. One thing else to note is that due to the not-so-great ventilation here, your  clothes will smell like chicken when you leave, guranteed. Added a photo too."}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken! So juicy and flavourful! They serve beer too, which obviously goes well with the chicken . 

The music they play here is always super hip and makes for a perfect night out with friends."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend. Ordered the half soya fried chicken & half sweet fried chicken - ~$28 in addition, we got chicken gizzards and a side of veggie sticks ~$4each. 

The chicken was amazing. If anyone do not eat spicy, get the soya- it's sweeter and salty. The sweet had a bit of a kick to it- not too spicy. Excellent chicken. Just remember, it does take them a bit to make it , as I think they make it to order. The gizzards were incorporated into our friend chicken sauces. Veggie sticks- $4 not worth it. 

It comes with side dishes- pickled radish, pasta, coleslaw. (They were Mehhhh) 

We went around 5:30pm, so it was early and not many people were there. The service was 7/10. Got our necessary needs and that's about it. 

I would prob not come back again, unless it was cheaper. Our bill came up to $44 for both of us, with no drinks- just water. So it's a bit pricey. 

The atmosphere is more of a bar-ish eatery. The washrooms was nice though... Haha."}
{"text":"It was 10 at night, and I suddenly had this craving for fried chicken...and what do you know, I found this place right across the street from Yelp!! This is my first experience with Korean fried chicken (usually I just go for the good ol'American). Their smallest portion was half-chicken (for $16.95), which was wayyy too much for a late night snack. But it was late, I didn't wanna drive (or walk) any further, so I sucked it up and decided to try the plain.
I waited for like 15-20 minutes as my chicken was being prepared in the kitchen. There was loud Korean pop playing in the restaurant, the interior was really dark and I'm not here to socialize anyway, so I ordered my chicken to go. The brown meat tasted decent, white was a little dry but that's to be expected. I pitched in my own stash of ketchup since I didn't enjoy the two sauces it came with, and spent FOREVER trying to locate the chicken thigh. Had no success even after the box was emptied. So...maybe they chopped it up and I didn't recognize it...?
Overall the chicken was quite enjoyable, nothing special but nothing to complain about either. But seriously, how bad COULD freshly-fried chicken get?? And for $20? I don't know man, but I might just stick to Popeyes next time:P"}
{"text":"Revisited the restaurant today and the service has improved by A LOT. I am now able to enjoy my chicken in peace."}
{"text":"I visited with my friends again, this time to try the boneless fried chicken. To my surprise, the chicken pieces were juicy and not dry at all. I also liked the grated parmesan cheese and parsley that enhanced the overall flavour of the dish.
Compared to the last visit, it didn't smell bad any more, and it appears the men's room was working fine now. The server was still prompt and responsive, and I enjoyed my time here. I would love to come back."}
{"text":"Came here with a few of my friends bc you can't go wrong with some fried chicken on a Saturday night. 

We ordered boneless chicken in the original flavor and it was pretty darn good. It came with some fries sprinkled on top, so that was a nice addition. Along with this, we ordered a plate of ddukkboki. It wasn't too bad, but I felt like it had too many fillers in there and just not enough of the rice cakes. 

Will probably be back to try their other flavours, without a doubt! Although, I'm sure I'll strictly stick with the chicken."}
{"text":"Location/Service
- On Finch St, near the end of the apt complexes (right beside the 24 hour Korean restaurant / CoCo tea)
- Pretty easy to spot. Inside, like any Korean bars, is dark and loud of K-pop music - it does give a good vibe though. It's not a big restaurant, maybe fit around 20 people or so
- Staff were okay. When I went, only 1 front staff was on duty - so service was a little slow and not as attentive

Food
- Like its name, this place is famous for Korean style Chicken
- It offers fried and non-fried related ones as well, so I tried both!
- The fried chicken were boned with a sweet sauce. There were still a lot of meat on the chicken, not overly battered. The sauce complimented well with the chicken, and it's a sweet tangy feeling to it. Comes with fries
- The other chicken was boneless (mostly thigh and breast meat) mixed with a cheesy sauce and onions. Pretty filling portion and the chicken meat was not dry. Cheesy sauce reminds me of something similar that I can't put my finger on it, but it's good to taste


Overall, it's a pretty chill place to grab a few drinks and chit chat. They have another location, which I'm not exactly sure if the menu/consistency is the same. But this place is pretty similar to other Korean Chicken places within the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Came here by chance on the day it opened. Official grand opening is still a week away so it was a limited menu (only chicken). Don't have beer yet, but they gave us free sodas to make up for it. 

Tried the original and also sweet chicken (whole chicken, half and half). Both were good... I preferred the sweet a little more. Chicken was pretty juicy. Came to about $26 

They also have other items on the menu which should be available after the opening, like Korean soups, squid, gizzard skewers, etc. 

Service seemed friendly. 

Very close to Yonge & Finch TTC. Take credit card. 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh, Korean Fried Chicken. How I love thee. Cheers, Chicken and Beers is just making that love stronger. A small venue with about 12 tables, you WILL have to wait; this place is busy! They don't take reservations for more than 10, so make sure only those with true love for KFC join your party. There is a municipal parking lot next door and free parking on side streets and plaza across the street. 

We ordered 4 whole chickens, 1 of each sauce. Each chicken comes with a healthy portion of fries and some fried rice cakes disguised as fries in the mix. We tried Original($24.95), Sweet, Soy and Spicy($25.95). They are served in pieces in a basket with the fries and the whole lot is tossed it the chosen sauce. LOVE IT!  Only downside is that the fries get soggy after awhile.  What's impressive,  is that there was almost no grease to speak of. For how much fried chicken I've eaten, this brings it to a whole other level. 

When you think Original, don't think plain; these are far from plain. They were dusted with parmesan cheese and scallions. The fries had the parmesan baked in and they weren't salty. Wow, just Wow. The sweet sauce was alright, not a front runner. The spicy sauce made my face hurt. I know, I know, I'm not good at spice, but I definitely drank all of the water on the table and finished my beer. If you like spicy, this is for you! The crowd favourite was Soy. The combo of sweet and salty made this disappear fast.  

The service had a bit of a rocky start, but smoothed out by the time the food came. Like I said, this place is busy! They don't split bills, but as a large group, we're used to it and were prepared.  

Left with a fully belly: mission accomplished."}
{"text":"The bar was not busy at late night but he waitress was ignoring us. Even we ordered the beers she forgot to service us and was on her phone the whole time.  Anyways the chickens are tasty:)"}
{"text":"Dropped in today with a friend after he visited before and highly recommended it. A placed called Chicken and Beers? Love that they were able to avoid copyright infringement, hehehe. 

This was so awesome. There were some setbacks as we tried to order the drumsticks or wings but they were out. Granted we were there late so this is completely understanding and only let's me know I'm not getting frozen crap out of the freezer. The server was cute and was great with us, but just like the other reviewers mentioned, service can be a bit infrequent. So we ordered the boneless combo that came with beer and upgraded to a pitcher and a boneless chicken basket, which surprisingly came with Parmesan fries. The combo had a special sauce and was topped with sliced onions, which is a great thing to cut through the fried chicken. Standard beers on tap, but a great place to fill a craving. Best fried chicken I've enjoyed in a long time...

I also enjoy the K-pop that plays, don't know why, but it sounded great."}
{"text":"This place is great. We ordered half-half, original + chilli. Both flavors are good. The batter was thin, crispy and not greasy, the chicken were quite big chunks and well seasoned, you just couldn't stop eating lol. Their fries looked like machine cut but tasted good.

Will definitely revisit next time!"}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday night. It was not particularly busy, so there was just one person managing the entire floor. But man, was it difficult to get service.

They don't have a lot of options on the menu when it comes to fried chicken....Despite the name...

The chicken comes with fries and radishes. The meat is tender and juicy, and the skin with thin and crisp. The fries were pretty good as well.

It's alright I guess, but you might get better service if you're Korean."}
{"text":"I had called a couple weeks in advance to get seating for 10 and was told I couldn't have that many people and that 8 was the maximum.  I admit I still booked for 10 thinking some would bail as that does happen sometimes and just like an airlines that overbooked I was caught with my pants down... not literally of course.

I had apologized but we managed to squeeze together and the server (who was running the entire floor by the way) was diplomatic about it.  Thanks for allowing us to keep it together.

This place is in a strip mall type complex at the south west corner of Finch and Yonge actually closer to Duplex Ave.  I thought about that for a sec... This is not the same Duplex Ave that runs north and south just west of Yonge all the way from Davisville to Lawrence... no this is a pseudo Duplex Ave made just for Yonge and Finch!  Completely off topic... I know.

Super high ceilings, a narrow footprint and a busy and almost loud atmosphere I felt like we were in the city but this place and area is basically Little Korea North and it's very lively in this part of town.  Cheers is a good example of how this area has changed so much through out the years from when I remember Yonge and Finch being much more tame to being a complete high rise haven that it is now.

For as busy as this place was I could understand how we wouldn't be able to split bills.  I mean under normal circumstances I would have questioned it but it was kind that our server essentially tolerated my borderline and questionable testing of the fire code by seating more than we were \"allowed\".  The saving grace is the entire time we were there there was one table unoccupied so I sort of felt we weren't breaking the laws here.

We ordered a bunch and by a bunch I mean lots of chicken.  What equates to about half a chicken a person we had a table full of baskets mostly family style whole chickens and other sides.  Spicy boneless, original dry, sweet, soy - yum yum yum and yum.  Fries added in each basket to soak up some of the saucy ones and well cooked, deep fried baskets of North York hometown Korean fried chicken.  

Cheers Chicken and Beers is a place for chicken absolutely.  Their tasty chicken ranks right up there for some of the best in town that I've had and I've been to a good bunch.

While it was sometimes hard to get our server I get the fact that the place was near capacity and she was the only one.  We needed lots of water decanter refills and it was hard to get her attention sometimes but overall the food came out rather quickly considering how much we ordered and how many people she also had to serve.

For the amount of chicken we had there was not much in the bones department to have to fill those steel bone vases with.  Most of the bone in pieces were a variety between thigh, drums, split wings, breasts etc.  Mostly good tasting meat, cooked well whether battered or sauced the tastes were great.  Even the sauce was not overkill... I've been to some places where the chicken was literally submerged in sauce, not here... just the right amount.

It would be nice if there were wet naps available though, the chicken as everybody knows can get sticky.  Overall the place for as busy as it was served up some really good Korean fried chicken and I'd recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"Back at my old company, Cheers was our favourite joint to chit chat over drinks.  This was where I first learned about chimaek (Korean fried chicken and beer), and it's my default for this style of dining.  

What's exciting here are the possible combinations. Cheers' chicken platters have boneless, bone-in,  half and half, spicy, sweet, and green onion options.  I recommend getting half and half boneless with green onions on top because you and your company can avoid fighting over the flavours and instead choose two types to share.  

Between the spicy and sweet flavours, I would put my money's worth on the spicy one any day, but I have noticed that the spiciness differed each time I've visited.  The portion-size and presentation also differed, strangely enough.  Now, a change in style is common after a few months or years at any restaurant, but my visits occurred every three weeks.  Therefore, they leave me wondering if the chefs rotate or if I visited during an experimental time for the restaurant. Nevertheless, the chicken here never disappoints. It is always crispy on the outside while being tender on the inside, and it packs a flavourful punch.  

Don't forget to order beer on the side, especially if you're getting spicy food options.  The trick is to dilute the spiciness on your tongue with the beer!   Beer and chicken options are fairly priced compared to costs at other chimaek vendors as well. 

Finally, remember you'll come out smelling like grease (trust me, it will be pungent).  Therefore, plan your visit wisely, making sure you won't be visiting your partner's family or attending an important meeting or crowded event afterwards.  You don't want to embarass yourself!  Alternatively, avoid having the smell cling to your clothes by getting your chicken to go and eating outside.  There is no outdoor seating, so try having a picnic or using your own patio if you have one.  

I've moved, so Cheers isn't very accessible for me.  I crave for it occasionally and will definitely be back when I'm in the area. I highly recommend it for a chimaek experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good however there is room for improvement especially with the service. We got half and half chicken with green onion, half original and half soy. Both were very good and flavourful, not too greasy. We got the boneless one so the chicken pieces were on the small size. The fries were too soft for my liking, I prefer them crispy. 

Service was kinda meh and indifferent, we asked them to explain the menu but they didn't really do a good job explaining and kinda left us on our own. They just didn't really seem to take initiative to sell their stuff. Dropped a star for service.

I still prefer the fry over Cheers but the chicken is still pretty good if you're in the area and you're craving it."}
{"text":"Every review is right about the fried oil in the air getting on your clothes! It was a constant problem in Korea as well and every Korean fried chicken place I've been to here. 

The service was friendly, even gave us a sample of the sauce we wanted to try. The spicy sauce is very spicy. To the point it burns after a few pieces. It was very good though  maybe next time I'll ask for it on the side to dip with the original fried chicken because they drown the chicken in their sawwwce. The sweet sauce was so good. The chicken was battered and seasoned well enough for the crunch even with the sauce. 

 We ordered the half and half for two styles of one whole chicken. With a pitcher of beer it came to about $50.

So it is a form of gourmet fried chicken and trust me I love my KFC and Popeye's, you're definitely paying a premium. As with all things Korean, it is much more expensive here than it is there so after living there.  It's nice for once in awhile and it is comparable to kokoya in price and quality. I think kokoyas spicy sauce has less heat for sure. 

I'd give it more of a 3.5 rating.  Loses points for the bathroom with a  toilet that doesn't flush and prices."}
{"text":"Went with friends for the annual gathering at night. The space is tiny. The time we wait for the food comes was extremely long. But the boneless chicken is so good. Juicy, tender and with the fresh cut green onion. 

But the restaurant was not warm enough! Tonight is -20 and my feet is freezing cold. We all have to wear the winter jacket while we were eating. 

There is no hot water served in the restaurant, they only provide room temperature water. 

Overall the chicken is good and the waitress is nice and friendly.

I would suggest to get take out and enjoy the chicken in your sweet home."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS 

I feel like chicken tonight...like chicken tonight...

Well then come here!  Located in the Yonge/Finch area this place seems to always be busy - arrived at about 7pm and by 8pm it was filled.  It's a relatively small spot so if you have a larger group call ahead for reservations (I believe 8 is the max).

Our group decided to order family style so we could try out their different flavours of fried chicken.

Original-nice crispy coating on the outside and juicy on the inside.  When you can do a 'plain' version well that says a lot to me.

Soy - nicely flavoured and along with Original it was my favourite.  Not overly saucy but a nice mellow flavour

Sweet - overly saucy which I typically don't like.  It was ok but I wouldn't order it again.  All orders come with some fries in top but since this order was heavily sauced the fries in this basket were drenched in sauce and soggy.  Another no no for me.

Hot - they know their heat and if you want to make you lips tingle then go for this.  I could only handle a few as I felt I was getting more burn than flavour (when all you can taste is the spiciness and not the actual flavour)

We also got a few side order of fries and they were hot and crispy and delicious- I could have scarfed these down like no ones business but there were other people at the table...lol

Props to the server - not sure if someone called in sick or what but she was the only one there to serve the entire place.  Of course it was a bit slow but understandable.

A few cons - with a wings place you really should provide more napkins to the table and also some wet wipes would be nice.  Also the water containers and glasses they bring over are TINY (the water glass looked only slightly bigger than a shot glass) big it up and we are good! 

I'd definitely do the Original & Soy chicken again - those were my favourite."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but far from decent. I've been here a handful of times because it's close to home and the quality has been really inconsistent. Sometimes the chickens are spot on, crispy, perfectly fried and juicy on the insider but other times (most of the time...) they're overdone. It really sucks when they're overfried, the skin is tough and lacks crunch and the inside is also tough and dry. It's always a gamble when I come here."}
{"text":"Among the three Korean fried chicken restaurants that my friends introduced me to, I like Cheers Chicken the most.  This is because the cooks at Cheers do 4 things right: 
1) the batter is the thinnest among the 3
2) the crunch remains even with a bit of sauce on top
3) the chicken meat is mostly \"not dry\" versus some restaurants' mostly dry chicken chunks
4) the sauces are to the point: really spicy when it is a \"spicy\" sauce, and really sweet when it is a \"soy\" sauce

We ordered spicy chicken, soy chicken and sweet chicken.  I guessed the cooks didn't dumb down the spiciness level here.  The spicy chicken with cheese was punishingly spicy.  I felt like my mouth could blow fire.  I was surprised that the soy chicken was sweeter than the sweet chicken.  Soy flavour was my favourite.

The place is clean and simple.  The vibe is young and down to earth.  It feels like just one step above an eatery."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout: Original Flavour of Half Chicken, with Add-On of Fried Rice Cake.

Wait time was approximately 15-20 mins. A television blaring K-pop music videos entertained us while we waited. 

For take out orders of chicken, it'll also include: Salad, Pickled Radish, 1 Free Pop, and 10 % off...

We didn't realize this until after we arrived back home that they forgot to include our Pop and take off 10 %...! :/ Boo for that.

Onto the food:
The chicken skin was very crispy and not too oily, and the meat was juicy. The Original sauce that came along with it was tangy and sweet. I preferred the chicken with small dabs of the sauce (it was quite strong in flavour) but my hubby seemed to love it.

The Add-On Fried Rice Cake was a laugh - it came with about 6 pieces of rice cakes mixed with our side of fries. For $4, it's not worth the price. It was lightly fried and simple in flavour.  

The Fries were nice and crispy, though.

Would have rated Chicken and Fries: 3.5, but the missing item/service and underwhelming Rice Cake dropped it down. Would rate 2.5 if option available."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. The customer service was absolutely disgusting from the moment my friends and I stepped in. We were not acknowledged and I understand that there was only 1 person (Maxie) working however she passed by us without a word. Once we were finally seated, it took her ~25 minutes to come take our orders, only AFTER I called out to her for her attention. She then came to the table with menus to tell me that I need to wait and that the orders are done in order, which I found completely bullshit as she served every other table but ignored ours. When we ordered soju, she gave us the bottle without any shot glasses, and when we asked for water, we would have to wait 20-25 minutes. 

The food was just as disappointing and disgusting as the customer service. The chicken was nothing special, and extremely dry. The fries were poorly done as they were stiff and were warm as if they had been aired out for a bit. When the restaurant got a bit less busy, my boyfriend asked the waitress to cancel our other order however she said the order was already being made, which was highly unlikely as the guys in the kitchen were doing nothing but waiting on orders. 

It was only after we paid, that we realized that our order was missing side dishes. Every other table within the restaurant, regardless of the dish, got side dishes along with their meal. So by the time I made my way out of the restaurant, I was furious. 

I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you want poor customer service and crappy food. Save that money and head to The Fry, you'll get more for your buck. Cheers, Cheers."}
{"text":"I think they have one of the best soy chicken! Removed one star as service can be bad sometimes and food flavour can be slightly inconsistent."}
{"text":"Okay, my third and final (hopefully) review for this place is now 3 stars. I didn't get sick this time! Yay! I had to try it again because the fried chicken here is so tasty. Just a heads up, expect to wait about 20 minutes for your order. I've only ordered takeout from here and have never sat in, so I can't really comment on the service.

It's about $30 (including taxes) for a half & half chicken order (two half chickens with two different sauces). I usually order the hot chili (a bit of sweetness and spiciness) and the original. The fries are also crispy and fat--love that. They also give you a small coleslaw, pickled radishes, and a can of pop! I'll probably come here again when I have another fried chicken craving."}
{"text":"The chicken is really delicious, however, their service ruined my whole experience. 

I went there twice, each time I ordered 1 chicken wings to go. First time I went there, there are only two tables, so I thought my order should be quick, I sat beside the kitchen, and looking the server walking back and forth. After half an hour, I found the people came after me have already got the food. Then I asked her to fasten my order, she didn't apologize for my waiting at all, and keep me waiting until another 15 minutes. I was really upset about the service, but I decided to try another time just because the awesome food. Sadly, it turned out the waiting time is still a big problem. I don't know, maybe eating in the restaurant could have a better service, but I rather not try again. Please beware."}
{"text":"Framing chicken mixed a lot of cheese with a kick of heat. It is a lot more spicy than I expected. I wish they have a less spicy version so you can actually enjoy the heat and cheese yet able to taste the chicken. The fry chicken is crispy and juicy. The coating and batter are very thin and light. The batter is definitely lighter than those American restaurant chains. For the garlic Soy chicken, flavor of the soy is mild but loaded with generous amount of garlic compared to other similar type of restaurants.

The restaurant layout is simple that make you feel empty, but the tables actually close enough that you can participate the conversation with the next table. During the time I was sitting in, they actually have more take out orders than people sitting in. As for the price, you are looking at $3 to $5 more than other similar Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"The chicken is amazing, the menu is a bit pricy, and the service is terrible.

We ordered a few different dishes.  The chicken was tender and juicy in all of them and the batter was cooked to a perfect crispiness.  For 3 orders of chicken and 4 beers our total came to around $115.

The service however was awful.  The waitress was inattentive even though the place was empty except for us.  Our beers were brought out much much later even though we ordered them at the start and asked for them to come before the food.

The food is great and I would definitely go back for take out.  If the service improves I'd go here regularly."}
{"text":"Always looking for good Korean fried chicken in and around the GTA, and I think I've found a good one at Cheers. 

Great atmosphere. Game on TV, K-Pop/English mix on the speakers, simple interior design with a touch of the classic wooden pub structure, and GOOD FOOD. 

Chicken: I had the original and the soy whole chicken. Heads up; chicken ALWAYS tastes better off the bone. There is no getting around that. Their batter is very light and crispy. The original flavour is simple and not over-seasoned, focusing on the chicken, with a final pepper taste at the end (beware anti-spicy friends, mine crossed their fingers handling these). The soy is a good alternative. Not heavily covered and not a sweet soy in comparison to other local Korean fried chicken places. A perfect saltiness reminiscent of Memmi broth with a touch of sweetness - at least for me! 

Sides: Fries are soft and fluffy on the inside with a slightly crisp skin. Veggie sticks are minimal. Cabbage salad was nice and light, and you can never go wrong with turnips. The pasta was the tiniest serving ever and tasted like sweet mayo style dressing with a bit of hot pepper paste... I didn't care for it at all. 

Service: not too long of a wait, quick seating, and really nice server who carried her light humour even with an accidental water spill! It was tough being able to see the fryer timer from our seat which made a not so long 20-minute+ wait a longer one,
but it really wasn't so bad. 

Price? Standard pricing in the area a few years ago before the popular \"house of heated flavour\" went up. 

If the sides were better, I'd have given a five. Cheers, Cheers!"}
{"text":"The owner/lady in authority started an argument with me cause i paid 18 cents less in tips, then tried to explain to me that i was legally required to pay more tips cause the food inspector told her so. When i suggested gratuity is my choice and not a service charge and i could even choose not to pay if i wanted to. Thats when she started yelling at me infront of every guest in the restaurant. I have never been in such a ridiculous situation in life. The food and the price is not worth dealing with that behavior. NEVER GOING BACK EVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Not bad chicken. Tried the garlic soy drumsticks which were okay, a little bit too saucy. And also the chilli wings. That was pretty good. I'd probably order the chilli again, it wasn't as spicy as you'd think it would be. More sweet. 

Went on a Friday night are around 9pm and got a table no problem. Our waitress Emily was great and attentive. 

If you check in you can get a free pop!"}
{"text":"We came here because it's the only fried chicken restaurant in the area that takes reservations. We arrived early but didn't have to wait to get our table! They had everything set up for us and gave us additional chairs to leave our coats on. When it came to paying our bill, the waitress helped us split the bill by table then by person. The service here is perfect!

The only downfall was the prices. Compared to competitors, this place is pricey. A combo was around $45 (for one chicken and a pitcher). Also, don't get the original.. I recommend the signature sauces instead. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Went here at around 8pm with a friend. I'd say around half of the restaurant was full, with 1 waitress. My friend and I ordered a full spicy chicken with a side of fries. The waitress warned us that that chicken was going to be really spicy. The size of the fries was smaller than expected. The chicken itself was really spicy, no lie haha bit it was really good! It was around $40 for the chicken itself which is very pricy but it's Korean fried chicken. The complimentary salad they gave us was really really good!"}
{"text":"First time here but a second for my boyfriend. According to him, service was bad both times. Only 1 waitress working (both times), despite it being dinner time. The boneless teriyaki chicken with the melted cheese, sorry forgot the actual name, was really good. I'd order 2 of those next time for sure. I've been to other KFC places and they all had a mix of different cuts of the chicken whereas here at Cheers, you have to pick 1 cut which I personally don't really like but not completely bothered. The timing of food arrival was off, the table who came about 10mins after us received their food first even though we ordered some of the same things. Your meal also comes with complimentary pickled radish, radish slaw, and a little bit of pasta as apps."}
{"text":"The food was good. Ordered the green onion and sweet boneless chicken. This place is nice to just chill and talk without the need to yell because the music is blasting. The menu can be quite confusing since we couldn't see which dishes came with fries on top. Its annoying to not have half half green onion and sweet. Those two, in my opinion, are the best ones. The service tonight was medocre at best considering a second round of side dishes never came not did the server come check on the table often enough to enquire about any more drinks-she was usually standing behind the counter. I probably won't be returning. There's good potential but it's the service that needs to improve for sure"}
{"text":"Yummy Korean Fried Chicken! I wish the whole order could be of dark meat as they were just so juicy inside and crispy outside! Stay away from boneless as those are more white meat chunk and can get really dry.

We ordered half and half (Original and Hot Chili). As usual I like my sauce hot. I expected it to be super hot but it was medium to my standard. I do expect more from Korean restaurant. 

Wait time might be a little long as the chicken was fried when ordered. And it definitely worth the wait.

Service was good and we got to watch the Blue Jay's Wild Card Game..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night to try out their fried chicken and the flavours we had were pretty good. The chili chicken we got came with a bit of fries but the soy garlic one did not. The pieces were a bit small though, I would've liked them to be a bit bigger since we came across some pieces that were just fried batter. We also ordered the cheese corn as a side order but I didn't really like it. The cheese was actually too strong for my liking and the cheese to corn ratio was off as well (not enough corn). I think the server actually forgot to put in our order for the cheese corn because we had to remind her that we were still missing this item and then it came like in 5 mins. Overall, the chicken itself was good but it is bit pricey. The bill came to almost $50 for three items (not including tip)."}
