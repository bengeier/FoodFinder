{"text":"First time bucket of strips and sweet tea

Chicken was great sauce left my wondering what the hype was

Will be back family thought it was very good"}
{"text":"This place was completely dead on a Friday night. 

Better than KFC, but there were not a lot of options. 

The sauce that they put on their chicken sandwich was pretty unique (very peppery), but there's not much else to comment on."}
{"text":"One taste of the Guthrie's sauce immediately brought me back to my college days back in Auburn over 20 years ago! I was so happy that I was in Cleveland for another event so that I could visit this location. IN CLEVELAND! Of all places! 

With a very simple menu, Guthrie's does what they do very well. Freshly prepared chicken fingers, crinkly crinkle fries, refreshing cole slaw, and a piece of toast with just the right amount of crunch. All of this centers around the mysterious and delicious dipping sauce. It's all about the sauce! Make sure the spend just a little bit more to get extra sauce. It just seems like you never have enough. 

Others have tried to imitate, but no one has come close this taste of Alabama."}
{"text":"Damn good. Even though a lot of their customers are people who don't have time to wait in line at Chipotle, Guthrie's is always worth the trip down to the Steelyard. It doesn't feel like fast food and the folks behind the counter are way friendlier than anyone else serving fast food for a five mile radius. 

Get a box (not that you have a lot of options on this menu,) BUT DO NOT GET THE COLE SLAW. IT IS HEINOUS. Instead, you can get extra fries, another cup of dipping sauce, or an extra piece of buttery toast. It makes the box that much more satisfying. Then, take their dipping sauce and mix liberally with Frank's Hot. It's a dangerously good combination."}
{"text":"Delicious and very consistent! The chicken fingers are always great, occasionally they have groupons and text coupons. Great to go!!"}
{"text":"Guthrie's is SOOO good!. The chicken fingers are fried to perfection, the texas toast is just the right combo of buttery goodness and crispy bread, and the SAUCE! It's AMAZING! Hard to describe, but so yummy. Mayo based-yes. But so much more! This place is definitely worth a try! Also the owner is super nice. And they have amazingly good southern sweet tea. I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One of the best fast food chain restaurants. They actually have a few more options than other chicken finger joints (e.g. Raising Cane's), but the chicken fingers and the sauce are what really stand out"}
{"text":"I recently tried the chicken here and WOW!! Try this place .  Way better than the generic places that just put boring chicken in the fryer.  Great people and the owners are great people"}
{"text":"So a radio station I listen to has really been promoting this place, and apparently the advertising worked because it made me really want to try it.  idk if their food is always like this or what, but my overall impression of the food was WOW that was salty!!  My husband was having the same issue.  It wasn't just the chicken fingers, the toast also was very salty, and we couldn't dip the chicken in the sauce because it was adding to the saltiness.  I mean, I wouldn't say i'm somebody who is sensitive to salt, either.  I LOVE really salty french fries, and am totally one to shake some extra salt on my food, but this was just over the top.  We were able to finish the chicken, but not the toast, just too much.  the french fries actually were not salted up, so they were good dipped in the guthrie's sauce, though I generally do not prefer crinkle cut fries.  I definitely agree with other reviewers that I wish they had extra sauce flavor options - some bbq would have been great.

Bottom line: I'd prefer store bought, frozen chicken fingers over this place any day."}
{"text":"I'd never heard of Guthries before their recent Groupon offer.   Honestly, I would never have gone without a Groupon as I'd rather \"spend my calories\" on things other than fried chicken fingers.

Holy moly - these are some good chicken fingers.   I ended up using my Groupon on a salad and a plate for lunch the next day.  Salad was fresh, tasty and a perfect bed for a couple of chopped up chicken fingers.

I'll be back ..."}
{"text":"I got the chicken finger kids meal they have for my daughter. It was good. She liked the chicken a lot. A little on the salty side though. Overall good food :)"}
{"text":"I heard rumors Chick Fila was going to open in Steelyard. But Gutherie's came instead. So without anyone caring I boycotted Gutherie's. Until a power outage affecting only Chipotle next door. Covered in paint stained clothes and starving I went in. The menu has limited choices so I said I'll have what he ordered (the guy in front who the server knew by name) which was a box. Ok the bad first...the \"toast\" is white wonder bread fried possibly in lard. But the rest of the meal was sublime with delicious battered all white meat strips seasoned to perfection and cooked to order. There is a wait so relax especially at lunch hour when the Metro workers with their name tag necklaces arrive but it's so worth it. The cole slaw is good not over salted or drowning in Miracle Whip. It may even have been real mayonnaise. The fries are unfortunately crinkle cut the ONLY thing that made me miss Chick Fila. And the secret sauce and by the way I never eat sauce was good to the last drop. Hey it's the ONLY Gutherie's in Ohio too. Right here in Steelyard!  In OUR hood.Chick Fila is SO common so suburban. Who needs it?"}
{"text":"Ripoff Ripoff Ripoff Ripoff

 3 pieces of chicken some fries $5.59?

 Never coming back again

 Go to Steak and Shake instead and get a better
deal."}
{"text":"I LIKE Guthrie's better than Chik'fil. Tastier chix - luv the toast & the gravy ( order extra gravy) good coleslaw & the crinkle cut fries are good too. Been here twice and the staff was friendly & helpful both times. If you're in the area don't pass up Guthrie's."}
{"text":"If your from the south or have ever lived there then you would think like I thought the first time I went here that Guthrie's is to the North like Zaxby's is to the South.
I've been here several times but on my last visit there was a longgggg wait and only 2 people who came in after me waiting to order. I was compensated by being given a free large drink and a stamped card for a free chicken box meal. They were very courteous and I definitely appreciated the wonderful customer. It actually was some of the best service I've received in a long time and the stamp definitely helped me to fill better about the long wait. 

The food was definitely good. Wish they would expand and get like the Zaxbys of the south and serve hot wings and BBQ wings and make the tenders where you can have them dipped in sauce. The terns have great flavor and the sauce definitely makes the wings taste that much better! A+"}
{"text":"Have been here plenty of times since moving to Cleveland, and I will echo what others have said that it is as close as we can get to Zaxbys up north! Great fried chicken with crinkle cut fries and toast. I would say my only disclaimer going in is that it usually takes awhile to get your food. The last two times I went through the drive thru and even without a line it takes about 10 minutes for food. Hopefully that means the chicken is cooked fresh, but it could be operated a little faster nonetheless."}
{"text":"Chicken Fingers. Crinkle Cut Fries. Coleslaw. Garlic Bread. Sauce.

I was first introduced to this formula as an OSU student in Columbus at Raising Canes.  The two places have almost identical food.  This is the only Guthries in the region.

The star here is the fingers dipped in the special peppery, creamy sauce.  They are lightly breaded, tender, fried chicken fingers.  In my opinion they are better than any other fast food chicken tenders around.  You better be feeling fried chicken because that's all you're going to get here.

The service can be a little slow.  We've had better luck calling ahead and picking up inside than waiting in the drive-thru line."}
{"text":"Omg- so good! If you like fried chicken and yummy fatty fries- come here. We always go to Cains when in Columbus and this the best and nearest thing to it. Steelyard Commons is also worth it as far as places go- great place in downtown Cleveland to shop and have some lunch. These chicken fingers are so fab!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but over 20 minutes spent in the drive thru.  I split a \"box\" and just had an ice tea.  We sat over 20 minutes at the window before getting the food.  The chicken is tasty, small little pieces.  We didn't eat the toast and the fries were okay.  The sauce was good, but on the salty side.  I won't choose to go here, but if someone else wanted to try it, I'd go with them."}
{"text":"Totally love this place!  All their food is always delicious and tasty to eat, and as of course, their freshly-made and freshly-fried, homestyle chicken fingers as well.  You can definitely bet I will be returning here again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"I just went to Guthrie's on my lunch break from work. I had spotted it a few weeks ago when going to Chipotle and all of the awesome reviews and the delicious smell of fried chicken lured me in. I went through the drive-thru so i can take it back to work with me. I ordered a \"box\" from their incredibly simple menu. The box consisted of chicken fingers, crinkle cut fries, cole slaw, Texas toast and their sauce. 

The chicken fingers: tender and juicy, as they should be. They are nicely breaded- not too little, not too much. The breading was a bit salty for my taste. 

Crinkle cut fries: Cloned Orieda frozen fries, deep fried. Nothing special. 

Cole slaw: they put it in the styrofoam box with your hot chicken and fries. So by the time I got back to work it was warm and wilted, otherwise, the flavor was very similar to the coleslaw at KFC. 

Texas toast: really, you cant screw this up. 

Sauce: I'm not sure if you have a choice of sauces, or if this is the only sauce they offer, but it definitely would not be my first choice. I really felt like I was dipping solid grease in a vat of mayonnaise. I'd really appreciate something more along the lines of honey mustard or BBQ sauce for the chicken. 

The service was super friendly. The adorable young girl running the drive-thru was really sweet. 

Overall, I probably won't be back. I just wasn't impressed at all."}
{"text":"I heard about this place via the radio star 102.  i have to say it was worth the drive.  The chicken was moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  The sauce and toast was also excellent.  the staff was pleasant and drive thru window staff was very polite and efficient.   I will definitely be back and tell my friends all about it."}
{"text":"good, inexpensive food. i'm a sucker for crinkle cut fries, so that was a good thing. the chicken was crunchy and tasted good. the coleslaw was my favorite part. creamy and just the way i like it. 

i'd give it 5 stars but the cleanliness of the place was lacking. the tables were sticky and so were the floors. i hope that wasn't a normal thing there. 

i'd go back but would probably go through the drive thru."}
{"text":"Usually my go to when I don't bring a lunch. Chicken is excellent.... Always hot and fresh to go with their dipping sauce. 

Fries are a little off.... Something with the taste doesn't vibe for me


Staff is friendly and tho it's fast food, the chicken is made to order"}
{"text":"I got a Snack box. It was okay. Very filling even though it was only 3 chicken fingers and fries. But I felt like the chicken was a little dry and too salty. The sauce was decent. After trying Raising Cane's, I definitely prefer that over Guthrie's. The service was great and fast."}
{"text":"Best chick tenders in the city! I tried this place out after I saw chipotle had an insane line. I figured I would just try it and it turned out to be worth the trip. The wait is a little long but that's because they don't pre cook the chicken. The menu is small too but this is a chick tender joint so I'm not going to take a star away for that.   Another reason to come here is the workers because they are pleasant! I've never dealt with drive thru personnel so courteous.  I come here so often that I have a guthries card that gets me a free meal after 5 visits."}
{"text":"WHAT A NICE EXPERIENCE:  QUALITY FOOD, GREAT SERVICE!

We were in the Steelyard area and needed to get something light to eat.  By light, I mean small serving, snack size.  We decided on Guthrie's because it just seemed easy and my husband wanted some chicken strips.  This was our first time eating at Guthrie's so we did not know what to expect.  We placed our order of two snack baskets (which consisted of three strips and fries), and took a seat.  It took a while for the food to be prepared and in the meantime, we noticed quite a few customers coming in at 2 pm  When the food was ready, my husband returned to the counter to pick it up.  It was piping hot.

The strips were fresh and delicious!  They were nicely prepared with a light breading and an appropriate amount of salt.  The crinkle fries which I don't normally eat were actually very good as well.  Lightly seasoned and perfectly cooked. Nothing was greasy or overdone.  We just fell in love with this chicken!!

Unfortunately, this restaurant is new to the state of Ohio and we could not find another location in the area.  Surprisingly, this restaurant is located in Georgia so we will definitely be looking them up when we get home.  Good job Guthrie!

***The menu is very limited and they only offer chicken strips, so if strips are what you want, you are good to go!

***The serving of coleslaw is very tiny and they don't fill up the container.  Insist that they fill it up!

***I found their signature sauce to be a bit \"one note\" but when I added two parts ketchup, it was the perfect dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Its a no from me. I wasnt wow'd by this place. The reviews rant and rave but for me it was bland and for me i could have made way better at home.

Theres only like 6 tables, some outdoor seating, but if youre here during lunch forget about getting a seat.

The menu is extremely limited, which i get it, it allows them to make their \"specialty\" and keep it good. i got a 3 piece with fries and sweet tea.

First of all, my fries came out so soggy, they were like ora ida crinkle fries, definetly not seasoned. not at all anything to brag about.

my tenders were overcooked, burnt almost, and served with their famous \"sauce\" only one cup for 3 tenders? what is this mcdonalds?! i was annoyed the entire meal.

Service was fast but not friendly. I wont be back. Ill stick to KFC or popyes."}
{"text":"Love the food, ok with the wait because I know they are making it when I order. Needs to add wifi. Prices are a bit high, but I do keep returning. Wish they would come to Lorain County, Ohio."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum. This place is great amazing chicken amazing BBQ sauce and really nice workers. They hooked us up with some extra goodies too. YuMmmmMmmMm"}
{"text":"Yes, we know they are only chicken fingers but we've been enjoying them a lot. Simple menu. How many do you want? Very good Texas Toast. Just the fries are ok. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. Other than being freshly cooked, there was nothing special about these chicken fingers. Staff was very nice, fingers cooked to order, but, no special flavor,  no seasoned batter, no special crunch.
 Their homemade sauce tasted just like the Frank's Redhot on the counter. Was hoping for something more unique after what I had read. Nothing wrong with the place or food, just nothing special. Probably great for kids though due to freshness and lack of spice/seasoning."}
{"text":"The chicken is good the menu is very small either tenders or a chicken sandwich other than that it's official"}
{"text":"I was told this place could be compared to Raising Canes! I'm going to have to disagree. The Texas toast wasn't even as good as Canes and I had to order the meal with more tenders than I wanted to get it. The one plus is that it was hot, as it should be based on the wait time. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken fingers! The place is a bit slow but its worth the wait. All their chicken is freshly hand breaded and fried once you place your order.
It comes out hot and fresh. It's also very tender and moist on the inside. The chicken is all white meat and is seasoned very well. Breading is also light and crunchy. The color is perfect out of the fryer. You can choose from 5 different sauces, my favorite is their own Guthrie's sauce. The first time I was here, I had the meal with sides. The sides were OK, but I would skip them and get extra fingers.

My only compliant is that its a bit on the expensive side (I can eat 10 of these fingers easily) but this place offers Groupon pretty frequently so that softens the cost. Excellent alternative if you happen to run into an extremely long line next door (Chipotle)!"}
{"text":"In the many decades of my life I have been raided by police, refused graduation by the College of Business at Ohio University, labeled with an abnormal mental condition by the American Psychological Association, told by the God of my childhood I was an abomination, and most recently witnessed a chicken joint proudly encourage intolerance and hate toward me. No matter I remain as gay as ever and am a happy member of the gentle subgroup who improves neighborhoods, excels in the arts, abhors violence, takes care of its own, and is remarkably funny. 

I have returned to Guthrie's several times over the past weeks. For quality and price it is unbeatable. Guthrie's will be my place for chicken. Unless?"}
{"text":"We are the only ones in the place on the Saturday evening before Christmas.. the place is dead. However, the chicken is super moist on the inside & perfectly crunchy on the outside. They cook it fresh to order, so it takes about 5-7 mins to get your food. It's not phenomenal, but I'd come back again :)"}
{"text":"I first heard about this place through an ad in scene magazine. As a lifetime 'chicken finger fan' I decided to check it out on my birthday. I went with a friend who had been a vegetarian for 14 years and had never experienced fried chicken. We were blown away and have been back so many times since then. The manager is friendly and everyone seems to enjoy working there. I cannot recommend this place enough. The sauce is incredible. I wish I could figure out how to make it myself! Their social media is really funny, too. @reply them... They will answer!

UPDATE: Their instagram person has deemed me their spokesmodel and had given me a free shirt."}
{"text":"I will start out and say I go here all the time.  Not happy on the way I was treated here tonight.  The girl who took my order was completely rude. She was back talking to the kitchen workers and not watching the front at all. I stood there for a while before she came out to take my order. She said may I help you so I gave her my order.  She said I not talking to you. Then became rude to me like I knew she is on the headset. Food was great as always. They definitely need to retrain this employee in customer  service."}
{"text":"Big fan of Guthrie's!  Their chicken fingers are pretty damn tasty.  A bit on the salty side so I would recommend a big glass of water before, during and after your meal.  And if you have high blood pressure, make sure you take your meds right before you eat lol.  

But man is it good.  The normal \"box\" meal is 5 fingers, fries and a piece of toast.  The family serving is the box times 5.  25 fingers, 5 pieces of toast and friesx5.  That gets a little pricey, around $30 or so (as fast food goes), but worth it and more than enough if you are feeding 4-5 people.  

I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the drive through can take a while (because its being cooked to order) and the both times I was in the drive through line the cashier miscounted my change.  Mildly annoying yes, but she caught it before I did. 

I can really recommend this place if you are in the area, Steelyard isn't really around anything in particular, or if you are just craving some good ol fashioned comfort food and willing to make the drive.  

It's worth it."}
{"text":"Monday/lunch - not too busy.  Food came out about 10 minutes after ordering, which sounds par for the course.  It was worth the wait.  Quality pieces of chicken that puts fast food to shame.  The fries go well with their special sauce (thanks for the Franks Red Hot tip, too).  I didn't find the cole slaw too offensive, although I know some people don't like it too wet.

Good value for the quality.  Just wish they had a couple more locations...I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's pretty much exactly like Raising Cane's in Columbus which is perfect, as there is no Cane's in the Cleveland area.  Everything fresh and delicious.  It takes me back to my college days at OSU."}
{"text":"Damn good chicken fingers! Staff are nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Let me just preface that I eat chicken fingers maybe 2x a year  is when  my nephews can not finish them.  I kind of believe after the age of twelve you just should not be ordering these over breaded frozen fried pieces of kids food!

Wholey shit, these are good. Chicken mofo fingers! Some of the best chicken fingers I have scarfed down.Fresh, perfect breading and crispy ratio. everything is made fresh. Melt in your mouth,chicken goodness.  This is sushi slut approved for children and adults!

This place only has chicken fingers,(grilled and or fried) so if you want, lets say, a burger and some jalapeno poppers, you aint gonna find it at Gutherie's.  The dipping sauce is great, a peppery mayo is how I would describe it.  If you are at Steelyard, this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I think these are as mediocre as chicken fingers can get. They are just bland. The chicken tender packs come with crinkle cut fries. Meh. There is nothing special about either of them, the wait time is usually long and service is very hit or miss. My fiance is inexplicably a huge fan of the chicken fingers, though. I don't get it but apparently if you are a connoisseur of the chicken tender, this is worth trying. On our last visit, we talked to a guy from Akron who had heard how awesome Guthrie's was and tried it on his latest visit. My guess is he was disappointed."}
{"text":"They have great deals via Groupon and other social media sites which makes this worth it for me but otherwise its kinda steep for junkfood.  The same girl was working both times I came in and she couldnt be sweeter.  Any employer would be so lucky to have her working for them.  The food is all fried and the fries seriously are the same crinkle-cut, frozen joints we ate in school.  Chicken is good and secret sauce is OK...seems mayonase based.  Im not an uppity health food twat but I have to be in the mood for this heavy, grease bomb.  I always feel full and queasy after I leave here.  Maybe the 3 40s of Kobra I took to the head the night before and the wet I smoked with my dude Tito behind the Lido dumpster had me feeling a little \"off\"?"}
{"text":"They must have adjusted the amount of pepper used in the sauce, because it has been much better since my initial review. I've probably visited Guthrie's at least once a month since then and it's always great."}
{"text":"This looks like school cafeteria food there's nothing to it, but frozen fries and chicken fingers."}
{"text":"I love the simple menu. Chicken fingers, crinkle cut fries, Texas toast and cole slaw. The small menu allows them to focus on making a few fantastic items instead of a bunch average items.

Let's talk a little about the chicken. This is cooked to order and you can taste that it is. Whole pieces of chicken tenderloin and not the formed bits. Lightly battered GBD and tender.

The crinkle cut fries are done just right. Not soggy or not dried out over done. The cole slaw has a balanced taste with the right amount of vinegar acid and mayo taste. Texas toast is buttery and toasted on one side.  The dipping sauce for the chicken is unique and delicious. I can tell it is mayo based and completely different than your typical BBQ or honey mustard sauce. 

We have been here several times and each time we received excellent service. Very courteous staff and they followed up with us to make sure everything was okay as we were eating."}
{"text":"The chicken is to die for and with all those sauces, you can relish in them. Cole slaw is just perfect in the amount of mayo. As for the fries and toast, they're fine. But those chicken tenders, which I'm pretty sure are cooked to order since both times I went to the drive through I waited probably around 8 minutes each time, are amaze-balls."}
{"text":"Exactly like canes down in Columbus. Really good but expensive for what it is. It's a nice alternative for when the chipotle next door has a line wrapped around the building."}
{"text":"Oh yeah! Crazy good chicken fingers. You can tell the chicken they use is fresh and high-quality because the meat is melt-in-your-mouth good and the breading is just right -  light and perfect. These are nothing like the frozen dried-out mess you get at most restaurants for 'chicken tenders' - nothing tender about them. 

Sean and I stopped in for a quick bite before heading to Playhouse Square for an event - because nothing says class like fast food from Steelyard Commons.....but hey whatever. We both went with the 'box' which gets you 5 pieces of chicken, fries, a piece of toasted bread, cole slaw and sauce. PLENTY of food for both of us. I was pretty full and for $6.45, not bad at all. 

The coleslaw was average but nothing wrong with it - not super goopy so that was good. I hate goopy coleslaw. The sauce they come with is tangy and peppery. I really do like it but I'm a sauce junkie so more options would be great - I just like to be ADHD when it comes to sauces. The fries are kind of same-old crinkle cut but they were crispy and tasty, not soggy like many crinkle cuts you get other places. Fried bread is totally wrong but oh-so-good. Basically grease dripping from it but damn is it tasty. 

Overall, we highly recommend you try some fast-food from Guthries. The menu is super limited but if you've got a good thing going, just go with it. The service was fast and friendly - they'll even let you try a chicken sample before you buy! Get in there and get your fat-kid on."}
{"text":"I went there at 1pm on a Saturday and I was the only one there, and service was quick as a result.

I got the 5 tenders, fries, toast, and sauce deal which was $8. Great deal in my opinion.

Tenders were fantastic. On par with Cane's and Popeyes.

Fries were good, not great. I'm a huge fries guy and I thought they could be better seasoned, but they certainly we're not bad.

Toast was meh. Felt like wonder bread with garlic powder and butter. I understand that's basically all Texas toast is but Cane's pulls it off better.

Sauce tasted identical to Cane's sauce. Not my favorite, would have preferred some sort of BBQ sauce. Very creamy and mayo-y, which is not too my tastes.

Overall there is some room for improvement but it's still a very good resturant for those of us on #teamtendies."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Guthrie's. The restaurant was empty of customers when we arrived, but it was 3:30 pm in the afternoon. 

I had the 3 piece fingers with fries and a drink. It was pretty good, but I would have to say I like Popeyes better.

The food was ready quickly and the restaurant was fairly clean. The service was good. The one drawback was the serving trays. They were sticky, smelly, and just felt sort of slimy. They needed a good washing in some hot soapy water and some sanitizer instead of being wiped off with a rag.

I might go back but it was nothing above average."}
{"text":"I took the 30  mile drive today to sample Gutherie's Chicken Fingers after reading all the reviews.  The bottom line: let's call it ok.  The toast: great. The chicken: ok, decent flavor in coating, a little salty. The fries: soft and tender inside, could have a bit more crisp on the exterior.  The cole slaw: decent, not over the top with the horse radish, an even handed commercial slaw, but not artisan.  The chipotle-mayo-pepper sauce was pretty decent, with a very crisp pepper tone.

As others have mentioned, the chicken fingers are a little skimpy in size given the final bottom line price.  My plate and drink was a bit under $10.  Gutherie's is definitely not a \"destination restaurant\" but will do for a working lunch.  The staff was very pleasant, and the restaurant clean and tidy.  Next to each table is a different \"black board\" type wall treatment where you can leave a note or play tic tac toe.  This was my first time in the \"steelyard\" district of Cleveland, and it was very pleasant."}
{"text":"These are some solid chicken tenders, let me tell ya!  The fries were great too.  My son's favorite foods are chicken tenders and fries.  I took him here just so he could order these two things, and that he did.  

While we were sitting there eating, approximately 20 police officers on bicycles rolled up as they were patrolling for the Republican National Convention.  That was a sight to see.

The toast, cole slaw, and chicken tenders were very good.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"My sister and I missed our bus, and the next one wasn't coming for an hour. Guthries was one of the only places open In the Steelyard and this time of night. 

The woman who was at the register was very sweet. She checked on us several times (probably because we were pretty much frozen.) And even gave us a free drink with our meal.

The food was done within minutes. I don't even care if it was cooked hours ago, that chicken is goooooood. Plus they have these bubbles on the wall sorta, and chalk on the tables. What other restraunt let's you draw on their walls??"}
{"text":"A true southern classic. Makes such a shitty place like Steelyard a tolerable place. Almost makes up for the hell hole that is Stealyard."}
{"text":"Actually real chicken breast, chicken fingers are great. Dipping sauce for chicken fingers taste great. Fries are not all that good."}
{"text":"We have ordered office meeting lunches from Guthrie's a few times.  What stands out to me here is the service, rather than the food.  The staff is always great and they get the multiple orders correct.  If you call ahead, it will be ready on time.

Guthrie's offers a very limited menu.  Basically chicken fingers, fries, toast, a chicken finger sandwich and cole slaw.  Really, this about sums it up.    Last time, I ordered the chicken fingers and cole slaw.  The chicken fingers are crispy and made with real chicken breast strips.  The fries are crinkle cut and I suspect from a frozen bag. The fries were kind of limp and not golden brown.  IMO not worth the calories.  The cole slaw is okay.

Overall, if you are craving chicken strips, check out Guthrie's.  I definitely feel they are a step above many other fast food burger places and the Colonel."}
{"text":"Not bad, but certainly not the best chicken fingers I've ever had. If you're going to limit yourself to one thing, you better be the best to keep my attention. 

I was hoping Guthrie's would be a satisfactory substitute or total replacement for my Raising Canes addiction. (Sadly, the closest they are is in Columbus.) 

I ordered up a box meal to try out all the key menu offerings. 

The tenders were SMALL and a bit too salty, but fresh and well fried. 

The toast was \"eh.\"

The coleslaw was a bit too chunky and could've done with a bit more chopping, but the dressing was an unsurprising and basic creamy commercial sauce.

The crinkle fries were wimpy and under seasoned. (Perhaps they could borrow some sodium love from the tenders?)

The Guthrie's sauce had an ok flavor, but lacked the 'OMG I could dip a flip flop in this and eat it' quality I've felt when eating other sauces. 

All-in-all a better option than fast food tenders when the craving strikes and you're in the Steelyard area, but not someplace I'll be going out go my way for again."}
{"text":"Just like canes, fresh, delicious and chicken fried goodness. And I beat Kevin at tic tac toe on the chalkboard. BooYAAA"}
{"text":"Slow window service when we went- but the food is worth it! We were in Cleveland on a weekend trip and came to Guthrie's twice. We're big fans. And if we find ourselves near another Guthrie's, we will be sure to stop."}
{"text":"No bad service here, the cashier was friendly and talkative. I was super curious about trying this place out. I got the meal with the five tenders, texas toast, slaw and fries.  I thought it was pretty decent...nothing to go back running to."}
