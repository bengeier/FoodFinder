{"text":"Lunch on a Friday, the place was deserted. Condiment bottles were filthy. The burgers we ordered were dry and not very well seasoned. Take note of the dead plant as you enter the restaurant....it shows the level of attention given in general."}
{"text":"Fantastic Jambalaya, great poutine. very well priced. Overall a great place to go for a family dinner."}
{"text":"This was the first meal I had in Toronto and it was delicious. I ordered the Nacho Burger and would definitely get it again. Nice drink list and good food.   I would be careful at night, many not so safe street wanderers came in looking for water and asking to use the bathroom."}
{"text":"On Saturday, June 16, 2012, I had a craving for Pork Ribs and Chicken and stopped in at Casey's Bar & Grill. This place was packed with all age groups, young couples, clean & tidy and was greeted within seconds by the Manager - Gregory. Under new Management and staff. The staff was friendly, polite, professional and knowledgeable about their menus and recommendations. The menus were easy to read and competitively priced.  I had ordered their Chicken and Ribs combo. I didn't have to wait long even though the place was pack with people.  The Chicken was evenly cooked, skin crispy and well seasoned. The vegetables were nicely steamed. For desert I ordered a Strawberry Shortcake. I was impressed on how well everything was presented on the plate and the overall taste of the food. It looks like the the Chef really loves his job. I have been there two more times and recommend everyone to try Casey's Bar & Grill on Bovaired Dr. E & Great Lakes Drive 905-799-3464."}
{"text":"Part of me can't believe that this place has gotten such high reviews.  It wasn't horrible, but definitely not the shining experience that everyone else seems to have experienced.  My boyfriend had received a gift card for Casey's so we decided to go before meeting up with some friends.  There are no Casey's restaurants in South Mississauga, so getting to any location is a bit of a hike.    We both ordered off the seasonal menu.  I ordered the pork medallions with sweet potato mash and TM ordered the lobster mac and cheese.  I enjoyed my meal.  The meat and red wine sauce were great (especially since it was a chain bar/restaurant) and I'm a sucker for anything with sweet potato.  TM on the other hand had the opposite experience.  He couldn't even finish half of his meal as it started to make him gag.  Personally, I didn't blame him.  The sauce was more cream than cheese and the lobster was tasteless with an odd texture - somewhere between rubbery and moist.  There was a breadcrumb topping, but it lacked flavour as well.  The only thing edible about it was the side salad it came with.  Now, I can forgive a bad dish, especially when the other was good.  Sometimes things happen.  What I can't forgive is slow service, especially in a half empty restaurant.  We waiting close to 30 minutes for our food and another 20 minutes after eating for the bill.  Once we were all ready to pay, I had to hunt down our waiter to process the payment because he failed to come back to us.  I found him chatting with a friend of his.  Sorry to interrupt your conversation!  The real disappointment was finding out AFTER we paid that the gift card was also good at Fionn MacCool's and other restaurants.  Ah well - lesson learned to always read the fine print."}
{"text":"Went there to meet up with some buddies for patio drinks and food. The patio isn't the biggest but is still pretty nice. Ordered a thai salad but it took a long time to come out. However the salad was delicious with a good assortment of ingredients. would definitely recommend this place and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was there Thursday Dec 1 watching the NFL game. Service was very slow and inattentive. Dinning room seemed empty but bar area was full and only serviced by 1 bartender. My wife and Daughter joined me later only to be told they have to order from the bartender as the passing waitress does not work in that section. In a plaza where there are 4 pub style restaurants, something needs to be done to rise above."}
{"text":"I went on a week day and the place was empty. Ordered a burger an it was really good. Their potato skin appetizer is really good ask the server for the actual name."}
{"text":"This might be the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant.  I arrived with a large party and was asked to order after a few minutes. I decided on ordering something quick and simple as I had to leave in 90 minutes (I figured this would give me plenty of time). Unfortunately, while the rest of my table was given their appetizers and meals I was left waiting and wondering. I politely inquired about the status of my burger after about an hour and was told that \"it's coming\". A half hour passed and I had to leave, I did find out that my burger came out about a half hour after I left. For all of those still reading.. that is two hours for a burger.  I cannot comment on the quality of the food (obviously) and I would recommend that you stay faraway from this place if you care about your schedule, and sanity."}
{"text":"nice place to eat, don't have to wait too long, waitresses always seem to be in a hurry.  you will get served faster if you go to the bar area. also the burgers are hilariously small compared to their sandwiches, their nachos are decent, would not recommend pastas. Appetizers are nice but pricey."}
{"text":"I'm wondering if this is just how Toronto sports bars like their veggie burgers: with a greasy egg bun. Definitely not my favourite bun style. The burger itself was fine, and I liked the fried vegetables that topped the burger. Even if the whole thing was kind of a mess. The service was a little slow, but I was probably the only one who thought so. Everyone else was working on giant pints of beer with their lunch. The server took my complaint/observation about the bun, and said customers picked it over some other bun options, so I was definitely in the minority. (They actually feature the bun style prominently in their menu.) A couple days later I'm back for dinner, this time I order the vegetable pad thai. Service is quick and friendly and the pad thai is great. It's mostly carrots and rice noodles, with some tofu cubes and other vegetables. The trio of mini cheesecakes looks like an awesome dessert as I see someone walking it past, but I select the Apple Mary, which is kind of an apple crisp: baked apples with oatmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla ice cream. I opted out of the ice cream, and I imagine it would have added a certain something. The dessert seemed freshly baked and warm, and it might have served two if you added ice cream to it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great meeting location. I go at least once a week from 2-5pm for the 1/2 price appetizers. Love their burgers. Only complaint would be that they could give you a bit more fries with your burger."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and the menu was diverse. Location is very attractive if you are staying at the Hilton Garden inn~ same building. Good service and well-poured drinks. They had a $5 vodka drink special which is typically unusual~ so that was a bonus. Two meals for dinner cost us $36; minus the vodka :)"}
{"text":"Food options are 7-8/10. They need better dessert options. Veggie options half decent. The discount on before before the evening is awesome! I wish nachos was on the $6 day time list. Service in the bar side is always quick. The staff is knowledgeable about the whole menu and break down options quick to process the orders fast so you are not wasting long. Cooking time is standard doesn't get any quicker. Mangers are friendly and actually help out the staff when it's super busy. Which you won't see much of anywhere. Way better service then the east sides next to it."}
{"text":"Asked for a Jameson on the rocks, got it straight up. When i asked once again to have it on the rocks, the bartender shouted \"you should have asked for that\" over her shoulder. Very rude."}
{"text":"One word to describe my dinner experience here is...  Meh.  It was nothing worth repeating a visit. Nothing blew me away and nothing was nasty or anything like that, but nothing was memorable either.  I'm often baffled when I discover American cuisine restaurants have added \"Asian Inspired\" items to their menu. I had the wonton shrimps accompanied with chow mein. The wonton shrimps were pretty good, but the chow mein was not-so-good.   Casey's I suggest you do some research. Try a couple mom and pop Chinese restaurants or go to a mall food court to consume some Manchu Wok. Yes, Manchu Wok's chow mein is nothing close to the chow mein served at authentic Chinese restaurants. But news flash Caseys: you don't serve either version of chow mein. And for that, I think you should NOT call yours chow mein. Ya hear me!  As for dessert, I don't consider store bought cakes and calling it your own considered quality dessert unless you're bringing it to a potluck. Ladies and gents I know it sounds good, but take my advice when I say pass on the mini peanut butter brownie sundae."}
{"text":"Thanks to a WagJag deal my husband and I went here twice. Both times for dinner.  The first time, we shared the Burger2 with fries.  We also ordered a side of sauteed veggies extra. I was not a big fan of the burger since I felt it was kind of bland.  I can't put my finger on it, but something was missing. I just didn't enjoy it very much. The fries were great though. Golden and crispy - just the way I like it. The veggies were very good as well. They had a nice flavor.  The second time around, we got the Chicken Quesadilla to start with and we shared the Turkey Burger with fries for the main. The quesadilla was great! It came with a really enjoyable salsa too. Definetely something I would order again. The burger was decent, the fries were as good as the first time.   Their service was good both times. Menus and food came quickly. The waiters were friendly and attentive.  The second evening, the manager even thanked us several times for coming. Redeeming our vouchers was no issue at all.   My verdict:  Definitely not a bad place to have quick dinner."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner with my friend and everything was alright.  I ordered shrimp tacos (which were good), French onion soup and tornado potatoes.  My potatoes were a bit too over done as you can see in the picture.  We pretty much saw our server when we first came in, ordered our drinks and when we paid our bill.  The other servers were the ones bringing out our food and brought us water in case we asked for it later.  Our server didn't come to ask if everything was ok after we got our food.  When we were done, another server had to ask if our server came out and had to go get her for us to pay.    Overall, food was good but service could have been more attentive from our actual server."}
{"text":"I feel a little harsh giving the place a 2, but ultimately I don't a have a great desire to return, nor would recommend the place.  My wife and I were craving wings, but we also had the kids along so we thought this place would address all those needs.  We ordered the shrimp tacos, tornado potatoes, wings and the kids had the cheeseburger sliders.  I wasn't expecting full authenticity from the shrimp tacos as though I were on the beach on the Baja de California, but these were even more 'white people food' than I bargained for. The dressing tasted as though it were made by Kraft and mango salsa was too mild - with the mango being far too tasteless. I don't even know if the battered shrimp were seasoned.   The tornado potatoes were not what I was expecting, as I believe there's something of the same name sold at summer festivals with the stacked layers of fried potato. These seemed like paper thin pieces of potato, battered and fried. The result is something that simply tastes like simply over-fried batter as a conduit for dipping sauce. Little actual taste and just a lot of layers fat and oil.  A credit to our server, who was great throughout the night, who replaced them with the suggested spinach dip which was okay.  The wings were pretty good and we tried both the battered and regular types. I like how the hot sauce also had a bit of creaminess to it. I also like that they have a $1 option to upsize any beer.  A few positives there, but the lows were, were well, pretty low. I get the sense that the flavours for most dishes are very mild and not altogether interesting. I may consider returning for Thursday wing nights, but not too much else."}
{"text":"As one ca see from past activity I once was a regular here. Am rather upset that no one told me location was closing. Maybe staff didn't know, but the owner should have told regulars. Now I have no way of getting in touch with a couple of the staff, whom I considered friends. If we knew this was coming we would have exchanged contact information! A pox on the owner of this location."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since visiting a Casey's and now I remember why. My friend and I came here for a quick lunch and we left still hungry. We both ordered a pasta dish and in comparison to other similar restaurants (Jack's, Pickle Barrel, Milestones etc.), the portion was really small but with the same price. The service was mediocre at best. Never again"}
{"text":"We we're heading to Montana's but they were busy. Headed over to east side Mario's and they were busy too, did not want to visit caseys based on the rating but they had no lineup.   Upon arrival there was a wait, but they had a table for my party right away which was great! We were starting the night here before going out! Caseys has a drink and app promo which runs until 6pm for $6. We ordered Cesar's, Asian calamari and deep fried pickles. For our meal we all got platters. You can choose two things: 1/4 ribs 1/4 chicken pulled pork & 5 chicken strips. I got ribs and 1/4 chicken which also comes with two sides all for $25!   The apps came out within 5 minutes and the server was very attentive and served us drinks quickly. Our meals came out and they were very good, Great tasting !   Not sure why the low rating but this experience was far better than Montana's or east side Mario's! I enjoyed the flavours and the perfectly braised ribs! Even tho the apps were on promo they did not served as a \"promo size\" app.   This restaurant got 4* and not 5 because the restaurant is a bit weary and needs some upkeep (looked like our booth was ripping off the wall). Regardless, the food and service was better than other places in this plaza! Definitely will visit again! Great service"}
{"text":"My friend and I were staying in the attached hotel, so we decided to check out Casey's Bar & Grill - as it was convenient and we'd never been to one.    We got seated fairly quickly, which was nice.  The waiter started out well, coming to get our drink and dinner order... then it all went down from there.  We both ordered the Cashew Chicken Stir Fry.  It took a long time for our food to arrive.  And the clock was ticking for us - we had a concert to get to.  They weren't even very busy.    The food finally arrived.  We were starving and glad to have it, but it was only a mediocre dish and I wouldn't order it again.    We had both finished eating what we wanted and were waiting for our waiter to show up again, so we could get some to-go containers and our check... we waited... we waited... where was this guy?  We finally stopped another waitress and asked for our check.  So, yes, the service definitely left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This bar & grill is right next door to the Hilton Garden Inn, so it's convenient if you're staying at this hotel.  It's so close to the hotel that the wifi still works inside the restaurant.  I stopped by here for a drink to take a break from work on a week night.  There were a just few diners there and nobody sitting by the bar.  It was nice to have the area all to myself.  The young bartender did a great job making my dirty gin martini.  For a single Bombay, it was about $9.    On a different night, I stopped by an ordered a Bloody Mary and the bartender recommended a Cesar instead, which is a Bloody Mary made with clamato juice instead of tomato juice.  It was very good, slightly spicy and garnished with celery and a pickled green bean.  This was my first time trying a pickled green bean and I thought it complimented the drink very well.  A glass of Cesar is about $8.  They have $4 drink specials on Thursdays, so I might have to check that out sometime."}
{"text":"This place is attached to my hotel and there's nothing else around (unless you think Tim Horton's counts. I can't see that sign without feeling like I need to stop to pee on the New Jersey Turnpike. I digress.) OK- so low expectations but it was good. Beef tenderloin salad was nice albeit a little garlic laden. Wine selection decent for a bar and grill. Service terrific. I would eat there again but I might not stay this far off the beaten path again."}
{"text":"Good lord is this a dodgy area.  First time in my life I have seen ladies of the evening at a Casey's.   LOLOL!   This was the meeting spot for an office function.  Next time, not so much.  I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Here's a big \"amen\" to Maureen P's review. You got it exactly right.   In my particular experience, it was the \"Asian inspired\" Spicy Korean Beef. No, it didn't exactly make me sick (although the price almost did). But anyone with any first hand experience of Korean cuisine -- and by \"first hand experience\", I mean having heard of Korean cuisine, or maybe knowing someone who knew someone who ever passed a Korean restaurant on their way to McDonald's -- it would be immediately clear that there was nothing particularly Korean about the Spicy Korean Beef.   Also note the word \"Spicy\" in the name of the dish. That may be the only time the word \"spicy\" comes to mind when eating the Spicy Korean Beef at Casey's."}
{"text":"stopped by for lunch - surprised that the by the flavors in the sinapore style noodles i had.......service was excellent, amazing that a chain can do such an impressive job."}
{"text":"Had just arrived and was staying at the adjacent hotel. Really good bar food. And, outstanding service. Perfect for the hungry, newly arrived visitor."}
{"text":"I do not exactly know why Casey's mission in life is to piss off their customers and serve terrible food, always, every time, every location...  With that said, this is so far one of the better locations that I have found. The food is always hit and miss here. Staff always seem to be too busy to serve you and are not very happy and cheerful. Its like you are personally bothering them by coming and expecting to get service while you try too enjoy at best edible meal...   I like the penne pasta, which is a simple pasta dish with peppers, and somehow I ended up without the peppers, its the whole reason I order this dish, the peppers are a nice touch and yet I was being blamed for asking it without the peppers! Even when the manager came, she could have cared less and looked annoyed to have to crawl out of her hiding place..  If you are lucky enough your meal will come out right the first time!"}
{"text":"This location never lets me down.  I decided to try the Bison Burger with Brie, fried apples, onions, lettuce & apple beer BBQ sauce and fresh cut fries.  The fries are certainly better than average.  ....but the Bison Burger was excellent.  Creative toppings to boot on many of their burgers.   Easily the best burger I've had at a chain in Canada.  In Utah.....Squatters Roadhouse makes a mean burger that is truly spectacular for a chain.  I digress......this location consistently has excellent service.  The server was on the ball when it came to refills of my Diet Coke as well.  The only negative is that parking is quite difficult before 6:30 pm.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really? No one else has reviewed this place yet? I was staying at the Hotel attached to Casey's for a few nights and ended up hanging out at this place one night. Call me crazy but I think the bartender was trying to get me drunk. Boy did he make a killer bloody mary. It was almost as good as the bloody marys I use to buy at the \"World's Greatest Bar\" at the top of the World Trade Center.   Having lived in NYC and Austin but never visited Canada until now I would put the pricing up there with NYC.  I enjoyed a thai tenderloin Salad - can you say \"OMG delicious\". Why does this have to be a gazillion miles, customs, passport, and airplane trip away.   Because dinner was so wonderful I went back the next day and tried the Chicken Strips which apparently are hand battered on site, and they definitely taste like it.   oh yeah... and if your mouth and tummy are already wishing you were eating here right now...I didn't even talk about the Bacardi Rum Cake... shhhhhh it's too good to talk about, really. You would hate me if I went into the details of this ever so amazing dessert.   The service of course was phenomenal - whether the bartender was trying to liquor me up or not he was still entertaining and attentive."}
{"text":"I went there with a group of four today, and I must say I was disappointed.   1. Overall atmosphere  They do not take reservations for groups under seven. We were seated right away at a booth, but the booth has very little leg room. The overall lighting is very dark, and the lights dimmed down even more in the middle of the meal for no reason.   2. Appetizer We ordered a Fiesta Nacho to start. First of all, when I think of nacho, I think it contains some sort of ground beef. Nope I was wrong. It contained an insane amount of tomatoes instead. Yes this is our fault for not reading the ingredients list before hand, but was still slightly disappointed on the appetizer. We also asked for extra Salsa/Sour Cream to share, but they cost $0.99 extra each.   3. Entree For entree, two of us ordered steak and two of us ordered burgers.  This is the part that ticked me off the most. This place serves steak, but there's no option of mash potatoes as a side. My steak came cold, and my friend's came barely lukewarm. We were in a rush to go somewhere else, so we didn't really want to complain and just ate our food. According to my friends who ordered burgers, the burgers were decent, but the fries were absolutely TERRIBLE. Soggy and plain. It feels like it just came out of the microwave.   4. Service A lot of upselling. Yes, they do it in every restaurant, but this one is by far, the worst. A lot of items on the menu are suggested, and of course, with extra charge; The menu doesn't really tell you you can substitute sides unless you ask. They were pushing for us to order drinks really badly. The waiter asked us three times if we intend to order any drinks from their (not so) awesome drinks menu. We didn't end up ordering any.  As for the actual service during the meal, our water never got refilled. As well, since we paid  by cash, we expected exact change back. Nope we did not. About $2 was not given back to us, and we were expecting it to be given to us so one of my friend can get some change. We did end up tipping enough, but I personally was not pleased with the service.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Overall, mediocre food with really pushy service. Don't think I will be back again if I have a choice."}
{"text":"Came here to kill time before Avatar 3D with my son. Pricey for portions. Beer was super cold though. Lively bar...loved watching the drunk fall asleep at the bar, nice touch. The manager evicted him so that was amusing too. My son texted pics to his friends. Wouldn't recommend it. Wait staff busy. Not particularly friendly. Two TVs with nothing on, others had sports, which was fine. Maybe if you have a seat inside its better. We were at bar. Been here before. Patio is ok, but noisy. Unimpressed."}
{"text":"#YELPTO #CASEY #GRILLBAR  This is a pretty iconic restaurant on Dundas and Jarvis. And if you're walking down either, you won't miss it. I used to live around here and I tried it then. And now that I've moved back, it called for a second and a third visit!   The reason I went to Casey's twice within the last few days was for their exceptionally tasty Baked Cheese, Spinach and Artichoke Dip. Sure, these chains do a great job at their cheesy dips, but Casey's easily makes it to my top 10. I usually get a half and half order of warm naan bread and tortilla chips with it and it's absolutely exquisite. Great shareable for 2! Must Try!   Margarita rating: 4/5 I ordered myself a traditional Margarita both times I was here. The ones on the menu are fancy, so I made sure I communicated that I wanted the simpler stuff to the servers. And sure enough, the drink was the usual tequila, lime with a salted rim and yummy. The Margarita at Casey's comes in a jar. Sometimes, I am glad when it doesn't come in a fancy cocktail glass, as long as it is presented right. And this was. However, the opening of the jar was too tiny and the garnished lime was in the way. I didn't feel classy doing this, but I had to remove the lime to enjoy the drink.  That was possibly the only bummer in my experience. I would totes come back here!"}
{"text":"Never been to a Caseys, the Service was fast and friendly. The dinner was well prepared and tasty.You get sometime more than you can chew as I needed to take home my left overs. The Atmosphere was perfect to have a evening with a loved one. Will for sure go back"}
{"text":"My second time at this location.  They seem to have climate control problem.  First time I was here the air conditioning was not working on a hot summer day.   This time in winter we had to keep our coats on because they were having heating issues.  Wait it does not stop there. ... Casey s is a chain that has not bad food and the menu and portions r usually consistent regardless of which location you visit,  but this one really skimps on portion size and they over cooked the chicken and undercooked everything else.  Our waiter Paul did notice my date's disappointment with the chicken he got the cook to prepare another without us directly saying we were unhappy.  That was what made this review 3 and not a 1. Oh, the other waiter in the other section had a customer who ordered same dish and also had a problem with portion size. The waiters at this place is the only redeeming quality"}
{"text":"I came here only because of a promotion they had on Wagjag ($25 for $12). I came in here, was seated very promptly. The service was great at the beginning. I ordered 1/2 Rotisserie Chicken with Beef Poutine and a Fruit Lemonade. The chicken was OK (a bit dry & hard), the beef poutine was also OK (7/10), and the Fruit Lemonade was great but the portion was too small (Way too much ice). As soon as I asked for the bill, things started going downhill. I was not allowed to use the WagJag because I was a party of 1, and apparently in the fine print it says there must be a party of 2. My choices were to pay the full $25, or to buy another food item. An hour of my time was wasted solving this dispute. So I was forced to purchase an Apple Mary, which was pretty disgusting (Though the quality of the ice cream on top was good). In conclusion, I spent about about double extra than I intended to. The prices are exorbitant, but the service was OK and the staff were courteous to me the ought the entire process. Would not come back here again, would not recommend either. 2 stars only because of service."}
{"text":"The nice thing about Casey's is the fact that they have a separate gluten free menu and a dedicated gluten free fryer.   Unfortunately that's about where it ends. The food is expensive. I'm talking $7.99 for sweet potato fries, very pricey steaks, pasta, you name it. I don't mind paying more for good food, but this is your typical bar and grill type dishes, and a bill for two shouldn't total $70 at the end of the night with no drinks and subpar food.   I ordered the gfree pad thai on one occasion - It was fairly flavourless, but I chalked it up to a bar and grill not knowing how to make good asian food. We tried again and I ordered a steak. I ordered it medium rare, but it came rare so I had to send it back for some more time on the grill. The sides (veggies, which I usually love) tasted kind of funky and the salad that I requested oil and vinegar for ... Well, I was given canola oil and white vinegar. I'm not saying I was looking for truffle oil or anything, but some balsamic and olive oil should be a staple in any restaurant, no?   It's safe to say that despite the gfree menu (which is almost always a win for me!), we will not be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Casey's in a really long time, but this visit might change that... I had a really nice dinner, and a great time!  Food: They just launched a new menu yesterday when I went. I decided to try a new menu item, Fried Chicken with mashed sweet potatoes, seasonal veggies and a homestyle corn/onion bread. Everything was delicious! The mashed sweet potatoes were something I'd never had before and they were quite nice. It was a great portion and reasonably priced too. Others at my table had the Bison burger which looked incredible, was massive and I was told was very tasty as well. The Jambalaya was nicely spicy/hot and was a great portioned size as well. I didn't have any dessert, but they had dessert nachos, cinnamon donut holes, cheesecake, and the $4 mini-desserts which are a fantastic way to have a little sweetness without busting your pants (or wallet).   Service was awesome as well - our waitress was attentive and friendly, offered add-on suggestions but wasn't pushy about anything.   I would definitely return, the only bummer about this location is no more AMC for movies after dinner!"}
{"text":"We took my mom here for a Mother's Day lunch. It was nice that the place wasn't overly busy. Our service was relatively quick but got slower & slower as more people trickled in. The food was served after about a 20-25 minute wait & tasted good.  But afterwards we were left to sit idle for quite a while before the waitress came by to see if we wanted refills on anything or dessert. We ended up sharing the Pecan Pie which was delicious. All in all, an okay experience, but nothing stellar."}
{"text":"Was wandering around downtown Toronto trying to find somewhere to eat. Went in here, and we were seated fairly quickly. Our waitress was very attentive, and brought us our drinks and food quickly. She had suggestions of what drinks and food she thought was good and she was spot on. I got the bison burger that had apple pieces, apple bbq sauce, and Brie. The burger was delectable, I would easily order it again. I left here full and satisfied. I would easily come back here for just a nice sit down place to get good food."}
{"text":"The only reason I went to this Casey because I got this $15 coupon  in my mail box. Even after reading the negative reviews from our fellow yelpers, I decided to give it a try.  I went there on a Saturday early evening at 6:30 pm after shopping at Scarborough Town Centre. I felt so welcome when I told the host I need a table for one...\"For 1!!??\" \"Yes, for 1.\" \"There will be a wait.\" hmm the place is not too busy..and I saw empty tables. Luckily there was a booth at the bar area opened up, and I got to sit there.  At least with yelper's advices I stayed away from all those fancy Asian Fusion items. I ordered Mahi Mahi with Mango Salsa/rice and a Berry Binge Smoothies. The portion was quite small for the entrees but it was perfect for me. The fish was quite tasty..not great.. but is ok.   The restaurant did get really busy with a long wait around 7 pm. The management start passing around free finger food for the waiting customers which I think that is really nice gesture.  The services was ok, my waiter was a little busy because there were a group of 15 seating right behind us.  I don't know if I will be willing to come to eat at Casey again without any discount or coupon..."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad.We had the fish & chips and a bacon and cheese burger. Each dish could have easily fed two people. The burger was decent. It was pretty big but taste could've been better. The fish and chips were great.  Service is quick although the waitresses all seem new for some reason. The food does take a bit too long to come out though."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend before going to the movie theatre and my experience was good.    Our waitress was friendly and made suggestions for our appetizers and drinks,  and they were  good choices.  We started off with the fried shrimp app with lemon grass dipping sauce, and we had a fancy lemonade.    The lemonade had (if I am not mistaken-there was a lot in it) pear juice,  lychee, strawberry mix,  and seasonal fruit.  It was reallllly reallllly good but the only problem was our glass was small and filled with ice. Two sips in I was practically done the drink and had to save the rest.  I was kinda mad and sad about that,  since it was 4.50$. (by the time I finished my meal I went to drink the remaining two sips (4 sips all together lol)  all that ice had watered down my drink   For my meal,  I got the fish and chips (the regular order not the double)  and it was... okay.  The fish were  kinda small (reminded me of fish sticks for some reason) but it wasn't oily,  and there was just enough batter surrounding the fish. (meaning there wasn't an abundance of extra oily batter, which I liked). The coleslaw was a vinaigrette base,  and it was okay.  It was really simple, like just the slaw and the vinaigrette, no wow or omg factor.    My friend liked her meal,  I believe she got the Memphis Burger.    Overall,  the service was friendly and the atmosphere was great.  My food could have been better.    If I were out with people and we all wanted to eat,  would Casey's come to mind? No,  it wouldn't.  Would I recommend Casey's? Probably not.    But I will probably eat here again sometime soon,  so I'm hoping for a better food experience."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner date. As we entered the hostess graciously opened the doors for us. We asked for a seat on the bar side however no tables were available there so we settled for the much more empty dining room.  We were seated in a big comfy booth. Very simple and classic decor with shades of terra cotta and brown and wooden tables and chairs, very causal feel vibe.   Our waitress soon arrived and showed us the menus and went over the specials. She asked to take our drink orders but I hadn't opened the drink menu yet so I asked for a few more minutes. Deep into conversation I neglected to read the drink list yet and our waitress arrived, my date ordered a beer while I now started reviewing the drinks, they have a good assortment of cocktails, I told the waitress I needed more time as she waited for me decide. Finally when she came back I knew exactly what I wanted:  Sex in the City Cosmo - Smirnoff vodka and Sour Puss raspberry liqueur shaken with an all-natural raspberry purée and a splash of cranberry juice.Served with a strawberry rock candy rim. This was super delicious yummy, you couldn't even tell there was alcohol in it (which I liked) it was fruity and sweet, I could of easily knocked back 4 more of these but the aftermath would have been dangerous. I also loved the rock candy rim!  After perusing the dinner menu for some time we were ready to place our orders. I got the:  Mango Mahi Mahi - Pan-seared and served with zesty mango and lime salsa, sautéed fresh vegetables and rice pilaf. I've never had fruit with my fish before but I really enjoyed this combination, very refreshing, the fish cooked perfectly included 2 nice size fillets, and I enjoyed the simple rice pilaf.  My date got the :  Bacon Cheese Burger - Aged Cheddar cheese, grilled bacon, dill pickle, lettuce, tomato and red onion with a side of Sweet Potato Fries I was lucky enough to snag a few bites of this! Super moist meat, nice toasted fresh bun, classic combo of toppings with great flavour. Overall a pretty up there burger! I liked how they served the sweet potato fries in a mini fryer basket, fries were pretty good too.  After about 20-30 minutes of waiting for our waitress to clear up the table and bring on the dessert menu we had to call her over. We enjoyed that she gave us time to talk but in a pretty empty restaurant we would have expected prompter service.  I ordered a pot of tea and for dessert I knew what I wanted the moment I saw it on the menu:  Peanut Butter Brownie Sundae - Fudgy peanut butter brownie chunks layered in chocolate peanutbutter ice cream, drizzled with hot fudge and topped off with whipped cream.  Even though this was suppose to a mini dessert it was bigger than I expected but I would never dare to share it! It was really delicious and a perfect ending for a pb/choco lover like myself!  Service maybe hit or miss but overall a really great meal with a solid menu, great cocktail options and desserts!"}
