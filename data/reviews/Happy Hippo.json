{"text":"Great service & super yummy food!! Breaded zucchini sticks are a must on a cheat day."}
{"text":"Brought a large group here for lunch, and we were greeted with friendly service.  Most had sandwiches which were generously sized.  Homemade kettle chips filled the plates and were crisp and delicious.  The pork chop dinner, also generously portioned, included two thick loin chops perfectly grilled, along with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.  Good value for large portions; nice atmosphere. There are also salad and wrap options for healthy eating."}
{"text":"Two words..  wow and WOW!  Try the godfather!!

Make sure you call before you go.  Sometimes they're open on Monday. Sometimes they're not.  Sometimes they close early.  Sometimes they don't.

Afterwards- Cheap drinks & a great atmosphere right next door at Manzo's Sports & Spirits"}
