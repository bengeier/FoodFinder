{"text":"The bacon verdi burger is so amazing its my new addiction. If you try this place i definitely recommend the burgers and pasta. Order through the store its faster. If i could give more stars i would. Love this place."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place through postmates and it was absolutely terrible. My husband got the chicken and waffles and they have the audacity to use eggos like frozen eggo waffles?!? The chicken was basically just tenders so it was eggos and tenders. I got the spaghetti w meatballs. Well it wasn't from a box frozen but it was really bland. Even after using a few dried herbs and seasonings it still tastes bland. Not worth the money at all! Will not be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza from here for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised. Great price extremely friendly staff I'll be coming back frequently"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through DoorDash and it was delivered in a very reasonable time!! Ordered the cafe Verdi  special 18\", with no tomatoes as well as a philly cheese steak with mushrooms. 
We've driven past this place and noticed it's inside of a bar so that may be a little confusing to find. But definitely worth the try!!"}
