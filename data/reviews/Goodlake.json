{"text":"I have been to this bistro many times. Always good food with friendly, attentive service. I highly recommend the mussels which are fantastic. The chicken wings are not my favourite but everything else I have tried has been very good."}
{"text":"A friend told me to go there. Had the Confit Chicken Wings and Tenderloin. Both were delicious! Staff was friendly and set up some Halloween festivities for the younger diners. Would go back and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"A terrific restaurant with an amazing staff; great local food; and wonderful wine recommendations.  Steak and frites are always a hit with me"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and I am happy to have such a restaurant in the neighborhood. It was very busy, and it kept getting busier. I suggest making a reservation if you are coming with a big group. The ambience is really nice, suitable for a date. The place is a little small and thus makes it noisy with the number of people they had the night. Loved the service, the servers were quite friendly and attentive and the service was quick, which kind of made up for the commotion. I ordered a spinach salad, which really tasted nice. For mains, I had the tofu as that is the only choice available for vegetarians at the moment. Seriously that tofu was nothing like I have tried before, cooked to perfection in an amazing sauce and those pears were just great to complement the whole dish. The server also informed that the new menu, that is coming in a couple of weeks from now has more items for the vegetarians. I would definitely go back and check what they come up with. Would surely recommend this place to everyone. Oh yes and the one thing I forgot, is the chocolate mousse with fresh cream - just a perfect way to end your dinner."}
{"text":"We have been here several time for perch and other amazing things.  We have not had a bad meal yet! It is also kid friendly which is fantastic."}
{"text":"I attended the restaurant the first night they opened to the public and was very impressed. My boyfriend and I had the mussels and romaine salad to start. The salad was nice and light but packed with flavour and the mussels were too die for. I'm not a huge mussels fan and I could not stop eating them...the broth was delicious. For mains we had the lake perch and shortribs, both were extremely tasty...lick the plate good. The meat fell right off the bone on the shortribs and they were so tender and flavourful. The lake perch was on a bed of parsley infused quinoa risotto and was like nothing I tried before. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! I was here for lunch a few days ago and was so impressed with the delicious food and great service. The restaurant was busy but the server was very attentive and made sure we had everything we could need. I had a delicious croque monsieur with a side salad. The strawberry rhubarb vinaigrette on the salad was tart and refreshing. Tip: save room for dessert, we split a few around the table and they were mouth watering."}
{"text":"I came back to Goodlake last night for supper and it was once again really really good. I'm so happy to have a restaurant like this in my neighbourhood. I had the tilapia with braised lentils and artichoke and really enjoyed it. The portion sizes are just right and the quality of the food is spot on. Prices may be a little higher but it's completely worth it."}
{"text":"I chose Goodlake to catch up with a girlfriend from Hamilton over good food and wine last night and it was a great decision! Both of us lived in downtown Toronto until recently (I live in Etobicoke now) and crave this kind of place: intimate and stylish with thoughtful, seasonal, well-made, wholesome food. What a gem out here in Etobicoke! 

We both started with mussels which were delightful (mussels are kind of a pass/fail thing and they passed). The bread for the table and whipped butter were also delish. The $37 bottle of Pinot Grigio went down smoothly and I will have to remember for next time that Goodlake has $10 corkage every day they're open (except Tuesday when it's $1!). 

My duck confit main was succulent and held it's own (ie. it did NOT lean on a thick, sweet sauce as a crutch - I hate that). My friend's veal chop was so good that she picked up the bone to finish it. Both of us cleaned our plates completely. I was too full for dessert, but my friend ordered the chocolate mousse which she loved. It's worth mentioning that my friend also lives with celiac disease and so we appreciated the many gluten free options and the knowledgeable staff. Both of our mains were recommended by our server. 

There are only a couple things I can think of that could use improvement, and they aren't worth docking a star. It was a bit chilly in the restaurant, so dress in layers. The bottle of white wine we got was placed on the table instead of being chilled - we never got around to asking about it, but I will try to remember next time.

As a final note, the prices here are very fair. After tax and tip, I paid about $75. In downtown, this meal would easily be $100. Thanks Goodlake for giving me one more reason to hang around and love my new neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now. Every plate that came out was incredible. Great service and cozy atmosphere. All around great experience."}
{"text":"Went to Goodlake last night for a friends birthday. Had been previously a couple of years ago for dinner and brunch. Have to say dinner last night was a huge improvement over my first experience!! I had a short rib starter which was so good everyone in the group sampled it. My main was venison tenderloin which was fantastic, perfectly cooked medium rare! Service was some of the best I've experienced in a while, the servers were very attentive while remaining rather anonymous. Glasses were constantly topped up and yet you never seemed to notice them doing it. Everyone in my group lives in the neighbourhood and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch over the weekend. Food was pretty good but the fact that we got in at 11:30, ordered the first time the server came around, and didn't get our food until just after 12:30 overshadowed the experience. 

When I asked the server, she just rudely told me that it was because there were so many people. In my dining experience, the restaurant should be staffed accordingly, which I guess it wasn't. And even if it was unexpectedly busy, I'd at least expect the staff to be somewhat apologetic, which they weren't whatsoever. Or they could have let us know that they were unusually busy and that it may take longer than usual. 

I had the birdies in a basket and my husband had the grilled cheese. The grilled cheese was really good but my husband literally got like 7-8 potato wedges, which wasn't consistent with others in the restaurant. 

That being said, I go to a restaurant for the food AND the service, and they were severely lacking on the latter. It's too bad, because I probably won't go back again because of it."}
{"text":"Food is unreal, everything is top notch! Its a great place for a night out with great service, amazing food and great drinks. I recommend the eggplant apprtizer and quinoa risotto@"}
{"text":"So we gave this place another go a week ago or so, and were very glad to see that the portion situation size has improved. Don't expect huge portions, but you won't be left hungry anymore :)

Service is still amazing and highly professional, and food is still delicious.

And they now have a ramp, so strollers are welcome :)

PS I wish they had an espresso machine there. While they have a lovely way of serving coffee in a cool carafe, a fine dining experience at their prices just isn't complete without a nice cappuccino."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant like Goodlake in this neighbourhood. It was certainly needed! 

I came with my boyfriend on a Saturday night. The ambience was cozy. Dark wood and dim lights. We arrived early but by 7 pm the place was filling up. The server was polite and efficient. The menu was small and there weren't any specials which was surprising as places of this nature tend to have something extra. 

We had: 
Chicken wings appetizer  - very tasty and tender. We had them grilled. They came with a delicious apple cabbage slaw. 5/5

Spinach salad with a strawberry dressing, red onion and swiss cheese- tasty. Nothing special. I didn't really understand the chunks of swiss cheese, but it worked pretty well. 3.5/5

Shortribs - good but disappointing. The meat was extremely tender, cooked to perfection. But I felt it was a bit under seasoned. There were some dollops of a tasty sauce on the plate. I wish the ribs had come smothered in this sauce. 3/5

sweet potato spaetzle - very tasty. I found it a bit bland but the ingrediants were all well cooked and tasted nice together. My boyfriend loved this dish. 4/5


The portions were a perfect size to eat enough without getting overly full. We didn't have desert. 

All in all I give this 3.5 out of 5 but am rounding up because I'm so happy to have a restaurant like this in the area. If you live close by, check out Goodlake. 

I suggest making a reservation!"}
{"text":"Reusing mason jars is cool, reusing French fries is not! The fries for our steak came in two colours, fresh fried ones and another darker colour. The darker one after looking at it carefully, the very salty taste of the fries, and the crumple look of the darker fries we concluded it was deep fried already before. Maybe leftovers from previous diner? 

The way too salty taste of the fries spread to the steak as well. It was barely edible, which was a shame because it was a perfect medium rare.

We also order the 1 lb chicken wings because according to other reviews say it was fall off the bone goodness. We got it grilled because it was healthier. This too was also disappointing. These were the most tasteless wings I have ever put in my mouth. My girlfriend had to take it home and put some soya sauce on it. Yes very Asian.

The overall ambiance was nice with the reclaim wood wall and the glass doors. The waitress was new and was friendly. She was confused when I replied that the steak and fries were too salty. But if I just wanted nice ambiance and good service I would have went to the museum!

Food 0.5/5
Service 4.0/5
Ambiance 4.1/5
Value 0.5/5

{"text":"Goodlake was a great experience!! I went with my girls for brunch on a Sunday and food was great!  So then we wanted to try the dinner menu and had a surprise bday celebration for our friend and dinner was amazing!  Service was great and would recommend anyone to go.  A nice cute little restaurant with very trendy decor."}
{"text":"TL;DR Food: Decent brunch, kind of underwhelming. Service: Good. Decor: Very nice.

It's hard to rate a restaurant based on their brunch so I feel like I'll have to visit again for dinner.

My feelings on this place are mixed. There were some very positive elements and some rather underwhelming ones. 

To start, the coffee is brewed fresh and served in these nice little carafes poured into assorted mugs at the table by the server. It was delicious. Service in general was courteous and informative. I had the Birdie in a Basket (gutted baked potatoes with eggs, asiago cheese, lardon and grape tomatoes served with salad). I found the potato to be a little thick on the edges, but perfectly scooped out in the middle, in proportion with the filling. The cheese was rather hard to detect. The lardon were delicious though. I could have gone for a bowl of those. The salad was composed of arugula, dried apricots and raisins which was kind of nice but was severely under-dressed. I am definitely a fan of not drowning a salad in dressing but this was a little stingy. Another guest had ordered the smoked salmon benny which I had to try. The Hollandaise was seriously lacking. Let's be honest: when one orders a benny, the fixings are basically a vehicle for the Hollandaise. The small amount of sauce crowning the eggs made for very nice presentation but certainly hurt the overall flavour of the dish. My daughter also left some sausage which happened to be rather delicious... not your average breakfast sausage. The other guests seemed to be content but not overly impressed. 

It must be said the the presentation was very tasteful, the decor rather pleasant and the overall experience was certainly positive. I'll have to come back to give Goodlake another chance."}
{"text":"High points: great atmosphere and service. Local craft beer on tap and great wine selection. Daily specials are plentifully and appetizers are fantastic - we tried every one. Low points: the wings are ridiculously small and the food is over priced ($30 for steak frites). Overall, a decent restaurant for the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Went on a recent Saturday night with reservations for 6. The restaurant was recommended to us. Service was attentive. We brought our own wine. Corkage fee of $25 is a little more than I would like to pay but worth it since I brought some special wine. The featured salad was spinach and arugula with bacon, artichokes and cheese (forgot what kind). It was a little bland. The chowder was very good. Our table ordered 3 different mains. The featured fish was Chilean sea bass and it was excellent. The scallop and shrimp puttanesca was very tasty. The beef cheek risotto was good. The beef was very tender and flavourful. The risotto had a good consistency with a bit of a chew. The pieces of sun-dried tomato were too large so it's taste was overpowering. Didn't have dessert but the coffee was good. Will definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I live in Bloor West but have been hearing buzz about this \"hotspot\" down in Mimico/New Toronto. We had heard that this is the place to go. 

A few girlfriends and I headed out in the freezing cold to this warm spot that had an inviting vibe right when you walk in. Cool decor that is a fresh mix of French country, vintage chic and ultra modern. Friendly, knowledgeable staff that gives just the right amount of attention without being overbearing.  The coolest part I felt was their choice of tunes - I heard a little Motown (Stevie Wonder!), 80s and 90s easy listening hits - they know their Thursday night crowd. 

Their special that night was lobster tail, which three of my girlfriends ordered (and enjoyed very much) and just to be different, I ordered the Beef Cheeks risotto. We all enjoyed our meals and didn't have room for their dessert because their servings were such a healthy size.

Looks like we'll just have to go back to try their in-house made desserts. 

Cool spot in an up-and-coming cool part of town. I'd go back."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a brunch spot within walking distance of your home. My second time trying their food and the hubby and I weren't disappointed! We split eggs benny with prosciutto and potatoes and eggs benny with kale and crisps. Husband got freshly grounded coffee which tasted delicious. We took our four-month-old with success. Wait staff were attentive and quick. Really can't wait to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday with my boyfriend. Goodlake is located on a seedy part o Lakeshore Blvd W. Not the best location in my opinion but the restaurant itself is nicely decorated with a warm ambience; lots of black accents and chalkboards with the specials. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived. We were greeted and seated right away. I ordered and a coffee with the Goodlake breakfast while my boyfriend had the smoked salmon eggs Benny. Both dishes were okay, but nothing really to rave home about. My coffee came in its own jug (?), which was neat however the coffee was burnt. I may consider coming back here for dinner. All in all, the experience was decent. If you want to do brunch on a weekend morning and don't mind the location, this may be a good spot to catch up with friends over a meal given my experience of no wait times and quick service, good ambience."}
{"text":"We came for brunch on Sunday morning. First impressions- impressive decor and menu - not bad for vegetarians. We ordered the French toast and grilled cheese special with artichokes. Both were yummy. Coffee via carafe was tasty. We weren't impressed with the lack of fresh juice as well as tea and latte/cappuccino options. The orange juice I ordered went back as it tasted very sour.  For that reason it receives a 4."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go here for over a year now, and finally last week I made it in, and am so glad I did!

The restaurant itself has a nice cozy warm atmosphere. The menu is what id describe as bistro style with plenty of French influence. One of the nicest things though is they offer BYOW (bring your own wine) for just $10 corkage (only $1 on Tuesday I believe). I ordered the Mussels Provençal ($11) to start which had some great flavour. They also brought us some bread which came with house churned butter that had been accented with honey... DELICIOUS! My wife had the Baked Eggplant ($11) which she enjoyed also.

For the mains she ordered the duck confit ($26) and I opted for the bone-in veal chop ($28). She let me try some of hers also which was fantastic, especially the bread pudding, but I think the veal was my favourite by a slight edge. The Parmesan risotto cake and brandy cream peppercorn sauce... WOW!

Service was also impeccable. Not once were our glasses empty with constant attention to the wine and water.

I will definitely be returning and highly recommend making a visit. One of the gems in South Etobicoke."}
{"text":"The food is always wonderful at Goodlake.  I had the veal chop and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  My wife had the lamb shank and loved every mouthful. Tuesdays they have $1. corkage, which is hard to beat and really helps with the bill on a mid week night out!  Corkage is $10. any other night, which is still good considering most of their wines are $40-50.  The price is a little high, but the food quality and taste make it worth while for a special night out.  If the prices were just a little lower and some lower cost choices in wine it would quickly become a regular hang out of ours!!"}
{"text":"Such good food here! The honey butter is to die for if you're ever there make sure to get some, the waitress was so lovely she even gave us the recipe for the butter! How nice is that! 

Food was awesome though it is fairly pricey probs about $20/30 per head so it's kind of a special night out kind of place to go."}
{"text":"We returned a week ago and I am happy to report Goodlake turned it up another notch for all five in our party. 
My highlight was the vegetarian (I am far from a vegan) mains centred around four perfectly cooked rectangular boxes of tofu. The accompanying vegetables were prepared just right as well. Absolutely every bite was savoured:)"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Goodlake last night, and it was amazing. It's great to be able to find quality restaurants like this in the area. Service was friendly and prompt, and the menu items were delicious. The price is very good as well, especially considering the portions. We had a bill of $130 for 2 beers, a bottle of wine, one appetizer, two entrees and a dessert. Not bad at all! The salmon and lamb were both absolutely mouth-watering. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"We were there Sat Nov 14 2015. Excellent service by all especially Shelby, our waitress.
For what we ordered we were pleased. Steak frites was very good but next time we would order it without the wine sauce reduction. Trout special was superb...wish I could replicate at home.
Noise level was a bit loud and it was not full....not sure how one can dampen the noise other than ceiling treatment perhaps?? 
We will be back to try brunch."}
{"text":"Food was good. The servers were all pleasant and frequently checked in on our table. But food took a long time to get to the table. About 40 minutes wait in between appetizer and main meal. The atmosphere was nice. The food was good but for $100 for two before tip was expensive for the quality of the meal. There are a lot of choices downtown, sauga and Markham for the same price with higher quality of food. But our area is limited in good restaurants so I dont mind it. The seafood risotto was probably our favorite."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service!  The chef came out and shook our hands and was really sweet!   I had the delicious muscles and rhubarb bourbon cocktail.  I usually don't so bourbon, but the in house rhubarb syrup is awesome!  Although the prices for mains are currently $18+, you are paying for high quality ingredients and labour to prepare the food to this high calibre.  The vibe is relaxed and the decor is fantastic.  Loved the reclaimed wood lacquered tables.    Wish it was in my neighbourhood!"}
