{"text":"Italian home cooking at its best!  This cozy little establishment is nestled in the Hillcrest Shopping center. 

Upon entering the restaurant, a cute little cafe area welcomes you boasting homemade Italian cookies and candies on display at the counter.

Beyond the cafe area is dining area with a great fountain in the center of the room.  Loved the fountain!  

BYOB, friendly and attentive staff.

We ordered yummy bruschettas to start.  Following that I had a bowl of wedding soup which was delicious.  I really should have stopped with the soup.  It was alot of food already.    

For my entree, I had shrimp scampi and requested angel hair for my pasta.  I wasn't able to finish the large portions and brought home a little bit of everything.

My husband ordered stuffed eggplant, and I have to say that it was one of the best items on the menu, as it was stuffed with cheese and spinach.    

No room for dessert!"}
{"text":"The stuffed shells here are amazing.  They give such huge portions that you'll have enough for 2 meals.  My husband had the bruschetta chicken and he also really enjoyed his meal.  The half portions are the normal size for a dinner portion, so get that unless you're really hungry!"}
{"text":"Great local establishment. Great Zucchini stripes as an appetizer.  Staff very friendly, i try to eat here once a month at least. I support local businesses in rhe Lower Burrell area."}
{"text":"We have often thought about trying this little eatery, but we finally took the chance tonight.  It is small, on a cold night it is drafty, but the atmosphere is quaint and comfortable.  My grilled cheese was delicious, and my husband's wings in garlic butter sauce were good, but the plate was filled with butter garlic sauce, soaking his celery and his french fries. My son's hot sausage hoagie was also delicious, until he found a hair in it.  Because we had waited over a half-hour for the food to arrive, my son did not want us to have them re-make his hoagie, so he ate some of his fries and the appetizer of provolone wheels.  The service was slow, but attentive, and I feel certain that if we had complained about his hoagie, it would have been replaced.  Overall, it is a cute little restaurant with good food, but we left with some irritaion over the slow service, some concern about cleanliness after the hair discovery, and frustration that they serve Pepsi products, rather than the Coke products that all of the sites like yelp and urban spoon had listed for them."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience here.  The staff is so nice and know what they are serving if you have any questions about a meal or ingredients! The cuisine is mostly Italian.  And they do it right! Their soups and salads are very good and homemade fresh! An excellent place for a girls lunch or family dinner!"}
{"text":"I live in Lower Burrell and Elena's has turned out to be a favorite spot for a quick dinner. Salads are great and the service is quick. All of the items that I have had from their menu have been good.  

Usually no waiting for a table and you can park for free outside the door."}
{"text":"The food is good sometimes but the customer service sucks it was the worst experience I have ever had any where. My family was going here to celebrate our Christmas a day early because my Dad wouldn't be with us to celebrate Christmas Eve or Christmas Day my Dad likes going here for the chicken Marsala only he doesn't like the other food so that's why we choose to eat here. The hostess had an attitude from the door dark long hair pony tail that's her she didn't have any Christmas spirit at all and had an attitude from the door. We asked to speak to the owner because we made a reservation along with the rest of my family and they decided that they would separate us 6 from my other family members like on the other side of the restaurant we asked to speak to the owner she came out and we asked if we could be moved closer to our other family members she said no someone reserved that table mind you it has the same amount of seats we had and she stated that they made a reservation 3 weeks ago , well we made our reservation 5 weeks prior to the dinner and she didn't know what to say to that she did not even try to accommodate at all she didn't even try and say hey let me see what we can do she could of cared less about my family, a family owned establishment that's questionable that she even knows the meaning of family from my observation. My advice if you have a large party don't go here they will not try and accommodate you at all they would of had more than 22 people served here on this night but they could of cared less about my family bring business in there door just as long as there business when on an usually. None of my family members will ever eat here again but that won't matter to the Owner of this establishment because she has other people who spend money there those were words out of her mouth. Maybe they need to reevaluate there family owned establishment and the meaning of family."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian cuisine!  I have never been disappointed in a meal there.  You could make a meal from the Italian bread and olive oil and garlic dip they serve with your meal."}
{"text":"Good little spot!  Kind of out of the way and in a plaza.  Had lunch there and played it safe and got a salad, and they did a nice job.  You can tell this is a popular spot for the locals because we got there at 11:30 on a weekday and the regulars were already there hanging out!  Service and wait staff were good and the wait for our lunch was fine considering that we were in a large party of about 15 people.  The bread came out with good dipping oil.  Very good!

I had a grilled chicken salad and there was a nice sized chicken breast on the salad that was more chicken than you would normally get so it was good.  I had them sub the fries for feta cheese and they gave me a nice generous pile of feta and that finished it off nice.  

All the servings at my table looked pretty darn generous for a lunch menu, and we had lots of \"to go\" boxes piled up when it was time to go.  

I'm not in this area often, but I would definitely come back.  well done!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Elena's for years. Never disappointed, specials that are out standing. I recently had their special - Tortellini Tuscany - A delicious and colorful garlic dish. Accompanied by your choice of salad or one of three types of soup, and Italian bread with dipping oil! More please!
Sandwiches for a lighter fare and a gamut of other dishes for all tastes! Save room for dessert because they bring around a platter of decadent sweets that are sure to please! Sometimes I go just for dessert and coffee!
And they have BYOB also. It's located in a shopping center with ample safe parking."}
{"text":"Always delicious! Best wedding soup around! Good service, friendly ambiance. No alcohol, but happily let you bring your own wine. Decent prices also!"}
{"text":"In the mood for good Italian food..  so happy I had the pleasure of dining here.    The atmosphere really adds something extra special to your meal. Your not at a bright - noisy restaurant... its nice and relaxing.    I ordered the banana peppers and side garden/tossed salad.   The salad was a smallest side salad I have ever had but was good.    The banana peppers seemed to be one of the highlights on the menu ..  stated on the menu \"served with Elena's special seasoning..  I just had to order!   It arrived in a bowl and so was fresh just broke apart and was delicious with every bite.  The small sliced Italian bread and the garlic dipping sauce was good too.   I am excited to return and try out other menu items.  Bravo .. good visit"}
{"text":"I order from Elena's at least once every 2 weeks sometimes once a week and I ALWAYS get s Reuben Sandwich with a side of french fries and have never had an issues. Today when my husband picked up my order it only had 8 small fries in it and I thought it had to be a mistake because I have always recieved a decent amount of fries. When I called the girl was shocked that I only recieved 8 fries and put me on hold for a second. I expected them to apologize and offer for my husband to come back for the rest of the fries I paid for but instead I was met with a truly apologetic girl who said that her boss said \"well what does she expect for a side of fries. tell her i guess we can take a dollar off her next order\". I was truly shocked by this response especially since I order so often. I cannot believe that the manger or owner (I am not sure which since the girl said boss) was so rude and uncaring. I will gladly be giving my business to The Around Back and suggest everyone else does the same!"}
{"text":"This place only gets 1 star. My girlfriend and I ordered dinner here a few nights ago and she wanted \"Homeade\" Gnocchi and I wanted the Alfredo that the waitress said was also homeade. Well that was a HUGE lie. When the waitress walked pass us after taking another tables order I again asked if it was REALLY homade pasta...and she finally told us NO! She said they come from a company called GFS.  Anyway it tasted like factory made flash frozen pasta and was not good at all!  We won't go back and will NOT recommend this place to anyone!  Save a trip and go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"The wedding soup was very good. Oil and garlic dipping sauce for Italian bread, not the best bread but pretty good. Baked cod and veal Parmesan both very good with great portions and pricing."}
{"text":"The decor is a bit strange and dated and the sad little strip mall is practically empty; the food however is another story, and the service is friendly.  I especially enjoy the sauces used on the pastas.  Not bad for Lower Burrell."}
{"text":"Tried this place again. Pasta fagioli full of beans not overloaded with pasta. A little chicken meat thrown in and a light slightly sweet tomato base.Wedding soup only one meatball in a large bowl but flavor good. Bread is not what I would expect given all the wonderful Italian bread bakeries in the area. Perhaps a day or two old. Food decent , service good. Get some real bread."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food. I find myself ordering lasagna every time because it's the best I ever had! Fried zucchini is executed perfectly as well. Nice panko crust but not overdone inside. The sauces are excellent and have a deep flavor as though they have been simmering all day. The salad bowls come out chilled which is nice. Also, the bread with Parmesan garlic dipping oil is killer! Very difficult to leave hungry between the bread and hearty Italian dishes! And even if you order a salad, it is very large, loaded, and delicious. My mom has ordered a steak here before, and it came out with a gorgeous sear and she said it had the \"grill\" taste you look for on a nice grilled steak. Never had a bad experience here between the food and the service. The fountain in the middle of the dining room is nice! Great restaurant."}
{"text":"We love this place.  It's close by and the food doesn't disappoint.  I guess we are \"regulars\" for dinner.  The staff is always so accommodating and friendly.  We even had my son's graduation dinner here years ago. You can bring your own wine if you wish."}
{"text":"This small local Italian restaurant has a strong following. On Friday or Saturday night, don't be surprised if there is a wait. 

I always order the steak and cheese hoagie. The steak is seasoned well and the peppers and onions complete the sandwich. Today I tried the sweet potato fries and they were topped with cinnamon and sugar with a dipping sauce. 

The restaurant is reasonably priced and it's great to support a local business."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants! We eat here a few times a month and we are never disappointed. The house balsamic is very good! I recommend the salads, chicken parm, lasagna, chicken bruschetta, wedding soup and any of the sandwiches. They have a smaller menu but they also have daily specials. It is in the Hillcrest Shopping Center and doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is a nice little restaurant with unique decor. It is a good place to have a relaxing meal in a quiet atmosphere. They don't serve alcohol but you can bring your own wine."}
{"text":"If you like Olive Garden, you'll like this place. 

The Italian cuisine is delicious. The bread is very fresh and the garlic butter dip is very tasty. The wedding soup is quite good and filling. The portion sizes are very large but I liked that the menu had a section specifying \"for smaller meals\" in case you're not that hungry. The appetizers were great. We got the platter to try a little bit of everything from the appetizer list. The atmosphere is very cute. A little fountain, some Christmas lights, a dim lit environment. It's a relaxing feeling."}
{"text":"I'm from LA , visiting hometown , this is the first time here w/ my sister. I had the wedding soup, it was very good, the shrimp scampi was cooked perfect, I also ordered a side of sausage w/ meat sauce, spicey and very good. The portions are large and the prices are decent. The waitress was very nice, and on the ball. I wish I had a place like this by my house, I would B there a lot. I wish I knew that it was B Y O B, I would have brought a bottle of wine, every other table had brought their own. Very enjoyable:)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a family dinner at Elena's.  Consistently good Italian food.  The hot Italian sausage is excellent.  Menu has less variety than some but the quality more than makes up for it.  Good choice."}
{"text":"Love the food, the owners are as genuine as it gets and service to good!  Only knock is really not the place itself...hard to make this place a destination - L Burrell needs to draw in some other attractions!"}
