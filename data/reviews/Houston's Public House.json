{"text":"This is a sports bar- so yes there are many t.vs. But the food is pretty good and the service is good. Only complaint is food can be slow, but if your in a big group-you always get all the food at the same time."}
{"text":"Houston's is a fine place to go and watch a game.  There are plenty of TVs to view no matter where you sit.  The food is average pub grub. I've never had anything bad in the dozen or so times I've been here, but none of the items really stand out.

There are daily specials but they don't seem to be in the menu anymore so you have to ask the waitress.  I normally end up there on Tuesdays when there is a steak sandwich special for  around $9 and Big Rock 16 oz pints for $4.

I've always had good service - as soon as I'm down to a quarter of a pint they're there ask if I want another."}
{"text":"This is a very neighbourhood kind of place. Lots of regulars, mixed crowd. Good place to grab a drink with a friend.

Service was very friendly but not super attentive. Food was kind of \"meh\". I had sliders and while flavorful, the bits were really hard. They have an okay selection of beer, wine and spirits - no complaints there.

This is the kind of place you can go super casual and just relax. Lots of TVs if you are the sporty type. And decent sizes patios it looks like too. It won't change your life but you might have a good time"}
{"text":"Someone call Robert Irvine.   Quickly.

I don't know what the design was aiming at, but they missed.  If it was a Southwest theme they need to spin again.  It was dark and dirty.  Perhaps my mistake was dropping in when the sun was still out.  That accentuates the scary.   

There is a solid layer of dust on the speakers that hang on the ceiling above the tables.   Cleaning is easy but they have skipped it for some time.

The food?  I had the \"baked pasta bolognese\".   The title was so misleading that the dish could run in next week's election.   What was brought out was a dish of overcooked macaroni in some type of grim tomatoish \"sauce\" accompanied with hamburger meat that did not appear at all excited to be part of this dish. The entire dish was covered in melted mystery cheese.  

No one can credibly claim this as pasta or bolognese.  It appeared to have spent time in an oven so I will concede that it was baked.  Never order it and think twice about even going to Houston's."}
{"text":"Local neighbourhood bar with a fine selection of beverages and foods.  Service is always prompt and efficient providing standard fare which is good enough to keep coming back too. Overalls pleasant experience"}
{"text":"My GF drives past Houston's everyday so she thought we should give it a try. We weren't disappointed. Great food, good service and the mangaer, Gil is awesome. Very accomodating person. We've been back numerous times in the last few months with just the 2 of us as well as several groups of us. 
We've had the wings pretty much every time we go. They're a good size and great flavor. The pizza is great and the mac & cheese is fantastic. I've also heard the burgers are good and the calzones are great as well. 
Definitely a place worth checking out. We will be back many more times to come.
Thanks Gil & staff!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place because I know what to order. I always come here on Thursdays for Corona and wings special. I've never seen the place more than 1/2 full. Be very picky about what you order though. Wings and pizza are really good, but alot of other items do not taste fresh. I don't think they are busy enough. The inside is clean and cozy feeling, with lots of TV's. The dress code is jean shorts for the waitresses which is weird because there is no other country vibe at all inside.

It's a good place for beer, wings, pizza and a less busy environment, but it's not anything special."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just have to start over. Well, sort of. This place used to be a Beckham's. I have fond memories of Beckham's on 32nd.. it was the first place I ever had wings. It was the first place I ever developed a serious crush on a waitress, the kind of doomed, ill-fated crushes that can never work out - because she's your waitress.

And as an aside, that's the whole problem. Waitresses are usually hired because they're attractive. This means they know they're attractive. This also means they get hit on constantly by drunk, smarmy dudes, old men and perverted chongos who high five each other before launching into a deep conversation about how much they curled at the gym earlier that day while wearing a backwards ball cap and a shirt with a collar. They're also paid to be nice to you. Bar owners thrive on the fact that they can find beautiful serpent women who can trick you into thinking they like you.

Because of this, you shouldn't bother taking a swing at asking out a waitress. At least, not if you meet her when she's working. It's like the golden rule; never ask out an on-duty waitress. Ever. It's not going to go well for you. No matter how much you admire her straight teeth and her cheery voice when she says, \"White or brown?\" when you order a clubhouse, it's probably not going to happen.

Of course, nothing's impossible. Moving on.

The Beckham's franchise has been battered back and forth after unsuccessful launches of a downtown location and then this one on Centre Street. So, you really can't blame them for rebranding. It still looks the same inside as it did when it was called Beckham's. In fact, the stylized \"B's\" are still hanging out above the bar at the time of this writing.

There are a lot of televisions. A LOT. If you can't watch the game you came to see here, you're probably blind. It's not a big place, but they've made the most of the space and as far as pub decor goes, it feels pretty upbeat and modern.

One thing that has ALWAYS bothered me about this place is that aside from their wing nights, their specials are garbage. $4.00 for a bottle of Pilsner? Oh, be still my beating heart. I ordered one because I'm cheap and thirsty, but COME ON.

Anyways, the experience was an improvement over Beckham's if only because of our waitress. She was personable, friendly and explained that they were, in fact, owned by the same people as when it was a Beckham's but are no longer affiliated - without looking at me like I was some sort of idiot. She brought our unremarkable drinks on time and with a smile - but you can never trust those smiles.

Our beers were cold. The place was relatively busy considering it was a Tuesday. Both good things.

In the end, this is a pretty average neighborhood pub. The food ranges from great to meh and they're really not doing anything spectacular to warrant a higher rating. I'll be back with higher expectations on a night that I'm really hungry - I hope that this Beckhouston's can deliver."}
{"text":"The place was mediocre. Poor service, run down looking on the inside. The food was dried up and old tasting. The cups for our drinks were sticky and servers were just bummed out overall. They made comments about how they always had seating... I wonder why. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special to look at but the service was friendly and the wild rose velvet fog was cold and really that's all you need !!"}
{"text":"Ok...Because I live close I come here...sunny deck..ok priced beers. As usual they are OUT of my first choice...what kind of budget or management runs this place????

I understand that the dress code for the waitresses is demin shorts..summer..winter..snow storm...anytime..but the one waitress's shorts were so short you could see above her butt cheek fold and the front well..camel toe comes to mind. I'm not a prude but seriosuly???? Have a little class and maybe you will do better..seems you are on the verge of shut down and soft porn costumes on those girls , is not going to save you!

I hope owner or management actually checks out the comments on here.

Shame Shame"}
