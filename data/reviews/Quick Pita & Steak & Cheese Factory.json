{"text":"i always like this place, yes it was empty sometimes.the parking in that area is a mess and that is the main reason people don't stop. I ordered delivery and it was great. great food, we need more quick pitas in toronto"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. It's close to where I live (stalker alert!). Not many places serve a Philly steak & cheese (an American delicacy I got hooked on in Seattle) in Toronto. But. Hmph. Quick Pita is your basic Lebanese shawarma place. That a Philly is on the menu intrigued me. I hoofed it up there on a cold Saturday night. Service was quite friendly. The food came quick and hot. Prices are quite good. They serve a spicy french fry as a side. It's that coated fry that was \"popular\" at Harvey's several years ago which they wisely discontinued. Quick Pita makes it actually work. The Philly itself is meat + cheese + a bun. It wasn't quite the onion and pepper loaded mouth bomb you might get in a more traditional Philly joint.  Meh. Nothing really wrong but then nothing really bringing me back."}
{"text":"After almost a year of driving by this place and wondering if I should try it or not, I somehow managed too..  Quick Pita isn't anything special at all, that's for sure, and I'm not crazy for middle eastern places but it was the Philly that brought me in, so I gave it a try..  Service was quite friendly, and the place always has no customers. I really do not know how they are still surviving..  Prices are quite good, but being surrounded by other middle eastern restaurants they lack in the customer department.   I got the the Philly on a whole wheat pita, (which comes has two sandwiches). It seems to be better on whole wheat pita then regular.  However everytime I have tried (which was only a couple) it seems to upset my stomach, so I am not sure if it just isn't for me or if they are using bad meat..  Its nothing special, but it isn't bad either. I just wont be rushing back anytime soon."}
