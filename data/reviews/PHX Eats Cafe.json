{"text":"There food here is delicious and always fresh. I have also ordered take out for delivery and had prompt service. Marissa is always professional and courteous and greets everyone with a smile, as well as the rest of the folks who work there."}
{"text":"I hate to complain but the first time I ordered from here, the food was so good. Ordered the Teriyaki Burger and it was amazing! Worth the $1.50 up charge because it had the lettuce, tomato, and onion. Today was disappointing because it was just bread, a broken burger, 4 pieces of pineapples, cheese, and teriyaki sauce all wrapped up in brown paper (spent $10.75 for the meal and $1 for delivery). Called to confirm that burgers come with lettuce tomato and onion. She states yes they do and offered to give me a side of it. I am NOT waiting for sides that SHOULD be on the burger. There was no offer to make a new burger and expects me to wait so I can enjoy my cold burger that is no longer appealing. Thanks for the motivation to bring my own lunch."}
{"text":"I LOVE Phx Eats Cafe.  We order delivery to our office every day and sometimes twice a day.  I'm from NY so the microwaved eggs trend in Phoenix disgusts me but this place actually uses a grill and cooks their eggs right.  Their breakfast burritos and egg sandwiches are the best around.  

Eats lite sandwich + Bacon is amazing.

Socal Panini is amazing.  

Chicken ranch wrap....wait for it.... amazing."}
{"text":"I had food from Phx Eats delivered through Foodsby (an awesome service!). I had the Cobb salad and it was amazing. I substituted edamame for the bacon. The salad is a great size, bigger than I expected. The chicken had great flavor and the rest of the ingredients were incredibly fresh. What a difference that makes! The bleu cheese crumbles were delicious and more flavor than what I typically find. It came with a red wine vinaigrette, but I didn't even use it much. It wasn't needed. I will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch menu!! Friendly staff and freshly prepared food with a diverse menu selection. I had the turkey avocado sandwich on a croissant and the bread was nice and fresh. I highly recommend the mini-cakes for dessert."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and owner. Clean shop. Consistently good food at good prices. What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Came in today and ordered food as I was waiting in the area it was very disturbing to hear the manager yelling and really saying things to a young cook in the back which were very wrong.  Not the first time I have been in with this kind of yelling.  The food you guys put out is amazing - and if the young man in the back is the one putting it out He is a keeper.  I give him 5 starts."}
{"text":"One word: YES!! I've finally found an amazing food place that delivers to my work! Underline & emphasize, 'delivers to my work' because it's a bigger deal than you even know! After having continued issues with the only other non pizza place that will come to me, discovering this gem has been a life saver! I ordered for the first time today, the Three Cheese Pizza & a side of their House Chips. With tip it was only $10. I've paid way more for way less. & this was anything but less. The pizza was huge! I ended up giving half away. It was also super delicious! I've never had a pizza with so much melted cheese & sauce! They did not skimp! The chips were everything they should be & the perfect afternoon snack for this pregnant lady. Another perk, they have an extensive menu for both breakfast & lunch! I'm actually looking forward to work next week just so I can try something else! Don't ever change, PHX Eats Cafe!"}
{"text":"I could not resist sharing how wonderful I think this place was. We recently started using foodsby here at work and today me and my co worker ordered the Southwest chopped salad, the Cobb salad and a cup of Chicken poblano soup. Not only did they arrive early with our food, the salads are huge! I was shocked at how great they looked. The salad was green and crisp and everything in the salad was good portions. They had our order correct to the T! I asked for extra dressing and they gave me plenty...we even got a mint which I though was a cute sentiment, don't ask me why. When I went online to post a review I was surprised to see that they are not close to our office at all because my soup was still hot and everything looked as if it were just made.
My lunch made my day a little brighter so kudos to PHX Eats Caf√©!! I will order every time you are on the foodsby list for delivery!"}
{"text":"Giving a 2 star review based on the fact that there is no consistency with the food here. I usually order breakfast here and get it delivered to my office. The staff does not know how to accommodate order modifications. This morning I ordered the \"eats best breakfast sandwich\" sub cheddar for the American \"cheese\" add avocado and mayo. The sandwich gets delivered with American cheese and avocado spread, essentially guacamole. On top of the sandwich not being correct, the girl who delivered it shorted me on my change. I dont care about the 91 cents but its the principle. I won't be ordering here anymore."}
{"text":"Every time I order, my food is incorrect. I spend at least $10 a day here. One time the pre-made sandwich was labeled wrong and when I told the owner he didn't even apologize. He just said \"yeah they were labeled wrong\" so in short not worth it too me."}
{"text":"Every thing I have ever had here is really very good. I have recommended to a great many people and they have always said they were surprised as to how good all this stuff is coming out of a deli/cafe. Have the Chicken Poblano soup it is killer!
I have had catering in my business from them as well at my home, parties from 5 to 75. Never a disappointment, never late and prices are reasonable. Give Brad and his crew a try you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I only order the eats lite sandwich. Last few times i ordered for pickup there wasn't any feta cheese on them as it usually does. This time i walked in to order asked to make sure there is cheese. The lady even opened my sandwich as she is giving it to me and said its there, \"blended.\" I opened it up when i got to the office and no cheese. Not even a trace.....

I wish they cared... just a little bit."}
{"text":"Great food (breakfast and lunch) & friendly, kind service. If anything is messed up they will take care of you and make it right, no questions asked. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is actually in a business complex and was kinda hard to find. Be aware that around lunch hour the line is incredibly long. I came, saw the line and walked right back out to find another place for lunch. Didn't seem like a place to go If you weren't there exactly at 11:45am"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Small sandwich/coffee/snack shop hidden within in a corporate office building near the airport. Well maintained and clean. Has a positive and busy vibe. Only 7 tables. Patrons mostly those who work in the surrounding corporate offices. This place also does quite a bit lot of take out and delivery for the surrounding corporate offices.

Food: An impressive breakfast and lunch menu. For lunch, all your standard deli options with a variety of meats, bread and cheese options. I definitely wouldn't call this place a artisan sandwich shop but their options are a cut above the standard deli. Also with a solid salad menu. Portions sizes were excellent for price. 

Service: Served promptly even at the lunch rush.

Overall: A great breakfast and lunch option for those that happen to be in the area already or catering a business lunch."}
{"text":"I used to order here almost every day.  The food - breakfast and lunch were good and they were quick.  That has changed drastically for some reason.  The first time they upset me is when they charged me at the time of delivery for a side of ranch.  I had to literally get $2 before he would give me my food.  Not one time previous had this happened and there is nothing on the online ordering that specifies this, however there is a place to put in special requests.  Then they forget part of my order.  So I decide to give them one more chance.  My order shows up almost 2 hours after I orders, COLD and incomplete.  That will be my last time."}
{"text":"Good food. Even better people. Always friendly and happy to make reasonable accommodations if you ask. They also will fix anything that's not quite right (but they don't know if you don't say something and no place is perfect). I eat here almost every day and love the breakfast specials!"}
{"text":"I used to work in the vicinity of where PHXeats was, and going there was a daily routine. Either I would order and have it delivered, or mosey on down to the building. Either way, I was never disappointed. The food here is fantastic, the fruit is fresh, the baked goods delicious (Especially the lemon bars!) and the service was phenomenal. 

There are weekly specials, both breakfast and lunch, that are not on the regular menu (and believe me, I have tried almost everything on the original menu) and they never disappoint. 

Trust me, if I didn't have to relocate to another part of the state, I would definitely keep coming here. Don't miss this little gem of a place, try them out."}
{"text":"They always screw up orders. Once they left my food downstairs and didn't even tell me. Then I order  a salad and they mess it up. If they don't have something that goes in your food they do what they want to your order. They put guacamole in my salad because they ran out of Avocados. Last time I order. I spoke to Brad last week he was going to give me a refund and never got it.."}
