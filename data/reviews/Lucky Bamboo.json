{"text":"Lucky Bamboo is located right next to Chatime and is extremely close to their competitors such as Ox Noodle and Picko Lime. The competition is tough in the area, hence the restaurant can be pretty empty 8/10 of the times. I don't mind though because I like the quietness and comfort of eating in a restaurant that is not so busy or loud. Plus their food is good.  The service here is pretty mediocre, which is the usual at most pho stores so I am not surprised. They will take your order, serve you your food and that's pretty much the end of their service. Anything else you need later in your meal, you will most likely need to flag them down. But the service isn't what brings me here... it's the food. I been ordering the chicken pad Thai ever since I first discovered this place three years ago and it is pretty much my usual go to dish. It is not really the most authentic pad Thai but I really do like their variation. The chicken is really tender and the thin vermicelli noodles compliments the tangy and sort of spicy dish. It's usually not spicy enough for me so I tell them to cut fresh chillies and cook it in for me. That usually does the trick. If you order it at lunch, you get a spring roll and your choice of soup or pop for 8.99 which is a great deal."}
{"text":"Spoiler: overall very tasty Vietnamese cuisine with fast service.   Atmosphere & Service: typical clean Vietnamese restaurant setup and decor. Service was quick and efficient. Exactly what you'd expect when eating at an Asian style restaurant.   Order & food: we both ordered 2 different house specials. My wife got the vermicelli version with grilled chicken, shrimp on sugar cane, honey sausage & a spring roll . I got the rice version with grilled pork & beef, shrimp &  bean curd, and Vietnamese quiche. Both dishes came with a coleslaw as well. All the grilled meats were well marinated and flavorful (beef was a tad dry tho).  The honey sausage tasted delicious & authentic. The shrimp on sugar cane was tasty as well but very different from what i normally have. The shrimp texture tasted less meatier and consisted of more herbs and spices (remember to chew on the actual cane to release the sweetness while eating the meat). Shrimp and bean curd tasted a little soggy but again yummy.   This brings me to the spring roll, which is typically the dish i use to benchmark a Vietnamese restaurant with.  With all the other foods tasting delicious, i had high expectations when munching on the spring roll. The result was meh. It was crispy, but the filling was very bare. The wrap they used reminded me of the cheapo spring roll wraps you can find at a chinese buffet, too thick! I was actually surprised at how far they fell off the mark on this dish.   If i lived in the area this would definitely be my local Viet restaurant, but i would come back if i was in the area. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the great reviews, we went there on a Friday night and weren't disappointed. I love that they serve up a small lettuce salad with the grill chicken vermicelli dish, and never overstuff with bean sprouts.  Portions are on the smaller side but still quite satisfying.  Will definitely be back for more.  Agreed with one of the reviewer that the spring roll was sub-par. Tasted very much like frozen ones from the supermarket."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese in Vaughan! Always fresh and made right. Relaxing room great staff! The pho I'd my favourite!  Very clean not like most spots."}
{"text":"This is our GoTo place for pho. Best pho I've had since we moved to Woodbridge. We eat here every week, even though there's another pho restaurant closer to our home. Their grilled meat with vermicelli is a favourite. They also have amazing bubble tea. The tapioca is cooked perfectly which is not always the case with a lot of bubble tea shop."}
{"text":"Update: If I could eat at only one restaurant for the rest of my life, it would be Lucky Bamboo"}
{"text":"Based on all the 4 or 5 stars here, I had high expectations. I ordered a pho and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't something that I was amazed by either. It didn't seem like the people at the restaurant were Vietnamese, but that's just my guess. *Edit: Remembered why I wasn't impressed. The broth was pretty good, but the beef was BLACK half the time, and it didn't seem like the usual burnt beef either. I had never seen something like that. Obviously, I avoided those pieces."}
{"text":"Garbage service during Victoria Day had to wait 1.5 hours for fried rice and then 20 mins just to get my bubble tea. The food isn't special in any way, and to wait about 2 hours to get my full order it sucks.  This was my first and last time eating here."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 3 stars if the service was good. The food is not bad but this old lady that works there was not friendly at all. My 3rd visit to this place and had the same bad service from this old lady. Will NEVER come back."}
{"text":"Best pho in Vaughan area. Service it okay.  Parking available. Good appetizers like the pork wonton.  Bubble tea also."}
{"text":"A friend has recommended me this place and I finally had a chance to visit on my way to Vaughan Mills Mall today.  The initial impression is place is clean and modern.  While browsing the menu and looking at other table's order.  I notice their rice dish looks delicious.  However, since I feel like having soup base item today I order bun Bo Hue and spring roll.  While spring roll is crisp, the wrap itself is too thick and lacks fluffy texture of Vietnamese ring roll that I like.  It tastes more like Chinese spring roll coming out of not so authentic Chinese restaurant, what a let down.  Bun Bo Hue itself tastes ok but lacks the kind of spicy kick compares to some of my favourite places.  Also tried their other signature dish, Ma Ma rice (Hainamese chicken rice) which is also recommended by a friend.  I've got to say, their Hainamese chicken rice is probably the best I've had in Canada.  The chicken meat is very tender and dipping sauce elevates the flavour of the chicken.  The rice itself is yummy which complements the chicken.  Although the meat portion tends to be on the lower end comparing with the rice, but quality is definitely there and I'd like to reorder it again in the future.  Also tried pho since my last two visits, the broth is clear and light.  Although not as flavourful as Ossington or College joints, but still better than those at Chinatown area.  Goi cuon uses fresh ingredient, shrimp size tends to be small but the sauce has elevated the flavour.  One thing they consistently do well is freshness of ingredients, which is a big plus but I find more and more Vietnamese joints simply neglect this single detail.  Overall the dining experience is quite pleasant.  The dining area and washroom are clean and service is friendly.  I'll definitely make this my lunch spot whenever I go shopping at Vaughan Mills."}
{"text":"I was working late and was starving. I was craving for some pho and decided to hit this place. Service was good, food came quick and the pho was good! I got the special combine pho. The soup base was yummy, satisfied my appetite. Found a new quick place when I'm starving. Also, will try to come back for the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Good authentic Vietnamese food. Good drinks and moderately priced. It's cheaper than buying in that crowded food court at vaughan mills."}
{"text":"Great price, great quality of food, pretty good customer service.  Went to Lucky Bamboo for some pho after a day at Canada's Wonderland. I found both the quality of the food and the price for it to be very decent.  However, I found that at times when we needed assistance from one of the servers, they seemed to be rather difficult to flag down.  All-in-all, I'd likely return to this restaurant if I feel like Viatnamese, and I am in the area."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favourite Viet restaurants in the area. Very expansive menu and decent prices though some food portions could be a bit bigger. Everything is tasty from the Pho to the rice and vermicelli dishes and even the Thai selection. Highly recommend! They serve bubble tea too!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and disgusting pho!! The menu does not specify if the chicken is grilled, we were expecting high quality grilled chicken much like the place next door (Picko Lime which has WAY BETTER pho). Instead we got bland gross boiled chicken and the pho was tasteless.   The server was distracted and rude; we had to ask for water twice and got it only after our entree was presented. When we asked for a towel to clean the table he interrupted us saying \"just hold on a second\" and then forgot to give us said towel until we had to ask a second time!  Then when we presented our issues to the Manager (who doesn't even smile to welcome you to the restaurant) she instead proceeds to argue with us loudly about the food and how we ordered the chicken wrong.   Bottom line - stay away! For quality food and service go next door to Picko Lime!"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian pho in the GTA.  Chockful of veggies and flavourful broth without much MSG if any. Also accompanied by the hottest chili pepper I've ever had at a pho place."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service ever. The owner (lady) is very rude and argumentative. I ordered the pho but the chicken was boiled not grilled so I asked to change my order and she argues with me that I should've asked if they offer grilled instead of assuming. Then she refused to take a new order and argued until we walked out. Never going here again."}
{"text":"My friend raved about the vegetarian options here. I had the beef pad sew here. It was pretty good. Good price great service, good place for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I went here recently for dinner with my parents.  We loved it here!  I had the Rice House Special (C401) which was $9.99.  It came with grilled beef, grilled pork, bean curd stuffed with shrimp paste, and a piece of Vietnamese quiche, with steamed rice, a small salad and a bowl of broth.  It was so delicious.  The portions are small, but I loved the variety.  The grilled beef is really thin, it tasted like beef jerky.  I love beef jerky so I was a happy camper, but someone expecting a thick juicy piece of meat may be disappointed.  The grilled pork was a little thicker and equally delicious.  The marinade for both meats were sweet and very flavourful.  The shrimp paste wrapped in bean curd was fried and a little oily, but still delicious.  The bean curd was crispy.  The shrimp paste tasted more of flour and fish than shrimp, but I still liked it.  The Vietnamese quiche was excellent, but I could have done without the neon orange colouring on top.  The Vietnamese quiche had the typical ground pork, vermicelli noodles, strips of cloud fungus, with an egg glaze on top.  The egg glaze had an unusual orange hue to it (food colouring, I suspect, although it could be from annatto seeds I guess).  Authentic Vietnamese quiche has real crab in it.  The one here had artificial crab.  However, for $9.99 I expected as much.  Rice was perfectly cooked.  The salad was shredded like a coleslaw with a light vinaigrette dressing.  It was mostly iceberg lettuce with a bit of carrot.  The broth was tasty albeit a bit too salty.  The dish also comes with  a side of fish sauce, but I don't like fish sauce so I told them to hold it.        My dad had the Vermicelli Special (B301) which was also $9.99.  It came with grilled pork, nem nuong (Vietnamese meatballs - although it's shaped more like a log than a ball), chao tom (minced shrimp on a sugar cane), and a spring roll, with vermicelli noodles and the same salad that came with my dish.  My dad also loved his dish, although the portion was too small for him.  The nem nuong were not much thicker than my finger and had an artificial-looking reddish hue to it.  The chao tom also had an artificial-looking hue to it, except orangey instead of red.  He did note that it didn't taste \"shrimpy\" but rather floury.  The spring roll did not have the authentic Vietnamese spring roll wrapper (rice paper) but had the usual Chinese spring roll wrapper.  I didn't taste any of my dad's meal, so all I can comment on is the appearance and what he told me.  My mom had the Special Egg Noodle (H006) which was $8.50.  It was a bowl of egg noodles with shrimp, BBQ pork, fish balls, squid, artificial crab, bean sprouts, fried shallots and one shrimp fritter, and a side of broth.  The shrimp fritter was 1 shrimp in an egg roll like wrapper and then deep fried.  My mom liked it.  She enjoyed her meal overall.  The shrimp were a good size, and there were 2, plus another one in the fritter.  There were 2 slices of BBQ pork.  The pork was lean, not fatty.  There were 3 fish balls (each cut in half), 2 surimi crab sticks (each cut in half) and 2 pieces of squid.    You get a free pot of tea (jasmine green tea) when you first sit down.  Service is nice and friendly.  The restaurant is clean with bamboo plants all around.  The washrooms are relatively clean as well.    There is lots of free parking.  This restaurant is across from Vaughan Mills Mall.  So skip the food court there and head over here to eat!       Despite what I perceive as unusual colouring to some of the food items, I still thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  I would definitely come back if I was in the area.  I love Vaughan Mills mall and pretty much always go there when I'm visiting Toronto, so yeah, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 1 to 2 times a week for over a year. Mostly I eat their Pad Thai. I've had pad thai at other places in Toronto but I really like their's the best."}
{"text":"We were craving Vietnamese food & decided to try Lucky Bamboo. My first impression was that it was a modern and clean looking restaurant. When we arrived, we were greeted promptly & were given a pot of tea. We ordered the Beef Satay & Spring Roll with Vermicelli and their Special Combination House Pho. They both were very tasty! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Even 2 tables of Viet yummy Mummies and their Girl friends in my vision couldn't make this Lunch meal of mine enjoyable and it's unfortunate.  The wall color and paintings along with various items make this atmosphere a bit more exotic then the standard Pho eateries, so as I was served by an Ikea cup of Tea rather than a Tea Pot I began to realize the disappointment.  (-0.5 *Star*)  Lunch Specials($7.50) were more on the Bun Vermicelli and Rice dishes variety while it comes with your choice of Daily Soup or Soda Pop.  It did take awhile before I went to the standard P01 item which is from the regular menu.  What else can P01 be? At a Vietnamese restaurant, the typical FIRST item that regular Canadians will call upon is the 1st Pho item on the Menu.  Special Combination Pho($6.99/Large) was served in a big bowl that I can dip my Face in for a Pho steam facial.  The utensils were given upon ordering your item and I got this tiny ceramic Spoon that looks like more for decoration than for usage.  Initial Broth looks slightly Oily and the various Meats were pretty good most unique was the Brisket Slices were a bit thicker cut.  Noodles were a bit al dente however I did wish that the piece of Paper in there was a $100 BILL.  (-1.0 *Star*)  The Ladies left while I was finishing up but from what I noticed from all tables were that most patrons didn't finish their meals.  The Ladies finished 5% of their Bubble Tea and left it without wanting to take it with them.  Another table left lots of Pho while an older Couple left their Bun Vermicelli Noodles.  Anorexic?  Big Portion? Bad Flavours?  The Pho left a bad taste in my mouth afterwards while I went back to work and didn't have a Beverage in sight.  Weird.  With a growing community of Vietnamese and Viet Restaurants that they bring to Woodbridge/Vaughan, this place needs some work to be in competition.  (-0.5 *Star*)"}
{"text":"I often come here for a satiating lunch special complete with a spicy Tom Yum soup! Very good Viet food with stylish decor and superb customer service. For around $8.00 for the lunch set, I am one happy kid!  It is a smaller restaurant with not too many tables, but quite busy for the Friday lunch period when I was there. For sure I would recommend this place to others. =]"}
{"text":"This is my favourite go-to for a good, filling and delicious meal. It tastes like home cooked. The owners are so friendly and nice, and always provide great service. I always get one of their soups - the pho is really good. A clear and flavorful broth. I tried all of the other noodle soups and would definately get all of them again. The house rice special is also really good. The beef and pork are well seasoned and the steamed egg is one of the best I've had. The fresh rolls with beef is also a favourite and you can't go wrong with the vermicelli either. It comes on a plate, rather than a bowl so it's a bit deconstructed but still delicious."}
{"text":"Not Luck-just skill!  Every time I pass Vaughan Mills, i stop into Chatime.  When it's lunchtime, I also grab a bite at one of the great restaurants in the complex.  My usual quick lunch in a Vietnamese Restaurant?  Pho.  Competition is really stiff since most of the Vietnamese joints do pho very well.  At Lucky Bamboo, there is no luck involved.  As usual, my rare beef pho was a filling meal in a bowl, with great flavour.  For a bit of a kicker I added a spring roll.  It was crispy, tasty, and gone before I knew it.  Lucky Bamboo is on my list of places to repeat when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with one of my coworkers. After looking at the review I expected more from here. The pho broth was so bland and very oily. The portion was also small. My coworker was still hungry when we returned to work."}
{"text":"Good food. Fresh although the tea was a bit tepid. The signature appetizer plate was just OK. The pho was great. The broth was flavorful and the service attentive.   A keeper."}
{"text":"Good selection, good prices... definitely a place to check out next time i'm around and hungry... :)"}
{"text":"What we had: vermicelli house special (Johnny N. posted some nice photos, contains grilled pork, 1 spring roll, 2 sausages, 1 sugarcane shrimp), rice house special (again look at Johnny N's photos, contains grilled beef, grilled pork, shrimp cake, and crab quiche), grilled pork vermicelli, pho, grilled pork roll, and sugarcane shrimp  Taste: 9/10  Everything we've had so far taste solidly good. The specials and the appetizers here are DELICIOUS. Their grilled meats were very savoury. We loved the rolls and all the different things they include in the special dishes. The pho was average, but then again this is not a specialty pho place so don't expect the pho to be extra good.  Value: 7/10  A dish + appetizer (average cost for a diner) is about $15-20 after tax and tip, depending on what you select. The pho portion is not that big and they don't give a lot of meat, and the sugarcane shrimp appetizer is pretty expensive ($7 for 2 skewers, better to just get it as part of the house special).  Service/Convenience: 7/10  This place is in a plaza next to Vaughan Mills mall, and it's not visible from the street. Finding this place is not too bad. Service is pretty efficient, there is one friendly server and the others just do their job.   Would go back? Yes, whenever I am in the area.  Would recommend to friend? Yes, their appetizers and house specials.  Similar places: Most Viet places will also have similar dishes. Pho 88 also serves vermicelli but their portions are smaller, although their pho portions are bigger. Another is Ben Thanh, but we've only had the spring rolls and pho at Ben Thanh and they are more or less comparable to Lucky Bamboo.  **Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza (16\") in one sitting."}
{"text":"Service - 4 stars Food - 2 stars Net rating - 3 stars  Went to this place for some take out and ordered the following: appetizer platter, special rice plate and taro bubble slush.  Service was great as the two guys manning the cash were efficient. Food and drink came out quickly.   Food tastes great and the rice plate packs at lot of flavour.   However, portions are extremely small for what you pay for. If you're used to pho99 (or something similar to it) you will be greatly disappointed by this place.   Uploaded some pics - you be the judge.  Unsure if I'm coming back"}
{"text":"This place is locally owned by a Vietnamese family. They're very welcoming and friendly, the service is on point. My boyfriend and I tried some new dishes instead of resulting to pho like always. Food is very flavourful! The portion is massive for the price it's worth. Would come back for more if it was closer to us."}
{"text":"My Viet restaurant of choice in the Vaughan area. This is a neat little place tucked away in the massive plaza expansion that has gone on in the Vaughan Mills area. Walk in and you'll find the decor to be modern and clean, very atypical for a Vietnamese restaurant. That's right, don't expect to find the tables lined with chopstick boxes, napkin dispensers, and sauce bottles. None of that here.  The menu is pretty typical for a Vietnamese restaurant. Pho, rice dishes, vermicelli, etc. The pho broth is a bit lighter and the bowls are slightly smaller, but for what it's worth, it's slightly better presented (not that this really matters when it comes to pho). The general consensus among everyone I've taken here is that the pho is decent. However, the vermicelli dishes are wonderful. I think where they shine is anything that uses the grill -- so this would include the rice dishes as well.   Interestingly, they also have a decent selection of vegetarian options. The veggie udon soup is easily the best veggie noodle soup I've had (and yes the broth is vegetarian). Substitute the udon out for the pho/rice noodle and you've got a real winner - an awesome substitute for actual pho.   I have had the Bubble tea, don't think it's anything special. Passable. Am not a real fan of their shakes, the consistency is a bit off and I find my usual flavour of choice (soursop) to be done a bit too sweet. The tea that they serve is much better than other Vietnamese restaurants though."}
{"text":"Not the best PHO in vaughan, especially their service. I've ordered delivery about 2-3 times from them since they are literally the only pho restaurant in vaughan that delivers. I've been given different prices each time I've received the bill and it's extremely annoying..  Food is just okay, a little saltier than other pho places and their spring rolls always arrive soggy."}
{"text":"the food here is good. i really like the pho. the noodle dishes and other things are also good but i usually dont go for that. i like it cause its convenient also instead of going all the way to toronto for some good pho. the bubble sherbert bbt is also bomb, so u try that or u can go next door after u eat and get cha time for more authentic bbt. good food, they accept credit cards so thats really good as its diff from most asian places. service is good, you get tea right when u come in, it can get pretty busy around lunch time so the wait may be longer than usual. washrooms are really clean compared to other pho resturants. more of a white pho resturant than asian but authentic."}
{"text":"Viet style food, done with care and perfection.   Tucked away in a small plaza, this place was busy on a Tuesday at 1 PM. There were only two tables empty, a larger one that could sit 6 and a small one (which is the one they gave me).  Lunch specials are $8 for an entree, a small soup, and tea. I asked the guy there (who was waiting, busing tables, and running out on delivery calls) to help me choose between a Pad Thai and a Chicken Vermicelli with a springroll. He told me to go with the latter.   And that was a good choice!  The food was fresh, tasty, and quite filling. The food flew out of the kitchen very fast too.  The soup of the day was hot and sour, served in a tiny bawl. Just enough to keep you busy while they are plating your dish.  BTW I passed a couple of other places on my way there and those were empty. Lucky Bamboo was far from it. I don't know if luck has much to do with it or maybe these guys do such a good job the word does actually get around."}
{"text":"Great place, family owned. Its very clean and neat.  Favourite dishes is Beef Pad Thai and chicken wings. Everything tastes fresh.  I also like the smoothies a lot."}
{"text":"Came here as I was in the area. In case people have problems finding it, Lucky Bamboo is located very close to Chatime and a few other adjacent Vietnamese restaurants. The sign is not that visible due to the font. My friend and I had almost given up going there as we didn't see it while driving by.   Really liked my Grilled Pork & Spring Roll vermicelli dish. Portion was just right. I really liked the pork. It was cooked to perfection. There was a small bit of fat that I had to cut off but no biggie. Very tasty. The spring roll was so crunchy. I loved it ! The noodles were thin (exactly how I like it) and side salad was great too. Would definitely like to come back again.   They also have smoothies and drinks. If you don't want sugar added, let the waitress know."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant,  very close to wonderland, so we came here after a wonderland visit.  The place was clean and the staffs were very friendly.   We ordered green curry, special combination pho and beef tender and pork chop rice.  All three turned out great.  Good portion and nice presentation.  The green curry was quite spicy, got a nice kick.  Had green curry in other Vietnamese rest, this one was most spicy.  Be careful if you order that.  All in all, good food.  Would reco."}
{"text":"First time going here for Vietnamese food and probably the last.    Pho was ok - broth had a little too much fat/oil.   Beef pad sew wasn't anything special.   The biggest disappointment was the shrimp fried rice. I have never seen such a small amount provided as take out.  I mean, the medium size container was only half full for $10.99! Lacked flavour as well...very disappointed"}
{"text":"Good little pho place. My rating stands in the middle because there was nothing spectacular going on. To be honest, the noodle to soup ratio was a little off. But it is good pho overall. Would come back here if other pho places around the area is busy."}
{"text":"I've had the pho here, vermicelli, the rice dishes, and they are delicious. I'll always support a small local Cambodian business and without being biased, all of the meals tasted as close to home made as possible. The service is excellent and everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"Been a patron for several years since it was owned by previous owner. Menu still the same, a few modifications. Salad is very bland slaw now. It really could stand to be kicked up a notch. I will say the food is quite good, prices fare and service is efficient, but somebody should tell them about customer service. The young woman who serves most of the time does not know how to crack a smile."}
{"text":"Lucky Bamboo is located in the same plaza as some of the other Vietnamese and Thai restaurants, between Rutherford Road and Vaughan Mills Mall. The decor is fairly minimal, the interior is casual more than anything. When we sat at our table, we were offered a pot of tea and teacups. One of the first things I noticed were the mini versions of condiment bottles that you normally see at Vietnamese restaurants. They were very cute.  We ordered 3 dishes -- the Vietnamese coconut curry with chicken, the large special combination pho, and the pad see ew with beef. The coconut curry was the first to arrive, and was the best of the three dishes. The curry was tasty and smooth, the chicken was not overcooked. I could eat the curry on its own. The pho was mostly noodles with very little meat. The meatballs were very tiny. The pho broth was very tasty, though. The bowl was also a little smaller than I expected for a large. The last was the pad see ew, which was a fairly small dish for the price. The beef was quite tough and overcooked. The noodles were a little too sweet."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to this restaurant after a long day at Vaughan Mills. Restaurant is located right next to Chatime. We had lunch here in the past and had a better meal then. Today meal was mediocre at best; not sure if they changed chef or owner or what but food didn't taste the same. My husband attempted to order in Vietnamese, bit the staff politely responded that she doesn't speak Vietnamese.  Today we ordered; 1) House special Pho. Broth was just okay but not bad either. I was disappointed that they didn't use the fresh Pho noodles (thick rice noodles would be the authentic one to go with Pho).  2) Pho Bo kho (beef stew noodles). Broth was tasty, however, they used the cheap dry noodles instead of the fresh one.  Overall, portions were adequate, however, it wasn't authentic. Perhaps my expectations were higher as I  Viet. Not sure if I will return"}
{"text":"Was a good meal.  But they don't offer bun (Vietnamese salad/noodle bowl) which I love to have the option if I'm not feeling Pho."}
{"text":"First time coming here won't be the last. Staff very friendly, family run. Had the seafood pho broth was very clean and tasty. My friend had the green curry was very nice portion for the price and freshly made. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I drop by whenever I visit my sister. Been going here since three owners ago but food remains excellent and cheap. Love their special rice dish with beef, pork and shrimp."}
{"text":"had spring rolls, pad sew and green curry. i didnt like the food at all.  food - flavourless, tasteless, boring and very small portions. i wouldnt go again  location/service - convenient location and good service.   not going back ever. they didnt have chilli oil!! like WHAT!!?!?!"}
{"text":"Went here because of the high ratings. I got the beef pad sew and my gf got a large pho, really disappointed. Portions are really small. I'm sure Thai Express' pad sew is double the size of Bamboo's pad sew AND half the price. ridiculous. Meat in pad sew was really chewy like they just took it out of a freezer and boiled it. The sauce was watery and bland. All the meat in the Large pho u can fit in one of their tea cups, there is about a handfull of noodles swimming in a gigantic bowl of soup. Taste-wise both were average to sub-par and does not taste authentic. The lady behind the counter and serving had a bad attitude and looked very annoyed with us even though we were her only customers. I'd recommend Pho Xpress at Bathurst and steeles if you want good food and service"}
