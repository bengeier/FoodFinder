{"text":"Friendly staff. Killer drinks. Cinematic atmosphere."}
{"text":"You can order food from Andrea's at the VDKA bar. VDKA is a very casual walk bar bar with about 10 seats on the casino bar. The black cod from Andreas is absolutely delicious! It is sweet and very light. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Cool, relaxed, good drinks, expensive.

Cool little lobby bar in the Encore with tons of drinks featuring loads of vodkas.  A few beers for the guys offer another choice.  I had a strong stout bottle of craft beer.
A great spot for before/after dinner drink with a date id you don't want loud music.

The bar has a cool ice rail that stays frosted for cooling your drink."}
{"text":"The best night of my life. Incredible drinks. Awesome service. They say that since this is on the casino floor it's not a \"destination bar\". It is my favorite bar in Vegas because the drinks, the atmosphere, the variety, and the knowledge and friendliness of the staff is just perfection. 

Try the Blood Orange Martini, and the Cotton Candy. And the Espresso. They will change your life."}
{"text":"Wow what can I say this hotel the rooms were amazing. The front desk accommodated me to the best of their abilities and gave me a room on a lower floor at my request and put me on the strip side with an amazing view of the Fashion Strip Mall and other nearby hotels.

I know that many hotels have floor to ceiling windows but these were clean and amazed me all together. The robes in the room I considered a bonus. 

I was wowed away by how upscale and beautiful the hotel is and believe if I return to Vegas this will be a top option for a hotel stay."}
{"text":"The widest selection of vodka Martini's, probably in the planet.  It is a bar in the hallway at the Encore outside of Andrea's. It's a bar to get a couple of drinks and continue on.  Only has 10 seats.   Cynthia is a Martini pro! Try the bacon and maple."}
{"text":"This is my personal favorite in Vegas. I love the red floral and butterfly decor with modern flare. A friend told me it looked like a dream I would have. I've only stayed at three here: Bellagio, Aria, and Encore, but the rooms here were truly five star."}
{"text":"Saw this on our way to dinner. Had a cool design and interesting cocktails listed. Wanted to stop in for a cocktail as we were 30 mins early for our reservation. We waited for about 5-10 minutes and then the bartender walked over and said \"I need to see ID\" and then walked away. After another 5 minutes, she checked our IDs and said she would be right with us. We waited another 10 minutes while she chatted with the only other couple at the bar. I got up and left as I didn't want to miss my reservation and the restaurant next door. I honestly had never written a bad review to date but I was annoyed by her lack of professionalism. They lost out on 2 drinks and the chance of another 2 after dinner."}
{"text":"First time coming here and let me tell you!!!! This bar is a must go to spot when in Vegas. It's a small bar in front of Andrea's, on the left side of surrender nightclub.

There's about 10 chairs available, so you're lucky if you get a seat! We ordered some food..they have happy hour! $6 drinks, sushi and some entrees. I ordered the Moscow mule and got a few sushi rolls. All were really good. Our bartender was Armando, he took care of us and even suggested some other drinks for us to try.  I loved the surroundings because it was super chill, but also exciting because of the crowd walking past us. You can even watch sports, and if you ask them, they just might change the channel for you.

All in all, I would definitely come back here. We went on a Saturday night, I would love to see how their crowd is during the weekday."}
{"text":"The encore is a tower next to the Wynn. It's about a 10 minute walk to the main strip. It is expensive but unless you're VIP you are treated as barely tolerable guests. The rooms are nice but the hotel has bare minimal amenities unless you pay extra. For instance, you will see no coffee makers, microwaves or mini fridges in your room. Well there is a mini bar with outrageously expensive drink items. We ordered a separate fridge for an additional cost. Also, they do not offer amenities that are standard to any mediocre hotel (like a motel 6 or a howard Johnson). For instance the gym is restricted and can only be used for an additional cost. Also wifi is only available with an additional fee which is usually complimentary with any hotel 1/3 the price of this one. The cable is also subpar with few channels and a guide that will display the station but not what is playing and since it is an HD TV the pause when you Change the channel takes for ever. We found trying to find something on TV to watch to be a very turbulent process and eventually gave up. The attitude the others in our group and I experienced from the staff was as if we were trespassing on their land and they were barely tolerating. For instance when we check in the line is very long and snakes around. Our rooms were not ready so we go the the pool. There were two young men and no line. However, They told us we had to wait back in that long line at check in and get pool passes. My friend asked if he could just CALL and verify with that giant antique land line phone. He was very hesitant big eventually came clean and admitted that he could, in fact, do that and he did, begrudgingly. I saw many hookers in and around the casino too. And because they are permitted to linger about there are guys lingering around looking for hookers. The problem with THAT and what some don't realize is that pretty young girls that want nothing to do with those exchanges get harassed continuously late at night. Guys \"looking for a good time\" will stand near the walking ways and hiss things like \"hey\" quietly or \"you wanna party\". At first I didn't understand why these strange men would try to greet me like that and when k give them a strange look they look away and wouldn't follow their odd whispered greetings with some sort of explanation but then someone explained that they say these things to girls and if they are prostitutes then the prostitute will approach the guy but normal girls just get creeped out and want to run away especially when you look in their eyes and you see what they want you for. I don't like this hotel and will never return. I will discourage everyone I know to avoid this hotel if possible. To sum it up it is: expensive, not close enough to the main part of the strip, the amenities are minimal-anything else will cost you addition fees, and I felt dirty and creeped out in the casino areas. Highly NOT recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing bar with an amazing selection! If vodka is your drink, then this is the place. Very classy- beautiful location and hotel."}
{"text":"Best property in Vegas! Attention to detail is second-to-none. Elegant and luxurious. Meticulously maintained. Amazing restaurants and top nightclubs. Great boutiques and sparkling pools. 

Tower Suites are worth the upgrade to not have to deal with the main lobby registration. Andrea's has a great vibe and even better food. Country Club Sunday Brunch is best on the strip. 

Highly recommended! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great small (10 seats) bar next to Andrea's restaurant and Surrender nightclub at Encore Las Vegas. Tons o' vodka, great cocktails and you can order anything you like from the full Andrea's menu. SO much fun for people watching if you don't want to go to Surrender but want to watch the craziness as people stand in line..."}
{"text":"Had a great server named Jeremy that provided attentive service and superior knowledge regarding the vodka selecrion. Sampled several but the Beluga Gold was extraordinary as the price point point would suggest.

The cooling pad built in the bar is awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing hotel and terrific staff--and we have stayed on property several times, with the last couple in the Tower Suites.  A nice environment from the moment of check in to check out.  A shout out to the European Pool staff and the setting.  A marvelous place to unwind and enjoy--

Thank you, Mr. Wynn, for your dedicated efforts to deliver incredible experiences everywhere one turns when on your property.  You have made believers out of us for many years now--keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Right outside of Andrea's at the Encore. We were waiting on our table and we said what the hell let's have some martinis. I can assure you they make some nice martinis. Whatever flavor crosses your mind this guys will weep up something and it would be very tasty. We got a nice buzz going before we went in and with the cocktails we had at Andrea's it came to be a perfect night."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas!  Very nice property, connected to the Wynn.  The butterfly motif is everywhere 

The casino is upscale and modern.  Great table games and slot machine selections. They have a great free wifi service in the public areas and offer guests free periodicals via the PressReafer app.

The rooms are all suites with very nice bathrooms and separate living and 
sleeping areas.  With big flat screen LCD TVs in the rooms.

They have great restaurants including my favorite Sinatra's. Spa and pool facilities are world class.

Overall a great experience but they lose a star because they block your cellphone reception in the rooms. So 4 out of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL 

Got to the room quickly smooth check in. Great view and the bed looked so comfortable I had to lay down and test it out before checking the rest of the room out. OH YEAHHHHHHHHHH so comfortable :)

Love the tv stand because you could watch it from the couch or the bed. The light switch on the wall in the room I loved so I had to test that out closed the curtain with turning the light off. Nice bathroom so overall nice room spacious and full body mirrors to use which is a plus in my book. 

Took a nap so this review is the following day after i arrived 7/9/16"}
{"text":"4 stars for the cool and innovative drinks
2 star for the extreme price

came here  a few times, dont love the service, nothing special here, juist a cool place near a club that has pretty cool and interesting vodka drinks

got a vodka espresso, which surprisingly was really good! you can taste the coffee in the drink, itl give you a nice jolt before you go out and party or club!  but it was like 18 bucks or so"}
{"text":"Great place to stay with stunning views in every room.  Pool closes at 8pm which is a shock but may be that is the norms here.  Great offer with buffet voucher.  In room amenities had a significant downgrade from my last stay.  That said, it is still the premier place to stay in Las Vegas to insure best experience."}
