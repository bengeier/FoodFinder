{"text":"A must stop on your way back from Vegas! 

I had the huevos rancheros with their signature green chili and pork. So good! The portion to price ratio was a nice return to normal coming from the land of a $10 beer on the strip 30 minutes away. The eggs were cooked just right and the pork green chili was smothered over the fried tortillas and beans. If you like green chili and solid breakfast food you have to take the very quick detour into the historic downtown area. 

I'm sure there is a wait almost every weekend but that will give you some time to do some antiquing. 

I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Came with a group of 10 guys and they accommodated us really well. The food was delicious and the service was great! All the waitresses were super nice and helped us out so much. Will definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"It's nice. Great club sandwich and good service from pretty hot Chicks."}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way from Las Vegas airport heading to Arizona.   Tried the breakfast recommended by Guy from Diners, Driver Ins  and Dives.  Excellent choice.  Omlet was really really good.  Will definitely be back to try lunch."}
{"text":"The best place for breakfast on the earth. Awesome place. Well worth the wait for a seat. Great food and staff. I had the country fried steak and it was bomb. This place is family owned and operated. Best food ever!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were staying in Las Vegas and someone at Delta Airlines recommended The Coffee pot. Good food neat area and really nice people, also on the way to Hoover dam as well!"}
{"text":"Ate here with friends this past weekend, and was a bit let down...too much hype? The wait was sooooooo long, the food was ok, and the service?? Hope these guys do not lose what they had because of the popularity and attention."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Boulder City is a must try. If you don't believe me, take  Guy Fieri' advice, he featured this place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. He was right on with the Pork Chili Verde Omlette- OMG!! It comes with hashbrowns, & toast and was totally worth the trip!! It's a short trip for some delicious food. We also tried the peanut butter pancakes, which were to die for, but if ordering the side of pancakes know that a short stack of them comes with two. Also highly recommend the country fried steak, the quality of steak was amazing, gravy was out of this world and it was tasted by someone who has had their fair share of country fried steak. He said and I quote \"probably the best I have ever had\". The cinammon roll was also absolutly delicious, it came out warm and had an icing drizzle on top. The only downside was we got stuck in a corner table and we had two tall guys with us, so it was somewhat of a tight squeeze for our whole party. But overall this was an incrediable dining experience and I highly recommend this for a nice weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"5 stars for the verde pork omelet and the peanutbutter waffles alone! Those two items have taken us out to Boulder City multiple times. It's always super busy, but worth a short wait."}
{"text":"One of the 3 best diners in town. You really cant go wrong at any of them and we try and rotated between the 3 when we go out for our weekend breakfast.

It was featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives, what more can I say!!!

Good enough for Guy, good enough for us!!"}
{"text":"The club sandwich and the huevos rancheros are incredible. Long wait on weekends but worth it every time. Mimosas are great as well. Was on Triple D for their pork chile verde!"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place except, you need to eat here. We had the chicken fried steak and huevos rancheros. Both were excellent choices, but the service and atmosphere put this place over the top. if you are headed to Hoover dam or there for any other reason, stop in. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've lived in BC for 8 years now and loved the Coffee Cup from the beginning.  The food is really good, the prices MUCH more reasonable than Milo's, and I like the retro atmosphere.  Even spent an hour there once talking to famous drummer Sandy Nelson, a local who eats there regularly.  My only problem with the Cup is that they CLOSE AT 2PM EVERY DAY!  Good Lord!  If they'd stay open until 10pm, they could hire a whole evening crew, putting another 4 to 7 people to work while bumping up their profits considerably, and the place would be FILLED every night!  As it is, I rarely wake up by 2pm, so I get to the Cup about once a year.  Nice for the owners who seem happy with what they have, but not so great with the population of BC and the many folks who travel through town each day.  Pity."}
{"text":"We can only judge this on what we had on our one visit, but boy were we impressed.  If you're looking for a basic breakfast/lunch joint with homestyle food, this is the hit!  Fun, friendly atmosphere.  Lots of happy friendly folks. Most of all, it's got good food made with good ingredients.  Nothing fancy-schmancy, but just plain good.  Fun, kitschy decor.

We had a hard time deciding whether to give it 5 stars or 4 stars.  It is, after all, just a breakfast/lunch place.  We'll go with 5 'cause they are great folks, but keep in mind this is just a casual breakfast/lunch joint.

Before we ate our breakfast/lunch, we had a couple of Bloody Marys at the teeny 4-seat bar.  I wasn't even going to have a drink, but once I took a sip of my wife's bloody mary I had to order one.   Best bloody marys ever!  Lots of spice and horseradish, but perfectly balanced.  A little on the strong side (I had the owner/bartender dial the booze back a bit for me), but for most folks that's a bonus not a drawback.  Best of all, every bloody mary comes garnished with a big, thick slice of delicious, high-quality, pepper bacon.  

I had the huevos rancheros and The Mrs. had a bacon cheeseburger (with more of that yummy thick bacon). 

The pork chili verde in the huevos rancheros was wonderful.  Real long-simmered homemade chili verde with pieces of pork that fell apart!  It was just an itty bit on the salty side, but still delicious.  My dish was garnished on top with a fresh salsa-type mix of tomatoes, purple onions, and cilantro.  My two pet peeves are undercooked beans and undercooked hashbrowns; both were properly cooked here. 

The wife ordered a cheeseburger with more of that awesome, thick, pepper-bacon.  She likes her burgers rare, but it only works if the meat is good quality.  Otherwise a rare burger can be kind of gross.  I didn't try her burger, but she said it was good quality meat and cooked exactly the way she liked it.  It's not often she gets a burger she's happy with.   She was happy!  I could see the burger juice dripping down the side of the bun as she bit into it.  She likes her burger with a soft bun grilled on the bottom (burger side).  That's exactly what she got.  She did say she wished they'd had an option for cheddar instead of the Kraft-American-type cheese-food slices, but for a good diner burger, American slices are just fine.  

All the service staff were just great.  Very friendly gals, and responsive when we needed them.  The owner-dude, who was manning the bar, is a cool biker guy who makes everyone feel comfortable.  Noise level was good too -- It had the normal busy sounds of busy breakfast/lunch place, but no loud music constantly blasting your brain..  We were able to have a nice conversation with the table next to us without having to yell.  

The Coffee Cup is a a great place;  I think it's about to become our regular weekend breakfast joint!

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  The servers are quick and very friendly. I went there about ten times in 3 months and had 5 stars service every time.  If in Bolder City this place is a must."}
{"text":"Stopped by after seeing the review by The Food Network. 
Delicious. ! 
Quaint, friendly personnel. 
Americana in real time. Will swing by any time we're in town."}
{"text":"The food is amazing if you're hungover but if you're not I'd refrain unless you enjoy sucking down grease or you're looking for indigestion followed by heart attack!! The service is always pretty good although after a night of drinking I'm not expecting much except to get my food on the table fast and keep the coffee coming which they've always managed to do.  Either their food has gone downhill or grease no longer cures hangovers like
It did in my 20's, either way it's not the worst place you could stop to eat but it could be if you forget your antacids!"}
{"text":"The Coffee Cup is always our first stop when going to go ride Bootleg Canyon.  We arrive there early and very hungry.  I always get the breakfast burritos as I can eat half during breakfast and save the other half for lunch.  

The ambiance is great as it has a nice hometown family feel.  One day I need to venture out and try their more famous dishes.  However, I have had luck with the breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place in the whole western US, we make a point of stopping for breakfast when we drive from Las Vegas to Phoenix.  They have the best green chili, I like to have it smothered on my eggs and hash browns.  There is usually a wait, but it goes fast.  The coffee is also wonderful, I take a bag of it home with me."}
{"text":"A must try ! Food is so yummy .. Very friendly staff and quick service even during lunch time . Loved it and will definitely be making the drive back soon."}
{"text":"This food was amazing I had the smothered burrito and my husband had huevos rancheros. We ate early in the morning and didn't eat again until after 9 o'clock at night. It was absolutely amazing the staff were awesome and everything we asked for was done exactly the way we wanted it. Yes there was a little bit of a wait and by little bit I mean less than 10 minutes. And this was on Wednesday. The price was reasonable the food was outstanding and the atmosphere was wonderful."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Menu is extensive and portions sufficiently adequate. It's nice to see they cater to the adventurous eater like myself and the healthy eater like my mom. Try the green chile pork omelette--it's the best!"}
{"text":"Warm friendly inviting atmosphere. Excellent food. I know why everyone in the Las Vegas valley knows about this place. Best breakfast around."}
{"text":"Good food serviced quickly and great atmosphere.  I enjoyed the ambience and the price was right."}
{"text":"The coffee cup is a good place, but they are usually packed with people. They have delicious food and drinks. If you get the cinnamon roll, they are huge! I go for breakfast. The waffles, are great, they are soft and easy to cut. The french toast is also big, they give you a lot of powdered sugar. You get a side of sausage, bacon, eggs, toast and other sides. The walls are covered in licence plates, sports stuff and a poster of a Solider that lived in Boulder City, he is mentioned in the movie called, The Lone Survivor. It is a restaurant worth eating breakfast at."}
{"text":"Great stop at Boulder city for breakfast.  You might have to wait to get seated but not more than 15 mins.  Good service, food came out fast.   Breakfast potatoes are the way to go or you can have pancakes or French toast instead for an additional .50.   Good luck making a selection on the menu.  If you're like me, get a buddy & order different things to share.  Take a look around, there's fun stuff on the wall.    The Cup of joe is pretty good.  When you leave, take s peek at the antique store next door."}
{"text":"Neat place to take an out of town visitor - plus very good food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Great little place with nice atmosphere in a small downtown area. Was able to go for a nice stroll through town after eating. It is a popular place as there was a short live when arrived and still a line when we left. You have options of sitting at a table or at the counter. Food was very good. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious ribeye steak sandwich and the best onion rings ever...the sandwich is big so they split it for us. Great friendly service too.b"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had hands down. The huevos rancheros and pork Chile Verde will change Ya life! Awesome staff, very friendly. There is usually a 30 minute wait to get in but it's well worth the wait.  If you haven't been, get there!"}
{"text":"Extremely cute place in the awesome little town of historic Boulder just 25 minutes outside of vegas. After gambling in casinos all week Boulder City is a great place to escape to. Had one of their famous bloody Mary's, so good with the perfect amount of spice. Parents had the Dakota burger and could not stop raving about it, as well with a cup of the pork chili verde (what their famous for) said it was the best thing ever. I had a breakfast burrito without any meat and it was just simple but still delicious. Will definitely go back here again next time I need a little escape."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed  this place. Had the pork chili Verde omelette (soooo good!!) The people were great friendly and service was quick. They have regulars specifically Art older gentleman who teases the waitresses. Our server Ashley was fun. loved this place wish I could give it more stars."}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly staff, really laid-back atmosphere.  Exactly what you want on a trip to or from the Dam and/or the Lake Mead hiking trails.  This is a really great place to go."}
{"text":"We live in Henderson and decided to take the short 15 minute drive to Boulder City to check this place out.  It has appeared on Diners Drive In's and Dives and it did not disappoint.  It has now become one of our weekend go to breakfast spots.  I tried the Chile Verde omelet and it was very good.  My wife got the chicken fried steak and eggs and said it was the best she has ever had.  They also serve coffee from a local coffee roaster.  It was also so good that my wife had to buy a bag of it to take home.  The only downside is that the place is rather small, so it can be somewhat of a wait on the weekends. It may be small but that also adds to the small town cafe feeling that is very rare to find anymore.  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is interesting, in a great way.  
The porky chile verde is to die for."}
{"text":"awesome Green Chile Pork Omlette!
Food Network didn't lie!
cute little place service was good, not great
over all good experience!"}
{"text":"We were just at the Coffee Cup and it was oh so worth the drive from Vegas.  I had the infamous Pork Chili Verde Omlette with a short stack.  It was so good, I ate the whole thing!!!

We loved the atmosphere, the people and staff were so friendly.  There was a 25 minute wait, but 2 seats opened at the counter and that's where we had this delicious breakfast!!  

As we took pictures of old surfboards (my husband a surfer); old skate boards; we were invited by Big Al to see another skate board with the metal wheels; my husband use to have one as a kid!!  What a complete pleasure this place is!!!

If you are anywhere near Vegas, it sure beats a buffet anytime; it doesn't get much better than this!!"}
{"text":"Longer wait time than I would like but definitely worth it. Staff was tonight very pleasant and nice.  Has a coffeeshope feel but the food was delicious BIG portions Amazing bloody marys.  The Huevos Rancheros were also amazing and my twins split the short on cash which was perfect for 3.5 year olds."}
{"text":"What a fun place to grab breakfast with our friends! We waited about 10 minutes and then were served endless cups of coffee during our meal. 

We got the Cali omelette and the 1-2-3 (1 biscuit & gravy, 2 eggs & 3 pieces of bacon). We enjoyed all of it! The atmosphere was great and enjoyable. The food was great - good bang for you buck!"}
{"text":"Amazing little hole in the wall.  Had pancakes but with a twist, they actually put peanut butter and bacon in the mix... It was sooo yummy. Staff is great, very nice and polite. Very inexpensive but amazing food.  A must visit on your way to see the damn."}
{"text":"This is a must stop on the way to Hoover Dam.  Since you'll want to get to the dam early to beat the heat and the crowds you'll need to stop for breakfast, so...  I had the pork chilli verde omlette-superb.  Child A had the biscuits and gravy which she declared to be awesome.  Child B went old school with pancakes-kinda hard to be too different there.  Wife had some veggie-girly dish that she claimed was \"off the hook.\"  We were there shortly after 7 AM on a Friday and were seated right away, but it was filling up pretty good when we left an hour later.  Service was well above par-I never had to face an empty coffee mug.  Prices were fair.  if I lived nearby I'd go broke-and get fatter-eating here every day.  Almost worth another 2000 mile plane ride.  Almost...."}
{"text":"Very nice place.We stopped there for breakfast on the way to the west rim!! 
The menu offers lot of choices , the portions were large and everything tastes good. Must stop by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Not too bad i had the hangover breakfast it was good service was fast had to wait 20 minutes for a table and parking is at a premium that said they have good bacon"}
{"text":"Had to wait to get in but the wait was worth it. The breakfast was great, bacon thick but crisp, eggs done to perfection and the biscuits and gravy was good for a restaurant. Would not give their cinnamon roll high recommendations, but ok. Flavor was good but reminded me of a packaged roll. Their sausage is excellent."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Best place to grab breakfast in Boulder by far! The only thing I would say and it's not really the restaurant fault is the wait time. Depending on how many people are in line you can wait 15min to 30 min depending of course on how busy it is."}
{"text":"Great service! Awesome food! Every time! Definitely worth the wait! And their pork chile verde is delicious, and this coming from a Mexican!"}
{"text":"Cinnamon Rolls!! Good food, good service, great location!"}
{"text":"Finally went for breakfast. Split Downtown Omelet and Pork Chili Verde Omelette with my sis. Downtown was very good except too much bacon. I never thought I would say that. About 8 pieces. The Pork Chili verde was off the hook as Guy Fieri would say. Awesome! Pork was tender and the verde gravy was perfect. Thank God I only live half an hour from there. The corned beef  was crispy on the outside and great on the inside. My son had the peanut butter waffle and he loved it. He knows peanut butter! I still highly suggest this great restaurant."}
{"text":"I love driving to Boulder City to eat at the Coffee Cup. The employees are so friendly and attentive. We always order the papas with chile verde (hash browns with pork green chili). It has always been really good but today it wasn't that great as most of the meat in the chili was just pieces of fat. This will probably not keep us away as we love the great service we get from their employees."}
{"text":"Mein Vater, mein Bruder und ich haben hier auf unserem Weg zum Skywalk unseren Frühstücks-Stop eingelegt.
Sehr nette Bedienung und flotter Service. Die Karte ist ausgiebig mit vielen Frühstücksvarianten zum selbst zusammenstellen ausgestattet.
Ich hatte ein Omelette mit verschiedenen Gemüsestücken und es war sehr gut. Preislich ist es echt günstig und wir haben für 3 Person mit 2 Metern Größe und 95+ Kilo knapp über 30 Dollar gezahlt und waren satt. 
Ich würde hier immer wieder vorbeischauen wenn es  mich in die Gegend verschlägt."}
{"text":"The very best breakfast in town. Very reasonable prices and memorable dining experience. Quality Small Town Excellence.
Highly Recommended :)"}
{"text":"I'm rating this 4 stars only because I never believe 5 star ratings. 
The Pork Chili Verde Omelette is fantastic! The chili is superb! The Bloody Mary w/ bacon is the perfect accompaniment!! Both not too mild, not too spicy."}
{"text":"Service is always great and the people are friendly. The huevos rancheros is the best!  We go there is at least once a month and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Was in vegas for a week and this was the best place we ate all week. We had different meals from chicken fried steak to patty melt to salad and we were all more than satisfied with our meals. A great little spot!"}
{"text":"GREAT diner. So cute. Their slow roasted pork omelet with chili verde is aaaaaaamazing!!!!"}
{"text":"We always make this a stop when making a day trip to the Hoover Dam from Vegas. Everything I've had's been good, this particular time it was the downtown omelet with a short stack (only two pancakes but they're the size of dinner plates, so maybe they should rename it the \"short and wide\" stack or the \"stout\" stack). Both were excellent, service was friendly, and the price was nice - especially after several days of being in Vegas. 

Include TCC on your next trek to or through Boulder City, and go hungry! Go on a weekday morning and you shouldn't have a problem finding a table or parking."}
{"text":"My family and I went there because my dad saw it on that show diners, drive-ins and dives. It's just a regular diner, there is nothing special about it. I got waffles and they were bland, and they give you too much butter. I had some of their gravy and biscuits, which were meh. I would have given this 1 star but their staff was great, the nicest people around. Go here if you are looking for nice people and a pleasant vibe, but the food is whatever, maybe even just actually stick to a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Husband had to try the chili verde pork omelet since it was the dish featured on Diners, Drive- ins, and Dives. I got the smothered burrito. We both agreed the burrito was better, all the same ingredients plus refried beans, rolled up into a tortilla- it was delicious! I would definitely come back and order it again, and try something else on the (huge) menu. 
I just love small town diners and this one did not disappoint. Half of the customers were regulars and the staff knew them by name- love that!"}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast on the way to Hoover Dam. Everyone was so nice and the food was great!"}
{"text":"I am a regular and love this place! I love the coffee and chocolate chip waffles...winner!!"}
{"text":"Come early, just squeezed in before 2 p.m. for a quick late lunch, was well worth the drive. The service was fast and friendly. Food was delicious, good selection of items, can't go wrong with the turkey wrap or for larger appetites try the Big Kahuna burger. Definitely lived up to their reputation!"}
{"text":"In the name of our new traditions, my husband and I absolutely had to try this place during our Las Vegas stay, so up and out this morning and to Boulder City we went.  There was a 20 minute wait at 11am on a Wednesday.  So, if that tells you anything... Once we were seated, we got coffee pretty quick and placed our orders.  The place was packed and they have 2-3 servers for the whole place, so the longer than usual wait for breakfast was understandable.  I ordered the Pork Chile Verde or something like that, my hubby got the Papa's Chili, and my mom had the Huevos Rancheros (names are not exact but you get the idea).  I tried my husbands, and both mine and his were pretty darn good.  My mom seem to enjoy hers a lot as well.  We both go a good portion of pork for a breakfast dish plus mine came with pancakes but we love to eat, so we also got a fresh baked cinnamon roll.  It was very tasty but could have used a little more frosting.  The coffee was terrible but that is expected of a dive.  

One thing I recall from DDD is the mention of very low priced meals.  The price is good for what you get, but I don't think it's outrageously low or anything, especially if you are used to the crazy low casino breakfast prices in Henderson.  Our meal came out to about $26 (before tip) for 3 people and we were all satisfied.  

Bottom line: If you are in Boulder City or even South Henderson, don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch the other day and was seated and offered a high chair for my son. The person who offered it disappeared for a bit and then returned with the high chair and then informed us that the restaurant was closing in 10 minutes. If you would have told me at the door that the kitchen was closing I would have gone somewhere else. We were then rushed into ordering before we were ready. It was really annoying how the server was making remarks about how the highchair was in the way and it might accidentally get tipped over. I work in a restaurant and am always aware of highchairs and everyone in general. Not once have I ever seen a highchair get knocked over by a server. That being said, the atmosphere was uncomfortable because the restaurant was \"closing\" and you could feel it in the air from the employees. 
The Bloody Mary with Bacon boosted the ZERO STAR to a TWO STAR"}
{"text":"I usually don't do omlettes but the pork chili verde omlette is the truth!
It's only about a 20 minute drive from Las Vegas but well worth it. 
The chilli cheese burger was really good too. Nice & crispy."}
{"text":"This place was put on the radar for me after watching the Food Network show, Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  We were going to be in Vegas anyway with a rental car and thought this would make a nice 1/2 day trip.

The cafe is nicely appointed and comfortable.  We were sat right away and the service was prompt and courteous, not overly friendly but we weren't put off by the staff at all.  Here is how we break-down our experience:

Chicken Fried Steak with country gravy- 5 stars.  wonderful gravy, great steak - not fatty or chewy at all, very tender.  My partner had this item and I would order it for myself.
Pork Chile Verde Omelette- 3.5 stars.  DDD convinced me to try it so I did.  It was good, not great.  Sauce could have used a little more umph...with seasonings.  Probably needed a bit more salt and a litte cumin wouldn't hurt either.  Cumin is a wonderful spice to add to these types of dishes.
Coffee- not good at all -1 star.  Folgers or Maxwell House or something!!!  But it was only $1, so what do you expect?
OJ - tasted like it came from a frozen tube concentrate -.5 stars.  Large is only $2, so again, what was I to expect?

After breakfast we walked around Boulder City and checked out the local businesses and antique shops....+1 star to this review for the wonderful city of Boulder City."}
{"text":"It's always a beautiful drive up from Vegas into Boulder City.  The way to finish the road trip is to stop into The Coffee Cup.  They have an extensive menu, and I recommend all of it.  The Mexican style breakfasts like Huevos rancheros are the best.  Portion sizes are huge so it's better to split with someone.  The staff is always pleasant and knowledgeable.  It's also located right on main street so that you can have a nice walk afterwards."}
{"text":"Awesome - we really loved the vibe of Boulder City. This restaurant is laid-back and the food is flat-out amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for the famous bloody mary.  We had heard through the grapevine that this is THE place for bloody marys specifically because they put a piece of bacon in it.  =P  As we walked in we were dodging people waiting for their name to be called.  This is a pretty famous spot in the BC...have you seen their episode on Diners, Drivins and Dives???  Gotta check that shizzit out!  One of the chefs literally cracks 180 eggs in 180 minutes!  Whaaaat?   He's a maniac!

Okay so back to the visit...The lady at the front greeted us with a smile.  The place seemed a little chaotic I think just because it was so busy and it was 10:30am on a Saturday.  So as we explain that we don't need to be seated to dine but were only here for a bloody mary.  The girl pointed our way to the back.  All the way to the back was a tiki looking bar.  Funny being that we were at the \"Coffee Cup\" and there is a secret bar in the back. lol  We ordered our 2 bloody marys to take with us to sit on their front patio.  She filled the glasses with ice and then the vodka.  Seriously the glass was half vodka!  Then she poured the bloody mary mix on top.  We asked it we could have it spicy and she said it was already pretty spicy so we just went with that.  As she continued to add the little extras (celery, olive and a piece of BACON) I was checking out their décor.  They have kind of a beachy theme going on displaying surf boards on the roof.  Again kinda funny again hence the name of the place. I immediately think coffee and breakfast not so much being on a beach with a secret tiki bar in the back.  lol  I like it...kinda quirky. ;)

So we found a seat on the front patio.  It was fun just sitting there people watching.  Lots of different people there.  I couldn't figure if most were tourists or not.  I would imagine a lot of BC locals come here for breakfast.  The restaurant is surrounded by a touristy strip mall with a lot of antique stores-if that's your thing.

The bloody mary was a little on the spicy side.  I liked the kick.  I'm not really a bloody mary girl and it was super strong.  Each time either of us would take a sip our noses would automatically scrunch up. That is no joke! LOL  I really just ordered it to say I had one.  The BF on the other hand enjoyed his AND the half of mine.  Needless to say he was a little loopy for the next hour till we had lunch.  Cute little spot....we will be back but next time to eat!"}
{"text":"Best place in Boulder City for breakfast or lunch. We had 2 eggs, toast, bacon and 1 pancake with bacon. For was good, staff are very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"You have to try this place if your in Boulder City.  Its very small and very busy but worth the wait. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table but it was well worth it. Not much to choose for a vegetarian but we had the grilled cheese and fries and it was awesome. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The breakfast menu isn't anything special. I stopped there on our way out of town in Boulder City, but I'm glad I didn't go out of our way. For a spot called the Coffee Cup, the coffee was pretty horrible: watery and bitter in the wrong way. My omelet was plenty of food for one person - eggs, peppers and onions. I ordered the cinnamon roll, but it was a tad dry and not gooey (it almost tasted like it was frozen and heated up). The fruit side was awful, as if the fruit had been sitting out for a while and got a slimy layer. 

The place had charm, and the service was friendly enough."}
{"text":"Pit stop for breakfast on our way to Hoover Dam. We chose this place per recommendation of.... Guy Fieri and Triple D.  Food was well worth the price and service was awesome! Everyone was friendly and food came quick."}
{"text":"This place has the best Burgers , the staff is always friendly. A must visit if your in Boulder City. One of the few places left without the corporate, cookie cutter feel. This is more like A old fashion family owned establishment . Never had a bad meal, and very fast service. Easy five star diner . love the Decor inside makes one think your at a Beach Cafe."}
{"text":"Best Blood Mary's and bacon! Truly everything our party ordered was good. Love the decor of the place. The pictures of people really make you wonder who it is, the dollar bills are also fun to read. Also, love that it has a full bar even though they aren't open at night - truly a great place! We had a 20 minute wait, which isn't too bad considering it was a Sunday morning, and that this place is on Diners, Dives and Drive-ins!"}
{"text":"Good food , good environment! My kids loved the Mickey Mouse pancakes and I loved the chili verde omelet! We ate there twice in 1 week! We actually enjoyed eating at the counter better than at a table!"}
{"text":"I really like this place but it is always busy! It's always hard to get seated so we always have a bloody Mary while we wait. The servers are nice and the food is good. It is a cute little dive with a home like feel. I am vegetarian and the have done substitutions for me. So that is a plus!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for breakfast after Las Vegas trips. We stop by on our way back to Phoenix. Once you check out you want to go to another place out of town. Nice atsmophere, good service and good food. Perfect trio."}
{"text":"The best bloody mary's ever!!!  The people are the best!!  My husband loves the mary's but most of all the place is his personality through and through, ie boaters, military and bikes.  He feels like he's at home there.  We always love to go to Vegas but our favorite part is coming home stopping at \"The Cup\" for breakfast."}
{"text":"I believe the other reviewers when they say that this is the best breakfast joint in Las Vegas, Henderson and BC combined.  I only had the omelette which was unbelievably great.  It truly was."}
{"text":"Today I had the green chili pork Verde and eggs it is good stuff the service was also good great restaurant in Boulder City"}
{"text":"every time i visit my parents at the veteran's cemetery, i stop off in boulder city for bk or lunch.  i usually hit one of 2 places but after seeing big trap guy fieri on diners, drive-in's and dives i figured i had to try the coffee cup.

10:00 sunday morning - it's busy but i'm solo so i nab a counter seat - i like the feel of this place although you gotta laugh - surfboards on the wall - dream on !!

all the servers are teens/ early 20's - fair number of them tatted .  coffee, ice water, pork chili verde omelet ( no potato/toast - still low carbin' ! )and a side of pork sausage patties  - cost $12.

the pork verde - good flavor, tender - i was expecting a larger serving but that's ok.  the sausage patties - ok - nothing special - my guess, sysco supplied.

the service was very good, pleasant experience !"}
{"text":"My cousin and I stopped at the Coffee Cup on our way back to Henderson from the Hoover Dam.

I loved the decor, service, and food! What a welcoming atmosphere.

I ordered a cinnamon roll (homemade!), homefries, and bacon. My cousin ordered biscuits and gravy with bacon & eggs. All of the items were fresh and delicious!

Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Coffee Cup is my favorite place to come get breakfast! It is worth the drive in to Boulder City and the wait to be seated every time. As a complete coffee snob, it helps that I like their coffee, but service is always fast and friendly. Admittedly, I have only had breakfast here, but I'm sure their lunch is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Great place , had the \"must try\" papas con-chili verde w eggs.... Unbelievably good ! my wife kept stealing my food cuz she couldn't believe how good the con-chili verde was."}
{"text":"We decided to make the 35 minute drive from Vegas to Boulder City to have breakfast at The Coffee Cup because it was on an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. 

We came on a Saturday morning (Valentine's Day no less) and the wait was about 45 minutes but the hostess advised us we could get a Bloody Mary or mimosa at the bar while we wait. We decided to walk around the town while we waited. 

We got sat and the boyfriend opted to try their pork chili verde omelette (which was featured on the show) and he thought it was delicious. I got a waffle with bananas & chocolate chips in the batter & while I'm normally not a big fan of waffles this was absolutely perfect. The coffee was good and the bloody Mary's were perfect. 

Service was amazing, had multiple people always stopping by to make sure we were good. The food came out fast & the prices you can't beat. Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"After a trip to Black Canyon we stopped for breakfast, About a 15 minute wait. Great service, food was out quick.
Try the freah cinnamon rolls, they are really good.
I had \"The Hangover\" Bisquits, gravy eggs and sausage topped w/ ceddar cheese.
Very good meal. 
Also ordered at our table, the Godfather Burrito, waffles and pancakes. Everyone commented how good the food was. Check out the bent prop collection on the wall outside. Also great collection of old water skii's and a speed ski (that is pulled behind a drag boat at high rate of speed.
The sign outside is pretty cool as well."}
{"text":"First off, nothing fancy, this is a diner... But, I have eaten here a couple times and will be coming back many more to make my way through their menu. I have not tried the coffee so that is not part of my review. However, the service, friendly people and the food have all been fantastic. I sat at the counter all three times and engaged in good conversation with the owners and employees. The two dishes I tried were the Chili Verde Pork Omelette and the Huevos Rancheros (had that twice)!. Seriously, one of the best I have had outside of New Mexico. They make their own Rancheros Chili sauce in house and it is DA BOMB! Secondly, they slow cook their Chili Verde Pork and it is tender and very tasty... I will be going back soon to try their famous Peanut Butter Waffles and many other dishes to come... Note: They were featured on Triple D and this place gets really busy on the weekends, ALWAYS! But, it is worth the wait for it generally isn't that long...."}
{"text":"A little Soul Food at the Coffee Cup is what I wanted, and that's just what I got, I thought I'd try a little something different as we walked into the smell of frying meat and coffee, so I decided to try the fried pork chops with mashed potatoes,  it was good, greasy and covered in gravy the meat was nicely fried and the potatoes added a good starchy balance, but honestly this breakfast was a little heavy for my tastes, I know, I know what do I expect I ordered fried pork chops, so I guess I got what I asked for, it was just a little much  The service was fast and friendly and the head cook/owner was incredibly nice, making us feel welcome, and  inviting us to come back soon, nice guy, great cook, good old soul warming food."}
{"text":"On the way back from Vegas my bf and I got kinda hungry so we decided to look up some restaurants that were featured on Diners, Drivins and Dives (DDD) which is what we typically do when we can't  decide where to go. We found this place located in Boulder City and decided to check it out. The mini town that surrounds this place is filled with cute little shops and antiques galore! When you walk in the first thing you will notice is the collectic/crazy decor that covers every inch of this place. This place is first come first serve and seating is VERY limited and only offered inside. The staff was very attentive and friendly. It reminded me of an old school local family owned small diner where everybody knows everybody. 

To eat we both had the egg white omelette, which was a good and healthy choice for us. We found that if you are looking for healthy eats this is NOT the place for you. After a weekend spent in Vegas we need HEALTHY! They are known for their Huevos Rancheros with the pork chile verde and their Bloody Mary but we were both driving so unfortunately were unable to enjoy what is said to be the best! On our way out we grabbed two coffees to go and they were both Great! Next time we stop by this place we look forward to trying some of the recommendations our waitress suggested."}
{"text":"Even though I'm a local the food never disappoints and the staff goes out of their way to make sure you have what you want. If need to wait, wait."}
{"text":"Out of all the places we dined at, in the week we were in Vegas, this was by far the best. We stopped by here for lunch, on the way back from the Dam. The chicken fried steak is excellent, and the bacon Bloody Mary wasn't bad either. Out of the 4 of us in our group, everyone loved it. You can't go wrong here, if you love down home American food.  It's well worth the stop!!"}
{"text":"This gem is one of a kind! The location, staff, food, decor, and coffee (omg, the coffee!) are all incredible. The breakfast menu covers all the bases with some uniqueness. Every food item that came to the table was divine. I even found a delicious Vegan option. I already alluded to the fact that coffee is top-notch, but you KNOW the coffee is good when somebody that does not like coffee orders a cup after a taste-test. I must also mention how kind and genuine I found the staff - they treated me and every guest like friends & family. I selected this venue since it was on the way to Hover Dam, but I will make this spot a \"destination\" on my subsequent visits to the Las Vegas area. Well done, The Coffee Cup! Tip: Head to the bar in the back if you want a coffee or some hair of the dog that bit ya' while you wait for a table during peak hours."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from Las Vegas locals so I took the drive. WHAT A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT from beginning to end. To start our waitress was as rude as they come, actually made us feel like we were a bother. Then we ordered their world famous Bloody Mary's which were not drinkable, tasted like liquid horseradish and nothing else. I ordered two eggs and corned beef hash which turned out to be nothing but chopped up hamburger, as I let everyone else at the table taste it and they all agreed, no corned beef in that order!! Everyone elses food was served cold. Breakfast for three people including the drinks was $50, not worth the gas it took to get there! Save your time and money and stay in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place on our way from the Grand canyon to vegas.  We did not know that they close at 2pm, but we were lucky to get there just in time.  The place was almost packed, when we entered in but  we were greeted right and seated right away too.  We ordered pork chile verde omelet and huevos rancheros as they seemed to be popular items there.  Foods came out fast and they tastes great! I expecially loved their chile verde!  The staffs were nice and attentive to fill our drinks.  If we were in the neighborhood in the future, we would definitely stop by again! It is highly recommended!

{"text":"While visiting the Hoover Dam, we wanted to stop at The Coffee Cup and enjoy a breakfast. It was a Friday morning and quite busy, but the lady at the register was quite efficient and no one waited longer than 5 minutes to be seated. My husband had the Huevos Rancheros and I had the pancakes with bacon. But before that we enjoyed one the homemade cinnamon rolls. It was delicious! Everything was delicious. The wait staff was attentive and even offered my husband a coffee to go. We highly recommend this restaurant if you are in Boulder City. Wished we had stopped here for lunch than where we ate the day before.... See my other review if interested in where that was."}
{"text":"Our new favorite go to place after a trip to Vegas!  This place is the perfect diner experience.  We were surprised to see that there were literally no adults running this place the day we were there...all young ladies..some look like high school students. But you now what??  They were fast, friendly and efficient.  Great food and a great price. The cinnamon roll was to die for.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for an easy breakfast on the road. Place was cool with a lot of decoriation and a diner-style theme. We had the french toast and the bagel sandwich. Both was good, and so was the chocolate milk. The waiters were very nice so service was good. Would go again for some breakfast/lunch when in Boulder."}
{"text":"We stop here fairly often when we're in the area and usually really enjoy everything. A Bloody Mary and/ or coffee is a great way to start your day. I've ordered a couple different items but my favorite is anything with the pork chili verde. The employees are pretty friendly and the restaurant has a lot of fun pictures and things to look at while you're waiting for your food."}
{"text":"Went about 9 months ago, forgot to update.

Overall it's not bad, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Great food as always !

Today the service and attitude of the servers totally sucked !"}
{"text":"Food was awesome.  Service was great, forgot our waitress name but she was a blonde lady with a nose ring and she was awesome.   Had the chicken fried steak and eggs.  Great place"}
{"text":"My family and I were passing through town and had a craving for brunch. We heard the coffee cup was good so we decided to try it out. Hands down the best restaurant for brunch that we have ever been to! We all ordered something different, sampled a bit of all, and it was all delicious. For any time I pass through or visit Boulder city, the coffee cup is going to be a regular stop."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, service and even better food! Located downtown in the heart of Historic Boulder City, this Diner has the best biscuits and gravy and cocktails for brunch!"}
{"text":"Great, authentic breakfast spot on the way to the Hoover Dam. Omelets were excellent and the wall decor is pretty cool as well. Definitely would come back if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"You walk in and instantly greeted by a smile. No matter how long the wait is I promise IT IS worth it. To make time go by, order a mimosa or a Bloody Mary. I promise you won't regret either choice. 

The food.... never disappointed. Food is always quick and tastes amazing. The waitresses are always there to check up on you and I love that they all work together as a team. You'll never have an empty glass and will always be made sure everything is to your liking! Customer service is their speciality!!!! 

Now let's move on to their walls, I've been there more times to count and I still have looked at everything! The walls are filled with memorabilia and they're plain awesome! Now the owner I have come to figure out is just about the nicest and most sincere man you'll meet! He remembers his regulars and even if you're not he'll still make you feel welcomed and at home. 

The Coffee Cup is worth the drive and the wait! A+ team and service! The best sundays always start with Them!"}
{"text":"The Coffee Cup is exactly what you'd expect in small town America--a busy diner with a heavy breakfast menu, local flair (decorating and employees), and seating at tables or a bar.

The food is pretty standard; go there for the experience instead."}
{"text":"A Boulder City tradition! Can't go wrong here as indicated by the line of people constantly coming in for breakfast~
   Look around cuz they offer a fresh something baked daily ~ we had a cinnamon roll which was Outta Site.
   Very free with the coffee refills and very pleasant servers too!"}
{"text":"Took the advice of fellow Yelpers and tried the Chili Verde Omelette. Delicious! Tender pork, tasty sauce, just a little kick. We only wished we had ordered a bowl of extra chile verde. The sourdough toast was even awesome. We also ordered a peanut butter and bacon-filled waffle. Topped with plenty of butter and maple syrup, it was the best waffle I have ever had. 

We went at 12:30 on a Sunday and only waited 5 minutes for a table. The waitress was polite and the food came out quickly. The prices were very reasonable. If we ever end up in Boulder City again, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Small place but very good. We had a group of 16 so we ordered ahead. After touring Hoover dam, this was a fun stop. 
I had roast beef, everyone's food was great. Friendly service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This little place is GREAT! My boyfriend and I went  there on a Saturday morning and there was a 25 minute which totally was worth the wait! You can't go wrong with anything you get everything smells and tastes amazing! The service was very quick and all the staff were super friendly! This is definitely a place to bring the whole family! Kid friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service, nice atmosphere in a beautiful little town. Treat yo self!"}
{"text":"For me, in Boulder City, this restaurant IS as it gets. I'm not going into detail, because y'all can just simply watch the DDD episode and see for yourself. I know that I've been going there since they were on the corner. And if you don't go at the right time, you'll be waiting in line. Not for too long, though. That's what the little bar is for. Have a bloody mary or the yummy little rummy drink, outside at a tall table, while you wait. If you are antsy, these will ease you right up. BTW, I finally had a waffle and holy cow, it was good! I tasted the breakfast chili verde pork. Here was my face O_O"}
{"text":"I checked this place out for the first time this past weekend. I have to say overall it was a good experience. The food is pretty tasty with a homemade presentation, portions are just right for a great price! The coffee is amazing!!!Served in a simple coffee mug, a bit stained but I felt like it just added  more to the homemade experience (so if your looking for fancy and sparkly this is not your place). The staff was is very nice but extremely busy, they are upbeat and pleasant but don't expect too much of a personable experience because they have lots to do and can't stick around to chitchat.  Also, If you want more of a relaxed experience I would recommend that you don't sit at the counter unless you want to see all of the action.  Lastly, the decoration is busy also with lots to look at while you wait for your food. I will definitely visit this place again for the great value, good quality, friendly service and unbelievably delicious coffee!!"}
{"text":"We decided to leave Vegas for breakfast in Boulder City this morning. As we drove through the historic part of town, we see this cute looking little cafe with a ton of people waiting, so we decided it must be good. We go inside and give our names and then decide to sit at the bar for what looked like a killer Bloody Mary. They put a strip of bacon in it. My husband said it was outstanding!
As we waited for our drinks, I asked the bartender how the owner came about using the surf/skateboard and ski/ snowboard decor. She tells me she's from Lake Arrowhead and her husband is from Huntington Beach. \"You're one of the owners of this awesome place?\", I say.
We order another drink all the while chatting with her about our hometown, kids, the cafe and when we go to pay, she tells us the second round is on her. She made us feel as if we were regulars and she'd known us forever. We both ordered the Cali omelette. The fresh spinach was cooked to perfection as were the mushrooms, onions and peppers. Delicious!!! Everything that passed us looked amazing. I saw fresh blueberries on a waffle and gigantic burgers.
This was without a doubt, a fabulous place to stop and eat and we will definitely go back at least once a month!!! Do yourself a favor, and pay homage to this little gem of a cafe. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing drinks, and amazing staff!! Also the environment and decor is killer! Def a one and only and a must try place in Boulder NV!!"}
{"text":"Just walking in, it was a bit confusing simply based on decor. But the staff and the local customers are so welcoming and kind. The waitresses are really pretty!! I was surprised because of it's small town feel. The decor is a cross between a tiki bar and a coffee shop and a dated diner. The menu is extensive and everything is delicious. From the chipped coffee cups to the bloody Mary in a plastic cup, I adored everything about it. The bacon is thick, the portions are generous, and there are pictures of Guy Fieri on the walls. The food is fantastic.  I'm definitely going to spread the word about this gem!"}
{"text":"We were headed from The Red Rock Resort in Las Vegas to Laughlin on a Sunday morning and decided to stop in Boulder City for lunch. I had seen some good reviews about The Coffee Cup and decided to give it a try. We got there just before noon and being a Sunday in May it was a bit crowded. We opted to wait at the bar. Lucky for us there were only 3 others at the bar as its pretty small (4 or 5 stools) w/ not much area other than that. Being that it was still Sunday morning, we ordered a couple of Bloody Mary's. Come to find out they are quite popular at The Coffee Cup... they make their own mix and serve them w/ a slice of bacon. Don't cringe... the bacon is cooked just right and really compliments the drink. We were called to a table before we had finished our drinks and took them with.

They are open from 6 AM until 2 PM daily and serve both breakfast and lunch. They are known for their Pork Chili Verde and you can order it by the cup, bowl or in an omelet... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Meh, the Bloody Marys are less than fair and the waitresses all have resting bitchy face...why is this place so popular?
 I dunno....maybe because its old and considered a 'classic'.  

If it just takes a piece of bacon in the Bloody Mary to make people go ga-ga...well then there it is. It has a piece of bacon in it. I'd prefer a good flavor in my BM over one piece of bacon and a couple of olives. But, I like my BM's with lots of depth and spice but not too hot that distracts from tasting the flavor...these seem to be just a basic bloody mary mix with some extra hot sauce in it.  Not sure why all the hype about these. The Bloody Mary's were less than expected.

the foods okay and cheap. Serving sizes are average. Think diner/coffee shop food. Which is exactly what it is, I guess. The food was as expected.

Maybe the waitresses are better during the week when they aren't so tired from the weekend crowds. They weren't rude, exactly.  They just didn't even seem present or in the moment. They seemed bored, angry that they had to be at work on such a nice day and unhappy to work there. Service was less than expected.

Extremely long waits.  I'll be back, maybe, just maybe; if I'm near there when it's not a weekend and I've some extra time to kill and I'm hungry....
I doubt it though, as there was nothing that enticed me to come back, other than it wasn't terrible. Is that a good review? I guess it's not bad one.."}
{"text":"My co-worker loves this place.  We went based on her recommendation.  Great atmosphere - food was OK.  Highly recommend the green chile pork.  The bacon was salty and the coffee was just...coffee.  Service was good as they are very busy.  Would I go again?  If I am in the area."}
{"text":"This is a pretty darn good little hole-in-the-wall café! First and foremost the food was pretty darn good, especially for being just a small little unassuming place, and my wife has declared it one of the best green chili dishes she's ever had.

First, I'll get the bad news out of the way: I'd give it 5 stars if the service was a bit better, the girl who took our drink order had no clue what beers or sodas the place had, and when she finally said \"Yes, uh, we have Michelob\" my father-in-law ordered one and got a Michelob light. Soo...service definitely lost them a star. The girls who took and brought our food though were very good.

As for the food, as I mentioned the wife loved her chili. My parents and my in-laws enjoyed their dishes, and I had a breakfast dish that was very well done. I ordered my eggs over-medium, which is basically how I tell if the cook knows what they're doing. It came out -- as it almost always does -- over-easy instead, but it doesn't surprise me anymore. Almost nobody can cook a proper over-medium egg. However it was seasoned excellently and the rest of the dish was delicious. Given how much everybody else enjoyed their food and how much I enjoyed mine I'm not even worried about a slightly-underdone egg!

Will definitely be back here to try the chili next time I'm in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Got referred here by the local Alpaca store owner.. Yes, Alpaca :) anyways , it has a fun cool vibe. Very friendly servers and the breakfast was delicious. On the way to Hoover Dam this is a stop you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"This place has people coming and going it's faced paced and busy. I'm assuming that's why a lot of the stuff is pre-made. The server was nice and informed me when I said I didn't want certain things on my Godfather Breakfast Burrito that it's all made and mixed before they open so nothing can be taken out. I said that I'd go ahead with the burrito anyway and it has hot Italian sausage with veggies, cheese, potato, and scrambled eggs inside a flour tortilla. The size of the burrito was good especially for only $7.50 but the taste was just average. The only thing hot about the sausage is that it was hot from being cooked but it was not spicy at all. Olives are very noticeable in a dish and this burrito had a little too many inside for my taste. I opened up the burrito on the plate and ate with a fork around the olives and mushrooms the best I could. A little cup of salsa came with my burrito that was so-so, I'd prefer the salsa chunkier and maybe a little bit more than they gave given the size of the burrito so the customer doesn't have to ask for more because I have to assume they do. I had some of my wife's bacon and pancakes and it tasted good. I'd probably try something with pancakes next time if I stop by again. Also if you like a good Bloody Mary my wife enjoyed hers and apparently so do other people because just about every table had one on it."}
{"text":"The pork chile verde is everything they say it is. I literally couldn't stop eating it. The coffee is good too which I'd hope from a place called 'the coffee cup.'

Friendly people, good service, awesome food. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Guy Fieri was here years ago and featured the pork chili verde omelet.

I don't normally order the \"featured item\" on the menu, but it sounded good, and seemed to have great value.

It was okay. I had chunks of fat in mine.

Wasn't impressed with anything, really.

My friend's huevos rancheros were better than acceptable.

What's not acceptable was their version of \"home fries\" aka a cold baked potato diced into big chunks. People at our table don't normally send things back to the kitchen, but we found ourselves requesting that the potatoes actually be cooked. Hmmm, yeah, imagine that.

Wait was very long, which might have created slightly higher expectations."}
{"text":"This place has it all: quiet, small town atmosphere with delicious food and good service.

I went for the first time yesterday; my girlfriend wanted to show me what it was all about, and I did not walk away disappointed.  Located in the heart of historic Boulder City, you'd probably miss it if you weren't looking, but it's a gem.  Walls are filled with old license plates and memorabilia; like a time machine, it takes you into the past.

Menu was very reasonable and had a ton of different foods.  I had a bacon, lettuce, tomato and egg sandwich with hash browns, and it was great, plus a side of strawberries, OJ, and the best cinnamon roll I've ever had (freshly baked).  It was so soft, it melted in my mouth.  

Our servers were very nice and always made sure we were taken care of.  Prices were good for a place seen on the Food Network (not outrageous or jacked up).  

I'll make the trip to Boulder just to go back here again and again."}
{"text":"Great and quick service and delicious food! The portions are big. The pancake I ordered was a size of a plate! Will be back when I go back to Nevada!"}
{"text":"We found out about this place on Diners, Drive in's and Dives and boy was it worth our 40 min drive from vegas.

1.  Fresh baked cinnamon roll in all it's ooey gooey glory
2.  I had the Downtown Omelette filled with crispy bits of bacon, oodles of cheese, onions and tomatoes and topped with more ooey gooey cheese.  My other two peeps got the pork chile verde omelette, and that was very flavorful, too
3.  Went all out and got WHITE toast... see the butter glistening?!
4.  Here's what was the best of the meal!  My test of every breakfast place:  CORNED BEEF HASH.  OMG!  It was perfect.  more perfect than paul's country kitchen at its best!!!!  It was crispy, salty... did i say crispy?!  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm *drooling sounds."}
{"text":"Before it was anointed \"the Triple D\" place, I knew it as the local spot where my kids would meet with their friends and have breakfast on the weekends. It was always busy and they closed early, so hubby and I missed out since it never worked with our schedule. Then Guy Fieri chose this place to film his first episode here then BAM!  Super busy to the max! So forget about coming here for awhile!  The hype has died down somewhat now thank goodness. We've only come for breakfast and the few times we came during the early morning hour we go it's not too terribly busy, clientele is mostly made up of locals and city workers and a few tourists on their way to/from AZ.
  
The food is alright.( more like 3.5 stars rating just bumped up for A+ service/ambiance)  It's just your basic breakfast dishes being served up. Cooked to order.  Generous portions.  I usually get the infamous Pork Chile Verde. I like the green chile sauce used and stands out from the rest of your normal breakfast fare.  This past visit though I deviated and tried the Cali Omelette, which had spinach, mushroom, tomato, and green pepper,olives, and onions. Pretty much a veggie omelette. Not sure though the spinach used was the fresh variety, because it smacked of canned or frozen spinach. Sorry to say that kinda ruined it for me.  So note to self: pass up on this dish. 

Service has always been excellent though and The Coffee Cup still has that homey, small town charm about it. That's what keeps us coming out here."}
{"text":"Excellent bloody Mary's and breakfast here!  Came on a busy Sunday morning and was lucky to get two seats at the counter with no waiting. Our waitress, Kacey, was super friendly.  My godfather breakfast burrito was huge and filled with delicious eggs, cheese, bacon, potatoes, mushroom, and onions.  It came with a side of salsa.  There bloody Mary's were pretty big and had a thick piece of bacon in it along with celery and olives.  Everyone here was nice and you could tell it was a popular spot with the locals who all seemed to be regulars."}
{"text":"I came here since i saw it on Diners,Drive-ins,and dives. Was definitely impressed. I order the chile pork verde. Excellent choice. Now my mom order chicken fried steak and well i NEVER order that in a restaurant for i have been disappointed one too many times. But, let me say  my mom made me try it and i was very surprised on how good it was. I literally craved it and went back a month later for a plate of my own :=)"}
{"text":"Took a drive out to Boulder to explore and we stopped at this little restaurant because it looked very busy with locals a plenty.  We figured they would know good food in Boulder City....oh they do.  It was so damn good.  Thick crisp bacon and amazing breakfast potatoes.  We had the chili verde and it was like heaven in my mouth.  Great fast service and the prices are totally aceptable.  I heard that this place gets crazy busy on weekends so expect a wait.  I will definitely make this long drive again just to hit the Coffee Cup!"}
{"text":"Feels like this place belongs somewhere like Huntington Beach, CA...

Someone here loves surfing and I was reminded of home as we sat and ate here. It's a little place so don't be surprised if there's a wait. All the ladies working here were very sweet and worked hard with a smile on their faces the entire time.

The food was ok, didn't leave me dreaming over anything. We had simple breakfasts and my least favorite was the super gristly steak that my man ordered. The eggs, potatoes and orange juice were good. 

Located in downtown Boulder City which I love, it's a good breakfast option but in my opinion there's better options right down the street."}
{"text":"Have to say they do make a mean Bloody Mary and even better hang over food : ) food comes out super fast I swear once we placed the order the food was on the table."}
{"text":"This is a Boulder City staple! It's usually busy and that's for a reason! The service is on point and friendly. The food is delicious and speedy! They even have booze!!! You won't regret stopping here. You'll find locals and tourists here. Whether you're having the \"as seen on food network green chile omelette\" or just pancakes and eggs, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this place and it did not disappoint. The country omelet is a meal in itself. Served hot fresh and was absolutely delicious. Broccoli scramble was outstanding. Coffee is good, and the service is friendly. Very interesting decor."}
{"text":"Guy Fieri's judgment can be pretty hit or miss, but the other reviews for this place are pretty accurate: the pork chili verde is their best dish, offered as an omelet and over hashbrowns. If you're a breakfast person, maybe you'll prefer the omelet but I got that and wished I'd had the 'browns version.

Chili is delicious: flavorful and meaty, with just a bit of heat! Pairs perfectly with the texture of the hashbrowns and topped with cheese. I deconstructed the omelet and mixed everything together, hence my recommendation for the hashbrowns version.

Rye bread, as Norm said, is cut entirely too thick- so much so that it went uneaten at our table. Biscuits and gravy dish was okay- biscuits were fluffy, gravy wasn't gluey but was a bit on the bland side. Best bet is to stick with what they do best: the pork chili verde!

Friendly staff, kitschy décor, and bacon Bloody Marys are the other strengths found here! Worth the wait, particularly since there are so many little stores nearby to browse."}
{"text":"Really like their food. I've eaten here numerous times and it's always good food and good service. Sometimes the wait can get lengthy but that's really the only downside to eating here."}
{"text":"Can get pretty crowded on a weekend morning!  Food is good, nothing too special.  Crazy beach themed decor, the staff at the front comes off a little... \"irritated\" and was honestly kind of uncomfortable putting my name in... the wait staff was friendly and quick.  Been here twice, and think that's enough, we liked Southwest diner up the street way more!"}
{"text":"Food Good.  Service Good.  I would eat here regularly if I lived in Boulder.  Just go try it."}
{"text":"So delicious! We took a trip out here from LA and stopped for a late lunch. Absolutley the best fried pickles in the universe! Great bloody marys with just the right amount of kick to them. Worth a trip for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow...it looks like Guy Fieri has quite the following! I actually stumbled upon the Coffee Cup with my posse after a hard day's gamblin... simply because it was the only half decent place in Boulder City. 

Nothing special really. It's just a diner with nostalgic Americana on the walls. Someone had mentioned earlier that the wait staff was quite attractive...well, I guess we were unlucky cause our server looked like a crack junkie after a rough night of working the streets :(

I'd recommend the chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite breakfast places in Nevada. This place is famous for being on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives. Every time I want to spend time around Boulder City walking around my family eats here. 
 
Service has always been quick. Employees are always nice and food comes out quick. 

The food. Oh the food. There is something for everyone. breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and they do have a menu filled with comfort breakfast food."}
{"text":"Coffee Cup is by far one of my favorite places. It might not be on the strip or super close but it is worth it. They are open bright and early at 6 and close at 2 pm. This is one of the best places for breakfast. I haven't had a single menu item they I didn't love. Not only is the food delicious but the decor inside is so different. You are sure to find something that catches your eye. Coffee Cup has the best breakfast!"}
{"text":"Mayo on a steak sandwich????? Is that a normal thing? So sad it was on there I ended up eating just the steak with no bread because mayo wasn't disclosed and totally ruined the sandwich. Wasn't disclosed on the menu either, other than that it was awesome, service was great, food was fast and high quality at a fair price."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. They get busy for a reason. Had to wait 45 mins to be seated, didnt mind cause the food is really good. The Chili Verde is amazing. Friendly staff, great food."}
{"text":"Was in the area and came here just on a whim. The diner feel in historic Boulder City was perfect. The food was good; I had the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs. I don't typically like gravy but theirs was good. And my food would've been just fine without all the anti-Obama, anti-government, pro-war stuff decorating the place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Service is good and the food is just right. Very homie feel fun atmosphere. This is our second time stoping in. We stop here on our way home from a Vegas trip back to Phoenix. If your in the area it is a must !"}
{"text":"Feel like visiting a fun coffee shop in Mayberry ...well here you go.  I love this place.  It's has a fun beach feel to it and it's always busy, watch out for weekends.  The bacon cheeseburgers and fish sandwiches are killer, the fish always hangs over the edges.  Breakfast hangover time you've found you cure.  My friend loves the SOS, which is gravy over toast and hashbrowns, one of my favorite treats is the peanut butter, bacon waffle, drench that baby in maple syrup and it's pure heaven.  Say Hi to Al, the big burley guy, he's the owner."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow! This place is a little hidden gem.

We passed through Boulder City on the way to the Grand Canyon during our stay in Las Vegas, we decided to stop at this cafe due to the brilliant reviews.

When we arrived I wasn't sure that we had made the right choice as this place looked like a very regular small American cafe, how special could this place be?? Well the answer is VERY!!

The staff were so friendly and the menu was extensive! We were seated straight away after the waitress rearranged some tables to accommodate our large party.  We started to look around and realised there was a lot of memorabilia and pictures relating to the Navy Seals, so when we looked around and asked questions it became clear that this was relating to Shane Patton who was represented in the movie Lone Survivor! It turns out Shane hailed from Boulder City and of course this town is extremely proud of this war hero and want to show their respect and love for him, such a humbling experience to see this first hand.

Ok so back to the food-I ordered the hangover breakfast which consisted of biscuits (savoury scones) with eggs, sausage, bacon and gravy (a thick creamy, spicy sauce). Doesn't sound like much but it was gorgeous-I loved every bite but just couldn't finish it all.

Others ordered the breakfast pancakes and said they were the best pancakes they have ever had!

This is such a charming and inspiring little town and even my short visit affected me quite a lot, I could see how nice the people are here and hope to return for a longer visit some time in the future."}
{"text":"Like most tourists, I found myself here driving home from Vegas to Phx. I suppose when there are two breakfast spots in a town, it's not hard to be the best.

Food was ok, not amazing. Service was kind of weak. I don't expect much for breakfast service, and God knows I am not awake or fun in the mornings- but try a little bit. I forget the name of the other spot in Boulder City, but next time I will try that out."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for breakfast on our way to the Hoover Dam. A couple people in my party have been The Coffee Cup before and insisted that its a must every time they go to Vegas. 

We walked in, and right away i fell in love with its atmosphere. They have a very friendly staff (its hard to find that in LA). The walls are even covered with $1 bills on one side of the restaurant that tourists put up with their names, date of visit, etc. 

They have such a wide variety of Mexican and American breakfast plates. My mother in law ordered the chile verde, very tasty!y boyfriend ordered the breakfast sandwich which had egg, cheese, and bacon in a croissant. Delicious! My sister in law ordered a burrito which was massive in size. The sauce was mild, but very flavorful.

I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes. I have been on a 6 month long search all throughout Los Angeles for chocolate chip waffles as deluctant and perfect as The Coffee Cup, but this is the only place that I know of that makes choc chip waffles with the chocolate chips inside of the waffle, rather than on top. My next trip out to Vegas, I am definitely coming back for waffles!"}
{"text":"We made sure we stopped at The World Famous Coffee Cup Cafe on the way out from Vegas to the Hoover Dam over Memorial Day weekend.  Kinda exactly what I pictured.  

Kinda thought it would be a little more fun, though, but it was like any other diner experience.  Order, eat, leave.  Nothing special, really.  The food was decent, the service friendly, bathrooms clean.

Probably wouldn't go back, but glad I did it at least once only because it's \"World Famous\".

There are some fun little shops next door.  If you are looking to get out of Vegas for a few hours or are on your way to Hoover Dam, I would probably recommend stopping in for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"The chili verde omelet was unique and delicious. Also, customer service was great and excellent atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The coffee cup is one of the great breakfast  and lunch diners. It's not far from Las Vegas so the tourists coming out to the dam can stop in and get some great food. I've had several of their dishes but seems to go back to the juevos rancheros. They Ranchero sauce is what does it,  the crispy tortilla and refried beans are just fillers. The egg is cooked just the way you ask for it, but that Ranchero sauce!!! The huge chunks of tender slow cooked pork and jalapeños, along with the tomato and sauce my mouth is watering now. If you're feeling hungry get it with the pancakes. What they do to their pancakes I don't know nothing special but they are so awesome. Thick yet fluffy and washed down with a couple mugs of coffee. The coffee is light but packed with caffeine. My suggestion get there before 8 am on a weekend if you want to avoid the wait. Otherwise enjoy the other side, their bar,  while you wait and do some shopping at the local shops in the area."}
{"text":"After reading several Yelp reviews, we decided to try this cafe before heading out for our Lake Mead cruise.

We went on a Wednesday morning, so there was no waiting for a table.  The decor reminded us of places you would find in the beach resort areas, which we enjoyed.

The menu is extensive and it was hard to decide on what to order.  I did order the Chile Verde omelet which was very tasty.  We sat at the table that had Guy Fieri's autographed poster/photgraph mounted on the wall above it.

Overall, our pre-tip amount was about $45, for four breakfast meals was a bit pricey even for food this good.   We would eat here again but not make special trip here just for eating here."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the quaint little places in Boulder City.  The service here is friendly, and it is as close to a 'diner' as I have ever been in.  I wandered in one morning on a Sunday looking for a place to get some caffeine and a bite to eat, and in here I found both.

The owners are great people. I've seen them around the town many times.  And it shows through their restaurant.

They serve CRR coffee, as do most places in the city.  It's quality coffee, and its local.  Plus its served in a custom \"Coffee Cup' mug and that sort of brought it home for me.

The food is quality.  It's not crazy creative or cutting edge, but its straight up good diner food.

A good diner is about three things.  Good food.  Good coffee.  And good all around atmosphere and service.  This place serves up all three and does so quite well."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service !!! The best chili verde ever!! If you are ever in Boulder City stop by the coffee cup. You will not be disappointed. Everything on the menu is excellent. Parking is close by and the surrounding shops are cute  antique stores. Love the town and love the coffee cup"}
{"text":"Love this place. Family owned. Best bacon I've ever had. Always friendly and quick service. Great job!"}
{"text":"Not a bad wait for a Saturday, especially since the other breakfast place in town is closed for Easter weekend. Pork chili verde is delish as advertised. It was on the heuvos rancheros as well. Sausage gravy was pretty good also, which is saying a lot since I don't like sausage gravy. :) friendly staff and good service"}
{"text":"A cute, hole in the wall Boulder City institution. They are always busy, which in a small town is the best indicator of where to get the best food- and at this little diner it's also the best price! 

My personal favorite is the classic burrito with a side or two of their amazing homemade salsa."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to stop and eat breakfast here. The staff are super friendly and the food was delicious. The wait time was 25 minutes and we killed time by walking around the antique shops next door and across the street. If you are making plans to go to Hoover Dam or the Grand Canyon make a special trip for breakfast here, trust me you will not be disappointed. 

The menu selection offers a little bit of everything for everyone, I tried the huevo ranchero with a mimosa to drink and my husband tried the Country Fried Steak w eggs and hash brown, biscuits and gravy and a Kentucky Mule to drink . The food tasted so delicious we ate almost the whole plate considering the generous size portions ;)  I will most  definitely make this my go to spot next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Back to Vegas for New Years, stopped by the Coffee Cup yesterday and we are back again today. The Chile Verde omelet is worth coming back for. We also had a couple of Bloody Mary's today which were great. 
Papas with Chile Verde and eggs, the bomb!
Service here is the best on top of a great menu."}
{"text":"This is a great place! The breakfast is really good..... that's all I've had from there. The people are friendly and it's clean. It gets very crowded though. I had the chile verde omelette, chocolate chip pancakes, and huevos rancheros.  All three were great"}
{"text":"Amazing little diner type restaurant!  Wonderful food, first class service and all at a reasonable price! I enthusiastically recommend The Coffee Cup restaurant to anyone that wants a fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"Drove out from Vegas to check this place out and was pleasantly surprised! There's a bar and you can order a drink while you wait. I did t have one, but their bloody Mary's looked amazing. Super affordable too. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. I definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Good place to get breakfast.  I was afraid we would have to wait a little while to get in, but we got lucky and were seated right away.  The staff was nice and helpful.  The food is very good.  Everything we ordered was cooked correctly and tasted good. Go check it out, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Decided to take a last minute road trip out of Vegas towards Arizona, and ventured off the highway to check out the quaint town of Boulder.  It was breakfast time, so we decided to find a place for coffee and something small to eat.

First off, the coffee was great.  This is no small feat - I often find coffee to be either too weak, too strong, tastes burned, you name it.  However this was right on (and the wait staff kept refilling without asking which is an immediate 5 stars for me!).  Beyond the coffee, you could tell the family that owns this little place really cares about the people who eat here, and that flows down to the wait staff who are as equally friendly and pleasant.  

Now the food.  I had no idea how much to expect, but I certainly didn't expect to be given half the kitchen for the prices we paid.  Seriously.  I am pretty sure they make no money on food because the portions are large, generous, and most importantly delicious.  Next time I'm in town, this will be on my go-to list for sure!"}
{"text":"I'd actually give this place 4.5 stars. A cute and casual restaurant in the middle of Boulder City. We stopped in for brunch after antiquing in the area. We ordered the Chicken Fried Steak (with eggs, gravy on the side, home fries, and toast) and the Papas con Chili Verde. 

Overall the food was very flavorful and fresh. Although the steak was tasty and fried perfectly, I was slightly disappointed that the breading did not properly stick to the steak. About half the breading underneath the steak  came off when I received it. Their chili verde on the other hand, was super flavorful, seasoned perfectly, and had a nice kick to it which we liked. The chili also complimented the potatoes nicely. Portion sizes were very generous and prices were affordable.

Very good and friendly service. This place is only open for breakfast and lunch. If you plan on coming here during the weekend or peak meal times, be prepared to wait. Get here a little earlier because you will have to find street parking."}
{"text":"My fav place to have breakfast. Cozy local dive restaurant with amazing food. The cinnamon roll is a must have"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for the weekend and searched to find any Triple D spots in the area.  We decided to try the Coffee Cup after a morning tour of the Hoover Dam.  Arrived at about Noon today (Sunday, July 4th) and the three of us were seated within 5 minutes.  We had the Pacific Burrito, Caliomelette and Papas con Chili Verde...with a short stack of blueberry pancakes for dessert :)  All were WONDERFUL, and we came back to the hotel so full that we had to cancel our dinner reservations for a well-known restaurant here in Vegas!  My daughter made herself eat every last bite for fear she \"might never get to eat here again.\"  Service was congenial and responsive, too.  When in Vegas, we'll definitely make time to travel to Boulder City again just to eat here."}
{"text":"Cool people, cool place! Great breakfast! What a find! Definitely a local's joint. French toast was great with powdered sugar and cinnamon! Waffle with pecans cooked inside topped with bananas and whip cream-excellent-no need for syrup! The bacon is thick and yummy. Bloody Mary's and the bar rocks! Try the rumzilla as well!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff from the moment you walk in. Very attentive. Coffee, vanilla milkshake and hot chocolate was delicious. Note: only vanilla and chocolate flavors available for shakes. Pigs in blanket are huge, shared with kids and they loved it. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"After 8 years in Las Vegas, I finally made it out to Boulder City! I actually was just here to drop off some materials for work, but I decided to stop into The Coffee Cup for a little snack before making the trek back to Summerlin.

I must have arrived at a good time, because it wasn't too busy and there was no wait for a table. The service was friendly but definitely brisk. Unfortunately, I wasn't very hungry, even though there were lots of tasty (and affordable) looking things on the menu. I finally settled upon a cinnamon roll, thinking it would be a small little treat before I started driving in the heat again. It was only $2.50.

I certainly wasn't expecting such warm, gooey, goodness! This was a huge roll, with amazing melting frosting- AND a huge pat of butter in the center just melting into it. All I could say was WOW!!  The taste- sublime! I made myself stop eating it because I started to feel my arteries clog a bit.

I don't have occasion to visit Boulder City very often, but I think I'll be back here!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, delicious and the absolute best bacon Bloody Mary ever! We waited at the bar and chatted with one of the owners and bar tender while we waited for a table - he gave us the background and added a huge piece of bacon to the tasty Bloody Mary. Didn't take long for a table to open and us to sit down. Waitress was lightening fast, and the food came out shortly after that - no time wasted. Portions were more than I could eat - Hash was DELICIOUS! We'll go back....as long as I'm not dieting..!"}
{"text":"Was in town so stopped by based on the yelp reviews. Thought everyone was pleasant with generous portions and decent prices but honestly, nothing really special. Would eat here again if I was in town but it's not worth a special trip IMO."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious. Burritos are big enough to share and the 1/2 order if French toast was still 4 slices. Coffee was hot, staff was friendly and food was good. Will stop again next time I'm in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. Great food with many unique offerings. Very simple casual ambiance. Prices are fair with big portions. They have a connecting bar with great Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's. A must stop whenever you are in Boulder City."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  If you want some great breakfast food in a homey diner, than this is the place for you!  There aren't too many places like this left, especially in southern Nevada.  The staff are incredibly friendly, the patrons are real and not pretentious, and the food is delicious!  I've only been here three times but have gotten something different every time which is quite odd for me at breakfast joints.  This time I got a single biscuit and gravy (which I love that you can do) and the Papa con Chili Verde.  This was quite a good amount of food and I was very satisfied after leaving there.  
The first two times I came here it was ridiculously crowded (for good reason) because we came on the weekend.  This last time I came on a Tuesday morning and was able to walk right in which I was quite surprised at.  It's a bit out of the way but I really feel like you will like this place."}
{"text":"I can not believe it's taken me this long to stop in and eat. I usually just drive by and see all the people standing outside waiting to get in. 
I have a few friends whom being asking me to ride the motorcycle down and eat breakfast. So today the wife and rode our bikes down and had a front parking spot. Had to wait about 20 minutes for our table. But it was a beautiful morning. My wife and I thought it would be a wise choice to order two different items and share. 
We ordered the French toast and a the God father burrito. They were both mighty tasty. And very fulfilling. We both didn't eat all the food. Also the iced tea was very refreshing."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way to Hoover dam on 06/26/2014 because i saw they were on diners, drive-ins, and dives.  Place is really good.  I had the Pork green chili verde omellette and it was awesome.  Im not really a breakfast guy, but this was really good!  They should bottle that stuff and sell it.  Wife also had soemthing called a hangover special which she says was very good, but huge!  Definately if your going to the Dam you gotta stop buy."}
{"text":"Have the corned beef hash , 2eggs and hash browns. I eat there about once a month and you can't go wrong. The fresh brewed ice tea is the best. 
When friends come into town from the Midwest  this is a must stop!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We just tried to eat here after all the gold reviews on yelp. It was my wife and I and 4 kids. We were told we would be seated in just a minute. After waiting 20mins and watching parties of 4 and 2 be seated no one wanted to further acknowledge us. No just one more minute or we are waiting for that one table. We just sat there.. was extremely rude. Bunch of young girls running it not giving us the time of day so we will take our money elsewhere. My dad lives in Boulder city and raves of this place but very un welcoming."}
{"text":"Pork chili verde with hashbrowns was awesome!!  This place gets busy and stays busy.  Expect a wait but it is well worth every minute!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place, from several different people.  Tried it out and I was unimpressed.  It was breakfast on a Saturday.  The breakfast itself was nothing to write home about...  And, the bloody mary was so strong, it could hardly be consumed."}
{"text":"Huge breakfast burrito, divine cinnamon roll, fun collection of classic water skis. 

This place is about good food, the 1970s river rat subculture, and the good ol' USA.  A Boulder City must-stop as featured by Guy Fiere."}
{"text":"The most amazing chicken fried streak to date! If going on the weekends be prepared to spend a good 30 minutes waiting but truly worth it. Bloody Mary's are a MUST!!! Extremely reasonably priced. Randy was our amazing server, extremely attentive, personable and just an all around people. Fun little surfer inspired cafe on the Main Street in Boulder City. Just fantastic."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Service was friendly and prompt. Food was great and you get large portions for the low price."}
{"text":"Came here out of the Diners, Dives and Drive-Ins episode.  It has been on our list for a while but never seemed to make it.   Well worth the trip.  Friendly staff and of course the food was great.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I remember eating here before but didn't realize it was featured on diners drive in and dives so I wanted to go back.   Arrived at 10:30 am and was a 10 to 15 minute wait.   We were lucky to get a parking space out front. The wait wasn't too bad.   Everyone was friendly and service was great.   Food came out fast.   I had the godfather omelet which was tasty but way too salty.   Same with the husband's meatloaf.   I could taste onion soup mix in it and overload on salt. Son said his chicken fried steak was good and not salty.  The egg on my omelet was paper thin and I finally found the cheese in the one corner.   The hash browns were nothing to write about.  The water was from the tap not filtered.  The portions were normal.  Prices were average  $9.50 a meal.  Coffee was another  $2.00.  The inside of my coffee cup was stained.   Honestly nothing impressed me.  When we left at 11:30 there was no line.  It's definitely a dive and I won't go out of my way to go back.   I've had much better."}
{"text":"The Pork Chile Verde Omlette.... that is all. 

This is very much a hidden gem, and I encourage everyone to seek this place out. 

The pork chile verde here is ridiculous. I almost asked for a pot of this stuff to take back to CA. It was very flavorful and not too spicy. The hash was okay - mix it with the chile to make it better. 

My husband ordered the peanut butter pancakes, and I'm afraid I ate most of them. No regrets there. The edges were crispy with a soft center. It's just what I love on pancakes. 

Just remember that if you head here, make sure you've got a full tank of gas. It was quite a drive to get back on the freeway (heading home to CA from Vegas) from this place - and there were NO gas stations for a long stretch. 

Another major plus to this place: This is a hub for veterans.... Army / Navy / Marines
Complete strangers opting to sit together to share stories of their time in the service. If one person fell short on their payment for their meal, another would pitch in to cover. 

Kudos to The Coffee Cup. We will be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"The breakfast croissant sandwich is excellent. I frequent the coffee cup for breakfast as I work only a few miles away and I've never been disappointed by the food or the service. Prices are good, food is excellent, staff is very friendly. Probably the best breakfast restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"After learning this place was on Triple D my family and I decided to give it a try. The food was amazing! I had the chicken fried steak, my son had pancakes, and my husband had the omelet featured on the show. Everything was so fresh and quick to come to us. The service staff were all very friendly and quick to serve you.

They offer mimosas and bloody Mary's which is great for breakfast! It was a Sunday when we went and it was crowded (which we expected) but we got in under the time that was originally given to us which was nice.  

The only thing I was a little disappointed in was the coffee. The place is called the coffee cup so I guess I was expecting at the very least different flavored creamers or maybe lattes but nope just regular coffee with basic creamer and sugars. 

All in all I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. I will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"We were in the area so we stop by for some good breakfast. It's so yummy. Great food. Great service."}
{"text":"High quality food.  Friendly service.  Decent prices.  What more could you ask for.

Conveniently on the way to Hoover Dam from Las Vegas.

Only downside is they close at 2pm but they serve breakfast and lunch until then."}
{"text":"The wonderful things you will find in Boulder City. It not very often at all that am in Boulder City but on this day came out too support friends, yelpers, and wanted too get sense of tri world. Since was in the area and all my tri friends was telling me need too check this small little restaurant out literally walking distance from the finish line. Hell yay! Talk about busy sure having pumpkin race was obvious reason but probably just as much once walked in realize that the restaurant been on DDD. So even more excited too try the food out because comes too DDD or Man vs Food. I like too check out the restaurants if given the chance. 

The decor is pretty crazy. I love the old school breakfast counter look (the whole counter area was filled too the max) or throw back dinner look. On the walls its all over the place but enjoy the long board, and lot of the stuff with surfing or things use too growing up in the islands. Really everywhere you turn you head like different scene with the decor.

I ordered simple just reuben sandwich. Sometimes its the simplest dishes that can be the easiest ones too mess up with food. At The Coffee Cup they do amazing job! The bread was perfect nice crispy, nice portion size of corned beef on the inside nice and hot, the sauce believe was thousand islands but whatever the case brought the whole sandwich together, and less not forget the sauerkraut that was good too. The fries were fries nothing special. It was perfect reuben sandwich too end long day of races and really the whole menu looked great although can only talk about the reuben. It great laid back old school atmosphere that get together with friends over coffee, breakfast, or lunch just chill. If I loved closer too Boulder City would come by more often. If I do make it out again sure one restaurant must stop while in Boulder City this is the spot."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! Friendly staff and neat decor as well."}
{"text":"It's a real surprise having such a good breakfast place here in Nevada. Being a New York transplant, I am always in search of a restaurant that would remind me of the East Coast. 
I had the Godfather Omelette and my friend got the Chili Verde Omelette, which I got to try ... Amazing! The pork was so tender it melted in my mouth. It was like butter!   
When we got there, it was to be a 30 minute wait, but 2 counter seats opened up and we immediately grabbed it. All in all we just waited for less than 5 mins. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Really, I wouldn't have minded waiting even if the counter didn't open up right away. The place was packed and I now know why. This is a must for people who are willing to go the extra mile to eat good food. 
With such accolades I am giving this place, one might ask why am I only giving them 3 stars? They are called the Coffee Cup so you would expect to have good coffee or at the very least, decent coffee. Their coffee is not at all good. The only redeeming factor about their coffee is that it was served hot. Naming your place Coffee Cup should start with good coffee not mediocre coffee. If the owners are reading this review, I hope you try to find good coffee purveyors. I understand food costs but there are better  coffee brands that wouldn't break your bank.  Your name should be synonymous to your product. 
I will still be back though - coz your food was good enough that I could ignore the crappy coffee."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast place in Boulder City. Old time charm with all the regulars coming over for coffee. Breakfast are decent, diner type with no thrills or sophistication. Good balance of ingredients and no real surprises. Decor is Americana (kinda surfer / military / collection of licence plate and coffee mugs). Service is attentive and not imposing. Pricing is a bit on the high side given the location and rather basic food."}
{"text":"Boulder city staple for many years even before DDD. If your going to Lake Mead you've probably stopped and had breakfast or lunch here. Family owned and operated it's busy from open to close. It's not the biggest place either so be prepared for short wait. There are small shops all around to kill that time if you choose. For what it is it's a great place."}
{"text":"Visited this place near the Hover Dam it was great , very busy lots of people like me tourist but we got seated quickly,the cafe was featured on the food network and the food was good the price is very reasonable. reminded me of an old town style kinda cafe I will be back for sure when I'm in town...."}
{"text":"Not a bad diner but completely over glorified from popularity due to Food Network show Aired there . It's a clean and nice diner with your usual compliment of breakfast and lunch menu items ."}
{"text":"There seems to be some confusion between here and Mel's Diner, but I don't remember, and they both show up as separate locations when I look it up.

This was the turnaround point for our group after coming from vegas, taking the Hoover tour, and driving over that Dam.

The food was respectable.  We went during a hot period and it was air conditioned inside so that was a relief as well.

I forgot where I read it, but this place was suggested as a little stopover, and I definitely wasn't disappointed.  Most of the stuff is well priced."}
{"text":"The coffee cup is a reliable, quality diner in Boulder City that is almost always busy but other than that it's great - if you like good old home cooking and healthy portions you should stop by here next time your in the area and see how moma's cooking tastes in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Great food, we stopped for breakfast, had the pork chili Verde omelet. Typical diner type atmosphere with memorabilia plastered everywhere. I'd go back."}
{"text":"One of my friends kept raving about this place. I was hesitant just due to the fact that it was a good 45 minute drive at best. They finally got me there one morning and I am glad they did!

The service was friendly and prompt and the food was worth the drive. I ended up getting bacon pancakes which were fluffy and baconriffic.

I'd also recommend the Bloody Mary. Maybe I am just a sucker for a bacon in mine but either way it was delicious."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago we decided to stop by The Coffee Cup on our way to Indio. We ate there once before and had liked it quite a bit.

We ordered their famous pork chili verde omelet. We also got the huevos rancheros.

The chile verde omelet was awesome. The pork was super tender and the sauce was delicious.

The huevos rancheros were good but not great. We got them with a side of pancakes which were quite good. 

We had a 40 minute wait, but it was well worth it.

It's a fairly large restaurant but there's only one women's and one men's restroom, so I had to stand in line for the restroom for a bit.

Definitely would recommend this place if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"As far as diners go, this is a good one. Not much to look at but she (The Cofee Cup) has a great personality and can cook a hell of a meal. We got the pork chile verde omelette, a crispy chicken salad, a grilled cheese sandwich and a breakfast plate. Everything was as good as you could hope to get from a diner. A perfect stop on the way to or from Hoover Dam or the Grand Canyon (from Vegas)."}
{"text":"If you are touring the Hoover Dam, YOU HAVE TO EAT HERE!! Just 20 miles from Vegas. They take food to a whole new level. A must is the pork chili verde. The waitress informed us this dish is what they're known for. I only found out later when I looked up the recipe that they had been featured on Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins on the Food Network. We also shared the lunch special, a tuna melt on grilled sourdough bread with jalapeno peppers, served with fried pickles. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This cafe was amazing!!! We read on Yelp how wonderful it is, and even had a few friends suggest we stop by. We definitely weren't disappointed. The decor was so awesome!! It had a rustic old school cafe feel. The service was great! Our waitress was prompt and kind.
I had an omelet that was beyond delicious!!!! The cheese, eggs, and ham all tasted fresh and very good!!! My mom had the French toast and she loved it! We were both stuffed afterwards. The portions are perfectly large!!
We used the bathroom before we left and we both agreed they were impressively clean (such a relief). The lady checking us out recommended us to stop by a local store, and we were thankful!

Great spot!!! I would send everyone here!! I absolutely plan on returning!! My school is nearby, I'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast! The smothered burrito had the best flavor! It had the best hint of spice and tender chunks of pork all over my perfect breakfast burrito. The eclectic atmosphere was so much fun. 
It just so happened a power outage occurred right after we received our meal. The service continued to be super even with the lights out! Loved everything about the place, people and the food!"}
{"text":"Love.This.Place!!! The huevos rancheros is to die for!  And the bacon bloody mary....amazeballs!!! There is always a wait on the weekends but it's totally worth it! This is the best spot to bring friends and family to when they visit. Top notch service, fabulous food and the location can't be beat!!"}
{"text":"It is not often that a place that I have desired to try truly exceeded my expectations.  The Coffee Cup does that and more.  I had the Papa Chile Verde with a side of Corn Beef Hash.  The Chile Verde just melted I. My mouth with fresh and robust flavors that did not overwhelm the balance.  The corn beef hash was light, hot, slightly crispy with perfect texture.

Wonderful atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"Theeeeeeeee best bloody Mary's in Nevada!!!!!! I was told their bacon secret from the owner! He was hilarious! Sorry to hear about his current health conditions...
This place is own and ran by a husband, a wife, a son, a daughter and other helping staff, mainly Boulder City residents. Great and friendly place! Plenty of regulars there including us! 
Love their homemade cinnamon rolls! 
Their smothered green burrito is great, but I always add bacon to it and a side of avocado. I love their BLTA which is a BLT with avocado! Yummmmy! Gosh their bacon is just amazing!!!!!! Love love love this place! We like to take a ride up on the Harley on Sundays from Vegas and start our day out at this lovely homey place nestled in the heart of BC."}
{"text":"Small and cozy with a cool atmosphere. Good quick service. Not as cheap as expected. Eggs and hash browns were nice and hot."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Whenever friends from out of town come in to Henderson, I make sure they try this place at least once. There's a reason that the Chile Verde Omelette was on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives (although I've never seen the episode). My dad claims that could be the only item on the menu and they wouldn't lose any business. It's pretty damn tasty. I think the only one I've had better was at Kay's Country Kitchen in Old Town Orcutt, out in California. The sandwiches I have tried have all been amazing. This is definitely the best breakfast in town. Better than Southwest is or Bob's ever was.

The girls are always super nice from the moment you walk in until after you've paid and are walking out the door. And Ryan(?), the owner's son/bartender is a blast to sit back and kick it with. We came in one Father's Day and hung out with him while waiting for a table. We talked about boat racing, bike racing, Father's Day projects and purchases and it was just a good time. By the time we left the bar at 10am, they had already gone through 3 bottles of vodka for the morning's Bloody Marys. Oh, the Bloody Marys. They've got some spice to them and are garnished with a super thick, crispy slice of bacon. Deeeelish.

The decor is super cool. Skis on the wall and hanging from the ceiling. Racing props along with prop and impeller carnage out on the front wall. Teak swim platforms converted into counters. License plates EVERYWHERE!

If you happen to find a parking spot in front of the hardware store, that's nice. But instead of cruising up and down Nevada Hwy, I always find a spot open right behind the restaurant. The only guys that get closer are the Harley riders on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Always great especially when you came on a motorcycle. With my brother in law Carl on a Slingshot"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise, heading out to do some hiking and stopped here for breakfast. Cool local cafe vibe; very friendly wait staff and killer breakfast. The papas con chile verde was delicious and the perfect meal before a long hike. The green chile is meaty, and flavorful. My wife had the chile verde omelette which comes with a stack of their delicious pancakes. We are Vegas locals and this is now our favorite breakfast cafe, beats anything on the strip!"}
{"text":"Wait can be long but worth it! Huevos Rancheros is yummy, crossaint sandwich is crave worthy and pancakes have a touch of powdered sugar in the batter!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We were staying at Bally's and a valet attendant, Mike, suggested this place because we wre on our way to visit the Hoover Dam. We took his suggestion and it ended up being the best place we ate at during our entire trip!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The service is great and the food is delicious! My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwhich and I created my own omelet. They both were very tasty! Will be going back. Ambiance was very cool!"}
{"text":"If I could give more than 5 stars to this great eatery, I would. Where to begin??? The ambiance is old-school meets surf shack. The food is delicious, plentiful, and totally comfort-food. The best part of my experience here (other than the awesome Bloody Mary) was the staff: welcoming, hospitable, gracious, funny, they run this restaurant like a Swiss watch, yet make you feel totally at home."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and their chilli Verde is awesome. While the food is worth the wait, the wait can be rough if outside. Look to walk around for a while unless you like to be surrounded by smoke.; however, there many little shops you can wander in while you wait. Mgmt should strongly consider moving smoking areas away from entrance. If the wait is to long, we look for a different place to eat."}
{"text":"We decided to wake up early and take a nice drive to Boulder City for breakfast. The place is casual and laid back. There was a wait for a table, but it was quick. We enjoy spending our time and supporting local restuarants with friendly staffs. We ordered the Chili Verde Omelette (a bit on the spicy side), coconut waffle extra crisy (it was done right), and chicken fried steak with eggs over easy (the gravy was ok and the fried steak was crispy). The coffee could have been a bit stronger, but the Bloody Mary was just right. It would have been nice if they pointed out their signature item or mention any special of the day. Overall, it is a good place for breakfast."}
{"text":"My friend took me to Boulder City for a day trip exclusively to try this place! I can now say that my breakfast that day was the BEST OF BOULDER CITY!

She was also telling me that this spot was on the show Diner, Drive-ins, and Dives. Cool fact, but the fact was The Pork Salsa Verde Omelet was OFF THE HOOK! The food was of great quality and portioned well. I was extremely satisfied. The omelet was so good! I need another one of those! The hash brown that came with the omelet, was just different. It just seemed like a REAL LIFE HASH BROWN, I recommend!

Besides the breakfast being incredibly amazing, the service was great too! Our server was the sweetest little thing! She came to check on us at the perfect times! Overall, a great experience!

PS. when you get your bill, you take it up to the cashier... (I found out after my friend had already came back to the table and payed her bill...I was like wait? You already paid?!) Just to make sure you are ready! =D"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great coffee, and oh my God the food!!  We had the best breakfast of our vacation here.  The pancakes and biscuits with sausage gravy were delicious.  I also tried the omelette with pork and green tomatillo sauce that was featured in DD&D - fantastic (and huge).  I wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"I first went to the Coffe Cup on a fluke. My boyfriend and I randomly ended up in Boulder City at 7am hungry, and he knew about all these hole in wall, somewhat famous breakfast spots. Of the 3 diners on the small strip mall, I am glad we ended up here. Its a cute, cozy breakfast/lunch diner that is only open til 3. If you come after 9am, plan on there being a wait. 
This last check in was my second visit. Our party of 4 arrived around 11am, and waited about 20 minutes. There is a cute antique shop next door to pass the time. Or if you are feeling froggy head to the small bar in the back and indulge in a bacon bloody mary for only $6. They also offer mimosas, or a mixed rum drink. There are both breakfast and lunch options. I have only had the breakfast, the bloody marys, and the coffee. ALL WERE WONDERFUL. The kids both liked it, the boyfriend was full and happy. Worth the drive once in a while for a bit of a feel you just can't get in Las Vegas. Old liscene plates for decor, a biker hang out at its finest. I have never gone without seeing a minimum of two motorcycle clubs. And I must mention, they always have cute waitresses. They don't make them wear uniforms, and it adds to the vibe of the place. As much as I want to try the other diners, it will be hard to get me away from this one."}
{"text":"Ok,may I first say this place is realy realy good! I came here after school today for lunch with my friend and my grandfather.I wanted to get the dakota burger but it came with bbq sasue and i wasnt in the mood for it.So i asked the waitress if i could substiute it for the \"special sause\" ANd she said no because, they were alrady made that was kind of disapointing but, oh well.I ended up getting the bacon cheese burger,fries,a chocolate shake,spechial sause,fried pickles.

Bacon cheeseburger-It had a very strong bacon taste and it tasted very good,it was juicy and yummy,the pickles added to the flavor.Id get this again.

Fries-These were very cripsy tasted like they were double fried but im not sure there amazing fries,defently good in ranch,or there \"special sause\"

Fried pickles-I wasnt crazy about these to me they didnt even have a pickle taste to them id not get these again.

\"Special sause\"- Ok this was amazing sause it was sweet yet had a spice to it soo good on the cheeseburger or fries yum!

Shake-Standard but very good and you get the left over part of the shake wich is cool not all places do that,it was good and thick,but not so thick you can't suck it through the straw.

over all i'd come here again,next time ill get onion rings on my burger instead of getting the fried pickles :)Thank goodness it wasnt that crowded when we got there we only had to wait about 10 minutes because someone was in line before us."}
{"text":"This place is a really good breakfast joint. I know it was featured on triple d and sometimes there is more hype than substance, but they actually make really great food. I personally love the huevos rancheros and the omelettes are also awesome. It's usually pretty crowded but lines aren't too bad. Prices are decent so that's a plus and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"High 5, Coffee Cup!, you are our favorite Yelpventure thus far. Maybe because of it being the \"special, Triple D edition\"? We were going to go Saturday but, due to its popularity, opted for Sunday morn (while people are either at church or sleeping in from the nite before). Going from the western part of Vegas, it took just over 30min to get there & was super easy to find (although you'll just see \"café\" on the sign 1st). We arrived in our parking spot at 9:15ish. I'm sure that going on a Sunday had something to do with being able to park right in front of the restaurant but there is also a big sign for a public lot. Coffee Cup is shockingly smaller than I imagined so I was worried about the wait, even though we were 4th down on the list. A half an hour later, we were seated & VERY excited to get our breakfast on. My g.f. ordered coffee then chastised me for only ordering water. She's a big coffee drinker & took one sip if the coffee before shoving it in my face telling me I HAD to try it. I've never been more pleased to have something forced on me... it's good... real good... like satin on your tongue. In fact, after I ordered my own cup, there were several inquiries between the two of us about how the coffee is possibly that smooth. On to our mini-buffet... Biscuits & gravy (dig it that you can order 1, 2 or 3). Being from a small, country, railroad town, I'm kind of a b&g snob & these passed the test! Pigs in a blanket. I'm not a huge sausage fan so a few bites in, it became just blanket. But, the blanket sure was perfect (something about the edge & that they withheld the thick syrup without becoming soggy.). Due to how hearty the pigs in a blanket is, it'd be nice if they offered quantities similar to the b&g. Chicken fried steak. As previously mentioned, I'm from the country, so how is it that I've never had chicken fried steak before!? My g.f. warned me it's one of those things that's either prepared on-point or disgusting. Guess what, folks, it was NOT even a little bit disgusting! I looked at my g.f. with my mouth full of it & asked her if it was made properly (just to make 100% sure!). She agreed, it's pretty delicious. Now, the cfs normally comes with 2 eggs any style AND hashbrowns (the latter not mentioned on menu). Not being huge fans off eggs & needing to prioritize our intake, we asked for just the hashbrowns (&, yes, they too were scrumptious). Over the bar area was a sign mentioning their homemade cinnamon rolls for $2/ea. So, being on Operation: Carbfest 2012, we ordered 4 to go. 2 barely fit into 1 to-go container & we fell into a fit of laughter. Honestly, I wasn't a fan- not dense/gooey(?) enough BUT the icing was very good (& I'm not a frosting/icing lover). Our whole bill was only $31. Sadly, we did not partake in the chile verde but plan to next time. Because there WILL be a next time! A few hours in Boulder City was a much needed escape from Vegas, thanks to a little gem called Coffee Cup."}
{"text":"found this place just driving through on our way to the dam. and wow it did not disappoint. the best chicken fried steak i have had in years!!!

there was four of us at the table everyone loved their food and the water glasses were never empty along with the great prices this place is amazing"}
{"text":"What a neat place and so popular that you may have to wait to get in.  It has a great menu - hearty food - bacon, eggs, etc.  Big portions.  The decor is patriotic - flags, military, etc.  

While you are waiting you can wander up and down the street in old town Boulder City, which is extremely interesting.  There are statues that tell the history of the area and the town.  There are unique stores with antiques, etc.

Take the time to drive up here from the main highway."}
{"text":"Wonderful little place to get an early breakfast. At 7AM only counter space was available. Sat at the counter and talked at length with a local couple that was very proud to be living in Boulder City due to the history during the time the Hoover Dam was being built. It's a real small town with some of the trappings of tourists. The food was exceptional, the environment engaging, staff friendly and efficient. Great place to visit while in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee shop/diner! Get the smothered burrito! Cute waitstaff and you can buy the cup you drank out of for five bucks!"}
{"text":"We spent the day at the Hoover Dam and was craving some iced coffees before our hour long drive home, I kind of stumbled upon this place hoping to order a latte or something but the name is misleading, because they actually do not have a full coffee bar. Just a regular cup of hot coffee. I opted out and instead we sat down and had some lunch instead...Sure glad we did because our meal was great! I had the pork verde and my boyfriend ordered a breakfast burrito. My pork was SO tender and flavorful I loved it, and I had his leftover burrito bits for breakfast the next day...still good! Next time I'm in Boulder City I will have to stop by again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is as good as it gets.  My girl friend had the breakfast Chili Verde Pork and I had Eggs and Hash. Out standing, have to go back."}
{"text":"I have lived in Boulder City for quite some time but don't often get to eat downtown or before 2 p.m. However, I just moved my photography studio nextdoor to the coffee cup and treated myself to breakfast last week. Let me just say everything was FANTASTIC including the service, atmosphere and most importantly the food & coffee. Will be back for SURE!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Family owned for 20 years. It's been around since the 30's. Cute little town to walk around also."}
{"text":"Love stopping at this place on the way home from Las Vegas! The breakfast is amazing and it's super cheap :) the servers are always super friendly, too!"}
{"text":"I come here almost every Saturday morning with my wife. Normally a wait, but it's well worth it. Friendly staff, and my go to is the Huevos Rancheros with the pork chile verde. Sooooo good. Pancakes are fantastic as well. Best breakfast spot in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Absolutely  the best breakfast spot so far. This place has a Pork Green Chili Verde Omlette that is to die for. All meals looked fabulous. As well as tasting fabulous."}
{"text":"Great food and a friendly environment. This place was like a little visit back to Hawaii. We took a wrong turn on our way to the Hoover Dam and figured, what the heck, we should just stop and get breakfast. Such a cool family oriented atmosphere with lots of memorabilia to look at while you wait. The staff was super friendly and our order arrived surprisingly fast. To keep it simple this breakfast was 10/10 by far. Should we ever find ourselves back in the area we will definitely be stopping by. I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"A Mr Pink and the Green Chili omlet, 2 sides of bacon and some bisquits and gravy all make for the perfect combo. Ok, honestly...I had 3 Mr Pinks!"}
{"text":"My sister and I wanted to get away for breakfast one morning so we decided to take a drive to Boulder City and eat at The Coffee Cup.  It was my first time there AND first diner!  WOW did I REALLY enjoy myself!  Aside from the delicious breakfast choices, the whole setting and atmosphere gave me a 5 star experience.  Old fashioned, surf boards, antique license plates, fun photos, sitting at the diner \"bar\" etc. made it a wonderful memory that I'll always cherish!

You have to see it for yourself to understand why this place was aired on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives!"}
{"text":"The menu left nothing to be desired, unless of course you're looking for some fancy breakfast. I appreciated that there were many non grain and non meat options on the menu. The portions were quite large and the prices very fair. The food was better than average and tastier than I expected. Good service and neat atmosphere, especially as a tourist."}
{"text":"We came for a super early breakfast on a weekday. We were about to hike the golden strike trail, it was very close. The service was great, we felt very much welcome, and parking was easy.
I had a breakfast burrito and it was very very gigantic. There was tons of eggs in it. It's very blend though, good for breakfast. 
I also tried a biscuit as a side, just $1, but I don't like it at all to be honest."}
{"text":"Just good if you are hungry n curious. 
Nothing crazy exciting out of the norm but decent food & service!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! okay, to be fair, the food was good, the ambiance: so-so - nothing special... actually, I would have been totally fine with the place: I heard good things from my brother, and there seemed to be a lot of positive posters on the wall. 
Upon eating my delicious food I thought perhaps the waitress maybe was under a bit of stress? so I would give her the opportunity to make it up.

that never happened.


she  was a complete wretch!  

We walked in at 1:24pm, the joint closes at 2pm - BUT, we were timely with our order and didn't take our precious time eating (we left around 2:15pm). The few times I did try making small talk with the waitress -who was clearly not in the finest of moods- she walked away as I was talking!  we cleaned up our table before she took the plates and were cheerful the entire time. 
She was so terrible, I actually said to myself: \"self, I'm gonna write a review on Yelp because her service was terrible...\"  
There was not a thing that transpired the entire meal that warranted such rudeness, and, for the first time in my entire life I left a tip that was less than 10%. 

ABSOLUTELY the worst service, I think that the 55+ year old \"blond\" waitress should retire... or possibly find a job that doesn't involve customer service (maybe she was the owner's mother? ... ... still, I think if she is a relation to the owner, is it really worth the reputation of your business?) 

My family that lives here won't be going back. 

There is a common belief among restaurant owners that regardless of service people will still come in for good food, that is simply not true... if you go to a place with terrible service you will never go back. never."}
{"text":"Great place.  Had the pork chili Verde omelet that was on Diners, Drive ins & Dives.  Yum!!!   Also the Bloody Mary's were awesome."}
{"text":"Cool diner for breakfast and lunch. They are open from 6-2 pm. Service was good and quick once we were seated. We waited about 30 minutes around 8:30 am. The food was worth it. It's a funky low key place. I had the breakfast burrito. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"The Coffee Cup is a great, but you better go quick before they tear it down.  My parents started taking me here  over 20 years ago, and everytime I go the food is delicious.  The fried chicken is great, but don't discount the BBQ chicken which is awesome, or a simple veggie plate.  The sweet tea and lemonade are out of this world, but conserve your drink, this place is so busy that refilling your cup can be the least of their worries.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent diner with super nice staff. Everything is absolutely delicious!  The Huevos Rancheros w/Pork Chili Verde...awesome!  You will not walk out of there hungry."}
{"text":"Best omelette I have ever had!  It was the pork with verde sauce option.... Amazing.  The pancakes are great too.  Great service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We drove through Boulder City on our way to Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon from Las Vegas. I chose to have breakfast here after reading the great reviews. The breakfast was great and the portions were large so we shared the downtown omelette with house fries and toast. Also, I tried the cinnamon roll everyone was raving about and wasn't disappointed at all. You can't go wrong with a stop here. Another great DDD recommendation."}
{"text":"_Not_ a coffee shop. No espresso. And the drip coffee just tastes like water down brown soup to a coffee aficionado. Food is ok. Place is nice and welcoming. Had great service. 
But sorry, coffee is awful."}
{"text":"Very very good food friendly employees! Been coming up to Mead for over 30 years and this going to a regular stop for our family!"}
{"text":"I have a special place in my heart for little joints like this since my family use to run one back in the day. I visited here several years ago and came back on a recent trip to Hoover Dam. Pleasantly tucked away downtown with a smattering of diner like decorations they really strive for comfort. Service was good and the food was out pretty quickly. Settled on the grilled ham and cheese sandwich, home fries, and a cup of chili. Very tasty and not overly greasy. The sig-o got a pancake the size of a Frisbee and a stolen bite was very good. I ordered their meatloaf last time I was there which was good. You can't wrong with this place for some nice breakfast/lunch fare. I suggest stopping here before your trip to the Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"The veggie grilled cheese rocks! Friendly staff, good prices, and really cool decorations. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My brother recommended this place to us. He went when they were on a \"Hoover Dam\" adventure.

So glad he did! I now understand why this place has a zillion 4 & 5 star reviews. The food was great, the service was on point and we had a yummy diner-style lunch!

Not really a fan of Guy Fieri, so the fact that he did a show here is not really a selling point for me. I guess it would be for some. I think he is kinda of a putz...but I digress.

I had the pulled beef sandwich, which is basically their take on a pulled pork BBQ sandwich, really yummy!!! Everyone else on the table had hamburgers, and there were no complaints!

They close early! at 2PM!! SO keep an eye on your watch, and be prepared to wait in line if it is a weekend!"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST place I have been to that has been on Diners, Drive In's & Dives.

A typical no frills diner with good food and good service.

The Chicken Fried Steak was excellent."}
{"text":"Just needed a quick cinnamon roll before we started our day. The staff was great. We never expected this to be so busy but to me busy means it's a great place to eat. I think I am going to make the drive here one of these next weekends to actually sit down and eat here. I will be back."}
{"text":"The Guy Fieri effect is in full motion. 

After hiking around Lake Mead, one must eat and why not cruise to downtown Boulder City and stop at the world famous, \"Coffee Cup\". If you can't find a seat, don't worry it's not you, it's them, this place has been popping off ever since the platinum blonde mayor of \"Flavortown\" set foot in here. 

The waiting isn't so bad, especially when you can enjoy a Bloody Mary or beer from the bar and after a few sips you'll hear your name being called over the PA and soon you'll be elbow deep in greasy spoon heaven. 

The menu is filled with your basic diner foods, chili, eggs, burgers, omelets, and donuts, so just bow down to the Americana. I went with the, \"Godfather Burrito\"; just think of a dinner scene from \"Goodfellas\" with scrambled eggs and hash browns sprinkled on top. This beast of a burrito comes packed with Italian Sausage, Eggs, Onions, Olives, Mushrooms, Green Peppers, Tomatoes, Potatoes, and cheeesse! Holy gut bomb!

If you're asking if it was good... Duh. This is just what my tummy ordered, I'm sure any good doctor wouldn't recommend this meal, but whatever, you only live once or for the next six months if you continue to eat like this. The burrito surprisingly held together even though all this goodness was about ready to explode, salty, crunchy, and spicy it was all here. 

To make matters even tastier, I split a side of biscuits and gravy (Fuck, what's wrong with me?) this was also great; creamy gravy and a dense biscuit, count me in! 

If I lived closer to this place, it would most likely get a monthly visit from me. My heart and colon are happy that The Coffee Cup isn't just around the corner."}
{"text":"Thank You fellow Yelpers!  You continue to give me great reviews with which to act upon.

This place is the trifecta! .... Super Cool.... Local ..... Great Bloody Mary

Plus the other trifecta.... Great Service, Great Food and Great Bloody Mary

I know, I know.... I'm fixated with BMs..... but that's because so few places know how to make a good one. This place does!

And their food is pretty damn fabulous too.
Had their cinnamon roll which was gooey but not too ooey... with just the right amount of bread to dough-y-ness texture.... and really nice amount of cinnamon.  The icing was a bit too grainy for me but I'm not holding that against them.  

We shared their Pork Chili Verde Omelet, and the server was super 'on it\".  She had the entree split onto 2 plates... we didn't even ask for this... they just did it.  So Nice!

The Pork Chili Verde was meaty and savory and Oh So Good!
The eggs were fluffy and fresh.... not hard or fake.
The hashbrowns were standard fare but who cares.... the PCV is so good.

Definitely a great place for breakfast... and I ... will... be .... back!  :)"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday at 12:30 after going to the Boulder City Railroad Museum, the wait for a table was about 15 minutes, not too bad for a full house, heard this place gets packed. Lucky for this party of 4 adults, 5 kids, and a baby we got the last table before an hour and a half til closing. 

 I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, peanut butter pancakes, and the local Boulder City Coffee Colorado River Coffee Roaster (so ono, you can get it at a local Las Vegas Whole Foods or Bet on Farm Farmers Market).  The pancake was sooo fluffy and they use the mini peanut butter chips so you get peanut butter in every bite!  The waitress mentioned you could put bacon in it too, so I think I'll have to do it on my next visit!  The service was good and food was onolicious especially those pancakes.  I would definitely come back again and support this local Boulder City small business!   Support your locals,  eat local!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here.  It's a cool place in a neat location.  The servers were attentive and nice.  And I thought their prices were pretty good too. 

I'm 50/50 on their hash browns.  They weren't bad, but I've never had hash browns like that.  They are thick shaved potato that are fried into more of a large patty.  Interesting but not sure if I liked it or not.  

My eggs and bacon (which they did not skimp on) were great.

The one complaint I have is with their coffee.  For a restaurant with coffee in their name you'd expect a good cup.  However, the coffee tasted like Nescafe or some low end brand.  Not appealing at all. 

I'd go back to try some of their other offerings, especially for lunch or dinner, but I'll be avoiding the coffee for sure."}
{"text":"Yummy food, nice waitresses!

The location is a bit small for how busy it usually is, and it can get quite loud when it's busy. 

The food quality is fabulous and they're nice about substitutes.

The portion sizes are very fair for the prices. 

Their bathrooms are very clean as well, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Before I start this review! I will air out my issues!
Being a dog owner, I understand it's not easy to find a whole lot of pet friendly establishment! I get it, I don't have a problem with that! I chose to own a dog, I chose to bring her with us on trips. I have noticed a lot of restaurants are starting to have out side areas for pet owners which is great! Our dog is 4.5 lbs, she stays in her little black bag, So sometimes, I can even sneak her in, without them noticing it! Anyway, The Coffee Cup has seats outside. It was a nice day, so we stayed and sat our self. Turns out, they are just seats! We have to go inside and order, go back and get our food. They will not come out and let you know that your food is ready? So! Unless you are inside, you are not much of a customer! They do offer refills on your soda, even if you are outside! 

The Coffee Cup is located in a very cute area in Boulder City, like an old main street! Lots of shops, and food. I know this was on DDD before, since were on a road trip I always try to check them out with my wife! 

My wife had their BLT on a croissant! Bacon was a crispy thick cut, it was a pretty good sandwich!
I love chili verde ever since I was a kid, so I ordered their chili verde on hash browns, with scrambled eggs. Very good dish, wife even liked it. I grew up with two different versions of verde. Grandmother had the hot version, mother had the mild version. The Coffee Cup offers the mild version, it was great! 

Overall we had a great time, food was great! Next time in area, we will still come by!"}
{"text":"During our planning stage, my friend discovered World Famous Coffee Cup and it was instantly put on our list. Other than the fact that it was on TV and had great reviews online, it was a logical stopping point for breakfast on our way to the Hoover Dam. We had picked up the rental car at about 7am and were on the road at about 8am. 

We arrived at about 9:30am (had to stop for sandwiches) and was seated right away. Our waitress was super nice and helpful. Service was attentive throughout and they were able to split our check four ways. I'm always super appreciative when restaurants are willing to do this because I've definitely been denied this before (and there begins the \"who will Venmo/Paypal/Chase Quickpay who\" argument). 

I opted to make my own omelet with mushrooms, cheese, and avocado. It was really tasty and a super big portion. All omelets come with bread (white, wheat, sourdough) and your choice of fruit, home fries, or hash browns. I opted for the fruit to make it a bit healthier! I don't think I finished everything in the end, despite having help on some of my sides. 

If you're in Boulder City or just stopping by on your way to the Hoover Dam, I highly recommend a stop at World Famous Coffee Cup!"}
{"text":"Great cafe style place for breakfast. Prices were okay. Service was great and the omelettes are amazing. I'd consider stopping here for a quick breakfast especially if you are considering a chain place like IHOP"}
{"text":"We started visiting the Coffee Cup many years ago after seeing it featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Every trip to Las Vegas for us always includes a detour to Boulder City for breakfast. We are never disappointed! Nice people, great service, yummy food, and the best Bloody Mary I've ever had - period. The chile verde omelet is delicious. Be prepared to wait - especially on the weekend.  It's worth every minute you wait!"}
{"text":"The Chili Verde omelette was excellent and my girlfriend ordered the bacon and eggs with sour dough toast. The bacon was awesome and the thick sour dough bread was perfect!  The service was on it and the coffee was refilled without asking. 2nd time here and we'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great pork chile verde and chicken fried steak. Surprisingly, subpar eggs for a breakfast joint. Reasonably priced and overall very good food."}
{"text":"This establishment has a very rude owner, who happened to be on duty when I arrived. Informed them I am low vision, and had a dog with me. I was abruptly ordered outside with my animal. They have outdoor seating, but informed me I could only have a to go container outside, not a plate. I asked if the container is styrofoam. It is, I was told. I offered that my companion would bring our dishes in after we finished, but was told no, we would have to eat out of styrofoam despite my visual disability. If you care about the ADA, please do not support this business."}
{"text":"What a great vintage diner!  We sat at the counter and watched a chocolate malt being made.   They didn't scrimp on the ice cream! We didn't have the Chili Verde omelette but tried the Huevos Ranchero and the Godfather omelette.   Both were delicious!  The waitresses were friendly and efficient.   Wish we lived closer so we could try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this lil cafe! They have a variety of breakfast and brunch dishes from pancakes, sandwiches, salads and burgers. They also have a bar, can't get better than that! Their service is good and have waited no more than 20 minutes to be seated, we always go on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Second time visitor for the huevos. The green chili is what matters to be a good entree. Wow it's 9/10. Service is 10/10 and the Bloody Mary's are amazing! Good old school small town vibe. Yay Boulder City for keeping the CCD around all these years"}
{"text":"Wonderful bacon cheeseburger,  lots of fries. Real milkshake made with ice cream and a blender right behind the counter. Perfect lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have ever made chile verde is excellent my God 20 minutes to get there well worth it excellent excellent staff great people great atmosphere so good"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast. Good bloody Marys. Family run. Interesting decor.  Highly recommend just to say you've been there."}
{"text":"I ordered the 1,2,3 breakfast along with a short stack and was really looking forward to it since they've been featured on DDD's. The gravy was cold and didn't taste very good and the biscuit was stale. I never received a refill on my coffee as my server (older blonde woman) wasn't very friendly and didn't check on us. Overall - I'm disappointed in my experience."}
{"text":"Before visiting Boulder city, a lot of friends told me upon arriving, that i should stop by and eat at Coffee Cup. Friends told how cute the little cafe was and that its a must! I'm so glad my bf and i did. The place has a cozy, old town feel to it and seems like locals and tourist flock here. This place was super busy when we arrived around lunch time. The wait was 45 minutes, which we didn't mind.. since there were antique stores and pretty cool souvenir stores alike to look at. When we sat down, the service was great! The ladies were all attentive and seemed very happy to work and help one another. That's always a positive sign when workers get along and just make the place flow. They instantly took our drink order and soon after our main order. I had coffee with a waffle and strawberries as my topping. It was delicious! My bf got the godfather omelet and coffee with a side of biscuit and gravy, its really good and different than any other omelet. This place is a must when visiting boulder city or to catch a nice wholesome breakfast or lunch. We both thought this was just a wonderful place that we both got ourselves a shirt! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place.
Good costumer service, the food great.
The mimosas very delicious.

I recommend it this place."}
{"text":"Above average dinner, probably use to be better prior to being advertised on food network. The portions and quality are decent, service could be better. After we were served our food it was the last time I seen our server. I do recommend the chile Verde omlete, kids ordered the biscuits and gravy which was disappointing.  Overall was a decent dining experience,  great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get a bit to eat. I have been there many times and I have never been disappointed.  I would highly recommend this restaurant when you visit Boulder City."}
{"text":"This is the quintessential American Diner and a must if you are in boulder city and looking for a classic American diner. My corned beef & hash was good but not \"all -time\". The Burger my friend ordered looked amazing. My favorite part of the meal was the Bloody Mary \"heated up\" with extra spiciness. Complete with a strip of bacon it hit the spot for a late breakfast/early lunch cocktail. The staff was great and service was fast and efficient. It can get crowded and they do close at 2 - FYI."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast today while on a shopping trip to Boulder City.

We saw this place on television and thought we'd give it a try.

Great food! Friendly, quick and attentive service.

No complaints. We'll definitely stop in here again."}
{"text":"Go on a week day,  very crowded, good breakfast, homemade cinnamon  rolls, great atmosphere, surf boards and memorabilia  all over. Take time to walk around the shops. A hidden gem while leaving Vegas"}
{"text":"Always good, service on the money. Love the cinnamon rolls. Great folks, Great Bloody Mary's, home grown atnespher. Down Town Boulder City."}
{"text":"OMG! I enjoy going to places that \"The 3 D's\" have been too. This past week we went to the Coffee Cup in Nevada, It is a small mom and pop place with great customer service and great food. I had the Chili Verde Pork omelet and my boyfriend had the Chicken fried steak, I so wanted more after we finished them both. Their food had such good flavor. I'm going to Laughlin in Aug and I'm gonna take my mom there!"}
{"text":"Looooong wait and the food is your basic diner, but tasty. The bacon bloody marys are the main reason we go and for a little trip out of town to do some window shopping and antiquing."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite breakfast restaurant. Seriously everything is so yummy! You have to try the cinnamon roll and their works famous Bloody Mary! Unfortunately everyone else knows how good this place is so there is ALWAYS a wait....but well worth it!"}
{"text":"The Coffee Cup is a great little breakfast and lunch (not open for dinner) restaurant in downtown Boulder City. The vibe inside is great, decorated with unique memorabilia on the walls.

Our service was great, very friendly server. I went with the breakfast burrito which was a little messy, but hit the spot. Bathrooms were clean and the prices were lower than expected.

Next time I past through Boulder City, I'll be sure to stop at The Coffee Cup."}
{"text":"Nice quaint breakfast spot in Boulder City NV. Worth the trip out from Vegas area for quiet, peace and small hometown feel. GREAT food, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Well let me start with,, I saw it on DDD, and who doesn't love triple D? I ordered the pork Chile Verde omelet..awesome. My wife had the fish taco special, and said it was great. Family loved it, and by the way the waitresses are smokin Hot!. No kidding..a full 6 on the budweiser scale, 6 Clydesdales to get yah off of her!"}
{"text":"went there on Mother's Day and it was only a 45 minute wait. it is in a great location with plenty nearby to walk around and see. the food is great, service is even better. appreciated the healthier fare they had, so it is a place it seems the whole family can enjoy. the coffee is good on its own (without cream/sugar), which I appreciate. cute decor and comfortable, small town feel. oh, and the Bloody Mary had a good kick and flavor."}
{"text":"The staff was incredibly nice.  The cafe was very busy so we took a seat at the counter.  The food was good, flavorful, like a burst of colors in your mouth.  The burrito had a little too much bacon but the pancakes were excellent.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a restaraunt that offers that small town feel where everyone knows everyone and the staff love what they do than this is the place for you!! We LOVE The Coffee Cup and the staff always smiling always very welcoming and the food is amazing!! The place is full of stories, history and fun, so if your looking to leave with a smile on your face and a full belly than make sure to stop and visit!!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast and bloody Mary's ever!! You can't go wrong with this homie little place and the beautiful family that runs it. P. S try the breakfast tacos and the 1,2,3"}
{"text":"Had the chile verde omelet. Very good.  Service was poor but food was worth the trip. Low grade was only for the service issue."}
{"text":"It's your typical small town coffee shop.  The service was quite unfriendly, up until the check was about to be dropped.

The interior is done up in a beach sorta theme.  With a mix of personal affects.

I had the Pork Chili Verde Breakfast Burrito, which was tasty.
I must say that on \"Diners, Drives-In's & Dives\"  Guy Fieri, must exaggerate just a touch.  It was good, but not & I quote \"off the hook.\"

Would I have it again?  If it were served hotter & with more sauce perhaps...

The coffee was terrible.  

I'd go back, if I try Mel's & dislike it even more."}
{"text":"Amazing food & amazing employees! The atmosphere made me feel so peaceful. Would most definitely recommend & return!"}
{"text":"Out of our 4 days in BC, we had breakfast 3 times here. Only reason it wasn't 4/4 is because we didn't try it until day 2 :)

Food is delicious. The cinnamon bun, croissant sandwiches, biscuits and gravy, and omelettes were all super tasty. 

Wait staff is super friendly. Atmosphere is super chill. If I lived near by, I'd be a Sunday morning regular for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and local customers, a real \"old time friendly Mom's Diner\" sort of feeling and ambience. Very reasonable prices, too. Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"It is woeth the drive for the Chili Verde and Bloody Marys.."}
{"text":"Husband & I ordered the world famous pork chili verde omelet, it was DELICIOUS!  Hash browns, homemade toast, & Omelet= 5 stars. The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 star rating is the coffee, I am a coffee snob, it was good but not European gourmet (Lavazza). Great atmosphere, people, and food.  Best meal during our trip, yummy!!! Worth it!!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast. I've been meaning to check this place out for a couple years. I'm not disappointed. Delicious bisquits and gravy. I ate so much food I hurt. But I don't regret it."}
{"text":"This place really lived up to the anticipation.  The Chili Verde omelet was on point and delicious. My daughter had biscuits and gravy and it was delightful as well. I kept eyeballing other peoples meals and there was a rueben sandwich that looked divine. Good service, clean, fun and neat! Will be back"}
{"text":"Peanut butter waffle and bacon bloody Mary! Enough said!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Rocks here!  My two boys ordered the corn beef hash and eggs, my daughter and I split the pork chile verde omelette and it was delicious. My partner got the chicken fried steak (said it was \"just ok\").  I will be back again for breakfast.  Bottom line: friendly and relatively fast service, tasty food, and a variety of choices."}
{"text":"We loved the breakfast and coffee. So happy we stumbled apron this place! The service was great. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Based on recommendations from fellow yelpers we stopped here on a Saturday morning for breakfast. When we went in there was no wait and we were seated right away. We were lucky, there was a 30 minute wait when we left and people standing in the entrance as well as outside.

It's a really cool place with water skis and boating memorabilia all over the place, they also support the military and veterans. We reviewed the menu and placed our orders.  My wife chose the smothered burrito and I chose the papa con chile verde.  We both agreed that anything with their pork chili verde is delicious. Both our meals were fabulous!

The service was great, the food fabulous and the prices very reasonable! Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  Excellent chili verde and awesome service. We went on a Saturday morning and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  The food was fast, hot, and flavorful!  Don't expect a laid back relaxing experience. They get you through there pretty quick.  I will definitely go back when in the area!"}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast place with very friendly staff. Very homey feeling with lots of things to look at on the walls. Food was great.... we suggest the French toast, but it's all really good."}
{"text":"I may not be a local, but I sure feel like it. I work in Boulder City and kept hearing about the Coffee Cup. I found out it was on Food Network, and decided to give it a shot. 

STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND GET THE CHILI VERDE (IF you happen to be in Boulder City and have time to kill. This place can be slow)

I tried the famous Chili Verde. HOLY CRAP. Not too hot, super awesome flavors. Tasted just I was transported to some random street vendor in Mexico. Another level of amazing. Try it!

My boyfriend had the country omelette. I tried it and the sauce was heavenly!"}
{"text":"A must on your way to the Hoover Dam!!  Everything on the menu is amazing, but make sure you finish off with the cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast while driving to Las Vegas and glad I did. Great burrito and friendly staff."}
{"text":"After walking into about four other places on the same street looking for a place with more soda options than coke and sprite, I'm a dr. Pepper/mountain dew drinker, we wondered into this little place. They had both!  So we stayed to eat. Not expecting much, we only ordered burgers and fries. They were delicious!!!  Fries were perfect. Crispy and seasoned perfectly. The burgers were hot and juicy. Buns were lightly toasted. All around just wonderful. Wish we had this little place in our hometown.  If you're in Boulder City eat here!! Very friendly service too!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place. Friendly place it feels like I'm at home on thanksgiving every time I come here."}
{"text":"This spot is so good - very busy on the weekends but worth the wait. Lots of bikers frequent this place and parking can be a bit tricky but there's always a spot to be found around the corner. Their cinnamon rolls are fresh and homemade and the service is really good. As a group, we've had: huevos rancheros, broccoli scramble, bagel sandwich and smothered burrito and something else I can't remember the name - but no complaints from anyone. They now have a bar in the back of the expanded room. Next time will have to try their drinks :)"}
{"text":"So freeking good! Super cool inside. Very friendly staff. I might have to move here from NH."}
{"text":"Per My 9 year old  the place for being uber bus had great service ..the kept asking us if we we ok.. an my food was yummie..so simply said ."}
{"text":"This place has a nice relaxing surfer vibe to it. Aesthetically quite appealing and fitting for a traveler's spot with stickers all over their windows and everything. Even outside there are some neat statues and other artwork along the sidewalks to this spot. Their servers were okay. Greeted by a host first, no wait time, and served quite fast. You pay at the end to the host at the cashier. 

I had the pork chili verde with a side of hash browns and a piece of toast. I also tried their fresh toast. Honestly, it was a let down. From the reviews of this place I thought it'd be amazing.. The hash browns seemed kind of overcooked and my egg wasn't warm enough. The French toast was good though. Portion sizes were really big, enough that I didn't feel hungry for most of the day. Overall it's a decent value meal if you're headed toward the boulder dam but at the same time it honestly is a bit overrated."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to Hoover Dam after reading some good reviews.  It was easy to find, and the service was great.  Laid back atmosphere, good coffee. Portion sizes are really big.  Hubby ordered the Migas and I got an omelette.  Everything was great and it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday morning around 11 after a morning hike, took a couple time to be asked if we were helped. My friend ordered steak and eggs, she loved it! I ordered a tuna melt with French fries! Which I enjoyed much overall food is great! Was drawn the attention by the freshly made cinnamon rolls. Which weren't really \"freshly made\" tasted as if it was just heated up, but still great. The server was pretty nice, but the one thing that totally changed the vibe for me and my friend was that there was this one elderly black man. He seemed as if he needed help with reading the menu, the server provided help he returned the dish thinking he was going to get a sandwich but didn't. Different dish was brought out, then he called for this lady. Blonde hair elderly lady, not sure if she was the food runner or a server but she responded with a rude high tone \"WHAT!\" Me and my friend just looked at each other and that totally changed the vibe for us. I understand it may have been annoying from the mans part, but he was elderly and I believe you do need to have patience dealing with customers especially some elderly people! Overall everything was great but that little issue did change our vibe and just wanted to get out of there."}
{"text":"Popular because of its location off the main drag in Boulder City and because of their appearance on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, you'll likely wait to get a table on a weekend. It's a cool place with a surfing theme throughout. They're known for their Blood Mary's, although I didn't have one. I did, however, have an excellent ribeye steak sandwich ($9.75) overflowing with steak, onions, peppers, and cheese on a soft hoagie roll. The fries were great too -- crispy exteriors surrounding airy interiors. Get here early or prepare to wait, but either way, the food will be plenty satisfying."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for breakfast and am glad I did. When I first walked in and saw a lot of people waiting to be seated, I almost went somewhere else. The waiting area was a bit cramped with people, but it ended up only taking a couple minutes to be seated. They have 2 sides to the restaurant with tables and chairs and there is a counter-top with stools if that's your thing. The servers were friendly and quick to check on tables. The atmosphere is a bit noisy at times, but with almost every table including mine having a Bloody Mary on it, well that can bring on loud conversation and laughter. 

Famous Bloody Mary ($7) - Nice size and really paired nicely with my breakfast. I really liked the taste and the piece of bacon it. What I didn't like was the price tag given I'm in Boulder City and not Vegas. I remember when this same drink was $5 and then a year later it was $6 when I visited however it seems every time an episode of DDD with The Coffee Cup on it airs on Food network (yes Guy's been here...blah) the price goes up even more. I'll stick to coffee next time. 

Short on Change ($5.25) - this comes with one egg, 1 pancake and 2 pieces of bacon. They have Mickey Mouse pancakes on the menu that can be subbed for regular pancakes, just ask and it's no extra charge. The pancake and egg were decent enough and the bacon was really tasty. Affordable and filling!

Home Fries ($2.50) - I asked for a side of home fries and the portion was big. I ended up sharing some with hubby and the home fries were liked by us both. They had a buttery flavor and sometimes crispy yet soft texture that i enjoyed. 

There is a lunch menu with sandwiches and salads. I'd stick to the breakfast menu since it's what they do best here in my opinion and the options are not limited when it comes to breakfast and they have just about something for everyone. Parking can iffy depending on the time of day and The Coffee Cup closes in the early afternoon, so you might want to call and see how late that are open the day you are visiting."}
{"text":"Delicious spot for breakfast. My table had the Cali Omelette, the Huevos Rancheros, and the Short on Cash...all excellent!

Service is fast and the waitresses keep the tables running really smoothly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've been to!!!! Papa Con Chili Verde is where it's at!!! Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"I normally get super excited eating at Triple D's restaurants, but this place kind of let me down. The French toast (which I always eat) really wasn't anything special and the bacon was thick, but cooked too much and was super tough to eat. I love small diners, but this place just didn't hit the mark for me. Wasn't the worst by any means, still had good friendly and fast service. Just not the best I've eaten at."}
{"text":"Classic American diner in the heart of historic Boulder City. Can't say enough great things about The Coffee Cup. The food is outstanding and they have it all. Their specials are off the charts, their classics like corn beef hash and pancakes are excellent. Friendly staff but busy during the weekends."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 Stars...This place was famous even before they featured it on Mr Fieri's show. Expect a long wait, especially on the weekends.....(Thanks Guy!)

ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a fun stop on the way to the Hoover Dam. It feels very down home diner with comfort food and friendly wait staff. 

I got a vegetarian scramble with a side of bacon and a coffee. The scramble was great and the bacon was also. I like the home fries in the scramble quite a bit. Home fries here are cubed breakfast potatoes. The fruit bowl that came with it was fresh. 

The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the coffee, but it was your run of the mill diner coffee so I wasn't expecting too much."}
{"text":"1st time..  friendly!   Big portions.ok food.  Ordered a burrito and chicken fingers and fries.  With coffee and soda under $20.  Worth the visit just for the decor and the funky feel."}
{"text":"We stopped in at the Coffee Cup with some friends who were on their way back to Arizona. Amazing food and great service. I highly recommend the rumzillas (they kind of taste like a boozy orange Julius) and the huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"Horrible filthy rude owner incompetent wait staff.  Weird people lineup to eat here why.  I guess if you are a tattoted biker its ok."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Went twice on our five day vacation. Mixture of locals and tourists. Nice historic downtown area with antique shops etc."}
{"text":"Had such a great breakfast here!  Prices are great and good portion size 
Stopped in before seeing hover dam. 
Highly recommend hash browns they were really good!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars. When my husband said we were going to eat at a place Boulder City I thought I would be disappointed. That was far from reality. I got breakfast (and cinnamon roll), my husband got a chili size burger. Of course I sampled his meal. Everything was delicious. Service was great. 

I have been whining to go back every since! Today I got my wish. Just like the first visit service and food were very good. Even though it is a 50 mile drive (live in Aliante) we will be back."}
{"text":"I'd usually give a 4-5 star rating. The food is great I you can handle a bit of grease, and service once at the table is quick. I consider myself a bacon fanatic- and they have some of the best thick cut bacon ... Always cooked to perfection.

This is where they got docked for 2 stars: 
Service.
We were told 30 minutes. Turned in to over an hour wait. Also- about 5/6 parties of 7 or more that arrived after us were seated well before us. I understand those tables make more money... But 5/6 parties of them is pretty ridiculous especially in a place that small. 

And I don't think we got one \"welcome\" or smile from any staff. Kinda a bummer since I was bringing friends from out of town that I had told about the place. It sucks when I talk a place up and then this happens. 

I know I'll go back. Next time I'll be sure bot to have anywhere to be 3 hours from when I get there because- like today, I'll risk having to scarf my food and not have a good relaxing Sunday morning,"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast and had the green chili verde omelette that was on the \"Diners, drive ins & Dives\" show and it was pretty good and also a good sized portion. We also ordered a chocolate chip waffle which i thought was amazing!!! Ill be getting that again next time. . But this place is great for breakfast if you don't mind a littlw drive out of Vegas. I feel its worth a little drive. Oh and we also ordered the god father burrito which we couldn't even eat cause the omelette and waffle filled us up already. So we took it to go and will be our lunch LOL."}
{"text":"If you're in Boulder City for breakfast, this is the place to be! I don't think anything terrible could come out of this place. My suggestion: Waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. Can I also mention the atmosphere is so cute and quaint! EDIT- Went again last week and ordered the country omelet, totally drool worthy.. their gravy is so good!"}
{"text":"I had yelped this breakfast spot and found out it was on triple d! I was ecstatic, and so my boyfriend and I drove to the coffee cup 10 minutes away from the hacienda hotel. We walked in and were lucky to have one table available. It was very busy with a lot of tourists and regulars. I had a need for scup of chili yes chili at 10 am. It was delicious. The service was nice it was a great happy, energetic atmosphere. We both ordered coffee, and I ordered a number 2, which was a breakfast burrito with bacon, egg, cheese, and hash browns with salsa on the side. It was huge, and it tasted wonderful! I could not finish it so I had the rest to go. Great job coffee cup you satisfied the hunger I had in my stomach!"}
{"text":"Good place. World famous level of good? Not sure. But I'd stop in again if I was here.

Had some general breakfast fare (eggs, bacon, biscuit and gravy) and it was good. Like many other places in this genre, it has a huge menu that's a bit hard to navigate. I got fatigued looking through the menu.

Great service and good prices."}
{"text":"I love these kinds of places. Great breakfast options, casual, local favorite, & not a chain restaurant. Bloody Mary/Mimosa options are a plus and the snarky customer rules are icing on the cake. If you can't take these in jest, I'd recommend you just move along. 

I had a Mimosa to start it off, subbing cranberry for orange juice, and requested a side of limes. If you haven't tried this Mimosa variation, you're missing out!! Their Mimosas are not in a fancy flute, your getting a full 12 oz cocktail for $7. Sweet!!

We ordered the chile verde omelette and I'm sad to say we didn't stop for photos....we gobbled it right up. 

We didn't wait long today but I'd recommend either going early or bring your patience, as long lines may form. 

We'll come back for sure when we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. The place was packed on a Saturday morning which is no surprise but I was introducing the place to a local news anchor friend of mine. She loved it. They serve a great Bloody Mary with a piece of bacon in the drink."}
{"text":"After making my grandparents experience street food from the Slider Truck the night before, I had to take have them with me again for another Yelp first... It was time to visit my first triple D location. I love watching Diners, Drive-INS & Dives and was waiting for an excuse to go try The Coffee Cup in Boulder City and this was my chance. On the way to go show my Grandpa the extremely impressive new bridge over Hoover Dam, I timed it just right to get some lunch here. 

My Mom and I shared the Pork Chili Verde Omelet of course, because that is what was featured on the the show. My Grandma got a BLT and Grandpa, a half Cobb salad. The food came out quickly and I was relieved that we were sharing. Even my Grandpas' half salad was enormous! You can't say you don't get your money's worth here. 

The Pork Chili Verde was pretty tasty, I even asked for a little more for my hash browns. My Grandparents were both satisfied and we all were happy to share Grandmas fries, the seasoning on them is addictive. Overall, it was all pretty good food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a restaurant. Several friends recommended this small coffee shop as we drove through Boulder City on our way to Vegas. Located just off the main highway, it's an amazing restaurant. I had the chicken sandwich, and my husband had the cheese burger. My sandwich was so fresh. You could tell that the chicken was baked that morning. My husband's burger was also delicious. I had a side of potato salad. That too, tasted fresh and homemade. So yummy. The serve was excellent. As an added bonus, I overheard Penn & Teller's cameraman talking about his long time friendship with these famous magicians. So, I one could tell that this place is definitely a local hang-out for Vegas regulars. Don't pass through Boulder City without stopping here for a bite to eat. Totally worth your visit!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, but expect to wait. Our wait was less that 15 minutes. Not too bad. Service was top notch and food was great. If you are in Boulder, this is a must stop.  The chile verde omelette was featured on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives. It was good with a lot of meat. Quite filling."}
{"text":"Whenever my wife and I go out for lunch together I post it on Facebook and entitle it \"Fran And Porter's Excellent Lunch Adventure\". I even call the trip, an episode, but recently, it was \"A very special episode\" as our daughters got to come along. (It's Spring Break).

So before you ask me \"Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis? \"
Let me just explain that I like to have fun. I mean as I write this I notice that over 340 reviews have been added for The Coffee Cup already. There are also over 300 pictures to look at! So before you say \"Holy Repeats Batman!\"  Let's just see if we can have some fun with this.

We traveled from Northern Summerlin of Las Vegas to the heart of Boulder City.  Not exactly \"Space, the Final Frontier\" but it deffinetly further than we usually drive for a meal.

We say The Coffee Cup on an older episode of Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives, ever since I have wanted to try what Guy ate... a Pork Chili Verde Omelette. Now don't get me wrong, the meal was \"DYN-O-MITE !\" but I could have used more of the Pork Chili Verde as part of the meal.   

With my meal I ate over 100 eggs.... Would you believe... 88 Would you believe... 44 Would you believe 14... Would you believe I only ate the Pork Chili Verde Omelette? What can I say? I need a nap afterwards. 

Service was as fine as can be expected, the place was busy! Luckily it wasn't so busy that if someone were to order it, they wouldn't hear the words \"No soup for you!\"

My party of four, two daughters and us parents enjoyed our visit to The Coffee Cup very much. I would certainly suggest any give the place a try, but plan before you go, there will be a wait to get a table or seat.

And that's the way it is...
Good night and good luck!"}
{"text":"We love this place so much. We have been coming for years. Today we had Chelsee as our waitress and she suggested we try the Bacon Turkey wrap.... WOW!!! It's not your normal wrap. The bacon was crispy the avocado was fresh an they serve it with a spicy yogurt sauce which is perfect. I suggest getting it with a side of fruit. So next time in give it a try and ask to sit in Chelsee's section you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"If 'Cheers' were set in a breakfast diner, this would be the place!  The owner mills around in his surf shorts greeting people and generally being friendly.  The walls are covered with photos of locals water skiing, off-roading and doing outdoorsy fun stuff.

AND, this was place was featured on \"Diners, Drive-In's and Dives\" with Guy Fieri - it's gotta be good, right?

Yep, it was good.  Not fabulous, but good home-cooked food served in a friendly, small town atmosphere, with a tiki bar in the back.  And this place closes by 3:00 p.m. so I'm wondering how much business that tiki bar does exactly?  Bloody Mary anyone??

They have a wide assortment of reasonably priced T-shirts as well.  Honey had to have one, of course.  

I love the vibe; love feeling like a local while I'm there; and love the beachy-feeling motif.  When we pass this way again, we'll definitely make a pit stop for breakie."}
{"text":"Typical dive complete with the ditzy waitresses that were hired more for their assets than their skill. The food was average at best I ordered a jalepeno and cheese eggs. Gross when they use crappy pickled jalepenos. Here is a news flash fresh are cheaper and taste better. Hash browns were great if you like burnt and crispy yummm. Now the Chile verde was all verde no chile. I might be wrong but I think they use the same pickled jalepenos for that verde salsa. Weak as it was it could just be canned. The meat in this verde sauce was bland no flavor at all. I should know by now never order mexican food that was recommended by triple D. The server's or local cheer leaders were really nice if you stopped them to request something like forks,a napkin, or water. Owner has to be some middle aged horny frat kid. Look don't make the same mistake I did it's not worth the stop or waste of time. I hop has better food hell even Dennys has better eats."}
{"text":"The charm of this place earns it an extra star. Just the fact that it's a tiny cafe on a tiny street in a tiny town all adds up to charm! Oh, and the food is good too ;) 
Just by the shear number of menu options it's easy to see that breakfast food gets top billing here, and it should. Large portions served on large plates (why serve small portions on a large plate anyway?!), all the waffles, pancakes, eggs served any which way you want and service was good too boot.
We also tried a few other lunch style plates, the fish sandwich is awesome as were the chicken fingers. So if you're in the area of this tiny town, look for the tiny street with this tiny cafe and you should walk away happy, i know I did!"}
{"text":"Place is great. Setting is nice and the food was all very good and home cooked and fresh. More than reasonable prices and staff was very friendly. Go if your near!"}
{"text":"Oh Boulder City... how I love thee, let me count the ways. With much hype and some leftover hair gel from Guy Fieri, I met my lovely former Editor here for some late Saturday breakfast. We had a brief wait for a table and super fast service with a smile! I had the build your own omelet with spinach and Swiss and a side of marbled rye. The meal wasn't mind-blowing but it is one of the only breakfast places in the (near Vegas) vicinity that could handle hash browns they way they do in the East coast. The taters were crispy and delish. I'll be heading back for sure."}
{"text":"Of course, we stopped in on our way back from the Hoover Dam.  It was not very busy and we got seated within a few minutes.  Our waitress was extremely pleasant and very patient while we perused the great menu.  I settled on a grilled ham and cheese that was just about the best I ever had.  My wife ordered a vegetable omelette that she said was delicious (and she is not easy to please).  The iced tea was excellent and the refills were fast.  
We highly recommend the Coffee Cup for its delicious food and its very friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"Boulder City is probably the closest thing Southern Nevada has to my little town in the South Dakota. No outlaws here, but it's quaint and antique, small and genuine. I have been a couple times now and have been satisfied both times with my meal.

Most recently I got, natch, the Dakota Burger. (A note on the naming of the Dakota Burger: I have spent a lot of time in both eastern and western of both Dakotas. Not often is a burger served this way, but if they want to attribute it to us, we will take it). It's a cheeseburger with BBQ sauce and an onion ring on top. Do you like cholesterol? So do I. It's good for you. It makes you skinny and healthy. Dr. Molly says, \"One of these Dakota Burgers daily will make you skinny and healthy.\"

The milkshakes and malts are to-die-for, too. I've also had breakfast and yeah, do your cholesterol a favor and eat here for first meal too because then you'll be even more within my pro recommendations as a doctor."}
{"text":"Oh we're to start !! The mimosas are super !! Not to mention the chile verde on a bed of hash browns! Insanely good ! A must in Vegas area !"}
{"text":"should have gone with the chicken fried steak - a  nearby patron got that delivered, and if the term \"food orgasm\" ever was apropos, that plate was it.  my and kiddo no. 1 got the famous steak sandwich or something ...... it was lacking ..... the meat was OK, but i wish i would have gotten the philly at least.  kiddo no. 2 said BLT was just OK.  4 stars because it's a local place with a lot of heart; too f'n bad we didn't get the chx fried steak!  for the people who say the owners are rude or snobs - they DO have a sign that states \"we reserve the right to refuse service...\" or something like that.  it reminded me of the diner that rock hudson and elizabeth taylor stop in at in the movie GIANT - minus the negative bigotry stuff, of course.  small, local eatery; not touristy and overpriced.  what's the matter with that?"}
{"text":"Heading back from a night in Las Vegas and wanted to find a local breakfast place.  Las Vegas has some good restaurants but no local Mom and Pop places.  Found this place on Yelp, it had good reviews and was on the way home.  It was a really nice local breakfast diner type place.  Very large portions and good food.  We filled our bellies and got back in the road to AZ.  Good value with friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent local restaurant for hearty breakfast or brunch. Omelette portions are huge enough to split + another side. Bacon done to perfection as requested. Friendly/fast service."}
{"text":"Charming breakfast cafe with good food and friendly service.  In a world of chains, it's nice to find unique options.  I had a breakfast sandwich with coffee.  Both were satisfying"}
{"text":"I love these lil diners, normally you can't go wrong.... I did not see the DDD episode, so I found it on my own, unbiased.  Was taking my son to the Day with Thomas train ride event and Yelped the local joints.  This place popped up and looked like exactly what I was hoping for.  Arrived at high noon and there was a wait, but squeezed in on the counter and got right in.  Good selection of items, I always try to find something other than baeggs or steggs (bacon n eggs / steak n eggs).  Huevos Rancheros w/ chili verde?  I'm down!  The plate arrived and it looked as good as it tasted.  I proceeded to wolf down every morsel of chili verde atop crispy corn tortillas, eggs, beans, hasbrowns, no cheese for me.... As I mixed every fork full of o soooo tender goodness, I think 5 minutes went by and my plate was empty, like lick the plate clean.  It was DAT GUD!!  

Take a day trip to Boulder City and check it out!  There's multiple restaurants and bars on the downtown strip that look interesting as well as numerous giftshops  and odds n ends....

Boooooooom!"}
{"text":"We're from San Diego and stopped here while visiting my parents. I'm not into processed food so this is wasn't the place for me. It was hard to find anything fresh and healthy on the menu. I really wanted to like this place but I doubt we'll ever be back."}
{"text":"My family of four stopped here on our way out of town. I wanted to try due to seeing it on DDD. We ordered the 3 things showcased on the show. I had the Pork Verde Omelette....very tasty..would order again. Daughter had Chicken fried steak, gravy, eggs and pancakes. The kids fought over it they liked it so much. The gravy was so yummy. Hubby devoured his Huevos Rancheros, he put so much hot sauce on it I didnt take a bite. We would go back but I think I want to try Mel's because I have heard good things."}
{"text":"We did a tour from Vegas to hover dam with Dean outdoor adventures (BTW - he was terrific, I recommend if your planning a tour while in Vegas) and he brought us here for breakfast.  

The place has really good food, great prices, a full bar (Bloody Mary).  My wife had an omelette and loved it.  My son had pancakes and they were great. I had the plate from diners, drive-ins and dives - would order again( I think it was a Chile verde omelette).  We all shared the biscuits and gravy-loved it!!!!  

If your going to see hover dam this is a must stop for breakfast or lunch.

They get packed so expect to wait, but enjoy a Bloody Mary while sitting on the cool tables outside."}
{"text":"Great yelp find!!!!  We were in the area to visit Hoover Dam and sought out a local breakfast place and found The Coffee Cup!!  Loved the food, cozy (small) atmosphere. A real local place that is good and affordable. Top ratings!!!"}
{"text":"World famous for a reason!! The food here is beyond amazing and soooo huge. We've tried so much on the menu but there really isn't a bad choice!  This is a must visit.  We tried the papa con chile and it was to die for!! The smothered breakfast burrito was another great choice we made that day! This is a must go and go again"}
{"text":"GREATEST PLACE IN THE WORLD! Everyone should go here for any meal anytime of the day! It has tons of cool lake related pictures and articles all over the walls. The service is wonderful along with the staff.  Everyone knows your name and smiles at you.  It is like stepping back into time! Gotta love Boulder City...I go here after riding Bootleg Canyon or hiking the hot spring loop.  All the food is solid!

Try the Bloody Mary...it is off the hook!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. It is well worth the short drive from Vegas. Perfect stop on your way to or from Hoover Dam. I always get the smothered burrito with no beans. They can make it any way you like and are happy to do so. The best part of this and any dish at The Coffee Cup is the pork chili green sauce. It is amazing!! The pork is tender, and the sauce has the perfect level of heat. My advice is to order whatever you like for breakfast on their big menu (omelette, burrito, hash browns) just make sure you get the sauce on it. You will not be sad. The other great thing is their coffee. It is good and hot. Service here is always very friendly. Everyone works together to get the job done and it just makes for a great environment. I will continue to come here every time I am in Vegas as it is my favorite breakfast of all time and that is saying a lot!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast enroute to Boulder Dam.  When I saw the spicy Bloody Mary with the bacon strip in it, had to have one!  Followed that up with the delicious pork chile verde omelette... A big enough meal to last well into the day.  Had counter service, which was attentive and quick.  They seemed to be doing a fine job of turning tables and getting people seated as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Just had a great breakfast at the coffee cup! Cali omelet was amazing and my husband said the chicken fried steak was the best he's had! Definitely be back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"I biked to Boulder City from Equestrian Park in Henderson, so I was ready for a hearty breakfast.  I ordered the pork chili verde.  (note:  I have not seen the DDD show yet.)  

The pork was very tender and was seasoned well.  All the dish needed was some Cholula which was conveniently right in front of me on the counter.  The rye toast was one thick slice, cut in two, and buttered very nicely.  I got the hash browns.  You have the option of getting a short stack instead.  Service was great!

I spoke with the owners son about the surf theme and he was quite a pleasant fellow.  He made everyone who came there feel most wanted.

I got there just about 9 AM and the place got busy quickly and there was a waiting list.  People were waiting outside on the benches for their names to be called.

It was a nice bike ride and a good breakfast.  I'll have to go back and try the waffles some time."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a quick getaway and found this little gem on Yelp. My husband and I are from Phoenix and we loved this place! We both enjoy supporting local businesses. Food was good and everyone was friendly. If I am in the area again, we will def come back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a little kid and it was called Harry's Cafe and they served Chinese Food along with hamburgers. No matter the name, the food is always good and the service is good, too. This Boulder City staple is always busy and parking is at a premium. Whether eating in or taking it home get one of their homemade cinnamon rolls!!!! Delish!!! Situated in downtown BC the Coffee Cup is located next to some lovely antique stores. If you are a tourist to the area this family owned restaurant is a must stop."}
{"text":"Super busy. Just know if you go here on a weekend expect to wait for a table. However the food is worth the wait. 
I got the big Texan (or Texas) omelet with ham, sausage, bacon and chili (come with sour cream too but I didn't get it as I'm not big on it). My omelet was amazingly good. Lots of meat in it and the chili was really good. I got a short stack on the side for .50 more. The pancakes were bigger then my face and super yummy. 
My boyfriend got Papa con chili verde. The pork was perfectly cooked. I can see why this dish is so popular. 
Their coffee was really good too.  
Service even before we got seats was very friendly and had that great small town mom and pop thing. Everyone was working super fast but never seemed rushed or pushy while ordering or refilling your drinks. 
The deco is Cali Americana and laid back. 
We will for sure be back for lunch sometime soon and of course breakfast again too."}
{"text":"This is the best food around here! We were staying in Vegas this week and since we have kids we wanted to see the Hoover Dam and other scenic places. We saw this place has great reviews so we stopped. Love the atmosphere here and the food was amazing! The staff was very kind and even my picky kid loved the food. Will be back next time!"}
{"text":"I grew up coming here for breakfast.  Compared to what the food use to be like, I don't come here anymore.  Ever since they made it on the food network show my favorite meal,  their biscuits and gravey took a dumb.  I keep coming back occasionally to see if their quality in the food has returned, and I always leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place! The breads are baked fresh. Try the cinnamon roll! The chili verde pork omelette is famous for good reason. This place knows how to use green chiles!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the hype has died down or I was just lucky, but I didn't experience the long waits that a lot of people reviewed about.  I've been here 2 other times in the past and admit, the place is always busy, but I have never waited more than 10 minutes.  Maybe it's all about timing or maybe I'm just one lucky dude.  Anyways, what's not to love about the Coffee Cup? 

5 Stars for Service
5 Stars for their Chicken Fried Steak
5 Stars for Portion Size
5 Stars for Price

To me, a place like The Coffee Cup is what I prefer for breakfast. I love these small, family owned breakfast restaurants.  Service has always been top notch, but it's all about the food, right?  I've only been here a total of 3 times and in all 3 times, I've only tried their Chicken Fried Steak.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That's my motto and when it comes to breakfast, this motto is applied. No sense telling you how good their Chicken Fried Steak is.  If that's all I get, then it must be good.  

The Coffee Cup the perfect stop for breakfast, if you're in the area, or heading to and from the Hoover Dam.  I recommend, but you been warned...their Chicken Fried Steak is addicting. 

PS:  Some of the best extra-crispy hash browns too."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Had Cali omelet. My wife had huevos rancheros.  Serve as fast friendly and spot on. We will be back."}
{"text":"Like others, I heard of the Coffee Cup on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and decided to try it out. Once inside the decor is very upbeat, from old license plates in the back, ski's on the walls, water sports pictures all over, and just an overall great casual feeling. When we went there was no line, and we had some okay service. At times I felt like I was bothering the waitress to simply ask for some sugar for my coffee or what not.

With this being said the food was delicious. I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a croissant. The croissant was nicely toasted, and the flavors were great. The meal also came with hash browns, which were golden and delicious.

Overall, great food for a great price! I would recommend it to families and couples that are just looking for a budgeted meal full of amazing flavor."}
{"text":"I'm so sad! I'm so so sad! I just had what is easily the best pancake I've ever had....now I have to wait until I get back to Vegas for another one. 

I came here on my way to Hoover Dam. We looked up places to eat that were outside of the Strip. This place had great reviews so we stopped by on our way. It's a very nondescript location. There's a huge \"we are here\" arrow, but I still couldn't fathom a restaurant was located here. 

Inside it looks like a very old fashioned diner,
Complete with a table that's bent on the middle. No shade. Just ads to the charm. I ordered a California omelet, minus the avocado, with sourdough bread. While sitting there, a boy next to me ordered the pig in a blanket, sausage in a pancake. The package looked so big, and moist and tasty I asked to order one. Just one. It came out before my actual food. 

The pancake was heavenly. I ate it without syrup and without a knife. It was as moist and flavorful as I expected. I loved, loved, loved it. So much so that I didn't eat my actual food. I nibbled it.  The hash browns were meh. The eggs were ok, but the pancake and excellent service made this a winner"}
{"text":"Saw this on Food Network, too -- and was stunned that I'd never heard of it -- this was pre-Yelp.  So our first visit was right after the Nevada Caucus -- they serve lunch til 2 and we raced over from Henderson and just made it.  It was crowded still but folks were beginning to leave so that the last stragglers (us plus about 15 other folks) could be the kitchen's last push.

Basically the menu's the same for breakfast and lunch  -- they've got a few specials on the board -- one of them being the pork chili verde omelette that Guy Fieri tasted on the show -- but I didn't see that until our 2nd visit.  So the 4 of us tried their Chicken Fried Steak (comes with biscuits & sausage gravy, hashed browns, an egg, and believe it or not pancakes - ugh), their Pork Chili Verde b'fast burrito (really really good), their Huevos Rancheros, and their Meatloaf -- we had enough food for 8 people.  

They've got this terrific counter in the front room -- and it's usually filled with locals (I love that).  The owners are a great couple -- and she usually is at the register.  He's a big burly guy who, when he's in the house, is all over the place - visiting with guests, working the floor, taking orders, helping staff.    

Other reviewers complained about the service -- and it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad -- and if the owner knows you, then it tends to be a little better.  

We liked it enough to go back -- and take my husband -- that's when I tried the pork chili verde omelette -- I liked the burrito better, actually.  Mother had the burger this time, and it was a drippy, sloppy, 6 napkin affair and she loved it!  

For us, it's a fun mini-road trip.  We love walking around after lunch (a requirement!), checking out the antique stores, enjoying the weather -- looking at the houses, then if we have time, heading over to Lake Mead.  Boulder City is charming, and the Coffee Cup is fun -- it serves the basics -- but sometimes there's nothing else that can really hit the spot.

Oh yeah, they have a full bar too -- so you can have a killer Bloody Mary with your b'fast, and a beer with your burger if you're so inclined!   

Go eat --"}
{"text":"This place was on food network so I stooped in and had to come back with my wife she had the hamburger and a cup of chili  and loved every bite I had the breakfast and I must say I am not big on breakfast but this palace is changing my mind! They close by like 2:00 so don't waste any time get here fast!"}
{"text":"As a restaurant owner, to eat here is a treat for us. Despite the fact that they are always busy, the service is great, and the food is always good and fast. The atmosphere is fun and they have the best bloody mary's EVER!!! I highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch any day of the week!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here after running a race at Lake Mead. He got the Huevos Rancheros with some has browns and I, the scrambled skillett with a short stack on the side. My toppings of choice were delicious -- the avocado, fresh. the jalapenos, plenitful. the chili, good enough to be eaten on its own. The batter for my pancakes were also very very good as were my toppings -- bananas and chocolate chips. What I had tried of my boyfriend's huevos rancheros was also very good.

My main complain is that it took forever to get the check. And the only reason I minded was that I wanted to get back to my hotel and shower."}
{"text":"All these years in Las Vegas and I have never stopped to eat in Boulder City. So I decided to take my cousin visiting from Atlanta and my dad to lunch on our way back from Nelson, NV. I looked this place up on line. What a wonderful little cafe! Loved it from the minute we walked in. My cousin and I had the BLTA and my dad had the Godfather omelet. The ambiance, food and service were excellent! The coffee was fresh and tasty too. Not sure why they close at 2pm. But I loved it! My cousin bought a bunch of coffee cups too. I will def go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Food was excellent, atmosphere was fun and funky, and the location was superb. We had breakfast, huevos rancheros and an egg potato bacon burrito, both were excellent! And the salsa verde is fantastical! Menu has a large selection of breakfast and lunch items. We will definitely be back!

Note, they close early! 2pm closing time:( and this particular restaurant is a fan favorite of a classy generation of harley groups which were great company!"}
{"text":"Consistently good, The Coffee Cup never disappoints.  Every time we go I get a Bloody Mary and one of their freshly baked cinnamon rolls.  The biscuits and country gravy are amazing as are the hash browns.  The staff here is friendly and the couple who own the place are always there.  I love the surf decor and the homage they give to the Armed Services.  Well worth the traffic if you are visiting, eat a great meal and go see the Damn!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice once on my way into Vegas and once on my way out. The 1st time I had the Heuvos Rancheros with the green chili sauce. I thought this was very well made a tasty. The second time I was in here I was literally blown away. I had the pork chili verdi omelet. WOW. One of the best breakfast I have ever eaten. I would recommend this place coming in or out of Vegas. I would even say make the drive from Vegas just to eat here. It is well worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to the Coffee Cup a few times and I have been both pleased and disappointed.  In the past I have had some gigantic salads with crispy chicken for a great price. A most pleasing couple of visits. My latest visit was the one of disappointment.  Service was awesome but the food was just lacking this time around.  I ordered a mushroom burger.  There was nothing special about it.  The cheese was great but the beef patty seemed pre-formed and potentially frozen.  I don't believe the mushrooms were fresh either.  More like canned.  Normally I wouldn't mind this but The Coffee Cup was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  I would expect more from a place that gets televised world wide recognition.  I've had a better burger across the street at Boulder Dam Brewing.  The fries were good but there were too many for me to eat.  I hate wasting food but I just couldn't do it.  I was with my dad and he loved his Southwest Burger with a side of cole slaw and fries.  He also wanted some chips and salsa which we were told are amazing.  The chips were alright I guess but the salsa didn't do it for me.  I don't know what it was that I didn't like.  Flavor.  Lack of flavor.  It is difficult to put my finger on.  Almost as dificult as trying to fit the big chips into the tiny plastic cups containing the salsa.  Yeah, it was hard to eat it that way.  At least I was with dad for a guys day out.  That made it worth the visit right there."}
{"text":"I've been going for years and love the breakfast.  I reluctantly am providing a two star review based on the lack of cleanliness and seemingly lazy attitude about it.  My wife saw a roach in the women's bathroom on Fri, April 6th.  That same morning I witnessed a waitress take paper money and then immediately go to the bar and put a celery stick in a Bloody Mary drink without washing her hands first then bring it to a customer."}
{"text":"For a good breakfast in Las Vegas, leave Las Vegas and drive up to Boulder City for The Coffee Cup Cafe.

Look at the staff's kid's photos on the walls, look at the license plates those kids probably stole from tourists, and enjoy a cup of simple yet good coffee while you order the world's best omelette.

Slow cooked shredded pork in a mild yet tangy green chili, served up in a huge portion between, around, and smothering a fluffy omelette. I went with a side of toast and some hashbrowns, but do your own thing. The staff is friendly and accommodating of tourists, so have at it."}
{"text":"Super good!! Small quaint. Food was great! We had the green chili breakfast burrito and juevos rancheros. My tortillas were a bit over done, but everything was fresh and super good. I wished they \"served\" you outside, but they do allow you to order to go and then sit out front. We saw people with bloody marys that looked awesome- we had a long drive so we opted for coffee. Nothing special. Definitely somewhere we stop again on a trip to/from Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was amazing! Made you feel like you were one of the locals."}
{"text":"Not to be a hater, but I just don't see the fuss about this place! It was featured on a food network show, thus bestowing foodie cred on a joint that is, in my humble opinion, nothing to write home about.

In its defense, I guess it's famous for its burritos and huevos rancheros...neither of which I tried. I had a veggie omelet (meh...canned olives) with hashbrowns (pretty hard to fuck those up, but they were nothing extraordinary) and toast (impossible to fuck THAT up). 

The service was good and the place has interesting decor...but honestly, if there's a long wait, I personally would just go elsewhere. Plenty o'quaint little cafes in old timey Boulder City."}
{"text":"One of my new fave breakfast stops!!! It is a little bit of a drive from Vegas, but so worth it! Good stop on the way to Hoover Dam.

Boulder City is such a cute little town and has neat shops on the main strip (where Coffee Cup is located). Got there in the am on Saturday and it was a 30 minute wait...not bad for being pretty popular. We went to look at the antique shop next door and they have a great waiting area outside with old boat propellers and surfboards. We walk in and it was smaller than I thought but I like. Don't tell my hubby but host was a hottie!! Had menus at our table and our waitress was super friendly and got our drinks fast. Ordered the Croissant Breakfast sandwich with a slice of ham...holy shmoly. Sooo good. It was cooked perfectly and the ham wasn't too thick so I could actually eat the whole thing!! We ordered a cinammon roll for dessert and that was perfect too. Not too dry or too gooey. Pretty decently priced for 4 people too. We got 2 shirts (cuz they were awesome!!) and paid for our meal and hottie host told us about a car show and we were out.

Such great service, food, ambiance etc. etc. Triple D did it again!! Thanks Guy!!"}
{"text":"Omg best food out here. Traveled to vegas, dropped off wife at casino and I went to get the best food. Was on diners drive ins and drives and the made green chili omelette. Out of this world great."}
{"text":"The best place to eat in Boulder City. Great people, great service, great food, and best drinks!"}
{"text":"It was Memorial Day weekend and we had no idea what to do so-- random thought, \"Let's go to Boulder City!\" and that's just what we did!

My husband remembered a place he heard about on one of the food shows. I was pretty skeptical considering that this place was on tv and few places that we've tried that were on tv weren't as good as they claim them to be but The Coffee Cup surprised us! 

I had a salad that was less than mediocre-- I haven't had a salad w/ iceberg lettuce since high school... But that chili-- it was as Macklemore put it \"This is f'n awesome\"!

Vintage anything is a weakness that I have and they have an antique store right next door, that's where I spent most of my time while we waited to be seated. 

If ever a time that we find ourselves out that way buying a lotto ticket across the dam or we are bored out of our minds and need to get away from Vegas, we'll make a stop here. Enjoy it."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary bar and breakfast!!! I can see why it made the Diners Dives and Drive-ins show!!!! Must go! They even have a healthy menu for those who are on a health kick. Along with everything else under the sun you could possibly crave for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place in Boulder City. I got French toast with coconut and bananas. I also built my own omelet. Everything looked delicious... especially the hot bartender ;)"}
{"text":"Good BLT wirh egg...good pancakes.... sat at counter since didnt want to wait...Great bloody mary served with bacon....my only complaint was the coffee not that good but I am very picky about my cup of joe. Also trying to get one of the many servers  to refill my cup was a hassle. .otherwise I would recommend this place.  There will be a line on the weekends b7tvworth it."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to The Coffee Cup in Boulder City yet, you are missing out! Probably the best breakfast I've ever had, with excellent service at faster-than-fast-food speed, at about fast-food prices. Despite being very busy, the flood of hungry patrons is handled by some of the most efficient hostessing I have ever seen!

Worth the drive to Boulder City, if you're not lucky enough to live nearby.

Highest possible recommendation!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and consistently good breakfast.  The owner acknowledges his guests to ensure the best service.

{"text":"For a place proud of their coffee, it sucked ass. Service was horrible and our server was pretty rude. The rules they have posted are ridiculous, extremely petty. They kicked out the table next to us because they were done eating and apparently people can't relax for a bit and finish their shitty coffee. Food was bland and boring, but it did come out very fast. Only good thing about this place"}
{"text":"This was such a charming breakfast spot that we happened upon on the way to the Hoover Dam. Like most tourists, I found this on a Trip Advisor forum and saw it was a \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" spot, so of course we had to stop in and see if Guy Fieri knew what he was talking about! Happy to say he didn't lead us astray.

On a somewhat sleepy morning, there were plenty of open seats for us to choose from. It looked like a few tables of \"regulars\" and then us, who tried not to look too out of place. Our waitress was quick and friendly, and we ordered up plenty of hot coffee to start. For whatever reason, we decided not to try the recommended pork chili verde. There were just so many great options to choose from, and even though I'm from the Carolinas, it seems odd to order pork for breakfast. Instead, I had the egg white omelette with fruit and my boyfriend had two eggs, scrambled, with bacon, hash browns, and toast. Both were so good and such huge portions! The prices were very reasonable too, especially after being sucked dry by the restaurants on the Strip. We were very impressed and would recommend to anyone who happens to be passing through Boulder City!"}
{"text":"So far my favorite breakfast place in boulder city! Bacon Bloody Mary chilie verde omelet great"}
{"text":"Me and the wife have been here a few times and always pretty good but the wife got a grilled cheese and the bread was toasted but the cheese was still cold not even melted a little bit but i guess they all cant be winners"}
{"text":"Omg I just love this place and always have. 

Let's start with the awesome people who own and operate this establishment. A fine family business and fantastic staff. Always a friendly face helping/serving you. 

The food yummy. The chicken fried steak, the papas con verde, mimosas and bloody Mary's are all to die for. The hangover special and pigs in a blanket are pretty darn good as well. 

The best \"dam\" place for breakfast in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Oh My GOODNESS   we came here about a year ago. I, of course, had the French Toast (because I am still searching for someone to make it like Chick used to in Ogden, Utah).  ANYWAY... My husband ordered the DDD dish \"Pork Chili Verde Omelet\".  He was RAVING about how amazing the chili verde was and MADE me try a bite.  I NEVER have savory for breakfast... NEVER, but I had a bite and said, \"I'm having that next time\".  And I just DID!!!!!!!  I was going to post a picture but I ate it too fast. I think I even finished before my husband finished his.   BEST chili verde I've EVER had. (shhhh... don't tell my grandma Martinez). Actually, she's probably looking down from Heaven saying \"that's the stuff\" .   If you are in the Vegas area, it's WELL worth the drive!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After a trip to Hoover Dam, lunch at the Coffee Cup made the day even more memorable.  The decor is an eclectic mix of license plates, water skis, and old photographs.  The service was terrific - friendly and attentive.  The food was delicious.   Try the pork chile verde on the side of anything you order - it's delicious.  The burgers were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Portions are genorous.  Food always hot and fresh
 Expect a wait on weekends as it is packed.  Interesting decor.  Wait staff  friendly and helpful.   Fries hot and crisp.   All breakfast  entrees ate huge and big enough for 2 people.  Be hungry when you go!"}
{"text":"How I wish I could give this place 10 stars! One of my most memorable experiences while in Nevada, the good is just simply AMAZING!!!!! The chili Verde omelette is to die for!!!! Cannot describe how great this taste, they also have the hash brown with chili Verde, OMG! I would live in this city only to be able to eat here often."}
{"text":"The food was ok and the service was great. However, I definitely think the coffee sucks. I have had better coffee at McDonald's. I ordered a godfather burrito and a different waitress brought me the omelette. Our original waitress came and fixed the order quickly and was super sweet. It's definitely a neat place because of the decor. I recommend this breakfast spot"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for breakfast after hiking at Lake Mead. We made it here around noon on Saturday expecting a long wait for seating. Our wait ended up being less than 10 minutes which was nice. 

We sat at the bar and were greeted quickly. Our cinnamon roll starter and drinks came up quickly. The rest of our food wasn't long after that. The check arrived while we were eating allowing us to cash out as soon as were finished. I liked the efficiency and friendliness of the service.

We started with the Cinnamon Roll. I actually wasn't a huge fan of this since to me it seemed more like a hamburger bun with frosting on top. 

My Huevos Rancheros was crazy good. The corn tortillas were tasty and had the perfect crisp. The rancheros sauce on top was amazing and full of hearty chunks of pork. The salsa and jalapeno on top added great flavor as well. My husband had The Hangover and he loved his meal as well. I tried The Hangover and liked it, but the Huevos Rancheros was where it was at. 

The icing on the cake was the check. Pricing is hilarious for the portions and taste. I'd be here once a week if it was closer to home. For now we'll have to mark this as a must visit when we're at Lake Mead."}
{"text":"It was okay. I purchased a cinnamon roll and what i got was nowhere near what I expected.  It was a cinnamon roll, but, it tasted like a mass produced,  prepackaged pastry. Three bites and threw it out. The rest was fine, service was on point,  quick....maybe I should read the other reviews to determine the tastiest food to acquire."}
{"text":"This charming little cafe was warm and inviting. It's colorful, eclectic charm matched the friendly personalities of the staff working there. Service was fast, with the food fresh, tasty and the portions perfect! I will return to this tasty treat!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy the Coffee Cup! Wonderful food, drinks and service, with a fun, local atmosphere.  Whenever we have out of town guests we make a point to take them to the Coffee Cup, and no one has ever been disappointed.  Also gives an opportunity to wander around the cute town of Boulder City and maybe a stop at the Dam."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else who reviewed this before me I saw it on DDD.

It was on my TO DO List from last year with Mel's Diner so I decided I'd make the drive to Boulder City and do some dining.

I didn't arrive until 12noon but the place was packed and there was a 20-30 minute wait, so.....I headed to Mel's I was toO hungry to wait.

After enjoying a great breakfast I wasn't ready to leave town until I had tried the pork chili verde @ the coffee cup.


This place has surfboards and other memorabilia on the walls and it feels like it should be on Beach St in Santa Cruz.

 I ordered a verde burrito for the road. This place is a little small,cramped and loud anyways.......so food for the road seemed like the best option.

Once I bit into that burrito though I was wishing I had taken a seat so I could order another one.

Damn it was good. I'll be back. i.e. The Terminator."}
{"text":"Warm friendly place full of locals in the morning. This \"old time\" cafe will make anything you want for breakfast.  Sheila is always accommodating."}
{"text":"Very good food. Get the Carne sada  omelet.  Was a good wait to get in but they had a full bar so people seemed happy. Saw a lot of bloody marry's going around. In a little shoppe tourist area of bounder city that I didn't know existed. Ben living here for 4 years or so."}
{"text":"When my family insisted on adding the Hoover Dam to our Vegas trip, I immediately got to researching where to eat on the way (of course).  There really was only one place to go...  The Coffee Cup.  It is Triple D famous.  And I've been to a lot of Guy's places that haven't been that great, but this one is worth the stop for sure.

Yes, you will probably wait.  I strongly recommend going early.  But we were there shortly after opening and still a few minutes wait. Go early!  By the time we left (on a weekday around 9 am), there was a long line.  But it's a friendly line and the town of Boulder City is a charming place to be.  

We ordered French Toast (comes in 1/2 or full order) and omelets (a couple of DIY versions and the Cali Omelet).  Everything was delivered quickly by our super efficient server.  The food was terrific - way above your standard breakfast joint.  Coffee was never more than half full.  And though the place is busy, it didn't feel like it - you could carry on a normal conversation, didn't feel uncomfortably squeezed in between too many people and we didn't feel at all rushed.  

You should absolutely bookmark this for your any off the Strip journey.  Great food and just the right amount of kitsch and sass."}
{"text":"In an effort to get around to place that I've been meaning to check out - I made it out to The Coffee Cup this past weekend with my husband. We were just out visiting Boulder City and Lake Mead, so it was an easy choice.

This place became popular on Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives. The show featured the Chili Verde Omelette, which I got, because YES, why not eat the thing that was featured on the show, eh?

It did not disappoint. The verde was mouth-watering and the pork was succulent. The good thing was the egg was cooked well too. I can see how something like this could become a mess - but it didn't - it worked! The dish comes with potatoes and a choice of toast. 

The only thing I can ding is the fact that I asked to have pancakes instead of toast, and the waitress told me, \"We don't make substitutions.\" So, I said, \"Well that's OK\". I guess it was just a confusion, because I assumed I would be getting toast, and not the pancakes. But when the food arrived - I got a short stack to my surprise. Welp, she just charged me for the short stack, but then skimped me on the toast. Whaaa. Bring me the toast too, why dont'cha?! Especially if I am out-right paying for the short-stack. Oh well. Mis-communication.

You will probably wait in line if it is the weekend. My husband and I did not because we were willing to sit at the counter, but a couple in front of us wanted a table and they did not get seated until we were already halfway through our meal.

I liked this place. I liked the food. A nice little joint with a famous (but also DELICIOUS) meal."}
{"text":"Awesome food, aloha atmosphere, friendly people. 
Great spot when driving to and from Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great little place.  The staff was extremely attentive and quick. I ordered the huevos rancheros with the pan fries.  It comes smothered with the pork ranchero sauce which was very flavorful and fairly spicy.  I was surprised to see green chile this far outside New Mexico.  The corn tortillas were served crispy which is a bit untraditional, but it worked.  We also had the Bloody Mary's which were unfortunately mid par at best.  The presentation was nice being served with a thick slice of perfectly cooked bacon, however the drink tasted as if they were made using store bought drink mix.  Other than the drinks everything else was terrific.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you happen to be passing through Boulder City on your way to The Dam or Lake Mead, you really need to stop in and enjoy a meal at the World Famous Coffee Cup. 

Last weekend, my wife was competing in a Triathlon, and myself (The Official Las Vegas Tri-Club TAILGATER) and some very good friends went out to BC to support her... she did great by the way! After the Tri, we figured it would be a good to refuel at the Coffee Cup.

Because of the event, it was packed! Considering we had a group of seven, and the place is tiny, we thought the wait would have been 45min or so... Not true. They had us in there and seated within 20min. Very impressive. 

The Coffee Cup is a cool local spot that is decked out in Retro 60's/70's SOCAL surfer garb. Old surf boards... water skis... and pictures of dune buggies and family outings plaster the walls. 

The food was wonderful. I'm pretty sure all of us ordered Breakfast, and I ordered the Board Walk Breakfast Sandwich. I couldn't have been happier with the meal! Everyone else would probably agree, since there were no complaints and a lot of eating goin on... Considering this place made it on to The Foodnetwork (http://www.foodnetwork.com/diners-drive-ins-and-dives/breakfast/index.html), I wouldn't expect anything but quality.

The service was great! Our server was very friendly, prompt, and poured a great cup of coffee. The owners seated our large group and they even came around to our table to make sure everything was the way we wanted it...

The prices were very reasonable for both Breakfast and Lunch. If you go to their website, you can view the menu and prices (http://www.worldfamouscoffeecup.com/). In my opinion, the only thing keeping it from a Five Star rating, were the small dingy bathrooms :(

Boulder City is a very unique little town on the outskirts of a CRAZY city, and the Coffee Cup really fits in well there. Stop by and enjoy the food and decor! You won't be disappointed...
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Very short wait for great food and coffee. Many menu choices will please everyone in your group. The shortstack is a meal in itself. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Every time I'm in Las Vegas I stop at the Coffee Cup. It's so refreshing to step off the strip away from the pretentious chain food that is doubly priced for the simple fact that it has some chef's name attached to the building.

Our food is always really, really good here. My 16 year old son said it was the best waffle he's ever had. Best fish tacos I havd ever had, and it's one menu item that I am always looking for the next best one. 

The staff is pleasant, friendly, and on point. One indicator for me is how well the wait staff can keep up with refilling my wife's water or iced tea, which she drinks like she's just walked from Phoenix to Vegas in 110 degree weather. Her glass would barely hit the table empty before an employee would appear with a refill. 

I always look forward to a meal at The Coffee Cup."}
{"text":"Great choice for a family breakfast. I had relatives in from Austin last week. Rumors at a nail salon said this was a great place to eat . They were right.?"}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome. First of all it's always busy however it doesn't seem like you have to wait that long.  Of the times I've been there I've always had the peanut butter pancakes.  It's a simple concept but a good one. They take an awesome pancake batter and sprinkle peanut butter chips inside. And it's excellent with butter and syrup.  It's really a must try. Not to take anything away from the coffee cup but I have made these at home on my own and they are excellent but there is something about having them in boulder city at the coffee cup."}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast on the weekend.  Always busy and usually has a wait to get seated.  The huevos rancheros are bomb and made me a convert (I don't usually order south of the border breakfasts).  Total diner vibe meets surf/ski bum motif.  Oh, and the pigs in a blanket are very good too.  The pancake batter must be laced with powdered sugar because it has an almost elephant ear taste to it."}
{"text":"It's difficult to get up late in Vegas to have to be Henderson, NV somewhere and not think about getting breakfast until you hit the boonies.  We were getting desperate to find a breakfast spot.  Desperate enough to stop at a McDonald's (yikes!).  I drove and my husband Yelped.  Yelped, Yelped, Yelped until we found \"The Coffee Cup\".  It looked pretty legit so we gambled on the exit, headed for their door and had our name down for a table. 

I had the \"Short on Cash\" with a side of hashbrowns.  Loved it.  I like my pancakes a bit toasted.  The bacon was fantastic as well.  Just wished their eggs were a little larger so I didn't have to order a side of one.  

Tried my husband's California Omelette and it wasn't too bad either.  Unfortunately, the hot chocolate was watered down and we barely saw our server again.  I hate having to have to flag down another server for a different table just so we could get more napkins and butter.  

The decor had a very \"homey\" feel to it: random skis from each decade adorned the walls; surfboards and portraits of people on jet skis and wakeboards.  I get it, people here love their watersports on (I'm guessing) Lake Mead.  

If we're ever here again, I'd stop in for my \"Short on Cash\".  Ohh and don't forget to check out that cute antique shop next door!"}
{"text":"When we were at a CVS in Henderson we asked the cashier to point us to a good breakfast place... He said that there weren't any (lol).  We told him we were going to Hoover Dam and he said with that being the case we should get  breakfast in Boulder City.   He couldn't remember the name of the place but he said it was on some  Food network show and it was on the main drag.   With a little help from Yelp and Urbanspoon we assumed it might be the Coffee Cup--we were right.   

Picture a busy diner that does everything exactly right (for a diner)   Picture a diner with a  super nice staff!   Picture a diner with a full bar!!!!   This place is a bit of a dive in the BEST way!!!    Yes, dives can be a fun.   It is not a \"greasy spoon\"  the food was well cooked.     I had a scramble and my wife their \"small\" budget breakfast, she liked it.   My scramble was great and the hash browns were perfect, a little crispy just the way that I enjoy them.

They had a strong Bloody Mary which in it's own right would be a six on my 1-10 scale.... BUT....    With a piece of crisp bacon sticking out of it, it becomes an 11!!!    

I talked with the owner and asked if that was their original idea...   she said her husband  came up with it.      Some day when  bars all across the country are putting bacon in their Bloodies, I hope this guy gets credit.   (my friend invented beer pong and nobody seems to believe him).   I already have a friend in SB who is going to steal it for his bar and we told him to call it the Boulder City Bloody.... maybe that will catch on."}
{"text":"The wait can be long, but it is well worth it. Everything I've tried from the menu has been great. I especially love their omelettes and scrambles. 

The feel of the restaurant is very inviting and the service is great as well. The surrounding area is charming and there's even a few antique stores nearby to wander in while eating. The Coffee Cup is a must in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Bacon and eggs. The bacon is cut thick and cooked just right. Eggs are eggs. Hard to make them wrong. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was right down in the old part of town with all the eclectic shops and sculptures.  The decor seemed to be college town style with fun Route 66 stuff as well as movie quotes on the wall and photos of visitors from Lake Mead.

The staff was friendly and prompt.  They checked back with us often and made sure we were happy.  I had breakfast and chose a healthy egg white omelet with a side of fruit.  It tasted very good and hit the spot.

They were busy but kept up with everything.  They had some yummy looking specials for breakfast and lunch each day of the week.  The price was right as well.  If I get a chance, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good food from scratch, good service with a smile then you must visit The Coffee Cup Restaurant!
We were greeted with a friendly smile and chose to sit at the counter. 
The regular patrons were friendly and gave us delicious recommendations for breakfast.
We tried the house specialty which was the pork chili Verde omelet. Just the right spice and loads of delicious flavor.  We also tried the boardwalk breakfast sandwich. Grilled sourdough with scrambled eggs with Swiss cheese and I also added fresh avocado. Wonderful for something different.
We both had coffee and it was nice and hot and no bitterness.
The next time we come back through Boulder City we will definitely visit again and try other delicious items on their menu!  
One more thing, we admired their wall dedicated to our veterans especially the 23 year old who was killed in action in a rescue attempt of other U.S. soldiers."}
{"text":"When a mom & pop restaurant serves delicious food with a smile, I-Hop (sic) there for breakfast. The Coffee Cup is the quintessential mom & pop breakfast eatery in historic Boulder City.

  The Coffee Cup sits in the heart of the historic Boulder City district where it's Main Street: Nevada meets Arizona Street. It is in a historic building that compliments the surrounding antique shops, restaurants, and businesses. 

 Boulder City is the gateway to adventures that range from a hike up a red mountain, to Hoover Dam, and into Arizona. Three times before setting out on adventures, I fueled up in The Coffee Cup. All three times, I visited on a Saturday morning. And all three times, the place was very busy. It was popularity where demand exceeded supply. The wait for a table would be from 20 to 40 minutes. Instead of waiting, when a stool became available, I'd make a beeline to it. If I was in a party of two or more people, I'd have to wait. But if I was impatient or anxious to set out on an adventure, I could walk to Mel's Diner or into the Boulder Dam's Restaurant for a quality Boulder City breakfast. Now, if I chose to wait, I could hang out outside taking in the historic Boulder City scenery with architecture dating back to the 1930s. Or, I could make a left by the hostess into a bar that serves a popular Bloody Mary served with a piece of bacon. Carissa. C presents an excellent description of the Bloody Mary in her review.

   A few minutes after sitting at the counter, a friendly server was there pouring my tasteful coffee and water. Up to the conclusion of breakfast when the server asked if I wanted my last refill in a to-go cup, she was on top of refills. 

 When I wasn't looking at the menu or my smartphone,  I'd take in the Bohemian interior with the licence plates and surfboards. For a restaurant in the Mojave Desert, this theme isn't really out of the ordinary. Boulder City is also the gateway to Lake Mead and its Boulder Beach is a Margaritaville in the Desert.

  The Coffee Cup isn't really a diner in the sense that it closes at 2 pm. Their specialty is breakfast and a Bloody Mary. This review is testimony to the delicious breakfast that the Coffee Cup serves. Their bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado on sourdough bread with fries is delicious. They serve it with a generous portion of bacon that is far superior to the Boulder Dam Hotel's restaurant a few hundred feet down Arizona Street. I have also enjoyed their Short on Cash which is large on quality. It includes a large pancake with butter (syrup is on the counter), an egg (I chose scrambled), and two bacon strips. The pancake took up 70 percent of the clean plate with the remaining 30 percent divided equally between the egg and bacon.

  I see Boulder City as the gateway to hiking adventures in my future. And I see myself hopping into the Coffee Cup for a tasty breakfast at a reasonable price served with a smile."}
{"text":"If you haven't been yet.... GO!! Amazing breakfasts!! Pork Verde is incredible and the coffee is fresh!!"}
{"text":"Another awesome DDD recommendation. Stopped here on our way to Sedona from Las Vegas. The place was super crowded but well worth the wait. The staff is super friendly, the food is great, the portions are huge, and the coffee hits the spot. 

Big fan of the pork chili verde. Add some hashbrowns, a huge piece of toast, and it really doesn't get much better. And if somehow you're still hungry, venture for one of their cinnamon buns. The only thing you'll regret is the calories."}
{"text":"If you've never been, go.  Even if you don't like \"soul food\", go.  The food is good, the food is fresh, the service is excellent, and it's served up fast and hot.  The only downside is that it can get a bit pricey.  Not crazy pricey like some places, but it's not your typical soul food place either.

It's a large amount of food for a fair price, but it's going to put a small dent in your wallet at the same time.  That said, you should still go.  And if you're there for breakfast, try the Chicken and Waffles.  Seriously.

{"text":"My wife and I discovered this wonderful little restaurant on our return from a Hoover Dam visit. LOVED the green chile omelette! Perfect and unique blend of pork and chiles...perhaps the best omelette I've ever had. Wonderful Bloody Mary as well!"}
{"text":"This cute and cozy place is worth the drive from Las Vegas.  You'll really get the small town feel while in Boulder City.  Especially the genuine faces when you come into The Coffee Cup.  

It's always a great start to my Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"An overall great experience. We saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and decided to go check it out since we were in Vegas. My navigation system led us easily and boy was it cold outside!!! We went in and recognized the daughter and Joe the chef. The daughter was extremely friendly and the food was excellent. The Chile Verde was very tender and flavorful, and the corned beef hash was to die for. Everything was excellent, service, food, ambiance, and atmosphere and we enjoyed our time there."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot... Great food... Well worth the drive and the wait... Ate the world famous chili verde omelet... And omg! With every bite I took my mouth watered."}
{"text":"A great find when you need a little getaway outside of the city. Quaint, friendly, yummy, and inexpensive! Service was good, as were the mimosas. My mom and I shared a Cali omelette and a waffle with fruit. All was good. The men enjoyed the house special chili verde omelette. If they had turkey bacon on the menu, I might even call them... The perfect breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This was our second visit.  Great time with our friends.  It was 10:00 am on a Saturday and we only waited about 10 minutes for a table for 6. 

Great food, great fast service and a wonderful atmosphere.  I was also impressed with the low prices.  

This is a \"must stop\" in Boulder City."}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast spot. It has a small town diner type feel. 

Service was quick and friendly. I ordered the build your own omelette with egg whites, spinach, mushrooms, and cheese. I also added a short stack in place of hash browns. 

The omelette was generously portioned and the short stack was huge. 

All the food was delicious. I think I found my new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on the way to the Hoover Dam.   Yummy breakfast.  It will definitely fuel your day."}
{"text":"Hidden gem en route to the Hoover Dam, on a charming, retro main street harkening back to the city's origins as a town built to house the dam workers and their dam families. 

Coffee Cup Cafe is pure surfer kitsch complete with Tiki Bar decor and pics of celebrity surfers/boarders. Teeming with locals and local charm, the CCC also serves up fabulous grub that will cure any Vegas hangover (or in our case, Vegas delayed flight layovers). 

All standard breakfast fare was excellent, with the Food Network standout Pork Chili Verde omelette earning its kudos. 

Great atmosphere, delicious and generously-portioned breakfasts, and friendly service make The Coffee Cup Cafe well worth the 15-minute drive off the beaten Strip."}
{"text":"We live in Henderson not too far from Boulder City and love to come out here for Breakfast. The Chili Verde omelet is to die for. Prices are great, portion sizes are HUGE! My family and I love this place and are so glad that it is close enough to enjoy. If you are looking for a breakfast or lunch spot you have got to try The Coffee Cup!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!! Great customer service as soon as we walked in. We placed our order and it came out within the next 10 or less, very fast service! With the food coming out so quick, it made me a little concerned if it was going to be good, but on the contrary, I was very surprised! The food was delicious! I will definitely go there again, it is worth the 30 min drive from Vegas. Highly recommend this place."}

This place was featured on Triple D, im planning on eating at more triple locations.

I had the steak and eggs, which was fabulous. And a great price point. When you go you must get a cinnamon roll.  Yummm"}
{"text":"A good place for breakfast, it is usually pretty crowded since it was on the Foodnetwork once and so it still has residual fame.  The fame is well deserved though. The portions are big and the prices cheap, the best combo.  I enjoy the burritos, good filing and size. The atmosphere is very homey if a little dirty but still a good place to go for a late breakfast."}
{"text":"We stopped here again while in Nevada, in fact we drove 45 minutes out of our way to eat here! Got the Peanut Butter and Pecan Waffle again and tried the Meat Loaf Breakfast for the first time. Both were just ever so TASTY! We sent a picture of our food to a friend in Ohio who loves this place, he asked us to bring him a coffee cup back :) we did!

The only downfall this visit was the service was just a little slow but nothing that alters my high opinion of the place!"}
{"text":"Didn't get to try the food. We were told there was a 15 minute wait. After waiting 35 minutes we checked and were told that we were next. Seeing several tables open we asked if we would be sat at one of them and were told no they save them for larger groups. If you are a party of 2 you will only be sat at the counter. We left and are now enjoying a hearty breakfast at the boat house cafe. Wonderful service with a beautiful view!"}

Fresh - hearty - not too heavy - great service - clean but with diner type feel and the best waitresses around. I love the 123 which has eggs, bacon and a gravy biscuit. Fresh biscuit and real gravy that is light and a little tangy. Weekend treat is French toast - big, light and awesome. Have not done lunch yet but soon. Also can't beat the BC old town vibe. You will be sitting by uber rich on one side and Hells Angel on the other all united by awesome food."}
{"text":"The Coffee Cup continues to be my FAVORITE weekend breakfast location!!  Everytime one of my family members or friends from out of town visit me in Nevada, I make it a point to introduce them to this amazing place!!  I work in property management and with every new resident that asks about great places to visit, I tell them about how wonderful the food and service are!!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE



I had the classic breakfast burrito with no bacon (I gave up meat) and it was huge and glorious! Small little joint but such a family feeling. Wonderful service. My husband ordered The Godfather burrito and he pretty much drooled all over the place. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Yummy!!  We loved every bite.  Delicious.  We had to check it out when we saw it was on the list of Diners, Drive Ins and Dives.   Very satisfied. Great coffee. Great service. Worth the drive from a Henderson"}
{"text":"I first became aware of The Coffee Cup long before I moved to Boulder City.  Like many people, I saw it on Diners Drive Ins & Dives. 
One of the first places I ate at when I came to Boulder City.
Have been there several times since.  Food is decent and plentiful. Prices are typical diner prices.  The place is always packed for breakfast.  Great spot to run into neighbors and friends.
The service can be a little inconsistent though.  Last time I was there, I have to say that the server was a little cranky & inattentive.  But everybody has their days. So I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"Met some friends here on a Sunday morning around brunch time - We were headed to Vegas and they drove in from Laughlin.

Super cute place situated right next to an antique shop and old time ice cream shop. I want to pinch this town's cheeks I love the cuteness of everything. 

The place seemed to really whip through the wait pretty quickly. (Be sure your whole party is present as they will not seat incompletes. Fair enough, because the place is popular!)

Our friends both ordered their signature bloody mary that is served with a strip of bacon. YUM!

Since we were about to embark on a three day stint in Vegas, I opted for iced tea and my husband stuck with soda.

I had the Dakota burger, hubby had the Eggs Your Way, friends had the Chili Verde breakfast and the Smothered Burrito.

Food came out quickly, hot, and delicious! Server was super nice too. I loved the small town feel of the place. 

This will definitely become a staple stop for each trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ok this was a great local real food breakfast place w excellent choices. Pecan waffle and huevos rancheros in a charming historical town worth wandering around."}
{"text":"It was defintely a fun stop to make in Boulder City.  The Pork Verde Omlette was pretty good as everyone mentioned but I wouldn't say it was out of this world.

They advetised $5 Bloody Marys and I gave it a shot.  I was disappointed in the quality but I guess it was wroth $5.   It had huge chunks of horseradish in it and I love the spice...but it was even too much for me.

Also, the service here was excellent.  No....SUPER excellent.  They were all friendly, helpful and fast.

Also, it was abnormally clean for a \"dive\".  ;)  Very shiny in fact."}
{"text":"Don't order a full salad unless you have all day to spend eating it! Great food, nice staff, will return next trip!"}
{"text":"Papas con chili verde has a kick; it may not be much to look at; but, it is worth it."}
{"text":"2nd time here and it is the best brkfast place I've ever had. Love it. :) I will be bk"}
{"text":"Just tried to finish my amazing Smothered Burrito at the Coffee Cup. Have never had better breakfast burrito. You can see I didn't succeed, so it looks like I'll have an amazing lunch too."}
{"text":"Love the food, great family run business,
EVERYONE  is friendly! But the last 3 times we've gone, we live in Henderson, prices have increased by 50 cents per item on the food, and bloody marys are now $8...(overpriced). That's Strip prices...come on, you're in Boulder City....put prices back where they belong...people notice these things....not worth the extra trip..."}
{"text":"Excellent funky coffee shop. Super busy on weekends. Very good food. And the best Bloody Mary around"}
{"text":"As Boulder City residents, we visit Coffee Cup at least once a week. We never mind the wait on the weekend because the food and service are well worth it. Anything with pork chili verde is a must. My favorite is the pacific burrito smothered in pork chili verde. Their bloody Mary's are hands down the best I've ever had. No, they don't have a cornucopia of toppings; a simple piece of bacon, olive, lime and celery are all it needs. When my family and I visit, it feels like home."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for breakfast! I received really fast and friendly service. The food came out promptly and everything tasted pretty good. As a starter, I ordered the cinnamon roll. This came out warm and fresh and I was surprised by the size. This is big enough to share with at least 1 more person.  

I also ordered the huevos rancheros and thought it tasted really fresh. The only thing is that I was a bit thrown off because I believe the menu says that this dish comes with corn tortillas. The reality is that this dish comes with two tostadas. This was totally fine with me and I ended up really enjoying the flavors. 

This is a place I intend to bring my hubby. His favorite food is breakfast food and I just know that he will also like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice little diner in a quaint area of Boulder City.  This is a very historical city, as it was created specifically for the workers building Hoover Dam. At least that's what I heard.  So I was looking forward to eating here in this city, and for the purpose of it being a Triple D location.
Got there on a Friday morning and sat on a bar stool. Lots of locals. Waitresses were very nice and tended to me immediately.  I ordered a Cali Omelette.  Filled with the usual items in this type of omelette, various veggies.  It was okay, nothing special.  Typical of a veggie omelette.  Not sure what I was expecting, but I could get this anywhere. Potatoes were pretty good.
What I really liked was the ambiance of the place, with lots of various items covering the walls and ceiling.  License plates, surf boards, etc.  Great place visually.

It is located on a strip of street that has a number of other cute stores.  Great to take a stroll.
I am glad I stopped.  But the locals probably appreciate it more than an out of towner."}
{"text":"I probably don't need to review this place.  When you've been on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, you don't need help getting bodies in the door.  But, we come here consistently, despite the fact it's about 25 minutes (or more depending on traffic) from our house.  The peanut butter pancakes are the best pancakes I've eaten.  Loaded with peanut butter flavor, they are fantastic.  They are worth the trip down to Boulder City alone.  

My wife typically gets the short on cash, a smaller breakfast that is a solid bargain.  I order an omelet, breakfast burrito, whatever I'm in the mood for.  They have simple but solid home fries, with a little bit of seasoning and some onions.  I get them extra done for more crisp.  Be advised, there is not much of an area to wait inside, so you usually end up waiting outside.  And, there are several tables outside, so people sit down and smoke right by the door.  This is of course annoying if you aren't a smoker (we aren't).  So, we usually take a walk and wait further away from the door if this is going on, which it usually is.  

Service is solid and they usually get to you decently quick.  This place is definitely worth a drive down to Boulder."}
{"text":"Had to try the Huevos Ranchero and Cali  omlett. Too funny, when I ordered I asked about putting green chili sauce on the Heuvos. The waitress was trying to explain the sauce. I just wanted green sauce, couldn't understand the problem. Then...she brought out a sample of the two sauces, I get it now! She even laughed and said I looked at her like she had 2 heads. But she was absolutely correct. Both sauces are very similar but yet very different. Both if our breakfast was outstanding."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Juevos rancheros are delicious! Also, the best Bloody Mary I've ever had (has a bacon strip in it)! Delightful decor and service."}
{"text":"Amazing small town diner, my hubby and I are locals and we come here all the time. The food is excellent, wait staff is friendly, fast and always smiling and the owners take the restaurant  business seriously. It's definitely a hit with any Boulder City resident I know and it my favorite place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, family owned and operated, it can't be beat. Come early and prepare to wait a few minutes. But don't worry, it's totally worth it, the Coffee Cup lives up to everything you've heard or read about!"}
{"text":"We were told to come here for breakfast on the way to Hoover Dam and boy are we glad we did. The food was amazing. Fresh, hot, tasty. My wife got the Short on Cash and I got Huevos Rancheros. The best I have ever had. The Huevos is a must order. My wife loved the pancake and the bacon and egg. She especially loved the Bloody Mary. The staff were very friendly. If I had to crawl to get here I would."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Staff and regulars were super friendly and informative."}
{"text":"My rating is misleading. We stopped at the beautiful establishment. We did not get any coffee. However, they allow UNLV students to play jazz on Sundays. It was great.

We would have stayed if situations were different. I suggest you try this place. If we come back, I would like to stay for a while and enjoy the Tea Shop (well, my wife would like it) and enjoy a cup of joe and listen to the jazz.  This might be a hidden gem.

Again, the rating is a bit off but I couldn't give them a 5...I'd like to but that would be an inaccurate assessment."}
{"text":"So this is a place that was on DDD and the food was fairly good. But not unreal and for some reason after seeing really good service at the other tables for the locals. I was really disappointed by that."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this place by all people my husband! He took me here on our third or fourth date. I've always enjoyed this place ever since. So when one of my friends wanted to go to breakfast for her birthday she said she wanted to go to a place in Boulder City, but didn't know the name. I knew she was talking about the Coffee Cup! 

The Coffee Cup has a breakfast and lunch menu that they serve all day, but they are only open till 2pm. If you order from either side its ALL yummy!

 Today I ordered the Downtown Omelet with fruit on the side. The eggs were not over cooked at all and it was full on bacon, onions and tomatoes. Very tasty! The fruit was perfect too. Nice that they have a no pineapple option when it comes to fruit. 
My friend ordered the same as me, but no onions and instead spinach. She also had  the short stack of pancakes on the side. They were huge! A lot bigger then I expected a half stack to be. Her husband ordered off the lunch menu and got the Brisket sandwich with coleslaw and fries. He said the sauce was tasty and the meat not tough at all. 

The service is excellent at the Coffee Cup they kept our coffee cups full and were very nice about substitutions. If you come on a weekend be prepared to wait a bit, but it's totally worth it. I'll for sure be back again soon! The Coffee Cup never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I had a business breakfast meeting with my associate the service food coffee 
all were \"on\" the morning we were there .. Pork Chile Verde Omelette .. My associate 
owns a tatt shop in the bay area and really this sent him right over the moon  ! Ya know ?
Ever been out at a restaurant and the company your with orders what you wished you had  ? 
No worries the homemade corned beef hash the thick crispy bacon with over easy was really great and appeased our man's man appetites along with the coffee which was other wordly ( Colorado Coffee Roasters I think one of our servers explained )  all due respect to the very eye pleasing service we received from the dreamy female staff whom were courteous kind and were around our table in waves with polite professional service ..  Ooommgawa  !!!  Me go back .."}
{"text":"We were in Boulder City with family from of town to see the Hoover Dam and decided to stop into this place. We all watch Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives and thought it would be fun to stop in to this place that was on the show. The restaurant is a very cool place overall, the staff was very friendly took all six of us to our table at around 1:30 when they close at 2:00 without any fuss. The wait staff was super friendly. I got the patty melt, my wife a grilled ham and cheese, our kids got a waffle and a grilled cheese, and the rest got a chili dog and meat loaf. My patty melt was good, it wasn't gourmet, but I did not expect it to be. The kids enjoyed their food and my wife really liked her grilled ham and cheese. My mother-in-law said the meat loaf was very good and enjoyed the mashed potatoes. My father-in-law like the chili dog, but the chili was quite spicy and he was not very much of a fan. But, overall it was a neat experience. The give this place a three stars because the food is not perfect, but it is good. The ambiance is pretty cool though. It is definitely worth a visit. On a side note, the coffee was very good, but it should be considering their name."}
{"text":"The bloody mary I ingested was absolutely gross.  However, it got the job done right, so I figured I'd be fair and write a review.

Huevos Rancheros...freaking awesome.  It was DELICIOUS.  I loved it, but my husband ordered it, so I didn't get to eat it all.  But I did steal quite a few bites.  I ordered the patty melt, and it was also delicious.  Marbled rye, cheeeese and onions.  Onions were so good.  I won't make a choice on their pancakes based on my dislike of them before going there.  But they were pretty average, so says the husband.

It does have surfer/personal feel inside, and the people themselves seemed like good people, just not the kind that wanted to strike up small chatter when it was busy.  No complaints on the service, other than we had to scrounge up our own menus, but that's not awful.

When I started writing this, I was giving it a 3 star, but I think I'll bump it to a 4 based on the only really gross thing was the bloody mary.  Food was good, bloody mary was not."}
{"text":"For a place that calls themselves the Coffee Cup they've got to get some better coffee. It's not the worst but definitely not the best. Kitschy decor and friendly service is what you'll get here. The country fried steak was huge! The chili verde omelet was ok. I expected more flavor. It was missing something. I didn't receive too much meat either. Mostly hash browns and sauce. French toast was delicious tho. I tried to trade my Grandma for my chili verde and she wouldn't budge but she shared so it's all good. Guy Fieri put this place on the map but it's always been a local favorite way before the show. Just expect a wait if you don't come at the crack of dawn with limited seating in a small town this place gets packed!"}
{"text":"Sundays? Be prepared to wait. From the time we got our name on the list, to get to seated, took our orders and to the time the food actually landed on the table ready to eat was 2 hours. Way too many people for me trying to jockey for position through the front door. I mean, i get it. Its been featured on triple D so i suppose we will have to try it on a saturday or some other week day. The food was as expected and the service was good, just dont be in a hurry. There are plenty of covered tables outside to wait but they happen to belong to competing restaurants."}
{"text":"We went here while on a family vacation this year. I can't recommend this place enough. The food was fantastic, the service was super friendly and helpful. Next time we're on the area we are for sure going back for a fantastic breakfast. I Highly recommend The Coffee Cup."}
{"text":"This is a great trip to take! My husband and I saw this on Triple D, and we were not disappointed. We went there on a Sunday morning, and waited about 25 minutes. The pork chili verde that they make is DELICIOUS! We had huevos rancheros smothered with the chili verde. The service was good and prompt. This place has been around for years, so it's not a high end diner. It's a very casual setting with great breakfast food. A must go to place if you're anywhere near Boulder City."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place Ever!! Homemade, yummy, soooo damn Good over all

Love 
Love 
Love"}
{"text":"Food was delicious...service wasn't so great. We went on a Sunday around 11:30 and the place was full but that doesn't mean you can ignore your customers. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had seen moving to Las Vegas. This restaurant reminds you of the classic east coast diners. The atmosphere is great and the prices are more than reasonable. We definitely will be making excuses to come all the way out here again asap."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast. The food and service were spectacular!"}
{"text":"Worth the drive to Boulder City.  Good service, very attentive and very good food. We ordered the Breakfast Burrito was was very tasty and a nice big portion.  I would recommend The Coffee Cup to everyone who wants to wonder out to Boulder City for the day."}
{"text":"Love this place best bloody Mary's arround.. They have the best breakfast as well. Great home town feel and great food don't even bother going anywhere else you would just be throwing your money away.."}
{"text":"Love the coffee cup, been going there for years. When I was 18 we used to go to breakfast every Saturday before going to make mead. 
Great food. Good service.  Friendly people."}
{"text":"Had the 3cheese burger and mushroom yesterday and tasted fantastic! It was packed when we were there at 11Am and it was Monday, wonder how the shop gets crazy on the weekend. Love the ambiance of this little shop. Worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Went there while visiting friends. Had to go because of the Guy Fieri reccommendation. The chili verde omelette was good but service was not so good. Waitress forgot drink order and we didn't get out mimosa and bloody Mary until after food got to table. After we paid the bill, they didn't let us stay at the table even though we were waiting for a member of the party to use the restroom. I don't mind being asked to leave but we were bum rushed by 4 staff members. Very rude"}
{"text":"When we travel, we like to go where the locals go and this was the place to go. It's a small, inconspicuous place on a main road. We went on a Sunday morning at the end of July on our way to the Hoover Dam.  It was busy, and there was a bit of a wait, but the line moved right along. The inside had a counter and booths, was decorated with license plates and boat decor (due to Lake Mead being nearby), and it was clean.  Always a plus. The food and the service were excellent. There were five of us in our party and we all were happy with our meals. I had \"The Hangover\", which was biscuits and gravy, with scrambled eggs, and two sausage patties. It was the best and tastiest breakfast I have had in a long time. The other meals that we ordered (pancakes, omelettes), were equally as delicious.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are decent, so if your are in the Boulder City area, check out the Coffee Cup, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I made a special trip to this place from Vegas because we saw it on Triple D. We went on a Sunday and there was maybe a half hour wait. The place is small, but they still don't pack their customers in like sardines. We had space to relax. I am not overly adventurous with food so I just had the two eggs with bacon, toast, and home fries (they had run out of hashbrowns). My meal was just okay, not very flavorful at all. But, the hubby had the famous pork chile verde omelet and he raved about it. I took a bite and even I really liked it, and I don't go for that type of thing. 

I am giving it four stars because of how much my husband liked it. I am sure we will be back, especially since the drive from Vegas wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast on the way to Hoover Dam . It's a family owned business and we felt very welcome . Front desk was courteous ( and beautiful) and she made special effort to seat the 17 of us together.

Foot here is amazing , Omelettes, pan cakes , burgers and all other items we tried were perfect. Even the hash browns were best I ever had. Everything was fresh and tasty. 
They could start a franchise in Bay Area and mint millions . 

Thanks you for the lovely experience and great food."}
{"text":"The Coffee Cup is the place to go. I had the Chili Verde Pork omelet and my brother in -law  had the same , Hash browns were great if you like burnt and crispy yummy . Now the Chile verde  which was very tasty . I might be wrong but I think they use the same pickled jalepenos with verde salsa. It was weak as it was it could just be canned. I like my shit hot & spicy . So I'm giving you guys a four star . Other than that everything was excellent, service, food, ambiance, and atmosphere and we enjoyed our time there."}
{"text":"Although I no longer reside in Henderson, I still don't mind taking a field trip to The Coffee Cup. $9 got me chicken fried steak, hash browns, and pancakes. The service is always prompt and friendly. Just expect a hefty wait on the weekends - especially during the times that Diners Drive-ins and Dives aires the episode of The Coffee Cup."}
{"text":"Wow!  So I went here twice in March, 2016.  Sorry for the late review.  I just want to say this is a \"Happening\" place!  This is an all around great breakfast place to go to in Boulder City, NV.  If I lived in Henderson, or even Vegas, I'd go here now and then for sure!  Each breakfast I had here was excellent, and the service was great!  The prices were also appropriate.  I was mostly impressed however, by the Bloody Marys!  Holy cow!  Best Bloody Mary I've ever had!  If you're ever in Boulder City and you stop in at The Coffee Cup, it is a MUST to have one of their Bloody Marys!"}
{"text":"One of the waitress is is very rude. Not good.  The place is very dusty.  Their food is pretty good and they have a great selection but it doesn't make up for rudeness.  With a name like The Coffee Cup you would think they would have a good selection of coffee to choose from. They only have one type.  Weak dinner coffee."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best country fried steak I've ever had. It's BOSS. In the words of Tracy Jordan, I would take it behind the middle school and get it pregnant.

I made a little road trip to this place after a friend recommended it to me. It was worth the 30 minute commute. 

The coffee was great, the prices were reasonable, the potty was clean... I don't really have much more to state about this that hasn't already been said. 

You cannot go wrong here... It's impossible!"}
{"text":"I absolute love taking a drive out to the Coffee Cup for their Chile Verde con pappas! Hey try their bloody Mary's are delish too."}
{"text":"WOW!!  Lived up to reviews. First ever post on Yelp because this place is so Delish!!  Started out with Bloody Mary, one of the best I've ever had, local Vodka Booze Brothers. My husband ordered Smothered Breakfast Burrito and I Cali Omelet with a side of their famous salsa verde. Both meals were perfecto. I usually can't finish my food but I ate every last bite because I couldn't get enough of the salsa. A must for anyone driving thru Boulder NV. Bon Appetite!!"}
{"text":"Charming restaurant in Boulder City!  Very kitschy decor with old license plates and old water skis hanging on the wall.  I love the small town feel with all the signs from the Rod Runs and events taking place in BC over the years.  We were passing through town to head to Lake Mead and Hoover Dam.  It was late morning on a Sunday and the place was busy but we were able to get a table right away.  

Breakfast was your typical stuff but filling and good.  Very good coffee.  Service was on point.  Prices were a little higher than some of my favorite breakfast restaurants in this neck of the woods.  Definitely one of those places that won't disappoint if you're passing through and want a little taste of local flair."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm not a huge bacon person unless it's the bacon here. Everything I've had is great, service is great, staff is friendly and the Bloody Mary.....if you get one you'll want another. Only downfall, be prepared to wait, especially if it's a weekend but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Weekday lunch; we both had chili burger which consisted of a hamburger patty open face on pieces of bun covered with chili and beans with grated cheese and raw onions.  This seemed to be just ordinary canned chili&beans.  Along with the burger came a side of fries or Cole slaw.  The bill was $16.32 for both [no drink], not including a tip.  For all the hype and previous good reviews we may have expected too much - or - we didn't order the right item.  Bottom line - I see no reason to go back."}
{"text":"OMG.  I woke up a little under the weather and decided on a healthy -- meaning \"big\" -- breakfast.  This place was spot on.  

Two eggs, perhaps the best chicken fried steak I've ever had, hash browns and toast.  Awesome coffee.  

Apparently this place was featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives (I never get those in the right order so if I'm wrong, sorry)  I can see why.  The wait staff was super friendly. The food was amazing. Clearly this place deserves a place on the map.  I will return as soon as I've worked off the ten pounds I gained."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this cute little cafe today. First off I love love love the atmosphere and the whole downtown area. Inside the cafe is super cute as well it feels more like a personal experience rather than a busy cafe just trying to get you in and out. The service was great everyone was very nice and food came pretty quick for how busy it was. My dad had tried the famous Bloody Mary and said it was pretty good. We both had the steak sandwich. It was huge. All the portions were huge. We could have easily shared it. The steak was cooked perfectly it was very juicy and tender. Overall it was quite good. My mom had a chicken sandwich and my brother had chicken fingers which they both said were both good. All came with fries which were some of the best fries I've had and the ranch was really good too. The overall experience was very nice and it was fairly cheap too! Definitely recommend but be prepared to eat a lot!"}
{"text":"I had the Cali omelette and  a side of corned beefhash and the coffee is one of the BEST cups Coffee in Southern Nevada."}
{"text":"Incredible food and perfect service.The chilli verde omelette was spectacular.  I will make sure to visit again and again. Thank you"}
{"text":"I had the Chile Verde and wasn't impressed. The meat was tender but had no flavor. It was not spicy, as I would have liked it. And the Hash browns were over cooked."}
{"text":"The Steven's are awesome!  Early mornings are classic to meet the locals and hang out.  Food is good and great staff."}
{"text":"Bloody mary- THE BEST IVE EVER HAD. They put one crispy bacon dipped in with a couple olives!! Id come back just for their bloody mary.

Grilled chicken sandwich with fries- average.

Pigs in a blanket- nothing special. Just pancakes wrapped in regular pork sausages.

Customer service- Good. Waitress came around every 5 min on average to check in with us."}
{"text":"Way over rated. I ordered a godfather omelette. It was a scoop of last nights spaghetti sauce in a poorly prepared egg lump. I suppose if you like a scoop of spaghetti sauce in an egg lump it wasn't horrible. It's just not at all what I expected. I would have asked for something else had the waitress taken time to make an appearance. The hash browns are average at best. (Slight taste of scorched oil) the sour dough toast was really nice. All the girls are very pretty and sweet in a \"we do this for tips\" strip club sotra way.  

It is a fun venue with a lot of goofy stuff on the walls. It was a semi pleasant experience but neither the food or service was above average.   

With the name, I expected a much nicer coffee"}
{"text":"Always a treat here at the coffee cup.

Nestled in the smallish town of Boulder City you come across the famous little nook for breakfast and lunch. Here you'll find everyday favorites like pancakes, French toast, Ruebens etc.. something for everyone!

 I took the corned beef hash with sour dough toast.. food came out quickly for the large 12top we had. Food was fresh and tasty. Coffee was great as well usually small dinners have burnt flavored crap coffee and theirs was pretty good.

 The bloody Mary's were decent, they are garnished with bacon which was cool. 

If you're in the neighborhood of this place stop on by and give it a shot it won't dissatisfy"}
{"text":"Wait was reasonable for the crowd present. Staff were all moving super fast and all seemed to be in a great mood!  Had coffee (watched the beans being ground and brewed) which was good.  Didn't want too much to eat so decided on the cinnamon roll. Was VERY good. Light and airy with lots of cinnamon (I could have stood more but amount was fine for most) with excellent fresh frosting running onto the plate.  Then finished up with a single biscuit and sausage gravy which was also way above average.  A side of bacon, would have been a good addition.
Going back in the morning to try the chili verde omelette. Person next to me at the counter got one and it looked great!
Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable price family style restaurant.  Gotta try the cinnamon roll... Fresh baked!  My family enjoyed it very much.  Fits right into the atmosphere of the city.  I'm use to strong coffee, but if you don't mind a milder drink, the bean is roasted by a local company... Worth a try!"}
{"text":"We've gone here on Sundays for a couple of years. Normally it's really good. Today they sat us at a soaking wet table, no forks or spoons available. Stirred my coffee with the knife. Food was ice cold. Also they served a little container of liquified margarine with the toast. Nasty. I have always loved the Bloody Mary's too. Today it tasted like a glass of horseradish. I guess it's getting too touristy and they don't care if you come back anymore. It was very disappointing. Too bad, We look forward to driving out here in our old car every week."}
{"text":"Green Chili Verde is KING.  You can even get it in a to-go cup.

I've heard Guy Fieri say on Diner's Drive-ins and Dives that it takes three major things to have a restaurant featured on his show: great food, funky atmosphere, and a good story.  This time, props to Guy because The World Famous Coffee Cup has got all three.

The Coffee Cup is located in Boulder City, thirty minutes outside Las Vegas, between Vegas and the Hoover Dam.  We live in Phoenix so we're very familiar with the road to Vegas.  We became addicted to the Coffee Cup's pork chili Verde on our first visit, several years ago.  Now, it's a necessity to eat at the Coffee Cup every time we drive to Vegas, which is several times a year.  Once, I stopped there with girlfriends after an all-girls Vegas weekend.  My husband was so upset to be missing out on the good stuff, he had me bring a Styrofoam cup full of their pork chili Verde home for him.  One of the other husbands found out about this, so all of us gals ended up getting to-go cups of chili for our men.

The atmosphere is funky, old surfer dude.  Apparently mom and pop were California surfers back in the day.  They're still rebels at heart, but they've brought together their energies to create this great little place.  Being a family run business, there's lots of pictures of family and friends on the wall.  There's also some interesting props and paraphernalia from their hippie / surfing days.  Warms my heart to see a family of nice people working together, serving up great food and enjoying what they do."}
{"text":"I heard about The Coffee Cup from a gal from the yougart shop I eat out when I was asking her about ideas for trips when my Mom visited from California.  So, I had to give it a try since it would be a great day to go to Boulder City and it at a diner.  What I loved was the decor of the diner.  We were seated right away and the menu had a great selection. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The portion sizes were very large and the food was very yummy.  I will be going back soon and I will give more details of the menu and take more pictures of the inside of the restaurant.  All should go here especially if you have out of town guests visiting."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious. We were a party of four and between us we ordered the Big Texan omelette, a BLTA, and two chili verde omelettes. They are known for their chili verde and my husband and friend raved about it the whole meal. The Big Texan looked good as well and my BLTA was generous and perfect. We were there on a Sunday around noon and did have about a 30 minute wait but there are shops all around to explore. So this may be TMI but after the meal we all hit the restroom before getting back on the road and let's just say they could use a plumbing upgrade. There is a sign warning to hold the handle while flushing but I still had to use the plunger they keep to the side and I promise it was just #1 (although my friend went before me and she did more than that LOL)."}
{"text":"This place was great. I had an omelette, built my own because I don't eat meat. The omelette and the hash browns were really good. Also ordered a mimosa, no complaints about that either. I liked the atmosphere here and the waitress was nice.
Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family for years. We love to drive from Vegas just for breakfast or lunch here. The staff is friendly. The food is great && if your traveling thru it's a great food stop after the Hoover dam. The wait is a bit long && parking can be hard but it's a must see hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for business and took a side trip out to Boulder City.

I tend to visit Triple D locations so I wanted to check this place out.  It's pretty relaxed and laid back, but it seems to be mostly for locals, not tourists.  It's very good but not great.

I got the pork chili omelette and the fried pickles.  Both were very good.

I heard the waitress and cook and owner argue several times about if the pork should be chunks or shredded... not sure what that's about.

I would stop by here again if in the area.

I found out later that a pizzeria in town was also on TV, I would have stopped there as well, but didn't know until a few days later...

Boulder city is a nice quaint little town, but it was too hot to walk around.

Parking is on-street but I found a spot very close."}
{"text":"Service is fast, efficient and with a smile at this friendly diner. Breakfast and lunch service only keep in mind. The interior is antique 'kitschy' just like the rest of Boulder City as a whole.

My wife and I settled upon the pork chili verde omelet which certainly wasn't an appealing looking breakfast in presentation (hey its a diner!) but had the perfect spice and delicate taste. 

People think that their coffee is mediocre, but as a coffee snob I thought it was tasty simply drinking straight black."}
{"text":"Good prices and good food. Stopped by here on the way to Hoover dam. Everyone seemed happy with their food. Service was OK. Not good or bad.

Nothing really stood out to me as great. Sometimes I wonder if people have had truly great food before. Granted it's not IHOP or Dennys but it wasn't spectacular either. It's a solid good."}
{"text":"Our stop for breakfast every time we are in Las Vegas.  The interior looks like places in Ocean Beach or Pacific Beach.  The eats are cheap, the coffee is great. I always get eggs, bacon and corn beef hash and always satisfied.  The people are always friendly. It's very kid friendly, though they can run out of high chairs quick, so get there early if you have kids!"}
{"text":"While in Laughlin my wife and I took a side trip and went to Boulder City. I've seen the World famous Coffee Cup on 3D and decided that would be our breakfast stop.
I don't know if it was because we were there the week between Christmas and New Year's or if it's always like this but even at 10:30 a.m. there was a 25-minute wait. We were hungry and the Old Town Boulder City area is cute so we put our names in and waited.
The diner is small but cute. Decorated with all kinds of watersports bric-a-brac and old pictures of water skiers from Lake Mead.
The menu has traditional Diner Fair. Things like bacon and eggs, chicken-fried steak, sausage and eggs, pancakes, french toast and their world famous Chile verde omelette. When it came time to order I went with the Chile Verde omelette and my wife went with the chicken fried steak. The Chile Verde omelette was good but at the risk of upsetting Guy Fieri I will say I've had better. The outlet itself was prepared well but the chili verde itself just didn't have the flavor I was expecting. My wife's chicken fried steak was insanely good. Prepared just right and with the flavor I've never had before from chicken fried steak.
The service was good and the hostesses were friendly. I would definitely consider coming back by where the area again. I just be ready to Waite for a table."}
{"text":"30-40 min wait on Saturday and Sunday, but worth it. I thought I would be disappointed since there is so much hype. I was pleasantly surprised. I had to try the bloody mary. YUM! The pancakes were fluffy, but not thick, and tasty...just the way I like them. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the service. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for breakfast for coming and going to Las Vegas. I recommend everything!! Food is always good but I luv the coffee."}
{"text":"Well Guy did get this one right.

The chicken fried steak was so tender.  The chili verde is tasty.  They did not skimp on the amount of pork in the chili verde!

I would give this place 5 stars but they did not do a good job basting my eggs.  I know it's picky but a breakfast joint has to do a good basted egg.  

Good service and it is a fun diner atmosphere.  Prices are reasonable.  

Also, this place serves liquor.  So, if you like a bloody mary or a mimosa with breakfast give this palce a shot."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday morning before heading to Hoover Dam. Had a 15 minute wait, but it was fine. 

We all ordered coffee and loved seeing what mugs we got. The coffee was good and there were plenty of refills offered. 

One friend ordered Papas con chili Verde with eggs and had great reviews. My other friend ordered scrambled her way and chocolate chip pancakes. I had a short stack with bacon.

None of us were able to finish everything but we were totally full. It was a great start to our Hoover Dam adventure."}
{"text":"From the second you walk in you're hit with an automatic fun atmosphere.  We started with he Bloody Mary's with yummy bacon and all. Ask for half the ice and get an extra kick.  The service was friendly and fast and now the food... 

The pork chili verde omelet. So, so, so good. Pork was tender and juicy. Others got the steak and eggs, pancakes and it was all great. Can't wait to go back.  I would highly recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"Came here for some geocaching and waymarking and of course to make our first stop at the Coffee Cup.  We enjoy watching the food network shows and try to hit new ones up if we can.  This place didn't disappoint, decided that hitting it on a Friday would probably be better than a weekend. We were seated right away (there were only two of us) but the place was packed.  One of us had the Pork Chili Verde Omelet and the other a Ham boardwalk sandwich.  The Chili was AWESOME, there's a reason Guy came here and we're convinced that this time it was legit.  The sandwich was a bit greasy and eggs themselves had NO flavor.  We will definitely be back as the MR loves breakfast and this is such a neat town to explore :)
ONLY downside was waitress finally took our order then we saw her for the check and that was it...while it was busy didn't feel like it was THAT busy."}
{"text":"A group of us came out to Boulder on our motorcycles, just kind of seeing where the day would take us.  We knew there was a parade on the fourth but we headed down and visited this place.  A couple people in our group had been before.  We were seated right away, maybe everyone had already ate and were now out waiting for the parade.  Right away we noticed some of the silverware had some food still stuck to it, no fun!

One of us ordered a bloody mary, with bacon in it and a mimosa.  They were good, and looks like the bloody mary mix is made there, not from the can.  Otherwise we ordered chicken fried steak, pancakes, breakfast burrito, and cornbeef and hash.  The food was good, nothing spectacular or over the top.  The waitress was on top of the service, assuring our plates were picked up and drinks filled.

If we are going out to Boulder again, I would probably say yes to visiting again but not going to make the trek out just for this place.  It worked for a quick breakfast so are bodies were fueled up for some motorcycle fun!"}
{"text":"My triathlon friends and I do a fair amount of training at Lake Mead and we use eating at The Coffee Cup as motivation to get us through our workouts.  We headed over there today after a long bike ride, arriving around noon, which, for a Saturday, meant waiting for about 20 minutes.  The five of us ended up seated at the counter, but that was our choice since we were starving and couldn't wait any longer for a table.  I had the California Omelet (spinach, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and olives) with hash browns and sourdough toast.  I've never had it myself,  but I hear the Pork Chili Verde Omelet is to die for and The Coffee Cup is famous for it.  I was happy with my breakfast and even had some of my coach's pancakes to boot. 
The restaurant is usually packed, but service is great and the food is delicious, so if you have to wait a little while, it's worth it.  If you're ever passing through Boulder City and want to experience a diner atmosphere with small-town ambiance and smiling service, stop in and have a bite!  Have a nice day, y'all!"}
{"text":"On the way to Hoover dam stopped by Boulder city for a quick bite. Another win win diner. We ordered the chicken fry steak and pork chile verde omelette s featured on dinner and drive ins. Foods is out of this world. 

The gravy for the chicken was the best. Definitely coming back. One wait but that's ok it's a testament to how popular and busy this place is. To save some time for a party of 2 ask to be seated at the counter. Excellent excellent excellent"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. Each time was for breakfast and each time I left happy. The staff members are all friendly and the service is fantastic. The food is great, it's diner style breakfast. I've had the Huevos Rancheros, Breakfast Burrito and the Country Omelette.   (The Huevos Rancheros was my favorite, the country omelette was a little heavy on turkey sausage for my liking, and the burrito was great.)"}
{"text":"The food and service is good, but they close at 2 pm and will turn you away like they did to us, even on busy weekends."}
{"text":"Took a ride on our trip to Vegas and found this quaint cozy restaurant on Yelp. Highly recommend the Huevos Rancheros! Friendly owners and great little town. Worth the ride!"}
{"text":"It was good, not great. I think a lot of the hype came from diners, drive ins and dives but I think Boulder City has better dining options if I'm being honest. Love the southwest diner"}
{"text":"Okay, okay, so I'm a little biased since my Dad owns the place, but every time we come down from Seattle for a visit, this cute diner is always busy, always full of happy, friendly folks, and the food is always great!

The pork chili verde is indeed really yummy (it's made by hand and kind of on the fly in huge batches, so depending on the visit, it's sometimes spicier and sometimes milder, but it's always super tasty), but whenever I go I always get \"Linzers Fave\" from the light menu. Not that I don't have a bunch of toast and jelly with it and completely ruin the low-carb aspect of it, but they get the seasoning on the chicken breast and the veggies just right every time. I'm hooked!

PS - Ladies who enjoy their bad-boy biker types will love the scruffy & friendly guys who frequent the place, dudes who like adorable waitresses will most certainly appreciate the young & attractive staff, and everyone can appreciate the more than reasonable prices and fantastic classic diner fare - yay!

Oh, and like some others have mentioned:  the coffee is just your basic diner coffee, so don't go in looking for a double caramel frappuccino mocha latte foofy-foof espresso drink. It's just coffee, like you'd expect at a diner. Not necessarily a bad thing, I don't think ;)"}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious. Did not disappoint. Our waitress was kind of rude and seemed more concerned about the regulars then she did with helping us. Food was great though."}
{"text":"This is our go-to when we have visitors. Their chili verde is excellent. And you have to try the cinnamon rolls. 
They have a full bar, good coffee and it's just a great down-home feeling diner."}
{"text":"I could've sworn that I wrote this review. HMPH!  Well, here it goes:

This is a small, family owned restaurant in charming Boulder City. I was not really that familiar with it until I saw it on an episode of \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\" a few years back. Pro tip: Don't go right after a replay of that episode airs, it gets REALLY busy!

It's not a huge place, but also not tiny. There is counter seating like at an old diner. There tends to be a long wait at peak times on weekends, so be prepared to wait - you can cruise one of the nearby antiques shops while you wait.

They are most known for their chili verde, which you can basically put on everything. This isn't really my flavor, so I tend to order biscuits and gravy or chicken fried steak. Both are good, but not the best I've had.

This is a fun day trip to make to Boulder City. If you do, make sure you stop and eat at The Coffee Cup! It's a great place for a no frills breakfast at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I went to the coffee cup with my boyfriend. I ordered the country omelette. When i got the omelette the eggs were a little watery but i just brushed it off. As i started eating i noticed there were onions in my omelette even though on the menu it didn't say there would be. As rare as it is i have an allergy to onions. Instead of throwing a fit when the waitress came around i decided to let her know that the menu didn't say there would be onions in it. She then proceeded to catch a bad attitude and tell me that the  \"home fires\" in the omelette have onions in them. IF this is true why were my said \"home fries\" just chopped up potatoes that still tasted like dirt (as if they hadn't been washed) AND there were NO red or green bell peppers just giant shopped up russet potatoes and LOTS of onion. She got snappy and then sarcastically asked if i wanted her to take it off the bill. I said no it was fine we'd pay for it (should have said yes). My boyfriend and i then went to the cashier to pay the bill. After waiting for a couple minutes a man showed up to ring us up. He swiped my boyfriends card and then looked at the name. & then said, \"you're Peter?\" is an very questioning tone. My boyfriend hadn't heard the man so the cashier raised his voice and repeated himself. My boyfriend said yes and the cashier said i don't believe you show me your ID. Even though the cashier already swiped his card so if he was an identity thief it wouldn't have mattered. Peter showed him his ID and the cashier got super sarcastic and started harassing us and being a complete a hole for no apparent reason. Long story short the food was bad and the service was even worse. We will never be going back and i am letting all my friends and family know what an awful experience it was for the both of us. You'd think for such a small business their customer service would be excellent. It was the complete opposite.  TWO THUMBS DOWN!"}
{"text":"Spectacular breakfast spot, well worth the side trip when heading to/from Vegas from Arizona. Huge portions of great food, super-friendly service. I've had omelets when I've been here and have had no reason to stray, but from what I've seen, everything is spectacular and there are no bad choices. The joint gets busy on weekends but they are quite efficient at getting people in and out, so the wait hasn't been bad in my experience. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Well of course it's a DDD spot so it doesn't really need any more press. But it also has that small town homey feel that is what makes people keep coming back here. Staff is very friendly, and the food is excellent. And yes, the famous pork chili verde IS as good as they say."}
{"text":"My family LOVES this place!!! We stop in 3-4 times a year always for breakfast. We love the \"feel\" of the place. It's a small town diner, with a surfer/skier vibe and a full service bar!
I got the hangover because I'm a biscuits and gravy guy. My wife got the waffle. No surprise, the coffee is good and your cup will not sit empty. My wife said the waffle was exceptional. It was crunchy on the outside, light and airy inside. She loved the creamy taste. Back to the hangover... This thing is BADASS! The gravy is NOT that prepackaged white paste that other \"restaurants\" use. It is rich, creamy and plentiful. The biscuit was excellent as were the eggs. Give them a try if you're passing through, you'll be glad that you did."}
{"text":"Great owners, yummy food too"}
{"text":"I liked the Southern Cal atmosphere of this Boulder City cafe.  The menu is nothing original but the food is fresh, tasty and quick.  Service is fine and the place makes you feel comfortable even when the bikers are there.  Outside there is always a lot of people-watching as the place is on the main drag.  I like the breakfast but be prepared to wait in line on the weekends.  The pork chile verde is mouth watering."}
{"text":"Went this morning for my birthday with a neighbor's (and another friend) recommendation. I didn't have any preconceived notions on what to expect. Instant service, friendly staff, and no wait. I hear that isn't the norm, but I guess the gods of birthdays heard my (not so) silent hunger cries from my stomach.

I had the downtown omelet and they gladly substituted nasty onions for yummy spinach. The bacon was plentiful and thick, tomatoes were ripe, and the right amount of cheese. As my side I got the short (but HUGE) stack o' pancakes. Not over cooked and butter on top. My friend got the same with a side of fruit. They offered her alternative fruit as she is allergic to pineapple. My hubs is not huge on breakfast, so he opted for a BBQ brisket sandwich. I stole a bite of his meat (no pun intended) and it was juicy and delicious.

 For all three of us the total was $32 and change. Not too bad considering that's what you'll pay at ihop. The coffee kept flowing even after we paid and chatted. The bathroom was weird to get to and small, but I was pleasantly surprised to see scented sugar scrub at the sink. Great experience! I will go back soon for sure."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I really enjoy the quick service and coffee. The breakfast bowl they have with biscuits, graves, eggs, and sausage is amazing. I don't remember the name of it. They are always super busy so be prepared to wait unless ya get lucky."}
{"text":"This is a Diners, Drive Ins and Dives place from the first season. It was delicious. The portions were huge and the food was great. The staff was courteous and it was a great!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit. I believe the hours are 600am to 200pm only. Serves breakfast all day long. Great atmosphere and a lot of locals frequent the place. Unique atmosphere of pictures of local history and sports and water activities. I love the meatloaf sandwich myself. Sadly I only get to visit once a year on my vacation to Las Vegas I always make the ride to Boulder city."}
{"text":"While road tripping from California to Iowa, we decided to look up a couple of places featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and see if they were worth the fuss. 
This place was AMAZING, and by far the best meal we've had on our 10+ day trip.  We stopped for an early breakfast on our way out of Las Vegas, and the charming main drag was a welcome change from the excess of the LV strip.
The Coffee Cup is clearly an institution in the little town of Boulder City, and though it's surrounded by cutesy candy shops and craft stores, this place is the real deal (I love that the workers who built the Hoover Dam used to frequent the place in the 30s).
We had various combinations of the Pork Chile Verde (one omelette and one over hash browns with eggs on top).  This stuff is AMAZING.  The pork is so tender and flavorful and the green sauce is quite spicy without ever ruining the other flavors or leaving your mouth on fire.  Perfect, really.
Pancakes and sausage links were also very good.  Coffee was strong, flavorful diner coffee.
Service was very pleasant and SUPER fast.  When food comes out in less than 5 minutes, you expect that it was reheated, but this was so fresh - the eggs were fluffy and perfectly cooked, the hash browns were crispy and the chile verde was piping hot.
I have no desire to visit Las Vegas again, but this place I would go back for."}
{"text":"The food is ok. I eat here a lot with my father in law who is a boulder local. He loves it! Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong things each time? I just expect more from a joint featured on the food network. Next time I go, I'm trying the pork chile verde. Its what they're famous for but I never tried it. Its not usually my thing..."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, but worth the wait? Not really sure. 

We wanted a nice hearty breakfast before exploring the Hoover Dam, so this was an obvious choice. Also, being a DDD fan I had another reason to stop by to try to Pork Chili Verde Omelette. Although, I was having trouble deciding between that dish and the Huevos Rancheros. I ended up getting the both of best worlds when my boyfriend orders the Huevos Rancheros! They're pretty similar dishes, with some obvious exceptions. The omelette has a lot more pork, and the heuvos rancheros has beans and tortillas. Out of the two, I preferred the heuvos rancheros. The black beans were a nice addition the flavors of the dish. The pork was really tender and flavorful, so if you're a big meat eater, go for the omelette. 

I was also told my a friend I needed to try their \"famous\" bloody mary. I come from Wisconsin where bloody marys are pretty popular and they usually come with enough toppings to make a meal out of, so I have high expectations. This one was very good, but not famous in my mind. It had a really good spiciness level and flavor, but the toppings were lacking in book. Just one piece of bacon, stick of celery, and an olive. 

I won't be going out of my way to come back, but if I'm in the area the wait isn't too crazy, I'll be happy to return!"}
{"text":"Even if all you have is a fresh, hot, sweet, chewy cinnamon roll and coffee, it is worth the drive! But their pancakes are large and to die for. It can be a bit of a wait, but the food, service, and bloody Mary's more than make up for it. GO! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I LOVED THIS PLACE!!!  My friend and I had just driven from Florida and we were slightly exhausted but also exhilarated.  She knows I am a foodie, and asked someone at our hotel where we should go for some breakfast.  When she was told this was the first place to be featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives, she was sold.  We walked up and thought there was going to be a long line, but we were seated right away!! This place has some serious character to it, the street its on and the decor inside and the way you can tell there are people that might eat there every single day..i was in total heaven.  Then i looked at the menu and thought..omg, I want all of the things! The menu is packed full of items that alll sound amazing...i had so much trouble deciding..but eventually went with the cali omlette..and it came with a side of hash browns and a choice of toast..my traveling companion went for a sammich that i think was a BELT..it looked really good..the food all came out in a flash and was so so so tasty..our server was super friendly and this was a really enjoyable meal.  I know that since my friend just moved out to the area, she will be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the 1st time on Saturday and I loved it! Will tell everyone and will be going back! I had a bloody mary which has a strip of bacon in it...delish! The chili verde sauce is to die for! Must try you will be hooked after.."}
{"text":"The coffee here is so horrible that it should be removed from the name and taken out of the coffee & tea category on yelp. A hotel drip coffee maker and grinds makes better coffee. The pork chili verde omelet that is so talked about was disgusting! The pork was so fatty and of cheap quality. The atmosphere is great and the pancakes saved the meal. Go to the Southwest Diner down the street for a much better experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat breakfast. The family own business, the son Terry is super nice. The staff is so so nice, they make you feel like family. Lots of food for the price. It is worth the drive. The walls are covered with lots of interesting items. Fun to look at. They really support our Troops serving our country, which is so cool. Luv their home made pork verde. :):)"}
{"text":"Great service. Great bloody mary's. Good prices. Huevos Rancheros is the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Hey for what it was, I give it five stars. Its just what you would expect in a one horse town like Boulder...your typical hole in the wall dive where the locals flock to get their daily cup of joe and gossip. The waitresses were friendly but a bit scattered brain. Even though its nestled in the middle of a desert town, the interior is decorated like a college kids luau birthday party along with an array of eclectic memorabilia of past patrons. Seated at cafe seating we ordered the buscuits n gravy. Biscuits were good but the gravy was made with canned milk and had a hint of clove or something of the like which I didnt care for. We also had a bacon egg cheese sandwich on toast with hashbrowns and it was alright. And we also had the typical eggs and bacon which was prepared to order. The coffee was not bad...whole lot better than what I have been forced to drink on this #RoadtripUSA"}
{"text":"Cute place in Boulder City.  You have to try the pork chili verde!  The meat was incredibility tender and just the right amount of heat. The staff was really friendly and the decor was fun."}
{"text":"My coffee tasted of lipstick.  I didn't care for the waitress's response.  She said \"Oh\" and brought me a fresh cup.  

Compare this to an incident at Harry's in La Jolla years ago.  There was a foreign object in my omelet.   The waitress apologized profusely, brought me a complete new breakfast, and my meal was on the house.

I think it would have been a nice touch for our waitress to at least apologize.  She may have surmised that my own lips had lipstick residue from kissing Lucinda.  Not so.  The \"Coffee Cup\" was soiled.  Our visit was a weekday morning.  No crowd.  Our food came practically in an instant.

I'm not a fan of blaring music.  Awful Jimmy Buffett tunes blasted forth.   An adjoining annex had a TV blaring, so we sat in the main area.

I don't get the raves about the décor.  It's just a jumble of water skis, old license plates, and photos of miscellaneous vacationers at the lake.  It's not an attractive mess like Blackie's by the Sea.

I awarded this eatery an extra star because the food was pretty good, but not nearly as good as the Bagel Café."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. Love taking my friends here for the first time. Their menu is full of awesome and delicious creations that will fill you up! Their staff is always super friendly and the atmosphere is really fun. I like the way it's decorated on the inside. The cafe was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and is definitely a place to stop by if you're in the Boulder City area. One of my favorite things to order is their hot chocolate. I love their french toast as well as omelettes. Super delicious! They're only open from 6am-2pm I believe. So get there early! Great little shop."}
{"text":"Great food fast service friendly peopleI would definitely recommend itAs a place for breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"Came here cause of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  Wife ordered the pork chili verde omelette with hash browns.  I had the pork chili verde omelette with a short stack of buttermilk pancakes.  My cousin ordered the chicken fried steak.

Did we think the food was good?  Yes, the food was good.  Good diner food, and the prices weren't too expensive either.  I really thought they would have jacked up the prices because they were featured on Triple D, and they are on a lot of reruns of the show.

So, why just 3 stars?  Mr. Fieri really had me hyped up to try the place.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to all his hype (in my opinion).  Honestly, if I had never seen them featured on the show....and I had just happened to stop in and try the place.....I'd be giving them 4 stars instead cause my expectations would not have been so sky high!

Oh well, The Coffee Cup is still a fine diner.  Definitely recommend stopping in and deciding for yourself if you like them.

Would I want to return here?  Yes, I would return here if there were no long lines, and we were in the area."}
{"text":"Visit once a month! Worth the wait. Food & service the best.  Can get crowed. Recommend getting in early, going with a smaller party (easier to seat) and be prepared to wait. They have a Fantastic menu complete with low calorie, low carb and keto options if that's your bag. Never a problem to substitute. Staff is amazing they all work well together bussing each other's tables and sharing the refill responsibilities. It's easy to over tip because the gals work hard and clearly are great at their jobs as it reflects in there pleasant attitudes and genuine smiles."}
{"text":"Great place for a yummy, cheap breakfast. I had the Tuesday special - eggs, bacon and pancakes. Cleaned my plate. Seems like a locals type place and I felt a little out of place walking in. Wasn't sure whether to seat myself or not as there wasn't any staff readily available. I went ahead and sat down which seemed to be ok! Lots of items hanging on walls and ceiling to keep you occupied while waiting for the food to come."}
{"text":"1- great service
2- 10min wait for the food
3- for breakfast, get the tacos! They are not on the menu but were amazing!"}
